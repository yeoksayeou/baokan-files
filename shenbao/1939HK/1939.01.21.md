### Rapid Expansion of Our Nation's Air Force

In recent days, our nation's air force has successively departed for various war zones to bomb × positions. Especially in the South China region, foreign telegrams have repeatedly reported the heroic attacks by our air force. At the same time, news of expanding the air force has also been widely discussed. Looking ahead to the future of the second phase of the War of Resistance, it fills one with infinite excitement and anticipation. Our nation's air force, although only having a short history of a few years, has fully demonstrated its power in the War of Resistance: not only bombing × military positions, achieving great merit, but also performing the feat of showing strength abroad. Recently, taking advantage of the invading × army's stubborn resistance in Guangdong, they have been active everywhere, sinking two × warships in the lower reaches of the Pearl River. The reason why our nation's air force has been able to achieve such great accomplishments and fulfill its responsibility of defending the country with glory is truly due to the central government and Chairman Chiang's efforts to promote it and the enthusiastic contributions of all the people.

The × army's invasion of our country not only uses the air force as an auxiliary force but even uses it to solve some important strategic problems. They often launch large-scale attacks on any location in our country. Recently, as our War of Resistance entered its second phase and a full-scale war unfolded, all routes of the × army were restrained and at a loss; therefore, they dispatched large numbers of air forces to indiscriminately bomb our undefended areas, killing large numbers of civilians, in an attempt to break the will of our people to resist. However, this kind of intimidation not only had no effect but instead made our people's understanding even clearer and their will to resist even stronger. At the same time, it further angered the air force warriors of friendly nations, who, unable to bear witnessing such inhumane attacks, voluntarily came to our country to join the air force and fight against Japan. It is recently reported that five hundred foreign pilots have secretly arrived in China to participate in the war. This is very worthy of our attention.

The air force is a force of attack. As our War of Resistance enters its second phase, the strategy changes from passive to active, and the time for a full-scale counter-offensive is approaching. In order to strike at the × army's rear, disrupt the × army's transportation and communication, weaken the × army's strength, increase the × army's difficulties, and even use it to solve some important strategic problems, it is very important to strengthen the air force. Therefore, our country is now actively expanding its air force organization and strengthening its air force strength. In addition to ordering 200 bombers from the American White Branch Aircraft Company, it has also decided to accept the request of foreign pilots to join the air force to fight against Japan, and the new air force will also be formed and put into combat in the near future. This active measure is also very worthy of attention.

However, since the air force is the main force of attack, the consumption rate of aircraft and air force personnel must be very high. To seek the final victory of the War of Resistance, it is necessary to maintain the superiority of the air force. To maintain the superiority of the air force, it is necessary to be able to replenish it quickly at any time. In order to achieve this goal, we put forward the following two points:

First, superior aircraft replenishment depends on industrial and mechanical efficiency. The backwardness of our country's military industry is undeniable. At present, the supply of aircraft still has to rely on foreign countries, which is the most difficult thing during the War of Resistance. Therefore, at present, we must develop the military national defense industry as much as possible, have the determination to expand the aircraft manufacturing industry and implement practical and feasible manufacturing plans. At the same time, we should also develop factories for manufacturing parts and repairing as much as possible so that we can quickly repair damage before we can mass-produce aircraft. Secondly, because aircraft still have to rely on foreign countries at present, a large amount of funds are needed to purchase them from abroad, so our people should continue and expand the donation movement to purchase aircraft, and launch the movement to purchase aircraft with a tax spirit to celebrate birthdays.

Second, the replenishment of outstanding air force personnel depends on active training. In our country, where technology is relatively backward, it is still necessary to hire foreign experts with rich knowledge and experience to serve as training, but warriors tempered from the War of Resistance should also be regarded as training cadres. At the same time, it is best to send a large number of young people to countries with superb aviation technology for further study to improve the training of our country's hole army personnel. It is also necessary to increase the number of aviation schools in the country and cultivate a large number of aviation personnel with a firm determination to resist and a determination to sacrifice.

Although our nation's air force has made great contributions in the past, its future task is even greater. To complete this greater task, our country's authorities must quickly expand and strengthen it.

### A Week in World Trends From January 14th to 20th, Year 28

— Pan Lang

Another week has passed amidst the fires of war and the noise of the world. In the Far East and in Western Europe, because of the mad arson of the three fascist aggressor countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy, almost the entire world has been set ablaze; and this flame is spreading to the Mediterranean Sea and the Pacific Ocean. But at the same time, the calls and actions of China and Spain, who are steadfastly resisting and bravely putting out the fire, have finally been responded to and aided by countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. The successive ultimatums and stern warnings issued by Britain, the United States, and France to Japan are an example. Looking back at our compatriots under the fire of × people's guns, and the people of Japan, Germany, and Italy who are being squeezed by × people, we truly have infinite pain, but seeing the current difficulties and obstacles, and the bright future, we are filled with infinite excitement and infinite anticipation.

A Week in the War of Resistance

The Japanese invading troops in China have been reorganized for three months, and the commanders-in-chief of North China and Central China have also been changed, but without any achievement. Recently, in order to cooperate with the so-called general offensive of the new Hiranuma cabinet, so as to cheer up the people at home and cover up the failure abroad, they had to launch tentative general offensives in the northwest and southwest. Therefore, in the past week, fierce battles have taken place in all battlefields. First, let's talk about North China. After the failure of the five-way offensive at the beginning of the year, the × army actively reinforced Jinan and northern Henan, and recruited the remaining main force, opening up the Fenxi River along the various roads along the Xiangpu Line to launch a large-scale counter-offensive, attempting to cross the Yellow River by force from Hejin Yumen to threaten Xi'an. The battles have been very fierce in recent days. Fortunately, our army has successively recovered important places in the Lvliang Mountains, and the army that advanced into Lishi Zhongyang Jishan has cut off the × army's intrusion into sections. Now the × army is still preparing to invade westward on a large scale, but our northwest military deployment has been completed. The Eighth Route Army has already penetrated into Rehe, stirring up the flames of war in the rear of the × army, and the guerrilla warfare in the Suiyuan and Chahar provinces has also made progress, apparently isolating the × army that is invading westward. Secondly, the × army in South China has once again launched a fierce offensive north, and the battle in the Conghua Huaxian area is unusually fierce, but the × army has not crossed Taipingchang. In the Xijiang and Nanlu areas, the × army dared not move easily, but both the sea and land routes are actively reinforcing, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. As for the Dongjiang area, our army has been taking the offensive in recent days, and the × army has been forced to retreat and defend. Now, under the active deployment of the Southwest Headquarters, there is no need to worry about the war situation in South China. As for Central China, this week has been relatively quiet. However, the battles in the guerrilla areas on both sides of the Yangtze River have made great progress. Hangzhou has been surrounded by us, and the × army already has the appearance of abandoning its defense. In the vicinity of Suzhou, there have been more than 300 battles of all sizes in the past month, and more than 4,000 × troops have been wiped out. According to General Gu Zhutong of the Third War Area, our army on the eastern battlefield has indeed entered the counter-offensive stage. Looking at the overall situation, although × is eager to move, we have indeed occupied the dominant advantage. In the past week, Japan has wiped out more than 20,000 × troops in Jin and Guangdong alone. Now the entire military deployment has been largely completed; and the widespread establishment of party and government committees in the war zone, the organization of the Guangdong Province War Zone Supervisory Group, the development of the new military industry in the Northwest, and the steady flow of foreign military supplies, and the investment of a large number of military technology experts from the Soviet Union and the United States are all good news that is particularly worth reporting this week.

Major Reforms in Provincial Party and Government Affairs

In coordination with the new development of the military in the War of Resistance, the coordination of party and government affairs and personnel in various provinces also urgently needs to be improved. The reorganization of the governments of Shaanxi and Hunan provinces has been decided by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 17th. In Shaanxi, there have been changes in both military and political affairs. Jiang Qian has taken office as the director of the Northwest Headquarters, and Wei Lihuang and Sun Yunzhong, two soldiers who have repeatedly cooperated with the Eighth Route Army and loyally led the War of Resistance, have been appointed as the commander and deputy commander of the First War Zone, respectively. Jiang Qiwu has been removed from the post of director of the Xi'an Branch and will focus on provincial affairs. As for Xue Yue, who has been appointed as the chairman of Hunan and has been leading the War of Resistance with outstanding performance, it is entirely for the needs of the war. In addition, the governments of the provinces in the war zone are also preparing for reorganization. For example, Li Zongren is about to take charge of Hubei, and Sun Lianzhong is about to take charge of Henan, although this has not been confirmed, but in order to closely coordinate the administration of the provinces with the military in the second phase of the War of Resistance, this kind of preparation is indeed possible and necessary. According to the Chongqing airmail of this newspaper, "The organization of the Party and Government Committee of the War Zone has been expanded. Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, the chairman of the Kuomintang, will serve as the chairman concurrently, and Li Jishen will serve as the vice chairman. There will be seven to eight committee members, four of whom will be Kuomintang members, and two to three of whom will be Communist Party members. Except for Zhou Enlai, who has been confirmed, the rest of the candidates are still being considered." This is also worth paying great attention to. Because in the past 18 months of the War of Resistance, although there has been unprecedented progress in military and political affairs, this progress is not enough to stop the Japanese from attacking and launch our army's counter-offensive, and the obstacles on the road to progress still exist seriously, especially the lack of consolidation of the anti-Japanese front and the continued development of the phenomenon of party friction. The expanded organization of the Party and Government Committee is the best remedy. On the one hand, it can fundamentally smash the × people's conspiracy to destroy our unity by borrowing slogans such as anti-communism, anti-Eighth Route Army, and anti-border area. On the other hand, it will definitely be of great help to mobilizing the whole people to complete the cause of resisting Japan and building the country. It is hoped that it can quickly become a reality after this Fifth Plenary Session.

The Fifth Plenary Session Opens!

As the War of Resistance enters a new stage, on the one hand, there are many new progress and successes that are exciting, and on the other hand, there are many new difficulties that need to be solved urgently. The Kuomintang, the largest political party leading the national war of resistance and nation-building, is holding a central plenary session at this time, which is naturally worthy of the attention of both China and foreign countries.

According to the Associated Press, the topics of this plenary session will be: (1) Reaffirm national policies to enhance the strength of the long-term war of resistance. Support Chairman Chiang and government leaders: (2) Strengthen unity, enhance the anti-Japanese front, and concentrate national manpower and material resources to clarify the final victory; (3) Unite all democratic countries that sympathize with China to form an international anti-Japanese front; (4) Establish special agencies to liaise with all parties and factions; (5) Reorganize the "Three People's Principles Youth League" to accommodate the youth of all parties and factions; (6) Strengthen democratic organizations and quickly establish national political councils in provinces, cities, and counties; (7) Improve county administrative organizations: (8) Improve the national conscription system; (9) Thoroughly eliminate traitors; (10) Improve the combat capabilities of the army; (11) Organize student soldiers; (12) Strengthen the political training organization of the army; (13) Improve the material life of the army and promote cooperation between the military and civilians, (14) Implement economic policies and build military industry; (15) Confiscate all traitor property; (16) Encourage the rich to donate; (17) Further reduce the salaries of government officials at all levels; (18) Reduce miscellaneous taxes and increase wartime production; (19) Levy property taxes; (20) Improve people's lives and solve the problem of youth unemployment; (21) Promote thrift movements; (22) Guarantee people's freedom of publication, assembly, and association; (23) Promote mass movements: (24) Implement wartime education to enhance the strength of the War of Resistance. These are all the problems that urgently need to be solved at the current stage, and they are also the problems that the people of the whole country jointly demand a fair solution. Even the points raised by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party are mostly included, which is enough to show the true attitude of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang. Our people and overseas Chinese all over the country should use all methods to support the Central Committee and support the Fifth Plenary Session to give the most fatal blow to the × people and traitors, and to open up an unprecedented progressive and glorious era for the Chinese people.

Britain, the United States, and France Jointly Contain Japan

Only by uniting and persisting in the War of Resistance can we win more and greater international assistance, and only by cooperating with more and greater international assistance can we achieve success in our War of Resistance and nation-building ahead of schedule. Now Britain, the United States, and France, like the Soviet Union, have been moved and trusted by our country's unity and War of Resistance, and in order to protect their own interests and world peace, they have begun to take active steps to aid China and contain Japan. Following the United States' tough ultimatum to Japan at the end of last year, the British government also sent a "message that was unprecedentedly tough from the British government after the Sino-Japanese War" to Japan on the 14th of this month, expressing that it would never recognize any situation created by force, firmly oppose Japan's so-called New Order in East Asia, and oppose the destruction of the Nine-Power Treaty; and it more clearly expressed that Britain's Far East policy would stand on the same front as the United States. On the 19th of this month, the French government also sent a similarly tough ultimatum to the Japanese side, taking a consistent attitude with Britain and the United States. As a result, the call for Britain, the United States, and France to jointly implement retaliation against Japan immediately spread from Europe and the United States to Asia and all over the world. The 400 million people seeking freedom were cheered up by it, and the Japanese aggressors could not help but tremble and lose their composure. On the one hand, they instigated domestic newspapers to abuse and rant wildly, severely criticizing the aid of Britain, the United States, and France to our country, expressing infinite resentment; on the other hand, they used diplomatic tactics. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informally issued deceptive remarks that "Japan is preparing to negotiate" in an attempt to ease the anti-Japanese sentiments of various countries. However, in fact, Japan's development in the Far East is obviously incompatible with the ideals of Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and all peace-loving and just people in the world. This trick of the Japanese aggressors will ultimately be difficult to succeed. Now let me report a few new facts about international aid to China: (1) On the 11th, the Chongqing National Diplomacy Association received a letter from the World Scholar Squad representative stating that youths from 54 countries are willing to fight to aid China's War of Resistance, and the World Youth Conference has decided to organize two special fighting committees to aid our country; (2) After the establishment of the Sino-US loan, the first batch of military supplies has arrived this week; (3) More than 500 flight personnel from the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and France have come to China to participate in the War of Resistance; (4) American Fei Wusheng, chairman of the International Relief Association, declared on the 17th that millions of Americans are fighting to aid China's War of Resistance against Japan.

Regular Meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council

The 103rd regular meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council was held on the 16th of this month. The main issues of this meeting were, first, the issue of the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers from Spain, and second, our country's request to sanction Japan. Gu Weijun, our country's representative, delivered a strong speech on the 17th, requesting (1) to implement financial and economic sanctions against Japan, (2) that member states of the League of Nations uniformly boycott all Japanese goods, (3) to ban the transport of raw materials that can be used to manufacture military equipment to Japan, (4) to especially ban the transport of aircraft and gasoline, (5) that member states of the League of Nations provide effective economic assistance to China, (6) to simplify the transportation of military supplies to China, and (7) to establish a special committee in the Administrative Council, with the participation of all countries with interests in the Far East, to consider the methods that member states should take against Japan and to prevent its continued war. Gu also specifically pointed out that other countries' assistance to China in expelling the aggressors is also in their own interests because once China is liberated, it will make a major contribution to world trade. The whole country of China is united, and the military has adopted new strategies, and the future has turned bright; if various countries provide more substantial assistance, then victory is imminent. On the 18th and 19th, the committee composed of representatives from the central government, France, and the Soviet Union held closed-door meetings successively. On the afternoon of the 19th, the Administrative Council convened a secret meeting to discuss the various points applied for by our country. Before Britain and France have fundamentally abandoned their policy of appeasement towards the fascist aggressors, we still cannot have any extravagant hopes for the League of Nations. However, the current international situation has indeed dramatically turned in our favor. We must seize the opportunity and strive for more and greater foreign aid under the principle of self-reliance. The United States has now organized a committee specifically to discuss economic sanctions, which should have a considerable enlightening effect on the countries of the League of Nations. We must more broadly mobilize Chinese and foreign public opinion, launch a global anti-fascist and anti-aggression mass movement, and urge the governments of various countries to effectively implement the policy of uniting and sanctioning the fascist aggressors.

Japan Plots New Conspiracies

As the international situation becomes more and more unfavorable to Japan day by day, Japan has immediately issued peace talks, declaring that it is willing to jointly promote peace with Britain, and expressing to the United States that Japan is willing to negotiate the opening of the Chinese market. The ×× speech delivered by Mitsumasa Yonai, the Japanese ambassador to Britain, at a banquet on the evening of the 18th, is an example. But in reality, the diplomatic policy of the Japanese government has completely become a tool for the fascist warlords to carry out their strategic intentions, and this deceptive trick of Japan has long been seen by the international community. Moreover, the policy guidelines that the Hiranuma cabinet is preparing to announce today (the 20th) clearly stipulate: (1) Japan will resolutely achieve the goals set by this China Incident based on its unchanging policy, (2) Japan suggests creating a New Order in East Asia, which will be practiced along the "Heaven and Earth Avenue", (3) Japan will continue to strike at the anti-Japanese Kuomintang regime, (4) Japan will strive to promote understanding with third countries, (5) Japan's final goal for this Sino-Japanese War lies in the cooperation between Japan, "Manchukuo," and China, and the "transformation" of China, (6) Because there are still many obstacles at present, all national resources should be concentrated to achieve this goal. In addition, Hiranuma also plans to ask the Diet to approve his budget案 and other laws. Foreign Minister Arita will also deliver a long diplomatic speech, stating: "(1) Japan's diplomatic policy is in the construction of the 'New Order in East Asia' (2) Third countries have so far failed to understand Japan's true intentions, and Japan will take necessary measures after third countries transport weapons to China through the southwest and other routes to aid China's War of Resistance." More filled with threatening tone. In addition, such as the reorganization of the military, the strengthening of national mobilization agencies, and the plan to greatly expand the army, navy, and air force, all prove Japan's ambition to conquer China and even conquer the Pacific.

The Last Days of the Aggressor Nations

In addition to Japan, the madness of the fascist aggressor nations to prepare to expand the war and the actions of Germany and Italy this week are also very noteworthy. First, let's talk about Germany. On the one hand, it is trying its best to woo Thailand. Goering and Ribbentrop will both go to Poland to carry out activities. On the other hand, it is using Hungary, resulting in the fact that Hungary has withdrawn from the League of Nations and joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. At the same time, the establishment of the German-Turkish lending agreement and the conspiracy to deeply enter the Middle East can be considered to have been initially achieved; therefore, "bomb news" such as attacking the Netherlands and inciting chaos in Ireland has appeared in the newspapers! Secondly, let's talk about Italy. Although this British-Italian Parliament talks failed to achieve the expected success, Chamberlain and Daladier's lack of determination to defend peace by armed force is extremely obvious, so he intensified his steps to attack Spain, attempting to quickly overthrow the Spanish Republican government and establish his military and economic foundation in Spain; on the one hand, he once again launched an anti-French movement, actively increasing troops in North Africa and East Africa, and stepping up military preparations to dominate the Mediterranean Sea. The further aggression of Germany and Italy is not only completely united, but also closely linked with Japan in the East. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita has already announced the content of his speech to be delivered today, openly boasting that the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact has reached the ideal of the world's anti-communist camp due to the recent addition of Hungary and Romania, and is opposed to countries that advocate maintaining the status quo." However, as the aggressive countries become more rampant, their internal crises have reached a point where they cannot be concealed or salvaged. American journalist Sims publicly revealed in Washington on the 10th of this month that the internal struggle in Germany is becoming more and more serious, and the workers' sabotage and anti-war movements are becoming more and more intense! Japan's economic crisis is even more serious. The main reasons are the lack of materials, the reduction in export quotas, the depletion of gold, the exhaustion of foreign exchange funds, inflation, and the difficult lives of the people. All the Hiranuma cabinet can do about this is to use increased force to extract funds from the people to support the war!

The Soviet Union is Making Smooth Progress

In this war-torn world, only the Soviet Union, under the leadership of socialism, is victoriously advancing on the road to freedom and happiness. They are determined to uphold the policy of maintaining peace by force and helping oppressed peoples to liberate themselves, and they are fighting unyieldingly. Today, January 21st, in order to commemorate Lenin, the revolutionary leader of the world, they have launched a mass movement on a national scale. They will issue a serious warning to the fascist aggressors such as Japan, Germany, and Italy, and at the same time, they will express their highest respect to the 500 million people in China and Spain who are bravely uniting to resist aggression. They have already prepared to use the fact that they are strengthening their naval and air forces as a guarantee for this warning and tribute. The Supreme Soviet has divided the People's Committee of Defense Industry into four committees: aviation, shipbuilding, ammunition, and military equipment. The naval and machinery committees will also strive for development. As of the first day of this year, aircraft production has increased by 15% to 26%. Other defense industries will be developed, and up to 29 people's committees related to national defense will be established. Of the 100 million pounds added to the budget, 400 million will be used to develop military industries. At the same time, they called on the people oppressed by the fascist aggressor nations to unite under the banner of anti-fascism and anti-aggression and work together to stop the new imperialist war. The Soviet Union's experience of reaching the most prosperous, freest, and happiest state today from the most dangerous, most difficult, and most impoverished state in the past 21 years is a good example for our War of Resistance today, and the Soviet Union, which is victoriously advancing today, has united with all the democratic and peace-loving countries in the world to become our friendly army. What reason do we have to be pessimistic and fearful? Let's work hard! Our team is the largest and strongest in the world!

### Research on Resistance War Tactics and Important Tasks for Improving Troops (Middle)

— Chiang Kai-shek

If we want to utilize this tactic to bring out the effectiveness of the War of Resistance, there are still several most important conditions: First, senior commanders must have unwavering determination. If they are determined to attack, they must succeed; if they are determined to defend, they must hold until the last man without retreating. Once the determination is made and the intention is clear, they should not waver due to minor setbacks, nor should they stop halfway. Only in this way can they accomplish the tasks of attack and defense. Recently, I met with officers returning from the front, and they said that the most unfavorable thing in this operation was that our senior commanders lacked determination, or their determination was insufficient. They did not have the true determination to defend places that should be defended, and they wasted many unnecessary sacrifices in places that did not need to be defended! They also said: "When we were ordered to attack, we did not see the determination to conquer, and often we were ordered to stop halfway. When we were ordered to defend, we did not see the intention to defend, and often we were asked to withdraw before we could defend for a while! In fact, as long as our subordinates, the senior commanders, are determined that a certain town must be conquered, or a certain position must be defended to the death, we will do our best to do it until all officers and soldiers are sacrificed! Therefore, in future operations, the overall plan for attack and defense must be decided clearly, and the order must be firm. All places that should be defended should be ordered to be defended to the death. Even if only one person is sacrificed, we must die rather than leave. All places that should be conquered should be ordered to be attacked. Even if the obstacles are extreme, we must attack to the death! Their criticism is very valuable, and all senior commanders must pay special attention to it. In particular, the chiefs of staff and directors of staff offices of all units must pay attention to improving, and must convey these ideas to commanders at all levels and implement them earnestly! In future operations, determination must be firm so that orders can be carried out thoroughly. Only when orders can be carried out thoroughly can victory be assured! (To be continued)

### We are Besieging Quwo and Jiang County. The Enemy at Yumen Shijiatan Still Trying to Cross the River. Fierce Battles Continue on All Fronts in Western Shanxi.

[This newspaper, Xi'an, 20th] Fierce battles continue on all fronts in western Shanxi. The enemy at Yumen Shijiatan is still trying to cross the river to invade. After being severely bombarded by our artillery, they suffered heavy casualties. There are also fierce battles near Hejin Xiangning. Our guerrillas attacked Yuncheng and made considerable gains.

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 19th Dispatch] Since the 17th, our large army has been besieging Quwo and Jiang County. The enemy is holding the city to the death. The battle situation is very fierce and is continuing. The Fenyang regiment is reinforcing Lishi and was intercepted by us in Wuchengzhen.

[Minge News Agency and Jishi, 20th] After our troops in western Shanxi fought and returned to Ji and Yumen, they gradually advanced. Now they have all approached the vicinity of Helu and Tongbulu. Our troops in southeastern Shanxi are also advancing towards Tongbulu. The enemy at Houma is surrounded by our large army. The enemy is extremely panicked in the Linfen Hou area and constantly uses planes to scout along the road, and automatically destroys highways and railways to prevent our army from advancing.

[Minge News Agency Xingji, 20th Dispatch] The enemy from Xixiang Qinghuazhen constantly harasses the Quaner Shang Wuzicun area. After being repelled by our army, our army destroyed several sections of the Shuiji Wuxingcun railway and recovered five or six li of power lines. At night, our unit raided Dongzhangcun and killed more than forty enemies.

[Minge News Agency Jingle, 20th Dispatch] The Hebei enemy is closely deploying to besiege Diannan in an attempt to eliminate our anti-Japanese armed forces.

In recent days, the enemy has also threatened to gather troops to attack Wuyuan, but there is still no movement.

### Our Elite Troops Arrive at the Guangdong Border. Guangdong's Defense Becomes More Solid. Bai Chongxi and Huang Xuchu Summoned to Fly to Chongqing.

[This newspaper, Guilin, 10th Dispatch] The new army has arrived at the Guangdong border, and the defense of Guangdong Province has become more solid.

[This newspaper, Guilin, 19th Dispatch] Bai Chongxi, director of the Southwest Military Affairs Office, and Huang Xuchu, chairman of Guangdong, were summoned to fly to Chongqing on the 19th.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 20th] A Chinese military spokesperson said that Japanese warships are slowly sailing up the Xijiang River. At the same time, 2,000 Japanese troops are in Jiujiang, 3,000 are concentrated in Sanshui, and 4,000 are concentrated near Zhaoqing. Therefore, it is predicted that the Japanese army will advance into Heshan. It is also said that the Japanese army that invaded north from Guangzhou launched an offensive towards Conghua this week, but was repelled by the Chinese army. The Japanese army retreated to its original position in Taipingchang.

[Hong Kong News] According to the German newspaper "De Chen Xi Bao" yesterday, the French flagship "Ping Jie Hu", which was stationed in Shanghai, suddenly received an urgent order to head south. It is expected to be closely related to the Japanese army's plan to invade Beihai and spy on Hainan. According to news from Annam, the French authorities are paying close attention to the development of the military situation in the Leizhou Peninsula recently and have ordered all navies in the Far East to concentrate in the Gulf of Tonkin. There is also similar news in Hanoi. According to observations from Annam, the Japanese army will land in Beihai within the next two or three days in an attempt to invade Guangxi and cut off the transportation between Annam and Guangxi. At present, the number of Japanese warships surrounding Weizhou Island has increased, and Japanese aircraft have been inspecting the coast of Beihai for days. According to Western news, there has been continual activity by the Japanese army in Guangzhou.

[Macau, 20th Foreign Telegraph] According to reports here, the war on all lines in Guangdong Province has been launched. The Japanese army has repeatedly attacked the Chinese army's positions in Conghua, but has been repelled. The Japanese army in Dongjiang is also quite困困 by the guerrillas. However, the Japanese army in Sanshui, with the power of aircraft and artillery, made slight progress yesterday. A small town several miles away from Sanshui was occupied by them.

### Japanese Politician Adachi Gives a Speech. Wantonly Attacks England.

[Tokyo, 19th Foreign Telegraph] Adachi, the president of the "National Alliance Society," a small party in the Japanese House of Representatives, said in a speech at the party's congress today, roughly saying that the British ambassador to Japan, Sir Clark, submitted a note to Foreign Minister Arita on the 14th of this month. Although its content is also related to Japan's China policy, its significance is completely different from the note submitted by the United States. The motivation of the British note is not only to maintain treaty rights, but also to further provide moral assistance to Chairman Chiang. In addition to lending China 10 million pounds, the United Kingdom also supplied 60,000 military fires and military equipment between November and December of last year, which were transported into China via Burma. I am afraid that the country may instigate other countries to jointly impose economic sanctions on Japan, so the people of the whole country must be strictly vigilant. We should strengthen military operations on the one hand to overwhelm the 'Chiang regime' and prepare to deal with the worst changes on the other hand." Adachi also advocated the establishment of a "Continental Affairs Department" in all universities to enable the people to better understand the severity of the current situation.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 20th] The Japanese-Chinese pro-military mouthpiece "Continental News" published an article today that made a shocking clarification of Japan's Far East policy that has not been made so far. The article said, "We are not surprised by Britain's concern and worry about the situation in China and disagreement with Japan's unilateral modification of the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, it is what we want. Japan has many representatives, who have been frankly and correctly explaining Japan's policy towards China at home and abroad, giving a major blow to Britain's Far East policy for nearly a hundred years."

[Beiping, 19th Foreign Telegraph] Doiherihara plans to discuss expanding the power of the provisional government joint conference again, but there are no specific measures yet. According to the奸奸, which is close to the Japanese, Doiherihara's current task is to sell "peace" to China. Generally, in the next few months, the Japanese "peace" conditions will be very tempting. In the Chinese newspapers here, there is plenty of evidence of the Japanese urging us to surrender.

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 20th] The Central Executive Committee recently ordered party headquarters at all levels that, during the national crisis, all party affairs workers should make double their efforts for the cause. Recently, it has been found that some members of party headquarters at all levels have been appointed but have not asked for a leave of absence or have not taken up their posts, or have made excuses not to go, or have not gone to the party headquarters to work even after taking up their posts. There have also been resolutions to send them to guide in other counties, but they have not been dispatched despite not holding important military and political positions. Such situations are truly unspeakable in the party and hinder the progress of party affairs. Therefore, party headquarters at all levels should investigate and replace them. Those working comrades who leave their posts without following the leave regulations should be severely dealt with by the chairmen of the committees. The order has been distributed to the party headquarters of all provinces and counties for compliance and to instruct their subordinates to follow suit.

### Our Army Prepares to Encircle and Suppress. Changshu, Kunshan, Jiangyin. Troops Have Advanced to Areas Along the River. Puppet Troops defected with arms in recent days.

[This newspaper, Shanghai, 20th Dispatch] Chang, Kun, and Cheng, Xu Fengzao, Zhao Peizhi, Yang Xingfang, and other puppet generals and captains of the appeasement team, willingly accept the Japanese envoys, recognize the Japanese as their fathers, and endanger the local area. Our troops stationed on the north and south banks of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have reached a grand union and are determined to suppress them. Tai Jiandong, Cai Jiqi, and other units have advanced to the area along the river and various urban areas. There have been battles in Xupu Changyinsha and other places every day. Also, puppet troops Zhang Mufang is secretly cooperating with us. Some of them defected with arms one after another, and the rest seem to be waiting for an opportunity to respond.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 20th] According to unverified news from the Chinese side, the Chinese regular army has arrived in Minhang Songjiang, intending to cut off the Shanghai-Hangzhou transportation line.

### Chairman Chiang concurrently serves as Chairman of the National Political Council

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th] The Chairman of the National Political Council was originally filled by Wang Jingwei. Wang has now been expelled from the party and removed from all his positions. Regarding the position of Chairman of the National Political Council, it is now known that the Central Executive Committee's 111th Standing Committee has resolved to nominate President Chiang to serve in the position.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 20th Military] According to Chinese sources, at this meeting of the Central Executive Committee of the Nationalist Party, it is not planned to nominate a Vice President. Although there was a previous saying that Sun Zhe would be nominated, it is feared that it will not come to fruition, because there is no longer any need for it.

### Chairman Chiang's Circular Telegram to the Country, Encouraging Local Gentry and Educators.

Editor's Note: The original telegram was received yesterday morning, but the code was unclear, and there were many omissions (as seen in the newspapers published). In order to be cautious, this newspaper has specially verified and corrected it before publishing it.

To the Provincial Governments of each province. Provincial Party Headquarters, Municipal Governments, Municipal Party Headquarters, and forwarded to the gentry and educators across the country: The War of Resistance has entered its later stages. Success or failure, survival or death, depends on whether we can promote the national righteousness to enrich the strength for long-term combat. It especially depends on the people of prestige in urban and rural areas across the country, who resolutely take saving the nation and seeking survival as their own responsibility. For thousands of years, our country has taken loyalty and filial piety as the foundation of the country. Self-cultivation and helping the world are regarded as the foundation, and it has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Those who agree with it are admired by the world, and those who violate it are despised. This is the special intention of our sages, who have painstakingly promoted it, and has formed a national unified will to serve as a resource for survival and struggle. President Sun Yat-sen's theory of our national morality specially marks loyalty and filial piety as the first priority. In today's time, when we are fighting to the death with the cruel Japan, it is impossible to revive our homeland and protect our nation unless we swear to be loyal to the country and do our best to be filial to the nation. As the saying goes, the wind moves the grass. Also, as the saying goes, "hearing something, doing something first." The effect of the realization of things has always been attributed to the power of the public, and the responsibility of advocating is actually in the local heroes and outstanding people. If we do not promptly rise up today, practice what we preach, and do our best for our country, exhaust our responsibility to defend the country and the nation, and preserve the legacy of our ancestors, then we will inevitably sit and watch our descendants be slaughtered and enslaved. Being disloyal and unfilial, not only will we have no face to face our ancestors, but we will also be despised by the people of the world. Master or slave, honor or disgrace, we must compete for this moment. This is what our compatriots across the country, especially the local wise men, should deeply and quickly reflect on. The cruel Japan has invaded our country and肆肆 poison. From the three northeastern provinces to North China, Central China, and South China, wherever the Japanese knives have reached, they have not been spared from burning, robbing, poisoning, and destroying production. Tracing its obvious sinister intentions, it not only wants to destroy our country, but also to eliminate our race. Fortunately, since the War of Resistance, relying on our national military and civilians who deeply understand the great righteousness of loyalty and filial piety, they have vowed to make a deadly Zhou Xuan with the cruel Japan; or take the lead in carrying weapons, sacrificing blood and flesh in the front; or donating money and materials to help the army, destroying their homes and relieving the disaster; or exhausting their labor, enduring hardships, to engage in increased production and make up for the losses and destruction during the war. Therefore, united efforts are made, unyielding, and struggling arduously. Our country's War of Resistance has lasted for nineteen months. Although the Japanese soldiers have invaded deeply, their predicament of being trapped in a quagmire and struggling to advance or retreat has become even worse. Today, the international situation of Japan is deteriorating day by day, and its national strength has been exhausted. It is filled with the terrifying phenomenon of impending collapse. All war situations, one after another, are evolving just as we initially predicted. The goal of final victory is approaching us day by day. However, on the other hand, precisely because the Japanese know that they are on the verge of danger, they will inevitably exhaust their remaining strength to attempt a last desperate struggle. At this time, if any of our compatriots are slightly slack, then not only will all previous efforts be lost, but the tragedy of defeat and death will be imminent. If we can see through their dangers, strengthen our roots, and rely on our vast land and large population, and strive to enrich the supply of manpower and material resources, then we can overcome the cruel Japan and complete the great cause of national revival. This is truly the time for our entire country, especially the local wise men, to serve our lives in time. It is also the fate of our country for thousands of generations. Regarding enriching manpower and material resources and strengthening the power of resistance, the central and local governments should intensify efforts and promote them rapidly. In particular, this chairman sincerely hopes that the gentlemen and educators of knowledge, talent, and local reputation in all parts of the country will each serve their country, do their best, and advocate for the sake of the government and promote the rapid completion of achievements. The main points are as follows: First, assist the government in promoting military service to replenish the troops urgently needed for the War of Resistance. On the one hand, publicize the cruel facts of the cruel Japan and the relationship between the success or failure of the War of Resistance and the implementation of military service as much as possible to arouse the anti-Japanese consciousness of the people and promote their enthusiastic recruitment. On the other hand, the drawing of lots, punishing deserters, rewarding those who enlist, and caring for the families of those who go on expeditions should be assisted in various ways with local strength to ensure that the people are happy to join the army and rest assured to go to war. At the same time, the sons of the local gentry should take the lead in sending recruits to the army or sending them to take various military academies, regardless of whether they are selected or not, in order to advocate. The people will naturally follow suit. Then there will be countless fighters in the front, and the victory will be assured. Moreover, after the establishment of the conscription system, the conscription will be abolished, and the construction of the country and the security of the people will be supported for a long time. The credit lies in the country, and there is no end to it. It is not only the children who are famous in history, but also fulfill the meaning of loyalty and filial piety. Second, actively develop the local economy to replenish the sources for long-term resistance. Modern warfare is completely a total final of manpower and material resources. Moreover, at present, the occupation of several important cities in our country and the obstruction of foreign transportation ports have severely damaged industrial and commercial institutions, and all material resources are difficult to supply. Moreover, most of the people who have been employed in industry and commerce abroad have terminated their professions and returned to their hometowns due to war relations. Based on this fact, we should take this opportunity to correct the past mistake of focusing on urban construction, and establish a planned and organized development of the inland economy. On the one hand, it should maintain the supply of military needs for the War of Resistance, and on the other hand, it should establish a self-sufficient foundation for the people's daily necessities. Everything from opening up wasteland, afforestation, animal husbandry, to increase rural production; increase the production of raw materials, how to adapt to local conditions, raise funds and gather strength, and divide labor and cooperate, are all expected by our local sages to carefully purchase, and be念 念in all aspects of the economy. The government will definitely do its best to assist, especially. In particular, for the small-scale handicrafts of various families, which have always been developed in our country, are the most convenient to obtain materials, the widest to use, and the easiest to achieve results, the local gentry should make full use of the original foundation and provide assistance to support them, or expand their production, or improve the methods, or only expand their sales channels. All products that are beneficial to practical use, beneficial to the people's livelihood, and sufficient to supplement wartime needs should be used to the best of their ability. The chairman has often said that the key to the victory of the War of Resistance must be sought from doing no " idle people," " waste materials," " waste dumps," and " waste time," and that the goal of eliminating these four "waste" must be from the development of the local economy, increasing agricultural production, and actively assisting manual industries. It is believed that with the abundance of our country's products and the prosperity of manpower, if we can organize precisely and use it flexibly, then just by sustaining the economy, we can contain the Japanese army to death. The above two are the most simple and easy things to do in the general mobilization of our War of Resistance, and also the source of our military and financial resources for the War of Resistance. Since the Japanese invasion of the country three years ago, the recruitment of soldiers has been downgraded again and again. Now, people who do not meet the specified specifications have also been forced to enlist. The issuance of wartime public bonds has reached a total of 900 million yen. The temporary demands and voluntary donations are not included. Compared with each other, what our people bear and the obligations they fulfill are very different. What's more, our people are the country that is being invaded, and is the point that they survive or die, and the government still expects that our fellow countrymen will make efforts that are so easy. If the local gentlemen who have the responsibility to lead the people cannot personally lead the way, or cannot fulfill their responsibilities, then they are not what our people who have been baptized with thousands of years of loyalty and filial piety are willing to do. Furthermore, our millions of soldiers are fighting bravely on the battlefield, and tens of millions of compatriots in the occupied areas are suffering from the destruction of the cruel Japanese, fighting in a precarious situation. All compatriots should mobilize in the spirit of this and give as much support as possible, sharing joys and sorrows, to show the determination of the front and rear to hate the Japanese. All those who ban gambling, eliminate the opium trade, ban pornography halls, and correct all ills, the local gentry and educators must set an example, strongly advocate, and assist the government in its earnest implementation, directly transforming the local atmosphere, and indirectly enhancing the strength of the rear. Throughout ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, there has never been a country that can achieve prosperity and strength with decadent customs. And the transformation of world customs and customs has never relied on a few virtues and morals, who are good at advocating and advocating. This chairman has been entrusted by his compatriots to take on the heavy responsibility of presiding over the overall situation of the War of Resistance. He is working hard day and night to achieve the goal of winning the War of Resistance and building the country, and his spirit and mind are always in communion with the sages. I sincerely believe that the completion of this arduous mission cannot be achieved by one person, and it must rely on the sages of the whole country to work together in one mind and one virtue to make the best use of their talents and materials. Only then can we reap the benefits of the collective effort. I firmly believe that the sages of our country will all be able to express their sincerity and fulfill their responsibilities, and exhaust their unfulfilled strength to live up to the expectations. As for local advantages and disadvantages, and the hardships of the people, the sages in our region, based on their service experience, are welcome to state the facts truthfully, provided that they are beneficial to the facts, and we must adopt them sincerely and use them as a guide for discussion. Words cannot express everything, but only hope to work hard in time to achieve the success of long-term resistance and victory over Japan, and to complete our task of self-help and saving the country.

### Southwest War Situation Released by the Southwest Military Affairs Office

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 19th] The Southwest Military Affairs Office Released on the morning of the 19th, the general situation of the Southwest war as follows:

Southern Anhui Front

(A) Xuanwu front, about 2,000 enemies entrenched in Xuanwu, launched猛猛attacks on the positions of our 某某师 in two routes in early旬. At that time, the battle situation in the近 suburb of northwest Yicheng was most intense. After our army severely hit the enemies, they defended near Nanshajiadu in Yicheng. In this campaign, our 某某 also suffered slight losses. Also, a unit of our ambushing戈兵溢 had an engagement with the enemies, killing many and capturing quite a few. On the 5th, we increased a unit to attack Tuanshan. The enemies were caught off guard, resisted slightly, and crashed into Jiulishan. Our army immediately took advantage of the situation to pursue and capture Xuan City and收收 Ting Mountain and Tuanshan, and a unit had advanced to Zhan Cun Wang Village to search and advance. (B) In the Qingyang area, our bridge once sent a powerful unit to attack the enemy in Dongrong. They encountered more than a hundred enemies in Yecun.

Guangdong Front

(A) Conghua front. On the morning of the 11th, more than 2,000 enemies, who were a combination of infantry and artillery, launched an invasion on our耶冈 position under the cover of aircraft from Taiping场Shangsan 抗大墩.

On the 12th, more than a thousand enemies were found near Mao'erling Jindong in southeast 某化, heading north, and旋 用砲击 to bombard our 某窝, 大 顶, and other positions to cover the infantry's attack, but in the end, they were unable to hide our strong military strength and were only虚张声势. At present, they are still confronting our army in Xiaoshidong,凤山, and other areas. (B) In the Sanshui area, our guerrillas have been very活 recently, and in order to consolidate their 후力 and prepare for future battles, the enemies did not hesitate to launch all their forces to掃荡, but the enemies are exhausted and are like a person running for their lives.

The enemies are extremely terrified, and they plan to build fortifications on both sides of the railway between Puqi and Yuezhou, attempting to cope with the dangerous situation. On the morning of the 13th, the enemies from Taolin, Yuezhou, launched an attack on our游 in the area east of Yuezhou. The fierce battle lasted for two hours. In order to maintain our韧强性 combat power, we automatically withdrew to a favorable place to defend, and took the opportunity to deal a blow to the enemies. (B) Liao west front. The戦事 line is quite沉沉. The enemies are now actively rushing to repair railways and highways. The 修 river north coast often bombards our Chen position on the south bank, attempting to contain and disrupt our army.

He strongly advocates the united anti-Japanese national front and opposes fascism, which is highly respected and trusted by the Indian people. His prestige has surpassed Gandhi, it is said.

### The Situation in the Northwest and How to Defend It

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Bai Yun (Continued)

Many people are quite worried that after the Yellow River freezes in winter, people will cross and invade Shaanxi. This is an overestimation. The Yellow River only freezes in winter in the upper reaches of Hequ County, and only the areas of northwestern Shanxi and southern Sui have this danger. Below Hequ, especially below Yumenkou, the current is rapid, and it rarely freezes. According to an old man in Tongsui, as far as he can remember, the Fenglingdu river froze only twice: once in the 17th year of Guangxu and once in the 18th year of the Republic. Vehicles and horses could travel on the ice, but both times there was heavy snowfall of two to three feet, and the climate was exceptionally cold. In ordinary cold weather, it will absolutely not freeze. Judging from this year's climate, it is even less likely to freeze. Currently, large ice floes are constantly sliding downstream, making it even more inconvenient for the enemy to cross secretly.

To defend the Northwest, the river defense of Guanzhong is naturally the most important. After crossing the river in southern Sui, the land is mostly sandy and difficult for the army to march. After crossing the river in northern Shaanxi and western Henan, there are many mountains, making marching even more difficult, so river defense is easier. Since the enemy's attack on the Northwest is focused on Xi'an, the river defense of Guanzhong is relatively important. This section of river defense includes Hancheng, Yangban, Chaoyi, Tongguan, and Chuxian. Among these places, the river defense around Pingmin and Tongguan is particularly important. The banks of the Han River in Hancheng are all cliffs. If well-trained artillery units and a considerable force are stationed there, it will be easier to defend. From Pingmin County to the Sanhekou near Tongguan, there are flat river beaches, reaching four or five li in width at the widest point. Moreover, Yongji County is occupied by the enemy, and the area around Tongguan, Pingmin County, and Chaoyi County is under enemy artillery control. If the enemy launches boats from Han Titown (south of Yongji) to cross the river, they can go downstream to land at Fumin Village in Pingmin County. After landing, a few miles northwest is Chaoyi County. If we cannot eliminate the enemy on the river beach, then Chaoyi and Dali cannot be defended. Dali is an important military town north of the Wei River within Tongguan. The enemy will surely attack Sanyuan and other places from the west, flanking the rear of Xi'an, to coordinate with the enemy's frontal attack on Tongguan from the Longhai Railway line to invade Xi'an. Therefore, the river defense in Guanzhong is most important in Pingmin. Tongguan has a strategic location, and it is not easy for the enemy to cross the river.

Recently, we have increased a large number of extremely elite troops, including mechanized units, to the river defense area of Hancheng and Tongguan. There are especially many troops stationed around Chaoyi. Heavy troops are stationed within a hundred li of the Yellow River. The water and land transportation connecting the Wei and Luo Rivers within Guanzhong has been completed. Thousands of civilians are constantly working on river defense projects under the command of the troops, so the river defense is extremely solid, and the rear can rest assured.

The government is actively preparing to defend the Northwest, not only increasing river defense forces but also reinforcing troops to Shanxi. What is hoped for from the rear is to take advantage of this period of lull in the war and intensify the mobilization of the people and all anti-Japanese preparations. Do not become complacent because of the temporary stability in the Northwest. Whether the war of resistance on the outer lines in the Northwest can be victorious and whether the river defense can be consolidated cannot rely solely on military affairs. We must integrate the entire Northwest's politics and popular mobilization, centered on Xi'an, and coordinate with military affairs to complete the task of defending the Northwest, so that there is a real guarantee.

7.  The Current Situation of Tongguan

If we can recover Yongji, then the enemy in the Fenglingdu and Han Tangzhen area will naturally be unable to gain a foothold, and Tongguan will naturally be stable. Otherwise, the Tongguan, Pingmin, and Chaoyi area will constantly be under the control of the enemy's artillery across the river. Even if the enemy does not cross the river, it will be difficult to stabilize. The Tongguan Longhai Railway transportation cannot be restored.

For months, the enemy in Fenglingdu has been shelling Tongguan from time to time. This is not an attempt to cross the river, but to disrupt our Longhai Railway transportation and destroy our Tongguan fortress. The purpose of disrupting the Longhai Railway transportation is to halt our east-west military transportation of reinforcements to southern Shanxi and supplies. There is an iron bridge in Shuiguan inside the south gate of Tongguan. The enemy artillery used this as a target and concentrated fire on it. Before it was broken, a shot was fired every ten seconds or so. The enemy expended one or two hundred shells to break this bridge, which was a considerable cost. After the bridge was broken, they prevented us from repairing it and continued to shell it from time to time. But we finally repaired the bridge using special methods, and the enemy's shelling lost its effectiveness. However, to prevent us from resuming traffic, they still shell it from time to time, day and night. Although our special transport rate can still pass, for the safety of passengers, passenger cars are divided into sections to operate inside and outside the pass. The middle section of several tens of li uses the highway for contact, which is quick, stable, and safe. Transportation is as usual, and the enemy's plan has been exhausted. Originally, our river defense also has elite artillery, and our artillery positions are higher than the enemy's artillery positions across the river, making it very easy to spot the enemy's artillery positions and eliminate them. But in order to save valuable artillery shells, we never fire without aim, and every shot must hit, destroying enemy artillery. In recent months, we have destroyed dozens of enemy guns. Now that the traffic on the Longhai Railway is no longer afraid of enemy shelling, we will let them fire day and night. Experts estimate that each unexploded shell fired by the enemy (made in Showa 13th year) is worth two or three hundred yuan. This kind of "self-destruction warfare" by the enemy is beneficial to us. Naturally, the more shelling, the better. The people in Tongguan city have been almost completely evacuated due to constant bombing by enemy aircraft and continuous shelling by mortars. Of the original residents and merchants, numbering over 25,000, only four or five hundred poor people who have no way to leave the city remain. Seven or eight out of ten houses have been bombed and collapsed. Except for the military and police agencies that continue to be stationed as usual, all other agencies have moved to other locations to work. Therefore, Tongguan has now become a purely military fortress, and the defense has become more solid. The enemy's conspiracy to shake our military and civilians has no effect. I hope that our people will absolutely not be worried by the constant shelling sounds in Tongguan. That is exactly the same as the enemy's alarm bell urging us to intensify the war of resistance. The people in the four townships of Tongguan are intensifying mobilization under the sound of this alarm bell every day. The river defense teams formed by able-bodied men assist the troops in defending the river day and night. The rear should be calm. (January 8th, in Xi'an)

### The League of Nations Administrative Council Accepts the Resolution to Aid China, Requests That Relevant Countries Examine Our Demands, Representative Gu Reserves the Right to Re-appeal

[Reuters, Geneva, 20th] Today, the League of Nations Administrative Council unanimously adopted the Chinese famine case and reiterated the various recognitions taken by the League of Nations in the past, such as the League of Nations General Assembly resolution passed on October 6, 1937, the Administrative Council resolutions passed on February 2 and May 14, 1938, and the Administrative Council report of September 30, 1938. Today's resolution also stated, "The League of Nations Administrative Council has listened to the report of the Chinese representative. In that report, the Chinese representative refused to accept Japan's demand to build a new order in East Asia, and at the same time summarized several recommendations of the Chinese government. The Administrative Council also found that several member states have already taken individual actions to aid China. It is now invited that each member state, especially those with direct relations with the Far East, and other countries with the same relations, consult with each other to examine the recommendations made by the Chinese representative in the Administrative Council on January 17, 1939. This recommendation is to take effective measures to assist China." Dr. Gu Weijun said, "I will vote in favor of adopting this resolution. Judging from my statement to the Administrative Council on Tuesday, this resolution clearly failed to satisfy the Chinese government. But the reason why I am still willing to accept it is because I want a unanimous agreement. Only this is the case. I am willing to abide by government instructions and declare here that although I accept the resolution, I still make a reservation, that is, the Administrative Council recognizes that the Chinese government has the intention to re-appeal."

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 20th] The League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting last night at 9 o'clock and adjourned at 10:30. It formally passed the recommendations on the China and Spain issues. The Administrative Council can formally pass these two cases at a public meeting this afternoon. The representatives attending the meeting refused to announce the detailed content of the resolution, only saying that the representatives had universally expressed agreement with the two cases.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 20th] According to representatives attending last night's closed-door meeting of the Administrative Council, the draft resolution on the China issue is very long, suggesting that member states consider the various demands stated in the speech of the Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Gu Weijun, and consider holding consultations with non-member states such as the United States. Dr. Gu Weijun made a statement to reporters after the meeting adjourned, saying that he was deeply disappointed with this resolution and that China would continue to appeal to the Administrative Council.

[Reuters, Geneva, 19th] Although the Chinese representative Gu Weijun and the Spanish representative Taldi Yu actively requested assistance at the closed-door meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council yesterday, there was no practical solution to the issues of China and Spain in the meeting. It is reported that the Spanish representative requested to form a committee of representatives from six countries, including Spain, the Soviet Union, France, the United States, Belgium, and Sweden, to punish the dictatorships, but the result of the meeting was only to submit a non-substantial bill on the public bombing of cities to the closed-door meeting tonight for discussion, and then submit it to the public conference tomorrow. When six countries, including Latvia, Yugoslavia, the United States, China, and the Soviet Union, held a closed-door meeting, the Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun requested sanctions against Japan, but no agreement was reached. The League of Nations Administrative Council will discuss it again tonight. It is reported that the Administrative Council does not approve of China immediately forcing its petition to the League of Nations to succeed, because it is better to wait for the results of the diplomatic notes sent to Japan by the three countries of Britain, the United States, and France before making a decision.

[Associated Press, Geneva, 19th] Spanish Foreign Minister Talfa Yu addressed the public meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, saying that the air raids in Spain were initiated by Germans and Italians, and "Italian newspapers not only described this bombing behavior but also openly took pride in it. I know that Spaniards must not want to bomb Spain. It must have been instigated by Germans and Italians."

Germany Aiding Italy's Invasion of French Territory; Gains Freedom of Action in Spain

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Political commentary authority Madame Tabouis wrote in the Labor News today that Hitler and Mussolini have reached a compromise on the Mediterranean and Spanish issues. The author said she learned from a Rome source that Germany assisted Italy's requests to obtain Djibo, Tunisia, and disarm Corsica. Hitler believed that this would make Italy's position in the Mediterranean more superior. In order to repay Germany's assistance, Mussolini had to reluctantly allow Germany to have freedom of action in Spain. In exchange, the author also stated that in order to adapt to its rights, Germany will soon supply the Spanish rebels with a large number of heavy artillery, aircraft technology, and talent.

[Reuters, Burgos, Upper, 9th] The Battle of Igualada has begun today. This place is the gateway to Barcelona and is only thirty-three miles from the Catalan capital. In the evening, Franco's troops arrived at the foot of the mountain, about three miles from their target. The rebel artillery bombarded the surrounding roads all day long. The light artillery teams loaded by mule trains advanced along the eastern slopes of Queralt. After the rebel artillery arrived at their positions, they bombarded Igualada. Rebel aircraft bombed the government army's front lines and strafed them with machine guns, then returned to the rear, and the artillery bombarded again. At the same time, the rebels used a thousand trucks to transport infantry from Monmenc and Aguilo to the front lines, preparing to attack as soon as the tanks and armored vehicles cleared the obstacles. At noon today, the main force of the rebels had advanced three miles into the steep mountain valley. Their front line has approached Pontons. If they occupy the town, the main force of the rebels will rush into the transportation network between Igualada and Vilafranca. It is said that the Ugg 1st Division is descending from Pens to Silide, and the Mastralasgos is speeding along the Lerida and Barcelona highway to the north of the village, and has crossed Montefalco. Tonight, the rebel headquarters reported that "our army is progressing rapidly."

Lloyd George and the Labor Party Request a Halt to the Ban on Arms Shipments to Spain

[Associated Press, Wales, 19th] Former British Prime Minister Lloyd George, together with members of the Labor Party, unanimously demanded that the government stop the decree banning the shipment of arms to Spain and condemned those "in high positions" for not allowing Spain to become an outer court of various dictators. "Looking at the history of our England, our relationship with Spain has never been as special as it is today, and Spain is the key to our commercial lines. Our government is publicly elected by the people, and the dictators have actually taken this key from the hands of our government. They allow this key to be returned to our country after the democratic government is driven out of Spain. Is it not ridiculous, and some people in high positions actually believe it? Every time the dictators break their promises, they declare an even deeper belief in them. Is it not strange?

[Reuters, London, 19th] The National Labor Congress, representing the Labor Party, the Trade Union Federation, and the Parliamentary Labor Party, sent a letter to Chamberlain, requesting that measures be taken immediately to stop the policy of non-interference in the Spanish war, and said, "According to international law, the Spanish government originally had the right to purchase arms, but the democratic countries have never been willing to recognize this. On the contrary, the dictatorships are still continuing to assist the Spanish rebels, resulting in a one-sided benefit for the fascist traitors."

### Soviet-Polish Trade Promotion; Polish Delegation Arrives in Moscow to Discuss Concrete Measures

[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] A Polish delegation of thirteen people arrived here today to conduct trade talks with the Soviet Union. This is another step forward in the reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Poland. The country is composed of representatives from the Polish government and business circles, led by Polish Minister of Economy Dr. Ricker Dasgi. Concrete measures to promote trade between the two countries have begun to be discussed. It is noted that in 1938, the trade value between the two countries reached a total of 200,000, and in 1939, it will be expanded to more than 1 million pounds.

German Foreign Minister and Air Minister Will Also Visit Poland

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 20th] According to the official announcement here yesterday, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will visit Warsaw from Berlin on the 25th of this month and return to the country on the 27th. According to the National Socialist Party's newspaper, the Kogneo, German Air Minister General Goering will follow German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to Warsaw, because he intends to participate in the hunting meeting in Kota Lu City Forest in mid-February. At that time, he will meet with many Polish political figures. According to semi-official sources, the Duke of Koburg will visit Poland on the 26th of this month, and will stay in Warsaw for three days in his capacity as the president of the International Military Veterans Association to participate in the grand ceremony celebrating the fifth anniversary of the signing of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact.

### Hitler to Deliver a Long Speech, Reporting on Domestic Issues, Hinting at Future Policies

[Reuters, Berlin, 20th] It is reported that Hitler will deliver a long speech at the German National Assembly on January 30, but there is no official report on this. The content of the speech is mostly about domestic consumer issues, while describing major events of the past year and hinting at future policies.

### U.S. Silver Purchase Procedure Amendment Bill; Pittman Introduced It the Day Before Yesterday, Advocating Domestic and Foreign Silver

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] U.S. Senator Pittman introduced a silver purchase procedure amendment bill today, advocating the purchase of both domestic and foreign silver. However, silver must be purchased with U.S. export goods. One-quarter of the reserve for the bill is silver, and three-quarters is gold. From July 1 of this year, the domestic silver price will be set at $1.29 per ounce. The bill will reduce the tax on silver trade profits by 50%.

### Gandhi Writes an Article Condemning Hitler, Calling Him a Madman Surpassing Ancient Tyrants, Advocating Religious Resistance by Jews

[Reuters, London, 19th] Indian leader Gandhi wrote an article in the "Church of England Newspaper": "Palestine belongs to the Arabs, and England belongs to the English. Their meaning is the same. To make the Arabs suffer at the hands of the Jews is inhumane." He pointed out that he did not want to maintain the Arab's excessive actions. He mentioned the Jewish people's demand to return to their homeland and questioned, "Since they grew up here, why can't they take this place as their homeland like other people?" He mentioned the atrocities against the German people and said, "The ancient tyrants are still not as crazy as Hitler's actions." He mentioned the German Onintai and said, "I believe that if there are knowledgeable people among them who come out to lead non-violent actions, then their winter's disappointment will be transformed into summer's hope in an instant. The situation of being trafficked today can easily be transformed into a definite force. This is what unarmed men and women with the power to endure hardship can do. Resisting the crazy behavior that destroys human nature and has no God is the true religious resistance."

### Hitler Meets with the Soviet Ambassador, Causing Bizarre Rumors; Moscow's Official Newspaper Claims That the Communist Party's Policy Will Not Change

[Associated Press, Moscow, 20th] Hitler's meeting with Soviet Ambassador to Germany, Mo Zhanlov, has caused bizarre rumors from all sides. Some people even say that after the end of the war in the west, Germany and Russia will reconcile. However, according to the official Moscow newspaper, Baishi Opinion, this is completely unfounded and ridiculous. Especially Germany has no need for the Soviet Union except for raw materials, but raw materials can also be obtained from other places. The Soviet Union has no need for Germany either. Even if it wants German assistance in technology, it is not possible due to political institutions. The Communist Party has never suddenly changed its policies. Anti-fascism is forever deeply hated by the Soviet Union, it is said.

### German New Cruiser Launched; British Shallow-Draft Gunboat in the Yangtze River, the Second Grasshopper Also Launched

[Central News Agency, Bremen, Germany, 19th] Germany's newly built K-class cruiser, now named "Ase Benlizi," was launched this afternoon under the auspices of Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder.

[Reuters, London, 19th] The British government built two shallow-draft gunboats for the Yangtze River Fleet. The second one, the "Grasshopper," was launched this morning in Saunsetta. The presiding officer was the wife of Mr. Erle, the former chargé d'affaires in China. The "Grasshopper" has a displacement of 585 tons. Its military equipment has been greatly improved and includes several four-inch guns and a crew of 74 people.

### U.S. Naval Expansion Plan; Government Has Submitted It to Congress; Denies Approval of Fortifications in Guam

[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] The U.S. government has submitted a naval expansion plan to Congress, requesting permission for the government to build or improve naval bases in important military areas. Reporters from this agency have received reports that the naval plan also includes granting the Philippines immediate and unconditional independence. Therefore, the opposition voices in Congress are unfolding. Those who oppose the fortification of Guam claim that if this movement in Congress is approved, there will be substantial changes in the plan to fortify Guam. The chairman of the Naval Committee, Vincent, also said that the so-called approval of the fortification of Guam only approves the construction of several critical projects, including the fortification of Guam. The naval plan submitted this time gives the Navy Department comprehensive powers to choose the most suitable plan for fortification or improvement. A Zheng army statement also said that the case has not been approved by the White House but has been approved by the Budget Bureau.

[Associated Press, Washington, 19th] President Roosevelt denied that he had approved an appropriation of $5 million to immediately build a first-class naval base in Guam. This matter was mentioned by Admiral Hepburn in his newly drafted report. According to White House personnel, the government's attitude can generally be represented by Lippmann's article in today's "Pioneer Forum." The article says, "This matter must be considered with the most calm mind."

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] U.S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Marshall, said while attending the Military Committee of the House of Representatives today that the United States' ability to defend against air raids is weaker than that of other countries. The coming war will begin in the air. Therefore, the United States still needs nineteen mobile defense camps to provide adequate ground defense.

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] It is said that a plan to provide 100 million tons of coal for industrial use for application in wartime emergencies has been submitted to the planning group of the military department for review. The amount of coal will be stored in underwater canals near the industrial area for the national defense work of the United States.

### Romanian Political Situation (Continued)

In early April of this year, the Iron Guard, using weapons supplied by Berlin, plotted a rebellion in Bucharest. The plot was discovered by the government due to a lack of secrecy. As a result, Codreanu was arrested, and his accomplice, General Antonescu, was exiled. Documents seized proved that they intended to eliminate all opposition after the coup. King Carol was not vigilant about this case. Later, the Iron Guard automatically announced its dissolution. The authorities did not deeply investigate the ringleaders, and Carol wanted to compromise with them and incorporate the group for his own use. Therefore, there are still many members of the Iron Guard in the government, such as the minority minister Tătărăscu and the propaganda minister Te Ieșanu. After this incident, Carol also took the opportunity to eliminate dissidents and seal up many political parties.

One. The National Peasant Party

The National Peasant Party is the largest bourgeois democratic party in Romania. It has some mass base among peasants and the lower and middle classes in cities. They advocate upholding the constitution, uniting with Britain, France, and the Balkan countries, and opposing the German-Italian axis. The leader is Maniu. Before the parliamentary re-election in November 1937, the Communist Party, seeing the rampant fascist reactionary forces, proposed to domestic democratic parties to form a united anti-fascist front. As a result, the bourgeois parties stubbornly adhered to their prejudices and refused to unite. Maniu politely agreed with the Iron Guard on three points, promising not to infringe upon each other. The result was a disastrous defeat. Later, after the Goga cabinet stepped down, they realized the need to organize a democratic united front to confront the fascists. However, King Carol had already decided to implement a monarchical dictatorship. Even all constitutional forms were abolished, and political party activities were banned. The rights stipulated in the constitution have been fundamentally overthrown.

Two. Other Political Parties

On the right wing, there are also the (1) National Liberal Party, led by Tătărescu. It had considerable influence when Tătărescu was in power; (2) the German Party, led by Himmler's henchman Fomberling; (3) the Romanian Front, led by Voiculescu; and (4) the Christian National Party, led by Goga and Cuza.

On the left wing, there are the (1) United Socialist Party, led by Ghelerter. Many members are Trotskyists; (2) the Radical Peasant Party, led by Lupu; (3) the Social Democratic Party; and (4) the Communist Party.

(Four) Domestic Ethnic Conflicts

One. The Issue of Ethnic Minorities

The ethnicities in Europe are inherently complex. Fifteen countries have so-called ethnic minorities. The total population is around 30 million. Narrow nationalism cannot resolve this issue. Some say this is the evil created by the Treaty of Versailles. In fact, this is not entirely true. Before the war, the total population of ethnic minorities under foreign rule was even greater, around 100 million. It has been greatly reduced after the war. However, it has not been fundamentally resolved. Currently, Poland has the most ethnic minorities. The total population is over 8 million. The second is Czechoslovakia, with over 4 million people. If the 4 million Catalans and 1 million Basques in Spain are also considered ethnic minorities, Spain ranks second. Yugoslavia rules over more than 2 million ethnic minorities, including Germans, Magyars, Romanians, and Albanians. Italy has over 1 million, and Latvia has 500,000. Hungary has about 800,000. The total population of ethnic minorities in Romania is over 4 million, including Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, Jews, Poles, Gagauzians, Bulgarians, and Yugoslavs. After the war, she acquired a lot of territory from the Austro-Hungarian Empire: (1) Transylvania and (2) Bukovina. However, Romanians only account for 59% of the population in the former and 34% in the latter.

### Anglo-American Alliance Can Ensure World Peace; Singapore's Important Position in the Far East; McNair's Impressions After Inspection

[United Press, Singapore, 20th] McNair, while traveling to Manila on the Empress of Asia mail ship, told reporters that the fortress of Singapore, based on his impressions after inspecting its fortifications, will occupy an extremely important position in the Far East in the future. Singapore symbolizes British strength in the Far East, and its naval base has unlimited conveniences. Regarding whether the United States has a similar naval base for the US Asian Fleet to utilize, McNair declined to comment, but said that the union of Britain and the United States is the most reliable guarantee for clarifying the world.

### US Department of Agriculture Proposes Cotton Industry Meeting; Aims for Cooperation Between All Countries and the United States

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] According to officials from the Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Secretary Wallace's proposal to convene an international cotton industry conference is actually hinting to major cotton-producing countries to cooperate with the United States; otherwise, the United States may find ways to enable its exporters to cope with the price of foreign cotton. The United States may also imitate the method of subsidizing the flour industry by subsidizing cotton exporters or lending them money to lower the price of US cotton and facilitate sales. According to general opinion, the current loan proposed by the US government for the International Flour Conference is greatly related to flour industry subsidies, so cotton industry subsidies in the future may have the same effect.

### Jamaican Sugar Merchants Cable British Colonial Office; Request Increased Sugar Production

[Reuters, London, 19th] Sugar merchants from Jamaica (the largest of the British West Indies islands in the Greater Antilles, east of Cuba) recently cabled the British Colonial Office, expressing their concern upon hearing that Colonial Secretary MacDonald stated that sugar production quotas could not be increased. They stated that sugar production must be increased because unemployment is increasing daily, and the situation is extremely serious.

### Japanese Intrude and Steal Lumber; Philippine Soldiers Angrily Open Fire; One Wounded and Taken to Manila; Luzon Requests Increased Troops for Protection

[Reuters, Manila, 20th] Yesterday afternoon, a sudden incident between Japanese and Filipino people occurred in a certain area of Luzon Island. It was discovered that 26 Japanese people from Taiwan intended to steal lumber. Philippine soldiers discovered this and opened fire, wounding and arresting one Japanese person. The remaining Japanese people fled back to the ship they arrived on. The arrested suspect has been taken back to Manila for investigation and prosecution. Furthermore, it is reported that Japanese fishing boats have repeatedly intruded into Philippine territorial waters and illegally fished in restricted areas over the past few months. Therefore, the authorities are quite angry about this. At the same time, Luzon has requested increased troops for protection.

Brief Commentary

### Leadership by Local Gentry

Chairman Chiang sent a telegram on the 19th to local gentry and educators across the country, hoping that they would take the lead in promoting conscription and developing the local economy in their respective hometowns, to supplement the inadequacies of government orders and expedite the success of these endeavors. The entire text is earnest and clearly explains the intentions. All those who love their hometowns and motherland, upon reading it, should be eager to participate. All those who are unwilling to let their fields and homes be ravaged by invaders should resolutely follow the advice, lead their younger brothers, become national pillars, and contribute their wealth to assist in construction. Moreover, the local gentry are best suited to disseminate government policies and laws and express the hardships and demands of the people between the government and the masses. "Leadership by the local gentry" is also relevant here. It should also be noted that (1) leadership by the local gentry is not compatible with feudal customs and conservative thinking. Therefore, the phrases "lead by example" and "promote public opinion" mentioned in Chairman Chiang's telegram cannot be taken lightly. All outdated customs, conservative thinking, and sectarian prejudices should be strongly rejected. (2) Leadership is not compatible with monopolization. Therefore, local gentry should particularly understand the profound meaning of Chairman Chiang's telegram: "Only by making the best use of everyone's talents and abilities can we achieve the success of many hands making light work." Those who have prestige among the people and have experience in mobilizing the people and specialized skills must be vigorously supported for national use, regardless of factions or prejudices. Only then can we live up to the earnest intentions of the highest leader.

### Guerrilla Cadre Training Class

It is reported that the central authorities have decided to first establish a guerrilla cadre training class somewhere, with Tang Enbo and Ye Jianying responsible for presiding over it, in order to expand the results of guerrilla warfare. This shows that the anti-Japanese guideline of "guerrilla warfare being more important than positional warfare" in the second phase of the war will be gradually implemented. At present, the situation in the Northwest battlefield may become increasingly serious, and the war in the Southwest has become more intense. However, the guerrilla warfare that we rely on to win the second phase of the war has not yet been widely developed. The lack of cadres is also an important reason. Now that Generals Tang and Ye, who are known for their prestige and experience, have taken the lead in training cadres, it is firmly believed that it will greatly benefit the war of resistance. However, judging from the current situation, this type of cadre training should be expanded to a national scale to meet the urgent needs of various war zones. In addition, in the Northwest, there were originally such cadre training schools, but due to various reasons, the trained cadres could not go to various places to serve the country, and the youth who went to study were often obstructed or arrested. It is hoped that this phenomenon will no longer exist after this Fifth Plenary Session.

### The Process of the Shanghai Customs Being Dealt With

— (Special Correspondence from Shanghai by this Newspaper) Zhi Ping

The Beginning of Negotiations

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle on August 13, Japanese ships entering and exiting the Yangshupu and Hongkou districts have relied on their military force to refuse customs inspection. At the same time, Japanese goods have taken advantage of their tax-free convenience to be dumped in large quantities in the Shanghai market. After our army withdrew westward, unscrupulous merchants colluded with Japanese merchants, and the import of smuggled goods became even more rampant. In the first four months of the 27th year, according to Japanese reports, the liaison ships from Japan to Shanghai totaled 13 times. Other ships totaled 15 times, carrying a total of more than 54,000 tons of goods. Major smuggled goods included rayon, sugar, piece goods, soybeans, soybean oil, cigarette paper, and seafood. The impact on the customs' revenue was enormous.

Before the war, the Shanghai customs revenue ranked first in the country, reaching 20 million yuan per month at its peak. At this time, it had dropped to about 4 million yuan per month. The bondholders of various foreign debts guaranteed by customs revenue naturally became uneasy. The Japanese then used the restoration of customs rights as bait to entice the British to negotiate with them, threatening Shanghai Customs to accept the new tax rates set by the puppet organization.

The negotiations began as early as February of the 27th year, with the British ambassador to Japan negotiating with the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. Initially, there was deep concern that the outside world would learn of it. By the time the negotiations ended in May, it was announced that the new tax rate would be officially implemented from June 1st. Thus, this play ××××××××× was completed.

The Content of the Agreement

On May 3, the British and Japanese sides simultaneously published a communique on the Shanghai Customs negotiations. The text was very brief, only stipulating that after deducting the principal and interest of foreign debts, the remaining Shanghai customs revenue would be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. Other details were not mentioned. What was actually manifested after the agreement was established was that the Nanjing organization actually appointed a puppet official as the Shanghai Customs Superintendent. Although smuggling work in the Shanghai East District Customs resumed, the customs officers assigned were limited to Japanese or Western personnel. What is particularly noteworthy is that the implementation of the new tax rules eliminated the customs surtax, and an additional 5% disaster relief surtax was levied. The imported goods with reduced taxes included cotton cloth, cotton yarn, cotton, cotton textiles, wool textiles, rayon, seafood, sugar, gasoline, cement, and miscellaneous goods, which were more beneficial to the import of Japanese goods. In addition, among the exported goods, cotton and mineral products, which are raw materials for manufacturing munitions, were completely exempt from tax.

The original text of the communique issued by the British and Japanese on the Shanghai Customs negotiations is as follows:

"Beginning in February of this year (1938), the British Ambassador to Japan and the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs conducted informal negotiations regarding the repayment of foreign debts guaranteed by Chinese customs revenues and other related matters. As a result of the exchange of views, the Japanese government notified the British government of its proposed temporary measures for adjusting this matter during wartime. The British government stated in its reply to Japan that Britain did not oppose the implementation of these temporary wartime measures and heard that the United States and France also did not intend to raise any objections. If there is a sudden change in the economic situation, these measures may be reconsidered. All tax revenues collected by customs at various ports in the Japanese-occupied areas will be deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. From these deposits, the foreign debt repayments shall be issued to the Inspector General of Customs to fully fulfill the obligations of foreign debts and reparations guaranteed by customs revenues. The payment of these foreign debts and reparations shall be the first expenditure after deducting customs administrative expenses and certain customs payments and subsidies. The amount of foreign debt payable at each port shall be determined each month according to the percentage of the total customs revenue of all ports in the previous month. The Boxer Indemnity funds due to Japan, which have been deposited in HSBC since last September, will be paid to the Japanese government. In addition, arrangements will be made to fulfill Japan's share of the future payments of the Boxer Indemnity and the 1913 Reorganization Loan, and to reimburse the Shanghai overdraft under the Shanghai foreign debt payment account accumulated by the Inspector General of Customs in HSBC since February of this year, and to transfer the surplus of customs duties in HSBC under the Japanese-occupied ports to the Yokohama Specie Bank for future payment of foreign debts.

Reactions from All Parties

One. Chinese Customs Staff Once Went on Strike. After hearing that the puppet organization appointed a member as the Customs Superintendent, all the Chinese staff of Shanghai Customs were indignant. On the morning of May 7, they went on strike and held a plenary meeting, resolving five points: (1) Request that the Customs Commissioner, Mr. ロフォード, and the Chinese Deputy Customs Commissioner, Mr. Qiū Qíwěi, come to the scene to explain the situation. (2) Elect representatives to establish the Shanghai Customs Chinese Staff Protection Association, with the aim of protecting the integrity of customs sovereignty. (3) Elect 35 executive committee members to form an executive committee. (4) Telegraph the central government to explain the current environment and the situation at sea, and request Minister Kong to clarify the methods. (5) Resolutely implement the strike before obtaining practical methods.

After the five resolutions were passed, senior customs officials believed that the situation was serious, so they attended to give instructions, trying their best to persuade them, believing that the customs was a government agency and had a significant relationship with shipping companies. The staff serving in the customs must not rush to leave their posts without receiving government orders. Moreover, various rumors are not true. They should not take any action to avoid affecting all parties and being taken advantage of by others.

During the wave, there was also an incident of customs officers being kidnapped, which was resolved through negotiations. There were also transfers to the Guangdong Customs. The wave then subsided.

Two. Our Government's Protest. After the news of the Shanghai Customs negotiation agreement was released, our ambassador to the United Kingdom first raised two points to the British government in opposition: (1) Britain recognizes Japan's control over the customs duties of the eight ports in North China. (2) The agreement contains provisions for repaying domestic debts. After the agreement communique was published, our government sent a note to the British Foreign Office, stating that China would never be bound by the measures agreed upon by Britain and Japan, and reserved China's complete right and freedom of action on its customs matters. It also denounced the actions of two foreign countries concluding an agreement on Chinese customs without China's consent. (To be continued)

### Qiongya Chamber of Commerce Welcomes Representatives from Various Regions Yesterday; Discussing Major Plans for Saving and Building Qiong; Seeking to Concentrate the Strength of Qiong Overseas Chinese to Assist the Government in Urgently Rescuing Their Hometown; A Total of 32 Proposals from Various Representatives, All of Which Are Urgent

Qiong overseas Chinese from various regions, in order to concentrate their strength and assist the government in saving the country and their hometown, recently convened a representative conference in Hong Kong. Details of the conference have already been reported. The first meeting was originally scheduled for yesterday, but the Qiongya Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, as representatives had not yet arrived, has postponed the date of the conference for several days. At the same time, in order to fulfill its duties as the host, it held a welcome reception at 2:30 PM yesterday. Attendees included Qiongya Garrison Commander Yang Yongren, Overseas Chinese Affairs Director Xu Tianshen, Qiongshan County Magistrate Yun Zhenzhong, and overseas Qiong overseas Chinese representatives and fellow villagers in Hong Kong, totaling more than 100 people. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. Chairman Zhou Wenzhi led the proceedings as usual and delivered a welcome speech expressing his welcome.

Motivation for the Convocation: Saving the Hometown and Saving the Country

He then reported on the motivation for convening this general representative conference, stating that many Qiongya fellow villagers have engaged in business overseas, and many guild halls or associations have been established in various places, but there is no established overall general organization. Therefore, communication between various places is very difficult. In this period of national crisis, for the sake of the motherland and the sake of their hometown, they should establish it as soon as possible. People can pool their efforts to save the country and their hometown. This time, the Haikou fellow villagers discussed this matter, and obtained the approval of senior hometown elders Minister Song (Ziwen), Commander Chen (Ce), and local officials. They jointly initiated the invitation of overseas hometown Qiong overseas Chinese to send representatives to Hong Kong to discuss organizing the "Overseas Qiong Overseas Chinese United General Association." As for the purpose of establishing the association, it is to connect the Qiong overseas Chinese from various ports, so that they can take consistent steps in future affairs related to the country, hometown, and all public undertakings, in order to achieve the effect of pooling efforts. Currently, during the national crisis, we the people should bear the responsibility and obligation of saving the country and our hometown, as well as the relief work for Qiong overseas Chinese and hometown relatives who are unemployed and displaced. Further speaking, our Qiongya hometown has always been known as a national treasure trove, such as forests and mineral resources. Most of the wealth remains untapped. Considering the reason, it is the lack of communication. Therefore, we hope that this general association can be realized as soon as possible. Moreover, our hometown Qiong overseas Chinese love the country and are unwilling to lag behind others, and they should love their hometown even more. They should contribute their personal views to the government and assist the government in improving politics and eliminating corruption in their hometown. Without a group organization, individual actions will make it difficult to convey the lower situation to the higher authorities. The leaders in their hometowns also deeply hope that overseas Qiong overseas Chinese organizations can be established as soon as possible to promote the aspirations of the Qiong overseas Chinese. Zhou finally stated that initiators Minister Song and Commander Chen were unable to attend due to attending the Fifth Plenary Session for military celebrations, and asked for their forgiveness.

Protecting Qiong, We Should Seek Self-Reliance

Next, Guo Juchuan, the representative of the Qiongzhou Association Federation of British Malaya, replied, hoping that his fellow villagers in Hong Kong would give him more advice and discuss major plans for saving the hometown and saving the country. Then, Qiongya Garrison Commander Yang Yongren stood up and gave a speech, stating that in this severe military environment, the position of Qiong is also dangerous. In the past, people always thought that the gains and losses of Hainan Island were enough to affect international relations, so they could temporarily feel at ease. At the same time, people also had this speculation about Guangzhou, but Guangzhou has now fallen. From this point of view, the word "international" is not reliable. We should rely on our own efforts to regenerate ourselves. The government has now decided to use every minute of time and every ounce of strength to be fully responsible for protecting the homeland. However, the current war cannot completely rely on the army. He hopes for the assistance of all the people of Qiong and hopes that the association will be established as soon as possible and will not hesitate to give advice to the authorities, point out errors, and provide opinions to improve. The authorities should adopt them as much as possible. After that, representatives from various places spoke one after another, and the meeting was dismissed at 5 o'clock. As for the date of the general assembly, it has not yet been decided. According to the chairman, a preparatory meeting will first be held during the day to review the proposals in groups.

32 Proposals, All Extremely Important

In addition, there were a total of 32 proposals from representatives from various places at the representative conference, all of which are practical and needed. They are listed below: (1) The Director of the Qiongya Haikou Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau should be nominated by the Qiongya Overseas Chinese General Association. (2) Petitioning the government to actively train strong men to strengthen self-defense and anti-Japanese forces. (3) Restoring the Haikou Shuichang Pier to facilitate travel.

### United States' Giant Boeing Clipper Aircraft; Two More Aircraft Will Be Assigned to Fly Between Hong Kong and the United States; Trial Flight from the United States to Hong Kong in Early Next Month

United Air Lines previously ordered six giant Boeing Clipper aircraft in order to develop its business, and in the future, this type of giant aircraft will also fly between Hong Kong and the United States. This matter has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is reported that the most recently completed aircraft will be on a trial flight from the United States to Hong Kong in early next month, carrying only mail and cargo, not passengers. The second completed aircraft will be received by the company a few days later, and the third aircraft will also be completed next month. Because the company's transatlantic flights will not begin until May, the second and third aircraft will also be temporarily transferred to fly the weekly flights between Hong Kong and the United States. If this becomes a reality, there will be three such giant aircraft in Hong Kong. Furthermore, the headquarters of United Air Lines, which has been located in Alameda, is now being relocated to Treasure Island, the site of the World's Fair. After the meeting is completed, the entire island will be permanently prepared for seaplanes and ordinary airports.

### Apparent Lifeboat Unloading Cargo – Four Coolies Fall into Hold, Severely Injured – Crane Cable Snaps, Plunging with Cargo – Head, Hands, and Internal Injuries All Severe, Lives Feared

The Jardine Matheson Steamship Company's "Manifest Destiny" steamer, which travels between Sandakan and Hong Kong, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday, the 15th, and docked at buoy number 23. After unloading the cargo bound for Hong Kong, it is scheduled to depart for Sandakan today (the 21st). Therefore, various Hong Kong merchants wishing to ship goods to Sandakan via this vessel loaded their cargo onto lighters yesterday and transported it to the ship.  While unloading cargo was in full swing yesterday morning, the cable of the crane on the second deck of the ship suddenly snapped, causing four coolies to fall into the hold, suffering severe injuries. The injured included coolies Li Tai (47 years old), Li Bo (40 years old), Li Luo (24 years old), and Tao Bao (50 years old), who were hired to unload cargo. At the time, the four coolies were standing on the second deck, using the crane to lower cargo from the ship's deck to the bottom hold. Because the cargo was unusually heavy, the crane's cable was unable to bear the weight. When it reached the third level, with a snapping sound, the cable broke in the middle, and the cargo fell to the bottom of the hold. The four coolies, affected by the force of the impact, lost their footing and fell to the bottom as well. Because there were many boxed goods at the bottom of the hold, and the distance between the bottom of the hold and the deck was several yards, when the four coolies fell to the bottom, their heads and hands made contact with the boxed goods, resulting in severe injuries to their heads, hands, feet, and internal organs. They lay in a severely injured state at the bottom of the hold, gasping for breath, with fresh blood flowing from their wounds. People on the ship, seeing the crane break and the four coolies seriously injured, immediately informed the ship's owner, raised the police flag, and had people go down into the hold to carry the four injured men to the deck, first administering some medicine to stop the bleeding. Before long, a naval police boat noticed the ship flying the police flag and approached the ship. The water police boarded the ship and inquired, learning the above situation. They then carried the four injured men onto the water police boat and sailed to Blake Pier, telegraphing the Central Fire Brigade Bureau to dispatch ambulances to the scene. The four injured men were carried to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. However, because the injuries were so severe, even after the doctors treated them, they remained unconscious, and their lives were feared to be in danger.

### Our Country's Famous Painter, Wang Jiyuan, Passed Through Hong Kong Yesterday to Go to Malaya – Continuing to Promote National Culture and Raise Funds for Refugees – Letter Sent to Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Chairman Requesting Investigation of Slanderous Rumors

(Special Report from Our Newspaper) The famous painter Mr. Wang Jiyuan, since the start of the War of Resistance, has gone to the Nanyang region to engage in official propaganda. Yesterday, he again passed through Hong Kong on the British ship "Cathay." A reporter met him at the wharf. According to him, this trip to Malaya is still to promote national culture, inspire patriotism among overseas Chinese, and he will then make another trip, staying for about three or four months before returning to the country. He also showed a recent letter to Chairman Chen Shuren of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, which is transcribed as follows: "Since the start of the War of Resistance, Jiyuan has held the position of advocating for national salvation from my place and am diligently striving to do my best in production and promotion, even traveling far across the oceans. Although it has been difficult, I have not dared to slack off. Counting from February of the 27th year [1938], I went to the Philippines, and in March I sold my works, donating half of the proceeds, 700 yuan, to the Bank of China in Hong Kong to be transferred to Mr. Du Yuesheng to help Shanghai refugees. In April, I held a solo exhibition in Singapore, selling works and donating half of the proceeds, 200-odd dollars, directly to the Singapore China Relief Committee. In the same month, I held a solo exhibition in Kuala Lumpur, selling works and still donating half of the proceeds, 390-odd dollars – equivalent to over 700 national dollars – directly to the Selangor Relief Committee. In May, I returned to the country and created over a hundred ink paintings and wrote about war zone relics. In August, I went to the west, and in September I went to Quanzhou, donating fifty pieces of calligraphy and paintings to the Penang China Relief Committee, with a value of over 1,000 dollars. In mid-October, I went to Kuala Lumpur again, donating fifty pieces of calligraphy and paintings to the Selangor China Relief Committee, with a value of over 1,400 Straits dollars. After the fall of Guangzhou, I donated twenty-five recent works to the Selangor Cantonese Overseas Chinese Relief Committee, with a value of over 1,000 Straits dollars. Wherever I have gone, I have promoted national culture and inspired overseas Chinese in various places to continue to exert their patriotic strength. Making a living through art, I also take care of refugees. These are all facts. Unexpectedly, recently, villains have spread rumors, starting from Hankou and then Hong Kong, claiming that I embezzled a huge sum of 40,000 yuan in relief funds. Catching shadows and grasping the wind, it is naturally laughed at by those who know the truth. However, because the rumor-mongers are from the rear, it is clear that there is another purpose, what is being sabotaged. Jiyuan really cannot remain silent, so I dare to straightforwardly report this, respectfully requesting you to thoroughly investigate the truth and provide guidance so that I may follow it, so as to align with the national war of resistance front and not be shaken by the secret calculations of villains. I would be very grateful."

### Hong Kong and Kowloon War Zone Service Corps Members – Serving in Military and Political Work on the Front Lines – Mostly on the East and West Battlefields

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Community Relief Joint Association, after the July 7th Incident in the previous year, specially organized the Northbound War Zone Service Corps, recruiting over twenty enthusiastic young people to go through customs and, one week after the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai Battle (August 20th), departed from Hong Kong, taking the Guangdong-Hankou Railway north to the capital to serve the country, pioneering the return of young people to the country for service after the start of the War of Resistance. After the corps arrived in the capital, the central authorities sent them separately to the Military Affairs Commission Training Class and the Political Science School Special Training Class for training, and then dispatched them to various war zones in the east, west, and north for service. However, regarding the work situation after the corps' members were assigned, due to inconvenient transportation and communication, news was scarce, and few people in Hong Kong knew about it. A reporter met with the chairman of the corps, Du Qizhang, yesterday and learned the details of the corps' recent situation. According to him, those currently on the western battlefield include Zeng Mei, Zhang Rentao, Zhuang Difu, and Lin Jiazhao, who are working in the People's Movement Guidance Office of the ×th War Zone Commander's Headquarters, serving as people's movement instructors in various counties. On the eastern battlefield, Chen Zhi is in the political department of the ×××th Division, and Huang Wei and Zhang Sheng are in the Military Affairs Commission Training Corps. Zhan Lin is serving in the Nanchang Women's Improvement Association, and Zhou Zhansheng has entered a military academy for further study and is now also dispatched to front-line work. Furthermore, Chen Zhifeng, the communications team leader of the corps, returned to Hong Kong from the front line in Nanxun a month ago, reporting on the work he has done over the past year and collecting various medicines and supplies. He is scheduled to go north again during the day to return to his unit for service.

### Deputy Secretary for Chinese Affairs Breaks Up Another Human Trafficking Ring in Yau Ma Tei – Six Girls Under Twenty Years Old Rescued – One Suspected Woman Arrested, Case to be Prosecuted Next Week

Since the implementation of the ban on prostitution in Hong Kong, the number of clandestine prostitutes has greatly increased, and the poison has become increasingly rampant. Furthermore, the bandits who engage in human trafficking see this as a huge market for their operations, each acting as cause and effect. Therefore, due to the rampant nature of clandestine prostitution, these unscrupulous elements have become even more active. The Hong Kong government authorities have always been concerned about this matter and have recently intensified their anti-prostitution campaign. According to this newspaper, Ms. Harrier of the Hong Kong Deputy Secretary for Chinese Affairs has made great efforts in breaking up human trafficking rings, having solved many cases. Yesterday, she broke up another such human trafficking ring somewhere in Yau Ma Tei, rescuing six girls on the spot, all under the age of twenty. Among them, one was only thirteen years old, and another was only fourteen. A suspected female accomplice, Ms. So-and-so, was arrested and will be prosecuted at the Kowloon Magistracy next Tuesday for the crime of harboring girls under the age of sixteen for immoral purposes. As for the two youngest girls, they were sent to the Salvation Army Home for care.

### British Ministry of Civil Aviation – Planning to Establish a North Atlantic Air Route – 3,000 Miles from Ireland to Newfoundland – Will Benefit Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Business Significantly

According to aviation sources, the British Ministry of Civil Aviation is planning to establish a North Atlantic air route, with a route from northern Ireland to Newfoundland, a total distance of approximately 2,000 miles. The establishment of this route will indirectly benefit Hong Kong significantly. Since the two major global air routes (Pan American and Imperial Airways) have Hong Kong as their Far East terminus, flights from Europe to Hong Kong must pass through the Suez Canal and Penang before transferring to Hong Kong. Flights from the United States to Hong Kong pass through the Pacific Ocean, via Honolulu, Guam, and the Philippines to Hong Kong. Passengers wishing to travel from Europe to the Far East via the Americas must first travel by sea to New York, then transfer by air to San Francisco and take a Pan American flight to Hong Kong, involving many transfers along the way. The establishment of the North Atlantic route will remedy this deficiency. The British civil aviation authorities have already established powerful radio stations in western Ireland and Newfoundland to receive weather reports from observatories and ships at sea around the world. After the route is established, those wishing to circumnavigate the globe by plane from Hong Kong, starting eastward, can take a Pan American plane to San Francisco, then transfer to Vancouver, then cross Canada to Newfoundland, and take a flight across the Atlantic to Southampton, England, and then follow the Imperial Airways route through the Suez Canal and Penang back to Hong Kong. Traveling westward, they can first fly to Penang and finally return to Hong Kong via the Americas. It is reported that the route will initially only carry mail and will not carry passengers for the time being.

### The Jinshan Steamer Will Not Go to Guangzhou Again in the Short Term

Recently, there have been rumors that the Jinshan steamer will go to the province again during the day and will change its route to the Guangzhou-Hong Kong line in the future. A reporter asked the person in charge of the Guangzhou-Hong Kong-Macau Steamship Company about this yesterday, and he denied the above statement, saying that there are still several conditions for the resumption of the Guangzhou-Hong Kong route that have not been negotiated. The Jinshan steamer's recent voyage to Guangzhou was actually a trial voyage in nature. The date of full resumption can only be realized after all conditions have been fully resolved and agreed upon by both parties. It is still far from this time, and the Jinshan steamer will not sail to Guangzhou again in the near future. The rumors are not credible.

### Tour of the Refugee Industrial Society

— Luo Xia

Special Report from Our Newspaper

If we are not forgetful, we will always remember that Shanghai, a prosperous and beautiful city, had just fallen. Mr. He Xiangning made a proposal at the first joint meeting of the Four Women's Associations – to establish a women's refugee vocational training center. At that time, this proposal was enthusiastically supported. Time passes really quickly, and it is now almost a year later. Today, one year later, Ms. Wang Liming, a politician, has finally combined with a group of enthusiastic local women to establish the Refugee Industrial Society amidst difficulties and hardships. Although the scale is not very grand, this must be considered a glorious creation of the Hong Kong women's community, and its future development can be expected. Running around here, the reporter will roughly record the impressions gained from touring this Refugee Industrial Society:

Passing through the shipyard where the masts stand tall and the green waves ripple on the Triangular Pier, following the twists and turns of the tram tracks, I stepped onto the upper floor of a large and new building. On the second floor and third floor, the smell of putty, along with a tense atmosphere, rushed into my heart. Stepping into the entrance of the fourth floor, "click-clack," "click-clack," the sound of sewing machines kept flowing, exuding a busy and tense mood inside. Knocking on the door, after a while, a woman wearing a blue cloth long shirt came out, and after clarifying the intention, she let the reporter in. Looking around, the spacious veranda on the left was filled with long and wide tables, surrounded by working girls. In the main hall on the right, a wide table was displayed, and a group of girls were working there. Behind each wall pillar, a sewing machine was piled up. One cannot help but admire the cleverness of the arrangement in making good use of the space.

These dozens of daughters who have tasted the pain of exile are either working with their heads down or working while talking and laughing. Everyone is always working with their hands never stopping. Seeing the unfamiliar guest, a blush of shyness appeared on everyone's faces, with a little bit of shyness. Talking with Miss Luo Qiao'er, who is responsible for guiding their work there, about their living conditions, I heard that after getting up every day, they have breakfast, do exercises, and then start working. They work eight hours a day, read books in the evening, and have scheduled times for eating and working. Everything in life is completely disciplined. They are obediently working, warmly caring for each other, more like the female workers in a refugee industrial society, more like a beautiful school, and a happy family. Their hearts are joyfully jumping, even though the three meals are so simple.

Their work is temporarily divided into five departments: sewing clothes, Gu embroidery, sewing shoes, knitting wool sweaters, and making flowers. After a short period of guidance, they are all able to work very quickly. Now, almost all kinds of products have already been pre-ordered. However, although they are working with their hands and feet without stopping, they only earn an average of thirty cents a day, which is still far from enough to cover the expenses here. This really requires a good method!" Miss Luo said worriedly, exhaling a breath. Their spirit of fighting and hard work is very admirable.

However, we feel that this refugee center is not very suitable in this prosperous location. At the very least, it has to bear an expensive rent. Secondly, it has not been able to plan for the production of many low-cost and high-profit necessities, such as soap, cosmetics, toothbrushes, and other items. Secondly, there is still room for consideration in the allocation of manpower in the work. With such a small number of people, we think it is not appropriate to produce several different items. It is best to divide it into two or three departments. Moreover, the stages of work also need to be done in order. For example, when making flowers, one person cuts paper, one person cuts wire, and one person glues. Such division of labor and cooperation is always more economical than the time it takes for one person to make a flower by themselves. If manpower and resources can be improved considerably, I believe that production will definitely increase, and then the required expenses can definitely be met with ease!

Finally, we hope that all the enthusiastic people in charge of the Refugee Industrial Society will continue their efforts to establish the second, third, and so on… refugee industrial societies, directly relieving those fellow women who have encountered difficulties, and indirectly using production to build a new China.

### From Lian County to Hong Kong (II)

— Xi Min

——Walking Nearly Eight Hundred Li——

On the third day, we took a car early in the morning and arrived at Qingyuan City. Because of the fear that the × people might again invade north along Sanshui, threatening Sihui, which is located to its west, with a state of war, it would not be easy to pass through the shortcut on the western side of the southern Guangdong battlefield. Therefore, before hurriedly heading towards Zhaoqing along the eastern bank of the Beijiang River, the street below the county seat we passed through was originally a district with rows of shops, but it was almost razed to the ground when Guangzhou fell. It is said that the compatriots who suffered the disaster were able to escape in time, so it was not too tragic. Regarding the public security issue on the Qingyuan-Sihui highway, I inquired with the head of the education section of the Qingyuan County government, and he assured me that there had been no disturbances for travelers in recent months. Then I felt relieved and rushed southwest. The plan was to spend the night in Sankeng, within the territory of Qingyuan-Sihui County. Although it was only a short sixty-li journey, due to continuous labor in recent days, I arrived at dusk. My feet were sore, and blisters had appeared on the soles. After being led into that unbearably dirty inn by the porter, I collapsed onto the bed. After resting for four hours, I still could not restore my energy. In that extremely narrow room, I thought to myself that my physical constitution had never been weak, but I suddenly encountered a relatively difficult life and immediately collapsed. This was indeed a lesson for myself, and for things in general.

Moving forward along the Qingyuan-Sihui Highway, of course, was because it had already been damaged. I set off early in the morning on the 4th. Although I was exhausted, I still had to complete more than eighty li that day. There were particularly many porters coming in the opposite direction along the way. I asked the porter and learned that today was the market day in Sankeng. No wonder there were so many people staying in the inn there last night. He also told me that when the × people occupied Luba, Sihui was in a state of emergency. This highway was supervised by the defense army, and villagers along the road were required to complete the destruction of designated sections within a few hours before H-hour on a certain night, demonstrating the power of the people. The so-called cooperation between the military and the people, working together as one, at this critical juncture, there is indeed a need to go one step further.

The market town of Sihui was also devastated by bombing, and the market situation was bleak. Without intending to, I stayed in an inn. Just as it was beginning to dawn, the waiter woke me up by knocking on the door, because of the fear of air raids. Because of the continuous rainy days, I have not yet discovered any × aircraft in the places I have passed through. Getting up early, if I followed the Sihui Highway directly to Zhaoqing, an important town on the Xijiang River, there would be concerns that the × people would cut off the shortcut from northwestern Guangdong to Hong Kong and Macau. At the very least, it would reduce some of the seriousness. I did not start early on the 9th. On the way to Zhaoqing, because I could not overcome the fatigue of many days, I wanted to hire a sedan chair to travel the thirty-li road in one day. However, the cost was too high, two yuan per ten li. Not only were there too many broken places on this section of the road, but also because of the continuous rain, the large gaps not only required detours, but also many places did not allow the passenger to not jump down, otherwise the sedan chair and the person would fall head over heels, and there would be another misfortune. Therefore, after running sixty li, I stayed in Guangli, which belongs to the fourth district of Gaoyao County. This is a distribution point for goods not far west of the confluence of the Beijiang River and the Xijiang River in Sanshui. Although I often heard the sound of machine guns and artillery fire from the southeast where my heroic self-defense corps soldiers were fighting the × people with the most resolute enthusiasm, the residents were still so calm, doing business, coming and going, and grazing after the autumn harvest, all peacefully spending their original lives. Even though they are like this, what should they do if the enemy cavalry breaks in one day?

On the 6th, I could hire a small boat from Guangli directly to Zhaoqing. Sitting cramped in the boat, the dull sound of artillery fire continued to knock on my eardrums. The standing army of the local self-defense corps divided into five stations for inspection. Because it was not very strict, it did not take much time. In winter, the water level drops. When passing through the Zhaoqing Gorge, the water level during the previous high tide was still high, engraved more than ten feet above the water surface. The wind was very strong, and some of the companions were seasick. The boatman talked to me about this and that with a bitter face. He had rowed to this corner of the Xijiang River in Zhaoqing Prefecture two days before Guangzhou fell. He also said that after the Tax Police Regiment lost the provincial capital, they saw that the social order in the counties and cities near the war zone had changed dramatically. Therefore, some of them were scattered in battle, and naturally there were other elements among them, and they even committed the ugly act of looting compatriots who were seeking refuge. Once, that swaggering platoon leader was reported for taking twenty small packages of local tobacco from a farmer, and was then executed by firing squad. From then on, killing one as a warning to a hundred, coupled with the cessation of hostilities in recent months, the tragic events of turmoil and displacement quickly decreased.

Zhaoqing, which had also been ravaged by × aircraft, was also covered in continuous drizzling rain. It lay quietly and lonely by the river. I also saw barges going to and from Wuzhou braving the smoke and fog. The pedestrians on the river embankment were crowded. Snack vendors were even excitedly doing business in that area. The threat to life forced people to come and go here despite the dangers. And how many travelers trembled before the god of death. Life is meaningless, and they have to desperately fight for this "life." On the morning of the 7th, it rained heavily. I heard that there were still vehicles running from Zhaoqing to Xinyu County. Sure enough, this section of the highway led us directly to our destination. The hundred-li journey took five hours to build. I arrived before noon that day. I wanted to head towards Heping, which was sixty li away, and the road along the Heping pond to Kaiping County was still forty li. However, the porters' asking price was too high, so I temporarily stayed in Xinyu County. The merchants here, like those elsewhere, used greedy eyes to judge whether their trading partners were passing through when purchasing food and lodging. Using national currency as the unit of transaction certainly had opportunities for trickery, and the prices were even higher. They often dared to discount the paper money of the Farmers Bank of China, and even other national currencies were discounted by them, which is extremely hateful. It was also very troublesome not to trade with ten-yuan or five-yuan national currency. This is how ordinary good merchants and those with slight financial power in their operating areas make profits, while the majority of the working people suffer from their writing. In eleven hours, with the pace of a forced march, I completed more than a hundred li of damaged highway in one day. I spent the night in Cangcheng (Kaiping County). I heard that there was an electric boat directly to Macau at Chikan, which was forty-five li away. The journey tomorrow morning would end my walking difficulties. I had a meeting with a friend again in the evening, and I was overjoyed.

After breakfast on the 8th, I borrowed a friend's bicycle, thinking that I could easily reach Yikan, the cultural center of Kaiping, through the slightly damaged highway. How could I have imagined that although this county highway had been demolished by the villagers along the road only in recent days, they had deeply dug up the sand and soil on the roadbed on both sides, so that the smooth and flat road surface was so crowded that those who came and went had to fall into the trap and then climb up to the earthen mounds on the opposite side. Is this seemingly the spirit of sacrificing to the end? I believe that in military terms, when automatically destroying transportation infrastructure that is about to be withdrawn or can be used by the enemy, the first requirement is to reach the military situation where it is necessary to destroy it, and there are also ways to destroy it. It is not necessary to add details here. At that time, using a bicycle as a means of transportation, I was indeed unable to get down or up, my face was full of sweat, and the people who were defending the country along the way laughed. I was to blame and should not complain. And many runners, although they could cross the gaps, all those who fell were seen.

The waterway from Chikan to Sanfu (Changsha belongs to Kaiping, Dihai and Xinchang belong to Taishan) is shallow and narrow. Originally, barges from Guangzhou to Sanfu could not go directly to Chikan to leave. On the 9th, I arrived at the port of Ming. There was an electric boat with a shallow draft that sailed directly to Macau from here. The restaurant charged five yuan, and the cabin charged four, both in national currency. The number of passengers was not too crowded. Originally, it was inevitable that passengers and dreamers would not be able to have smooth sailing. Indeed, when the boat arrived at Yushasha in Zhongshan County, there were many narrow rivers and boats, and the electric boat could not surge forward. So it called for all passengers to transfer to a barge to go. The barge could not move forward either. The passengers who were on the barge advised the passengers to go ashore and cross the shallow and narrow part of the river. The passengers questioned whether there would be a way to continue. They replied that neither the barge nor the boat had anyone in charge. Only by each party paying thirty cents could they attach to other barges to Macau. And they said that if not, it would be inevitable to wait here for several days. The passengers then followed. When attaching to another ferry, the person in charge of the designated ferry actually asked the passengers to sell two yuan of national currency. It was the morning of the 10th, and × aircraft circled overhead, while traitors were defrauding below. The morning of crossing Macau to Hong Kong was the 11th. Those who resided in the counties along the Huangwu Railway mostly had only two ways to go to Hong Kong, one to Shantou and the other to Guangzhou Bay and then to Hong Kong. Many did not know that there was this shortcut.

### A Glimpse of the Current Situation in Wusong: The Market is Desolate, and Smoking and Gambling are Rampant

[Shanghai Correspondence] After the × organization of Baoshan established various agencies, the "County Chief" was changed to "Chief of Political Affairs," and Yan Gangru, a native of Beichuan Sha, was appointed. Its name is "Baoshan District Political Affairs Office of Shanghai Special Municipality." Wusong is under the jurisdiction of Baoshan, and the "Wusong Town Political Affairs Sub-Office" was established, with Zhao Xianliang, a native of Beishengjiaqiao in Yuepu, as the "Town Chief." The × "Police Bureau" was also divided by Baoshan to establish the Wusong Sub-Station. It has been in operation for nearly four months. The "Patrol Officer," Wang Qin, is nearly thirty years old, a native of Jiangbei. He previously served as a patrol officer in Shenhang Town, Songnan. It is said that he is capable of extorting and is superior to others. There are more than thirty unarmed policemen in total. Because the people of Wusong heard Japanese officers declare that Wusong is a military area and cannot be officially opened, most of the well-capitalized merchants do not dare to return to Wusong. Only small merchants and poor residents have no ability to maintain their livelihoods outside, so they have to return to Wusong Town. However, the number is very small. In addition to twelve or three small restaurants and tea houses, there are only twenty or thirty other rice shops, sauce and wine workshops, etc. Therefore, the market is desolate, and business is sluggish, not enough to cover expenses. However, smoking and gambling are particularly rampant. There are more than ten swallow's nests and opium dens. The license fee for opium sales and smoking places is ten yuan per month. Opium addicts smoke openly, without any scruples. Tea houses rely on commission gambling as their main business. Mahjong, Twenty-One Points, Pai Gow, etc. are quite lively. In the Jin surname Shikumen house in the Li family's residence in West Road, a Japanese brothel is set up, with full of rouge and powder. Eight Japanese women in kimonos and backpacks are busy entertaining. In the evening, the electric lights are brilliant, and yellow-clothed people come and go in an endless stream. The original site of the Renrentang pharmacy on Tongxing Road is used as a unified canteen. Four Japanese women are responsible for cooking and serving. Sometimes they even sing and drink along. There are also three or four foreign women who have been staying in Wusong for a long time. These people are all yellow-faced and black-toothed, and their opium appearances are exposed. Driven by life, they also pretend to be shockingly glamorous, as tools for lustful slaves to vent their desires, in order to make a living. It is worthy of a sigh. (January 12th)

### Guangxi Province Highway (II)

— Pan Taifeng

And its along-line scenery

Guilin is located in the northwest of the province. The highways starting from here include the Guihuang, Guihe, Guiliu, and Guiyong lines. 1. The Guihuang Line was built in the 15th year of the Republic of China. It travels northwest from Guilin to the Huanghe River on the border of Hunan and Guangxi.

The slope of the mandarin duck slope in the first section reaches 10%, which is the largest slope of the national highway. There are many low-lying places where the water is flooded from time to time. During the construction of the third section, the road surface was not paved, and most of the bridges were built of wood. After several improvements, the situation gradually improved.

### This Year's Financial Situation Becomes More Stable; Developing the Economy of the Rear Area (Part 1); International Balance of Payments Situation Further Improves; Capital Inflows Assist Internal Development

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the national financial front has remained stable. Through long-term testing and overcoming numerous difficulties, public and private financial organizations have become increasingly perfect. The people's trust has grown daily. Now, a decision has been made to use its full strength to develop the economy of the rear area, allowing capital to flow inland and assisting in development. Details are recorded below:

This Year's Finances Are More Relaxed

The four major banks, namely the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Bank of China, have joint offices and discount committees in major cities with branches. They handle the discounting and mortgage lending of agricultural, industrial, and commercial bills. This discount method is partly a commercial mortgage loan, but it also has regulations for re-discounting and discounting. Therefore, it also has the function of the central bank regulating finances. Currently, the amount of loans discounted is approximately 100 million yuan. Since its implementation, the national financial situation has been extremely stable. Last year, there were no bank runs or credit crunches, nor were there signs of financial panic. At the beginning of this year, the financial situation became even more relaxed. Therefore, the discount committee stopped direct lending. When needed, the Banking Association applies on behalf of the applicant.

Exerting Efforts to Develop the Economy of the Rear Area

In order to develop the economy of the rear area, the government is encouraging production enterprises to move inland and is also striving to promote the circulation of local finance. Local financial institutions can obtain one-yuan notes and subsidiary currency notes from the four major banks to assist production enterprises in the interior. The purpose is to encourage financial institutions to invest in agriculture, industry, and mining, in order to correct the past imbalance of focusing on urban finance. It is now decided to (1) encourage exports, facilitate remittances from overseas Chinese, (2) find ways to collect gold and silver, (3) increase the number of local financial institutions, (4) promote thrift campaigns, (5) encourage various types of production, (6) increase agricultural lending, (7) provide credit loans, and (8) train financial personnel. The above items have all been implemented successively.

Particularly Cautious in Issuing Policies

China's legal tender policy had already been successful before the war, and its credibility has increased through the war. The legal tender's cash reserves have consistently been above 60%, while the guarantee reserves have been below 40%. Previous inspections have all been in line with the statutory ratios. As for the issuance limit, at the end of 1937, it was 1,639,098,000 yuan, which increased to 1,726,998,000 in June 1938. The rate of increase is no longer as fast as in the early stages of the reform. From December 1935 to December 1936, the total amount issued increased by 568,979,000 yuan, while in the first half of 1938, the increase was only 87.9 million yuan, which is sufficient to prove the caution in its issuance.

### Li Hua Cup Preliminary Round First Act: Army United vs. Western Staff Team Kicks Off at 3:30 PM at Kowloon Field

[Special Report from This Newspaper] "The emotional relationship is about to end, counting the days until spring arrives, may I ask the healthy athletes of the football kingdom, will you be surprised that time passes easily?

A beauty since ancient times is like a famous general, not allowing people to see her white hair." It is the same for those who compete on the football field, but who can maintain their youth forever and avoid aging?

Today is the start of the Li Hua Cup football preliminary round, with the Western Staff United team and the Army United team facing off. The game kicks off at 3:30 PM at the Kowloon field.

Before 1936, the Western team was at its peak, winning the championship seven times. However, after 1936, due to the scattering of talented players from the Western team, their dominance completely disappeared, and they no longer looked down on everything.

Although the current Western team representatives are said to be outstanding, the overall strength of the team is actually insufficient compared to the Army United team. Therefore, I don't think the Western team has the look of a champion. The Army United team has won the championship consecutively and still has strong ambitions. Moreover, this time, the selection is unique. The central defender Pi Yaxun is not used, and the defender Bi Tidi is not selected. Instead, they appreciate those outside the usual picks, selecting Dun from the military supplies and Yong Stanli from the Fifth Battalion Artillery.

The art of war says, "Observe what is not yet formed, see what is not yet completed, and you will win every battle." With such a selection method, the Army United team must have a well-thought-out plan.

A message to the fans: if you want a good show, please arrive early. But a reminder: do not bring children, and do not scalp tickets outside the venue. Each spectator may not purchase more than three tickets. The lineups for both teams are as follows (Football Field God):

Army United Team

Wei Jianchen (Middlesex), Ge Luohua (Fifth Battalion Artillery)

Shi Han (Middlesex), Su Shishi (Middlesex)

He Li (Flag Team), Bo Luodu (Tenth Thousand Team), Wenton (Military Supplies Team)

Qu Chen (Middlesex), Ge Geni (Middlesex)

Yong Stanli (Fifth Battalion Artillery), Ge Luogen (Middlesex)

Western Staff Team

Han Ni Lu (Kowloon Club), Liao Yaxun (Kowloon Club)

Dao Liezhi (Kowloon Club)

Hou Lu (Police Club)

Gao Lusi (Hong Kong Club), Bei Lishi (Kowloon Club), Fu La (Hong Kong)

Pa Jia (Police Club)

Zuo Zhi (Kowloon Club)

### South China's Southern Expedition Team Suffers a Miserable Defeat, Losing Soldiers and Generals; Shao Han Injured and Leaves the Field in a Fierce Battle; Two Penalty Kicks are the Fatal Blow to South China

(Special Airmail Report from Saigon, 15th) This time, the South China team traveled a long distance, fighting five games in a week. Facing famous teams, they won every game, showing invincibility. However, after a break following the game against the South Ky United Team B last night, the battle against the United Team A resumed today. After a short rest, their physical strength had not recovered. To lead a tired army against a fresh team is a dangerous move for experienced strategists. The United Team A is composed of the elite of this area. Taking advantage of this weakness, they attacked with force. Although the South China team members have an indestructible body, their strength will eventually be exhausted. Even tigers take naps, inevitably being taken advantage of. Unfortunately, they lost due to a penalty free kick, losing three to one. As Mr. Li Foye said, "We are not made of iron," which is truly not their fault in battle.

At 3:00 PM this afternoon, the Stone Stadium was already full. Because the United Team is one of the strongest teams here, fans knew there would be a fierce battle. The number of Chinese, French, and Vietnamese spectators totaled over 10,000, unprecedented.

With the sound of the silver whistle, the game began. The United Team attacked like tigers, their three armies rushing forward, attacking the South China side with swift and decisive strikes, shooting as soon as they arrived. Fortunately, South China goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai was agile, catching a "fancy ball." The United Team failed to capitalize and continued their attack. Players from both sides fought fiercely, shooting repeatedly. Zhang Rongcai caught them all, turning danger into safety. Li Tiansheng waved his weapon and was able to drive the enemy out of the area. The South China team immediately counterattacked, but the United Team continued their relentless attacks. After several battles, Li Zhaorong managed to receive the ball and shoot, but it flew into the air. Several attempts to score failed due to bad luck. Chen De'an fired up this time, taking advantage of Feng Jingxiang's pass, shooting from a distance that was difficult to score. The United Team seized the opportunity, intercepting the ball. The right winger immediately rushed up, passing three defenders. The ball was as fast as an arrow, shocking the spectators. It seemed certain that a goal would be scored, but Zhang Rongcai jumped and caught the ball, saving it from going in. It can be said that this ball was extremely dangerous. It is a pity that every time he catches a dangerous ball, he kicks it out without considering the surrounding enemies, allowing them to attack again. This negligence should be paid attention to in the future. Therefore, the United Team came back and attacked continuously. Li Tiansheng had the responsibility to defend the territory, heading the ball to clear it. However, the danger was not yet over. Another counter-attack was launched, finally stabilizing the situation. However, the South China team was too civilized, and their tackling was not strong enough, often being robbed by the opponent's skill. Before long, they were forced to a corner kick, but it was unsuccessful. Feng Jingxiang immediately launched a counterattack, passing to Liu Songsheng to kick, but it was blocked by a United Team defender. Feng then tried to head the ball, but it was unsuccessful. After much commotion, Li Zhaorong launched a surprise attack from afar, but it was difficult to win. This was really due to the weakness of the central defense line, which was often broken through deep into the territory. At this point, the United Team's counterattack became more intense. Li Tiansheng defended the city with all his might, heading the ball like a bird, which was very exciting. The United Team shot from left and right, but it was difficult to score. Although there are good defenders, there is nothing they can do under the pressure of a large army. Therefore, in the melee, the United Team's right winger (number 10) rushed up, and Mai Shaohan tackled him down outside the goal. In the heat of trying to save the ball, which is common, the referee ruled a penalty two-yard free kick. Of course, he scored, and a round of applause came from one side. (The first half ended, with South China losing by one goal).

After the break, the second half began immediately. The South China team launched a large-scale counterattack, attempting to avenge themselves. Yang Shuiyi stirred up trouble on the border, which could have earned him a high honor, but he was intercepted by the enemy, losing an opportunity in a hurry. However, the Chinese side had a corner kick, and the danger was averted. Feng Jingxiang had a chance to take advantage of. Chen De'an shot, but it was just out of reach, failing at the last moment. The two sides fought harder and harder. The United Team was again awarded a corner kick. Li Zhaorong was angry, but his magic had no effect, and he failed again. Fearing being captured, Liu Songsheng fired from a distance, but it was also intercepted, an extreme misfortune in ball luck. It was a chaotic and dark battle. Li Guowei was forced to bravely fight through, and Feng Jingxiang charged forward lightly. Zhaorong missed another opportunity. The United Team took advantage of this, launching a desperate counterattack. Li Tiansheng could not react in time, and Zhang Rongcai was eager to save the ball, resulting in a penalty free kick outside the boundary, causing a big mistake. The United Team rushed in, and Mai Shaohan was injured and out of the game. In the chaos, he scored a goal, making it three to zero. The South China team was almost shutout. As a result, they put in their best efforts, showing their individual skills. It was a pity that Yang Shuiyi had a good chance but missed it again. After repeated attacks failed, and with songs from all sides, the formation was greatly disrupted. Before long, Yang Shuiyi was determined to go it alone, but he could not get what he wanted. The United Team became more and more unscrupulous, repeatedly trying to invade. Yang Shuiyi had a chance to counterattack, but it failed again. That day, he lost his usual form. The whole team collapsed. He should take responsibility for this. From then on, the overall situation was lost, and it was difficult to turn the tide. Until two minutes before the end of the game, Feng Jingxiang waved his arms and shouted, arousing the spirits. The cavalry rushed forward, passing the central defense. Liu Songsheng took advantage of the situation and rushed forward, breaking the shutout record. However, the time was gone. Although Li Guowei was brave, he only earned a handshake with the opponent's center forward to say goodbye. The silver whistle sounded for a long time, and South China lost three to one.

### Movies

Entertainment... The Lone Wolf of Paris

The content of a bizarre robbery, the style of comedy and humor, and the layout of the story are quite tortuous. However, many climaxes in the film pass by plainly. It tells the story of a world-famous jewel thief who has already reformed and no longer engages in theft. However, in Paris, he helps a princess of a small country retrieve the pearls of the imperial crown. He uses his empty-handed skills again, cleverly stealing the pearls, and battling wits with the treacherous duke who coveted the pearls. Only when the princess's younger brother is about to ascend the throne does he complete his task in a moment, allowing the young monarch to ascend the throne.

Francis Lederer and Frances Drake are both very competent in this film.

Queen... Color Film Highlights

Walt Disney's pen-and-ink animated films are continued and welcomed by every audience, especially after the success of his "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." They have received great attention from moviegoers. This "Color Film Highlights" screening selects and assembles his most recent works, totaling ten films, listed below:

"The Fox Hunt," "The Crazy Parrot," "Livestock Symphony," "Golfing Laughs," "Prince of the Crystal Palace," "Silver Star Tales," "The Whale Hunt," "Lucky Day," "The Ungrateful Bull," "Giants' Tale."

The painting techniques of each film, as well as the coordination of colors and tones, are all as perfect as possible. The stories are short, lively, and full of strong interest. In addition to Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, there are also new creations. Among them, "The Ungrateful Bull," "Prince of the Crystal Palace," "Silver Star Tales," and "Giants' Tale" are particularly outstanding.

Peace... The Mad Miss Manton

A film that combines romance and a mysterious murder case, performed in a humorous and crazy style. Barbara Stanwyck plays a terribly bad socialite who accidentally discovers a corpse. She reports it to the police, but by the time the detectives arrive, the corpse has been moved away by the murderer. Because of her usual conduct, people think she is trying to show off and made up a lie. This is obviously a wrong accusation. What makes her even more unbearable is that a young editor (Henry Fonda) satirizes her in the newspaper. So, she gathers a group of sisters to conduct a search. After discovering the second corpse, people sympathize with and believe her, especially the young editor, who gives her a lot of help. At that time, the murderer wants to kill her to silence her, but fortunately, the detectives surround and annihilate the murderer, and she is spared.

The plot of the film lacks some possibility, but due to the excellent performance of the actors, the development of the plot is natural and relaxed. The arrangement of the assassination case is also quite tortuous, but it does not occupy an important position in the film. Because what is used to attract the audience in this film is not a tense and serious detective story, but a strong comedic interest.

East... White Tiger Demon God

Although it cannot be said to be a poorly made production, it is not particularly brilliant. However, the background and material of the story are more novel and different compared to ordinary beast films. Director Cliff Wyatt has considerable experience in shooting beast films, and the handling of this film is still acceptable.

Dahua... Rose Marie

A musical singing love film starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, with excellent performances. When Nelson Eddy goes to capture his daughter, the inner conflicts of public and private matters are handled quite successfully by the director.

### Lihua Cup Football Preliminary - Li Huitang's Reason for Helping - Shanghai Telephones Urge Him to Go North to Participate in Charity Match

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] The selection of players for the Chinese Football Team in this Lihua Cup match has been greatly affected because many players from the China Education Association’s football team have traveled south to Saigon. This has caused considerable consternation among members of the Hong Kong Football Association. The previously selected lineup for the Chinese team had to be completely overturned and re-selected a few days ago. Many consider this a strange occurrence, but upon closer examination, it is not so unusual.

During the initial selection period, football star Li Huitang, due to an unhealed foot injury, expressed his unwillingness to participate in the match. Subsequently, the Football Association believed that the lineup was insufficient to attract a large audience and considered the failure of Dan Jiang and South China to send several players to Hong Kong as a breach of agreement. At the same time, they earnestly requested that Huitang overcome his difficulties and promised to play in the match. Li, seeing that a simple appearance by him could ease the dissatisfaction of the Association towards his parent club, South China, finally agreed to help. Thus, the team was re-selected entirely a few days ago.

Unable to Refuse, He Reluctantly Takes the Field

Yesterday, I happened to pass by Li’s residence and inquired about the recent condition of his foot injury and whether he was satisfied with the second selection of players. According to Li, his injury has not fully healed, and he even showed me the marks as proof. His right shin has two bruises, and his left knee has one, all still black and blue. He feels conflicted about participating in the match. If he prioritizes his own well-being and refuses to play, he would be unable to mend the Football Association’s relationship with South China. However, if he plays, his foot injury is not fully healed, and he lacks suitable soccer shoes, making it difficult for him to perform at his usual level.

Upon hearing his mention of lacking suitable soccer shoes, I curiously inquired about the details. He explained, "Whether or not a pair of soccer shoes fits properly has a significant impact on one's performance. Experienced players like you understand this well. The soccer shoes I usually use are currently being used by Liu Qingcai, who took them to Saigon. New shoes cannot be broken in quickly, and finding suitable ones is difficult. It is difficult for me to find a substitute that fits my foot perfectly. I can only hope that Liang Yanzan, who is known for having large feet, has a pair that might fit."

Li added that since his injury during the international match, he has not engaged in any physical exercise to recuperate, so his stamina is definitely not as good as before. Furthermore, since the soccer shoes are not his usual ones, he cannot guarantee his performance will be up to par. The outcome of a soccer match is difficult to predict. He will only do his best. If his performance falls short of his usual standard, he hopes the audience will be understanding and not overly critical.

Finally, I inquired about his opinion on the strength of the second selected team. He replied that he has been busy lately and rarely watches other teams play, so he is not familiar with the skills of the emerging players. However, since they have been approved and recruited by the selection committee, they must possess considerable skill. His only concern is that many of the players have not had the opportunity to cooperate with him before, so there might be some lack of coordination. He does not dare to comment on others, but he himself is worried that the absence of familiar collaborators like Feng Jixiang might hinder his scoring opportunities. If the two inside forwards could retreat slightly and provide timely passes, it might be easier to find openings for scoring.

Li Huitang's Dividing Himself for Multiple Obligations

Furthermore, the Football Association sent a letter to Li yesterday morning, requesting that he definitely participate in the Hong Kong-Philippines inter-port match during the Lunar New Year to represent Hong Kong. At the same time, Huang Jiajun also urged him to definitely help the Chinese football team in the charity match between Hong Kong and the Hong Kong League on February 26th, to increase its appeal. It is said that Li has agreed to appear on both occasions without fail. Unexpectedly, soon after, Lu Ai'yun, Chairman of the Hong Kong Sports Service Group, forwarded a telegram from Sir Zhou Shoushen in Shanghai, urging Li to go to Shanghai during the Lunar New Year to attend a charity event for refugees organized there. The telegram read:

To Mr. Zhou Shoushen,

Shanghai newspapers report that Li Huitang is strongly urged to come to Shanghai to participate in the charity match. I am deeply grateful.

We have scheduled the match for February 20th. Please have Mr. Li depart on that day. We look forward to his arrival. Li Gui, Shanghai National Relief Association. After receiving the telegram, Li, seeing that the Shanghai match and the Hong Kong international match are on the same day, found it difficult to fulfill the Shanghai request. He also has the charity match on February 26th, and needs to be in Hong Kong, it is impossible for him to be in Shanghai until after February 26th. Therefore, he has asked Sir Zhou to reply to the Shanghai organizers and request that the Shanghai charity match be changed to March 4th, so that he can be in Shanghai. It is said that postponing the Shanghai match would slightly affect revenue. (Old Companion of the Football Field)

### The Experience of a Slave of a Vanquished Nation

— Xing Tian

Flipping through old books, I found "The Northern Sketches of the Late Ming Dynasty," which contains much that is worth reading. For example, there is a passage in Volume 1 under "The Fall of Liaoyang" that records the painful experience of the people of a conquered nation, which stirs up endless sorrow when read. I copy it below:

"In the seventeenth year of Shunzhi, a student from Liaoyang named Yang served as the governor of Songjiang. He and Liu Guoyuan, a Jinshi from Wuxi, were drinking and watching a theatrical performance. When the wine was flowing, Yang slapped the table and shouted, 'Stop! It's wrong!' Liu asked, 'Does the old governor have a deep understanding of ancient laws?'

Yang replied, 'My life was also spared by luck. In the initial fall of Liaodong, fearing that the poor would rebel, they first arrested and killed the poor. Two years later, fearing that the rich would gather and cause trouble, they killed them all again, sparing only the four classes of people. The first class were leather workers who could make good shoes; they were spared. The second class were carpenters who could make utensils; they were spared. The third class were needleworkers who could sew fur hats; they were spared. The fourth class were actors who could sing Han songs; they were spared. They especially wanted to kill scholars. At that time, I was a student, eager to make progress, and I was studying behind closed doors, so my face was rather plump and white. I was arrested and asked, 'Are you not a scholar?' I replied, 'No, I am an actor!' Actors must be good at singing. Try singing!' So I sang a 'Siping Tune,' and I was spared.'

After Yang finished speaking, he personally tapped the table and sang a song at the banquet before stopping."

Few people know about the misery in the occupied territories today. But in the four northeastern provinces, which fell eight years ago, it has indeed reached the stage of dividing people into four classes. What is strange is that in today's Easternized lands, not only the scholar class is being attacked, but even the working and peasant classes with a slight sense of national identity cannot escape. For example, today the Japanese in the Northeast divide the people of the Northeast into four classes: A, B, C, and D. Class A refers specifically to intellectuals. Class B refers to middle-class people who have surrendered and become puppet officials. Class C is for workers, and Class D is for ignorant farmers. Among these four classes, the most dangerous and least protected are the A class. Not only is this the case in normal times, but on household registration books and travel permits, the three words "Class A People" are clearly printed as a sign of strict prevention. This is the same as the passports of Jews expelled from Germany, which were stamped with "Jew." However, the words "Jew" themselves are not an insult or danger to the Jews themselves, but only an annoying mark. But "Class A People" clearly tell you: "This is an anti-Japanese and anti-Manchukuo ideological offender," and their life will be erased sooner or later. But recently, because of the prevalence of anti-Japanese sentiment and the intensification of X-people's oppression, even Class C and Class D people have mostly embarked on the path of actually resisting and attacking the enemies. For example, the Northeast Volunteer Army, which is rampant in various parts of the Northeast today, is mainly composed of the northeastern peasant and worker masses. This is one example. From this, it can be seen that the oppression of Manchuria in the past was not as fierce as the current torment by the X people.

What is strange is that Yang, a student from Liaoyang, although he once deeply tasted the bitterness of being a slave of a vanquished nation and hated it all his life, in the end he still threw himself into the arms of his master and got a governor to do. He is just a scholar, a petty bourgeois intellectual. In any era and environment, he can get an official position. Although "loss of integrity" is a big deal, "starvation" is also a big deal. This is why in the occupied territories today, only ignorant and uneducated common people are seen rising up and attacking the enemy, while few scholars die for their principles or intellectuals sacrifice themselves. For example, in the vast occupied areas of the Northeast, only Zhao Laotaitai and her son and others destroyed their homes to resist the enemy. There are also the former "Ma Huzi" who occupied the mountains as bandits, uneducated peasants and workers. If someone asks, "Where are the intellectuals?" there is no follow-up. Perhaps those intellectuals are just waiting for the National Army to counterattack! But they are all eating the invaders' feasts, smeared with oil, and becoming instructors or special agents in puppet official positions. A scholar is just a scholar, and it is the same in any society!

For example, recently there are some "plump-faced" people who actually join hands with the enemies to slander the government and the people resisting the invaders. This is truly the ugliest and most shameful thing in the world. If heaven has no justice, and their bird plan is realized, of course they will be officials and nobles again. Scholars are shameless, and it is mostly like this.

The pain of being a conquered nation does not seem to cause any obvious suffering for some people. These people should be sent to the nineteenth level of hell to be slaves of a conquered nation for eternity, never to be able to turn over, as their deserved punishment.

In these days when "selling out the country is not shameful, and traitors are everywhere," those who have never tasted the bitterness of being a slave of a vanquished nation should be vigilant!

### The Era's

— Yuan Shuipai

The era's waves,

Stubborn waves,

Surging,

Roaring,

Heading towards victory,

To the end.

Dropping out halfway,

Is shameful.

The era's waves,

Stern waves,

Surging,

Roaring,

Without leniency,

Striking

The defeatists'

Cat faces.

The era's radiance,

Sharp radiance,

Piercing through

The traitors' disguises,

Iron armor made of paper,

Still custom-made from Tokyo;

Putting it on,

Sending themselves to their funeral!

The era's radiance,

Starlight in the cold night,

Illuminating

Thousands of warriors,

In the plains, mountains.

It is their firm hearts

Lying within each gun barrel.

People at this time have no flesh……

January 9, 1939

### Marching Jottings

— Li Huiying

I was secretly wondering what caused their kind of character and thinking, because it wasn't just Mr. Yu and his son, but all the men there. When you talk to them, they all have a pure neck that is different from the ordinary people, and even the women have their own opinions. This small mountain village is not accessible to culture, and transportation is inconvenient. How could they know so much about things outside? For example, they said:

"More than 20 young people from villages within ten miles of here have gone to school in northern Shaanxi."

Why do they know to run so far to go there, and isn't the young man in front of him saying that he will leave soon? What kind of power is pushing them? There is also a woman who guards a son in two rooms, and also let the child go. The way she talks is not like ordinary women wiping their eyes and shedding tears, but rather a smile floats on her face, as if that matter makes her glorious - what is the reason for this?

Looking at the fields nearby, looking at the high mountains in the distance, I was really troubled that I couldn't understand it myself. In frustration, I said something like: "This area is really a place to fight guerrilla warfare." After I finished speaking, I also pointed to the towering mountain to the east.

"That mountain below is Linjia Dawan, Lin Biao's old home!" People said in unison, looking at them like they were excited, "He is the principal of Anti-Japanese University!"

At this time, Mr. Yu, as a pioneer, stretched out his hand to indicate that area of hills, drew a semicircle, and then explained:

"That area is where the Red Army used to appear. How can it not be a good place to fight guerrilla warfare!" He smiled, "Now, we ordinary people can also talk about these things with you soldiers. Before, we couldn't."

This time, I completely recognized the people in this small village. Influence, ah, influence, it's all because of that aspect that influenced them. According to them, the Red Army first went down the mountain to attack, occupying the village stronghold twice. They accumulated several years of experience, and they also had a new understanding of the Red Army. (To be continued)

### Escape

— Du Wenhui

It was a late autumn night, and the dark sky was still shining with countless stars. Our 913th Regiment headquarters, with more than a thousand brothers, had already set off for the middle section of the Guangzeng Highway - villages near Longyandong - to be stationed.

This hasty march in the middle of the night has made the team feel unusually tired. The advance troops have already made contact in Zengcheng, ninety miles away. The deep sound of cannons is constantly drifting from the night sky, and each of our hearts is constantly beating, disturbed by the unpredictable fate of death. Even if our sleepy eyes have already closed, we are still pricking up our ears, quietly listening to what is happening in the night sky. If there are one or two barks of dogs or some footsteps, we will uneasily open our eyelids and look out of the camp.

The sky has not yet dawned, and a ray of dawn is emerging from the gray sky. We were sleeping soundly in our dreams when we suddenly heard a rattling sound of X-planes in the sky. We hurriedly got up and put on our clothes, and rushed out of the village to the fields and mountains to hide.

"Rumble, rumble..." The sound of explosions began to echo through the earth's space and people's hearts. In the dim dawn, bombs fell like baskets of black eggs. The entire village and the jungle along the highway turned into ashes, all emitting rushing flames!

The bombs not only wanted to level those villages, but also the mountain forests along the highway.

"Kakaka..." The sound of machine guns swept around us. More than a dozen of us desperately climbed up the mountain peak. When we climbed to the top of the mountain, only I, four soldiers, and a staff member named Chen were left.

I looked back and saw that in the distance on the highway, there were already more than a dozen black tanks rushing over, as if they were entering a no-man's land.

The plane was sweeping machine guns overhead, and bullets danced in the wind around us. We desperately ran down the hillside and ran over another mountain. At this moment, I only knew about life, regardless of thorns or shallow pits in front of me, I took the road when I saw it, and climbed the mountain when I saw it. After running for more than two hours, I couldn't hear the sound of the machine guns, and I couldn't see the shadow of the enemy plane.

At this moment, the sky had dawned. The colorful sunlight had shone on our backs, on the haggard valley, and on the hazy sky. The morning light in winter was lovely and bright, and lovely and warm. The six of us sat on a rock in a forest to rest. Everyone's legs were swollen. Our hearts were beating non-stop like ants on a hot pot. The whole night of escape had made our faces pale. Everyone was unwilling to talk, only deep in our hearts were some torrents of grief echoing, and we fell asleep tiredly in the jungle.

The small birds in the forest were chirping and singing lovely little songs on the peeling dead branches, as if to comfort the hardships of us fleeing people.

When we woke up from our sleep, the sun had already set in the west. A golden yellow of the setting sun was softly lying in this green forest. At that time, we felt very hungry. However, where can we find some food in this wild forest? So we decided to move towards Guangzhou again.

When we were about to reach the boundary of Henan, it was already dusk. Looking from afar, Guangzhou and Henan were emitting rushing flames, and black and white smoke was filling the entire space. We knew that the X army had entered Guangzhou. If we move forward again, we will definitely encounter danger. In the absence of a solution, we had no choice but to run to Foshan while enduring hunger.

We completely threw our guns in the wilderness. We ran all the way from Xiaogang to Foshan in the dark night. After a night of constant running, we finally arrived in Foshan when the east turned white. Several of us rented a room, ate breakfast in the town, and ran back to the hotel to sleep. That night, the four soldiers parted ways and went home. Only I and the staff member Chen stayed there.

The next morning. Chen and I set off to leave Foshan for Macau. On the road from Foshan to Guanshan, several bandits holding pistols robbed us. Our money was all searched. Fortunately, the five silver dollars in my shoes were not searched, otherwise we would have starved to death on the road.

After many hardships and difficulties, we finally arrived in Macau, found a relative, borrowed 20 dollars, and escaped back to Hong Kong.

In these ten days of wandering, hunger, and fleeing, it was the most unforgettable page in my life history. The cruel behavior of the X-people is something I will never forget! One day, I will swear to avenge this!

### Beware of the Enemy's Divisive Tactics

— Jing Cheng

In the newspapers of the enemy and the traitors, there is constant propaganda about shameless and absurd "anti-communist theories" – this is the most self-satisfied cover-up used by the traitors and their masters. Of course, this cover-up cannot deceive the Chinese people who have 18 months of experience in resisting the enemies - good men who have grown up in this world. However, there are still some stupid fools who have been fooled and are following the monsters to talk nonsense, saying a lot of inappropriate things such as "disbanding the Communist Party, abolishing the border areas, reorganizing the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army." This is completely the enemy's divisive tactic of using traitors. They didn't even look at whether the existence of the Communist Party, the existence of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area and the Hebei-Shanxi border area, and the existence of the Eighth Route Army have helped the war of resistance against the enemy or hindered it over the past 18 months? Hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members are engaged in the most arduous anti-enemy activities in the enemy's rear. Hundreds of thousands of armed forces are under the leadership of the cadres of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, containing hundreds of thousands of the enemy's troops, and firmly holding on to the base areas in the enemy's rear without retreating. In the administrative work of the border areas, whether it is the universality and improvement of the democratic system, the implementation of mass anti-enemy education, arming the masses, or mobilizing the masses, all have played a model role in the country. Only the blind and the deaf do not know that there are such iron facts. These facts, could they be used as a reason to disband and abolish these organizations? Even the Japanese warlords cannot but admit that the existence of these organizations is the greatest threat to them. Why should we remove these threats for the enemies? I really don't understand why these people always have such free time and strange intentions to calculate these meaningless old accounts?

However, those things are always the easiest to distinguish. The enemy's anti-propaganda cannot deceive anyone for a long time. If you still don't believe it, then please look at two different news items published in the newspaper a few days ago at the same time: just when Peng Dehuai, the deputy commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, visited Chairman Chiang to ask for instructions and rushed back to the Shanxi front to participate in the victory celebration meeting of the soldiers and civilians in Shanxi, the new traitors who advocated anti-communism were secretly meeting with Japanese representatives.

In this year of ever-changing, hypocritical, and deceptive times, it is still necessary to be careful: recognize the facts more, believe the rumors less; not to mention political vision, in short, this is also the duty of being a human being.
