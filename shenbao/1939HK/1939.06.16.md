### A New Stage in the Far Eastern International Situation

The Tianjin Japanese military police, beginning on the morning of the 14th of this month, blockaded the British and French concessions, coercing the British and French authorities to accept their unreasonable demands. The seriousness of this situation cannot simply be regarded as a "reproduction" of the Gulangyu landing incident, but it also concerns the entire existence of European and American powers in the Far East. If Britain and France once again show submission to Japan and accept unreasonable demands, then Japan's aggressive ambitions to encroach on the Far Eastern interests of the powers will become even more rampant, and not only will China's door be completely closed, but the entire Asia will also become Japan's sole sphere of dominance, thereby realizing the "conquest of the world" in Tanaka Giichi's memorial!

However, Japan's recent brutal behavior should not be seen as a "provocation" against the European and American powers, but rather as a political and diplomatic offensive, a conspiracy to rescue itself from the difficulties it has encountered in its military invasion of China. As the London Daily Telegraph stated on the 14th: "Japan has repeatedly created incidents, seemingly with a fixed purpose. The reason for this is that Japan's attempt to conquer China is progressing slowly. Not only does Japan know this, but the Chinese also know it. In order to save face, Japan does not hesitate to arbitrarily destroy the interests of third countries as a means. This should not be regarded as Japan's strength, but rather as Japan's weakness and incompetence."

It is precisely because the foundation of the Japanese's violence lies in its own "weakness and incompetence," that even in these speculative, opportunistic, risky, and intimidating actions, it constantly and everywhere demonstrates its strategy of avoiding strength and attacking weakness: It provokes Outer Mongolia, but when Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov mentioned in his diplomatic speech that "the Soviet Union's determination to defend Outer Mongolia is no different from the Soviet border," Japan immediately lowered its flag, silenced its drums, and quietly retreated; it provokes the European and American powers, such as the Gulangyu incident and the blockade of the Tianjin concessions, but its target is concentrated on the most easily compromised Britain, while expressing that it has no hostility toward the United States.

Although Japan's conspiracy has become a universally seen fact. At present, the British people and national public opinion have enthusiastically and unanimously demanded a tough stance against Japan, and the United States and France have also clearly expressed their willingness to cooperate effectively in dealing with the Far Eastern incident. The Soviet Union was the first to call on Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to jointly aid China, and insisted in the Anglo-Soviet negotiations that the anti-aggression front should include the Far East. We Chinese, have also factually demonstrated that not only can we defend our country's survival and independence through resistance, but we have also been resisting the common enemy for the sake of Britain, the United States, and France for almost two years! The current question is: Are Britain, the United States, and France willing to succumb to Japan's speculative, opportunistic, risky, and intimidating actions, and withdraw from China and the Far East one after another? Or will they take collective action to give Japan an appropriate and necessary lesson, and obtain honorable and genuine peace? The former is destruction, while the latter is the only way out.

At present, China and the Soviet Union go without saying, the United States, France, and other countries are also striving to promote all countries to embark on the path of aiding China and containing Japan. According to a telegram on the 14th, the US House Foreign Affairs Committee has unanimously passed a partial amendment to the Neutrality Act, abolishing the arms embargo, and the State Department unanimously advocated actively promoting anti-aggression actions when reviewing its Far Eastern policy. The same day's telegram also stated that Anglo-French cooperation is about to extend to the Far East, and the two countries' Far Eastern military leaders have left for Singapore today to hold a military conference to discuss the implementation of Far Eastern military cooperation. In addition, it is rumored that the Soviet fleet will also hold a large-scale Pacific exercise within days.

China's heroic resistance over the past two years has exposed the Japanese aggressors' "weakness and incompetence" and has greatly changed the international situation, and anti-aggression actions have, in fact, gradually expanded to the Far East as mentioned above! Let the Tianjin incident completely shatter the democratic countries' policy of compromise! Let the Tianjin incident serve as the basis for establishing an anti-aggression front in the Far East! Let the Japanese aggressors use the action of blockading the Tianjin concessions to dig their own graves!

### Guidance Methods for Wartime Education

— Zeming

(1) Cultivating New Morality in Students

The new morality we are talking about refers to the various good qualities that anti-Japanese warriors should possess and the various good qualities that builders of the Three Principles of the People's New China should possess. Anti-Japanese warriors and builders of the New China must have a sound national consciousness and a spirit of collectivism. It is not enough to have this consciousness and spirit; they must also have the various qualities of fighting for national and collective interests, not fearing sacrifice, and being mutually helpful and autonomous.

The old moral education can be divided into two aspects. One aspect is that it ignored politics, or it can be said that it was detached from politics, and only considered morality. It was believed that moral education alone, cultivating each person's public and private virtues very well, could make China revive. The other aspect is that this kind of "moral education" actually represented the political ideology of the ruling class, but it deliberately concealed its own political face, not letting others know its true purpose. For example, many schools (in the occupied areas) opened under the direction of Japanese imperialism, studying the Five Classics and Four Books, which was clearly manufacturing slaves in order to achieve its long-term rule over China, but it was still promoting "seeking happiness for the Chinese people"? It was still propagating that it "has no political purpose"?

For these old moral educations, we must mercilessly expose its true face, widely disseminate its sins, and give it a fatal blow so that it cannot continue to exist. The cultivation of the new morality of the anti-Japanese education does not conceal its own political face, but rather selects the most correct political requirements as its guidance goals.

(2) Past Moral Education Only Focused on Bookish and Verbal Guidance

Talking about morality on paper, explaining it logically and systematically, but unfortunately it was just talking and saying. The people who said it were unwilling to do it themselves, and the people who listened were just listening. In the past, principals, professors, and teachers always liked to say "brightness, uprightness, grandeur, and beauty" to students, but they themselves were doing all kinds of improper things; in the past, officials and masters always said good and beautiful words such as "honesty, impartiality, love for the people, and responsibility," but they were accepting bribes, selling the law, and colluding with local bullies to oppress good people. How can this kind of contradiction between words and deeds make people follow them? Therefore, the past moral education was just an old, unsalable cliché.

The new morality needed now is not empty talk but the expression of practice, and the new morality only exists in practical action. If national consciousness is not expressed in direct or indirect anti-Japanese actions, if the spirit of collectivism is not expressed in the spirit of collectivism, if sacrifice and courage are not expressed in giving up the ego and struggling to fight for national interests and collective happiness, then so-called national consciousness, spirit of collectivism, sacrifice and struggle...etc. are all empty; new morality is only expressed in practical behavior, and only in behavior can your character be seen. The new morality that anti-Japanese education guides and cultivates is like this.

3. The difference between the past school guidance methods and the anti-war education misleading methods

In the past, schools adopted a policy of high pressure to guide students, making students unable to move or dare to move: the school authorities formulated very strict school rules, using severe punishments as a means to force students to obey, in order to cultivate students' blind obedience habits and slavishness, just like imperialism forcing the people of colonies to obey the laws promulgated by the colonial government.

Anti-Japanese education wants to oppose the guidance method of high-pressure policy, because we do not want to be slaves to a fallen country, so we also oppose training docile people like sheep; what we need now are soldiers with initiative and autonomy, only such soldiers can defeat Japan and build a new China. Such soldiers can never be cultivated by guidance methods that adopt a high-pressure policy.

Some people say: "Anti-Japanese education opposes high-pressure policies, which means that students are not required to obey discipline." On the contrary, we require all aspects of students' lives to be disciplined. The discipline of life is absolutely necessary, but the method of maintaining discipline is for students to formulate their own life covenants and implement them themselves. Hold meetings and discuss; try to make this covenant understood by every student, so that every student feels that this covenant meets their own requirements, and everyone consciously and voluntarily abides by this covenant, so that the students can cultivate the habit and ability of self-awareness and autonomy.

With a life covenant, it still cannot be guaranteed that no one will violate the life covenant. Individual backward elements will sometimes violate it. Violators of the life covenant should be sanctioned, but this sanction is not to be carried out by a certain person or the school authorities, but by a group. Such sanctions are also different from past sanctions. Past sanctions were only passive punishments. Minor offenses were recorded, and serious offenses were expelled. Students suffered such severe punishment and did not know why. Anti-Japanese education advocates active obedience, so that the offender understands his mistakes, admits his mistakes, and resolves to correct his mistakes. The collective sanctions we advocate are not for everyone to attack him but to help him, to help him correct his mistakes and become a more active and sound anti-Japanese cadre.

(4) Group Competition is an Effective Method to Promote Students' Disciplined Life

How to conduct group competition? That is, within a certain period, overcoming a certain obvious common weakness as the goal of the competition. For example, the lives of ordinary students are more scattered now, so we should concentrate our efforts to overcome this weakness. When formulating competition covenants, we should aim at the common weaknesses of each period and hold competitions between classes and groups. Each competition unit should formulate its own competition plan. After extensive and in-depth discussions by the people participating in the competition, everyone believes that it is very appropriate, and then make a decision. After the decision, everyone should strive to complete the plan, exceed the plan, and strive for victory.

Group competition has two benefits. Because the competition is collective, not individual, so to win, every member of this group must be very sound, so advanced members must help backward members, and backward members must quickly catch up with advanced members, so the spirit of mutual help is greatly promoted. This is one. The competition covenant is formulated by the students themselves and implemented by the students themselves. In order to win, they must manage themselves, so they can train students' autonomy ability. This is two.

(5) Self-Criticism is a Weapon for Seeking Progress

Whether it is a group or an individual, shortcomings are inevitable in the work process. A person or a group wants to have no shortcomings, unless it does not work. The question is not whether there are shortcomings, but whether you are willing to overcome shortcomings. Don't be afraid of having shortcomings, just be afraid of not being willing to overcome shortcomings. If you have shortcomings and are willing to honestly admit them and resolve to overcome them, then you can slowly overcome the shortcomings and make yourself progress. If a person has shortcomings and overcomes them, then this person can continue to progress. One's own shortcomings are often invisible to oneself, and others need to criticize and guide them, so it is necessary to hold regular life review meetings. Life review meetings should stipulate a certain time for eating, and the work or life of each person should be reviewed in detail at the meeting. First of all, it should be self-criticism, and then mutual criticism by others. Criticism must be specific, pointing out the shortcomings, where these shortcomings are expressed, what harm these shortcomings have on the work, and how to overcome them. During the discussion, everyone should try their best to express their opinions.

Life review meetings can not only help a person overcome those shortcomings, but also learn lessons at this meeting. Everyone can understand these shortcomings based on the mistakes made by others, so as not to repeat these shortcomings.

How to ensure that the shortcomings that have been criticized can be overcome? A strict inspection system must be established, that is, the degree of implementation of the resolutions of the previous meeting should be strictly checked at each meeting, whether each person has corrected the shortcomings they have admitted, and if they have not been corrected, whether there are any difficulties. If there are difficulties, specific methods to solve the difficulties should be discussed. At the same time, everyone should pay attention to helping him overcome his shortcomings in daily life.

Self-criticism should not only criticize shortcomings, but also promote strengths. The excellent achievements of a person or a group, the exemplary style in life and work, should also be promoted, on the one hand, to encourage the continued promotion of strengths, and at the same time to allow others to learn various strengths.

In short, holding review meetings at all times, reviewing the degree of implementation of the work, criticizing shortcomings and promoting strengths, can promote the progress of individuals or groups and make the work completed quickly.

6. The Relationship Between Teachers and Students Should be Close and Respectful

In the past, schools adopted high-pressure policies towards students, so in the past, students were outwardly respectful to teachers but secretly opposed them, and even openly opposed them. Teachers of anti-Japanese education should not make students afraid but should make students respect, should not make students hate but should make students love, help him correct students' mistakes; also help him promote students' strengths. This is not a laissez-faire doctrine, a package-handling doctrine, nor is it doing work for students, but living with students, learning together, working together, and overcoming difficulties together in practical work, promoting strengths, so that teachers and students understand each other, make progress with each other, and respect and love each other.

### The Min Ge She Reporter, Li Zhuang: Please Look at Today's Tianjin and Beiping - A Contrast of Darkness and Light - Part 2

2. Thus is Beiping

Because Beiping is the location of the puppet government, on the surface it still seems very stable. Inside the city, one can hardly see any wartime atmosphere. However, this stability is ultimately false, and at night, one can often hear the clear sound of gunfire from the nearby suburbs.

Merchants in general are constantly complaining, because of the exorbitant taxes and sluggish business. Selling goods becomes more of a loss-making venture each day, but the cruel and unreasonable [Japanese] army also oppressively doesn't allow you to simply close shop. In the past, [Japanese] soldiers ran wildly through the streets, grabbing things without paying. The Hengdeli Clock and Watch Shop once suffered a great loss because of this. This is just one example among many incidents. In order to implement their deceiving, anesthetizing, and hypocritical political conspiracy, the [Japanese] "Beiping Garrison Commander" used the excuse of preserving international image, and ordered a strict prohibition of such illegal behavior. The recklessly rampant "Imperial Army" roaming the streets are now somewhat fewer in number, and they do give some money when they buy things, but the money they give is counterfeit, and they give at most eighty cents for something worth one dollar.

Bombings do not occur frequently within Beiping, mainly because the inspections upon entering the city are too strict. At the city gates, there are always three Japanese soldiers stationed, fully armed. One Chinese policeman only carries a metal knife. When entering the city gate, one must undergo a rigorous inspection. Staying in a hotel involves being checked an unknown number of times a night. Generally speaking, checks are more lenient in large hotels and stricter in smaller ones.

No matter how much the [Japanese] exaggerate and tout prosperity and recovery, in reality, business declines every day. The [Japanese] have systematically and methodically monopolized the trade of leather, wool, and hemp – three commodities related to military affairs. However, because of the active guerrillas in the surrounding areas, they cannot profit from this, and Chinese stores dealing in these commodities have had to close down. Other stores also have few visitors, in a state of desolation that is distressing to witness.

However, there are also abnormal phenomena amid the general trends, as can be seen in the abnormal prosperity of hotels and restaurants. Generally, remnants of the dying feudal system and insane traitors flock to the capital to seek official positions. They squander the wealth plundered from the people, indulging in lavish extravagance.

Government officials do not easily dare to come out, and spend their days hiding in small houses and safes as if under house arrest. They themselves know that traitors are public enemies and anyone is entitled to kill them.

Many middle schools and elementary schools have opened under the bayonets of the [Japanese], and the curriculum is filled with things like the divine might of the "Imperial Army" and a "paradise under benevolent rule"... Higher education institutions, such as Peking University, have been restored by the [Japanese], and they have also established the New People's College, a traitor-manufacturing institution. However, no matter how much the [Japanese] promote and reward it, there are still very few students seeking admission. Missionary schools, such as Yenching University, are still barely operating, and although they have foreign flags, they still cannot avoid the oppression and destruction of the [Japanese]. The number of students is also decreasing day by day.

There are several types of traitor newspapers, which all day long trumpet things like the heroism of the "Imperial Army" and the annihilation of the Party's army. However, if the people whose eyes have been covered by the [Japanese] pay attention to deduction, they can still glean some truth from the lines of text that the [Japanese] have not noticed or could not avoid. A traitor newspaper published the following news item: "The people of Liaoxian, under the command of the about-to-be-defeated anti-Japanese government and the Communist army, emptied the city, carrying away all livestock, causing the Imperial Army great difficulty in obtaining food and drink, and the roads were mostly destroyed, making troop movements extremely inconvenient."

The general price level has increased by one-third compared to before the war. Some things are simply not available—such as items related to military supplies. Western goods are more expensive, while Japanese goods are cheaper, mainly because imported Japanese goods are almost tax-free.

The general populace is angry but dare not speak out. Their sentiments for national salvation are generally very high. They hope all day long that the National Army can strike Beiping soon. Although they suffer severe persecution and prohibition, they still receive some true news of the resistance against Japan in educational institutions. Many people have radios, and those who don't have radios often exchange "information." They are completely clear that the [Japanese] rule cannot extend beyond the range of artillery, and they all believe that the final victory will definitely be ours. In the nearby western suburbs, our guerrillas are constantly active. In counties farther from Beiping, the [Japanese] control is naturally even weaker, to the point of being non-existent. The puppet "Zhili Provincial Governor" Gao Lingxiao once shamelessly uttered the lament of "no province to govern."

3. The "Royal Collaboration Army" Also Helps Us

Because the [Japanese] have very few troops, they mostly rely on the strength of the Royal Collaboration Army to govern. However, this kind of force is unreliable. The [Japanese] themselves seem to know this, so from beginning to end, they only put them in less important places to be responsible for "guarding." In a certain place not far from Beiping, there is a Royal Collaboration Army stationed. This regiment of the Royal Collaboration Army once made a "non-aggression pact" with our certain army. They supply the certain army with two boxes of ammunition every day, and when the certain army destroys roads or telephone poles, they cannot come out to interfere.

The situation is probably beyond the [Japanese] expectations. Many Royal Collaboration Army soldiers often give us a lot of help, such as supplying ammunition and purchasing important military supplies on our behalf. Once, nineteen members of our certain army in plainclothes were stopped by sentries of the Imperial Army, but these nineteen brave members of the certain army, without any fear, lectured them at length on the great principles of being human. Perhaps these Royal Collaboration Army soldiers discovered a bit of conscience at that time, and let these dozen or so people go without harming them in the slightest.

4. The Sinful Tianjin

From Beiping to Tianjin, there are three passenger trains running day and night. Two during the day, and one at night, but that nighttime train is almost entirely empty, because no one dares to risk the expected danger of "nine derailments out of ten trips."

The [Japanese] are even more licentious and shameless in Tianjin than in Beiping, but we also have a greater hidden strength in Tianjin than in Beiping.

First of all, prices in Tianjin are similar to those in Beiping, up thirty percent from before the incident. European and American goods are scarce and expensive, while Japanese goods are plentiful and cheap.

Anyone who sees Tianjin now will say, "It's getting worse every day." Indeed, the larger businesses are completely monopolized by the [Japanese]. Most Japanese goods are directly shipped to other counties through Japanese trading houses. Chinese shops, on the one hand, are suffering from sluggish business, and on the other hand, are under the high pressure of exorbitant taxes and heavy levies. How can they not decline day by day? But in order to "beautify the city," you are not allowed to simply "close down."

The [Japanese] army in Tianjin is more reckless than in Beiping. Most of the major intersections are guarded by sandbags and well-armed Japanese soldiers. But despite the [Japanese] heightened vigilance, our guerrillas still break into the [Japanese] security lines from time to time. Bombing incidents in the city are common. On the twenty-third day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar last year, a movie theater in the Japanese concession publicly screened a film insulting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. But soon after the screening began, someone threw in a bomb, resulting in fourteen deaths and injuries. The brave man who threw the bomb safely escaped. At the Zhongyuan Company, on the streetcar... bomb cases occur from time to time.

The [Japanese] are trying every possible means to destroy the legal currency, so they have repeatedly ordered either to exchange the legal currency for counterfeit money by a certain date, or that no one may carry more than one hundred yuan of legal currency by a certain date. However, only the devils obey these ridiculous orders. The credibility of the legal currency has instead become more stable because of the [Japanese] attempts to undermine it. In the British and French concessions, our legal currency banks still exist, and people can exchange damaged legal currency at any time. The ratio of legal currency to counterfeit money in the British and French concessions is nine to ten—counterfeit money is not very common in the concessions. In the Japanese concession, the ratio is reversed, ten to nine. In Hebei—Chinese territory—the ratio is ten to ten. However, generally larger businesses hide all their legal currency and spend the counterfeit money first. Therefore, the counterfeit money, which is not very numerous, is now scorned and flies around everywhere. Whoever gets it has a headache. In reality, one unit of legal currency can buy much more than one unit of counterfeit money.

There are very many counterfeit banknotes that can be seen in Tianjin. Counterfeit banknotes from the "China United Reserve Bank," the Bank of Korea, and the Bank of Manchuria are all circulating in Tianjin, but their scope of circulation and credibility are far inferior to our legal currency and the Hebei Provincial banknotes. Because the [Japanese] saw that the credibility of our legal currency was unshakably stable, they recently massively counterfeited it, exchanging it with traitors at a rate of thirty yuan of genuine legal currency for one hundred yuan of fake legal currency, and the traitors took it to the market to thoroughly disrupt it.

There are very many traitor newspapers, the larger ones being the Yong Bao, Xin Tianjin Bao, and Manchuria Bao and the Korean Daily Newspaper. The editors of these newspapers are simply not human; they shamelessly call our troops the "Bandit Army." Very few people read these newspapers. If there are any, they are just a few pitiful merchants, but they read these newspapers not for the monotonous "Imperial Army advances on somewhere" or "the Party's army is completely annihilated," but to glean some "commercial information that is closely related to their interests." These newspapers also have so-called "supplements." Their "supplements" are filled with things like "How such-and-such model has sex."

Our newspapers circulate in the British and French concessions. Often, one person reads it in the concession and then returns to recite it to many people. The [Japanese] check people going to the British concession very strictly: they have laid dense layers of electric wire along the river, so people going to the concession have to go through the French bridge. Many unlucky people sometimes wait from early morning until midday and still cannot get through. The [Japanese]' own explanation for this behavior is that a large number of such-and-such army are hiding in such-and-such concession, and that certain army is constantly plotting to disrupt order.

The morale of the people of Tianjin is very high. This phenomenon can be seen from the bombing incidents that occur from time to time. They long for their own troops, their own planes, but in the sky often fly the Fascist iron eagles painted with poultice marks that give them headaches. But in the deep of night, one often hears the gunfire of our guerrillas, which is the most exciting thing.

In Tianjin, many good people often disappear and are arrested for unknown reasons.

Beijing opera and "Bangzi" have mostly been fully restored, and their wonderful programs are things like "San Niang Teaches Her Son," "Zun Long Steals the Phoenix," and "Biography of a Virtuous Woman." Several movie theaters have also reopened, and their content is nothing more than "Annihilation of such-and-such army" and "Thighs," etc. However, movie theaters do not seem to be as thriving as Beijing opera theaters, probably because bomb cases often occur in movie theaters.

The Japanese concession has vividly become a den of demons. At dusk, every household broadcasts lewd noises and lascivious melodies that are fit only to pollute one's ears. Opium dens, gambling arenas, brothels, dance halls, massage parlors... are in addition to the manufacturing facilities for white powder, counterfeit money, peaceful atmosphere, and traitors. The streets are plastered with advertisements for "Sex Disease Treatment," "Aphrodisiac Pills," "Gonorrhea Cured in One Day," that make one want to vomit. Most of the brothels and gambling dens are run by Koreans, protected and assisted by the Japanese. The manufacturing facilities for traitors and counterfeit currency are all operated by Japanese intelligence agencies.

Talking is very difficult in Tianjin, because you don't know who is a traitor. Many traitors often pretend to be united against the common enemy in order to trick you into saying what Chinese people should say, and then pull out a pistol and kidnap you to the Japanese concession.

The [Japanese] rule is very weak. In addition to our guerrillas operating in the surrounding suburbs, they also send plainclothes teams to operate in the urban areas from time to time, often causing the [Japanese] to panic and make a fool of themselves. Once, at a crossroads in Hebei, a volley of handguns suddenly sounded, which caused the Tianjin [Japanese] army to mobilize in full force, the Japanese concession was immediately under martial law, and heavy machine guns and small cannons were set up. However, the plainclothes team that fired the shots casually withdrew. A few bullets caused thousands of [Japanese] people to not sleep well all night.

Not only are the [Japanese] unable to rule us, but serious cracks often appear within the [Japanese] themselves. In the tenth month of the lunar calendar last year, such a thing happened:

The [Japanese] Navy stationed in Tianjin was ordered to return home for rest, but encountered strong opposition from the [Japanese] Army stationed in Tianjin, because these Army troops were all transferred from outside the customs, and had not returned home for several years. The treatment of the Navy and Army seemed too unequal. As a result, the two sides had an armed conflict, fighting fiercely for a day and night. The number of dead and wounded totaled more than two hundred people. Later, the war was quelled through the mediation and efforts of the consuls of various countries and the rebuke of the authorities on both sides of the Navy and Army. Also, the mutiny of the Japanese army at Dagu Port that occurred not long ago can also be seen as a good example of the internal division of the [Japanese] army.

5. Coda

These two major cities in North China, Beiping and Tianjin, are now indeed full of bloodshed and filth, massacre and terror. However, given our insistence on a protracted war of resistance and our determination not to stop until the final victory, given the increasingly favorable international situation, and given the increasingly surging anti-war movement within [Japanese] , we believe—firmly believe—that in the near future, they—Beiping and Tianjin—will surely once again be covered with the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun, and see the light of day again.

### The Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region Shatters the [Japanese] Encirclement

[Min Ge She Correspondent's Manuscript] The director of the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region, Hu Meiting, and the director of the Department of Education, Liu Ding'an, came to Lan on the twenty-second day of the previous month. In addition to launching a warm welcome party on the twenty-third, the War Mobilization Association also held a tea party on the evening of the twenty-fourth. At this meeting, comrades Hu and Liu explained in detail the financial and trade policies of the border region, as well as the process of how they recently shattered the [Japanese] encirclement. The latter is recorded below:

"The Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region has given the [Japanese] a severe blow in terms of military, politics, and economy, causing the [Japanese] to harbor resentment and constantly want to 'annihilate' it in one fell swoop. Last August, the [Japanese] planned to transfer four divisions to encircle the border region, but later, due to insufficient troops, they only transferred two divisions, about 50,000 people. Before taking action, they sent a large number of trained traitors to infiltrate the border region. The border region government had already noticed this. In early October, the [Japanese] began a ten-pronged encirclement, with one prong each from Dingxiang, Daixian, Fanshi, Lingqiu, Weixian, Ziyuan, and Baoding. In addition, they attacked PingShang from Shijiazhuang, and Mengxian from the Zhengtai Railway. The [Japanese] had sufficient troops and supplies for this attack, so it was estimated that the [Japanese] would hold several strongholds and at the same time connect these strongholds. Wutai Mountain would become a guerrilla zone. Based on this estimate, they implemented a policy of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, and transferred the main organs to different areas. At that time, our army, being outnumbered, would definitely suffer if fighting on all sides, so it was decided to loosen the north and south and concentrate firepower to deal with the east and west. The [Japanese]' military weakness is 'rigid adherence to orders and lack of maneuverability.' They were ordered to converge on Wutai Mountain. We seized on this weakness of the [Japanese] and thoroughly strengthened the walls and cleared the fields on the road to Wutai Mountain, trapping the [Japanese]. Our army first attacked the main force from Quyang to Fuping. Of the thousand or so [Japanese] troops, five hundred were wiped out. Later, the [Japanese] reinforced with three thousand troops, so our army abandoned Fuping. After some work of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, only [Japanese] military slogans remained in the streets and alleys of Fuping. As a result, although the [Japanese] occupied Fuping, supplies had to come from the rear. Our army then specialized in attacking the [Japanese] supplies, forcing the [Japanese] to retreat due to supply difficulties. Our army estimated that the vast [Japanese] army would retreat, so it implemented ambushes and tail attacks, inflicting heavy losses on the [Japanese]. At that time, only a few hundred [Japanese] were left to defend Fuping, and our army launched a surprise attack on them. They broke through and fled, and our army and the people shouted and chased after them, killing more than half of the [Japanese]. On the western front, our army was hiding around Wutai Mountain in advance. After the [Japanese] advanced to Wutai Mountain, most of them withdrew back to the city. Several hundred [Japanese] once came out to intercept and attack our troops stationed at Hekou, gaining considerable advantage and returning triumphantly. While passing through the strategic area of Shipenkou, they were ambushed by us and completely annihilated, with only a few people escaping. The [Japanese] on the north and south roads were originally meant to coordinate. The [Japanese] on the north road had already been defeated. The [Japanese] on the south road came from Mengxian, an isolated army of about a thousand people. After arriving at Wutai Mountain, they were surrounded by us. This entire force was made up of Japanese soldiers. Because of their superior weapons, they could not be completely wiped out. After being surrounded for more than a week, they automatically withdrew, with hundreds of deaths and the death of one commander. This time, the [Japanese] siege was defeated due to the correct use of our guerrilla tactics and the coordination of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields! Now, only a few people remain in Wutai, Hebian, Dongye, and other places!"

This piece of fact tells us that as long as we correctly use guerrilla tactics and coordinate with the strength of the people, the ferocious [Japanese] can be easily wiped out. We should learn this precious lesson!

### Our Great Army Controls Southwestern Shanxi, Putting Us in an Advantageous Position in the Overall War Situation; Enemy Aircraft Losses Excessive, Morale Declining

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] Each battle strengthens our army's ability to resist the war. Therefore, the enemy's offensives in various places have failed. Currently, the overall situation is advantageous to us. Most of the enemy reinforcements in various places recently are Taiwanese, Koreans, and puppet troops. Moreover, they are patching up shortages, so the new additions are limited. Because of the difficulty in making military progress, the enemy is using aircraft to disrupt our rear areas. According to investigations of their main base in Hankou, enemy aircraft stationed there have been shot down by us in various places recently, resulting in heavy losses. Now, the enemy's morale is increasingly declining, and the period of our final victory is near.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to reports, fierce fighting continues in the southeastern part of Shandong. We are taking advantage of the terrain in the Mengyin and Yishui areas to continue attacking the enemy, launching large-scale guerrilla warfare. The enemy's rear outposts are frequently attacked by us, and railways and highways are frequently destroyed by us. Their invasion plan has completely failed.

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 14th Dispatch] The enemy troops that retreated from Jinxi to Lishi and Zhongyang are now under the control of our great army. There are no enemy traces near the Yellow River bank. Fighting remains fierce in southern Shanxi. The enemy's main force is concentrated in Ruicheng and Fenglingdu, seemingly attempting to cross the river. We are making efforts to drive them away.

Progress on All Fronts in Shanxi Province

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to reliable Chinese sources, the Chinese army in southern Shanxi, after recovering Pinglu Maojindu some days ago, is now advancing northward. Anyi on the Tongpu Railway is being defended by the Japanese army, which has suffered heavy losses and been forced to retreat there, attempting to maintain control of the town. Anyi is a key military location on the Tongpu Railway. As for Lishi on the western Shanxi front, it remains a target of the Chinese army's offensive. According to other sources, the southern Chinese army has advanced to Zhongyang, very close to the city, and within range of the Chinese army's artillery. Considering the overall situation, although the battles on this front are considered secondary, they are sufficient to crush any further attempts by the Japanese army to advance deeper. Moreover, by implementing mobile warfare strategies and surprise attacks, the Japanese side has suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army south of Yueyang in northern Hunan is also using these strategies, achieving similar results. As for the Qianjiang front, the fighting is calm, it is said.

At the same time, six to seven hundred enemy troops from Tumen invaded westward through Hongliangou (south of Tumen), and another unit of more than two hundred troops from Huadongsi (south of Tumen) attempted a large-scale westward offensive. Our forces on all fronts have engaged them, and in a confused battle that lasted until 2 p.m., we seized the opportunity to recover strongholds such as Nanwanli and Jianzipo.

This was the first brave act since Hangzhou fell. Residents of Hangzhou, although living in a dangerous city, were all pleasantly surprised. The enemy troops were thrown into a panic. The situation in Hangzhou is now extremely tense. A curfew is imposed every day at 5 p.m., and gunfire is frequent and dense throughout the night.

### The Tingkeler Beating Death Case: The Responsibility Lies Entirely with the Japanese Side; Most of the Japanese Propaganda is Fabricated; Preliminary Hearing Results from the British Consular Court

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th Dispatch] Tingkeler, a British employee of the British-owned Lun Chang Company, was recently killed by Japanese soldiers. The British Consular Court here specially opened a trial this morning for this case. The result of the trial showed that when Tingkeler fired his gun, his target was neither Japanese nor Chinese. According to Franklin, a witness present at the time, when Tingkeler struggled with a Japanese sailor, he aimed his pistol at the ground and deliberately avoided the Japanese and Chinese people present. Three other British employees of Lun Chang Company, Carterwick, Prokos, and Scott, tried to persuade Tingkeler to take a more reasonable approach to the matter, but the Japanese soldiers still insulted and beat Tingkeler with wooden sticks, pistols, and bayonets. I witnessed Tingkeler being knocked to the ground, but the soldiers continued to humiliate and beat him, forcing him to drag forward for thirty yards, causing Tingkeler to bleed profusely. When Tingkeler fired his gun, he did not aim at the Japanese sailors. According to Dr. Konak, when I arrived in Pudong, I saw that Tingkeler's injuries were extremely serious, his hands were cold, and his pulse had almost stopped. However, if surgery could have been performed earlier, there would have been a great hope of recovery.

A Brief Commentary

### Diocesan Boys' School Student Unrest

The Diocesan Boys' School student unrest has been widely reported in various newspapers, and those concerned about education in Hong Kong are paying serious attention to it.

The cause of this student unrest was the students' opposition to a Japanese student named Peng being the head prefect. ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××. To be fair, if students really want to interfere with school administration, they would never be willing to merely walk out passively. Moreover, students consider studying their primary duty, and if they have free time after class, they are eager to have proper entertainment. Why bother—and why is it necessary—to interfere with school administration? For students to abandon their studies and be in conflict with the school authorities they are close to, ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××, therefore, we believe that the occurrence of this Diocesan Boys' School student unrest; the students' painful departure is close to what the ancients called "direct remonstrance." It is definitely not permissible—and we cannot bear—to add the great crime of "interfering with school administration."

According to repeated statements from the Diocesan Boys' School authorities, they have always expressed sympathy for China's resistance against Japan. Even a person of a hostile nationality has such sentiments, ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××; as long as we acknowledge that the departure of the Diocesan Boys' School students is not an interference with school administration but simply a natural expression of patriotism, we can conclude that the solution to this matter is extremely simple: the school authorities and the departing students, based on their usual teacher-student relationship, should have a sincere discussion. On the one hand, the school should voluntarily replace the head prefect, and on the other hand, the departing students should voluntarily resume classes. ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××, we should use the method of "cutting the Gordian knot quickly" to resolve the matter once and for all. We foresee that after the unrest subsides, the relationship between Diocesan Boys' School teachers and students will be even deeper than before!

### An Assassination Case in the French Concession of Shanghai

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th Dispatch] According to news from Shanghai, an assassination case occurred at No. 3 Dasheng Lane, Taurfeis Road in the French Concession on the morning of the 14th. The victims were Sichuanese Li Tianzhu and his wife Xu Yuanzhen. Xu died on the spot, and Li was seriously injured. He was sent to the Guangci Hospital for treatment, and his life is in danger.

### Jardine Matheson Property Occupied

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 15th Dispatch] On Thursday morning, Japanese troops were dispatched to occupy the premises of the British-owned Jardine Matheson Company.

This company is the second largest British trading house in the Far East.

### A Certain Party Bribes Thugs, Plotting to Storm into the British Concession in Tianjin; British Troops Rush to the Scene to Stop Them; Japanese Reservists to Enter the Concession to Demonstrate, it is Said

[Reuters, Tianjin, 15th Dispatch] On the second day of the blockade of the Tianjin Concession, several agitators gathered two thousand Chinese people at the end of Race Course Road on the edge of the Concession, attempting to break through the Concession's barriers. British troops, including the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, armed with machine guns, rushed to the scene and deployed police in front of the barriers. As a result, the crowd dispersed. Currently, the food situation here is very worrying. There is a lack of vegetables and daily necessities, but the supply of rice is still abundant.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 15th Dispatch] According to Japanese news, 50,000 Japanese are planning to carry out a "peaceful invasion" of the British Concession in Tianjin on Saturday. The participants are all local Japanese residents. They are determined to visit the Japanese military cemetery for the fallen in the Boxer Rebellion, and 2,000 Japanese reservists will participate in the parade. According to a Japanese newspaper report from Tianjin, as a result of yesterday's Japanese blockade, traffic between the Chinese area of the Japanese Concession and the British and French Concessions has decreased by one-fifth compared to normal. Of the 100,000 Chinese who normally need to go to the British and French Concessions for work every day, less than 2,000 were able to enter the Concessions by noon yesterday. The Japanese side made a perfunctory "apology," claiming that the current suppression of "communist" elements based in the Concessions is unavoidable, hence the delays.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 15th Dispatch] According to a Japanese news agency in Tianjin, three Japanese tanks appeared outside the boundary of the British Concession this afternoon. It is said that the tanks were dispatched because British troops had set up a guard post with three machine guns facing a Japanese sentry post not far from a Japanese inspection team, which the Japanese news agency described as having a "mysterious challenging implication".

—Firefly

A Rainy Night in Longhua

On rainy evenings, rural villages always have clusters of smoke curling up from the roofs, but Longhua Market did not have this phenomenon. From Taihe Market, we looked into the distance at Longhua. That gathering of over a hundred Chinese shops showed signs of devastation, unlike its usual ability to huddle together like a covey of quails. Taking advantage of the bad situation, people doing business were scattering to the east, west, south, and north, leaving behind a ruined and desolate town to accompany this miserable evening after the rain.

We approached Longhua. The streets we passed were filled with broken walls and rubble. We smelled the burnt odor. This smell, after encountering the wet steam on the burnt soil walls, was even more intense, rushing into our nostrils in waves. We better understood the "firepower" of the "Imperial Army"—this smell can produce a chemical reaction and increase our body temperature!

Passing by Fuchang Temple, there were many small pavilion-style stalls covered with thatched grass. The ground was trodden into a muddy mess, and there were sugarcane dregs, fruit peels, and all sorts of things that should be found after the clearing of the markets in the city. However, the people had long dispersed. We realized that this was the temporary market for our wartime civilians. At the same time, it reminded me of the story of "setting up a market at noon" that my teacher told me in my childhood.

We ran through the entire town. There was not a single intact house. Besides discovering a few elderly or middle-aged women dressed in rags with children in the ruins of the burned-down buildings, cooking on makeshift stoves made of brick fragments, there were no other people anywhere. I really cannot describe the desolation and misery of this town after being burned and killed by the Japanese. It only increased the sorrow in my heart.

We arrived at the Township Office and met Township Head Li Yu. We took off our drenched clothes, and everyone felt a little cold. Fortunately, the cotton clothes distributed to the refugees had not been completely distributed yet. Everyone took one to put on. Men and women all wearing these clothes looked just like refugees. We requested a solution to the problem of hunger and asked Clerk Yao (whom we had temporarily designated) to take care of it. He ran out like a flash and came back a moment later with the answer: "I can't buy anything, even rice is a problem." We were a little anxious, especially the dozen or so porters. Later, we discussed it with the Township Head and asked him to find a way. In the end, a solution was found. What about sleeping? This problem was now before us. The universe used darkness to urge us to solve this problem, but it was not difficult. "Each sweeps the snow from in front of his own door." Borrowing doors and other things, it was solved in various ways.

After solving the three problems of clothing, food, and shelter, we had to solve the problem of "travel." How should the propaganda work be carried out here? How should we finish the section of the road from Longning to Futian tomorrow? How should we carry out the propaganda work along the way? So, we held an evening meeting. In the meeting, everyone reported on the work just done in Longhua. "There was no one from the Youth Resistance Association, and there was no way to contact them." "The proclamation to the people has been posted." "Oral propaganda could not be carried out, only visits to a few old women." The result of the review was: "The estimation was insufficient, and the arrangements were not good."

After deciding on the itinerary and work for tomorrow in the meeting, we also sang a few songs to wake up this silent, dead city. Wasn't that so? For the entire night, there was no sound at all. Even the barking of dogs in the distance could not be heard.

### Tianjin Dispute Escalates!

[Central News Agency, London, 14th Dispatch] A Havas Agency reporter learned that the British Cabinet discussed the situation in Tianjin, China, today and immediately decided to order the Department of Commerce to draft a report proposing various means of economic retaliation against Japan, so that they could be gradually implemented if the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin lasted too long. It is said that the retaliatory measures include the following: (1) Imposing special taxes on Japanese ships docking in British ports, or restricting the rights of Japanese ships to dock in those ports. (2) Imposing import tariffs and restricting the quantity of Japanese goods imported into British colonies. (3) Taking some kind of action against Japanese currency. At this time, the British government is awaiting a report from Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie, informing them whether the Japanese government supports the actions of the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin. Government officials believe that there is not much hope of reconciliation, and only say that retaliatory measures must be implemented sooner or later.

[Central News Agency, London, 15th Dispatch] The British government attaches extreme importance to the Tianjin incident, and expects that the Japanese side may take similar anti-British actions elsewhere. Therefore, all relevant departments of the Department of Trade are considering how to deal with similar incidents that may occur in other places. It is said that terminating the British-Japanese commercial treaty and canceling Japan's preferential commercial rights in British territories are under consideration by the department.

[Reuters, London, 14th Dispatch] Regarding the statement by British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler in the House of Commons, according to Reuters' parliamentary correspondent, the British government is closely studying several aspects of the Japanese attitude towards British interests in Tianjin. It is generally believed that the Japanese side may launch similar actions elsewhere, and the Department of Commerce and other departments are currently discussing steps to deal with these actions. The dependence of Japanese markets on the United Kingdom and its colonies is also one of the issues currently being studied.

[Reuters, London, 14th Dispatch] The China Sub-Committee of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee sent representatives to visit Under-Secretary Butler this afternoon. It is reported that the two sides discussed the entire British situation in China, and the representative believed that Britain should take a tough stance to deal with Japan's provocative actions in Tianjin, not only to maintain this position in principle, but also to avoid setting a dangerous precedent by showing weakness. Under-Secretary Butler expressed sympathy for the representative's views and agreed to forward the representative's opinions to Foreign Secretary Halifax. Prior to this, Labor MPs had also sent representatives to visit Butler to discuss the Tianjin issue. It is reported that the Cabinet discussed the Tianjin incident and all aspects of British interests in China this morning.

### 50,000 Residents of Gulangyu on the Brink of Starvation; Three Japanese Warships Implement Blockade, Coercing Concession Authorities to Make Concessions

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to news from outside Xiamen, three Japanese warships have blockaded Gulangyu, prohibiting the transport of food to Gulangyu, resulting in a shortage of food. The 50,000 residents here are in a state of panic. Japanese newspapers say that firewood, coal, and vegetables are all prohibited. A Japanese spokesperson said that the main purpose of this move by the Japanese side is to make the Gulangyu Municipal Council realize what is happening, in other words, to urge them to accept the Japanese demands. The Japanese authorities had previously provided assurances that they would cooperate with the Municipal Council to stop illegal activities, but now they are taking blockade measures, which affects the major interests of China. The representative believes that Britain should adopt a tough stance to deal with Japan's provocative actions in Tianjin, not only to maintain this position in principle, but also to avoid setting a dangerous precedent by showing weakness. Under-Secretary Butler expressed sympathy for the representative's views and agreed to forward the representative's opinions to Foreign Secretary Halifax. Prior to this, Labor MPs had also sent representatives to visit Butler to discuss the Tianjin issue. It is reported that the Cabinet discussed the Tianjin incident and all aspects of British interests in China this morning.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to news from Shanghai, the English-language newspaper Great Evening Post today published a report from sources that Ambassador Cole had discussed the Tianjin issue with British Ambassador to Japan Craigie via long-distance telephone.

### Second Day of Blockade, Food Shortage Causes Panic; Japanese Inspection Still Strict

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to news from outside Tianjin, the food problem in the Concessions is gradually becoming serious. Although there are still stocks of rice and flour, there is a shortage of vegetables, beef, and milk.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to news from outside Tianjin, today is the second day of the Japanese military blockade of the British and French Concessions. There are still a large number of people waiting at the entrances and exits. The Japanese military inspection is still strict, and the situation is generally the same as yesterday. Although the Japanese military pays attention to inspecting British nationals, they also inspect those who want to enter the British Concession. Today, two German women and several Russian women were also inspected. Even showing their documents had no effect. However, women are inspected by female inspectors.

### Japanese Inspect British Ships, British Consul Advises Shipping Companies to Suspend Navigation

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to news from Tianjin, the British Consul-General in Tianjin has advised British shipping companies not to sail on the Hai River for the time being.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th Dispatch] According to news from Tianjin, a barge from the British company Jardine Matheson was sailing downstream this morning when it was ordered to stop and was thoroughly inspected by the Japanese side when it passed outside the boundary of the Concession. A few minutes later, the ship was again ordered to stop for inspection by the Japanese side at the Dalian Mail Ship Company pier. The sailors on board were not hindered. There has been no change in the situation near the Concession. There is a lot of traffic of Chinese vehicles in the Concession, so the inside of the Concession is very quiet.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th Dispatch] According to news from Shanghai, various companies in Shanghai have temporarily suspended the transportation of goods to Tianjin, but passenger transport continues as usual.

### British and French Negotiate Tianjin Issue

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 15th Dispatch] Political circles say that the main issue discussed by French Prime Minister Daladier and British Ambassador Phipps yesterday was the Tianjin incident. It is rumored that Britain and France will jointly send a note to the Japanese government in Tokyo, protesting the Japanese military blockade of the British and French Concessions in Tianjin. If the Japanese side does not stop the blockade, Japanese ships will not be allowed to enter the port of Singapore. However, it is said that the French Cabinet has not yet accepted the British proposal.

### ×Blockade of Tianjin Concession: How Did It Happen? Parisian Newspapers Speculate

[Reuters, Paris, 15th] Today, the newspapers here all commented on the Japanese army's blockade of the Tianjin concession, which was implemented when British representative Sir Stafford Cripps arrived in Moscow. Political commentator Pertinax wrote in "Le Temps" that, "Can we imagine that Germany and Italy, unable to obtain the cooperation of the Japanese Navy in the Mediterranean, are exerting pressure to have Japan strike in the Far East at a critical moment in European negotiations?" "Figaro" reported that Japan had four possible motives: (1) to threaten Britain, (2) to respond to Germany, (3) to respond to the German and Italian request for Japan to join a military alliance, and (4) to change the course of the war in China. "L'Humanité" declared that Japan, at the request of the Axis powers, wants to use intimidation and threats to prevent the realization of the "peace front." Madame Tabouis also wrote in "L'Oeuvre," commenting on the matter, "We do not need to overemphasize the Japanese military blockade of Tianjin, but Britain must not yield. This is a probing action by the Japanese side to determine possible actions in Shanghai."

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 15th] Here, Saulnier, the editor of "L'Ère nouvelle," commented yesterday that the Tianjin incident should not be regarded as an isolated event, but as a new development in the international situation. Telegrams from various places also confirm the same opinion. Saulnier said that Japan is merely using the excuse of handing over the Chinese, but is actually carrying out an anti-British movement. Japan's move stems from a desire to strengthen German-Japanese ties, and Japan wants to harass Britain in the Far East in order to assist its European allies. "Paris-Soir" stated that Britain, the United States, and France are preparing to establish mediation with Japan as soon as possible to prevent the Tianjin incident from becoming more serious. The newspaper also implied that Western countries are still focusing on European events. Japan's recent actions will prompt Western countries to quickly form an alliance with the Soviet Union, and this action will also make the Soviet Union willing to conclude an agreement with Western countries.

### Chongqing Opium Smokers Required to Be Eliminated Before the End of the Month; Chairman Chiang's Order to Chongqing Authorities

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Chongqing Mayor He Guoguang, upon receiving an order from Chairman Chiang, has ordered all opium shops in the city to close before the 15th, and all opium smokers must quit before the 30th.

### Japan's Strong Attitude Requires Britain's Complete Submission, Boasting No Fear of Economic Retaliation

[Reuters, Tokyo, 15th] According to a Japanese news agency from Tianjin, if the current Japanese plan ultimately fails, the Japanese authorities there have decided to take another tough step. Therefore, the only way to resolve the Tianjin incident is for Britain to revise its entire China policy, and not just settle for local negotiations. Because the Japanese in Tianjin feel that the time for resolving some individual issues piecemeal has passed, and it is not enough to satisfy them unless the entire Chinese concession is fundamentally resolved. In Tokyo, according to well-informed Japanese sources, it is rumored that Britain is currently considering economic retaliation, but Japan will not change its policy because of this, and this is because once sanctions against Japan are implemented, it will naturally conflict with the current Anglo-Japanese trade treaty, and Japan will inevitably take swift and effective counter-measures. Today, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma reported on the situation in China to the cabinet councilors, and at the same time discussed the issue of thoroughly implementing the "National Mobilization Law" and the Japanese government's price policy with the councilors. According to Rear Admiral Kanazawa, director of the Japanese Navy Ministry's Intelligence Bureau, the Japanese authorities have decided to resolve the Gulangyu incident peacefully.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Yesterday, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, and Army Minister Itagaki held a three-person meeting to discuss the Tianjin incident and the issue of foreign concessions in China. It is heard that the Japanese government has decided to blockade the British and French concessions in Tianjin until Britain unconditionally agrees to accept Japan's demands. Afterwards, Army Minister Itagaki further met with the Emperor of Japan to report on Japan's plan for the Tianjin incident.

### US Mediation in Tianjin Anglo-Japanese Dispute Denied by US Government

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] The State Department today formally denied rumors that the US government intends to mediate the Anglo-Japanese dispute in Tianjin. Secretary of State Hull also stated that he had not heard of the United States mediating the Tianjin incident, but the United States is still willing to do its best to resolve the case peacefully. He continued that the US government has ordered its diplomatic representatives in Tianjin to pay attention to the development of the Tianjin situation and, to the best of its ability, protect the lives and property of American merchants and residents in Tianjin. In addition, the US government will negotiate with Japan at any time on issues related to the United States. Some time ago, the US government prohibited merchant ships from transporting military supplies to Tianjin, otherwise, in the event of an accident, the US government would not be able to protect them. Regarding the Gulangyu issue, the United States has not raised any special negotiations with Japan.

### After Cripps Arrived in Soviet Union, He Visited Molotov; The Baltic Sea Remains the Focus of Negotiations; Dutch Newspapers Express Refusal to Guarantee

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 14th] French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Naggiar, visited British Ambassador Sir William Seeds and Sir Stafford Cripps, the head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, at 6:00 PM today, for an hour. Cripps immediately informed Naggiar of the contents of the instructions he brought.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 15th] According to Moscow reports in "Paris-Soir," the difficulty of guaranteeing the Baltic countries has not yet been removed. The Soviet Union is still insisting on providing guarantees to the Baltic countries. Sir Stafford Cripps, head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, had lengthy discussions with British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds on the first day of his arrival in Moscow, and visited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on Wednesday night.

[Reuters, Helsinki, 14th] The Finnish Foreign Minister's official newspaper responded to the Soviet "Pravda," saying, "It is unfriendly to offer guarantees to countries that do not want to accept them and are prepared to defend themselves. To impose guarantees is tantamount to aggression and damages the sovereignty of other countries." "Pravda" had on Tuesday demanded that guarantees be given to Finland, Sweden, and Latvia, and indicated that Estonia. The reason why the Finnish Foreign Minister adopted a cold attitude was probably due to the influence of Sweden.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 15th] Yesterday, in the British House of Commons, someone asked Prime Minister Chamberlain whether there had been any progress in the negotiations on the Anglo-Soviet agreement. Chamberlain replied that Sir Stafford Cripps, head of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, had arrived in Moscow with full government instructions to assist the ambassador to the Soviet Union in conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union. He will notify the House of Commons of any future developments at any time.

### Japanese Material Mobilization Plan, People Dissatisfied, Miyako Shimbun Criticizes in Editorial

[Reuters, Tokyo Correspondence] The Japanese Cabinet has decided on a plan to promote national material mobilization this year, but the details are still kept secret. The content of the new plan, as expressed externally, is the restriction of civilian material consumption, but because the Japanese government is keeping it secret, the people are complaining, thinking that the government should trust the people and publicly announce the details of the new plan. According to "Miyako Shimbun," "Since the 'China Incident' occurred, the Japanese people have felt inconvenience. Fortunately, Japan's food can still be self-sufficient, and there is no fear of famine. Under the new mobilization plan, the restriction of most materials is even stricter, so if you want to promote it smoothly, you must be careful and do not make the people feel panic. Although in reality, the Japanese government's method of allocating materials is not thorough, the result is the occurrence of various conflicts and frictions."

### German Consul in Britain Related to Espionage Case, Chamberlain Reported in the House of Commons, Official Denial After the Fact

The British government notified the German government two days ago to recall the consul immediately.

[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] Reuters received an official announcement today that the rumor that Reinhardt, the German consul in Liverpool who was previously requested to be recalled by the British government, was related to Crile, who was sentenced to imprisonment on suspicion of espionage, is not true. It is heard that the German government reserves the right to retaliate against the British side's request.

### Large Forces Concentrated on Czech Border, New German Conspiracy Unfolds

German Secret Police Chief Has Arrived in Prague, Highway on Czech Border Ordered to Suspend Passenger Transport

[Reuters, London, 15th] According to the "Times" correspondent in Prague, the chief of the German Secret Police, Himmler, has arrived in Prague, so the tension in Czechoslovakia has further increased. Recently, incidents have occurred in Kralove and Nachod, and Germans and Czechs have died, which makes the people there feel that there will be some changes soon. Some Czechs believe that Germany will first take action in Slovakia, and then change the status of Czechoslovakia. Germany has stationed troops in Slovakia and has been sending troops to northeastern Moravia near the Slovak border in the past few weeks. The seizure of Slovakia does not require Germany to mobilize large numbers of troops. The correspondent also described the symbols of German action in the next few days: (1) Locomotives in Prague and Pardubice must be prepared for the next two days; (2) Roads from Brno to Olomouc and Jihlava will also be closed to civilian traffic for two days.

[Reuters, New York, 15th] According to information obtained by the "New York Times" from "foreign private sources," 250,000 German troops are concentrated on the Polish border in northern Slovakia, including five infantry divisions, two tank divisions, and one heavy artillery division. The newspaper also carried a message from Prague with the headline "Czechs Fear They Will See Another Step by the Nazis to Seize Slovakia Today."

German Officials Still Deny

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 15th] Foreign newspapers are rumored to be mobilizing German troops on the Polish and Slovak borders, and there will be action. Regarding this matter, the newspapers here all published official denials in the most prominent position on the front page last night, saying that Britain and France deliberately spread this kind of news to divert the attention of the people at home, so that the obstacles to reaching an understanding with Moscow could be concealed. For example, London issued a message that German troops were preparing to enter Slovakia, making Slovakia a German protectorate. Paris said that German troops were rapidly setting up defenses along the Polish border, strengthening defenses, and preparing to oppose the "cruel German and Italian offensive" of democratic countries. The official German newspaper satirized the claim that Germany and Hungary intend to divide Slovakia, saying that this move is intended to urge Britain to quickly reach an understanding with the Soviet Union.

### Hungarian Parliament Opens, Regent Horthy Delivers Opening Speech, Advocates International Conference Convened by Pope

### The Astoundingly Resourceful Newspaper Smuggling Expert: The Secrets of Smuggling

In the 20th century, everything is more advanced than before. Take smuggling, for example. In the past, smugglers only dared to act furtively and secretly, but now it's completely different. "Stealing" has become blatant and forceful, with many such enterprises in Europe. Smuggling banned newspapers is a major part of this. Undoubtedly, this is a dangerous activity, punishable by death if discovered.

From the western border of Germany, at least 100,000 anti-Nazi pamphlets are smuggled in every week, organized by a Belgian who is also a graduate of a famous German university. Because of his anti-Nazi beliefs, he was once imprisoned in a concentration camp, but later managed to escape. Now he has become an enthusiastic figure in the newspaper smuggling business, smuggling mostly publications from Paris, Brussels, Prague and other major cities that promote freedom and socialism.

Mr. Pinner, the author of "Black Hell," once accompanied this smuggling expert on a tour of about 200 miles along the border mountain passes, and now he comes to tell you what he saw. In a house in Gelderland, Netherlands, he saw fifty exquisite rectangular packages. About the size of a shoe box, the words marked on the yellow wrapping paper said they were oil cakes for feeding livestock, but in fact, each package contained exactly fifty copies of "Die Zeitung," an eight-page newspaper, the paper of which was extremely small, only seven inches wide and five inches long. Printed in small type on Indian tissue paper, it had all the essentials of a large newspaper. He said, "In Germany, someone once told me that 'Die Zeitung' would give Hitler and his men a headache, more so than the cannons of Britain and France." Those who enthusiastically engage in smuggling are all amateur anti-Nazi comrades. In Germany, they secretly sneak to the border to receive those secret packages and then secretly bring them back. Many hired party members specialize in acting as lookouts and bodyguards. Sometimes, if they are chased too hard by patrols, they have to hide in caves in the foothills or deep in the forests, places so remote that it is simply impossible to find them. After being transported into Germany, they are stored separately in secret cellars. Then, each copy is folded to be only slightly larger than a postage stamp and secretly taken to the city for distribution.

In another area bordering Germany, Pingmin also saw thousands of copies of "Nová Svoboda" - a progressive weekly from Prague, and many copies of "Le Nouveau Front" and "La Bataille Socialiste" published in Paris piled up like mountains. From Friesland to Enton Lands, this 300-mile area has almost become a major base for the world's smuggling business. No less than 250,000 people depend directly and indirectly on this industry for their livelihoods.

There is a similar smuggling business at the border between Italy and Switzerland: three kinds of anti-fascist newspapers, "Grido del Popolo," "Giustizia e Libertà," and "Libertà," are mostly smuggled through the Alpine passes. These newspapers are first printed like ordinary four-page newspapers, and then reproduced photographically on extremely thin rice paper, then folded into a delicate little square, less than half the size of a playing card; but inside, they clearly print tens of thousands of words of shocking news. In addition, two smugglers once smuggled a thousand copies of "Giustizia e Libertà" into Italy, hidden in the lining of their belts. When crossing the heavy mountain passes, the newspapers were hidden in hollowed-out sleds and the thick soles of boots.

On June 11 last year, Professor Lods, the editor-in-chief of "Grido del Popolo" in Paris, was assassinated in Bagan, generally believed to have been done by the henchmen of the fascists. Although the French police authorities found many facts proving that it was a politically motivated assassination, the murderer ultimately escaped.

"Grido del Popolo" has always been smuggled into Italy by stuffing goods into the stomach. Not long ago, about 10,000 copies were sandwiched in a batch of soap, transported from France by ordinary freight trains. The soap is a common commodity in Italian households, and each newspaper is hidden under the "how to use soap" leaflet. When people open the wrapping paper, they see the tiny folded newspaper, which contains a great deal of real news from Abyssinia and Spain, and other unexpected news, all of which the Fascists want to cover up.

### Weather Bureau

Today's weather, the weather forecast predicts again: sunny and cloudy, or windy and rainy.

The mysterious death of the beautiful Jin Bei'er on Peking Road, Kowloon on Sunday is becoming more and more mysterious. At first, it was thought to be a wronged ghost under the wheels, then it was feared to be from beating, and now it has become a wronged soul falling from a height. Moreover, it also involves Filipina girls. It looks quite strange, romantic, and tortuous. However, Hong Kong detectives have always been known for their ability, and I think they will soon be able to get to the bottom of this strange case. However, we think this is locking the stable door after the horse is stolen and is quite laborious. Speaking of it, it is that set again. We hope that the authorities can send more patrolling police officers, so that the moment of Jin Mu'er's death was already clear at a glance, isn't it?

Yesterday, there were not many thefts that occurred in one day, with a total of three. If the above requirements are met, the authorities can increase the number of patrols, then killing two birds with one stone will reduce the number of robberies, maybe even to zero. Isn't that happy? May our hopes not be in vain!

### Ghost

A person went to visit an antique gallery. In the long and dark corridor, there was only another stranger walking along.

"It's a bit eerie," the person said.

"Do you believe in ghosts?" the stranger asked.

"No, I don't. Do you?"

"I do." After saying that, the person immediately disappeared.

Mussolini Votes

### Answer:

1.  Do you know how cold Antarctica is? Anything placed in the air will immediately turn into ice. The American expedition brought refrigerators to Antarctica to "keep" the food warm, not to freeze it.

2.  In the democratic country of France, women do not have the right to vote, but in the dictatorial Soviet Union, they do.

3.  You learned it in elementary school, the moon cannot emit light by itself. Its light is entirely reflected from the sun. If the eastern hemisphere has no sun, where does the western hemisphere get its moonlight? Of course, how can you kiss your lover in the moonlight?

4.  Radio short waves travel 186,000 miles per second, while sound waves only travel 1,200 feet per second. Think about it, who will hear the lecture first, the person sitting in the back row or the person thousands of miles away?

5.  The current Prime Minister of the Irish Free State, Éamon de Valera, was spared death in the Easter Rising of 1916 because he became an American citizen.

6.  Arabs like to ride white horses entirely because they absorb less heat than horses of other colors. Strange, isn't it?

7.  Shakespeare had no favorite actresses because there were no actresses at that time. The women on stage were all 'men dressed as women'.

### One Person a Day

— Tan Xiaopei

When it comes to Peking Opera, the three generations of the Tan family must be mentioned. Among the three generations of grandparents, Xinpei need not be mentioned, and Fuying is still popular, but Xiaopei, who is in the middle, has neither been uniquely favored by heaven, nor has he benefited from the legacy of his ancestors, and he does have a bit of a suspicion of being a mere place filler. In the old capital, when asked who is best at playing Lü Boshe, it is Xiaopei. Because when Xinpei used to play Chen Gong catching and releasing, Xiaopei played Lü Boshe. Now that Fuying is playing Chen Gong catching and releasing, Xiaopei still plays Lü Boshe. With more than 40 years of experience, he can only be publicly recommended for the role.

There was a newspaper in the old capital that drew a cartoon of the three generations of the Tan family a few years ago, with Xiaopei in the middle, the grandfather on the left, and the grandson on the right. Words were drawn from Xiaopei's mouth. To the left: "Your son is not as good as my son." To the right: "Your father is not as good as my father."

### Sea Storms 5

— By Captain Lawton, translated by Yang Bi

Previous excerpt: In 1914, when the European situation was tense, the German-American shipping line's "Kronzprinz Wilhelm" carried six million gold bars to Germany. Jack, the radio operator of the Cox Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took this ship to travel to Europe. On the ship, they met the French aviator Roumon Garot. At the same time, Jack made friends with Boffa, the German radio operator on the ship. Jack was working in place of Boffa, receiving a strange message...

"Now, let's not worry about that first," Jack interrupted, "Take this report to Captain Locke immediately, send it yourself, don't go through anyone else's hands. If the passengers find out, they will panic immediately."

Boffa, still with his eyes and mouth wide open, quickly went to do his errand.

"Captain Locke is probably coming out soon," Roumon Garot said. "He will call us all out, we had better go out now, but before that, we must not publicize it. There are more than two thousand passengers on this ship, if they know there are two warships chasing us, that's terrible!"

Three - Aimless Running

A quarter of an hour later, Jack was lying on a chair on the deck, still studying the shocking news he had just heard in his mind. An attendant walked up to him and cautiously leaned in and said, "Captain Locke is in the radio room and wants to see you immediately. Please go!"

"What's going on now?" Jack wondered. He walked towards the radio room, speculating, "I think it must be because I took over the radio without permission. Poor Boffa, I must find a way to keep him from being blamed. I am a passenger now, and the shipowner can't do anything to me."

He thought as he stepped into the radio room. Captain Locke was a tall man with a shrewd appearance and a large, handsome beard. Also in the room were a sailor and Hayes Boffa, who was terrified and looked like he had been reprimanded. As Jack walked in, the captain's tall body was still swaying in front of him.

"You are the one who took over the radio for this good-for-nothing, letting him go out to chew salty biscuits with people, right?" he asked Jack sternly, but there was a strange light in his eyes.

Jack calmly nodded, admitting that he had taken over the management of the machine when Boffa went out to stretch his legs. He was prepared to accept the German's tirade against him. But, unexpectedly, the captain patted him on the back. "Good!" he shouted; "You did very well, otherwise, this good-for-nothing would not have covered this machine, and the British cruiser would have come to check us. Now, I want to discuss with you, you are a radio operator. Our other operator is sick, and now, there must be someone sitting in the room at all times, would you like to take this position?"

Jack was speechless. This proposal was too sudden and he found it difficult to decide for a moment.

"Do you want me to help until China?" he asked.

### South China Defeated in Saigon, Mo Qing Cables Urgently, Li Huitang Expresses Firm Refusal to Join the Expedition

(Special report from this newspaper) The South China Southern Tour Football Team, after moving to Saigon, although in the first battle, they defeated Nanqi B with a score of three to two, but in the second battle, they were defeated by Nanqi A with a score of three to five. The previous shame has not been avenged, and they have suffered another disastrous defeat. The local overseas Chinese are very disappointed with it. It is found that the reason for South China's defeat is that the formation is not appropriate, and Yang Shuiyi is forced to serve as the left wing, and the performance is useless. The front line is too much of the whole ball, and they often lose opportunities to win. However, it is also because the other party's skills are outstanding and seem to be better than South China.

Team leader Mo Qing, in view of the fact that the army has just arrived in Saigon and has suffered unfavorable losses, there are still many powerful enemies in the future, and he is sincerely afraid that it will be difficult to achieve good results. He also feels that the front line lacks talents and the shooting skills are mostly uncertain. Therefore, he thinks of Li Huitang, who is still in the rear. If he can rush to the team midway, he will lose at Dongyu and gain at Sangyu. It is not too late, so yesterday he sent a telegram back to Hong Kong, asking Huitang to quickly take a plane to Rangoon to join the team.

After receiving the telegram, Huitang told reporters that he was too busy with official duties to take leave, and it was difficult to comply with team leader Mo's request.

According to another news, Java originally invited South China to compete, but it must be conditioned on Huitang accompanying the expedition. Java now knows that Huitang cannot go with the weak team, so it has cancelled the previous appointment and invited the Indian team to this competition instead (Football Field Tai Sui)

### Practice of Rowing a Boat with Two Oars

— Pan Congshao

[Special Report from this Newspaper] Rowing a boat is not a trivial matter. It takes some time to practice to be able to operate it freely. How to use oars, sculls, and poles to propel the boat forward, and how to control the direction of its progress. Although there is more than one way to row a boat, what learners practice is nothing more than these two points.

For the sake of easy understanding and practice, the practice of rowing a boat starts with the sampan driving of propelling a boat forward with a single oar. This has already been published in this column. What is recorded in this article is the practice of using two oars.

The power of pushing the boat forward with two oars is greater than that of a single oar, because the greater the pushing force, the greater the resistance against the water. Moreover, simultaneously and sequentially taking care of the use of two oars is a difficulty that beginners feel has not been experienced in the process of practicing single oars. Secondly, using two oars, while paddling to make the boat go forward, also doing the action of the direction of the boat, that is, not causing the boat's speed to decrease greatly due to the use of two oars as rudders, is not easy to do.

When rowing a foreign boat with two oars, if it is not a single-person action, there should be a person in charge of the rudder. Beginners should take this opportunity to gradually become proficient in the use of arm strength and the grip of the hand on the boat. As for multi-person rowing with two oars, the boat's speed will lose its lasting uniformity due to the improper driving of one of them.

One person operates two oars, and the directions of the two oars are the same at the same time. The driver sits in the boat, facing the opposite direction of the boat. When the body bends forward and both hands protrude forward sharply, the two oars held in the hands have already been flipped out of the water, passing over the surface of the water and pushing backward. When both hands are dragged backward, the two oars re-enter the water. In order to increase the resistance of the oar against the water, the body must lean backward in the middle of changing the oar to paddle the water forward. When the two oars that are being paddled forward are dragged out of the water, the body returns from tilting to facing forward. In this way, holding the oar handles with both hands and pushing forward, that is, the two oars cross the surface of the water and push backward, drag backward, and the changing oar in the water paddles forward, the power of the boat is naturally generated from the action of the oar paddling forward against the water.

Soon, the skin of the palm that grips the oar will feel strenuous due to the use of rowing, and it is easy to break. This suffering is not difficult to endure. On the other hand, beginners with little strength will feel tired in their arms after not even dozens of rowing strokes, and they will not be able to maintain the same forward and backward position of the two oars in the water and on the surface of the water. It becomes chaotic.

When using a changing oar, its fulcrum should be where the oar touches the side of the boat, the hand holding the end of the oar is the point of force, and the part of the oar blade that resists the water is the point of emphasis. When the point of emphasis generates the effect of pushing the boat forward, you can pay attention to the direction of the blade surface against the water, and do not tilt it, of course, it cannot be directly facing the water. In each process of the two oars paddling forward from the back, do not sink too deep. The angle between the oar blade and the vertical line must always be maintained below 30 degrees, but at the beginning of the oar blade leaving and entering the water, try to increase the angle, which can reduce the resistance of the oar against the water, and also avoid the method of wasting hand strength. It is worth paying attention to avoid both disadvantages.

When changing direction in the boat, it is easy to do with the force of the two oars paddling the water. For example, if you want to turn left, the right oar resists the water, that is, its gravity is slightly strengthened. If you need to turn sharply or make a large turn, the left oar stops completely, and the gravity of the right oar is particularly large, then you can achieve it. The action of taking care of the direction while rowing with two oars is not very difficult, but it is difficult to maintain a straight forward direction. This must be done. The gravity of using two oars must be uniform in the progress of the boat. Generally, people's left and right hands have some differences in strength, and because the position of the two oars in the water or on the surface of the water cannot be consistent, the difference in gravity is even greater, which makes the forward direction of the boat unable to maintain a straight course.

Since the advantages and disadvantages of rowing with two oars are clear, as long as you practice more, you will have considerable success.

Mr. Zhaoxiong: Please come to the editorial department for a chat at 8:30 tomorrow night.

### Expectations for Contributors to the Supplement

— Shangqing

We already know that the responsibility borne by supplement editors is significant. However, the establishment of a supplement cannot rely solely on the editor; it also requires submissions from contributors. Moreover, the editor's views are often influenced by the contributors. After all, the editor cannot act unilaterally and stubbornly. An editor working alone, single-handedly managing a supplement, or at most inviting two or three close friends to perform a one-man show, does exist, but this is not proper and not a common occurrence, thus not worthy of emulation.

From this, we can see the importance of contributors to a supplement, seemingly even above that of the editor. And since I already have expectations for the editor, I cannot but also have expectations for these contributors.

I hope they will choose the supplement they want to contribute to and not submit randomly. There are many supplements, and while the content and nature of some may be similar, there are also many that differ greatly or do not align with your views, which you must pay attention to. If you submit randomly and go down the wrong path, especially to an outdated, degenerate, or even reactionary supplement, even if they publish your work and offer generous payment, I don't think you will be happy! Furthermore, if you are submitting for the sake of payment, just to get published, then I hope you will be careful with your pseudonym and not use the same one, so that others cannot figure out what kind of writer you really are.

I hope they will not follow behind others. If someone is discussing topic A, don't you also discuss topic A. If someone is describing object B, don't you also describe object B. Your subject matter should always be unique and fresh, never parrot what others say and write stale clichés.

I believe that the universe is vast, and there are countless things in the human world that can be used as material for writing, at my disposal. The saying "inexhaustible and ever-flowing" can be interpreted in this way. As long as you are willing to pay attention at all times and in all places, and cultivate a keen sense of observation, I guarantee you that novel material can be found everywhere. (However, you must not be too curious and get stuck in a dead end.)

I hope they will not cater to the editor's psychology. It seems that contributors catering to the editor's psychology is the most common phenomenon. Some contributors do not seem to focus on improving their own work but instead try to figure out the editor's preferences. This is wrong. I have already said that contributors can influence the editor's views. As long as your work is good, both in content and presentation, even if you have not catered to the editor's tastes, I believe that an editor who is fair and discerning will not bury your hard work. Then, you may even achieve unexpected success. However, if the editor's views are indeed correct, then contributors should not ignore them but rather use various clever writing techniques to promote and expand upon them.

I hope they will consider the environment. Naturally, what I am saying only applies to local contributors at present, because there are various restrictions in this area that contributors need to consider. Otherwise, it will not only be a waste of effort but also harm the newspaper. However, my intention in saying "consider" is not so negative; on the contrary, I mean to consider it actively. We must never forget our current important task, which is to resist the war and build the nation. We must fulfill our responsibilities as writers, using various topics and techniques to write unified articles that promote the movement to resist the war and build the nation. I firmly believe that the pen of a writer is indeed omnipotent, and the oppression of a particularly harsh environment cannot prevent the emergence of particularly proactive articles!

Besides these hopes, of course, I also hope that every contributor will not write boring texts, accusatory texts, or any texts that harm others without benefiting oneself or even harm oneself. I think that proper contributors are certainly well aware of these things, so there is no need for my verbose reminders.

However, what I have said above is addressed to a mature contributor. By "mature," I mean that their thoughts, views, and writing skills are all above the average level. If I were addressing an immature contributor—in other words, a contributor whose thoughts, views, or writing skills are still very naive in some aspect—I would have different expectations.

I hope that such contributors will immediately stop submitting! Of course, I understand their interest or their self-importance. However, at a time when the entire nation is focused on saving the country, I believe that everyone should be able to use their strengths to directly contribute to the cause of national salvation. Since you are not confident in your submissions, why waste your energy and resources? You can reserve your interest and self-importance for after the victory, when the world is at peace, and then slowly satisfy them. As for some immature contributors who complain about not getting published, either blaming heaven and earth or criticizing the editor for being blind and selfish, or repeatedly seeking favors to get their face shown in the newspaper, I think that is especially unacceptable. I hope that in addition to stopping immediately, they will also sincerely repent!

Perhaps general contributors will feel dissatisfied with my expectations, saying that I intentionally wronged them. I hope they will appreciate my sincerity: I have no other intention than to hope that they will have proper and outstanding development. Moreover, I myself am also a contributor, and I am using these expectations to encourage myself!

### Wearing Shoes (Part 1)

— Mingzhi

——Grandma's Story——

"Oh, it's been a while since I've seen you; how come you're here again today?" Li Jingen at the teahouse exclaimed as soon as he saw the old grandma.

The old grandma was still the same, with a shallow basket in her arm, selling beans.

"After I sold the beans last time, I went back home to get more; unexpectedly, just as I was about to come back, I heard that things were a bit uneasy in town, and I was too scared to come until now. I inquired and found out that things are mostly calm, so I came back to do business."

"Not only was it uneasy, I almost lost my life!" Li Jingen said with emotion.

He had the common habit of farmers in the countryside, exaggerating the things he encountered, especially the dangerous ones. According to him, the night the troops stormed the town, he slipped out the back door and, under a rain of bullets, crawled for a long time before he managed to escape with his life. However, he said that he had taken a bullet to the thigh and still had trouble walking.

As he spoke, he pulled up his trousers to show the old grandma. Sure enough, there was a bandage on his left leg, but it was impossible to know what kind of injury he had sustained.

"If 'they' hadn't treated me quickly the next day, I'm afraid this leg would have been useless. 'They' are actually good to people."

The old grandma smiled and said, "Yes, it could be like that."

At this time, some of the teahouse customers had already heard Li Jingen's story and didn't express much after hearing his words. But some were here for tea for the first time today, and after hearing him, they couldn't help but come over to take a look, each offering some comments.

Li Jingen was still talking non-stop about what happened that night, not only describing it vividly as if it were happening before their eyes but also interspersing it with many remarks about how good "they" were and how "they" did this and that.

"Please eat some yellow sand beans to replenish yourself," the old grandma said as she saw him talking non-stop, scooping a handful from the basket and placing it on the table. "These are lotus seeds for beggars, good for people who have been injured."

"Oh, I forgot, I still owe you for the beans!" Li Jingen said as soon as he saw the beans. "How much is it? I'll give it all to you today."

"Haha," the old grandma laughed, "You forgot about the bean money, but I forgot about your shoes!"

"I went to Li Jiaqiao a few days ago and went to your house. Your wife said that she received the money you brought back and that she knew I would come here to sell beans. She could see you, so she asked me to bring you a pair of shoes."

"Then where are the shoes?"

### "The Gates of Hell"

— Zeng Zhaojun

Jin Zhengqi has been without an "official" position for eighteen years, if you count them on your fingers. This long and difficult journey has filled his hollow and rough belly with the resentment of being "an unrecognized talent"—he often took a palm-leaf fan, sat at the gate of the Jin family ancestral hall, crossed his right foot over his left, and vehemently cursed the government that didn't value intellectuals for being terrible and useless. Or—he would use the handle of the fan to strike the ground hard, loudly singing lines from operas like "Talent is rejected by a mediocre ruler, integrity alienates old friends!"

Since February of this year, when Jin Zhengqi's hometown—Tang County—fell, he had been blessed with official luck due to the changing times. He no longer sang Beijing opera at the entrance of the ancestral hall. From the 22nd, he went to work every day in a flat-roofed house with a corner blown off by artillery fire. This place was formerly the site of the county government.

He was truly a little carried away. The joyful mood of the past few days replaced the depression of more than ten years. He sat smiling in his armchair, his left leg still comfortably crossed over his right, black lacquer on the desk in front of him, pasted a big red strip of paper he wrote in person, neatly encrusted with the words "General Affairs Director Seat" five dark purple characters, plus a big exclamation mark below.

But happiness doesn't last long, the troubles that come are many.

One day, a stern-looking armed officer came to the maintenance association, stroking his mustache and lightly asking:

"Which one is Director Jin?"

"That would be me." A ninety-degree bow, his "integrity" not very "upright".

"So it's you?" The officer rolled his eyes at him. His voice getting a bit rougher, "Listen up! By eight o'clock tomorrow morning, send fifty pretty girls to the military headquarters for 'use'! They must be top-notch, understood?"

"Reporting, officer, almost all the pretty girls in our county have run away. It's certain that we can't find fifty, and..."

"Bullshit!" A thunderous roar cut him off, "You're really useless, if you don't send them on time tomorrow, watch out for your dog life! My words are as hard as diamonds!" The officer said in one breath! With a "swish" he turned around and strode away, his footsteps heavy, hitting Jin Zhengqi's heart one after another.

"Alas! It's hard not to be an official, but it's even harder to be one!" Jin Zhengqi slowly walked back to the office, looked around as if there was no one, and sighed softly.

"Ha... ha! Since you know it's difficult to be an 'official', then why did you come?" A wanton laugh startled him, and he turned his head to look. It was the clerk Gu Mutian who worked in the same office.

"Haha! Then why did you come?" Jin Zhengqi said awkwardly.

"Me? Alas! You don't know about me, I was forced to do it with a gun to my head, it wasn't my own free will! To tell you the truth, I am a citizen who escaped from Shanghai, and I ran here thinking I could work in peace, but unexpectedly, a week later, our troops retreated. I took one step too slow and was caught here to write these conscience-erasing notices, for the sake of my life there's nothing I can do, it's really 'when you pass under someone else's eaves, you can't help but lower your head'."

"Hey! Keep your voice down, it's not a joke if people hear these words. I'll discuss something with you. Today the regimental commander ordered me to send fifty women to the military headquarters by eight o'clock tomorrow morning, where can I find them in a place like this ruin, Mr. Gu, would you be willing to help me?"

"Anything else is fine, but I'm sorry about this. I remember the night before last, I was having tea at Fu Lai, and more than a dozen guerrillas sneaked in. They stood up and gave speeches, urging everyone not to send their beloved sisters to the vicious enemies!" Gu Mutian said, then said "goodbye" and left.

The next day, Jin Zhengqi tied up twelve green-faced women and sent them to the military headquarters to hand them over, when he came out the sides of their cheeks were marked with red slap marks. From then on, he hated his master very much, and felt that Gu Mutian's words were very good, and the two became good friends.

One evening.

The north wind angrily struck the trees, the sky had no moon, and no stars, the chest of the soil was pressed down by darkness, the surroundings were eerily quiet, only the sound of a river, moaning softly.

In a corner of Tang County, after a burst of tight gunfire, a majestic song shook the area——"Arise! You who do not want to be slaves!" breaking through the dark curtain of the sky,

Next to the Security Maintenance Association, two figures stood in a small alley, their hands clasped together, one saying:

"Brother Jin, the time has come, I'm going back to my team! I hope you can come soon, and we can be together again." The other said:

"Mutian! Go, run into the arms of your own people! That is heaven—there is sunlight; there is spring. Alas! I, I am still knocking on the 'Gates of Hell'!"

### From Chengdu to Xi'an

— Lin Huanping

4. The Difficulty of the Shu Road

The car crawled slowly like a reptile, with every passenger experiencing hysterical psychological abnormalities, mired in illusions of danger and safety. Suddenly, I remembered the lines from Tang poetry: "The Shu Road is difficult. More difficult than ascending to the blue sky!"

Now that I am walking on this Shu Road that is "more difficult than ascending to the blue sky," I truly experience the reality of these lines. It is said that modern science is advanced, roads have been opened, and cars can be used to traverse it in a few hours; in the past, walking on foot would take half a month or a month. So, where exactly is the difficulty of this "Shu Road, Shu Road" difficult road? It's none other than the first pass of Western Qin!

5. A Night in Ningqiang

At 3:30 in the afternoon, the car arrived in Ningqiang. Because the road was difficult to travel, it was feared that it would not reach Hanzhong, so it was decided to stop here.

Ningqiang County is larger and more "prosperous" than Mianyang and Guangyuan. I got off the car, dragging my tired body and my two feet that were numb from sitting on the car without being able to stretch, and limped along with my luggage to find a hotel on the street. Following the mud on the road after the rain, after about five minutes, I discovered the red paper sign of "Ningkang Hotel" at the door of a wooden flat house. My soul was attracted to it, and I walked straight towards it. I had a preconceived notion in my mind, that there wouldn't be good hotels in this kind of place anyway, and I was so tired, I just needed to find a place to rest. I stepped through the gate, turned into the middle hall, and stood on the stone steps of the patio. When I looked at it, it was a neat, two-story wooden house, painted very new and dazzling, immediately giving my weary soul infinite pleasure. I asked the tea boy if there were any empty rooms, he said yes, so I decided to stay here. He led me up to the second floor, through the corridor of the middle hall, across a round door, and into the back hall. He opened the doors of two rooms on both sides and said to me respectfully:

"Sir! These are the best rooms."

I decided to stay in the one on the right. The tea boy carried my luggage in.

The room was about fifteen feet square, like it had two wooden beds, an eight immortals table, a rectangular small table, and two round stools. A clothes rack, the cotton bedding on the bed was also clean, and there were two small windows for ventilation. Compared to the inns like latrines in Mianyang and Guangyuan, this could simply be said to be worlds apart.

The four sides of the room were plank walls, painted with white paint. The passersby had inscribed many poems on the plank walls. Here are a few of them:

"One Chengdu to here the road is not flat

Thousands of mountains and valleys rise into the sky;

The mind gallops like lightning without stopping;

The winds and clouds of Western Shu are along the way."

This poem describes the scenery on the road from Chengdu to here, but it is not concrete and profound enough.

"Rongzhou comes here, still a thousand li,

Revitalize the national soul to Chang'an;

Sweep away the traces of the Japanese invaders to quell the hatred,

Otherwise, I would rather die than live on!"

### Relief Association Prepares for "July 7th" Vegetarian Meal and Flower Selling Campaign; 350,000 White Hibiscus Paper Flowers to be Made; Letter Sent to Chamber of Commerce to Borrow Meeting Room as Office

### "Tianxia" Issue No. 2 to be Published Today

The first low-priced popular newspaper and magazine in the country, "Tianxia" Pictorial Bi-Monthly, has seen its first issue sell over 10,000 copies in Hong Kong alone since its launch. In order to increase readers' interest, the content will feature domestic and international current affairs, and will be even more exciting than the first issue. The number of photos has been increased by more than double the previous issue, and the price is one dime. It will be published today, it is said.

### The Diocesan Boys' School Student Strike Remains Unresolved; More Than 120 Students Have Left the School; It is Reported That the Taiwanese Head Prefect Has Resigned to the School

The Diocesan Boys' School student strike remains unresolved to this day. The school authorities reported that the situation remains unchanged, and more than 120 students have left the school. The school authorities have already ordered the students who left the school to return to school for classes yesterday morning, but it is learned that the deadline has been extended to Monday next week. The school authorities have also dismissed seven or eight student leaders who initiated the strike. Currently, most of the students who have left the school are senior students. All students in Class A of the second year, Class A of the third year, and Class A of the fifth year have left the school. Most of the Chinese students in Class B of the third year and Class B of the fifth year have also left the school. It is said that a small number of students returned to school yesterday, but the number of students who left the school was also equal. The rumors about striking students preventing other students from attending classes are not true. Although a small number of students scattered dust on the ground of the school's playground yesterday morning, they did not take any further action.

Furthermore, it is learned that the Taiwanese head prefect selected by the school authorities has submitted his resignation to the school in view of the fact that the students insist on their opposition, the student strike has been prolonged, and there is no way to break the deadlock and eliminate the dispute, so that another person could be elected to take over. If so, the Diocesan Boys' School student strike, which has been going on for many days, will probably be resolved in the near future, it is said.

### The Number of Homeless People is Increasing Daily: Solving the Root Cause of Homelessness Requires Improving the Lives of the Poor; Rent and Commodity Prices Have a Direct Impact

To alleviate the issue of homelessness, the Homeless Relief Association is actively involved, and the authorities have established civilian palaces to provide shelter. The expenses borne by the Hong Kong government are considerable. However, homeless men and women still fill the streets of Hong Kong, with no sign of decrease. In the past, homeless people were only found on major roads such as 大道中 (Dàdào Zhōng - Central Road), 大道東 (Dàdào Dōng - East Road), 大道西 (Dàdào Xī - West Road), Connaught Road, and Des Voeux Road. Now, almost every street has them, even near Caine Road on Aberdeen Street, where there are over twenty homeless people, building makeshift shelters under the eaves of wealthy people's homes. Furthermore, behind a certain house on Seymour Road, some have even built houses to live in. Those concerned with social issues believe that solving the problem of homelessness in Hong Kong requires improving the lives of the poor. Some homeless people rely on finding work near their homeless encampments during the day. If they are moved to a further location, their source of income may be taken away. Even if their job is not taken, living far away means spending time and money on commuting. For these reasons, the homeless are unwilling to move elsewhere. The only way to eliminate homeless men and women is to pay attention to and improve the lives of the poor. The high cost of rent, high commodity prices, and inconvenient transportation all drive the poor to homelessness. According to someone who pays close attention to the homeless population, the number of homeless people has more than doubled in the past two years. The newly homeless are different from the original homeless. They carry luggage, personal belongings, and necessities and sleep under makeshift tents at night, resembling a family. These homeless people are not from the mainland. It is simply due to high rent and commodity prices, as well as the situation where there are more people looking for work than jobs available. Therefore, they hope that the authorities will seriously pay attention to (1) rent problems, (2) commodity price problems, and (3) transportation problems. If the above four problems can be solved effectively, the number of homeless men and women will naturally decrease or even disappear.

### Why is Banditry so Rampant? No. 5, Gillies Avenue, Western District Robbed by Four Bandits Yesterday Morning; They Knocked on the Door, Claiming to Look for Someone; When the Door Opened, They Rushed in, Used Fake Guns and Scissors to Rob Two Hundred Dollars

Flat 4, No. 5, Gillies Avenue, Western District, was robbed by four bandits yesterday morning, who broke in with weapons, resulting in a loss of over a hundred dollars before escaping with the stolen goods. According to the victim, Mrs. Feng San (29 years old), who reported the case to the No. 7 Police Station afterwards, at around 9:30 AM that morning, she and her partner were having breakfast when they suddenly heard someone knocking on the door, claiming to be looking for a Mr. Wen (who works at the 大東 (Dàdōng) Printing Company) who lived in the building. Since the visitors could name the person they were looking for, they did not suspect any fraud and opened the door. They then saw four men rushing in. One of them was someone she recognized. After entering, the four men immediately closed the door and pulled out sharp weapons from their pockets, one holding half of a pair of sharp scissors and another holding a child's toy gun, threatening everyone present. Most of the occupants were women and children, and seeing the ferocity of the bandits, they did not dare to shout and allowed them to do as they pleased. The bandits then drove everyone to a corner, gagged them, and tied them up one by one. After everything was arranged, they began to rob, which lasted about twenty minutes, before leaving with the stolen goods, yelling as they went. After the bandits left, they struggled to untie the ropes and called the police. After checking their belongings, they found that $97 in Hong Kong dollars, $50 in Hong Kong silver, $4 in provincial coins, a dart, and a gold dart pendant had been stolen, totaling a loss of $192.20. She requested that the case be filed and investigated. After receiving the report, the police dispatched detectives from the Central and Western Districts to investigate the scene and deployed uniformed and plainclothes officers to patrol the surrounding areas and question passersby.

### The Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange Society Elected New Officers Yesterday; The Chairman Reported on the General State of Affairs of the Society Over the Past Year; $200 Allocated to Console the Family of Yin Wen

The Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange Society held its 28th general meeting of members at the 金陵 (Jīnlíng) Restaurant yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. Two to three hundred members attended, creating a lively atmosphere. The outgoing chairman, Mr. Zhong Daqing, presided over the meeting, conducting the rituals and delivering an opening speech. After the speech, the election of the 23rd board of directors was held, concluding at around 6:00 PM. A banquet was then held to celebrate, and the meeting adjourned late into the night. The chairman's original speech and the election results are recorded below:

Chairman's Original Speech: Fellow members, today is the 28th general meeting of our society, and we are electing the 23rd board of directors. This is the most important annual gathering. I am very pleased to see so many members participating, both young and old. Looking back to this day last year, I was honored to be elected as chairman with the support of all members. Another year has passed in a flash. During this year, thanks to the guidance of my fellow members and the assistance of my colleagues, I have thankfully managed to avoid making any mistakes. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly report on the state of affairs of the society over the past year. Since taking office, my goal has been to rectify the society's administration and to prioritize increasing revenue and reducing expenses. Given the complexity of the society's affairs, I was deeply concerned that even a slight oversight could cause damage to the overall situation. In order to ensure thoroughness in handling matters, I divided the society's affairs into five groups: diplomacy, finance, documentation, general affairs, and investigation, with the current directors working together in their respective areas. All matters related to the society's reforms were discussed and considered with the input of all members. This collective wisdom ensured that all measures were implemented in an orderly manner. Although we have not been able to bring the industry to prosperity, we have been able to maintain the status quo in this extraordinary period of economic downturn and transportation obstruction. This is largely due to the close cooperation and solidarity of the members and executive committee. In the past year, our country has been plagued by continuous warfare, with smoke and fire filling the sky. Farming has been disrupted, businesses have been suspended, and people have been displaced and are in desperate need of help. We urgently hope for assistance from overseas Chinese. As citizens of our country, living in a foreign land, our hearts are with our homeland. We have spared no effort in providing relief to disaster areas, comforting soldiers, and supporting various national salvation movements. For example, the flower-selling fundraiser on July 7th of the 27th year, the donation campaign on August 13th, the collection of raincoats and winter clothing on September 18th, and the personal distribution of relief and comfort to refugees in Pingshan, 浮 (Fú), Fanling, and Shenzhen districts by members of our society this spring, as well as the recent one-dollar donation campaign to repay debts, and the fundraising efforts along the streets in response to the British Relief Association, all achieved remarkable results and were highly praised by the public. In addition, it is worth mentioning the fundraising campaign last year on August 13th to assist the fruit vendors in the Sheung Wan district, which involved many twists and turns and difficulties in the friendly state’s governance. Fortunately, with the patriotic enthusiasm of all members, the campaign was completed, raising a large sum of over several tens of thousands of dollars, which was presented to the central government to strengthen our national defense and was especially commended by the authorities. However, this kind of righteous act is the duty of every citizen, and we dare not claim any credit for it. I am simply reporting it to let people know that our nation has this selfless spirit. As my term comes to an end, I am relieved to be relieved of my responsibilities. I am ashamed of my incompetence and lack of accomplishments. I sincerely hope that the members will elect other capable individuals to take over and revitalize the society's administration. Finally, I would like to express my most sincere wishes for the prosperity of the Chinese Gold & Silver Exchange Society and the happiness of all members.

Election Results: The results of the Chinese Gold & Silver Industry's election of the 23rd Executive Committee members and officers are as follows, with the number of votes received:

(Standing Treasurer) 天福號 (Tiānfú Hào) (77) votes

(Special Treasurer) 昆誠號 (Kūnchéng Hào) (115) votes, 安泰號 (Āntài Hào) (70) votes

(Vice Chairman) 永隆號 (Yǒnglóng Hào) (79 votes)

### Nearly Two Inches of Rain in the Past Forty-Eight Hours

Hong Kong has experienced several torrential downpours in recent days, with a total rainfall of over an inch. According to the Hong Kong Observatory, a total of 1.955 inches of rain fell from 10:00 AM on the 14th to 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The most intense rainfall occurred from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM the previous evening. At that time, lightning flashed in the Lei Yue Mun area, and heavy rain poured down, lasting for an hour, resulting in a rainfall of 1.047 inches. Afterwards, the weather alternated between sunny and rainy. From 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM, another 0.25 inches of rain fell, and from 2:00 AM to 3:00 AM yesterday morning, 0.10 inches of rain fell. The rainfall was quite heavy at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The amount of rain during this period has not yet been tallied.

### The Death of Campbell; Possibly Fell from a High Place; Police Investigation of the Case is Gradually Making Progress; Filipino Girl Admits Campbell Left His Clothes in Her Room

Campbell, an employee of the China Aviation Machine Trading Company, was found injured in front of the (Cao Jiage Lao) Hotel on Peking Road, Kowloon, at 5:30 AM last Sunday morning and died shortly after. The police authorities are intensifying their investigation into the cause of Campbell's death to determine the truth. According to police investigations, the deceased was seen drinking at the Peninsula Hotel that evening until 2:30 AM on Sunday morning, when he left the hotel accompanied by a

Young Filipino Girl.

At 2:15 AM, the deceased had checked the time in the hotel. After leaving the hotel, he waited for a European friend in a taxi in front of the hotel, intending to go for Chinese food together. They then drove to Shanghai Street and later to a restaurant on Nathan Road. After the meal, the European friend dropped the deceased and his companion off at the (Cao Jiage Lao) Hotel and then said goodbye. According to the woman who accompanied the deceased that night (who resides in the (Cao Jiage Lao) Hotel), she and the deceased parted ways at 4:30 AM that morning and she went back to her room to sleep. The deceased's whereabouts after that are unknown until 5:45 AM that same day, when she was awakened by a neighbor's noise. She went out onto the balcony and peered down at the road, where she saw a man lying on the ground. She recognized him as Campbell and rushed downstairs to hire a rickshaw to report the incident to a close friend of the deceased. They arrived at 6:15 AM. The woman admitted that

The Deceased Left His Coat

in her room. When asked why the deceased, who was usually neatly dressed, would leave without his coat, she replied that it may have been because the deceased was absent-minded and intoxicated, causing him to leave his coat behind. It was also found that the deceased had received $300 last Saturday to pay his West YMCA rent, but the bill had not been paid. During the meal that night, the woman saw him take out one hundred-dollar bill and one ten-dollar bill. According to Detective Inspector Jin Xian, who is in charge of this case, the police authorities have obtained some clues, but nothing has been confirmed. Inspector Jin believes that the injuries sustained by the deceased were caused by a fall from a high place or being hit by a car.

### Hong Kong Chinese Women's Association Anti-War and National Construction Photo Exhibition

To be held from the 18th at the Clubhouse on Ice House Street

The Hong Kong Chinese Women's Association and the League for the Defense of China are hosting a photo exhibition scheduled to be held from the 18th to the 21st of this month (Sunday to Wednesday) at the Women's Association Clubhouse on Ice House Street. All the photographs participating in this exhibition have never been seen by the public and are sufficient to show the actual situation of our country's war of resistance and national construction. School authorities should pay special attention to this exhibition, as these photos are more likely to reflect the actual situation of our country during the war than any other object. In order to enrich itself and relieve disaster victims, the Chinese Women's Association will charge an admission fee of ten cents per person.

### Police Bribery Case Continued Trial Yesterday Afternoon; Sergeant Ives is Suspected of Concealing Facts

Ruan Zhaoji, a translator from the Hung Hom Police Station, was charged with extorting $110 from Liu Xiyu on April 23rd. Deputy Superintendent Ives was also charged with indirect extortion of $110 from Liu Xiyu on the same day. The case was prosecuted by Government Counsel Mr. Wei and continued to be heard at the Kowloon Magistracy under Judge Qian Si yesterday noon. First, Mr. Ma Qi, a witness for the prosecution, took the stand to answer questions from Mr. Shao Yali, the lawyer representing the first defendant. He stated that those sitting and talking upstairs at the Xie An Club were Ma Han, Zhang Qiang, Liang Jiequan, and eight others sitting in another corner who made the gambling agreement. He then replied to Mr. Wei's questioning, stating that when he identified the first defendant at the police station, he pointed out the person who went upstairs with the plaintiff. Next, Mr. Xi, a member of the Xie An Club, testified that on the night of April 22nd, he attended a banquet at the Da Guan Restaurant. During the banquet, he gambled and won over four dollars from a man he did not know. The man gave him

A Hundred-Dollar Bill

and he gave him change. He then gave the hundred-dollar bill to Ma Qi to exchange it for him. Following this, lawyer Laosibi took the stand, stating that on April 24th, two Chinese men came to his office and reported what had happened to them at the police station. He then advised the men to report to the police authorities. At the same time, he first spoke to Deputy Superintendent Xiufudun on the phone about the general outline of the matter. He replied to Mr. Xiao Zhongshi's questioning, stating that the men had mentioned two police officers from the Hung Hom Police Station, one was a deputy superintendent and the other was a translator, but they did not mention their names. Following this, Deputy Superintendent Xiushidun testified that on the afternoon of April 24th at 4:30, he had spoken to lawyer Laosibi on the phone. As a result, he ordered Detective Haokeng to show him the plaintiff's statement. The following day, the 25th, Mr. Haokeng met with him as scheduled and brought

The Plaintiff's Statement.

At 2:30, Deputy Superintendent Ives also came to see him in his office. He then showed him the statement. However, the defendant returned the statement to him. He then told him that the plaintiff's statement had several characteristics, but the defendant did not answer. He then asked him, "Where were you when the translator Ruan spoke to the plaintiff?" After listening to his words, Ives immediately replied that he was not present at the time. The witness then said that based on his twenty-six years of experience in the police force, if he encountered a case of counterfeit currency, his procedure for handling the case, in his personal opinion, would be to first order the police to search the person. If no counterfeit currency was found, then he would inquire in detail about the person's address, resume, and occupation. If the answers to all the questions were satisfactory, then he would immediately release the person. The police station could decide internally whether or not to prosecute such trivial matters. Also, a British police officer in the position of deputy superintendent must first pass the second-class Cantonese examination. There are currently over two hundred British officers in the police force who have passed the second-class Cantonese examination, twenty to thirty who have passed the third-class Cantonese examination, and only four who have passed the Cantonese examination. According to what the plaintiff said in his statement, every deputy superintendent

Could Understand

the witness. The witness recounted the identification process on April 25th. The first defendant was mixed in with a group of nine Chinese deputies, all of whom were wearing suits. Wu Jiequan, Zhang Qiang, and Ma Qi identified the first defendant, while Ma Pan was unable to identify him. He then answered the questioning of Mr. Shao Yali, stating that after the witnesses finished identifying the person, he asked them when they had seen the first defendant, but the witnesses replied that some said 10:00, some said 10:15, and some said 11:00, all without any hesitation. Next, he answered Mr. Xiao Zhongshi's questioning, stating that based on his meeting with Ives, his impression was that Ives had

Concealed Something.

After Detective Ma Feipa testified to the confession of the second defendant to the court, the judge adjourned the case to be heard again on June 30th at 11:30 AM.

### Unprecedented Solidarity of Hong Kong Theater Actors Big Contribution "Before Dawn" Premieres Today Joint Grand Performance at Lee Theater Tonight and Tomorrow Night

Everyone knows the role of drama in the War of Resistance, but this must rely on the full utilization of artistic forms, using mature, orthodox themes to reflect the reality of the War of Resistance. The positive role of drama is not to be neglected. Our enthusiastic drama colleagues are precisely a group that cannot be ignored. They integrate politics and art, threading them together, turning them into an unyielding force, stirring up the public everywhere, inspiring the public, and fully expressing their combativeness. This can be seen in the results of each charity performance by various theater troupes in the mainland and Hong Kong. This can be seen even more in the joint charity performance of "Before Dawn" at the Lee Theater on the 16th and 17th, tonight and tomorrow, by the Hong Kong-based China Travel, China Art, and China Relief theater groups. If the previous charity performances of the various theater troupes were units of force, then this joint performance is a generation of strength. In the present time of intensifying the promotion of spiritual mobilization, it will definitely have a great effect and achieve the greatest results. We sincerely wish for

Even more, these three theater troupes, after the charity performance, will embark on their respective missions to the mainland or abroad. In this way, they themselves – the playwrights – are like a sharp needle, threading a steel-like line (drama), going around the world to connect every Chinese heart, fighting for the motherland! Therefore, we can also say that this joint charity performance is an expression of the playwrights linking the public and handing over drama to the public, handing over the spirit to the motherland. We pay our respects to them!

What must be mentioned here is "Before Dawn." This play is divided into four excellent independent plays, and these four plays are the most quintessential and outstanding representative works of the past twenty-odd months since the War of Resistance. The content all depicts the touching and inspiring stories before dawn. Although these four plays have different styles and different performances, they all have a very clear theme, which is to use extremely artistic techniques to express a national and ethnic demand – "If you have money, give money, if you have strength, give strength!"

Among these four plays, two of them touch on the theme of contributing money. One is "The Thief," which deeply moved many people during the previous performance by China Relief. The other is the newly staged "Atonement," which persuades people to dedicate their hidden and unused things and wealth to the struggling motherland. Although the themes of these two plays are similar, they have two different flavors in their writing techniques. In addition, "Dawn," written and directed by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, also uses a touching fact of "giving strength if you have strength" to contrast the "do-nothing attitude" of those who do not give money. "The Performer" uses a tragic experience to move the audience, causing everyone to be vigilant and introspective, and to stand firm to overcome the current difficulties.

The people participating in this joint performance are all the most prestigious first-class drama workers in Hong Kong – and also in the country. The directors are Mr. Ouyang Yuqian and Mr. Jin Shan. The performers (listed in order of the number of strokes in their surnames) include Wang Ying, Li Jingbo, Li Danlu, Jin Shan, Jin Li, Jiang, Tang Huaiqiu, Tang Ruoqing, Tang Ruoying, Ke Gang, Fan Zheng, Sun Zhaoxin, Qin Xiaozhu, Zhang Lide, Tong Yi, Huang He, Yang Wei, Deng Zhujun, Ge Xin, Su Mei, Xiao Ziying, and Su Hui. This group of the most outstanding actors will not be unfamiliar to the audience in Hong Kong and does not need our introduction. As for those who are responsible for the stage design, lighting, costumes, props, and effects in this performance, they are all experienced workers from their respective organizations. Now that the essence is gathered in one furnace, its perfection and greatness are self-evident.

We believe that this performance will definitely let the audience in Hong Kong know the highest form of current drama, and will definitely further calculate the foundation of a new stage of spoken drama. In order to achieve the highest level of theatrical art at the stage, and in order to appreciate the fighting form that is about to arrive at dawn, we must never miss this opportunity. Moreover, all the proceeds from this joint performance will be donated to domestic cultural undertakings, which is an even greater reason for compatriots who love their motherland and love drama to do their best to support it.

Shanghai Special

### Sundays in Shanghai

— Tingkang

On weekdays, Nanjing Road at around eight or nine in the morning appears bustling with activity, with every eastbound public bus or tram crammed full of people. Clerks and staff rush to their offices at this time. However, Sundays have a slightly different feel. Each carriage is quite empty, and the newsboys selling morning papers at the stations aren't shouting with much vigor because everyone recognizes Sunday as a day of rest, a day to get a reward for a week's hard work.

However, for Shanghainese, rest means "having fun." When colleagues meet after work on Saturdays, they'll ask, "Where are you going to have fun tomorrow?" So, Sunday becomes a day for "having fun," and different types of Shanghainese have different places to have fun.

First, I want to talk about something that isn't exactly "having fun." Just by looking at the many yellow churches with pointed spires in Shanghai, one can understand the potential of Christianity in Shanghai. These churches are very active on Sundays. Those pious men and women, regardless of any important matters, must devoutly go to church to pray and listen to the pastor preach doctrine before they can relax because this ritual may include repentance and correction for the past six days.

The U.S. Fourth Naval District in Shanghai also holds prayer services at the Great Shanghai Theatre every Sunday at 10 a.m. The attendance is very crowded, including upper-class Chinese, students, middle-class merchants, and so on. The majority of them are probably thinking "the drinker's heart is not in the wine" because after the naval service, there is an hour of music and singing, which is indeed quite enjoyable. This free enjoyment is enough to make even non-believers willing to sit for two hours. Besides this, perhaps there are other purposes, but I am not aware of the details.

Shanghai has fifty movie theaters and six opera houses, and none of them fail to be full on Sundays. The customers here include gentlemen, students, and the petit bourgeoisie. At the greyhound racing track, people's heads are moving restlessly. Many enthusiasts are immersed here, and winning a few double jackpots is more comfortable than going to the office every day. Inviting a friend to a teahouse for a chat, from the world situation of Zhang Bolun catching a cold in Rome to the disappearance of the Wang family's kitten next door, while enjoying all kinds of snacks you like, is naturally a pleasant thing. If the weather is good, then carrying a camera to the park is an option. Although the price of film has soared terribly, and the park has become a refuge for the upper-class refugees, the park is still a place with trees and grass.

Culture Street has declined pitifully, but on this day, some people still take advantage of their leisure to come and browse. Those doing the same browsing are some wives and children. However, the location is in several famous department stores. They greedily look from here to there, wishing they could bring all their favorite things back home. In fact, the paper bags in their hands can't hold any more.

Dance halls and restaurants are always so crowded on this day that it seems they hope customers won't come, but customers seem to enjoy the crowds and keep coming. Lunch starts before twelve o'clock, and even if Huadiao wine is one yuan per catty, there are still people drinking it.

Some are entertaining themselves, some are reveling, but some are also doing nothing. I immediately saw the latter: Wang Jinbiao, the doorman next door, is still sitting dumbly on the bench by the door, indifferent to Sunday; the young man in the grocery store across the street is also staring blankly at the pedestrians and vehicles on the road...

### Casual Chat About Shanghai Evening Newspapers

Although Shanghai is the sixth largest commercial port in the world, with a population of 3.5 million, and is also the center of the country's economy, culture, and so on, it is shameful to say that the history of evening newspapers in Shanghai is only fifteen years.

The earliest form of evening newspaper that Shanghainese encountered, as far as I can remember, seems to have been after the outbreak of the so-called Qi-Lu War staged by the two major warlords of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. At that time, the evening newspaper was called the "Southeast Evening News."

Originally, Shanghainese reading newspapers at that time: first, they looked at the theater advertisements, that is, the page that published theater advertisements, the so-called "Theater News." After reading the theater news, second, they looked at the local news. The purpose of reading local news was to diligently search for "social news" with a scandalous flavor in the cracks. Then, they opened the supplement of the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies School, read humorous articles and romantic novels, and finally checked the main paper to look at the headlines of domestic and foreign events. Naturally, merchants were quite interested in the economic news section, and housewives were perhaps interested in the "big sale" advertisements of all stores. Different people had different information they liked to read, but indifference to the domestic situation and international situation was a very common phenomenon among general newspaper readers in Shanghai fifteen years ago.

The above is the status of general morning newspapers in Shanghai society fifteen years ago. Morning newspapers were like this, so the fate of evening newspapers can naturally be imagined. In addition, Shanghainese at that time did not have the habit of buying evening newspapers, and the Qi-Lu War was outside the concessions of Shanghai. There was no roar of artillery, let alone the high flight of airplanes, so there was no "exciting" coverage. Therefore, after a short process, the evening newspaper was completely disconnected from Shanghai.

At that time, Shanghai children had a very common nursery rhyme about the Southeast Evening News, singing in the streets and alleys... "Southeast Evening News, eat your dinner, not enough capital, go to sleep." It meant that selling evening newspapers was only possible after dinner to make a few big bucks. After dinner, the job was done, and it was time to go to sleep.

After that, until the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the "September 18th" Incident occurred in the Northeast, and the situation changed rapidly. At that time, Shanghainese had experienced a revolutionary process and even recognized the relationship between national affairs and the people. Therefore, the so-called "evening newspaper," which had disappeared for six or seven years, reappeared in Shanghai for the second time in response to the needs of the general public. However, at that time, the evening newspapers were all issued by the original newspapers in Shanghai, so they were generally called "extra editions." After the "January 28th" battle, which followed the "September 18th" Incident, temporarily ended, the general "extra editions" were reorganized into "evening newspapers." However, since there was no strong stimulus from current events, and there was no information on current events that could be used to appeal to the public in the evening newspapers, Shanghainese gradually became less interested in evening newspapers. However, this time, although the general evening newspapers failed to capture or have a large readership, evening newspapers in Shanghai had finally laid a considerable foundation.

In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, the outbreak of the "July 7th" Incident, followed by the all-out War of Resistance against Japan on "August 13th," began. In the unfolding of this great era, various "evening newspapers" were flying all over the streets of Shanghai. Although the wholesale price of an evening newspaper was only 15 to 25 copper coins, on the most popular days, an evening newspaper could be sold for 6 to 10 cents in the hands of buyers. After the complete fall of Greater Shanghai, evening newspapers became more and more numerous, but the interest of readers was inversely proportional, decreasing day by day. Therefore, recently, even the first-class evening newspapers are only worth one cent after 8 p.m. However, on days when "special good news" is published, they are still very popular with Shanghainese, who compete to be the first to see them. Even if the price temporarily rises to three cents per copy, they are still easy to sell.

### Nanjing Road Is Undergoing Changes

— Hongtao

Nanjing Road was originally the center of the concession, but now it is the center of the entire Shanghai. The phenomenon of isolated Shanghai can be seen from Nanjing Road. Nanjing Road has undergone many changes in this short period of more than a year. The desolation of Nanjing Road at the beginning of the August 13th battle and the bustling scene of today are two extreme situations that are truly unimaginable. This change is the most special page in the history of Nanjing Road's rise and fall.

Before the war, Nanjing Road was indeed the most prosperous place, but this prosperity was only a superficial appearance of its location. Its internal reality could not conceal the pervasive stagnation. The radios and big sale banners of the stores and the blowing horns and drums only added a little vitality. The times for going to work and getting off work three times in the morning, noon, and evening seemed a bit noisy, but at other times, although pedestrians on the road were constant, the business of the stores was not all thriving. The Taifeng, Ningbo Industrial Bank, Dashengfu, and Dahu Bank, several decent-looking huge buildings, were all empty. But now the situation is completely different. People are constantly crowded from morning to night. On the not-very-long road, countless new stores have been added. The several huge buildings mentioned above now have new owners and have been completely changed. The original site of Taifeng is now Qiu Tianbao Silver Store (there are now two Qiu Tianbao's on Nanjing Road, the one across from Old No. 9 Lun is a branch, and the main store was formerly at Xiaodongmen). The original site of Ningbo Industrial Bank is now Dachang Silk Store, the original site of Dashengfu is now China National Products Company. The building across from the Hongmiao Temple was the Shanghai National Products Company before the war. The various businesses of ××× collapsed, and this building was left empty. After the war, it was opened as a refugee camp, and the building was even more damaged. But now it has become a new building with a cement facade, and its new owner is Fang Jiuxia Silver Store, which has returned to Nanjing Road. The Dahu Building of Dahu Bank has now been changed to New Daxing Building, and the magnificent facade of Xinda Xiang has added infinite excitement to Nanjing Road.

The new stores that have opened on Nanjing Road now are mostly silk stores, silver stores, pharmacies, and ginseng and swallow's nest shops. Among them, the pharmacies have a northern flavor, and the rest of the stores are mostly transferred from Xiaodongmen.

Among the four major companies on Nanjing Road now, the facades of two major companies have been renovated. The first to be renovated was the New World, at the end of the previous year. The Hong Kong-style corridor was changed, and the storefront windows were rebuilt in their original location. The walls of the store were changed to creamy yellow marble, but perhaps the construction was not very careful. After only a short time, the color looked a bit dull. The latter to be renovated was Sincere, which also changed the bottom-level facade to light yellow marble. It seems that it has not been fully completed yet, and all of Sincere's glass-covered corridors have also been changed to cement. This is probably because the previous iron frame was affected by the bombing and could not be completely straightened, so it could only be covered with cement.

The bomb scars on Sincere seem to have completely disappeared, but the author has found a flaw that can never be erased, that is, the two coiled dragon iron pillars that were replaced on the second floor of Sincere, whose coiling posture is the opposite of the original. The original ones coiled upwards, and the current ones coil downwards. This may be a temporary oversight by the workers, but this can truly leave a record of this injury. In the future, if someone repairs the anecdotes of Nanjing Road, this will be one of the major events in the annals of Nanjing Road.

According to insiders, there are currently about 1,000 to 1,500 poor children and unemployed people in Shanghai who make a living by selling evening newspapers. Their daily income ranges from 20 cents to half a dollar. Most of them are people whose homes were destroyed by artillery fire, but their current lives are still maintained by war. Because if the war is declared over, Shanghainese will forget about evening newspapers again, and at that time, it will naturally not be easy for evening newspaper sellers to seek their livelihoods here. But don't look down on them as poor people who only sell evening newspapers, they all have the common awareness that "only when the War of Resistance is won will there be food to eat."

### Restaurant Alley

In the cosmopolitan city of Shanghai, it is indeed difficult for ordinary poor scholars to solve the four major problems of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Taking "food" alone, although many large restaurants are opened on the road, the golden signs of "Beijing cuisine" and "Cantonese food" only allow the wealthy class to enjoy themselves. Under this urgent need, restaurant alleys have emerged and have maintained their prosperous and lively situation.

Many people may wonder about the origin of the term "restaurant alley." I also asked an "old Shanghainese" over seventy years old. He told me that when he first came to Shanghai, the restaurant alley had already taken shape. In this way, the long history of the restaurant alley has created its current scale, and it has indeed reached its golden age.

Restaurant Alley is the common name for Cichang Lane on Nanjing Road. This is an old-fashioned lane. In addition to connecting to Nanjing Road, it also connects to Jiangxi Road in the west, and there are also two exits on Sichuan Road in the east. Because most of the lane is filled with small restaurants and small noodle shops, it is familiar to everyone. By relying on its "cheap and good" operation, it has attracted countless customers. Inside, there are Cantonese restaurants, local small restaurants, Muslim halal restaurants, "Pork Rib Noodle King" specializing in noodles, Western-style coffee and bread shops, open-air "civilian food stalls," noodle shops baking sesame cakes and fried dough sticks all day long, and sticky rice cake stalls where people can wolf down food... No matter what kind of person comes inside, they can find their favorite food. No matter what kind of person, they will feel that they have exchanged sufficient food for a satisfactory and low price. This is truly the most "joyful" event.

Clerks from foreign firms, students, workers, Indians, patrolmen, impoverished White Russians, and beggars are all regular customers here. University girls in everything from mink coats to high heels and permed hair, to "playboys" in suits and leather shoes, all flock in at noon, and after one group finishes eating and leaves, the waiting group sits down to solve this major problem. If the weather is clear, there are also "private seats" set up in the open air. The entire alley is crowded with people. In one corner, there are many workers eating on the ground, solving the problem of hunger with white rice plus 30 cents of vegetables. Beggars are at the restaurant doorways, buying fish bones and leftover rice for a penny. White Russians are eating vegetables with clumsy chopsticks in coffee shops. Indians are eating hard bread. Everyone is desperately filling their stomachs in order to "live."

Usually, spending 20 cents inside is enough to eat a full meal. An economy meal is 20 cents, plain noodles are 5 cents, a bowl of white rice is 60 cash, and tofu soup is 260 cash. Being a bit more aristocratic, spending 30 cents is enough to eat to your heart's content. In addition, there are stalls selling oranges at the doorways. Buying a Tianheshan honey orange for 3 cents and eating it all the way back truly makes people feel a little blissful.

The restaurant alley is praised. In this era of expensive rice and firewood, it is indeed a good companion for the poor class. Although the light inside is dim, the air is polluted, and it is far from the scenery of the high-rise buildings of large hotels, it still gives people a satisfying enjoyment. Its fame and prosperity are certainly not accidental.

Odds and Ends

### Overseas Vessels Sailing From the Port of Shanghai Change Place Names for Customs Clearance

Most Other Ports Have Stopped Sailing

A notice from the Japanese customs commissioner of the Jianghai Customs stated that starting June 1st, vessels sailing from nine ports in the Jianghai area must obtain permission from the Japanese Navy and Army in advance, obtain a permit, and also obtain the approval of an additional customs commissioner before being allowed to clear customs. On the 3rd, the Wantong, a British-owned Taikoo company vessel, was refused customs clearance due to not having completed the above procedures, resulting in one suspension of service. On the 5th, Haimen and Qidong were changed to Qinglong Port, and Sanhe Port before customs clearance and sailing was permitted. However, it was reported that inland port vessels cleared customs as usual. The customs authorities decided to comply with customs regulations and maintain administration in response to the Japanese customs commissioner's obstruction of vessel customs clearance. It is now learned that the customs authorities do have the intention of maintaining this, but it is difficult to cope under these special circumstances. The incident of the Wantong vessel being blocked from customs clearance last Saturday already shows the difficulties of the customs authorities. It was also reported that although the Japanese customs commissioner's notice stated that vessels sailing to nine ports, including Haimen, Qidong, Funing, Quanzhou, and Xinghua, must have a permit issued by the Japanese Navy authorities, and the relevant permits and customs declarations must be signed by the Japanese customs commissioner before being cleared for sailing, all foreign shipping companies had not complied as of yesterday. The reporter also knows that the shipping companies have indeed not complied, but the reason for not complying is because they have not dispatched ships to the prohibited ports, so there is no need to comply. As for the Taikoo company's Niuzhuang vessel, which was originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Xiamen on the 6th, also stopping at Xinghua and Quanzhou, was later changed to sail to the Northern Seas. Yesterday afternoon, it loaded more than 10,000 bags of flour, more than 300 pieces of cotton yarn, and groceries to Qingdao and Tianjin. Although changing routes is common for shipping companies, it is not surprising. However, the Niuzhuang vessel's dispatch to the prohibited areas of Xinghua and Quanzhou was just after the Wantong vessel was blocked from customs clearance, so the Niuzhuang vessel's change of route is different from usual and may be slightly related. It was also said that although the names Haimen and Qidong are no longer used for vessels sailing to Beisha, customs clearance has not been signed by the Japanese customs commissioner. It can be seen that the purpose of the prohibition is in the names. Since the vessels do not use the names Haimen and Qidong, they will naturally not be obstructed.

### Copper Coin Shortage in Shanghai, Buying Scrap Copper and Iron

Exchange Shops Experiencing Financial Difficulty

Although the financial situation in Shanghai has been prolonged by the war, it has remained stable as a rock and its credit has been outstanding due to the sufficient reserves of the National Government. However, a sudden shortage of copper coins has occurred in the market, and the exchange places are also affected by this, making it difficult to maintain and causing financial difficulties. Even the transportation vehicles, which are usually full of copper coins, are sometimes panic-stricken and have to use banknotes instead. This shows that the Shanghai copper coins are obviously being manipulated or even secretly hoarded, resulting in a sharp decline and shortage. It is hoped that the silver and money industry in this city will pay close attention to this, uphold integrity, and maintain the people's livelihood. At the same time, it is learned that the Japanese puppets have been actively collecting scrap copper and iron in the Jiangnan area in recent months, transporting them to Shanghai for storage. A warehouse has been prepared near the puppet "Fish Market" outside the Bund on Qiwupu Road, totaling no less than 10,000 tons, waiting to be transported to Japan in batches. As for the purchasing agencies, they are densely distributed everywhere, dispatching unscrupulous lackeys to entice ignorant residents to sell their old iron tools, resulting in an increasing scarcity of old copper and scrap iron.

### Date of Establishment of Northern Suzhou River Police District Undetermined

Candidate for Police Chief Not Yet Determined

The Zilin News reported that the Japanese-language mainland newspaper in Shanghai reported on the 31st that a new police district will be established on the north bank of the Suzhou River, named "E" District, to be headed by a newly appointed Japanese assistant police chief. According to a senior official of the Public Works Department, this has been partially confirmed. However, the official stated that many proposals discussed by the Public Works Department and the Japanese authorities since March of last year, the establishment of this new police station is only one aspect. In addition, according to another source, the new district may include the Dixiwei Road and Jiaxing Road districts. However, the official stated that the Public Works Department did not issue this regarding the appointment of a Japanese police officer from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department to this new position. The Japanese authorities may have already determined someone in mind for this new position, but have not yet discussed this with the Public Works Department. The Japanese newspaper's prediction that the new district will be established in mid-June is also premature. Although negotiations have been going on for fifteen months, they have not been formally agreed upon.

### Residents of Zhabei and Hongkou Refuse to Pay Harsh Taxes Imposed by the Puppet Regime

Numerous Arbitrary Taxes and Fees

Various arbitrary taxes that have already been levied in Zhabei, Hongkou, Yangshupu, and other places, such as setting up factories and workshops, opening shops and businesses, and retaining the remaining burnt residences, must be registered with the puppet "Social Affairs Bureau" and pay various registration fees and taxes. Recently, so-called household registration taxes and seasonal taxes have been added to the above-mentioned industries and residents. The general residents who moved to Zhabei are mostly poor people who could not maintain their livelihoods due to the high rents and other expenses in the concessions. Some are even unable to afford food, so they all refuse to pay.

### Traffic Safety Campaign Underway in the French Concession

Pedestrians Must Walk Within White Powder Lines

In order to maintain pedestrian safety, the French Concession authorities have ordered the police to post red and green slogans on major roads to advise pedestrians to be careful when walking. They have also marked pedestrian lanes with white powder at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue du President Haig, and stationed police to advise pedestrians on how to walk when the traffic lights are on, requiring them to walk within the white powder lines, otherwise they will be reprimanded.

### French Concession Rickshaws Prohibited From Carrying Patients

Risk of Contagious Diseases

Recently, rickshaws have often been found carrying patients in the French Concession. The French police authorities believe that this poses a risk of contagious diseases to public health and it is necessary to strictly prohibit this. A statement has been issued as follows: "It has been found that rickshaws often carry patients in this city. This is prohibited by the rickshaw regulations promulgated by the Public Works Department. Therefore, the French police station specially draws attention to this prohibition to avoid the risk of contagious diseases. In the future, if rickshaws are found carrying patients, in addition to revoking the license, the owner will be fined and bear the cost of disinfecting the vehicle."

### Birthday Banquet Turns Into a Brawl Over the Bill

Birthday Woman Seriously Injured

Wang Yehong, a native of Dongtai, and his son, Wang Baosheng, held a 40th birthday celebration for Wang Yehong's wife, Wang Yangshi, on the 31st of last month. They sent out invitations and booked ten tables of 6-yuan dishes at the Fuxingyuan Huizhou restaurant on Route Cardinal Mercier. In the evening, guests gathered, but the dishes were not enough, so they added another table, for a total of eleven tables. After the guests dispersed at 9 p.m., the bill was settled. The dish price plus the tip was 3 yuan, for a total of 69 yuan. However, Ms. Yang's side only agreed to pay 58 yuan, and insisted on deducting the remaining amount. The restaurant refused because the difference was too large. After several arguments, Wang's side gradually increased the payment to 68 yuan, but insisted on deducting 1 yuan for the tip, and was unhappy in their hearts and spoke rudely, leading to a conflict. Then they started fighting. Shao Shetiao, a 24-year-old Anhui native in charge of the coal stove at the restaurant, was holding an iron rod to poke the coal in the coal stove. Seeing this situation, he felt injustice and ran out with the iron rod and struck Ms. Wang Yangshi's buttocks. Because the iron rod was blunt, half of the left side of her buttocks was punctured. Furthermore, because she was pulled, the wound was lengthened to about three inches, and blood flowed like a fountain. When Ms. Wang Yangshi's husband and son saw Shao wielding an iron rod, they stepped forward and beat Shao. Shao Zhongqian, the restaurant's accountant, and apprentices Shao Zhongpu and Fang Zhongbing, and cooks Wu Zhitang and Huang Er, rushed out to mediate, and a brawl broke out, damaging doors and windows. Afterwards, Wang reported to the police station, which sent detectives to arrest Shao Shetiao, Shao Zhongqian, Shao Zhongpu, Fang Zhongbing, Wu Zhitang, and Huang Er, a total of six people, confiscated the murder weapon, an iron rod, and a wooden door bolt, and took them to the police station.

### Registration Certificates for Da Mei and Zhong Mei Newspapers Returned

Da Mei Morning Post to Become a Weekly

It is now learned that the registration certificates of the American-owned Zhong Mei Daily and Da Mei Morning Post, which were revoked by the Public Works Department two weeks ago, have been returned. Zhong Mei Daily is scheduled to resume publication today. Da Mei Morning Post, because the person in charge of the newspaper has no intention of resuming normal publication immediately, will change its procedure and issue a weekly publication under the name of Da Mei Weekly. As for the British-owned Shanghai Times, which suspended publication for two weeks, it was originally scheduled to resume publication on the 2nd. It is now learned that the newspaper has changed the date to the 5th because it still has some arrangements to make in terms of business.

### Car Number One and Driver Number One

Everyone knows that a car driving on the roads of Shanghai must have a "license plate." The most recently issued car "license plates" must exceed number 10,000, which indicates that there are at least ten thousand cars in Shanghai. These include privately owned cars, taxis, privately owned transport vehicles, and for-hire transport vehicles. The distinction between private cars and taxis can be seen on the "license plate"; the former has white characters on a black background, while the latter has black characters on a white background. As for the distinction of transport vehicles, those privately owned also have white characters on a black background, while those for hire have white characters on a yellow background.

Every day we see car license plate numbers in the tens, hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands, both above and below. However, we have never seen a car with license plate number one. So, does license plate number one exist? Yes, it does! It is said that the owner of the license plate is named Zhou. This license plate number one was issued as early as the beginning of the Republic of China, which shows that the Zhou family was already very wealthy back then. Of course, there is only one of these earliest license plate number one. There will never be a second one, so it is very valuable. Its owner also regards it as a rare treasure, believing it brings them a lot of prestige. However, the car bearing this license plate number one is already an "old car," so it is now kept in the garage and never taken out. The owner of this "old car," in order to keep license plate number one, has never missed a quarterly payment; otherwise, the license plate number one would be revoked by the vehicle administration office.

Not just anyone can drive a car. Car drivers all have a driver's license. This type of driver's license must be obtained after passing two rigorous examinations. Currently, driver's licenses have been issued to over twenty thousand. It is said that the person who obtained the first driver's license was nicknamed Little Mei Lang. His name is unknown. Little Mei Lang passed away long ago. During his lifetime, he drove a car for the wealthy Jewish businessman Hardoon. At that time, there was also a story related to car license plate number one:

Because Hardoon only had driver number one but no car number one, he once asked someone to speak to the Zhou family, willing to pay a large sum of money to purchase their car license plate number one. The Zhou family humorously replied, "Hardoon wants car license plate number one because he has driver number one, preparing to have two number ones; while we have car license plate number one. Since Hardoon already has driver number one, then we would rather pay a special wage to hire a driver number one..." The result, of course, left Mr. Hardoon with regret in his grave. In Shanghai, scheming over car license plates is also a common phenomenon, such as similar number positions or consecutive numbers. This is probably the so-called "decorative beauty," right? At the same time, there are indeed some people who use riding in a car as "decorative beauty," but in reality, they are "empty big shot officials."
