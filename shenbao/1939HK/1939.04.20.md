### The Supreme Leader's Determined Declaration

The ultimate victory in every war is certainly determined, on the one hand, by the arduous struggles of the general populace. On the other hand, however, the supreme leader is the main factor in striving for that final victory. Our nation's war of resistance against Japan was launched only after enduring until the "final moment." Therefore, our victory was calculated long ago. The supreme leader foresaw the situation today as early as five years ago, so we are absolutely confident in our victory. During the course of the war of resistance, the supreme leader has often declared this confidence to China and the world, which is of extremely great significance in striving for victory.

On the 17th, the supreme leader once again answered questions from Chinese and foreign journalists regarding the war of resistance. Although it was only a few sentences, he dissected the bright future of our inevitable victory against Japan very clearly. The most important point was to elucidate the poisonous scheme concocted by the × people in collusion with Chinese traitors. The most concrete conspiracy of the × people recently to annex China was Konoe's declaration to "establish a new order in East Asia," and a portion of the Chinese people even regarded this poisonous scheme as a tempting bait. In this conversation, the supreme leader first shattered this erroneous notion. He refuted it well: "If Konoe's statement is interpreted as a 'peace' that can be regarded as an acceptable condition, then there is no need for the word 'surrender' in the dictionary. This is an extremely shameless joke." Even today, there are still many spies making shameless assertions and interpretations. The supreme leader's refutation also has great significance in terms of political strategy.

Secondly, he strengthened his consistent proposition and reiterated that "the purpose of China's war of resistance is to defend the survival, independence, and freedom of the entire nation. Until this goal is achieved, our struggle will not stop for a single day." In the previous few days, when the British ambassadors to China and Japan gathered in Shanghai for discussions, many people inevitably speculated wildly. At that time, we determined with an extremely firm tone that the purpose of the Shanghai meeting was only to discuss how Britain could help China in its war of resistance. As expected, Britain has now continued to lend huge sums of money to China. The leader's statement this time can further dispel many groundless suspicions.

Thirdly, the future of our war of resistance victory depends on self-confidence and optimism. The × people are now quite tired from fighting. The internal contradictions not only exist between the upper and lower classes, but also within their upper echelons. The main reason for this is that the aggressive war is not progressing as desired. The Sino-Japanese War not only failed to end within a year and a half as predicted by the Japanese General Staff, but the × people have not even achieved our own "lenient" expectations. The × people have now fallen from a first-rate country to a second-rate country, and if they continue to fight, they will not even be able to maintain the strength of a second-rate country. The rapid invasion war of twenty-two months resulted in the occupation of only a few "empty cities." This is not only our own boast. It is reported that the British ambassador also questioned Doihara, the head of the Japanese special affairs agency, about this point, and Doihara was speechless. The panic of the × people has reached its extreme. Just as their temporary victory has reached its highest point, they will then begin to decline. The beginning of the decline of the × people is also the beginning of our final victory. I must have firm self-confidence to implement and advance the development of the victory phase.

However, the increase in our war of resistance strength and the greater certainty of final victory have recently also been manifested in the increasingly favorable shift in the international situation for us and unfavorable for ×. On the one hand, Japan, the Eastern aggressor, does not dare to rashly join the even more advanced military alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, exposing the deepening crisis of Japan's international isolation. On the other hand, the efforts of countries around the world that love peace to conclude an (anti-aggression front) due to the even greater expansionist actions of the two fierce countries, Germany and Italy, have gradually yielded concrete results. The improvement in Britain's attitude towards the Soviet Union and the proposed military cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can not only prevent the advance of German and Italian aggressors, but also weaken the ferocity of the Eastern aggressors. In the United States, after President Roosevelt put forward a "peace plan" to Germany and Italy and was severely rejected by Hitler and Mussolini, the possibility of his active participation in the "anti-aggression front" has gradually become a reality. Its development is of course not limited to Europe. In the near future, the sanctions of various countries against the Eastern aggressors will become more concrete. If Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union can cooperate effectively in the Pacific, the brutality of the Eastern aggressors can be easily stopped. It is said that no matter in what way a world war breaks out, the United States, at a minimum, will impose a blockade of resources and military supplies on the aggressors and provide the anti-aggression countries with the conveniences they need for war. What the Eastern aggressors fear most is this effective non-war sanction.

If we can utilize this favorable international situation at present and can further promote this situation through effort, then the future of the war of resistance is absolutely optimistic. Please pay attention, traitors who are "willing to be slaves of Japan," after reading this speech by the supreme leader, do not engage in shameless counter-propaganda anymore!

### The 12th Anniversary of the Society for Life Education

— Wei Dongming

At 2 p.m. on March 15th, a white cloth banner hung above the entrance to the Chongqing Social Hall, with the large characters: The 12th Anniversary of the Society for Life Education. Many senior gentlemen greeted each other and walked into the venue, giving affectionate smiles to the children who were marching in formation.

The characteristic of this venue was that it did not have the characteristics of an educators' gathering. The guests included men, women, old, and young, from all walks of life and all levels of society. The order of the meeting proceeded according to general custom. What was different was that it did not seem like a customary procedure. The sound of the national anthem being sung was neat and high-pitched, making people feel excited upon hearing it.

The large venue was filled with about 1,500 people. Mr. Huang Yanpei, the chairman, delivered a short and powerful opening speech.

"...The purpose of the Society for Life Education is expressed in its name. Life education is education for life, using life to educate, and giving education to life. The mistake of some people in the past was to separate education and life. Mr. Tao and the friends of the Society for Life Education are correcting this point, starting from this point. Today is the 12th anniversary of the Society for Life Education. What is different from twelve years ago is that today we are in the period of resisting the war and building the nation. We think of the soldiers at the front, shedding blood and killing ×, and the compatriots in various places, wandering in hardship. How heavy is our responsibility? How can we be worthy of them? When reading Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, we must silently resolve to work hard, everyone rise up, 'awaken the masses,' and use education to change life. Therefore, life education has an even greater mission in the war of resistance. However, the principle cannot be known without being practiced. The founder of the Society for Life Education, Mr. Tao, originally named Zhixing, which means to know and act immediately. Now he is renamed Xingzhi, which means to act on what you know. 'Zhixing Xingzhi' can be used as the motto of the Society for Life Education. Now let us listen to Mr. Tao's report, then we can know the painstaking efforts and achievements of the Society for Life Education in the past twelve years."

Then, Mr. Tao Xingzhi, the chairman of the society, immediately gave a relatively long report.

"...There are many children in the venue today, which makes me think that the birthday of the Society for Life Education is also a birthday for the children. The scene twelve years ago is like a photo gathered in front of my eyes. At that time, a group of young people went to the countryside, barefoot, wearing straw sandals, to live with the villagers. We did not bring cultural relief supplies for disaster relief: we brought a heart. A humble heart to study how to develop education to meet China's needs. When these young people were with the farmers, there were two discoveries. For more than ten years, the young people had received what Xunzi called 'three-inch education,' 'the distance between the mouth and ears is one inch.' We use our eyes, mouths, and ears every day, forgetting to use our hands. The hand is only used to hold a pen and write. After going to the countryside, we learned to use our hands from the farmers. We discovered that we can use our hands to farm, to work, to take up guns to defeat Japanese ××-ism! (This caused a burst of enthusiastic applause.)

'The second discovery was on the part of the farmers. In the past, they received 'fist education' of 'the people can be made to follow, but not to know.' Now, through contact with the young people, they have rediscovered their brains. The young people discovered their hands, and the farmers discovered their brains. To defeat Japanese ××-ism, implement the Three Principles of the People, and create a new China, we must rely on using both hands and brains! (This was another burst of applause.)

'What have we done in the past twelve years? We have done three things, all of which have not yet been completed. Perhaps it will take several years or decades to complete them. The first is to oppose Westernized education. This does not oppose foreign knowledge, but opposes Westernized habits and forms. To run education, you must build a Western-style building. Once you Westernize, it costs hundreds of thousands or millions. A small number of people are educated, and the majority cannot receive education. The second is to oppose traditional education, oppose reading as a ladder to promotion and wealth, and oppose transcendent education that is for education's sake. The common people spend money to let others read dead books, but they themselves do not know a single character. We opposed this twelve years ago, and we still oppose it today, because the first does not care about the survival of the nation, and the second is that only young ladies and young masters can read. The above two points are negative. The third point is that we must establish education for a semi-colonial country to strive for freedom and equality! (Applause) This education cannot be copied from Britain and the United States, but must be created from our own soil. Twelve years ago, we created this education. What is this education? It roughly has the following points. (1) It is not a toy or ornament, nor a ladder to promotion and wealth, but a weapon, a weapon for national liberation and human liberation. (2) It is scientific. It must be based on the Chinese environment and be able to strive for the survival of the nation, not just copying and copying. And its content includes science. (3) It is life. All education must go through life. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said: 'The life of the war of resistance is the life of the modern age.' With the life of the war of resistance, there is the education of the war of resistance. It is not enough to just talk about the education of the war of resistance. We must use the life of the war of resistance to educate. (4) It is for the masses. The entire nation must be educated and fight together to defeat Japanese ××-ism! Mass education must save money so that those without money can receive education. Second, it must save time so that those without time can receive education. (5) It is planned. From a semi-colonial country to striving for liberation, we must distinguish between what is important and what is less important, and distinguish between what comes first and what comes later. These are the kinds of education we hope for.

'In the future, our work, first, is to continue the previous work, opposing Westernization and opposing tradition, and continue to establish the education for a new China that strives for freedom and equality. Recently, I visited a factory. The things used in this factory used to have to be purchased from foreign countries. Now, because they cannot be purchased, they have been made by themselves. A famous engineer built a factory without using steel and cement. In the field of education, they are now being discovered in thatched huts and mountain caves. However, those who teach dead books, those who teach books to death, those teaching bookworms who teach, those who read dead books, those who read books to death, those who are cultural peddlers, and those who are knowledge compradors are still everywhere. In the countryside, anemia is rampant, and there are very few cultural programs going to the countryside. Education is still for a small number of people. Therefore, we must continue to work hard. However, there has been a change in attitude. We do not only criticize, but also help each other and work together.

'Second, we must take on the current tasks. The war of resistance has launched a full-scale war of resistance, and education must also be launched as full-scale education. Spread it to the front lines, the rear, the frontiers, the rear of the × people, everywhere. Everyone must divide the work and cooperate, go to the northwest, go to Yunnan and Guizhou, go to the war zones to educate the wounded soldiers and the common people, and go to the rear of the × people to smash the conspiracies of the × people. Third, we must increase our strength and enrich our strength. First, we must establish research institutes to seek advanced knowledge. Everyone should grasp a problem and continue to study it. Not only study by ourselves, but also help everyone to progress together. Second, the Society for Life Education is ashamed to say that for twelve years it has only been an informal organization. It was only formally established last December. In the future, we must strengthen the organization in order to make progress ourselves and become a force in society. The Society for Life Education must divide the work and cooperate like a factory, it must be mass-based, it must be school-based, it must be democratic, and it must teach each other and learn together. We must become a large industry-study group! We must work, we must learn, and we must unite!

'Finally, I thank everyone for coming to participate. On this anniversary, we swear to contribute all our spirit and strength to the great cause of resisting the war and building the nation! '

A burst of applause sent Mr. Tao off the stage. The next item was a speech by a guest. When the master of ceremonies announced that Mr. Zou Taofen would give a speech, enthusiastic applause resounded from the audience. Mr. Zou told the children interesting stories about Mr. Tao, decorating the birthday of the Society for Life Education. Then the whole audience stood up and sang the Hoe Song. Next, Old Lady Zhao gave a speech. She said that she was grateful to the Society for Life Education for imparting knowledge to the common people. Again, the "Korean Youth March 1st Drama Troupe" performed songs as an "interlude" to the conference. Several foreign songs were an encouragement from friendly countries to us. Although everyone did not understand them, they received an even greater emotion than from songs that were understood.

Mr. Dong Biwu was welcomed onto the stage amidst applause. He said that education in Japan and other capitalist countries is separated from the majority of the people. He also said that although our education is not bankrupt, it is far from meeting the needs. Farmers can also use their brains, but they do not use them systematically. Life education is just right to correct these shortcomings. Mr. Dong also said that although the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region does not have the term life education, it is basically the same as Mr. Tao's method. For example, it only took two months to mobilize women to farm. Also, the small teacher system is fully applied there. Finally, Mr. Dong said that in the past, life education did not become national due to political environment reasons. He hoped that it could be studied nationally and developed nationally in the future.

The last guest speaker was Master Xirao Jiacuo of Tibet. His words were spoken to everyone by a translator next to him. He spoke about the importance of life education, especially during the war of resistance. He hoped that everyone would rise up to support it so that life education could be universally developed in the border areas, the interior, and the war zones.

After that, the entertainment program began. The Children's Drama Troupe, the July 7th Youth Drama Troupe, the War Child Service Troupe, the First Children's Care Institute, the Temporary Care Institute, and Shude Elementary School. Children from the Morning Propaganda Team, many children performing songs, dances, dramas, stories, and the children from the Temporary Children's Care Institute performing 'Little Cats,' wearing paper cat heads, catching several children wearing paper windmill heads. The whole play was all singing and dancing. The July 7th Youth Drama Troupe's chorus of war of resistance songs was very neat and wonderful. The Children's Drama Troupe, in its position as the eldest brother among the children's groups, performed mature and skilled theatrical techniques, which could be a model for other children's groups. The achievements of these children on the stage caused bursts of applause and laughter from the children and adults in the audience. These war-related entertainment programs filled the conference with the atmosphere of celebrating a birthday during wartime.

### Letter to Comrades of the Society for Life Education

— Tao Xingzhi

Written for the 12th Anniversary of the Life Education Movement

My beloved comrades!

March 15th is a day worth commemorating. Every year on this day, everyone has many ideas to exchange. Since I returned to China, I have been busy establishing new businesses. Only a few comrades have corresponded, and even then, due to time constraints, I have not written freely. In the past six months, I have been to many places, but I have only met a few comrades. Now I want to take advantage of this 12th anniversary to say everything I want to say in my heart, hoping that everyone will guide me, and I hope that everyone will also tell me everything that has happened since we parted, so that I can have a deeper understanding of everyone's work. Let us establish our common belief in this understanding to exert our strength.

We have met in this great era, and we are continuing to fight together. How fortunate this is! Some people do not see it this way. On the return ship to India last August, a female student told me: "This time we returned to China, it is very different from when we went abroad. The schools are gone, the factories are gone, the families are gone, relatives and friends are displaced, and the teacher cannot help but feel sad, right?" I said: "In the country, what we can see may be ten times or a hundred times worse than what you said, but I have no sadness at all. It is indeed a very different China. It has fists. It has stood up. It is true that it is bleeding a lot. But like a mother giving birth, the result of bleeding is the birth of a new life. The blood we see in China is no longer the blood of mutual slaughter, but the blood of fighting Japanese ××-ism desperately. In this great torrent of blood, a great, free, and equal Republic of China will emerge." I remember that on the anniversary of the May 30th Massacre, I said at the Xiaozhuang Association: "If the education run by Xiaozhuang cannot help China drive out Japanese ××-ism, it will be considered a failure." From the beginning, we recognized the arrival of the great era, and this great era must be created by the blood of the Chinese people and all anti-aggression comrades.

From the letters from comrades in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Guizhou, Gansu, Hong Kong, Annam, Singapore, and Europe and the United States, I know that everyone is contributing their strength to the Chinese nation in their respective positions. In the rear, in the front, overseas, and in the rear of the × people, everyone is working very hard and earnestly fulfilling their responsibilities. Our number is small, but almost everyone has been mobilized. Everyone is unreservedly contributing their sweat, blood, or brains. I cannot deny that there are also a small number of comrades who are hesitating and lagging behind due to insufficient understanding. But the majority are creating in this great era, exerting their small strength with unyielding efforts. One letter especially made me unforgettable. It used the four words "Welcome Difficulty" to encourage me to return to the country. I think that these four words should not be appreciated alone, but should be given to all comrades as a motto. Napoleon said that there was no word "difficult" in his dictionary. Even invading Russia was not difficult, so he was completely defeated. Wang Jingwei said that there was no word "easy" in his dictionary. He was afraid that resisting Japan would not be easy, so he wavered and compromised. These are all overcorrections. In fact, there are both difficult and easy words in the dictionary. We must not underestimate or be afraid of difficulties. The four words "Welcome Difficulty" just express the attitude we should have. No one can deny that China is going through a difficult time. Since difficulties are constantly coming, then solve one when it comes, and solve a pair when two come. If each of us has this spirit of "Welcoming Difficulty," we will be able to take on our tasks and exert our contributions even better. (To be continued)

### The Current Situation of the New Provincial Capital of Xikang (2)

Shanxi Pilgrimage Kangding is located on a plateau more than 8,700 feet above sea level, surrounded by the mountains of Paoma, Guoda, and Erpo, with towering peaks and year-round snow cover at high altitudes. The city is in a valley, bisected by the Zheduo River, with a mix of Han and Tibetan people, stacked stones for houses, and markets along the river. Goods from Sichuan, Tibet, and central Kang are mostly concentrated here, with tea, medicinal materials, and furs being the major items of trade. In previous years, the urban area was extremely cold. In winter, icicles hung down from the roofs of the houses, like glazed pillars. Merchants had to break these ice barriers every morning before displaying their goods for business. Since the establishment of the provincial government this year, the population has surged, and the climate has changed, no longer as strangely cold as in previous years. However, because it is surrounded by mountains, the air is not regulated. Every afternoon, violent winds rise. If they blow head-on, not only is breathing obstructed, but even cattle and sheep are often knocked over. On the first day of the abolished lunar calendar, the reporter made a city-wide pilgrimage, casually observing the customs and exotic traditions of this borderland. Descending from Erpo Mountain, entering Zhongzheng Street, the snow had just cleared and the spring chill was biting. The snow on the mountains reflected light, dazzling the eyes. Looking up at the summit of Haizi Mountain (there is a lake on the summit, rarely visited due to the high altitude), the snow and mist were faint, and the clouds and sky were indistinguishable. The cawing of crows added to the border melancholy. Arriving at the market, shops on both sides were covered with Spring Festival couplets, all closed for business, because the people clung to old habits, and the lunar calendar was still difficult to abolish. That day (the 19th) happened to be the fifth anniversary of the New Life Movement. All institutions, legal entities, schools, and shops hung national flags to celebrate. Residents, whether Han or Tibetan, men or women, mostly wore new clothes and exchanged New Year greetings. Turning east, crossing the Zhong Bridge, to Zhongshan Street, along the way, Tibetan men were seen wearing newly made large leather robes, with sleeves almost reaching the ground, tied with wide belts, and money pouches, wearing leather hats and long leather boots, going back and forth to celebrate the New Year. Turning west from Zhongshan Road, crossing the Upper Bridge, turning to Laosha Street, arriving in front of the Gospel Hall, many Tibetan women were seen, newly adorned, wearing wide long robes, with wide belts around their waists, their hair braided and coiled on their heads, tied with red ropes, long earrings dangling, inlaid with ornaments, and keys hanging from their waists. Because it was the abolished New Year, their faces were painted with powder and rouge, vying for beauty and showing off to each other. Next to the street, people were throwing dice, gathering to gamble, with gongs and drums sounding loudly, occasionally mixed with the sound of firecrackers. There were those who played the erhu and sang Peking opera. Arriving at the North Gate, it gradually became desolate. In the middle of Zhongzheng Park, the scene was bleak, with nothing to see. Returning west, entering the General's Temple, going straight into the main hall, the incense in front of the statues was thick and smoky, making it difficult to open one's eyes. A young woman was seen kneeling in front of the gods, seeking a fortune. In a small room on the east side, an old monk sat cross-legged, beating a drum and cymbals, chanting scriptures. Among them were Han and Tibetan children, playing with money. At the entrance of the temple, several male beggars were begging. The Spring Festival couplets pasted on the door were all in Tibetan. After the tour, turning from Zhuge Street, climbing up Erpo Mountain to return. Just arriving at the residence, another snowstorm began.

Bird's-Eye View of Ethnic Groups The ethnic groups in Kangding are extremely complex. There are many people from Sichuan, Yunnan, Shaanxi, and Shanxi, and occasionally missionaries from Britain and France lurking among them. In addition, there are native Han Chinese and indigenous people. The indigenous people are mostly Tibetans, including Tibetans, Kang people, Yi people, and Xifan people. There are also mixed bloodlines such as Kang Tibetan and Han Kang. The Hui and Mongolian ethnic groups are all guest residents. Tibetans living in the city are commonly called Manjia. Kang people are called Kangba, speaking the Kang language and using Tibetan script. Their customs, habits, clothing, and lifestyle still maintain their inherent characteristics. Only a small number have assimilated with the Han Chinese. The lives of wealthy families are also quite comfortable, with household utensils mostly the same as those of the Han Chinese, except they only eat buttered tea and fresh rice. The poor rely on their own labor. Women in the city mostly carry tea packages and goods, collect firewood and carry water, and sell them to earn a living. Men in the countryside engage in agriculture, industry, commerce, and various other occupations. Women also do various kinds of labor. Housing is extremely dirty, sitting on the ground and sleeping with clothes as bedding. The uncleanliness of their habits makes one feel like vomiting when sitting with them. The entire county has only over 30,000 residents. In the urban area, according to a recent survey by the preparatory office of the Provincial Capital Police Department, there are 73 native households, with 675 men and 419 women, of which mining is the most common occupation, followed by handicrafts, and commerce is the least common. Guozhuang accounts for 31 households (Guozhuang is the name of the business run by Kang people for lodging and warehousing). There are 2,375 guest households, with 6,568 men and 5,687 women, with commerce being the most common occupation, followed by industry, mining, and transportation. There are five foreign households, with eight men and nine women, including three Britons, four Americans, and nine French, and one Nepalese national. Most of them are missionaries from the Catholic Church and the Gospel Hall, followed by doctors from Anxi Retreat and other hospitals. Statistics show that the city has a total of 2,453 native, guest, and foreign households, with 13,366 men and women.

Cultural Level Kangding is located on the border, very different from the interior. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the Tusi system was abolished and schools were established. Because education has not been popularized, everything is backward. In terms of culture, apart from the Five Vidyas, there is no scholarship; apart from Buddhism, there is no thought. All family and social life and folk customs are dominated by Buddhism. Where there are temples, culture follows. The Kang people have believed in Buddhism for a long time and are devout. The minds and bodies of all are tied to this. Their lives are happy to be otherworldly. The Five Vidyas are the basis of culture. Ordinary people are not skilled in production, and intellectuals are not interested in politics. All external thoughts, academics, and modern culture cannot be instilled. Therefore, the consciousness of the masses is still under the control of theocracy. The cultural level can be imagined. There is only one provincial normal school in Kangding's secondary schools. In addition, the Central Political Branch School has an attached simple normal department and a middle school department. The Department of Education recently plans to establish a middle school in Luding, which is being prepared and is expected to open next month. There are one provincial and one county primary school. In addition, there is a Chunhua Primary School established by the Catholic Church, with insidious intentions of cultural aggression. Only a small number of children who rely on the church for a living study there. As for civil education centers, libraries, and reading rooms, they are simple and crude due to financial constraints. Local publications include Xikang News, which publishes one issue a day and is sold throughout the county. The Xikang News Agency is attached to the Xichui News Agency, but its manuscripts have not been seen. In addition, there is Kangdao Monthly, which is sponsored by the Suding County Training and Tongxue Association. Only three issues have been published, and the fourth issue has not been seen for a long time.

Relief Movement

Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the border areas, in view of the frenzied invasion of Japanese warlords, have also launched anti-Japanese movements. Various cultural groups, under the upsurge of national salvation, have worked harder to publicize national liberation, such as through written communication and drama movements. Although they have not spread to every corner of the frontier, they have also achieved considerable results. The earliest national salvation group established in Kangding was the All Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association, but it was disbanded soon after due to the unsound internal organization. Subsequently, a mobilization committee was formed to promote national salvation work. On the women's side, there was the Kangding Women's Wartime Education Promotion Committee, which set up women's education and training classes, with Ms. Yang Yunguang, the chairman's wife, as the head of the class, which was quite effective. In terms of religion, there was the Xikang Provincial Branch of the China Muslim National Salvation Association, with more than 100 members, all of whom were Muslims. The Xikang Provincial Party Department, in view of the urgent need for a sound organization to lead and promote the work of national salvation, recently convened a meeting of people from all walks of life and planned to restore the Anti-Japanese Support Association. The principle has been passed and it will be reorganized and re-established soon.

Lama Life Kang Tibet has established the country based on Buddhism for more than a thousand years. Its people, regardless of men, women, old or young, regard Buddhism as the highest religion. In Kang custom, if there are three sons, two must become lamas, and one will inherit the family business. If there are two sons and daughters, one will be given to a Han Chinese as a son-in-law to manage the family affairs, and his son will enter the temple as a monk. Their intention is: Our master is Buddha. If I become a lama, Buddha will bless me, remove my illness, and relieve my suffering. Moreover, since the son is the highest-ranking person, no one dares to deceive me, and his life can be solved. In one corner of Luding City, there are seven lama temples, namely Anjue Temple, Nanwu Temple, Duoji Temple, Sakya Temple, Yigong Temple, Eba Temple, and Duozha Temple. Statistics show that there are about 200 lamas in the city, mostly from the Yellow Sect, followed by the Red Sect. Each temple is controlled by a senior lama, known as a Khenpo or Buddha Governor, respectively. The Kang people regard the position and power of the senior lama as equal to that of Han officials. Whenever they see the senior lama traveling, regardless of men or women, they take off their hats, loosen their hair, and stand respectfully to the side to pay their respects. If they can have the senior lama touch their heads, they will consider it a lifetime of good fortune. As for the importance attached to lama temples, it goes without saying. The lamas in each temple make a living by chanting sutras. Whenever someone in a family dies or is sick, they must ask a lama to chant sutras to eliminate sins, paying one or two or three yuan a day. Wealthy families invite Khenpo or Buddhist governors to chant sutras, and they pay with mules, horses, and other things. Their way of chanting sutras is different from that of Han monks, such as sending ghosts. Sending ghosts is mostly done in the morning. At that time, many lamas sit around the field, blowing pythons, trumpets, and lamas, making a loud noise. They also beat drums and cymbals to match the rhythm. In the middle, there are two lamas with towering copper hats, holding hadas in their hands, acting as conductors. When one waves, the rhythm of the drums and trumpets changes immediately. First, they come out of the sutra hall in single file, and then go around the temple for a week before returning to sit. Then they form a team and go to the suburbs, and arrive at the destination, like shamans in the interior jumping on the altar, and then cremate their silk clothes and the figures of people, birds, and beasts they made. That is the ghost that is being sent away. There are also those who knead dough into various ferocious ghost shapes and choose a day to throw them into the wild dam. Wealthy families often carry guns and live ammunition to shoot at the dough ghosts until they are hit, and the rest stab with knives. Lamas do not go to the homes of the people to recite sutras, but recite and learn scriptures in the temple, with rhythms in all sentences, and beat drums and cymbals to show the rhythm. Occasionally passing by the temple, the sound is murmuring. Lamas eat four or five meals a day, eating zanba when hungry, and drinking tea and butter tea, all provided by the temple. On the 23rd, the reporter went to Eba Temple to visit. The temple belongs to the Red Sect and is located at the foot of Erpo Mountain. Troops are stationed in the temple. Led by a young lama, he went upstairs and visited his master, the senior lama. The senior lama, a Kang person, has a dark complexion, about fifty years old, wearing a foreign leather cassock, with his right arm exposed outside his clothes, sitting cross-legged on the futon. Seeing the reporter arrive, he gestured for him to sit down. He did not know the Han language, and I did not understand the Tibetan language. He asked his apprentice to translate the meaning of the visit. He got up slowly and poured a cup of buttered tea to offer me. I thanked him and drank a little of it, which tasted strongly muttony. Soon someone came to pay a New Year's visit. The reporter stood up to visit the statues of the gods, and saw that there were many gods enshrined, with solemn faces, mostly made of gold. In addition to bowing to each god one by one, the New Year's visitor finally kowtowed to the senior lama, who sat and accepted it. After the reporter finished the visit, he immediately said goodbye, and his apprentice sent him to the gate before parting.

### Gangbei Besieges Wuning; Offense in Hunan Has Not Made Progress; Battles Expand in Shanxi, Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui

[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Chongqing on the 19th] The Jiangxi battle has not changed. Fierce fighting continues in the mountain area west of Liangjiadu. We have wiped out hundreds of enemy troops in recent days.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 19th] After our troops attacking Wuning occupied the important strongholds of Chaping, Xinkailing, Shili Mountain, and Guanyinge in the northwest of the county seat on the 18th, they formed a three-sided encirclement of the area. At 1:00 a.m. on the 19th, they further reduced the encirclement and began to attack the city, which is currently in fierce fighting.

[Special dispatch from this newspaper in Chongqing on the 19th] It is reported that the enemy in Henan is extremely panicked due to repeated attacks by our forces. In Kaifeng, the enemy and our forces are facing each other in Xianrenzhuang and Baimugang. Thousands of enemy troops in Xinyang are still fighting fiercely with our forces in Xianshan in the western suburbs.

[Reuters, Beijing, 18th] The war in Shanxi is becoming increasingly fierce. The war has now shifted north and is moving towards the central part of Shanxi Province. The war in northern Henan and central Hebei is still continuing. It seems that neither side has gained anything.

[Reuters, Beijing, 19th] According to Japanese official reports, the Soviet Union is currently assisting Chinese troops in attacking southern Shanxi. A Japanese spokesman said that the artillery of the Chinese troops on this line has adopted Soviet tactics and firing methods. When asked whether this was a Soviet-trained Chinese army, the spokesman replied that he believed that Russians were involved in the Chinese artillery team. In addition, there were four fierce battles in North China, two near Baoding, one south of Kaifeng, and another northeast of Beijing.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 19th] Chinese guerrillas clashed with Japanese troops stationed in Hongqiao near the foreign residential area in western Shanghai last night, exchanging fire. Machine gun fire could be heard clearly. More than an hour later, the Chinese guerrillas retreated westward. It is said that the guerrillas numbered about 300. The losses on both sides are unknown.

[Central News Agency, Ningguo, 18th] Our thousands of troops on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui launched a large-scale counter-offensive again on the 16th. Fierce battles have been taking place in Tuan Mountain, Jiuli Mountain (both north of Xuanzhou), and Jiangxizhen (south of Wanzhi) in recent days. The enemy in Wanzhi has been increasing to thousands, defending against our attack on Wuhu.

### One Week's War Situation - April 14th to 19th - Released by the Military Affairs Commission

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th] A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that our troops in various theaters have recently achieved significant results. The enemy is exhausted and panicked. Especially since this week, successive successes have been achieved, with great victories and many recoveries, which have shocked domestic and foreign audiences. This trend of victory is gradually unfolding, and the enemy's attempt to struggle desperately has been completely shattered. Although the Japanese enemy has wantonly spread rumors and concealed its failures, the facts speak louder than words, and those with knowledge will naturally know it. The course of the battle is described as follows:

Guangdong Front

Our troops in Guangdong have been attacking the enemy fiercely with the momentum of a broken bamboo, making rapid progress. Since the morning of the 13th, Dongting has divided into four routes to encircle and attack Zengcheng. By noon, the important passes of Zhuguling in the north of the city, Shetouling in the west, and Pingfengling in the east were occupied by our forces, and troops were divided to cut off the connection line between the enemy south of the city and Shitan in Guangzhou. The enemy's reinforcements were defeated. By the evening, the vanguard troops rushed into the city through the north and south gates. The enemy resisted stubbornly, and the street fighting was extremely fierce. By about 2:00 a.m. the next morning, the remnants were completely wiped out, and the county seat was officially recovered, with more than 1,000 enemy troops killed. In the past two days, with the remaining power of the victory, they continued to advance towards Guangzhou. The sound of artillery can already be heard in Guangzhou. After the Beijiang army conquered Huaxian, on the 16th, the allied forces and the strong troops of the Tian area bravely attacked and recovered Xinjie, and took advantage of the situation to advance towards Guangzhou, only 12 miles away from Guangzhou by noon yesterday. On the Xijiang front, our troops approached the Sanshao Buddha Mountain on the 15th and 16th, and are currently besieging it. The enemy's major strongholds in Guangdong are Zengcheng in Dongjiang, Huaxian in Beijiang, and Sanshui in Xijiang. So far, the northeast strongholds have been completely brought under our control. The transportation on the Guangzhou-Kowloon, Yuehan, and Guangzhou-Sanshui lines has also been completely controlled. The encirclement of Guangzhou has been largely completed, and the enemy trapped in the isolated city of Guangzhou has been cut off from its retreat and is already in a desperate situation, extremely panicked, and is scrambling to escape.

Henan Front

The enemy in Henan Province has been subjected to our army's continued general offensive this week, which has developed into a major annihilation battle. In central Henan, our army rushed into Kaifeng on Tuesday (the 11th) and Wednesday (the 12th), wiping out more than 2,000 enemy troops. The enemy's important base in the Central Plains was occupied by us twice. This week, we continued to attack with the remaining courage. On the evening of the 14th, our large army returned to Nanguan. The enemy urgently transferred more than 2,000 reinforcements from the Longhai Railway, who were intercepted by our forces in the Nandi area after getting off the train. A fierce battle for control ensued. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties and dead bodies piled up like mountains. At the same time, another part of our army took advantage of the victory to conquer the county seat of Tongxu and divided its troops to cut off the Longhai Railway. The remnant enemy in Kaifeng has no way to retreat and is struggling to hold on. Our army besieging Xinyang in southern Henan has completely swept away the line on the east side of the city. This week, the enemy stubbornly resisting in the northwest suburbs of the city launched a fierce attack from Shijiatian, but was met with a head-on attack, killing more than 600 enemy troops. The enemy collapsed and fled in panic. By noon on the 14th, after our forces recovered Shijiabai and Zhujiatian, they occupied Xianshan, three or four miles west of the city, with the momentum of a violent storm, forcing the remnant enemy to retreat into the city. Changtaiguan, the enemy's retreating rear, has also been surrounded by our forces. On the 14th and 15th, we rushed in from the north and south gates successively, and captured a large number of prisoners. The battle for the two cities is in full swing.

Hubei Front

In order to protect the two strongholds of Yingshan and Anlu in northern Hubei, the enemy army launched several detours and counter-attacks against our troops approaching the county seat on the 14th and 15th. After several days of fierce fighting at Haojiadian, Yujiadian and other places, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and collapsed across the board. After a vigorous pursuit, we killed more than 1,000 enemy troops. The two county towns are still under our siege. The enemy forces in Zhongxiang and Zhoudian in central Hubei, as well as the strongholds of Jiaodian, Xinjicun, and Siyangzizhen, have been launching counter-attacks from the city several times this week after being recovered last week, but they have all been repulsed. The enemy has suffered great sacrifices. Now only more than 600 enemy troops remain and can be completely wiped out. The enemy forces west of Yuekou who are trying to reinforce Zhongxiang towards Heimudu were suddenly attacked by our army on the dawn of the 17th. The enemy resisted stubbornly and fought bloody battles for two days and one night. By the evening of the 18th, the enemy army was completely wiped out, with more than 1,000 infantry and more than 100 cavalry killed, and more than 100 horses and more than 10 light and heavy machine guns captured. We are now taking advantage of the victory to advance towards Yuekou. At the same time, our army that recovered Yuxinhe attacked the western suburbs of Tianmen at noon on the 16th. The enemy is trapped in the county and is on the verge of collapse. Our large army crossing the river has been arriving continuously. The enemy forces east of the Xiang River will have nowhere to bury themselves.

Shanxi Front

Our attacking troops in southern Shanxi have launched large-scale sweeps in the vicinity of Xia County and Wenxi County, with great results. On the 15th, more than 1,000 enemy troops were reinforced from Anyun to Xia County. After being attacked from different routes, more than half of the enemy troops were killed, and the remnant enemy troops fled back to their original route. Another part of our army took advantage of the victory to successively occupy the key points of Yangshepo, Bodiguo and Jiabao in the southeast of Wenxi, and the enemy abandoned more than 700 bodies. The enemy stubbornly resisting in Zhangdianzhen and Weiguozhen fled north in disorder after being fiercely attacked on the 15th and 16th. More than 2,000 enemy troops in Jicheng in eastern Shanxi launched an attack on us on the 13th. By using mobile tactics, the enemy was cut into several sections. The enemy fled in panic to the city, and we took advantage of the victory to follow and retreat. On the morning of the 14th, the enemy abandoned the city and fled to Fushan, and was ambushed on the way, suffering heavy casualties. Yicheng and Fushan were recovered again. In addition, more than 3,000 enemy troops invaded Dongxi Moqi from the southern part of the Baijin Highway, attempting to invade Yudu. After a brave welcome, the enemy's momentum was greatly frustrated. The area was recovered on the 16th. In the Lishi Zhongyang area in western Shanxi, our army has been launching attacks this week and killed many enemy troops. The enemy's attempt to cross the river and attack west was suppressed. After besieging the enemy in Jingle in northern Shanxi for more than ten days, part of our army once rushed into the city this week. The enemy's strength was greatly depleted.

In addition, the enemy in northern Jiangxi has been under our general offensive this week. Wanshou Mountain south of Nanchang has been captured by us and is now attacking the provincial capital. Our army west of Wuning has completely defeated the enemy army in the suburbs of the city, and the four suburbs of the county are within our sphere of influence. As for our army counter-attacking Gao'an, after once occupying the county seat last week, the suburban positions have been contested several times. The remnant enemy troops are now fleeing to Fengxin and Anyi in various directions. The enemy army is extremely exhausted and has no strength to attack again. On other lines, our army once captured Bai Miao in Sui territory, killing nearly 1,000 enemy troops, and in recent days has taken advantage of the victory to attack Guyang and Yuxian, making smooth progress. We have captured Yixing in Jiangnan, Pixian and Haimen in northern Jiangsu, and Hejian and Qingyun in Hebei. The Jinpu Railway has also destroyed four large iron bridges between Taian and Gushan (southwest of Jinan), completely controlling the entire line of transportation. All are fighting stronger and stronger, like autumn wind sweeping away fallen leaves, enough to give powerful confirmation of our belief in the inevitable victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

### Enemy's List of Fallen Soldiers Announced for the Ninth Time Yesterday; Includes One Lieutenant General

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th] Tokyo Foreign News: The Japanese Ministry of the Army announced today a list of 3,187 people who participated in the war against China and died in battle or from illness, who died in battle or from illness between August 7, 1937, and December 4, 1938. The list includes one Lieutenant General Asano who died of illness. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, this is the ninth list announced.

### Zhang Xueliang is Rumored to Have Been Entrusted with an Important Position to Command the Anti-Japanese War in the Northeast

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 19th] According to unconfirmed Chinese sources, Zhang Xueliang has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese guerrilla forces in the four northeastern provinces.

### Shanghai Press's Glory! Firmly Unchanged Attitude; Enemy's Treacherous Conspiracy Fails

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 19th] The American-run Da Mei Publishing House received two threatening letters within 24 hours, warning the company to stop its opposition to the Kuomintang flag, otherwise bombs will be used against it. Da Mei Publishing House officials said that they did not have a Kuomintang flag, so the letter may refer to the Da Mei Evening News' sympathy for China and its independence from Japanese censorship, and its response to the Chongqing Spiritual Mobilization Movement.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Shanghai News: Since Xi Shitai was assassinated, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai have made unreasonable demands on the Foreign Concession Bureau. Japanese newspapers have also published crazy remarks, drumming up support for banning foreign merchant newspapers. However, because the newspapers sympathize with China's resistance against Japan and uphold justice, they will never change their attitude. In recent days, the Japanese side has even attempted to use traitors and Wang's henchmen to lure the press to drive them. It has also failed. The Japanese side is at a loss, and is now forging the names of patriotic groups to send threatening letters to various newspapers. On the morning of the 18th, various newspapers received a mimeographed letter signed by the Chinese Youth Patriotic National Salvation Group, whose wording was extremely absurd.

### Rumors Spread of Wang Jingwei Arriving in Shanghai to Plan a Puppet Central Government; Chairman Chiang's Speech Enhances Unity and Resistance Against Japan, Crushing the Traitorous and Anti-Communist Peace Conspiracy

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 19th] Well-informed sources, in light of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr's scheduled arrival in Kunming today, consider Chairman Chiang's announcement yesterday to be extremely important. Ambassador Kerr previously met with British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, in Shanghai and also held talks with other Chinese and Japanese officials. Therefore, his arrival in Kunming has, at least temporarily, created a sense of peace. Furthermore, it is widely rumored here that Wang Jingwei has arrived in Shanghai to prepare for the establishment of a "Central Government" under Japanese control. Therefore, Chairman Chiang's declaration is even more significant, as it completely refutes Wang Jingwei's words and actions and warns the Japanese government that China is determined to continue the war of resistance.

[Hong Kong News] Special dispatch from Hanoi: Since Zeng Zhongming was assassinated in Hanoi, Wang Jingwei, considering the unfavorable environment there, secretly left Hanoi for Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that Wang will be entrusted by the Japanese to publish his [missing text] articles in Shanghai, [missing text].

### Chairman Chiang's Speech Clarifies the Path to Victory

(Continued from yesterday) If we cannot eradicate their so-called "New Order in East Asia" dream, then not only will the Sino-Japanese War have absolutely no possibility of ending, but East Asia will also never have peace. Today, any Chinese descendant of the Yellow Emperor with even the slightest conscience, no matter how low their level of knowledge, would never say that Konoe's "New Order in East Asia" is not a condition for subjugating China. The ambition of the [Japanese] and the understanding of the Chinese people have already reached this point. If there are still people who argue that Konoe's statement is not a condition for the destruction of China and believe that reconciliation is still possible, this is nothing short of seeking surrender and betraying the country. Frankly speaking, such people not only do not hesitate to regard themselves as traitors but are simply willing to be slaves of Japan. (Question) How will the war situation evolve in the future? Will China continue to implement the established strategy of protracted resistance? (Answer) Five years ago, I gave a speech titled "Resisting Foreign Aggression and Reviving the Nation," which discussed our war strategy when the Sino-Japanese War broke out. You only need to read that speech to know that the strategy we are using today was decided five years ago. We will never change the overall strategy and consistent policy of "trading space for time, accumulating small victories into large ones." We decided at that time that if we do not fight, then so be it. But once we fight, we must persevere to the end. Even if all parts of the country are completely lost, we are confident and have the ability to recover them. At that time, considering the most unfavorable situation, we made a final resolution. The initial estimate was that it would take the [Japanese] eighteen months to invade our eighteen provinces. Now, we have been resisting for twenty-two months, and we are still able to maintain many complete provinces. Even the provinces that have been occupied have only lost a few provincial capitals as strongholds. In those provinces, all the land and people are still under the control of our army's sphere of influence. The [Japanese] army not only has gained nothing but is also following our planned path, falling into a quagmire and heading for collapse. Afterwards, they will be subject to our final and fatal blows at any time and in any place. Therefore, today, in terms of the overall situation of the war of resistance, we must not observe the success or failure of the war of resistance based on the gains and losses of a few provincial capital strongholds. Everyone understands our consistent policy and overall strategy, and in the future, they will no longer be deceived by the shameless traitorous theories that aim to help [the Japanese].

### Nationwide Support for the War of Resistance; Shanghai's Public Morale is High; Enthusiastic Response to Spiritual Mobilization; Residents of the Concessions Strike and Demonstrate

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 19th] Here, in response to the spiritual mobilization in Chongqing, the Kuomintang flag is hung high everywhere, leading to several minor conflicts between Chinese people and French Concession police because the French police are preventing the hanging of the Kuomintang flag. Finally, the French police began to confiscate the Kuomintang flags, and the shops that make the flags suddenly saw prosperity. It is reported that at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, there was a great need for foreign flags, but today, everyone is demanding the Kuomintang flag. According to Chinese reports, the French police insulted the Chinese national flag, leading to conflicts with the Chinese people. The owner of a certain shop decided to close the shop to protest the actions of the French police, and many people responded, leading to a strike in the main shops in the central area of the French Concession.

Shanghai Patriotic Elements Warn Traitorous Merchants

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Shanghai News: Another patriotic group has appeared in Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, two young men, carrying bombs and letters, entered the Xie Da Xiang cotton cloth shop on Avenue Mautini in the French Concession, threw the bomb into the counter, but it did not explode, then placed the letter on the counter and left calmly. Later, they threw a large number of leaflets from the roof of the Great World amusement park, stating that since the August 13th Incident, our country has been preparing for a protracted war to strive for final victory, and the people should concentrate their manpower and contribute to the country. After the National Army withdrew westward, our citizens were heartbroken and shouted to avenge the country. Unexpectedly, shameless merchants, greedy for profit, disregarded the interests of the people and willingly colluded with [the Japanese], directly providing them with economic assistance. Xie Da Xiang and other cotton cloth businesses, promote enemy goods and change their appearance to make it their business center, and after the war, they massively dumped goods [on the market] for [the Japanese], which is undoubtedly directly providing assistance to [the Japanese]. In addition to being severely punished, we hope that compatriots will carefully choose when buying clothes, not give the friendly merchants opportunities, and jointly bear the responsibility of correcting and reporting them.

### The Assassination of Zeng Zhongming (Part 1)

— Luo Zhuoming

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Hanoi Dispatch: Zeng Zhongming was seriously injured and died in Hanoi on March 21st! I know that Zeng Zhongming and Wang Jingwei have been inseparable for more than ten years, and their relationship is extremely close, virtually like Wang's right-hand man. This time, he really met with such an end, which should not be accidental.

After Wang Jingwei betrayed the country, Zeng Zhongming flew to Vietnam with Wang. Their whereabouts here were very secretive, and few outsiders knew their activities. Even so, most of the overseas Chinese here held a simple view: "Do we need to say it? Anyway, they are doing things to betray the country!"

It is said that Wang has three or four residences in Hanoi. To prevent people from detecting and assassinating him, not only is the security at each residence very strict, and they rarely go out, but also their residence is often changed very irregularly. There is a three-story building belonging to a Fujian merchant on Ruedc Colomb Street in Hanoi. The building was recently completed, with yellow-glowing paint shining from the windows. It is a very beautiful Western-style house. Although the house number has not yet been nailed, its number has been determined to be 27. Wang Jingwei and Zeng Zhongming live here. This is a quiet and clean street, where Europeans or wealthy Annamese live. Most of the houses are Western-style new buildings, surrounded by wide gardens. (To be continued)

Scene of the incident: Above: The fence of the Han-Dao residence, which was destroyed by the murderer to enter Wang's residence.

Middle: The murderer climbed the wall with wire from the brick pile. ()

Below: The arrow indicates the location where the murderer was monitoring people escaping from Wang's residence.

### Details of the Near Disaster of Eurasia Aircraft No. 19

[Central News Agency, Kaiyuan, 17th] Eurasia Airlines Mail Plane No. 19, was chased and forced to land near Hekou on the 13th. There was only one passenger on board, Li Quanmei. The reporter specially visited him tonight. He talked about the situation at that time in great detail. Mr. Li is a businessman, 35 years old. He was slightly injured when the mail plane landed, and has now gradually recovered. According to him, there were seven people on board, six of whom were Eurasia Company employees, including four Germans. The reason why the seven people were not killed this time was due to the calmness and excellent driving skills of the German pilot, Burton. On that day, the mail plane flew from Hanoi to Yunnan. At 3:15 p.m., it encountered three [Japanese] planes and chased after it. Before long, it encountered three more [Japanese] planes, totaling six. Seeing this, the pilot immediately flew the mail plane into the clouds to hide. As a result, one side chased and the other side avoided. It lasted for nearly an hour. The mail plane sometimes flew very high, but it was once attacked from above and below by six [Japanese] planes. The pilot finally used skillful driving techniques to make the plane escape the encirclement and forced it to land in a valley in the high mountains, avoiding the disaster. When I encountered the danger, I lay flat on the plane. At that time, my mood was extremely chaotic, but the sound of the [Japanese] planes shooting at the mail plane was clearly audible. The plane was hit in several places. After landing, the [Japanese] planes dropped eight bombs on it, but fortunately, the plane was only slightly damaged and can still fly after repairs. The landing site was within the boundaries of Maoping Town, only two li away from the French Annam border. The pilot's ankle was broken. Mr. Li jumped out of the plane immediately after landing, so his skin was also scratched in several places. After landing, they immediately tried to notify the Maoping Town authorities. Maoping is about ten miles away from the landing site, and the authorities were able to come to the rescue within an hour and sent them out of the country. The people on the plane walked for three days and arrived at the Fu Lin Station (transliteration, south of Lao Kai) in French Annam on the 16th. They experienced many hardships along the way. Once, they only had chicken [missing character] to fill their hunger, and they once waded through a stream that was waist-deep. After arriving in Fu Lin, I took the train to Yunnan and arrived in Kaiyuan tonight. The other people on the plane are still in Vietnam for treatment.

### The Battle of Mabu Mountain (3) (Report)

— Zhang Changren

(Continued from the 18th)

"Charge!" The brothers of the first and second companies rushed down the mountain like a storm.

The most splendid time of the sunset over Dongting Lake was also the most intense moment of the Battle of Mabu Mountain. The two sides threw grenades at each other at a distance of about twenty meters. Private Hou Haishan found a Japanese officer seven or eight meters ahead of him waving a command saber. He rushed forward for hand-to-hand combat. The [Japanese] machine gunner disregarded everything and fired at the two of them until they stopped moving, still entangled with each other. This Japanese officer was Second Lieutenant Gu San of the Tsuda Unit of the 9th Division. Pity, his woolen uniform was not as complete as our Private Hou Haishan's. His pants had three patches. In his final struggle, he pulled his feet, which were wearing two pairs of torn socks, out of his old leather shoes.

It was getting dark, the [Japanese] artillery stopped firing, and the [Japanese] machine gun dared not shout "Are you afraid?" Instead, it covered its retreat with a series of "Run, run, run, run." The brothers of the first and second companies shouted from the highlands at the foot of the mountain, "Japanese devils, see how many shells you have. Fire again and flatten the mountain so we can come and farm!"

The Japanese [missing text] gave us a rogue answer. Eight 50-kilogram gas cylinders exploded. The first three were smoke screens. Thick white smoke blew towards our position with the northeast wind. Then five were tear gas and mustard gas. Some of the brothers covered their mouths and noses with wet towels, and some wiped their tears while cursing. But at the same time, they fixed bayonets and prepared for the [Japanese] to approach.

The [Japanese] were afraid of fighting hard battles. They hurriedly dragged away the corpses in front of the阵地 and retreated in defeat.

The transport soldiers withdrew from the position to prepare to carry food. On this day, the entire third battalion did not eat a grain of rice or a drop of water. The brothers said to them with a smile, "There are still bullets and shells. Bring more grenades and mortar shells. Food is not necessary, but we need plenty of tea!"

At 10 p.m. on March 31, the Battle of Mabu Mountain ended. The [Japanese] suffered more than 400 casualties. More than 40 of our side died loyally. Battalion Commander Cheng was hit for the sixth time, with a bullet in his left arm. The entire battalion, having completed its mission, was ordered to return to its original defense. Nearby farmers voluntarily participated in carrying the wounded soldiers five li.

Until April 8, the [Japanese] army in the northern section of the Yuehan Railway still did not dare to step out of Guo Town.

(Note) When the army practices shooting, three bullets are fired. A total of thirty-six rings should be hit. Those who can hit twenty-eight rings can be appointed as snipers.

Somewhere near Miluo on April 8, 1939.

### The Anti-Aggression Front Will Expand to the Far East; The British Government Has Agreed to Consider It; Japanese Newspaper Reports That the United States Will Exert Pressure

[Associated Press, London, 19th Urgent Dispatch] Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today in response to a member's inquiry that the British government agrees to consider expanding the anti-aggression front to the Far East.

[Associated Press, London, 18th] It is learned that when Chinese Ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, went to the British Foreign Office to meet with Foreign Secretary Halifax last Tuesday, he mentioned expanding the anti-aggression front to the Far East. At the House of Commons meeting today, Member Henderson asked Chamberlain, "Has the British government ever intended to form a cooperation with China and other Far Eastern countries to resist aggression?" After the meeting, Mr. Henderson told the Associated Press that because one end of the Anti-Communist Axis is far in East Asia, the collective security system must include the East to be effective. He also said, "We do not refuse Japan's participation, nor do we intend to invite Japan to participate, but we are very willing to cooperate with Japan that 'does not aggress'." Diplomatic circles told the Associated Press that if the current talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are regarded as the second stage of carrying out the anti-aggression front, then the future third stage is to expand the anti-aggression front to China and other weak countries in the Far East. Although it is not possible for Britain to make a guarantee to China, the United States ordering its fleet to return to the Pacific is an important step in controlling aggression in the Far East. At the same time, the recent economic assistance to China from various countries and the restrictions on commercial transactions with Japan have made the future of China's resistance war increasingly bright.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] According to the "Asahi Shimbun," US President Roosevelt intends to submit to the Japanese government a personal note similar to the notes recently sent to Hitler and Mussolini. The newspaper also said that Roosevelt may announce that the United States is prepared to convene a conference of countries with interests in the Far East to discuss and resolve the current situation in East Asia.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] The "Asahi Shimbun" here declared today that President Roosevelt's note to Japan is believed to have been delivered to the Japanese government after leaving Yokohama. The Japanese authorities are currently discussing how to respond. First, Japan should refer to the replies from Germany and Italy, believing that the replies reject Roosevelt's proposal. Second, it should adhere to its original position, stating that an international Far East conference is by no means an appropriate and effective way to resolve the situation in the Far East.

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] US Army Major Elliot stated in a speech at the National Defense Conference today that the purpose of the US fleet's concentration in the Pacific is to monitor Japan and prevent Japan from expanding its aggression in Asia during the European crisis.

[Associated Press, London, 18th] The "Standard Evening News" here stated in an article today that the US fleet's concentration in the Pacific is sufficient to replace the British Navy in defending Singapore and Hong Kong. Therefore, it is proper for the British fleet to remain in Europe and not sail to the Far East.

Germany and Italy Will Have Hitler Answer the US Proposal; British Circles Approve of Roosevelt

[Associated Press, Rome, 18th] According to a senior official of the Fascist side here, Mussolini will ignore Roosevelt's proposal and have Hitler answer on his behalf because Mussolini is quite disgusted with the attitude and content of Roosevelt's proposal. The official also said that Hitler has informed Mussolini that he will give a clear answer in the parliament on April 28.

[Reuters, Paris, 18th] Today's newspapers are focusing on Hitler's decision to convene parliament. Paris newspapers' correspondents in Berlin are pessimistic, saying that the reason why the convening of the German parliament was postponed to the 28th of this month is because Hitler wants to resolve the Danzig issue before the parliament convenes. The correspondent in London of this agency did not mention any reason for Hitler's delay in replying to President Roosevelt's telegram (delaying the reply until the German parliament convenes on the 28th of this month). However, British and French observers believe that this is a temporary calm after a long period of tension.

[Reuters, London, 18th] Chamberlain said in the House of Commons, "I would like to take this opportunity to state that the government is very satisfied with President Roosevelt's resolute initiative this time." Those who heard it responded with warm applause.

[Central News Agency, London, 19th] According to a Reuters parliamentary reporter, when Prime Minister Chamberlain mentioned the US President in the House of Commons yesterday, the members cheered loudly, which is sufficient to prove that the members of the House of Commons are deeply satisfied with the US President's telegram to the highest authorities of Germany and Italy. A good impression has been made in all circles of the British Parliament. Although all parties cannot avoid excessive hope about the outcome, the US President's actions are indeed welcomed by all parties.

### The British Prime Minister Declares Increased Production to Prepare for Contingencies; Attaches Importance to the Independence of the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Denmark; The French Premier Announces Increased Security

[Reuters, London, 18th] In the House of Commons today, Prime Minister Chamberlain was asked if he had planned new programs sufficient to increase Britain's ability to fulfill the expanded covenants recently accepted in Europe. Chamberlain replied that the government has proceeded to strengthen and expand the basis of production. The government, in view of the recent changes in the international situation, is always considering that once an accident occurs, all demands will inevitably increase. Therefore, the primary task is to increase production efficiency to increase the supply of military needs in wartime. Regarding the issue of organizing a supply department, the Prime Minister said that he would not make a detailed report. When asked about the negotiations with other countries, the Prime Minister said that there are no special negotiations between the British government and the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Denmark. However, it goes without saying that the independence of these three countries is directly related to the interests of the British Empire. He then replied to the question from the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Attlee, stating that the government should continue to negotiate with all relevant countries, including the Soviet Union. However, temporarily, the situation remains the same as the statement on April 13 and cannot be supplemented.

[Reuters, London, 18th] Conservative Member of Parliament Amery suggested in the House of Commons agenda tonight to immediately accept the principle of compulsory mobilization, that is, the compulsory mobilization of all manpower, financial resources, and military equipment.

[Reuters, London, 18th] The British Secretary of State for War, Hore-Belisha, replied to a question about the Brierly machine gun in the House of Commons today, saying that the production of the gun has greatly increased. He will try to make Canada's manufacturing reach full capacity. It is also planned to establish factories for manufacturing these machine guns in Australia, South Africa, India, and other places. Mr. Hore-Belisha also said that all regular armies in the imperial headquarters and overseas, except for those in India and Burma, are equipped with Brierly machine guns and meet wartime standards.

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] At yesterday's French cabinet meeting, several legal orders were passed, including a new organization for purchasing war materials. During the meeting, Premier Daladier discussed the international situation and solemnly explained the need to increase security to cope with the international situation.

[Central News Agency, London, 19th] The British cabinet will hold a meeting today to discuss various national defense issues. The most important ones are (1) the issue of establishing a supply department, (2) the issue of appointing a minister of the payment department, (3) the issue of conscription, and (4) the issue of compulsory physical training for young people. According to a Reuters reporter, all parties are paying close attention to the conscription system. However, it should not be implemented temporarily.

(Associated Press, Athens, 12th) According to reports from here, Turkey and Greece have decided to cooperate militarily in wartime. The joint land forces will be led by a Turkish general, and the joint naval forces will be commanded by a Greek admiral.

[Central News Agency, The Hague, 18th] In view of the tense situation and the urgent need to strengthen national defense, the government is drafting a bill to extend the term of mandatory military service for the army by two years, the training period for naval soldiers to 21 months, and to increase the number of naval reserve officers.

### Palestine: British Policy Yet to Be Announced

[Reuters, London, 18th] During today's session of the British House of Commons, Colonial Secretary MacDonald, in response to a question from a member of Parliament, stated that in the past month, the restoration of order in Palestine has seen further progress. As a result of the efforts of the police and military, large groups of armed partisans have been dispersed. One important leader has been killed, and another has fled to the Syrian border and surrendered to the French authorities. A large quantity of arms, ammunition, and explosives has been intercepted or surrendered. However, acts of terrorism or sabotage still continue to occur in some isolated areas. The British government is currently unable to announce its future policy. An opposition Labour Party member, Mr. Williams, suggested that in view of the current international situation, any final decision by the government on this matter should be postponed for six months or a year. MacDonald replied that the government has considered this. Subsequently, Mr. Montel inquired about the recent negotiations on the Palestine issue in Cairo, Egypt. MacDonald replied that there were no negotiations there, but this was a separate matter, which he would answer at tomorrow's meeting.

### Hull Denounces Germany for Disrupting World Trade; Barter System a Weapon for Harming Others

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] US Secretary of State Hull issued an important statement last night, denouncing Germany's "barter system" as a weapon for harming others, stating that the system has four drawbacks: (1) disrupting world trade, (2) harming the countries that use the system, (3) reducing world transactions, and (4) lowering the living standards of countries that implement the system. Mr. Hull pointed out that a recent survey by the Department of Commerce showed that the sixteen countries that have concluded trade agreements with the United States have increased their purchases of American goods by 40% in the past three years, while Germany has only increased its purchases by 1.8%.

Brief Commentary

### Heartfelt Matters Written After the Fact: Frontline Victories and Leader's Remarks

Recent events have brought much joy, especially the smooth progress of the counter-offensives on various fronts and the remarks made on the 17th by Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek, reiterating the commitment to unity, perseverance in the war of resistance, and striving for final victory. The former proves that our fighting strength not only still exists, but is also rapidly developing. The latter clearly designates those who "respond to the Kōnoe Statement to annihilate China are seeking surrender and betraying the country." This not only sweeps away the recent poison flames of anti-communism and peace spread by Wang Jingwei and his followers but also clarifies the international situation, allowing the great spirit and sound character of the Chinese nation to shine like the blue sky and white sun in the world!

After this heartening news, we must first enhance our national self-esteem and self-confidence, promote national mobilization with greater enthusiasm, support the hard fighting on all fronts, strengthen the combat effectiveness of the army, and develop production and construction in the rear, in order to achieve the final success of the war of resistance and national reconstruction. At the same time, after the leader's remarks were announced at home and abroad, it became even clearer and undeniable that Wang Jingwei and his followers accepted the intentions of × Party and are advancing their conspiracy of anti-communism, peace, surrender to × and betraying the country. Who are × officials × children, who are deceiving the people × ×, has become even more obvious and undeniable. On the one hand, we still hope that those who are threatened, lured, or intentionally or unintentionally used by Wang ×, etc., will quickly recognize right and wrong, follow the trend, abandon evil and return to righteousness, and start anew. The motherland treats prisoners of war with full kindness, let alone her own children! However, on the other hand, we must not only not tolerate but also be vigilant against the even more vicious and shameless performance of the "anti-communist" and "peace" rhetoric and actions of Wang × × and his followers and the responsible persons for inciting such divisive, unity-destroying, surrender × and betrayal of the country rhetoric, both past and present — although the road to their final failure is already in sight, we will never allow them to be left to their own devices, so as to increase the suffering and sacrifice on our path to war of resistance and national reconstruction! We in the journalistic community should especially lead by example, guide society, assist the government, and thoroughly eliminate traitors and degenerates and their divisive, unity-destroying, surrender × and betrayal of the country rhetoric and actions.

### "Far East International Conference"

Yesterday, the Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun" reported that the US President will present Japan with a similar note to those recently sent to Hitler and Mussolini, and that the US government is preparing to convene a conference of countries with interests in the Far East to discuss and resolve the current situation in East Asia.

What we praise about the US President's peace proposals to Hitler and Mussolini is not the passive demand that Hitler and Mussolini guarantee peace (because past facts have proven that the specialty of fascist aggressors is to break promises and destroy agreements!). What we appreciate about the US President's proposals is their positive significance, namely, that they represent the US government's abandonment of its isolationist policy and active participation in the democratic and peace-loving countries' struggle against fascism and aggression!

Just as it is in Europe, so it is in the Far East. Therefore, even if the US President sends a note to Japan like the one to Hitler and Mussolini, or even prepares to convene an international conference, we cannot harbor any reliance or illusions other than supporting its active significance in assisting China's resistance to aggression. The only condition for resolving disputes in the Far East and realizing peace in East Asia at present is the victory of China's war of resistance. Only by uniting the forces of all democratic and peace-loving countries to assist China in winning victory can there be a genuine guarantee of peace.

### Hong Kong Authorities Meticulously Plan to Protect Water Supply Security in Emergency Situations; Preparing to Use Filtration Methods to Remove Toxins; Surveying Abandoned Household Wells for Firefighting Use

Hong Kong's water supply relies on rainfall for replenishment. In recent years, the population has increased rapidly, and the water stored in various reservoirs is insufficient to meet demand. This situation was exacerbated by the prolonged drought last year, making it particularly severe. Therefore, the relationship between Hong Kong's water reservoirs and other water sources and the drinking water needs of residents is extremely close. If, in an emergency, reservoirs are damaged or poisoned, the situation would be even more severe, and residents would inevitably become like fish trapped in a dry rut. Therefore, the general public is concerned about this. In addition to actively strengthening defense capabilities, the Hong Kong authorities also have meticulous plans for the supply of drinking water in emergency situations. It is reported that the authorities have been carrying out various plans to prepare methods for protecting the safety of drinking water in the event of an air raid. This work has been going on for some time, and all steps have been completed. Except in the case of drought, drinking water can be secured under any severe circumstances. The most difficult problem in wartime drinking water has been how to prevent aggressors from spreading poisonous gas into the reservoirs. The authorities are now preparing to use filtration methods, which can remove toxins from the water. Regarding the safety of Hong Kong's drinking water, in addition to the Hong Kong government having decided on various steps, the military authorities are paying particular attention to this issue and contributing greatly to the protection measures. Among the various plans decided by the Hong Kong government, one is to investigate the number of private wells in Hong Kong. Most of the owners of these old wells have abandoned them. The civil defense authorities have conducted a meticulous survey of these wells, along with other wells still used to draw water. If, in the event of an air raid, the major water mains are temporarily destroyed and unable to supply water as usual, the well water will be extremely useful for the fire department. Although the authorities have clearly surveyed the exact number of these water wells, the time for publication has not yet arrived, but it is believed that there will be thousands of wells or more.

### Refugees in Refugee Camps Repeatedly Subjected to Abuse; Pregnant Refugee Beaten to Death; Another Refugee Suspected of Theft also Beaten to Death; Emergency Committee and Merchants' Relief Committee Write to Authorities to Investigate and Improve

Since the management of refugees in various districts of Hong Kong was taken over by the Hong Kong authorities, incidents of beating and bullying refugees have continued to occur due to poor management. Refugees have been fleeing in recent days, with several cases occurring daily. The Chinese and Western Emergency Refugee Relief Committee, seeing this situation, plans to send a letter to the Hong Kong authorities during the day to report this matter and request that they find ways to improve the situation. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Relief Committee held a standing committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Li Xingqu and Huang Maolin. After discussing various requests for assistance, they also held detailed discussions on the appeal letter from the Kam Tin refugee camp, which described the refugees in the camp being subjected to

all kinds of abuse

and requested improvements in treatment. Huang Maolin, a standing committee member of the Emergency Committee, stood up and stated that regarding the suffering of the refugees in Kam Tin, the Chinese and Western Emergency Relief Committee for Refugees had also received similar appeal letters. They had previously conducted an investigation and held a meeting specifically on this matter. According to the investigation, it was confirmed that a pregnant woman in the camp was beaten severely for brewing medicine in the camp. Later, the pregnant woman, unable to endure such treatment, left the camp on her own. Not long after, the pregnant woman died from her injuries, resulting in the great tragedy of one corpse and two lives. Another day, a refugee was accused of stealing a sack of hemp and was punished by being beaten all over his body. Later, that refugee also

died from his injuries.

The appeal letter to the Emergency Committee stated that the experiences of the refugees in the camp were like those of prisoners in prison. Humans are not wood or stone; how can they endure this? They requested that measures be urgently taken to improve treatment in order to maintain the refugees' livelihood. It was also stated that some Westerners in the camp were arrogant and looked down on everything, treating the refugees like weeds. If improvements are not made urgently, the refugees' lives will be unimaginable in the long run. For this reason, the Emergency Refugee Committee had previously decided at a regular meeting to send a letter to Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Sze-tu Wing-kok, asking him to pay attention to this appeal and make improvements. Therefore, it was resolved to send a letter to Dr. Sze-tu Wing-kok, asking him to investigate the circumstances of this matter and stating that even if brewing medicine in the camp violated camp rules, it should not be punished by beating. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.

### Speech by the Chairman of the Hong Kong League of Nations Association: The International Crisis and the League of Nations; Britain's Failure to Impose Sanctions on Japan Led to the Rampant Aggression of Invaders; The League of Nations' Position is Precarious and Collective Security Should be Promoted.

The Hong Kong League of Nations Association held its annual meeting yesterday afternoon. The newly appointed chairman, Xia Sha, gave a speech, providing a detailed review of the current deteriorating international situation and attributing it to Britain's failure to resolutely participate in economic sanctions against Japan at the time of the September 18th Incident, which led to the decline of the League of Nations' authority and the disregard of the sanctity of treaties by aggressor nations. The discussion was quite insightful.

Global Condemnation: Hitler's Rampage

Mr. Bu stated that in the history of the world, there has never been a time as fraught with crises and anxiety as today. Not only is this the case every year and every month, but every day and every hour there is the possibility of change. He does not firmly believe that war is inevitable, but a look at recent events makes it impossible for anyone to deny that such a possibility exists, and looking to the future, no one is without anxiety. Mr. Bu continued, saying that Hitler, in his speech to the Reichstag on May 17, 1933, stated that "Germans have no intention of invading any country." Now, six years later, Hitler's actions have proven that he does not care what he says. When Germany occupied Moravia and Bohemia, its actions were severely condemned by political leaders around the world.

Britain's Failure to Sanction Japan: Greater Losses

Regarding the issue of the League of Nations, Mr. Bu pointed out that the invasion and occupation of "Manchuria" had a terrible impact, not only undermining the League of Nations' credibility but also affecting the concept of all nations respecting the sanctity of treaties. If Britain had participated in sanctions at that time (and had obtained the cooperation of the United States), Britain would have suffered considerable economic losses, but according to his estimation, the highest would have been no more than £20 million. The magnitude of the losses from the decline of the League of Nations today is incalculable. Because Britain was unwilling to sacrifice at the time, it is now suffering significant commercial losses. The sacrifice at that time would have been a constructive sacrifice, while today's sacrifice is a sacrifice with no compensation.

China's Resistance: Demonstrating Strength

Today, although the League of Nations and those who love peace are in a difficult situation, the hope for peace has not been completely extinguished. China's resistance to aggression and nationalism is obvious to all. It can be asserted that whatever actions the United States takes, they will provide moral assistance to the international order. Britain's foreign policy two weeks ago clearly indicated a renewed trend towards a collective security system. This move is the fundamental measure of the League of Nations. If it succeeds, it will increase the courage of small countries and create a League of Nations that conforms to its original ideals.

### Twenty Refugee Children Poisoned During Breakfast; Hospital Treatment Shows No Problems; Two Still Hospitalized

In the former National Hospital refugee camp, twenty refugee children, fourteen boys and six girls, suddenly felt unwell after breakfast yesterday. People in the camp knew it was poisoning and sent them by car to Queen Mary Hospital. After being diagnosed and treated by doctors, eighteen people were fine and safely discharged, but two boys were more severely poisoned and remained hospitalized for treatment.

### Strengthening National Salvation Power; Women's Solidarity Completed; Unified Organizational Charter Fully Adopted Yesterday; Named the Hong Kong Chinese Women's Federation

The preparatory committee of the Hong Kong Women's Federation held its first preparatory meeting yesterday at the Women's Welfare Association. Representatives from various groups attended, including Liu Qingxuan, Wu Yanzhuang, Wang Xiaoying, Su Anping, Xi Xiuying, Shan Dexin, and Deng Xiaosu. After revising the unified organizational charter, it was adopted and formally named the "Hong Kong Chinese Women's Federation." It was also determined that all women's organizations with more than one hundred members in this area should participate regularly. All the representatives present that evening expressed their willingness to unite their will and take uniform steps under the banner of this organization to make the greatest contribution to the War of Resistance and national construction. The atmosphere at the meeting was exceptionally harmonious, and all matters discussed were extremely clear and decisive.

### Guangdong Drama Association; Record of the Establishment of the First Troupe; A Ceremony Full of New Life

— Cicada Song

Feature

The Guangzhou drama workers with a fighting revolutionary tradition, after losing their old home, persevered and struggled to disperse and work everywhere, mobilizing the vast masses and serving the army, and exerting the highest degree of power.

Recently, many people have successively arrived in Hong Kong after repeated transfers. They still use this hard-fighting working ability to launch the Hong Kong War of Resistance drama movement on the drama front. The Hong Kong Association of Guangdong Drama Association members, this organization appeared on the Hong Kong drama scene not long ago with a brand new and strong attitude, giving people a good impression in its work performance.

In order to strengthen its own work in an organized manner, and to more actively promote the Hong Kong drama movement, they decided to implement the plan that the Guangdong Drama Association had decided on in Guangzhou in the past but had not been able to realize, and recently began to prepare for the creation of the Guangdong Drama Association First Troupe; after many weeks of careful preparation, the formal establishment ceremony was finally held yesterday!

Whether standing on the concentrated power of the motherland's war of resistance and unity, or standing on the Hong Kong drama movement, the birth of the First Troupe is worthy of our congratulations.

Yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 p.m., they borrowed the Chinese Children's College as the venue for their establishment ceremony, simply and solemnly arranged, and sixty to seventy people attended, which was lively and happy. Representatives of social groups included the China Arts Troupe, China Touring Troupe, China National Salvation Troupe, Red and White Troupe, China Amateur Troupe, Lufeng Drama Society, Youth Tong Lok Society, Youth Troupe, Ant Troupe, Pioneer Children's Troupe, Whirlwind Drama Society, etc.; individuals included Ouyang Yuqian, Jinshan, Bu Wei, Lin Cang, Lu Fu, Li Hua, Tang Xingtu... and other gentlemen.

The most eye-catching thing was that the troupe members or directors had fresh red flowers inserted in their lapels. This new logo made people strongly feel that the establishment of their troupe was using bloody struggle, a brilliant future, and a new atmosphere!

After the ceremony was performed, Zhong Qinan of the troupe delivered the opening speech, briefly stating that the drama work in Guangzhou has an eternal fighting spirit. No matter when and where, they use strong working ability to expand and strive for new working fields. The establishment of the First Troupe this time is also organized under this spirit. It is hoped that in the future, it will be more organized and more powerful to establish new work! …

Then, Hu Chunbing reported on the preparation of the troupe up to its establishment, detailing the past work of the Guangdong Drama Association and the dispersal of comrades in various places after the fall of Guangzhou, working hard in their respective positions, and the birth of the First Troupe is to more actively and organizedly participate in the motherland's war of resistance and national salvation drama movement. Although it is now established in Hong Kong, it can only be said that Hong Kong is the starting point of this troupe, and it is hoped that it will return to the motherland in the future. At the same time, it is hoped that when in Hong Kong, it will strive to establish more progressive drama work for the Hong Kong drama movement.

After that, representatives from China Arts, China Touring, Red and White, and many other social groups gave speeches, all warmly wishing that this newborn and energetic group can grow healthily, join hands on the unified front of the drama movement, and strive for the final victory of the nation with the most powerful function!

Everyone who participated in the meeting was so excited and enthusiastically revealed on the menu, casually using snacks, listening to the speeches, and praying for a newborn phoenix to start flying in the new environment!

The directors of the troupe, such as Chuan Buwei, Huang Guoqin, and Lin Cang, all gave very beautiful congratulatory speeches under the enthusiastic request of the crowd, and thus completed this very meaningful ceremony in a more excited and joyful atmosphere.

The birth of the First Troupe of the Guangdong Drama Association is undoubtedly a brand new and good performance on the Hong Kong drama scene. They have a very neat cast in their lineup, and they all have deep and long-lasting drama work experience. This rich experience will naturally have a good impact on their future work performance.

The organization and candidates of the troupe have been decided. The head of the troupe is Hu Chunbing, the director of general affairs is Huo Er. The director of drama affairs is Zhong Qinan, the director of organization is Huang Ninglin, the director of publicity is Zhan Ming, the director of organization is Tang Shuming, the director of secretaries is Zhu Baishui, and the assistants are Li Shulun, Ling Ke, and Ruihua, etc., and Mr. He Xiangning, Huang Guoqin, Cheng Shewo, Jian Youwen, Lin Cang, Fu Buwei, and Tang Xingtu serve as the directors of the troupe, so the strength is very strong.

It is said that the troupe will immediately start work after its establishment. The first play to be performed is "Chinese Man" by Hu Chunbing, followed by Xia Yan's "Sai Jinhua, " "A Year, " "Under the Shanghai Stars," and other famous plays.

For the birth of the First Troupe of the Guangdong Drama Association, we warmly extend our sincere congratulations and bright hopes!

### Manufacturers Association Meeting; Discussing Setting Up Factories in Macau; Some Manufacturers Agree with the Move and Hope Macau Will Slightly Reduce Electricity and Water Fees

### Eastern Front Victory Report: Our Troops Reclaim Shilong; Enemy Desperately Struggling Retreats to Eastern Suburbs, Resisting Stubbornly; Fierce Battle at Shetou Ridge, Enemy Attempts to Counterattack Zengcheng; Our Troops Confront Enemy at Wancheng; Harassment and Raids Near Nantou Repelled

[Special Dispatch from Shenzhen] According to reports from the Eastern Front, our army's counteroffensive in Dongguan is progressing rapidly. Yesterday, the 17th, our troops fiercely attacked Shilong, utterly defeating the enemy and reclaiming it once again. Currently, they are continuing to encircle and attack Dongguan City, sweeping away the remaining enemy forces, with the momentum to take it in one fell swoop. The details of yesterday's battle are recorded below:

Recapture of Shilong; Fierce Battle in the Eastern Suburbs

The Wu Kangjian unit of the X Regiment of the Twelfth Army Corps, after reclaiming Zengcheng, immediately pressed towards the enemy forces between Dongguan and Shilong, advancing steadily. For days, taking advantage of the dense fog and intermittent spring rain, they coordinated with the X District Guerrilla Force, launching attacks on Shilong Town yesterday, engaging the enemy in fierce battles, followed by hand-to-hand combat. The enemy used small mortars to bombard our troops, but to no effect. Because our attack on Shilong Town was coordinated with the guerrillas, advancing from Jingshan, Xihu, and other places on one front, and another route attacking along the railway from Nanshe, although the enemy tried hard to resist, our morale was high and brave, annihilating over a hundred enemy soldiers, and finally driving the enemy out of the eastern suburbs of Shilong. Shilong Town was thus recaptured by our side. However, enemy reinforcements arrived, continuing to encamp near the eastern suburbs. Our troops then engaged in another bloody battle, which was extremely fierce. Both sides suffered casualties. Currently, they are still in a standoff outside the eastern gate.

Ten Li from Wancheng; Our Troops Confront Each Other. After our troops took Shilong yesterday, they immediately dispatched a part to attack Wancheng, and immediately notified the Liaobu Wintang defense troops to cooperate with the guerrilla team to attack the enemy in the Wancheng area. Contact was made with the enemy outposts. The enemy troops in Wancheng, due to dealing with our team's attacks for days, were exhausted. This time, they were suddenly ambushed and responded in a panic. Furthermore, they were attacked by our two-way pincer attack and were even more flustered. Many enemy soldiers were killed in this battle. At the critical moment of life and death, the enemy was fortunate to have reinforcements arrive, enabling them to resist. Currently, our troops are still in a standoff about ten li from Wancheng.

Near Nantou; Enemy Boats Harass

The area within Bao'an County is extremely peaceful. Enemy planes occasionally come to scout. As for the Nantou area, after our recovery of it, the county authorities immediately sent personnel to preside over all military, political, and security matters in the area. In recent days, enemy warships anchored near Chiwei have sent several rubber boats near Nantou on the 15th and 16th to harass and probe our rear military situation, due to our army's counterattack on the eastern route and repeated victories. When the enemy came to attack, our local teams immediately gave them a painful blow. On the evening of the 18th, the enemy again harassed and attacked, but our surveillance was strict, and the enemy retreated without success, it is said.

Enemy Attacks Shetou; Bloody Battle Unfolds

The enemy in Shitan, pressed by our troops advancing along the Zengtan Highway and the north and south of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, in order to break the deadlock and save the dying, in addition to greatly reinforcing Shilong on one side to maintain the previous line, launched a counterattack on Zengcheng on the other side to block our troops' flanking attack. On the 17th, they launched a fierce attack on Shetou Ridge southwest of Zengcheng, attempting to counterattack Zengcheng. According to intelligence forwarded from the front, on the evening of the 17th, continuous night rain and dark skies provided an opportunity for our troops, cooperating with the local guerrilla teams and local armed civilians, to take advantage of the rain to launch a night attack on the enemy. When they arrived at the destination, they suddenly attacked the enemy positions with the most fierce posture. The enemy also stubbornly resisted from their fortifications, and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with hand grenades and bayonets. Both sides were evenly matched, and the bloody battle lasted all night until 10:00 a.m. on the 18th. However, our soldiers fought bravely, annihilating hundreds of enemy soldiers. There were quite a few enemy corpses. Our army also suffered considerable casualties. It has been verified that the enemy's attempt to break through our Shetou Ridge position this time in order to counterattack Zengcheng was quite fierce. Our army has a thorough defense plan, and the enemy will not succeed, it is said.

### Keshan Team Recovers Tanzhou; Anti-Japanese Sentiment Extremely Strong; Situation in Zhongshan County Remains Stable

[Special Dispatch from Shiqi] The war clouds in Zhongshan became even more tense after the fall of Tanzhou at 5:00 p.m. on the 14th. However, our team's garrison did not waver due to this minor setback. After adjusting the various units on the 16th, they immediately began a counterattack and successfully recovered Tanzhou at X p.m. on the 17th.

Progress of the Battle

At noon on the 14th, 300 enemy soldiers landed on Luosha on the side of Tanzhou in several speedboats. Our garrison, with limited strength, retreated to a new defense after exacting a considerable price. Yuan Xianglin's Ninth District Volunteer Team joined the battle, preventing the enemy from realizing their attempt to invade Da Huangpu and attack Xiaolan. The enemy then tried to induce our people in Tanzhou to organize a puppet maintenance society, but failed to do so.

Recapture of Tanzhou

The first special team commander, Yuan Dai, in order to foil the enemy's conspiracy and stabilize Zhongshan, specifically ordered Qu Renzhe to lead the troops to reinforce, and together with Li Weizhen's unit, planned a counterattack. After all the deployments were completed, they launched attacks on the enemy in several ways on the morning of the 17th, killing more than 200 enemy soldiers. The battle was fierce. The enemy's strength in that area was about five or six hundred, and there were two enemy warships on the sea, constantly shelling. Our army and our soldiers bravely and fearlessly went forward, not diminishing their vigor due to the threat of enemy fire. The enemy, with scattered troops, suffered more than 50 casualties and was unable to hold on, and began to collapse and retreat to board the boats and flee at X:30 p.m. Our army took advantage of the victory to launch a surprise attack and recovered Tanzhou at X o'clock. Tanzhou has become more deserted after being lost twice, with a desolate scene everywhere.

Zhongshan Stable

After the fall of Tanzhou, there were rumors that the situation in Da'ao and Xiaolan was critical, and it was also rumored that enemy soldiers had tried to land. According to Deputy Commander Zhou Shouyu, the brave deeds are indeed inaccurate. The current Zhongshan County is quite peaceful, and the people's anti-Japanese sentiment is high. Especially in the Second District, the anti-Japanese will is extremely strong. The local people have a large armed force, so when the enemy landed offshore, they did not dare to cross the river and invade.

### Enemy Attempts to Counterattack Zengcheng; We Achieve Complete Victory in Paitan; Bloody Battle for Two Days and Nights Ends in Enemy Defeat; We Achieve Significant Gains in the Battle of Jiangcun

[Special Dispatch from the North River] In the general counteroffensive of our army in Guangdong Province, Zengcheng was recovered on the 15th on the eastern route, and the encirclement of Guangzhou was completed with the Northwest Route Army. The enemy planned to defend Guangzhou to the death, and urgently transferred the main force to concentrate on the Zengcong line to counterattack us, hoping to make a final struggle and engage in a decisive battle with us. On the 16th, the enemy army in Conghua launched a full-scale attack on Paitan. The enemy's offensive was frantic, and our garrison immediately fought back bravely, launching an unprecedented fierce battle. Our troops fought a bloody battle near Paitan for two days and nights, and completely defeated all the invading enemy forces by the 18th. The military situation is recorded below:

Struggle for Paitan; We Achieve Complete Victory

It has been verified that Paitan is an important stronghold in northern Zengcheng, forming a strategic point with Fuhe. The enemy controlling Zengcong, in order to retake Zengcheng to protect Guangzhou, did not hesitate to make major sacrifices, so they urgently attacked Paitan. On the 16th, six or seven thousand enemy soldiers from Conghua, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, attacked from the Shengang Taipingchang in several ways, attempting to flank Zengcheng and attack our army's rear, adopting a large detour strategy. They occupied Jiekou along the Guangcong Highway from Shengang, bypassed Dazhegu Ridge, obliquely exited Jilonggang, and infiltrated Shi Kang, the border between Zengcheng Longmen and Conghua, and then went straight to Paitan from Guancun Dongdong. On the evening of the 16th and the morning of the 17th, our troops fought fiercely in the vicinity of Paitan. The Twelfth Army Corps, Huang Tao Liang Shiji Lin Weichou and other divisions, and Wen Shuhai Brigade, all returned to attack the enemy in a pincer attack. The enemy came fiercely, and the bloody battle lasted all day, repeatedly advancing and retreating, and the struggle was fierce. On the 17th, the enemy who detoured from Conghua was completely defeated, and then the enemy army in front of the Paitan front was surrounded and annihilated. Our soldiers fought bravely, one after another, and until the early morning of the 18th, the enemy's momentum was frustrated, and they retreated in a panic. As a result of the fierce struggle in this battle, more than 700 enemy soldiers were killed, more than ten enemy soldiers were captured, more than 100 long and short guns were captured, and countless military supplies were captured. Enemy corpses were everywhere, and they have now collapsed and become disorganized. We are now pursuing the victory and are chasing.

Ye Zhao Leads Troops; Fiercely Attacks Shengang

Ye Zhao, Deputy Commander of the Twelfth Army Corps, was ordered by the Supreme Military Authority of South China to command the Northeast and Northwest Route armies to approach Guangzhou directly. Yesterday, he personally went to the front to supervise the battle. It was found that the main force of the enemy in the northern route was concentrated in Shengang Taipingchang under Conghua's jurisdiction, and it was urgently appropriate to take advantage of the opportunity to attack Paitan in one fell swoop and cut off their retreat. At dusk on the 17th, he personally led a large army from a certain unit to pounce on the side of Shengang from the southwest of Conghua. That night, all our troops had arrived in the area of the west bank of Shengang. A certain mechanized elite of our army displayed its power and bombarded the enemy with dense artillery fire. It was found that there were more than 3,000 enemy soldiers in Shengang. At that time, because a part detoured Jiekou and Shi Kang to attack Paitan, they were defeated by us and lost their fighting spirit. Our army was extremely brave, crossed the Yangcun River and forced into the enemy's position. The enemy stubbornly resisted with fortifications, and the situation was unsustainable. At midnight, the enemy in Taipingchang heard the news and rushed to reinforce in a large team, and the battle became more intense. Our army bravely charged and killed many enemy soldiers. By dawn, due to strategic relations, we automatically retreated to the original position.

Attacking Jiangcun; Decapitating Dozens of Enemy Soldiers

It was also found that after our army once again recovered Xin Jie Hengtan, it immediately deployed a strong position to prevent the enemy from trying to take it back with all their strength. On the one hand, we pursued the enemy and cleared out the remaining enemy forces. On the 16th and 17th, our troops fought fiercely in Xin Cun, Miaotan, Changgang, and the Longxiang Longkou Village area on the Guanghua Road, annihilating many enemy soldiers. The enemy who is currently trapped in Longkou Village still has more than a thousand people, making a last-ditch struggle. Our army is encircling and annihilating them. Also, after recovering Xin Jie, our army on the railway front immediately continued to advance and guarded the Guotang Shilongxu area, controlling the enemy in Jiangcun. On the morning of the 17th, a certain attacking force suddenly attacked the enemy in Jiangcun. Our morale was unstoppable, and we went straight to the enemy camp. The enemy responded in a panic and was decapitated by us dozens of people. The remaining enemy was terrified and retreated into the market to stubbornly defend. Our army, with the mission accomplished, retreated to the villages along the railway north of Jiangcun and closely monitored the enemy, it is said.

### Our Grand Encirclement Takes Shape; Enemy in Guangzhou Panics; Enemy Warships Gather in the Pearl River; Seemingly Preparing for a Retreat

[Special Dispatch from Shameen] The counteroffensive military affairs of the East, West, and North Routes are victorious at every turn, repeatedly capturing key points, and approaching Guangzhou directly. Gunfire has been heard in the suburbs of the city. Plainclothes teams are active and expansive. The enemy army is in great panic. The situation in Guangzhou has suddenly fallen into a state of terror. The various situations have been briefly recorded in the newspaper. The latest movements of the enemy army, as well as various situations, are recorded in detail below:

Enemy Warships Gather in the Pearl River

Since the enemy occupied Guangzhou, there have been many enemy shallow-water warships and enemy country merchant ships parked in the Pearl River, or coming and going, transporting military equipment and inferior goods. After our army began the counteroffensive, the Northeast Route progressed Guangzhou by segments. The enemy army in the city panicked, and suddenly discovered a large number of enemy warships and armed fishing boats on the 12th and 13th, which sailed in from Humen overseas and were docked in the river surface from Huangpu to Baishi Shell Zhou Tou Tsui White Goose Pond, densely packed like a comb. Statistics show that there are no less than two hundred ships of various sizes, parked day and night, unable to move. Judging from their dynamics, they are preparing for the time when they cannot defend Guangzhou to the death, and the remnants will be able to escape along the waterway. All enemy army warships and ships are camouflaged in gray to confuse our air force's bombing targets.

Construction of Enemy Troops in the City Stalled

The commander of the invading enemy, in order to restore the prosperity of the city and expand economic aggression, started the construction of the textile factory, cement factory, beverage factory, and paper factory in Shi Chungou, Henan two months ago, and transported a large number of parts to install and prepare to resume work in the above-mentioned major factories to manufacture inferior goods. The disaster sites on Yonghan Road and Hui'ai Road in the city have also been cleared, and it is planned to open inferior goods stores. Huangpu Merchants are actively recruiting workers, but since listening to our counterattack, the above-mentioned constructions have been suspended, and the hard-working citizens who were detained for service have been driven to the suburbs to load, unload, and carry military supplies.

Japanese Women and Inferior Goods Retreat One After Another

When our army retreated not long ago, the enemy army boasted to its people how to restore prosperity and strengthen construction, and welcomed Japanese people to come and visit, and organized strict consolation groups to come to the South. At the same time, a large number of inferior goods and various raw materials were transported to invade the economy of our people. Now that our army's counterattack is as urgent as starlight, panic has begun. Therefore, Japanese women and inferior goods have been retreating since the 10th of this month. The state of Japanese women in major hotels in Xihakou has disappeared, and the situation in the city is also showing signs of depression.

And in all counties in Guangdong, self-defense groups and guerrilla teams have been organized separately to launch a wide range of strategic strikes. Although the eastern border of Guangdong has not yet experienced war, the situation in Chaoshan has recently been fluctuating and unstable. The enemy's ambition to covet the eastern region is fierce. In order to seek precautions and strengthen the power of self-defense and king, it is necessary to assist the regular army in combat when necessary. It is necessary to mobilize the armed people on the Guangdong border to form guerrilla columns, and to recruit heroes from all walks of life in the counties, and allow them to rehabilitate themselves, and concentrate on the anti-Japanese war front and serve the country. It is now being planned separately. Recently, Chen Kan, deputy division commander of the No. X division, was sent to Xingning, Longchuan, Meixian, Jiaoling, Pingyuan and other counties to contact the county chiefs and local gentry and elders to handle everything to facilitate the formation.

### Sonya Henie Changes Her Style; Wants to Become a Formal Actress; Now Preparing Suitable Script

The business eyes of American film merchants are omnipresent. Many famous athletes, such as swimmers and boxers, have been recruited, and the most recent one is Sonya Henie. Sonya is proficient in skating, more pure, enthusiastic, and beautiful than other female skaters, which attracted Hollywood's attention, and film merchants began to discuss, saying that there is such a girl, whose skating skills are superb and famous, and thousands of people are eager to see her performance on the ice. Originally, ordinary sports films would be enough to make a five- or six-minute newsreel, but for Sonya, it is different, and she can be hired to make feature films. So it was decided to hire her.

Although Sonya has no experience in acting, the business eyes of the film merchants are not on her acting skills, but only on her skating skills. Therefore, after Sonya received limited acting guidance, she began to film; of course, the focus was on her skating skills, which were indeed beautiful in posture and proficient in movements; coupled with the use of photography techniques, it seemed that it could stir up the audience. So she shot one after another, "One in a Million," "Happy Landing," etc., for a total of four films. None of them have deviated from "dance", but her limited acting skills have not improved. The audience sees this set again and again, with the same girl performing the same few skating techniques, which inevitably makes them lose interest.

The producer Shan Nick, who hired Sonya, also felt the audience's intention, knowing that if this continues, she will inevitably fall into the same fate as many sports stars who failed to call after appearing on the screen for a short time, so he tried to turn her from a skater into an actress. However, this problem is not easy to solve, because Sonya's acting skills and experience are relatively shallow. Now, experienced playwrights are preparing scripts suitable for her performance. On the one hand, Sonya is also working hard to learn the acting skills that an actress should have. Of course, Sonya's new play will not be completely without her skating performance, but skating has been put in a secondary position, only performing a few scenes occasionally, mainly using acting skills to win the audience's sympathy.

Sonya will perform in a new posture in the new film. It is generally believed that she will work hard and will still be able to have a long-term film star career, and will not disappear like other sports stars.

He turned back and pulled out a book, reading aloud, Eileen listened, but, she didn't listen to a single point, she just listened to his voice, and her eyes were fixed on his face.

### Basketball Results

Division Two

Chun Fung Defeats Red Star, International Crushes Kwong Chung

In the Open Men's Basketball Tournament, only two Division Two matches were held last night. In the first match, Chun Fung played against Red Star. Chun Fung's offense was often quick, and Red Star was suppressed. They willingly went downhill, resulting in a one-sided game. In Chun Fung's lineup, Chen Shufen had excellent plays, Li Jiali was active, and Yu Maohuai and Xu Zhouxing were also good on both offense and defense. Winning was the expected result due to their stronger strength. In the Red Star team, Shao Junhua had some good plays, and Lü Rulin and Chen Peiji also performed well, but their skills and coordination were not as good as their opponents, so they had to lose. The final result was 58 to 27, with Chun Fung winning.

In the second match, Kwong Chung played against International. The two sides fought fiercely, and the situation was worth watching. International's players were evenly matched. Li Fuqi and Chen Yongfa were exceptionally agile, attacking from both long and short ranges, which was very appropriate. Li Bonian and Guo En also made many achievements by sneaking under the basket. However, Kwong Chung tried their best to counterattack, and each player often had good plays, but their strength was ultimately not as good as their opponents, so they lost. After the start of the game, International showed its sharpness. Li Fuqi and Chen Yongfa attacked several times, one after another, taking the lead. Kwong Chung was not willing to show weakness. The whole army cheered up and moved forward. Xie Di's long shot actually went in, and Jin Bao and Feng Zhihong also scored one after another, so it became a mixed battle. The scores increased and decreased each other, which was very tense. At the end of the first half, the two sides tied at 21 to 21. Changing sides and fighting again, International added fresh troops, and their prestige greatly increased. Chen Yongfa, Li Bonian, and Guo En attacked from three directions at the same time, unstoppable, causing Kwong Chung to be in a state of chaos. Under pressure, they suddenly saw Jin Baibo, Feng Tan Hong, Xie Di, and others break through and counterattack, and they also staged a tense situation of reciprocal action. They once held on at 35 to 35. Afterwards, the International army worked harder and the situation improved. Several fierce attacks were all successful. At this point, Kwong Chung's position was shaken, and the general trend was gone, and it was irreversible. At the end of the game, Kwong Chung lost to International with a score of 37 to 46.

### Baseball Association Recruits Talents, Hong Kong Club Recruits Talents, Softball Finals This Weekend

(Our Special Dispatch) The Open Baseball Tournament will come into being, and the competition will begin on the 6th of next month. There are a total of six teams that have registered to participate.

The Hong Kong Baseball Club held a meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the issue of selecting players to participate in the competition and decided to find ways to recruit talents and form a strong and powerful team to compete with other teams.

In addition, the International Softball Tournament has reached the final stage. The men's group has the Chinese and Portuguese teams winning the finals, and the women's group has the Chinese and Philippine teams winning the finals. The championship battle was originally scheduled to be held at the Kowloon venue last weekend, but it was postponed due to rain that day. It has now been rescheduled to be held this Sunday at the Kowloon venue.

### Today's Tennis Doubles Semifinals: Xu Family Team Faces Lin Huang, Yesterday's Doubles Postponed Due to Rain

[Our News] Due to continuous rain, the Open Grass Tennis Tournament has repeatedly missed the best time. Yesterday's doubles semifinal between Xiang Jialiu and Li Rurong against the Lin Zhen brothers was originally a good show and attracted much attention, but it could not be held due to continuous spring rain all day.

After more than a month of fierce battles, the weak were eliminated and the strong were retained, and it has reached a serious juncture. However, the recent battles have been blocked by rain, and the end must be delayed. It is believed that the final can be held at the earliest in another week.

If it is sunny today, there will be another doubles semifinal held between Xu Weipei and Xu Runpei against Lin Tiande and Huang Jinxi. It will start at 4:30 PM at the Hong Kong Cricket Club venue. The Xu family team is the champion of the past two sessions. Everyone knows how good their skills are. Lin Zhen brothers, who have been in the tennis world for eight sessions, have also been no match for the Xu family team in the past two years.

Lin Huang are also good players, and being able to reach the semifinals is certainly not a fluke. However, they are still new to the experience, not as well-coordinated as the Xu family team. Moreover, Mr. Lin has not fully recovered from his illness, and his physical strength has not fully recovered. Fighting against a strong enemy today is expected to be more ominous than auspicious. (Calling for wind).

鍾勇森 Zhang Jinahai Came to Hong Kong from Hanoi, Failed to Accompany Eastern on the Expedition

[Our Special Dispatch] Zhong Yongsen and Zhang Jinhai, the strong players who went to Hanoi from Điện Biên Phủ, wanting to accompany the Eastern Football Team on their southern expedition, arrived late in Hanoi. Eastern had already left for Hue and transferred to Ben Thuy, so the two did not make it in time to join the army and were forced to take a boat to Hong Kong, arriving the day before yesterday. It is said that the two will stay in Hong Kong for quite some time.

According to a telegram from Eastern the day before yesterday, Zhang Jinhai was injured in the battle against the Cochinchina B team. It is thought that Zhang Jinhai is Jin's pseudonym, not the Zhang Jinhai who arrived in Hong Kong before (Calling for rain).

### Division Two Football League Runner-Up: Still Not Resolved, Yesterday the Kowloon Club Did Not Lend the Stadium for Use, Rescheduled to This Saturday and Sunday

[Our Special Dispatch] The entire order of the Division Two Football League has already been completed. The champion was won by Kai Wah. However, Middlesex and the 5th Garrison Artillery have each played 22 games and happened to get 37 points each, sharing the second place in the table. A final match must be held to determine who is the runner-up.

This important final match was originally scheduled to be held the week before, but the Artillery said that they had not received a notice from the Association that day and did not know about it, so they did not send a team to play, causing the runner-up position to be unresolved.

In order to expedite the conclusion, the Association re-scheduled the decisive battle for 4:00 PM yesterday at the Kowloon venue. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, the Association received a telegram from the Kowloon Club, saying that the club had completed the competition and the site management and maintenance work had also ended, and the site was no longer open and could not be borrowed for use. Based on this, the Association immediately notified Middlesex and the Artillery separately, rescheduling it to this Saturday and Sunday, but the location has not yet been determined (Eastern Son).

### Impressions of the Hong Kong Brewery

Our Special Feature

Yesterday, Mr. Ruttonjee, the owner of the Hong Kong Brewery, invited reporters from Hong Kong to visit, and the new stimulus stirred up some ordinary thoughts.

The guide was Mr. Luo Gongrong, the Chinese sales director of the company. Two cars crossed mountains and ridges and finally visited this only brewery in Hong Kong - and it can be safely said, the only one in the Far East - in the Shenjing area of Qingshan Road, Tsuen Wan. Backed by mountains and facing the sea, the scenery is magnificent. Covering an area of 620,000 square feet, the building is grand and the chimney is towering. The beer that people drink is produced by the laborers here.

The owner, Mr. Ruttonjee, is a typical Jewish man who is rich and good at business. His hospitality to guests is touching.

The raw materials of beer are malt and hop flowers, and the malt comes from Germany. The method of brewing beer is probably to put the ground malt and hop flowers into a boiling furnace, and when it reaches a certain degree, extract the juice to ferment it. After the fermentation process, it is then transferred to a brewing tank for preparation, and then filled into wine bottles, etc. After the machine room subjects it to a certain temperature, it is transferred to the cold storage room, and it can be sold after four months.

The malt opener, the malt crushing machine, the boiling furnace fermentation department freezer (with twelve large fermenting tanks), the brewing freezer (with more than thirty large brewing tanks), the laboratory, the washing room, the wine filling, labeling, ice making room, and generator - all parts have been visited! Science is really omnipotent! Labor is sacred!

The workers here are all Chinese workers: there are 40 female workers, and their monthly wages range from 13 to 15 yuan. There are more than 60 male workers, and their monthly wages range from 13 to 19 yuan. They have to pay for their own meals, but the factory provides accommodation, work clothes, and all supplies. It is said that the factory treats its workers much better than other factories. The workers arrive at the factory at 7:00 AM every day and take a "shower" in the bathroom before starting work. There is also a hospital to treat patients, which attaches great importance to health and hygiene, because this is an important condition for increasing production. At 5:00 PM, the male and female workers return to their comfortable dormitories, where they can listen to the radio and play the erhu. It is said that this is a rare life among workers.

The land and machinery of the entire factory are valued at 1.5 million yuan. There are also many surrounding mountains that are also Mr. Ruttonjee's own property. The capital of the entire brewery is about several million yuan or more. It is Mr. Ruttonjee's sole investment.

The factory produces about 300 boxes of beer a day, with 48 bottles of wine in each box, for a total of about 15,000 bottles. Each box sells for 21 yuan and 5 jiao in Hong Kong dollars. It can sell more than 6,000 yuan a day. Each gallon of wine should pay a tax of 7 jiao. The weekly tax payment is about 4,000 yuan. It has been more than five years since the factory was founded. After Japanese wine was boycotted in Hong Kong, the factory's sales gradually developed.

The factory has an ice factory attached to it, producing about 18 tons of ice a day. In addition to a portion for its own use, most of it is sold in Hong Kong. The owner also built a private residence facing the sea on the top of the mountain, which is very magnificent and exquisite.

I spent half a day visiting another world. On the way back, in my mind, the production methods of capitalist society and the ideological trends of socialist society were like waves in the ocean, stirring up and down.

### Changes in Shanghai Industry and Commerce

— Hui

[Shanghai Correspondence] In February, there were a total of 373 changes in Shanghai's industry and commerce, with the most being new openings, totaling 201, followed by transfers, 108, share transfers, 47, closures, 12, restarts, 3, and expansion and name changes, 1 each. Among the 201 new openings, there were only two factories and 199 commercial firms. Compared to the 36 new openings in January, there was an increase of 165. There is a reason why it suddenly increased compared to the previous month, which is that the newly opened Baile Shopping Mall and Luzon Road Temple Market in Jing'an Temple, West Shanghai, had 44 industrial and commercial factories and firms participating in the former, and 124 in the latter. Therefore, the number of new openings was about five times more than the previous month. If these two shopping malls did not participate in the number of industrial and commercial factories and firms, then there would be only 33, which would be less than the previous month. Among these 201 newly opened industrial and commercial factories and firms, classified by industry, the most were daily necessities, with 67, followed by the catering industry, with 43, the clothing industry, with 24, the cultural industry, with 20, the decoration industry, with 13, the pharmaceutical industry, with 9, the entertainment industry, with 7, and the last being the civil engineering industry, with 1. In February, in addition to the opening of the two shopping malls, there is also something worth mentioning, which is the completion of three large-scale cinemas. This is because Shanghai has become the so-called "isolated island" and is showing abnormal development. The rise of the entertainment industry can also be said to be an inevitable trend under the abnormal reality.

In February, there were three restarts, a decrease of 11 compared to the previous month. These three restarts were all in the commercial sector, including one in the pharmaceutical industry, one in the catering industry, and one in the cultural industry.

### Wartime Currency Situation in Fujian Province: Circulation of National and Provincial Bank Notes

Some people may doubt that the bank's capital is 5 million yuan, but only 2.5 million yuan of paid-up capital has been received. Even if the full amount is used as an issuing reserve, it is still less than 60%. This is an ignorant statement about the operation of the banking business. The amount of capital is only to indicate the extent of the shareholders' liability. As for the bank's banknote reserve, it should not rely entirely on the capital. There are many sources of bank funds, such as deposits, which can be used as a reserve for issuance. Therefore, although the bank's capital is only 2.5 million, the funds that can be used are far more than this amount. It is found that the bank's issuing reserve is based on the regulations of the Ministry of Finance, with 60% in cash and 40% in guarantee. Before June 1936, the bank maintained the 60-40 regulation. After July, the cash reserve was more adequate, averaging more than 70%. For example, at the end of 1938, the amount of issuance was 12,078,003.60 yuan, and the cash reserve was 9,251,251.50 yuan, accounting for 76.38%. The guarantee reserve totaled 2,826,7512.10 yuan, accounting for 23.4%. Its contents are various unified public bonds, provincial construction public bonds, short-term treasury bills, etc., and all have been converted according to market prices. In reality, the number of people exchanging auxiliary notes for cash should not exceed 70%. Therefore, under the current situation, it is more than enough to cope with. If the cash preparation ratio is exceeded, all kinds of guarantee preparations have market prices, which are sufficient to cope with. With such full preparation, it is appropriate for the auxiliary currency notes to win good credit in the market and circulate smoothly. Since the Provincial Bank is a bank related to the provincial government, it is often suspected that in order to maintain its finances, it may inevitably print and issue banknotes as much as possible and promote them by relying on political power, which will inevitably cause inflation. In fact, the promotion and maintenance of the Provincial Bank's banknotes have never relied on the power of the provincial government. The reason why they can circulate in the society is because they have sufficient preparation and can maintain their good credit. As for the amount of loans from government agencies to the bank, the amount is very small, and the government has always maintained good credit. According to the bank's 1937 business report, loans to government agencies were only more than 1 million yuan, accounting for only 20% of the total loans. The provincial finance, with the efforts of the authorities to plan, the opening source has been effective, and the throttling has been greatly tightened in recent years. Therefore, there is no problem with revenue and expenditure, and there is no loan from the provincial bank except for short-term turnover. The provincial government's loan is mostly used for agricultural, industrial, and commercial construction projects, etc., which are not only harmless but also beneficial to the society.

### The Punishment of "Non-Citizens" in ××

— Zeng Zhaojun

× Country and our country have many differences, even just considering the soldiers fighting, they are already "as different as night and day." The glittering yellow military uniforms of the imperial army; their dark black leather boots, are certainly not something that our hardworking and austere warriors can dream of. But when it comes to the spirit and belief in combat, the × soldiers who fear death are simply not worthy of being compared with our country's courageous and forward-marching brothers! Because every warrior from our country who goes to the front lines is fighting for national liberation, willingly sacrificing their lives for the country; in Japan, it's not like that, ×××××××××, men and even women, once they reach a certain age, have the 'obligation' to serve in the military and provide 'service' with the army. If they are unwilling to go and attempt to evade, the label of "non-citizen" will be placed on their heads! This label is "modern" enough, but wearing it is not very comfortable.

Now, in Japan, almost all the able-bodied men have been drafted. Most of those seen on the streets are old people with foreheads full of wrinkles and small children skipping and jumping. The old men are teary-eyed, grieving for their sons who have become cannon fodder and their daughters who are thousands of miles away, resolving the sexual frustration of soldiers. The children are anxious, fearing that in less than two or three years, they will have to go to China to become their fathers' or older brothers' replacements. There was a shoemaker who repaired leather shoes, already forty-seven years old. One bright spring morning, just as he was about to start working, he picked up his pipe, which he had used for more than twenty years, and while stuffing it with tobacco, he mumbled, 'Tobacco is getting more expensive; there are no leather shoes to repair anymore. "War" is really not a good thing.' Before he could finish speaking, his wife ran in, holding a piece of paper with writing on it, shouting as she ran. The old man thought it was a letter and calmly took it to read. In less than two minutes, his face suddenly changed and he was sweating profusely. With a "thud," the old pipe, which he had carefully preserved for more than twenty years, escaped from his trembling hand and fell to the ground, breaking—it turned out that this was an order from the military department, telling him not to go far away within a week, in other words, it meant he was to be drafted. He discussed this with his wife, and they finally decided to go somewhere else to take refuge for a while. Three days later, not knowing whether he couldn't bear to leave his wife or had forgotten something, he quietly returned alone. He had just taken a sip of tea and was taking out his newly bought pipe from his side, just about to light it, when an urgent knock came booming in. He panicked and again dropped the newly bought pipe on the ground, pacing around in the hall in confusion. His wife ran out, hid him behind the toilet, and then ran to open the door. The military police officer standing at the front, with wide, glaring eyes, roared in anger, "Baka! Why did it take you so long to open the door? What kind of shady business are you old bitch up to in there?" "I—I was doing a woman's private business inside," the old woman answered, trembling all over. "Bullshit, the master is asking you, is your husband at home?" "Him? He went out two days ago," "Hmm," the captain spat with a sinister smile, "You old thing, you know how to lie. I saw him go in just now. We have been guarding here for two days. Brothers, search!" A group of burly men rushed in with a clamor, almost stomping the soil to the point of crying out in pain. Before long, the dead-like old man had been tied up very securely with hemp rope and dragged to the headquarters.

That night, his wife, with a basket filled with food in her left hand and a bundle of clothes in her right, ran to the prison to see her husband, taking three steps as two. The cold-faced jailer squinted and said, "Good! You can go straight from here and then turn left to that square to see your husband." The old woman trembled and, half-understanding, followed the jailer's instructions. She arrived! In the silent wilderness, there was only the sound of the north wind fiercely striking the trees. Where was her husband's shadow?

The above scene of tragedy reveals the contradictions within × people's country. Not only have the able-bodied soldiers been emptied out, but even the old and weak soldiers are filled with anti-war sentiments. Japan's feet are sinking deeper and deeper into the mire day by day. Conversely, our 450 million Chinese compatriots are all × with shared hatred and willing to die for the country!

### A Brief Account of the Restoration

— Qianshan

Alone on a peak hundreds of feet above sea level, silent, I leaned against the vermilion round pillar of the Martyrs' Shrine. Across the river, a verdant river island floated. In the blue sky, under the azure sky, there was not a single sail, not a single crow, as if entering a withered Zen, like an empty pool, like a water moon, like being forgotten by the world. Having trekked from the other side of the river, I now stand again by this shrine, preparing with the mindset of searching for a hole. This river, this peak hundreds of feet above sea level, at the foot of the mountain, by the side of the river, in the wasteland of a deserted village, I gazed intently as the light returned to the human world. I watched, I waved my hand.

That azure blue, that pure white, that bright red, passion made my heart boil, and brilliance made my eyes dazzle.

The sound of a bugle rang out. That victorious melody, the bright song of justice

As if throwing a stone into an ancient well, loneliness like death, transformed into ripples. The air stirred, and the river waves trembled. A calm heart: like a ship sailing in calm waters, suddenly submerged in darkness, buried in black waves that reached the sky, approaching death, tightly gripped by the terrifying hand of a demon, and then the clouds cleared and the rain stopped, the water receded and the tide lowered, and the shore of light was seen again.

Thank you for giving me a good opportunity to cross the river to C City. Just as I arrived, the flags had already changed color. In the vast and endless night, I saw a glimmer of dawn again.

On this riverside fortress, once occupied by the invaders, the × army left some traces. These are the shameful traces of the defeated! I happily picked them up!

Beside a crooked pagoda, I found a small bronze Buddha statue, a delicate and exquisitely carved ornament. Next to a cannon, I picked up a bundle of scarlet letters, a love letter from a lover to her beloved. And in the grass pile on the back mountain, near the cliff, I saw many × army corpses with their ancestral registers.

When descending the mountain, there was a square at the foot of the mountain, crowded with a vast crowd. Among them were soldiers wearing grass-green uniforms, and farmers displaying enthusiastic emotions. Everyone stood in a large circle, heads raised, with serious but also joyful expressions. After a while, the sound of a horn was heard, the sound of the flag being lowered.

"You haven't heard this sound for a long time! Haven't you?"

Listening to the officer's words, the people nodded, and several even shed tears. They were extremely excited, their mouths open, unable to say a word. They only used their clumsy lips to lick the salty tears hanging from their mouths.

After the flag lowering ceremony was over, I followed the crowd and listened to the officer's speech, which lasted for a full hour. The listeners did not feel tired at all.

### Starting with Banning Love Movies

— Xin Yi

When two people or a country reach a point of desperation, they will seek out trivial matters unrelated to the big picture to do, as a temporary relief of their tense mood, in order to alleviate the sadness accumulated in their hearts. The recent ban on young people watching love movies by the Japanese government is a most obvious example.

A Huitong telegram on the sixth of this month: Japanese Minister of Education Araki yesterday received the film industry to explain the new law passed by the government, prohibiting young people across the country from watching love movies. From the literal meaning of love movies, we may think that they have a bad influence, enough to harm the physical and mental health of young people. However, in Japan today, the whole country is filled with a very unusual atmosphere, permeated with the smell of gunpowder. We have to have another explanation for the Japanese government's ban on young people watching love movies.

Since the Japanese warlords launched the war of aggression against China, the whole country has been almost like madmen, restricting public opinion, suppressing thought, and implementing their strict control policies in various ways, striving to make everyone obedient in the clutches of the warlords, to be driven and slaughtered by them; and the first to be sacrificed by them are the Japanese youth. Under the claws of fascism, the Japanese youth have suffered all kinds of oppression, perhaps more than ever before.

Of course, the Japanese youth also have surging blood and emotions like the youth of our country, and need to burst outwards to satisfy their desire to pursue freedom and justice. However, they have been deceived and suffocated by their warlords. Their lives can no longer find light and heat, no longer breathe fresh air, and they are miserably groaning in this dim and melancholy dungeon.

Now, their warlords, under the guise of sweeping away the bad influence on young people, have formulated a new law prohibiting young people from watching love movies, wanting to use another new stimulus to give their failed ending of the invasion of China a chance to be concealed. They want to change the psychology of young people across the country, so that they blindly abandon all emotional factors, to accept the narrow so-called patriotic thought, and bravely participate in their so-called "construction of a new order in East Asia" war. In the hearts of their warlords, their "wartime system" is widely and urgently applied to various departments of the society, almost to concentrate the knowledge of airplanes, cannons, and tanks into the hearts of every young person, so that they abandon their innate emotional factors, and everyone becomes a fierce, brutal, and "glorious" henchman. The pitiful Japanese youth are walking into the grave under this irresistible pressure, against the tide of the times and historical evolution.

Speaking of the prohibition of young people watching love movies, in a good sense, it can certainly reduce various sexual temptations for young people, and improper hints between men and women; but love movies still have an undeniable value for the active meaning of life. Movies are art, and they use the screen to express the truth of human emotions. Humans have created many undertakings by pursuing love, which can be clearly seen from the pens of ancient and modern Chinese and foreign writers and poets. A world without love is cold, selfish, and mutually murderous. We can find some essence of life from movies (referring to excellent love movies) to relax our tense moods and the trickery and deception of the world, which is what Chuan Baifu said, "Using art to express painful emotions and increase the vitality of life," which should be the right of every passionate young person?

I remember there is a passage in the book *Youth Admonitions* translated by Li Suo: "Our strength and soundness depend on the extent to which we develop love... If we are full of love, no matter how frightening the circumstances may be, we can cope with and overcome them; if we have no love, we will be helpless." Therefore, as long as we understand the positive and noble meaning of love, we can certainly expand from narrow love to human sympathy and universal love, and we can also obtain the driving force for developing undertakings and creating undertakings.

When the invaders are unable to conceal their wrong actions and want to temporarily alleviate the contradictions and conflicts in their psychology, they vent their distress on young people. What should we feel when we see the right of young people in Japan to watch love movies being deprived?

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

He said, in order to make her forget her temporary melancholy:

"You are like it."

She blushed; women like to be praised for their beauty, especially in their youth. He also smiled contentedly. Finally, he pointed to the small bed and said:

"This is also rented for you." He paused, watched her expression for a moment, and then said, "I think you're tired, so you should go to bed early! If you need anything, call me. My name is Yuwen."

As soon as he left, she shouted loudly

"Yuwen... Yuwen..."

After he was summoned, he asked:

"What do you need?"

"Can you answer anything I need?"

He replied without thinking:

"Of course!"

"Then I need to go home!"

"..."

She cried, threw the flowers on her head to the ground, and crushed them with her feet. Her ruthlessness and disgust for the flowers were exactly her expression towards him. At this time, nothing in this room did not make her hate it, and made her miss her own bedroom, everything was in memory.

When he could no longer coax and comfort her, he could only leave. When he left, he left a crack in the door, allowing the eyes to monitor her. She was smart, she could know people's vigilance towards her. She was dissatisfied and slammed the door shut in anger. Her self-esteem reminded her of her own identity. She had never been beaten or scolded in her childhood, and she had never been criticized in her growth. She was born to be excessively protected. Wasn't she the only daughter loved by her parents like a heart and liver? She had never done a small chore—even washing a handkerchief required someone else's help. Sometimes, she vented her anger by breaking teacups or overturning tables and chairs. Wasn't she the aristocratic young lady who had exclusive maids serving her but was still not satisfied? She scorned men's enthusiasm, treated men as born servants. Wasn't she the queen who was admired by countless young men but treated them coldly? She despised everything in the present and lived in her own dream, wasn't she the proud one who held beautiful ideals and tried to create a happy world? ... She had never realized that she was just the daughter of a traitor—a small life of a slave.

Her past happy memories are now unfortunate wounds. She cried, using her own tears to mourn that memory and heal this wound. When a person uses crying to comfort themselves, it is more painful and more sad, especially a weak person like her.

After the door was closed, those eyes monitoring her, in order not to stimulate her emotions, could only shift to the small space of the door lock.

However, she thought she was beginning to wander in a free house: after a long time, she was even more tired. The white bedding commonly used by naval academy students on the bed tempted her to sleep. But she couldn't sleep. The color of the bedding led her into a moldy scenery—it seemed that a charming cold wind sent her to this world of snow. The snow drowned out all shapes and colors, the snow melted everything: a sea of snow, a desert of snow: as if lost in the snow, walking a narrow path in the snow circle. (Forty-two)
