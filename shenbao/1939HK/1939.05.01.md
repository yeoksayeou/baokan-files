### Japan's Pretext for Annexing China

— Luo Qian

I

Chairman Chiang recently, in refuting Konoe's statement regarding the "joint anti-communism" clause, made the following insightful remarks:

"The so-called joint anti-communism means forcing China to sign an anti-communist pact," requiring the stationing of troops in North China and designating Inner Mongolia as a special anti-communist zone... We can see that Japan merely wants to use the pretext of joint anti-communism to first control our country's military, and then control our country's politics, culture, and even diplomacy... General public opinion in the world may believe that Japan's so-called anti-communism is truly aimed at preventing Soviet Russia, but in reality, the agreements Japan seeks to conclude are not aimed at preventing communism, nor at preventing Russia, but are in fact using this pretext to subjugate China. Even if there is a meaning against Russia within it, it only occupies a small part, while the majority is aimed at destroying China."

Chairman Chiang's clear indication that the true content of Japan's so-called "joint anti-communism" is the destruction of China is entirely correct. In fact, over the years, Japan has regarded all national and people's liberation struggles of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people as "red" movements. Its so-called "anti-communism" is to prevent all national and people's liberation struggles. For example, during the First Great Revolution from 1925 to 1927, Japan attacked the then Chinese National Revolution under the name of "joint anti-communism." After the failure of the Great Revolution, Japan occupied the Northeast Provinces, attacked Shanghai, established the puppet Eastern Hebei "Anti-Communist" Autonomous Government, realized the "specialization of North China," and suppressed all national and people's revolutionary movements in China under the name of "joint anti-communism." It also concluded the "Joint Anti-Comintern Pact" with Germany and Italy to intensify its aggression against China. After the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, Japan launched a large-scale military invasion of mainland China under the name of "joint anti-communism." The concrete process of Japan's destruction of China over the past few years has fully proved the truth that "joint anti-communism" is "the destruction of China." Regarding this truth, no one, no party, should be allowed to have any distortion or illusion about the true content of Japan's "joint anti-communism" any longer. In order to oppose Japan's destruction of China and persist in the war of resistance until the final victory, the entire nation and all the people must rise up together to tear apart Japan's pretext of "joint anti-communism" for destroying China.

Since the true content of "joint anti-communism" is the destruction of China, then the inevitable conclusion should be: all people and parties participating in Japan's touted "joint anti-communism" are in fact accomplices and henchmen in Japan's destruction of China. Wang Jingwei, for example, openly issued declarations supporting Japan's "joint anti-communism" proposals. Wang Jingwei and his clique are now spreading rumors everywhere, saying that they support Japan's "joint anti-communism" but do not support the destruction of China. However, in fact, the day Wang Jingwei and his ilk supported Japan's "joint anti-communism," the Kuomintang Central Committee's resolution to permanently expel Wang Jingwei from the party and the proposal of national generals and the national people to demand the denunciation of Wang Jingwei clearly also show that they understood that Wang Jingwei's so-called "joint anti-communism" was merely a synonym for their support for Japan's destruction of China. This understanding is obviously entirely correct.

In fact, since the birth of the Chinese Communist Party, there have been numerous arguments in the history of the Chinese revolution proving that all people participating in "joint anti-communism" intentionally or unintentionally play the role of accomplices and henchmen in Japan's destruction of China. The course of the ten months of the War of Resistance has even more clearly pointed out this fact. Now, everyone can see that all those who violate national interests, unite with Trotskyite traitors, and carry out their treasonous and country-selling criminal acts under the banner of "anti-communism." Moreover, the CCP has more than once called on the entire nation and the national people, and now this truth should become a commonly recognized truth among the entire nation and the national people. We must no longer allow anyone to carry out traitorous activities under the pretext of "joint anti-communism." This is a critical requirement for opposing Japan's destruction of China and persisting in the War of Resistance.

II

Now we must further ask: Why does Japan insist on using "joint anti-communism" as its pretext for destroying China? The reason Japan touts "joint anti-communism" is precisely to directly strike a blow against the great power of the Chinese Communist Party, and at the same time to deceive and incite a segment of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people who misunderstand and hate the Communist Party to participate in "joint anti-communism," in order to achieve its goal of "using Chinese to control Chinese," splitting China's internal unity, and destroying China.

Secondly, because all vigorous, progressive, and revolutionary forces in China's resistance against Japan and national salvation, regardless of which class or party, must inevitably work with the Communist Party to complete the cause of national liberation, and the Communist Party, in order to complete the mission of ultimately liberating the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, must also closely cooperate with all these forces. Therefore, Japan's touting of "joint anti-communism" is also to strike at all vigorous, progressive, and revolutionary forces across the country that are united with the Communist Party in resisting Japan and saving the nation. In the past, during the era of the Great Revolution, and today, in the era of national resistance, it has always attempted to use this pretext to strike at the Kuomintang, the Three People's Principles, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, and all revolutionary patriots and political factions who resist Japan and save the nation. Readers only need to look at the recent interpretations of the Three People's Principles by Japanese parliamentarians to understand Japan's intention to eliminate the Three People's Principles, also using "anti-communism" as a pretext. Foreign Minister Arakawa publicly stated, "The Three People's Principles are undoubtedly communist in appearance and in fact, so Japan should strive to educate the Chinese people to eliminate them." (Tokyo dispatch on January 22) In addition, aren't Japanese traitors also spreading rumors everywhere about Chairman Chiang, saying that he has "surrendered to the Third International," "surrendered to the Communist Party," is "spiritually suffering," and is "red," thus proposing the slogans that "anti-communism" must eliminate the "Chiang regime" and "anti-communism" must "destroy the party"?

Thirdly, because under this pretext, Japan can obtain the assistance of all international anti-communist forces, and it can therefore more easily monopolize China. First of all, the fascist countries of Germany and Italy are its closest allies in "joint anti-communism." These countries, like Japan, under the banner of "joint anti-communism..."

In fact, even if there were no Communist Party in China, would Japanese imperialism not invade China? Absolutely not. From the "Anti-Comintern Pact" between Japan, Germany, and Italy, it can be seen that all the targets that the three fascist countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy want to invade, strike at, and eliminate belong to the "Comintern," so they must "prevent" it! Doesn't Abyssinia have a Communist Party? However, didn't Italy invade and occupy it under the pretext of "anti-communism"? Aren't German and Italian fascists demanding colonies in Africa under the pretext of "anti-communism"? However, there is no Communist Party there either—Japan has invaded many places in China in the past, but at that time, China did not have a Communist Party at all. So no one should think that if China did not have a Communist Party, Japan would not invade China—this kind of idea is either a naive and confused fantasy of children, or a smokescreen intentionally spread by spies and traitors for "joint anti-communism" and the destruction of China!

With the above three main reasons, Japan uses "joint anti-communism" as its pretext for destroying China. Regarding these reasons, the CCP has also pointed out these reasons more than once in front of the entire nation and the national people, and now they should be understood by the entire nation and the national people.

Therefore, we have always insisted on using the anti-Japanese national united front for saving China to counter Japan's anti-communist united front for destroying China, and using the international peace front to counter the aggressive front of Japan, Germany, and Italy's "joint anti-communism." This is our basic task of opposing Japan's destruction of China and persisting in the War of Resistance until the final victory.

III

But has everything mentioned above been understood by every Chinese and every party today? We cannot give a definite answer to this question right now. Facts prove that, apart from traitors and national betrayers, even within the anti-Japanese camp, there are still some people who have not or are unwilling to understand the simple principles mentioned above. Some, like Zhang Junmai and his ilk, in the past, when Wang Jingwei had not yet [omission] conspired with Wang Jingwei, colluded with each other, followed Wang Jingwei's will, and openly wrote to Comrade Mao Zedong, publishing his specific methods for "joint anti-communism." After Wang Jingwei [omission], on the one hand, they neither openly withdrew from the anti-Japanese front and went to the traitorous clique, nor did they openly oppose Wang Jingwei, admit their past mistakes in supporting Wang, and abandon their own "anti-communist" proposals. These people are still unwilling to understand our above-mentioned simple principles, and they will probably continue their "anti-communist" conspiracies in the anti-Japanese front. There are also some stubborn elements and backward elements who do not understand the greater righteousness. Subjectively, they may not approve of Japan [omission] destroying China, and some of them may even sincerely support Chairman Chiang's policy of resisting Japan and saving the nation. However, due to their factional prejudices, their ideas of power, their darkness and ignorance, and their misunderstanding and unfounded terror of the CCP, their course of action today is not "anti-Japan and eliminating traitors" but "anti-communism before resisting Japan." They mistakenly regard "anti-communism" as their central task, and some even regard "resisting Japan" and "anti-communism" as parallel, with "anti-communism while resisting Japan" as their two-in-one task. These people have also not understood the simple principles mentioned above. The existence of these two types of elements in the anti-Japanese camp is a great obstacle to persisting in the war of resistance until the final victory, because their "anti-communist" work, regardless of their subjective wishes, no matter how well they speak, and no matter how much they believe they are supporting the leader and the government, and supporting the Three People's Principles and the Kuomintang, in reality, they are intentionally or unintentionally helping Japan and acting as accomplices and lackeys in Japan's "joint anti-communism" and destruction of China. And Japan is consciously and deliberately inciting them, provoking them, and causing them to consciously or unconsciously fall into the mire of Japan's "joint anti-communism" and destruction of China, constantly recruiting some shameless traitors from among them to be their tools and pawns in destroying China.

Therefore, for people like Zhang Junmai, we should demand that they publicly express their attitude towards adhering to the national policy of resisting Japan, openly criticize their past mistakes in supporting Wang, publicly declare that they have severed all relations with Wang Jingwei and his ilk, and express their loyalty to the nation and the country in practical actions, in order to wash away the sins in their political lives.

For stubborn elements and backward elements, we should advise them with a serious attitude, make them understand the true content of Japan's "joint anti-communism," and make sure they do not fall into Japan's trap. We should make them realize that the Communist Party is not their enemy, but their friend. We should point out to them the danger of their "anti-communist" work; warn them that if they continue to develop on the path of "anti-communism," regardless of their subjective wishes, they will inevitably step into the mire of Japan's "joint anti-communism" and become Japan's tools and pawns. The development path of Wang Jingwei is the best living example. Perhaps they still think today that their "anti-communism" is to support the leader and the government, and to support the Three People's Principles and the Kuomintang, but we want to tell them in advance that in reality, they are opposing the leader who insists on resisting Japan, and opposing the Three People's Principles and the Kuomintang.

Under the principle that we sincerely demand that all conscientious Chinese people take unanimous resistance to Japan and national construction as paramount, consolidate the anti-Japanese national united front, and consolidate the long-term cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, in order to shatter Japan's poisonous plan of destroying China through "joint anti-communism."

IV

Finally, we must also ask: When Wang Jingwei accepted Japan's "joint anti-communism" conditions, what specific methods of "joint anti-communism" did he propose? In his telegram to the Kuomintang Central Committee on December 29 last year, he said:

"Since the Chinese Communists have declared that they are willing to strive for the realization of the Three People's Principles, they should thoroughly abandon their organization and propaganda, and abolish the special organization of their border region government and army."

Wang Jingwei's proposal is completely consistent with what Wang's henchman Zhang Junmai said in "An Open Letter to Mr. Mao Zedong" (see "Renaissance" No. 10). Because Wang Jingwei was permanently expelled from the party by the Kuomintang Central Committee, no one promoted his views. However, Zhang Junmai's "letter," which was instructed by Wang Jingwei and completely consistent with Wang Jingwei's proposals, was reprinted in many newspapers and widely distributed. Ye Qing and Wu Ning, who specialize in "joint anti-communism," even published it as the first article (see "Resistance and Culture" Vol. 3, No. 2). The reason for this, in the eyes of discerning people, is not difficult to understand.

Why exactly do Wang Jingwei and his ilk so resolutely advocate that the Communist Party "thoroughly abandon its organization and propaganda"? The reason for this, as we explained earlier when discussing why Japan wants to use "joint anti-communism" as its pretext for destroying China, is that they naturally want to advocate this, and must advocate this, and can only advocate this.

The people of the whole country will certainly not approve of the proposals of Wang Jingwei and his ilk, because no one can deny the achievements of the Chinese Communist Party in its arduous struggle for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people today, and because everyone can see that the Marxism-Leninism of the Chinese Communist Party is pointing out the correct and concrete path and method for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the Chinese people today. Therefore, "abolishing the Communist Party's organization and propaganda" is only beneficial to Japan, and not beneficial to the Chinese nation and the Chinese people.

Wang Jingwei and his ilk constantly promote the idea that, in order to "unify" China, the Communist Party should be abolished, and in order to "realize the Three People's Principles," Marxism-Leninism should be abolished. In the "unity" and "Three People's Principles" that Wang Jingwei and others want to realize, the Communist Party's organization and propaganda should of course be "thoroughly abolished," because the "unity" that Wang Jingwei advocates today is to "unify China under Japanese imperialism," and the "Three People's Principles" that Wang Jingwei wants to realize are the "revised Three People's Principles" that Foreign Minister Arakawa spoke of, that is, the pseudo-"Three People's Principles" that support Japan's destruction of China. But the true unification of China, the true realization of the Three People's Principles, under China's specific historical conditions, must have the Chinese Communist Party and its Marxism-Leninism. The greatness of Mr. Sun Yat-sen lies in his ability to clearly see this truth, and history has also proven it. In the past, China's disunity and the failure to realize the Three People's Principles were not because of the existence of the Communist Party or Marxism-Leninism. Facts prove that the victory of the First Great Revolution was precisely because of the close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. If it had not been for Japan's poisonous plan of "joint anti-communism" at that time, China would have already achieved true unification and truly implemented the Three People's Principles today. The reason why China can achieve the victory of national unity and perseverance in the War of Resistance today is also precisely because of the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Now, if the whole country, from top to bottom, does not fall for Japan's poisonous plan of "joint anti-communism" again, China will certainly be able to achieve true unification and true Three People's Principles. Facts also prove that the Kuomintang struggled for nearly forty years before its reorganization. At that time, there was no Communist Party or the existence of Marxism-Leninism, but it did not unify China or realize the Three People's Principles. After the failure of the Great Revolution, the Communist Party was completely in a state of being oppressed and powerless, and the propaganda of Marxism-Leninism was severely prohibited, but the Kuomintang did not unify China or realize the Three People's Principles either.

Some people in China often emptily support "unity," thinking that as long as China has one party and one doctrine, China will be "unified." In fact, this is a completely wrong idea. This is called a superficial view, and it is a kind of unrealistic error. Because the true unification of China can only be achieved after the true realization of the Three People's Principles, and allowing the free existence and development of various revolutionary parties and mass organizations is precisely the main content of democracy. Without the implementation of democracy and people's livelihood, we should openly say that the unification of China is impossible. In order to achieve the true unification of China, we must resolutely oppose anyone's erroneous idea of ​​emasculating the Three People's Principles into one principle. And the Chinese Communists sincerely support this true Three People's Principles, and the CCP will support the Three People's Principles with firm conviction and enthusiasm, and will wage a relentless struggle against all those who defile and distort the Three People's Principles. Without sincerely and practically accepting it, the realization of the true Three People's Principles is impossible. As for those who attempt to use shouting "support for the Three People's Principles" as a pretext for "joint anti-communism" against the Communist Party and Marxism-Leninism, the future of these people will inevitably be the path that Wang Jingwei is taking today. We want to shout loudly to the people of the whole country that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles must not become a pretext for "joint anti-communism," Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles must not be dismembered and emasculated, and Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles must become concrete and practical today, not empty slogans!

Therefore, the CCP can only resolutely reject the demand of Wang Jingwei and his ilk, based on Japan's "joint anti-communism," to "thoroughly abandon its organization and propaganda." The Chinese Communist Party declares publicly to the world and the people of the whole country that it is absolutely not prepared to abolish its political and organizational independence at any time and under any conditions. For the unification of China, for the realization of the Three People's Principles, and for the final liberation of the entire nation and the national people, it has been so in the past, it is so now, and it will be so in the future.

Secondly, why exactly do Wang Jingwei and his ilk so resolutely advocate that the Communist Party "abolish the special organization of its border region government and army"? The reason for this is also very simple, because the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army are all forces that resolutely resist Japan, truly implement the Three People's Principles, and faithfully struggle for the establishment of a unified new China. This is what Japan does not like, and of course it is also what Wang Jingwei and his ilk oppose.

Is the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government a component of the National Government today? Of course it is. The opposition between the Central Government and the Border Region Government has long been abolished, and the relationship between the Central Government and the Border Region Government has returned to normal. The Central Government has already verbally and practically recognized the Border Region Government. What is lacking today is just a written order from the Central Government formally announcing the recognition of the Border Region Government. This is certainly an opportunity that is easily exploited by traitors to carry out instigation and discord, and we believe that this opportunity must be filled, and should be filled quickly.

But we do not deny that the Border Region Government has many different points compared with other local governments in China. These different points may be the basic reason why people consider the Border Region Government "special," right? But "special" also has various kinds of special. Generally speaking, it can be divided into three types: the first type is the "special" of "joint anti-communism" and destroying China; the second type is the "special" of not implementing the Three People's Principles; the third type is the "special" of resolutely implementing the Three People's Principles. The first type exists in the occupied areas, so we will not discuss it today. The second and third types exist in the war-resisting areas, so we should discuss them today.

Which kind of "special" is the "special" of the Border Region Government? We should not generally oppose "special," but should specifically investigate what kind of "special" the "special" of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government is. This is the proper attitude that everyone with a mind and capable of thinking must adopt when solving any concrete problem.

What exactly is the "special" of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region? In a word, it is that it truly implements the Three People's Principles. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region not only resolutely implemented the principle of striving for national independence, but it also resolutely implemented democracy and people's livelihood. It has been like this in the past, and it is even more so now. Since the launch of the nationwide War of Resistance, the "special" of the Border Region in implementing nationalism has basically become "ordinary" in the nationwide perseverance in the war. However, in terms of implementing democracy and people's rights, the Border Region Government still basically maintains its "special," and therefore also preserves many "special" in nationalism. The Border Region Government has basically realized Mr. Sun Yat-sen's principle of democracy and principle of people's livelihood, while in his provinces, in terms of the principle of democracy, it is only beginning to be realized, and in terms of the principle of people's livelihood, most have not even begun. This is because the "special" of other provinces not realizing democracy and people's livelihood exists, so it reflects the "special" of the Border Region Government implementing democracy and people's livelihood. This kind of special is of course a good "special," a "special" that should be preserved and promoted, not a "special" that should be abolished, because what we want to build today is a new China based on the Three People's Principles, and the "special" of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region today is just the prototype of the new China based on the Three People's Principles. As long as the new China based on the Three People's Principles is successfully established, that is, when the Three People's Principles are implemented throughout China and there is no special state of unrealization, then the "special" of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region will also become "ordinary." This is the only correct path and method to abolish the "special" of the Border Region. There is no other method.

We sincerely hope that all people and parties who are truly willing to strive for the establishment of a new China based on the Three People's Principles will never be satisfied with the status quo of China. Although China is now resolutely implementing the nationalism of the War of Resistance, it is still very far from the full implementation of the Three People's Principles. Everything in China today is changing and progressing rapidly. Old China is giving way to new China, and old systems and old laws are being replaced by new systems and new laws. Only Mr. Sun Yat-sen's true ideal of the Three People's Principles can become the highest standard for measuring the good and bad of all people, systems, and laws today, and determining their acceptance or rejection. For example, according to today's old standards, some bad people who covet national glory, are corrupt, passively work, are shameless, and are conscienceless can not be subject to any legal sanctions and can live comfortably and freely, but according to the highest standard of the Three People's Principles, then this group of bastards should at least be imprisoned. For example, according to today's old standards, a certain system is illegal, but according to the highest standard of the Three People's Principles, this system is precisely legal. Only by making the ideal of the Three People's Principles the highest standard for us to measure all people, systems, and laws can we truly make the Three People's Principles "the highest principle of the Republic of China." Today, the task of building the country together by the people of the whole country and all parties is precisely to transform the old into the new, to raise the backward to the advanced, based on the highest principles of the Three People's Principles, rather than to degenerate the new into the old and to make the advanced accommodate the backward. Otherwise, the call for building the country together is empty talk, and the true realization of the Three People's Principles is impossible.

Therefore, if everyone can truly make the Three People's Principles the highest principle of the founding of the Republic of China, then this advanced special of the Border Region, which has realized the Three People's Principles, should not only not be opposed, but should also be welcomed and emulated. In China, which is in the midst of resisting Japan and building the nation, today there is to be a great competition across the country based on the highest principles of the Three People's Principles, "striving for progress." Whoever can implement the Three People's Principles first should be given glorious rewards. Only in this way can we arouse a nationwide upsurge in the common struggle for the realization of the Three People's Principles and quickly make the backward China a new China based on the advanced Three People's Principles!

Therefore, the people of the entire Border Region and the CCP must continue to insist on the "special" of the Three People's Principles that have already been implemented in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. This insistence is precisely to promote the progress of the whole country, and at the same time to truly eliminate the "special" established by Japanese imperialism in China, and to change the "special" of those who resist Japan but have not implemented the Three People's Principles. And the reason why Wang Jingwei became a traitor is precisely because he demanded the abolition of the progressive "special" of the Border Region Government and the like. Everyone must recognize clearly that Wang Jingwei is not a person who opposes "general special." He is a person who supports a special that will destroy the country and opposes a special that promotes progress. Whoever thinks that all special should be opposed, and therefore the special of the Border Region should also be opposed, is intentionally or unintentionally becoming a prisoner of Wang Jingwei and an echo of Wang Jingwei, and is actually helping Japan's poisonous plan of "joint anti-communism" to destroy China.

Therefore, today, we hope that the Central Government will quickly announce the order recognizing the Border Region Government, in order to prevent the traitors and Wang Jingwei's like from instigating opportunities for discord, so that the Border Region Government can better offer its strength and experience to the construction of the new China based on the Three People's Principles. As for the demand of Wang Jingwei and his ilk that the Border Region Government should abolish the special of the Three People's Principles that have already been implemented, we can only resolutely reject it. Not abolishing this "special" is precisely because the Communist Party is not supporting the Three People's Principles in Wang Jingwei's style, but is truly supporting Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three People's Principles. This kind of sincere support is not like those political groups who only seek to rise in rank and get rich, and who are unprincipled and shameless.

Editorial

### China's Labor Circles Support the War of Resistance

The Chinese nation is currently facing a critical moment of survival under the armed invasion of Japanese ××ist fascist militarists. All sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, regardless of whether they are propertied or propertyless, or whether they are farmers, workers, merchants, students, or soldiers, have been forced to choose between submitting to slavery or fighting for survival. Unity and cooperation in persevering in the War of Resistance will lead to survival, independence, and freedom, while division and mutual strife will only lead to death, enslavement, and shame. This is the reality of the situation and the truth of the matter. Therefore, history has entrusted the broad laboring masses today with the task of firmly supporting the Central Government, supporting the supreme leader, supporting cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, supporting national unity, and supporting the War of Resistance to the end, to fight against the invading Japanese ××ist fascist army, to fight against the Japanese ×× lackeys and traitors like Wang ××, and to fight for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the realization of a new China based on the revolutionary Three Principles of the People.

Similarly, the Chinese government, all Chinese parties, all nationalities, and people from all walks of life must, with a spirit of impartiality and selflessness, with a spirit of putting the nation first, the people first, resisting Japan first, and unity first, sincerely and enthusiastically unite the laboring masses, assist the laboring masses, and trust the laboring masses, and work closely together to strive for victory in the War of Resistance and success in national construction. Conversely, any proposition or activity that undermines the unity of the Chinese laboring masses, any proposition or activity that prevents the Chinese laboring masses from participating in the War of Resistance and national construction, and any proposition or activity that provokes labor-capital disputes, party cooperation, or inter-group emotions, all violate the supreme leader's intention of uniting the country, violate the Central Government's national policy of resisting Japan and building the nation, and violate the entire nation's demand for liberation. We must use our collective and tenacious strength to give them a merciless blow. Recently, Wang Jingwei and others have been promoting "anti-communism and peace" on the one hand, and on the other hand, they have been picking labor-capital disputes and provoking the feelings of workers and the government. These conspiracies are to harm China’s independent movement, which is to harm the future of the laboring masses in resisting the war for survival and must be given a merciless and tenacious blow.

Since the 21st month of the War of Resistance, the Chinese laboring masses, whether on the front lines, in the rear, under × cover, or overseas, have disregarded their own interests, disregarded their personal safety, disregarded threats and inducements, either participated in the War of Resistance, stepped up production, assisted in battlefield services, promoted fundraising, or helped prevent air raids, poison gas, and traitors. There are even those who have joined the ranks and engaged in the most courageous and tenacious struggles against the × army, the puppet army, the traitors, and the puppets. This kind of action is not only the glory of the Chinese labor community, but also the manifestation of the great spirit of the Chinese nation. We hope that the laboring masses at home and abroad will be good at maintaining and developing this great spirit and launch a more heroic and tenacious struggle. We also hope that government authorities, parties, factions, and leaders from all walks of life will recognize the great strength of the labor community and make greater efforts to develop the national labor force more widely and resolutely, coordinate with the strength of the vast number of farmers, and support the great cause of resisting Japan and building the nation. Only in this way can the War of Resistance achieve final victory and the nation-building can achieve smooth success. However, to achieve the general mobilization of the vast labor community and farmers, we must also follow the great policy of aiding farmers and workers left to us by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. We must also follow the supreme leader's successive instructions and the Central Government's successive orders, and promulgate and implement reasonable labor laws and factory laws as soon as possible to rescue, organize, and train the vast number of unemployed workers and exiled workers, protect the minimum living conditions of workers, and give workers adequate time for physical exercise, education, and entertainment. It is particularly important to step up the elimination of illiteracy among workers and to step up the education of workers to read and write, because only when workers obtain a reasonable life and obtain the necessary organization and training can they improve their production efficiency, support the great cause of resisting Japan and building the nation more effectively and extensively, and protect the liberation of the Chinese nation and the realization of the Three Principles of the People.

The two armies are now fighting in the streets. According to a telegram from Guilin, the Japanese army is attacking Mount Dashan with 5,000 troops. The Chinese army retreated to the western mountains after paying a considerable price to continue the war.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] According to a military announcement here last night, a certain unit of the 155th Division of the Chinese Army, together with a contingent of about 5,000 local militia, counterattacked Jiangmen and are now engaged in a fierce battle.

Shanxi Province

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 29th] The situation in Shanxi is improving. The various attacking troops are gradually gaining the initiative. The war results in southern Shanxi are particularly good. The task of attrition warfare and annihilation warfare has been achieved. The × is in a dilemma, like fish in a cauldron. Strategically, we have achieved a major victory. The offensive momentum of the × has been greatly reduced, and most of them are holding on to their strongholds and adopting a defensive posture. In the past two days, they have only used small units to make roundabout raids, so there has been no major contact. The × invading south along the Baijin Highway in southeastern Shanxi, numbering about four or five thousand, have been successively defeated to the north after several days of fierce attacks. The war in that area has subsided. The × in the Zhongyang-Fenxi area have been active in order to contain our army's eastward advance, so there have been small contacts from time to time in recent days. There has been little change in the Zhengtai and Tongpu northern sections. On the evening of the 25th, there was a fierce battle at Heilongguan all night. The × stubbornly resisted, and the battle was still going on at noon on the 26th. The × in the Anyi-Yuncheng area of southern Shanxi are attempting to counterattack, and we have been closely monitoring them. There has been no contact in Hejin, Jishan and other places.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 29th] A part of the × north of Lishi invaded Gukou Town and was defeated by us. On the 26th, more than 300 cavalry from a rapid force suddenly increased. Our troops in the north and south of Dawu ambushed in coordination on the evening of the 6th, and the battle was quite fierce.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 30th] More than 100 × from Beiguan invaded Hequ on the morning of the 26th. We blocked them in the Yaowangping and Changwugou areas. By night, the × had occupied Yaowangping and continued to invade west. After our reinforcements bravely counterattacked, the × retreated to Yaowangping and Yangjialing, and remained in a stalemate with us. There was no change as of noon on the 27th. More than 100 × in Shenchi moved towards Wuzhai in two routes on the 26th, and the × in Jingle also invaded west in separate groups, with the appearance of attacking Lan County. We are dividing our forces to meet them.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 30th] In the Yanbei area, our guerrillas have repeatedly achieved great feats. Due to traffic obstruction, news is delayed. According to reports from the front, a certain guerrilla unit of ours attacked Hunyuan on the evening of the 13th and entered the city at midnight. After three hours of hand-to-hand combat, more than 100 × were killed. The remnants were unable to support themselves and abandoned the city and fled. We obtained a lot of spoils of war. Hunyuan is the gateway to Datong. It is surrounded by ×. We did not consider it convenient to defend for a long time, so we burned down the × warehouse and withdrew at dawn.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 29th] (1) The × in Xia County attacked Shicun and Duan Village east of Anyi on the afternoon of the 6th and were repelled by our army. Another unit attacked Wanggukou in the south and was counterattacked by a certain unit of ours, killing more than 100 ×. The remnants retreated to Xia County. (2) On the morning of the 27th, more than 3,000 × were added to Quwo from the north and bombarded our various positions in the southeast. They have been in contact with our guerrillas for several days, and the battle is fierce. (3) The × in the south gate of Taigu have been under siege by us since the 27th for two days, killing more than 300 ×. We took advantage of the victory to break through the ×'s barbed wire and occupied two blockhouses, capturing more than 100 × rifles and two light machine guns. The × could not support themselves and burned several houses in the town. We are still continuing the fierce attack.

[Central News Agency, Dali, 30th] The × in Weiguo (north of Xia County), numbering seven or eight hundred, attacked Xiaowang Village and Guoniubao (southeast of Wenxi) from Dayang Village on the morning of the 28th and were repelled by our army. Our army immediately advanced towards Wenxi. On the morning of the 29th, it had passed the suburbs of the city and was engaged in a fierce battle with the ×.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 30th] More than 1,000 × who invaded Gucheng Town in Wuxiang, southeastern Shanxi, and more than 2,000 × in Shipan Town and west of Yushe, all retreated to Nanguan Town and the vicinity of Beiguan (south of Taigu). Before leaving, they burned down all the houses in Shipan and Gucheng Towns. More than 400 × in Qingyuan were attacked by guerrillas in the Shecun area (north of Qingyuan) on the 26th and were surrounded by us. Dozens of people were annihilated. Then, under the cover of artillery fire, they invaded Shecun. Two platoons of our officers and soldiers bravely sacrificed themselves. Our reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce flanking attack on the ×, which was then driven away. More than 100 × in Jiaocheng went to reinforce and were also repelled by us.

[Minge News Agency, Hequ, 30th] The × who invaded Pian Guan have recently divided into three routes to attack west. They are currently fighting with a certain unit of ours near Yangweigou (80 li east of Hequ). Near Hualin Fort, the × and we also had contact. In the suburbs of Pian Guan, our army has surrounded the city. The defending × have all retreated and gathered in the east. The rear of the × attacking west has been cut off by our army.

[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 30th] On the morning of the 26th, a part of the × in Yanchi and Duan Village sneaked into Xuangukou (southeast of Anyi) and attacked a certain position of our army. After being severely attacked by us, they fled in embarrassment. Also, on the morning of the 25th, a part of the × in Jiexian attacked east and was ambushed by our army near Canfang Village, killing and wounding dozens of ×. The remnants fled west to Zhangdian. Houwang is still under our encirclement. The × near Yicheng and Fushan are in a state of confrontation with us.

[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 30th] On the evening of the 24th, 5-600 × jointly invaded Liujia Yuan, which belongs to the Zhao area of Zhaocheng and Wan'an. On the morning of the 25th, a part of the × cavalry, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked Leishang Village in Fenxi. A certain unit of ours is giving them a severe blow. Another unit of ours attacked the × in Liujia Yuan at noon on the 25th. The × fled in panic eastward through Huangcun and were ambushed by our troops in Caojiazhuang. The × were killed and wounded and fled in panic to Zhaocheng. We then successively recovered Liujia Yuan, Huangcun, Caojiazhuang and other villages. In this battle, eight or ninety × were killed or wounded. We captured a number of horses and a part of military supplies.

[Minge News Agency, Shilou, Mid-day] A certain unit of ours attacking Wenxi advanced to the vicinity of Daxiang Village in Wenxian on the evening of the 22nd and severely damaged the highway from Dabai to Wenxi. Then, a part of the ambush was set up near Dongcun to wait for the ×. At about 7:00 AM on the 23rd, a part of the × in Wenxi sneaked out of Dongcun. Our ambush opened fire violently. The × retreated to Dongcun and resisted stubbornly. After a fierce battle for more than three hours, the × collapsed and retreated to Wenxi, killing more than 40 ×. At this moment, our army is pressing towards Wenxi City.

### Yunnan Medicine "Insurance Pills" Can Replace Imported Anesthetics; Drug Research Institute Reports Chemical Verification Results

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 29th] Since the Central Drug Research Institute moved to Chongqing last year, it has been aware that China's wound medicine has mostly relied on foreign countries, which is very uneconomical during the War of Resistance. Yunnan medicinal materials such as "Insurance Pills" and "Jingang Powder" are well-known, so they have been thoroughly studied. The results have now been obtained, and their efficacy is considered to be very good. Liu Shaoguang, director of the institute, specially invited people from all walks of life today to make a public report on the research results, believing that "Insurance Pills" are an important medicine for paralyzing parasympathetic nerves, and their value is above that of Caisobel and Fritillaria. They are of great help for wound relief, alcohol prohibition, and smoking cessation, and can replace the use of imported atropine and scopolamine.

### ×'s Foreign Exchange Control in North China Has Almost Completely Failed; British Newspaper's Lengthy Commentary

[Central News Agency, London, Day] The Financial News published a commentary yesterday, the full text of which is very long, saying that Japan's foreign exchange control and import control in North China have almost completely failed. The reason why trade in North China has not completely stopped today is that the Japanese side understands where the core of the problem lies and does not want to insist on the full implementation of its control regulations. However, it is impossible to determine when the Japanese side will announce the actual implementation. Therefore, all trade contracts, both long-term and short-term, cannot be concluded. At the moment, all sectors in Britain are paying close attention to the progress of the Chinese military. According to news from China, China has already achieved some important achievements.

### × Will Issue Counterfeit Money in Shanghai

The bank will print banknotes to be used in various parts of Central China. The significance of the bank's establishment is to "promote trade between Central China and foreign countries" and there is no intention to exclude Chinese legal tender.

### Japan's Invasion of China Encounters Unprecedented Difficulties; The Conspiracy of a Quick Victory and a Quick End Has Fundamentally Failed; The Japanese Army Is Stuck in the Mud and Is Besieged by Guerrillas

Soviet Newspaper Editorial

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Moscow, 30th Tass telegram: Soviet Commentary, saying that the Japanese warlords' plan to occupy and subdue China in the shortest possible time has fundamentally failed. After the Japanese army seized Hankou and Guangzhou, they invaded central China. However, the further aggressive actions of the Japanese army have encountered special difficulties. The Japanese army units are far away from their main base. Their transportation has been constantly threatened by the increasingly developed guerrilla activities in their rear. Powerful and effective guerrilla activities have already occurred in the areas occupied by the Japanese army, and they are rising daily. The heroism of the Chinese guerrillas has written a most praiseworthy chapter in the history of the Chinese people's struggle. The guerrillas and regular army in the Chinese army have transformed the rear of the Japanese army into a real front. The Japanese army is forced to transfer a strong force to deal with the guerrillas, so all kinds of difficulties have occurred on the Japanese warlords' side. The economic situation in the rear and at home of the Japanese army is also chaotic, the reserves have been exhausted, and there is an extreme lack of raw materials. The public's dissatisfaction with the war and the pain of imperialism are constantly developing in the rear of Japan, while China's strength is growing stronger and stronger in the process of the national liberation war. The sympathy and assistance of all progressive people throughout the civilized world naturally supports China.

### National Foreign Trade Statistics for March

### Comforting the Inspection Group on the Northwestern Shanxi Battlefield (Part 2)

— Ji Chang

Furthermore, at the joint gathering of the entire regiment of Commander Dong's army, they nurtured the thought that domestic war might reignite after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. After a heated discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that there would be no more division within the country. Cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party was long-term, not only for jointly resisting Japan but also for jointly building the nation. Other units also put forward many opinions, such as the importance of work related to puppet troops and the urgency of organizing the masses and training the entire countryside. Some units acknowledged their lack of progress and hoped to receive assistance from all parties. Some units admitted that their cooperation with friendly forces was insufficient, and even frictions occurred. In addition to feeling ashamed, they expressed their willingness to do their best to correct themselves. Joint gatherings often extended to four or five hours. Through self-introductions, the guests and hosts, superiors and subordinates, felt no restraint whatsoever. Due to the difficulties of the environment, the consolation gifts from the consolation group could not be abundant. Therefore, the significance of the consolation was that the spirit exceeded the material. Speaking of this, the presentation of the national flag best represented the meaning of spiritual comfort. Detachment Leader Mao said, "This is the first time we have received consolation." Other units also regarded the presentation of the flag as an extremely solemn event. Indeed, on the guerrilla battlefield, seeing the national flag of the motherland brought unexpected joy.

The two greatest gains of this consolation tour were: first, the communication with the rear areas, and second, the improvement of the relationship between the garrison troops and local organizations and the people.

The Northwest is the front line of national defense. Even on this fiery front line, that is, even within the guerrilla base areas, there is a distinction between the rear areas. Under emergency circumstances, the consolation tour group departed for the front. Seeing that the general public was still carrying out their activities as usual, and the front-line troops were even more calm and composed in their guerrilla warfare life, this point is worthy of the people in the rear areas to emulate. For example, the Guannan Guerrilla Army in XX had been criticized for their poor military discipline. After a detailed investigation by the consolation group, it was learned that the root cause of this matter was the need for grain in the local area and the violation of military discipline by some bad elements. This discovery can enhance mutual understanding between the army and the people, and can also remind the authorities to pay attention and provide lessons for friendly forces. For example, the loss of Shenchi was objectively due to the poor terrain of Shenchi, making it difficult to defend the city. However, people in the rear areas did not understand the reason and harbored distrust towards some troops of the 25th Army. After the consolation efforts of the consolation group, they understood the actual situation. In Shuoxian and Shenchi, they had personally seen that this unit had recently won many trophies, such as electrical wires and railway tracks. This not only enabled the general public to understand the truth and strengthen the relationship between the army and the people, but also made the people in the rear areas feel infinitely inspired. In addition, the things that the front line lacked were often unknown to the rear areas. Through their consolation, the compatriots in the rear areas knew how to help the front-line troops. This large-scale consolation in northwestern Shanxi was the first time. After this consolation, not only did the working comrades in the rear areas gain a lot of knowledge and insights from the returned reports, but the front-line troops also began to feel that their past cultural and entertainment work was insufficient and hoped that such a consolation group could frequently go to the front.

An important gain of the consolation tour group was the improvement of the relationship between the troops in the area and local organizations and the masses. Because the consolation tour group was jointly formed by representatives from various leading organizations in the second district of Shanxi, they could not only inspect local organizations but also further provide local organizations with suggestions, assistance, and guidance for the cooperation and coordination between the garrison troops and the people. According to the consolation group's report, in addition to the well-established Eighth Route Army Mao Detachment, the Death Squad and Guerrilla Regiment were also able to establish close ties with local organizations. Civil affairs work was good, and the places where they were stationed had masses acting as sentries. In addition, local working comrades were also able to cooperate with the garrison troops to carry out work related to puppet troops. To the east of the Tie Road in the county, there were still working comrades working arduously in the district. However, some anti-Japanese troops did not perform sufficiently in this regard, resulting in a certain gap between the military and the people and between the military and the government. The consolation group was able to use persuasive and explanatory methods to improve and strengthen the relationship between the military and the government and between the military and the people. For example, after the loss of Ningwu, the general public did not understand the strategy and tactics and blamed the loss on the cavalry. The consolation group was able to help local work by explaining the incident to the masses. After the loss of Ningwu, the garrison troops retreated before notifying the local working comrades, who remained in the front lines because they did not know the news, resulting in minor losses. The consolation group tactfully made suggestions to the garrison troops, and the army deeply regretted their past mistakes and immediately ordered all subordinate units to earnestly protect the local working comrades. The local government of Shenchi was stationed in the Nanshan area, and the 35th Army was stationed in the Beishan area. The connection was very insufficient. When the enemy retreated from Shenchi, the government did not care, leaving an empty city, which became a place for traitors and gangsters to operate. What was regrettable was that the local government could not fully accept the suggestions, and as a result, various organizations could not be fully improved.

In addition to this, during its 50-day work, the consolation tour group discovered many noteworthy things. Now, it is presenting several particularly important ones for the reference of local authorities and people throughout the country.

First, there are many propaganda materials from enemy deception in the area, while our propaganda materials are relatively few. It is hoped that the rear areas can transport a large quantity and send printed propaganda materials to the front lines and the enemy areas.

Second, in the Shuoxian, Hecheng, and Ningwu areas, there are so-called "XX Squads" who often engage in banditry. In addition, some deserters from bad units have become bandits and harass the people. It is hoped that the authorities will find ways to rectify this.

Third, Pingguan and Hecheng originally produce little grain, while there are many garrison troops. Shenchi and Shuoxian have more grain, but it is purchased by the enemy at high prices and imported into the enemy areas. It is hoped that the authorities will have a unified method.

Increased Import Surplus in Japan's Foreign Trade

The first quarter increased by 50 million compared to last year. Exports decreased by 13 million yen.

[Shanghai Correspondence] Mainland newspapers report that in the first quarter of this year, Japan's trade with countries other than the "Yen Bloc" had a large import surplus, with the surplus amounting to 199,737,000 yen. It is found that during this period, Japan imported goods from countries other than the "Yen Bloc," mostly raw materials for heavy industry, especially raw materials for the manufacture of munitions under the current emergency situation. The general public recognizes this point as important. Compared with the same period last year, exports decreased by 13,477,000 yen, while imports increased by 57,300,000 yen. This is particularly noteworthy because Japan's wartime situation makes it increasingly difficult to export products to foreign countries. Light industry and small industry have always been characteristic of Japan's manufacturing structure, and their exports account for a large part. Now, due to the emergency of the war against China and the constant need to prepare for any international contingencies, light industry and small industry seem to be rapidly giving way to heavy industry, especially the munitions industry. Japan tries to import goods into the Three Northeastern Provinces and North China, which are so-called "Yen Areas," and this is increasing. However, Japan's exports to the "Yen Bloc" do not directly result in the acquisition of currency. Japan has indeed obtained the raw material resources of the Three Northeastern Provinces and North China. According to the latest analysis, Japan obtains these raw materials, mostly by bartering with Japanese goods imported into the same region.

### Southeastern Shanxi in the Circle of Flames

— Bei Liu, Special Airmail from Xi'an, April 23

1.  A Risky Encirclement

Recently, as the enemy intensified its "mopping-up" operations in North China and began its risky plan to attack the Northwest, the situation in southeastern Shanxi became tense again. Seventy or eighty traitors traveled from Anyang and Xingtai to southeastern Shanxi to carry out major activities. Enemy aircraft also constantly scouted and bombed various strongholds in southeastern Shanxi. All of this was the prelude to the enemy's attack on southeastern Shanxi. At the beginning of April, the enemy mobilized heavy troops from the Tongpu, Zhengtai, Pinghan, and Daqing railway lines, moving in several directions to launch an offensive against us. Enemy chieftain Sugiyama first went from Taiyuan to Jiexiu to plan a conspiracy. Regiment Commander Po Nan also went to Qixian to command. As a result, flames of war ignited everywhere in southeastern Shanxi.

The first to launch the offensive were the four or five thousand enemies in Pingyao and Jiexiu, taking a position of mutual support, dividing into two routes to invade southeastward. They were met with our firm resistance. The enemy even released a large amount of poisonous gas to continue the assault southeastward. The enemy in Hongdong, Fushan, and Anze were tasked with invading eastward on the southern route. The enemy in Qixian and Taigu were tasked with moving northward towards Zihongkou and Malingguan, plotting to attack Qin County and Qinyuan. In addition, the two or three thousand enemies in Pinging and Heshun, south of the Zhengtai Road, also began to move southward. The enemies in northern Henan, Wu'an, Shexian, Boai, and Qinyang also gradually advanced westward. The enemies planned to replay the failed battle of "the nine-pronged encirclement of southeastern Shanxi last spring."

Targeting the enemy's conspiracy, we launched a swift and overwhelming counter-offensive on all fronts. On April 6, the operation began. The western section of the Zhongtiao Mountains echoed with the signal cannons of victory. Our mighty Iron Eagles also flew to southern Shanxi, carrying out fierce bombing raids on the enemy. Brave soldiers of the army advanced into Xiaxian City and fought a fierce street battle with the enemy for two days. Most of the large and small strongholds in Anyi, Yuncheng, Xiaxian, and Wenxi were recaptured by our soldiers. At the same time, the enemies in Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Hongdong suffered fatal blows from us. The enemies on other routes were also severely battered by us and could not advance further. The piece of meat that the enemies had coveted for a long time not only could not be eaten but also suffered a bloody nose and swollen face, with their teeth being knocked out.

2.  Crushing the Enemy's Conspiracy

The enemies who invaded Heshun and Liaoxian this time were mostly poorly clothed and in a state of disarray. This proves that the enemies have reached the end of their rope and also prevents the enemy from adopting the policy of "procuring on the spot."

"Procuring on the spot" is not only a concrete application of the enemy's vicious policy of "controlling China with Chinese," but also tells us that the enemy's propaganda of "no grain collection for three years" and "the imperial army does not harm the common people" is all enemy lies. We can see this from the recent looting and abuses by the enemy in southern Shanxi and the fact that the enemy in Fushan stole more than 200 carts and more than 80 cattle from the villagers in the course of the war. In addition, the conscription of young men in various places and the forced conscription of young men from each village into the city for training are even more hateful.

In order to promote the collapse of the enemy and break the enemy's conspiracy, the compatriots in southeastern Shanxi proposed the action and determination of clearing the fields and emptying the houses. The so-called "empty houses" means that when the enemy attacks, people and goods are moved to a safe place without hesitation and in a planned manner. "Clearing the fields" means thoroughly destroying roads, dismantling castles, and not leaving anything that can be used by the enemy. In the Jinjicha Border Region, as well as Heshun and Liaoxian, the work of "emptying the houses and clearing the fields" has been thoroughly implemented, so that when the enemy arrives, they cannot gain a foothold and receive the supreme effect of controlling the enemy's fate.

3.  Thorough Clearing of Houses and Fields

Under the tense situation in southeastern Shanxi, the counties and districts in southeastern Shanxi, in order to prepare for contingencies, raise war awareness, and intensify mobilization, are all carrying out the work of clearing the houses and fields in order to thoroughly crush the enemy's new offensive. In particular, all the residents' bulky items, such as chests, clothes, food, etc., are moved to the areas designated by the government. The steps of removal are women and food and livestock and the goods of shops in towns and villages and idle furniture. The self-defense teams and the strong laborers act first, and retreat together with various organizations. Food stalls are designated to remain temporarily to meet the needs of the national army. Lighter offenders are released on bail, and heavier offenders are guarded on the spot. The duration of the clearing of houses and fields is determined by the situation and environment. As for wells, mills, and stoves, they are left to be destroyed last.

In order to be serious and orderly, a inspection committee is specially organized, consisting of members from the county government, the Sacrifice League, the Death Squad, the Jinan Working Group, farmers, workers, merchants, youth, women's national salvation associations, and children's teams. They decided that neither government agencies, mass organizations, nor the general public should hesitate or perfunctorily deal with matters. If the covenant is violated, it will be punished. This is a sacred and inviolable covenant. Because of this, the work in each county and district has achieved the intended results. The compatriots in southeastern Shanxi are so determined to prepare to welcome the enemy.

Based on the experience and lessons of the past year, they decided that the work of clearing the houses and fields should be done so that our troops have food, fodder, and water to drink even one minute before the arrival of the enemy. One minute after the enemy arrives, they will not find anything. For these reasons, they organized a transport team to be responsible for the final evacuation of food and the evacuation of wounded soldiers; there is also a demolition team responsible for destroying roads and things that cannot be moved, because the enemy often uses many heavy things to fill them with sand and erect barbed wire to build defensive works.

4.  Setting Up a Net to Eliminate Traitors

In the enemy's new offensive, in addition to military action, it is also accompanied by political conspiracies. From the few traitors we have captured, we have learned a lot about such evil activities. Therefore, in southeastern Shanxi, a widespread campaign to eliminate traitors is now being launched. They organized traitor-elimination teams and set up traitor-elimination nets in preparation for clearing out traitors, because traitors are the vanguard of the enemy, the eyes and ears of the enemy's military offensive. If we want to defeat the enemy, we must first work hard to eliminate traitors.

Southeastern Shanxi is our anti-enemy base area. The results of the year-long activity of being traitors has promoted our achievement of actively eliminating traitors. All parties can understand each other and help each other, so that traitors have no gaps to enter and no time to leave. The people's skills and vigilance in eliminating traitors have become more and more improved. Children have also been organized to perform inspection and sentry duties at the intersections of each village and town, which has further strengthened the difficulty of traitors' activities.

In Gaoping, southeastern Shanxi, some farmers caught several enemy spies last month, and now there are incidents of children catching two armed traitors. The facts are as follows: on the 21st of this month, when the children of Shucun were performing their sentry duties, two men in military uniforms suddenly appeared, wanting to pass through this village and head north. One of the men had a "student" badge. The children saw that they were suspicious and grabbed them, pulling them to the village office for inspection. When the village chief and district chief interrogated them, the traitors even produced guns, almost causing an accident. As a result, a red handkerchief, a bottle of water, and a pistol were found on the body of the traitor from Jinan, and a badge of the puppet maintenance association of Xianshan County and a pass from the puppet maintenance association of Zhangde Prefecture were found on the body of the traitor from Hongdong. Such events are constantly being staged. The children of southeastern Shanxi are weaving the great task of defending southeastern Shanxi under the guidance of adults.

[Reuters, London, 29th] Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky returned from Moscow yesterday to take up his post. This morning, he visited Foreign Secretary Halifax. During their talks, they discussed the Soviet anti-aggression proposals.

[Reuters, London, 30th] The Times' weekly foreign affairs columnist writes that among the matters to be discussed at tomorrow's cabinet meeting will be Foreign Secretary Halifax's report on his recent negotiations with Soviet Ambassador Maisky. It is widely believed that they will discuss the Soviet proposals, namely, the Soviet Union joining Britain and France in guaranteeing Poland and Romania, and providing assistance should Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, or Switzerland be attacked. However, the British and French guarantees must be expanded to include Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. These mutual conditions will all be included in a British-French-Soviet military alliance. It is also learned that the Soviet Union is prepared to first offer guarantees regarding the Far East. It is reported that the British government will strive to draft a compromise plan to meet the demands of the Baltic states.

[Associated Press, London, 30th] During the meeting between the British Foreign Secretary and the Soviet Ambassador, the Soviet Ambassador stated that Britain and France should be responsible for guaranteeing the independence of the southwestern countries bordering the Soviet Union and preventing aggression. The Soviet Union is willing to conclude a detailed military agreement with Britain and France to assist them in resisting attacks from Germany or other countries. Furthermore, the Soviet Union will offer guarantees to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu left here today for Rome, continuing his tour of European capitals. After visiting Rome, Gafencu plans to travel to the capital of Yugoslavia. When commenting on his impressions from visiting Britain and France, Gafencu stated that the determination of Britain and France to maintain peace is truly moving. It is reported that during Gafencu's talks with French authorities, he conducted a thorough review of all Franco-Romanian relations, particularly regarding the issue of maintaining peace in Europe. At the same time, Gafencu and Bonnet were gratified to find that their observations were the same.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 29th] Responsible sources here state that after Hitler's speech, Britain and France have not changed their initial intentions and will continue to actively organize an anti-aggression group. Regarding the matter of Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's visit to France, agreements have been reached on all points discussed, and there will be no revisions due to Hitler's speech. This agreement is beneficial to the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The French side is currently paying close attention to the Polish issue and awaiting Germany's statement of attitude.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 29th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu hosted journalists from various countries this afternoon and gave a speech stating that Romania's current policy is extremely clear and independent. Our country loves peace and will certainly support all efforts to establish peace. I am gratified that all countries I have visited are able to understand our country's position in the international community. The results of this visit to France have been extremely satisfactory. In the evening at 8 o'clock, he and his wife left for Rome.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 29th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu has departed from Paris to come here and will hold talks with Italian authorities. Fascist party members attach great importance to the outcome of the talks, hoping that Romania will join the German-Italian axis, so that its oil production can be controlled by Germany and Italy.

[Reuters, Gibraltar, 29th] Five more French warships arrived today, including the 22,000-ton battleship "Bretagne." Currently, the fleet concentrated in the port of Gibraltar includes three French battleships. At the same time, many British and French warships are also anchored in the vicinity of Gibraltar. The Franco-Spanish border was suddenly closed today for unknown reasons. A group of Spanish refugees was preparing to return to Spain from France, but was forced to turn back due to the border closure.

### Disagreements Among Germany, Italy, and Japan; Military Alliance Difficult to Achieve

[Central News Agency, London, 30th] Regarding the matter of Germany, Italy, and Japan changing the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance, there are disagreements among the three countries. This news was prominently published by London newspapers yesterday. The general opinion is that although Germany is eager to conclude a military alliance, it has not yet succeeded. Hitler's speech the other day did not mention Japan, which is sufficient to prove this. Some newspapers believe that Japan will at most conclude an alliance with Germany to confront the Soviet Union. Well-informed Japanese sources here share the same opinion, stating that Japan can only participate in European wars if it is attacked by the Soviet Union. British officials also share the same opinion as everyone else, that is, there is currently no military alliance among Germany, Italy, and Japan.

### Poland to Give Formal Response to Germany's Memorandum, While Taking Military Preparations to Defend Danzig and the Polish Corridor

[Associated Press, Paris, 30th] The Polish government has recently informed France that it is determined to resist any attempts to seize the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor by force. Hitler's cancellation of the German-Polish Treaty has no effect on Poland. Poland expresses great confidence in its own strength and the spiritual and material assistance of Britain and France.

[United Press, Warsaw, 30th] The Polish President, Foreign Minister, Defense Minister, senior army officers, and cabinet ministers held a meeting yesterday afternoon and decided that current military preparations cannot be relaxed, but they will still seek to maintain good relations with neighboring countries. This decision will be announced by Polish Foreign Minister Beck in the National Assembly next week. At the same time, Poland has resolutely rejected Germany's demands for the return of Danzig and the construction of a road across the border. Furthermore, Poland will reply to Hitler's declaration of the abolition of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact next week. At the same time, the Polish government is making every effort to take military preparations to prevent Hitler's occupation of Danzig. It is reported that the first step in resolving the Polish-German issue awaits the return of the German ambassador to Poland, who left Poland on the 6th of this month and returned to Germany.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 29th] The Polish Foreign Minister will reply to Hitler at the beginning of next week. Polish Foreign Minister Beck will deliver a speech on foreign affairs and formally present a response to Germany's memorandum in Berlin. Hitler's claim that he had proposed concluding a 25-year non-aggression pact and a joint guarantee of Slovakia by Germany, Poland, and is denied here, believing that the purpose of this claim is to sow discord between Britain and Poland. The official attitude towards the Danzig issue and the construction of a highway through the Polish Corridor directly to the Free City of Danzig has not changed. If Hitler's intention was to test Poland's reaction, this move has clearly failed. The Warsaw Culture News states that the impact of Hitler's speech is the cancellation of the national defense bond. The Polish authorities have not yet taken any new national defense measures.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 29th] A certain foreign news agency has rumored that Britain has sent a message to Poland, clarifying that the conclusion of the British-Polish agreement is not intended to encourage Poland to deal with any reasonable German proposals with an attitude that leaves no room for consultation. Polish officials denied this rumor today.

### German-Italian Military Talks; Joint Intimidation of Poland; German Commander-in-Chief Arrives in Rome

[Reuters, Rome, 29th] General Walther von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, accompanied by several generals from his staff, arrived in Rome tonight to prepare for staff talks with Italian military leaders. The Italian cabinet met today, with the Prime Minister reporting on the decision of the Chief of Staff and the Finance Minister on April 7th regarding the allocation of the 10 billion lire special national defense adjustment fund designated last December. According to unconfirmed reports, 5 billion lire of the new adjustment fund has been allocated to adjusting the army's expenses, to be completed within ten years. According to the official mouthpiece, "Gazzetta del Popolo," this massive expense represents another strong response from Italy to the democratic front's policy of encircling Germany and Italy.

[Reuters, London, 29th] Less than 24 hours after Hitler's speech, Germany began a large-scale intimidation campaign against Poland. Nazi newspapers launched a scathing attack, sharply contrasting former Czechoslovak President Beneš with Polish Foreign Minister Beck, questioning whether Beck was willing to suffer the same fate as Beneš. In addition, there was a noteworthy piece of news originating from Berlin and reported by "Agenzia Stefani," stating that German Army Commander-in-Chief General Brauchitsch arrived in Rome today to hold staff meetings with Italian Lieutenant General Pariani. The dispatch contained a warning from Italy to Poland, urging it not to harm Italian-Polish relations and reminding it to pay attention to the fate of Czechoslovakia as "a cautionary tale for those who choose unwise methods to safeguard their untenable positions." The dispatch continued to emphasize the importance of these German-Italian military talks, stating that Brauchitsch's visit to Italy had been arranged long ago, but it would not be surprising if the talks now covered more important issues than originally anticipated, or if this opportunity was used to discuss pressing issues beyond the original agenda. The Warsaw correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" reported that the Axis countries' intimidation of Poland had only led Poland to call up more reserve personnel and to strengthen Polish-Soviet relations. The ideological discord between Poland and the Soviet Union had disappeared as a result of Hitler's attack, and Anglo-Soviet negotiations would proceed smoothly. Poland was not concerned about Germany's announcement of the abrogation of the non-aggression pact, as Hitler would have abandoned the treaty sooner or later if it were not useful to Germany. According to Italian official sources, Italy is currently stepping up the training of its air force, and all air force reserves and aviation personnel who have not received previous training are being called up for training starting June 1st for a period of two months. As for expanding substantive military mobilization, officials said that a decision had also been made.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 30th] German newspapers today again heavily publicized that German residents within Poland were being attacked by Poles, indicating that relations between Germany and Poland are becoming increasingly tense. Yesterday, Hitler held talks with Ribbentrop and met with the Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in the evening. Officials said that "Roosevelt has been won over by Hitler."

[Reuters, Berlin, 29th] It is reported that Hitler will definitely not discuss diplomatic issues in his Labor Day speech. German newspapers tonight have taken a tougher stance on Poland and are also carefully studying foreign criticisms of Hitler's speech. The German side considers most criticisms to be unreasonable and stubborn.

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 30th] Political circles here believe that the Italian government's decision to expand its military is a response to Chamberlain's announcement of the implementation of conscription. Political figures also pointed out that Mussolini met with the Army Chief of Staff and the Finance Minister on the 26th (the day after Chamberlain announced conscription).

### Hitler Receives Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister; Discussion of Issues Related to the Two Countries

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th] Hitler received Hungarian Prime Minister Imrédy and Foreign Minister Csáky at 4:30 this afternoon for a long discussion. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. Afterwards, the German News Agency issued a statement saying that various issues of concern to both parties had been openly discussed, and the friendly relations between the two countries and their shared views on the international political situation had been clearly demonstrated. Imrédy and Csáky will also visit Göring and other important figures.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th] Hitler received the Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister yesterday. Last night, an official detailed announcement was made stating that Hitler received the two Hungarian politicians at the Chancellery and held a long conversation. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, the Hungarian Ambassador to Germany, and the German Ambassador to Hungary were also present. When the two Hungarian politicians arrived, they first inspected the guard of honor. Their discussions with Germany all pertained to issues related to the two countries, and later a friendship agreement was established.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th] Hitler hosted a banquet at the Chancellery last night to entertain the Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Guests included the Governor-General of Romania and his wife, the Hungarian Ambassador to Germany, General Göring, and other important figures from the German government and the National Socialist Party.

### German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, Presents Credentials

Before leaving, he told the press that President Roosevelt's telegram of the 15th was a courageous move. He believed that war was inevitable, and the key to whether the current problems could be resolved lies solely with Hitler in Germany. However, no one can predict what Hitler intends to do in the future.

The author of the article, Dr. Urbeţia, holds a very critical view of Japan's current position.

A. J. Bergeson also spoke, saying that if America's rich wealth could be directed towards peaceful countries, they would surely prevail. Senator Johnson, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that designating a country as an aggressor and implementing sanctions is tantamount to "war."

After recounting the causes of the previous World War, Biddelman said that America's participation in the European War was forced by neutral conduct.

Short Commentary

### Today's Topic

What day is today? May 1st. The great International Labor Day. The labor world around the world is warmly celebrating today. The domestic labor world in China is also very enthusiastic.

Only Japan is an exception. Since the "September 18th" Incident, while superficially upholding world peace, they have announced the abolition of Labor Day. We must overthrow Japanese imperialism. Speaking of Labor Day, some people seem to dislike it a bit, but the situation today is different. First, the Soviet Union, the protector of the labor world, has become a cornerstone in maintaining world peace; second, capitalist countries such as Britain, France, and the United States are negotiating to cooperate with the Soviet Union, a country of labor; third, the main task of workers around the world today is to fight against fascism and aggression.

Speaking of China, the only task of the labor world today is to support the war of resistance and national construction, and to oppose fascist aggression. Because only in this way can there be a real way out.

Domestically, the call to improve people's livelihoods is growing louder as the war of resistance progresses. We believe that action is better than empty words. What is action? First, workers must enthusiastically participate in production and strive to increase production; second, government and community leaders must encourage labor and unemployed workers to participate in production, or ensure that they can automatically and actively improve production efficiency!

However, an even more urgent prerequisite is to make workers literate, to educate workers, and to eliminate labor illiteracy. This is the fundamental way to avoid all unnecessary disputes.

The gunfire of Japanese aggressors has forced many factories in China to relocate to this port. We admire the spirit of hard struggle of these factory authorities. We want to cooperate sincerely with the spirit of shared hardship. At the same time, in order to avoid unnecessary waste, it is best to strive to promote labor education and current affairs speeches, so that we can understand the difficulties of the times. Only with cooperation can there be a way out.

Today's telegrams to the UK are free of charge. Thank you for this good example. Quickly send a telegram to congratulate Mr. Attlee, a member of the Labour Party in the British House of Commons! He recently called for "unity against fascism and aggression," which is very helpful to the world and to China!

### Britain Actively Prepares for War; Divides the Country into Seven Regions for Food Supply in Wartime; Large-Scale Conscription to be Discussed in the House of Commons; Anglo-German Relations Under Review

[Associated Press, London, 30th] The British government is currently carefully studying the parts of Hitler's speech that involve Britain in order to examine whether Anglo-German relations can be improved. It is reported that Britain may ask Hitler to explain his speech. Also, Britain's military expansion is underway, and the issue of large-scale conscription will be discussed in the House of Commons on Thursday.

[Central News Agency, London, 29th] Following the government's decision to implement conscription, the Army High Command held a meeting at 11 a.m. this morning to discuss the implementation methods. Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha presided over the meeting, which lasted until 6 p.m. Those present did not have lunch but ate sandwiches and drank beer at the meeting place. This shows the importance of what was discussed. [Reuters, London, 29th] According to Reuters diplomatic correspondents, although Britain is prepared to respond to Germany's note abrogating the Anglo-German naval agreement at an appropriate time, the British government's current attitude shows no intention of agreeing to the suggestion that the two countries should hold a conference to discuss naval issues.

[Reuters, London, 29th] The British government recently announced the division of the entire country into seven regions, each with a committee for the management of livestock and grain. This move is a further measure to prepare for maintaining food supplies in wartime.

[Reuters, London, 29th] In the first three weeks of April, 40,000 people signed up to join the Territorial Army. This number is higher than the entire year of 1936, which was considered a boom year for military recruitment at the time. Among those who signed up this year, there were even those over the age of twenty-one. According to the conscription law, these personnel are not among those to be drafted.

[Reuters, London, 29th] Concerns about the implementation of conscription in Northern Ireland and the issue of the legal status of Irish people in Britain after the implementation of conscription are one of the main reasons for de Valera's sudden postponement of his trip to the United States. However, according to news agency reports, these concerns will soon be eliminated, as the British government is eager to avoid any actions that could harm Anglo-Irish relations. Therefore, the issue of extending conscription in Northern Ireland has been definitively postponed. At the same time, regarding the issue of Irish residents in Britain, the authorities have also stipulated that only those born and registered in Britain can participate in military service.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 29th] The British standing army will supplement the Second Armored Division to enhance its strength. According to a morning report in the "News Chronicle," the supplemented new division will be an independent organization and will not be related to the recently announced conscription system. The report also recalled that Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha stated to the House of Commons in March when submitting the army budget that he intended to add a large number of heavy tanks to enhance the strength of the standing army.

### The Air Defense Bureau Will Intensify Air Defense Training in the Middle of This Month; Conduct Wartime Air Defense Exercises; Implement Emergency Lighting Controls at Any Time; Shelters Will Be Set Up in the City Center

Air defense matters in Hong Kong are now reaching a fever pitch. All kinds of equipment are making great progress. Previous lighting control exercises were all ordinary practice and the results could not be considered good. According to reliable news obtained by the reporter from the air defense authorities, the Air Defense Committee has decided to hold a wartime air defense exercise sometime in May. This exercise has a dual meaning. On the one hand, it allows residents to familiarize themselves with the sound of the alarm; on the other hand, it tests the speed and efficiency of lighting control. The exercise will occur on a certain day in the middle of this month, but the exact date will not be announced to the public. At that time, residents will only be given a hint, so that the alarm is issued from the bottom of the people's hearts. The alarm will first sound the air raid alarm, and finally the all-clear. The air defense authorities have decided that in the event of an air raid, pedestrians in the city center who do not have time to go home or return to their offices can obtain full protection in the city center shelters. These public shelter locations in the city center have been designated by Air Defense Commissioner Spurr as several government buildings. In case of emergency, these buildings will be reinforced to increase their resistance and add sandbags. Some open spaces have also been designated by the air defense authorities for the construction of air raid shelters when necessary. As for the Kowloon mainland, buildings have also been designated for public shelters. Each well in the area has been designated to be used to put out fires if water pipes are destroyed and a fire occurs at the same time, but absolutely not to be used as drinking water for residents. Regarding the issue of ensuring the safety of drinking water in Hong Kong, the authorities have already made a decision, but this plan is completely unrelated to the selected wells. In addition, the Air Defense Committee recently sent letters to various businesses, requesting that they select one or two employees to participate in various air defense training lecture classes. More than 180 replies have been received. These training lecture classes will begin at 5:30 p.m. on May 12th and will be held every Tuesday and Friday at 5:30 p.m. until the twelve lessons are completed. The responsible instructors are Air Defense Commissioner Spurr, Dunley, Fubar, and Neilson. The purpose of the training is to enable employees of various businesses to have sufficient air defense knowledge to plan the air defense design of their own businesses, be responsible for training various air defense personnel, and serve as liaison officers on the Air Defense Committee.

### Chinese Merchants Raise 300,000 to Open a Match Factory; Factory Site at Ma Tau Kok; Construction Work During the Day

Matches are consumed in large quantities every day. In the past, matches from Sweden and Japan were widely sold in the Hong Kong and mainland markets. Recently, Chinese at home and abroad have tended to use domestic goods. Therefore, the business of domestic match factories has gradually flourished.

### Fundraising for Domestic Cultural Undertakings; Famous Play "A Year" to be Jointly Performed; Hong Kong Theater People Held Their First Performance Committee Meeting Yesterday; Decided to Officially Perform in Late May

### Siam Adds New Taxes Again; Local Cloth Sales to Siam Hit Hard; New Tax Rate Several Times Higher Than Before; Other Local Goods Also Greatly Affected

Hong Kong's weaving industry has developed extremely rapidly in recent years, with many factories standing tall and their products sold far and wide around the world. Among them, sales in Southeast Asia are the largest. Only after last autumn did they begin to shrink. Among the sales of Hong Kong local textiles in Southeast Asia, Siam accounts for a large number. In the past, several million yuan worth of various fabrics were shipped from Hong Kong to that country every year. Not only were they popular with the local Chinese, but also many Siamese purchased them. Therefore, the sales of Hong Kong local textiles in that area increased year by year. However, since the Lunar New Year this year, the Siamese government has implemented new regulations, uniformly increasing taxes on the import of Chinese goods, especially for fabrics. For example, those that were previously taxed at 5% are now taxed at around 20%, several times higher than before. Therefore, import and export firms have stopped shipping goods one after another, and many of those ordered before the Lunar New Year have also been cancelled. Under these circumstances, Hong Kong's local textile market in Siam has shrunk day by day, almost disappearing. Therefore, at present, the local textiles shipped from Hong Kong to Southeast Asia are only to the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines. It is reported that the sales of other local goods to Siam have also decreased due to the high tariff barriers.

### Free Telegrams Can be Sent Today; But Only for Social Telegrams

The people of Hong Kong can enjoy preferential rights, but each telegram is limited to twelve characters and must be purely social in nature. The newly revised social telegram fee of the company is four yuan for each telegram with twelve characters, and an additional 33 cents are charged for each additional character.

### Sharp Increase in Hong Kong Population; Cholera Prevention Campaign Advanced; Free Vaccinations as Last Year; Inspection of Ships Arriving from Infected Ports

Each summer, Hong Kong tends to experience cholera epidemics, with a significant number of residents dying from it each year. Aware of the substantial increase in Hong Kong's population density this year, and fearing that a cholera outbreak would lead to severe mortality and unimaginable consequences, health authorities have advanced the cholera prevention campaign. Yesterday, Director of Medical Services, Dr. Selwyn Clarke, shared his views with reporters, stating that the previous year's cholera prevention campaign was very successful, with 940,000 people receiving cholera vaccinations. Consequently, only 547 cases of the disease occurred last year, with only 349 deaths, a reduction of more than half compared to the 1,401 cases and 776 deaths in 1937. He hoped that Hong Kong residents would continue to cooperate as they did last year, so the disease would not be a major concern. This year's campaign has been brought forward and will commence in a day or two. All measures will follow last year's, with free vaccinations provided at public clinics and hospitals. Patients infected with the disease will be isolated in infectious disease hospitals to prevent its spread. Propaganda posters and leaflets will be posted on walls and lampposts along main roads to urge residents to pay attention and get vaccinated promptly. The sale of unsanitary food will also be prohibited. Ships arriving from ports declared as infected must undergo maritime inspection. Passengers without cholera vaccinations will not be allowed to disembark in Hong Kong. When a case of the disease occurs in a building, in addition to sending the patient to the hospital, the building must be disinfected. Regarding cholera vaccinations, the Director of Medical Services also hoped that residents would voluntarily seek vaccinations from private doctors at their own expense to avoid overcrowding at public hospitals.

### The Passion and Power of Laborers: Printing Workers Raise Funds for Children's Art Exhibition; Electrical Workers Hold National Covenant Oath Ceremony

— Qi Zhuo

Consider reporting on these two passionate and powerful events as a gift to commemorate the sacred Labor Day.

Yesterday at 9 a.m., the Chinese Bookstore Choir of the Third Special Branch of the Hong Kong Printing Workers' Union held a grand art exhibition at the Dongle Theatre to raise funds for the Children's Welfare Association.

Nearly a thousand people upstairs and downstairs filled the venue with noise.

The faces of the workers, etched with the marks of wind, frost, and toil, looked as innocent and lovely as the young because they were wearing glorious and vibrant work clothes. Glorious work clothes are gradually becoming a uniform loved by more people.

After the chairman announced the reasons for the meeting, Mr. Wang Xiaoying spoke sincerely on behalf of the Children's Welfare Association: "...Most of what I'm hearing today is Shanghainese, which fills me with emotion. Shanghai, my second hometown where I lived for ten years, I hope everyone will work together to fight back!"

—Who would forget their hometown? The atmosphere in the venue turned solemn.

"The three Hong Kong Children's Welfare Homes have taken in a total of 400 refugee children, most of whom come from Wuhan, except for a few who have stayed in [ ]. Although the Welfare Homes have sent letters to their families, a staggering 70-80% have been returned. One can only imagine the fate of their parents and families under [ ] [ ]. These orphans and refugee children [ ], we are very grateful for your enthusiastic fundraising and generous assistance. Refugee children who are hungry and wandering on the front lines are still waiting for us to rescue them! Let us cherish our next generation."

A burst of warm applause sent the compassionate Ms. Wang off the stage, followed by another round of enthusiastic applause as the prelude to the art performance.

After the singing and harmonica ensemble, the one-act national defense play "Defection" opened.

Northeast puppet troops awakened in a life of slavery. The passion of the vast number of brothers finally transformed the officers who "obeyed [ ] orders" into [ ] pioneers who "obeyed the motherland" and "obeyed the truth." "Roar!" The tide of "defection" finally drove the [ ] people out of the territory, and they all returned to their old homes in the Northeast. The living reality in the Northeast and North China was fully presented on stage.

The following national defense Peking opera "The Great Battle of Donglin Temple" suited the tastes of many outsiders. The sound of gongs and drums, the stylized movements of Peking opera, and the majestic voices allowed people to relive old dreams and feel a deeper affection for their beloved motherland. The play included [ ] hanging at the graves of soldiers who died in the war of resistance, and the壮烈of our army's defeat of [ ] [ ], truly a successful example of "new wine in old bottles." The enthusiastic atmosphere in the audience inspired us that in addition to promoting spoken drama, we must also supplement it with improved traditional opera to achieve greater results.

The association's charity performance raised approximately HK$600, all of which will be used to support the Children's Welfare Home. The expenses for this conference were covered by 59 enthusiastic members of the association, who contributed five, three, and one dollar each. Contributing both effort and money, they are truly generous and straightforward typical workers.

After the meeting, the reporter rushed to the Confucius Hall to participate in the National Covenant Oath Ceremony of the Chinese Workers' Recreation Club of the Hong Kong Electric Company. A large group are "manufacturers" of "spiritual food," and a large group are "controllers" of "light"; both types of laborers are equally sacred! Who says that society is not created by laborers?

The Hong Kong Electric Company has more than 600 Chinese workers, and the association has been established for nine years. In order not to forget the motherland and not to forget the responsibility on their shoulders, they held the National Covenant Oath Ceremony.

At 1 p.m., the solemn ceremony began. When observing a moment of silence for the soldiers who died on the front lines and the compatriots who lost their lives, Ms. Chen Zhijian sang a mournful requiem, and the entire audience was silent. Even the most insensitive person could not help but be moved.

The chairman was Mr. Li Fenghang, the chairman of the association. When announcing the reasons for the meeting, he was calm, sincere, and revealed the original demeanor of a labor leader. After reading the National Covenant publicly, Mr. Li Jianfeng, the editor-in-chief of the Industrial and Commercial Daily, presided over the oath and gave a speech.

Mr. Lin Shu, the head of the First Regiment of the Guangxi Student Army, and Mr. Lu Fu, a member of the Standing Committee of the All-Circles Relief Association, also arrived. The chairman was very happy to invite them to speak.

Mr. Lu first explained that workers are the main force in the national revolutionary struggle and the class that has contributed the most to the war of resistance. He then reiterated that today's oath must be aligned with the objective environment of Hong Kong.

First, we must strive for international sympathy through self-reliance; second, we must mobilize the vast power of overseas Chinese to support [ ] and assist in national reconstruction. Following that, Lin Shengxian cited the Shanghai carter A Mao in the January 28th Incident and an old boatman in Wuhan who deliberately drowned the [ ] people and military supplies he was carrying to achieve a great price at the expense of his own life, proving the greatness of the workers' power. No matter where or what kind of person, everyone has the opportunity to participate in [ ] [ ] [ ] and be loyal to the country. Deeply moving to the workers.

The Changhong Choir sang 11 songs of national salvation in succession, and the male and female duets deeply touched people's hearts.

The Youth Association Comics Society performed the drama "After the Fall," which was very successful. Liu Yiming, the director of the drama, and the actors Lin Ciming, Luo Liang, Li Yanfang, Chen Gui, Zheng Bingji, Lu Shan, Ma Yifei, and Liu Yao were all enthusiastic workers who loved drama. The Hong Kong Electric Company's after-work drama troupe performed the drama "Withdrawal," and the atmosphere at the venue remained tense.

After that, the association's national arts class held its opening ceremony, with national arts performances and lion dances, which lasted until 5 p.m. The sale of flowers at the venue raised HK$21.95, which was donated to the Children's Welfare Home and accepted and thanked by the representatives of the home.

Our workers have passion and power. They are a group of hardworking people.

They are the supporters of today's society and the creators of tomorrow's society. We mental laborers respectfully extend our most sincere salute for national liberation to the vast number of workers!

### Sketch of a Dartboard: Special Report

In a narrow shop in the front half of a building, a white cloth with the words "Dartboard Grand Prizes" is hung at the entrance. "Dartboard" is a term often seen in old-fashioned martial arts novels, but now it has become a public gambling tool. The structure of this gambling device is very simple: a round piece of wood as big as a finger and about three inches long, with three or so hollow [ ] feathers or duck feathers attached to the tail, and a thick [ ] tube about one inch long inserted into the head. That's the dart. The method of throwing the dart is also easy. On the wall about five or six feet away, a wooden board is inlaid. The board is painted with small squares of five colors: red, yellow, blue, white, and black. If you are a gambler, if you choose a certain color, you throw the dart at the square of that color. If you are lucky and your technique is skillful, and you hit the target with one throw, you bet two copper coins, and you get a "Red Golden Dragon" cigarette worth one dime, including the principal and interest. If you don't want the cigarette, they can give you nine copper coins, which is a 10% discount on the price of a "Red Golden Dragon."

It is said that this kind of gambling is very fair. Anyone can pick up a "dart" and throw it (of course, you must have at least two copper coins to bet), so there is absolutely no cheating. However, if you repeatedly fail to hit the target, you should blame your fate and lament your bad luck. If you try to stand in front of the prize distribution point, you will hear someone talking loudly about someone who won fifty or sixty dollars here yesterday, and someone else who quickly hit the target several times an hour ago and won more than a hundred dollars. On the other side, you will hear someone saying, "'Young man,' you lost again, don't buy red, buy white." And to a maid servant, he said, "If you bet a few more times, you can easily win back. You only lost a dozen dollars, why would you give up so easily? Take a puff of cigarette, take a breath, and then go back." With such words, the front of the booth is crowded, and the business seems to be not bad. However, the world is the world of people. If your business is really good, someone will come to ask you to share the profits. So, there are people who take advantage of others' influence to settle accounts with you. A man dressed in short clothes squeezed up to see the scene and said intentionally or unintentionally, "Business is very good, you are really making a lot of money." But they shook their heads and said, "In the past, 'giving money' was only twenty dollars a day, but now it costs forty or fifty dollars more, plus rent and the wages of partners and other things. We have to earn eighty or ninety dollars a day to avoid losing money, but how can we earn eighty or ninety dollars every day? Not collecting protection money is already lucky, you still say we are making a lot of money." The man in short clothes did not say a word, took the five-dollar bill they gave him and picked up a pack of free Red Golden Dragon, took out a cigarette and burned it, and strode out.

Even though it is said that not collecting protection money is already lucky, there are still many people continuing to open businesses. Not counting those facing the sea, there are already seventy or eighty "Dartboard Grand Prize" locations in Central, Sheung Wan, Eastern District, and Western District. I heard that the people who collect "money distribution" are now thinking of adding one-third to the amount. This is of course taking wool from the sheep. Regarding this point, it has not been told to the readers that the dartboard is a profitable business, but if you are not afraid of taking turns paying, then this place is a safe place for gamblers. Because there is a grand prize as a amulet for non-illegal gambling, and there is also protection money for "distributing money," there is absolutely no risk of failure.

### X Troops Stirring in Sanshui; Our Guerrillas in Nansan Counties Rise Up; We Are on High Alert and Disrupting the X Troops' Rear; Our Detachment in the Lower West River Attacked Guanshan at Night

[West River Express] Recently, there has been an increase in X troops in the Sanshui area of the West River. We are on high alert and have ordered the guerrillas in Nanhai and Sanshui counties to launch a full-scale operation with a keen attitude in order to disrupt the rear of the X troops and contain the X troops on the front lines. After the guerrillas in the two counties carried out their operations, they have repeatedly struck the X troops and assisted the regular army in their combat power. On the 27th and 28th, the guerrillas of Sanshui and Nanhai joined forces to annihilate the X troops. The details are recorded below.

X Troops Stirring in Sanshui

According to a telegram from the front, the X troops entrenched in Sanshui have recently continued to increase. On the 24th, 25th and 26th, the X troops' vehicles traveled frequently along the Guangsan Railway. In addition to a part reinforcing the Jiujiang Heqing Erlong area of the Jiangfo Line, another part was heading to the Sanshui front line. In recent days, a large number of X military weapons and ammunition have arrived at the front line and stored in Sanshui city and the X camp in Hekou Southwest Ganggen. Recently, 60 or 70 X speedboats and electric boats have also sailed to the river surface near Jiaokou Sixianjiao. On the 25th and 26th, the X speedboats carried a small number of X soldiers and patrolled and peered, looking at the old Sanshui Qingqi coast with binoculars, with a very active appearance. Upon receiving the report, Deng Longguang, the former commander of the West Line Front X, ordered the front-line guards to be on high alert and monitor, and to seize the opportunity to attack. In addition, a certain elite artillery unit was dispatched to reinforce the strongholds of Ma Fang Hantang Qingqi Jinli on the front line and set up strong artillery positions to prevent X from forcibly crossing the West River and invading.

Guerrillas Destroy Guangsan Road

The Chen detachment of the guerrillas lurking in the eastern district of Sanshui recently received orders from the Western Military Authority to actively operate. It was learned a few days ago that the Guangsan Railway was busy with X transportation, day and night. On the 26th, they sneaked to the vicinity of Shangjiao and joined the Wu Qin detachment of the Nanhai County guerrillas. On the night of the 27th, they secretly went to the Xiaotang Station of the Guangsan Railway, [ ] the tracks there, destroyed more than ten feet of roadbed, and secretly laid landmines. On the dawn of the 28th, an X military vehicle opened from Foshan to Sanshui. When it arrived near Luocun, it was learned by a traitor that there was a change in the future and reported to the X military. The car stopped moving and dispatched a team of engineers to repair it. Unexpectedly, just starting work, they mistakenly triggered a landmine pre-laid by the guerrillas, and with a loud bang, it exploded on the spot. The X soldiers were caught off guard and were killed or injured in the process, with blood and flesh flying everywhere. Later, another team of X and X soldiers was dispatched from Foshan to continue the repair, and the traffic was restored in the afternoon. As for our guerrillas, they will continue their efforts to inflict the greatest damage on the road.

Gan Sanqiu Detachment Attacks Guanshan at Night

The Gan Sanzhu detachment of the guerrillas operating between Xiqiao in the lower reaches of the West River has repeatedly annihilated the X army. According to recent reports, more than 100 X soldiers arrived and stationed in Guanshan. On the 8th, a team was sent to Minle City. On the evening of that day, they met with local people and disguised themselves to sneak into Guanshan Market. Another team was at the foot of Xiqiao Mountain. At about 10 p.m., the team members hiding in the market set off a fire as a signal and rushed to the X camp entrenched in the silkworm experiment area in separate ways. They first threw hand grenades at the camp, and the X army was trapped on all sides and could not break through. They tightly clenched the door and fired machine guns outwards indiscriminately to prevent our guerrillas from rushing in. After about twenty minutes of contention, the X who were stationed on the sea surface rushed to rescue. Our guerrillas began to retreat to a certain place. In this night attack, more than 20 X soldiers were annihilated by us.

### X Army Repelled from Longyan Green Gorge; No Trace of X in Hecheng; Sanbu Relieved and Ferry Service Resumes

[West River Express] The Hecheng battle: since our reinforcements arrived on the 28th and launched a fierce counterattack, after our army's courageous and bloody battle, the X army was finally repelled on the morning of the 9th and 700 to 800 people were annihilated. The details are recorded below.

No Trace of X in Heshan County

In the Heshan battle, our army abandoned the Gulao and Gubao positions on the 27th and lured X to go deeper. X took advantage of the situation to increase the number of soldiers, and a total of more than 3,000 infantry and artillery soldiers under the protection of highly mechanized [ ] launched a fierce attack on Heshan County. Dozens of X aircraft were dispatched to run around, frantically bombing the Xinhu and Heshan border areas. On the 28th, the X were forced into the Huikeng Longmian community and other areas. The two sides fought for the heights and strongholds on the outskirts of the city, melee combat, and launched assaults dozens of times. X was still unable to advance an inch. At 2 p.m., 300 to 400 people were reinforced from Heqing and crossed the river to plot to attack our left wing of Heshan. Fortunately, at this time, our reinforcements also rushed from Gaoming Sanzhou. [ ] then defeated X in one fell swoop. Another unit copied Kunlun Mountain and joined our army moving to the west of the city, and counterattacked X at night. By the morning of the 29th, the X army attacking the city was finally repelled. There is now no trace of X in Heshan County. In this bloody battle that lasted day and night, a total of 500 to 600 X troops were annihilated.

X Defeated at Green Gorge

The X attacking Zhu Green Gorge on the north side of Hecheng was greeted by the 64th Army, which guarded the north side of the city, and the Heshan team to launch a head-on attack. The first to rush in was the cavalry. Our military team, regardless of everything, fought from the 27th to 2 p.m. on the 8th. X cavalry repeatedly advanced and failed. After many interceptions by our team, the X cavalry was annihilated. More than 300 people were destroyed, and more than 30 war horses were captured. X corpses were everywhere, but after the disastrous defeat, they fled to Gulao. It was also found that the X in Jianghui attacked Daze on the 27th. On the 28th, they attacked Du Ruan Jinggen and Pingdiling in separate ways along the Xinkai Jiangfo roads. However, in these two areas, our guards adopted a steady strategy and tried their best to hold on to the positions, so the X army's several advances were repelled. Because of this, the X and our armies are still in a stalemate in Du Ruan Pingdi. At 2 p.m. on the 28th, more than 10 X aircraft flew to Siqian Daze and dropped 60 to 70 bombs fiercely. The Daze and Xiaoze markets were almost bombed into scorched earth, and the losses were heavy. Fortunately, most of the people [ ] had already evacuated early, and the casualties were relatively small. In addition, after the X attacking Danshuikou and Gongyi were defeated by our reinforcements, as of the 28th, except for two X motorboats still patrolling the Yinhu Sanjiang sea, there was no trace of X in Danshuikou and Gongyi. Sanbu, Changsha, Xinchang, and Dihai have become more relaxed. It was found that the Deji and Hengji ferries, which traveled between Siyi Sanbu and Macau, have resumed direct access from Aoqianshan to Xinchang Sanbu since the 28th. The Fu'an ferry, which originally traveled to Rongqi Macau, has also been changed to Macau Sanbu and directly to Xinchang since yesterday. Sanbu traffic was then restored.

### Norwegian Merchant Ship Detained; Shantou Merchants Suffer Huge Losses; All Hope Norway Argues on Just Grounds

[Shantou Express] The Norwegian merchant ship Gong Sheng, which was en route from Shanghai to Shantou via Fujian, was unreasonably detained by X warships near the Fujian Sea. It has been many days since then and has not been released. It was found that the ship carried many goods purchased by Shantou merchants. According to the Chamber of Commerce, the goods occupied by Shantou merchants on this trip to Shantou included more than 60,000 catties of soybean cake, more than 10,000 bags of wheat flour, and about 100 pieces of cotton yarn. In addition, there were medicinal materials and groceries. The total value of all goods was about 400,000 yuan. Shantou merchants first remit money to foreign ports and then deliver the goods, so the loss of Shantou merchants is very huge this time. I hope the Norwegian authorities will argue on just grounds and not allow the X army to use this robbery method.

### Officials in Huiyang Tour Together

[Huiyang Express] Since the recovery of Huiyang, Liu Binggang, the magistrate of Huiyang County, He Zehong, the secretary-general of the county party headquarters, and Yang Xingmin, the deputy commander of the National Self-Defense Corps, have been planning all aspects of party, government, and military work in the county. Now, in order to understand the recent working conditions of the party, government, and military in the county and improve the wartime working efficiency, they have jointly toured all the districts under their jurisdiction for inspection. On the 26th, they patrolled and arrived at Danshui Market in the Second District. On the 27th, they transferred from Danshui to Pingshan Renshan and other districts.

### Shantou Continues to Intensify Evacuation of Population and Materials; Authorities Implement Mandatory Removal of Children; Otherwise, They Will Be Sent to Children's Welfare Homes for Accommodation

[Shantou Express] The situation in Chaoshan has become increasingly tense recently. Although the deadline for evacuating the population and relocating materials has expired, there are still many who have not been able to relocate, so it is still being intensified. The evacuation of children is the most urgent task at present. In order to avoid children staying in dangerous areas, the authorities have decided to strictly enforce it. Yesterday, they specifically ordered the police stations in each district to be responsible for investigating the number of children who have not been evacuated in their jurisdiction in order to force them to leave the country separately. If their parents and relatives will not leave the country due to other relationships, they must also send their minor children to the Children's Welfare Association for accommodation to ensure safety. As for those who have not relocated materials and factories within the time limit, they are also ordered to report to the branch for investigation and verification, and the government will dismantle and manage them by itself. Since the X aircraft invaded Shantou three times on the 27th, most of the elderly, weak, women, and children have left Shantou. The Chaoshan electric boat capacity is extremely crowded. When the military and political authorities in Chaoshan discussed the methods of evacuating "people" and "things," they had a proposal to urge the people to organize wartime public refugee cooperation groups. Later, methods for organizing cooperative groups were drafted and announced. However, when the city evacuated the population this time, the general public was not very clear about this type of organization method, and there was no such organization. Zhang Jiabin, the director of the city's police station, specially ordered the staff of the bureau to organize a family group to drink to set an example for the citizens, and organized the evacuated group in accordance with the methods of the cooperative group. There are sound methods for the supply of medicines and the management of group living. The group has been evacuated to a safe area in the interior a few days ago. A total of more than 50 families participated and lived in one place, and the management was excellent.

### Party Members in the War Zone Losing Documents - Special Remedial Measures - Three Measures Specifically Established

[Shaoguan Express] The Provincial Party is handling the general registration of party members and probationary party members from various counties. Various counties have complied with orders and completed their reports to the headquarters. It is now reported that party members from various counties in the war zone have lost their party membership documents due to the incidents, making it impossible to register in accordance with regulations. Three remedial measures have been specially formulated and distributed to the party headquarters in various counties in the war zone to be handled in a timely manner. The measures are recorded as follows: (1) If a party member loses their document, they may request a certificate from the district work committee or the county party headquarters (the party certificate or registration number issued by the Central Executive Committee or the Southwest Executive Department must be cancelled); (2) Those holding membership certificates of the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance, Kuomintang membership certificates (Kuomintang before the third year of the Republic), or those who obtained party membership qualifications after the thirteenth year and before the seventeenth year of the Republic, and have party membership certificates or other supporting evidence sufficient to prove it, are eligible for the special endorsement registration regulations. Those who obtained party membership qualifications after the seventeenth year of the Republic and hold party membership certificates or registration certificates, etc., should be handled in accordance with the general registration method; (3) Party dues owed by party members before registration will be waived. However, after registration, they must be collected in accordance with regulations.

### Li Wuzi Wanted - Soldiers Who Retreat in the Face of Battle

During the recent invasion of Xinhui by the × people, we mounted a strong resistance and fought fiercely for six days and nights, inflicting heavy casualties and significantly depleting the × people's strength. Subsequently, after obtaining considerable compensation, our side safely withdrew from the outskirts of Huicheng and firmly defended Fen Shui, Jiang Du Ruan, and other places. We have continued to resist and counterattack in recent days. It has been found that during this fierce battle, the soldiers fought valiantly and heroically. However, a small number of them deserted temporarily. They have now been dismissed, wanted, and investigated by Commander Li Wuzi of the Fifth Guerrilla Column. It has been found that there are seven officers among those wanted.

### Quiet on the Northern Guangdong Battlefield - Our × Forces Are Busy Deploying - Small Skirmishes on the Front Lines in Recent Days - The × Dare Not Disturb the Shengang Area

[Northern Guangdong Express] The war in northern Guangdong has been relatively quiet recently because our × forces are busy with offensive and defensive deployments. The × fear being surrounded and annihilated by us, so they are actively reinforcing and on guard. However, due to continuous surprise attacks by our troops, they have suffered heavy losses, and their morale is low. They have been lying dormant in one corner in recent days, daring not to move. Therefore, there have only been small skirmishes on the front lines. The military situation is as follows:

West of Shengang - No Trace of the ×

Since our army captured Zhenhua, it has been attacking Shengang step by step. On the evening of the 24th, Liang's division attacked Shengang at night, annihilating dozens of ×. The × were quite panicked. Furthermore, due to the continuous heavy blows by our army in recent months, they have suffered more than half of their casualties, and their strength is extremely weak. Therefore, they have shortened the offensive lines around them and fortified their camps. It has been found that in the past, × infantry and cavalry often infiltrated and harassed the areas of Mumian Cliff, Jiu Lian Tomb, Maya Village, etc., west of Shengang, looting food. Recently, our army has deployed strong defensive lines in the area of Aotou Shiziqian, strictly controlling the ×. Therefore, they dare not send teams to disturb them. The above-mentioned areas are as peaceful as usual. Furthermore, on the 6th, some of the ×'s grain, supplies, and military goods in Shengang retreated towards Taipingchang. The intention is unclear.

Attack on Pingshan - Remnants of the × Annihilated

Furthermore, Wang's regiment of a certain division of our army in Huaxian has been pressing south along the Guanghua Line towards Xilong Pingshan in recent days. The × troops guarding this area are the remnants of the "Fujii" and "Watanabe" units. Fearing our attack, they come and go不定. On the 24th and 25th, more than 200 × infantry and cavalry, accompanied by a artillery platoon, infiltrated Pingshan. Our assault team then launched a surprise attack on the × late at night on the 26th, encircling and annihilating the × in several routes. The × troops resisted stubbornly, relying on the dangerous terrain, but their strength gradually waned. Subsequently, the × troops from Longkou Village heard the news and rushed to reinforce them in armored vehicles. A certain battalion of our fresh troops also joined the battle at this time. The battle was fierce. Our army bravely charged and stepped into the × formation. The × troops were defeated in a panic and retreated into the market town, where they were trapped. More than 20 were killed, and more than ten long and short guns and several war horses were captured. Our army did not withdraw to its original position until dawn.

Advance on Tanbu - The × Army Collapses in Defeat

Furthermore, it has been found that along the Chantan Line on the left wing of the northern route, our army has also made progress in recent weeks. Li's division of the Twelfth Army Group pressed towards Tanbu from the direction of Chibaini. Only about a hundred × troops were stationed in this area. On the morning of the 27th, our artillery first launched an attack on the × troops, firing continuously fifty or sixty shells. Many of the shells hit their target, destroying the × fortifications. A certain battalion of our army took the opportunity to charge at the ×. The ×'s strength was weak, and they collapsed in one battle, retreating towards Fengyong. Our army launched an ambush, inflicting heavy casualties. By noon, the × in the vicinity of Tanbu were fleeing south. Our army is pursuing the victory.

### ×'s Internal Emptiness Leads to Rampant Robberies in Guangzhou - × Plans to Transfer Zhu Sheng Bing to Be in Charge of Security in the City - Our Guerrilla Team Achieves Victory in a Night Attack on Guangya Academy

[Guangzhou Express] The × army entrenched in Guangzhou is terrified by our attacks on various lines. News of this has been repeatedly reported. In recent days, the situation in Guangzhou has become even more chaotic, and the panic among the × army is even greater than before. A summary of the events is recorded below:

Rumors of Zhu Sheng Bing Being Transferred as Puppet Mayor

Since surrendering to the ×, Zhu Sheng Bing (i.e., Luo Bing) has spared no effort to ingratiate himself with the ×, attempting to win their favor. It has been found that the Luo traitor participated in several battles in which the × army attacked Jiangzeng after capturing Daliang Ronggui, and he also dispatched a group of ugly characters to assist the × troops in their invasion. Therefore, he has gained the appreciation of the × army. Recently, due to insufficient strength, the × army on various routes has transferred most of the × in Guangzhou to supplement them, resulting in internal emptiness. It is rumored that Ando, the commander of the southward invading ×, is planning to transfer the Luo traitor to serve as the puppet mayor of Guangzhou, responsible for maintaining order in the city. Luo's henchmen have recently infiltrated Guangzhou one after another, engaging in large-scale activities.

Guerrilla Team Attacks Guangya Academy

The weather in this city has been poor recently, with continuous spring rain. On the 27th, the guerrilla team ambushing in the suburbs of the city learned that a large number of military supplies of the × army were stored in Guangya Academy in Xicun. That night, at about 1:00 AM, led by a certain Liang, they sneaked towards the × through the lychee groves for a night attack. The moonlight was dim, and they advanced quickly with muffled steps. When they arrived, the × troops stationed at the academy were still unaware. Our guerrilla team suddenly rushed in, first killing two × sentries. They then launched a fierce grenade attack on the × inside the academy, firing more than a hundred grenades continuously, and set fire to the × army's camps. Then, they retreated.

Disorderly Order in Guangzhou City

The × army in Guangzhou is terrified because it has been thinned out and because our guerrilla team is active. Since the 25th, they have only been on guard in the city during the day. At 6:00 PM, they all retreat to the suburbs, daring not to stay overnight in the city. As a result, local ruffians and rogues have been active in the city, and incidents of robbery and theft occur frequently. It has been found that at about 10:00 PM on the 27th, more than twenty thieves broke into the Japanese-owned Qiao Ye store in Dongqiaokou through a broken tile roof and a wooden door in the sky, secretly opened the front door, and stole a batch of valuables. As they were preparing to escape, they were discovered by Ling Ye, a clerk of the × store, who blew a whistle to call the police. The gang of thieves immediately drew their guns and shot him repeatedly, killing two × store clerks on the spot. The × military police rushed to rescue them after receiving the report, but the gang of thieves had already fled. The disorderly order in Guangzhou city is evident from this.

Movies and Drama

### Challenging America - The Rise of French Films - Low Production Costs Surprise Hollywood

Recently, the authorities of American film companies received information from officials stationed in France that the low production costs of French films were a great surprise. It is said that French film company managers maintain the principle of keeping the cost of producing a film to no more than two million francs. At the current exchange rate, two million francs is equivalent to only US$50,000. Compared to the production costs of films made in Hollywood, the difference is truly immeasurable.

(1) Unexpected Success

French films are produced at such low costs, yet films like "Un Carnet de Bal," "Lo Mioche," "Grande Illusion," and "Ballerina" have achieved unexpected success when released in the United States. French film companies are hoping to send more productions across the Atlantic to be released in the United States in 1939, and the cost of these films will be kept below US$100,000.

(2) Expense Allocation

If we conduct further research, we find that even the most expensive French films cost no more than 2.8 million francs. The themes of most scripts are based on modern novels or stories, and the writers receive 5% of the cost, which is at most 140,000 francs. An ordinary director also receives 5% of the cost. The main cast members generally receive 25%, the technical staff 15%, and the cost of the film studio will be several hundred thousand francs. The rest is allocated to writing, composition, costumes, set design, and film stock. This method of allocation is completely different from that in Hollywood. The salaries of technical staff are higher than those of actors. The salaries of male and female stars, even the highest paid, are far lower than those of major Hollywood stars. However, the cost of various set designs is very high in French films. Many films are made in cooperation with the French army or navy.

(3) Films Not Made

There are very few French musicals and not many films featuring scantily clad women or chorus lines. All dangerous events, such as volcanic eruptions, rising tides, hurricanes, fires, icebergs, and hippos, are not filmed due to the high costs involved.

(4) Challenging America

Because of its emphasis on realism, French films focus on romance. The recent production of films imitating typical American blockbusters shows that they are only challenging Hollywood, and American critics have already pointed out that France has several stars who will amaze people.

### Hollywood Stars' Standards for Choosing a Spouse

A French reporter went to Hollywood to inquire about the conditions that local male stars look for in a spouse (note: this refers only to appearance, physique, and character; other conditions such as property, profession, and education are not discussed). According to the male stars' opinions:

(1) They love women with auburn hair because most of these women are beautiful.

(2) They admire slim women (of course, not women who are thin as a rail or weak and frail). They do not consider women athletes with plenty of curves to be their ideal partners. There is a popular saying in Hollywood: "A curve is not the shortest distance from one point to another, so it is not an interesting line." This saying fully expresses their dislike of muscular bodies.

(3) They love women who are happy, cheerful, lively, and slightly silly because marrying such a woman can easily comfort a husband in daily life and help him forget the hard work. On the contrary, marrying a woman who is sad all day long is like putting a machine for creating trouble and tragedy in the house.

According to the female stars' opinions on choosing a husband:

(1) They love to marry men with brown hair because most American men have brown hair. Men with black and dark hair are not welcome because dark hair makes the face appear unkind.

(2) They love tall and thin men with long legs.

(3) They love men who are natural, unconstrained, tell jokes well, and have a heroic spirit. Silent, gentlemanly Englishmen are considered the most boring.

### Husband, Wife, Friend

Produced by Twentieth Century Fox

Starring

Dorothy - Loretta Young

Leona - Warner Baxter

Hugo - Cesar Romero

Leona quickly moved her lips away from the wine glass, cocking an ear to listen at the door, faintly hearing Dorothy singing "Mi Mi Mi—" at the other end of the room.

She felt a chill on her back, as if a cold wind had blown over her. The Persian rug on the floor also seemed to turn into a pile of snow under her feet, and a look of doubt appeared on her dark and strong face.

White also heard it, and he shook his white-haired head and snorted, gulping down the wine in his glass and saying, "Misfortune in the White family! I knew it! My child, you really shouldn't have gone to the opera tonight. I understand that it has started again, that cursed thing has been born again!"

"But," Leona replied, "Dorothy doesn't really want to be in the singing profession. When we got married, I simply told her that she would go crazy if she kept doing this, and she immediately abandoned her own ideas. That was five years ago. She hasn't mentioned it until now." He added doubtfully, "Of course, I didn't ask her for a definite promise."

White snorted again. He felt that he was Dorothy's father and knew his daughter's character very well. He asked, "Why didn't you let her work hard to pursue her aspirations and become a successful singer?"

Leona stammered, "I have my reasons."

"I understand," White said solemnly, then sighed. "In 1860, Dorothy's grandmother ran away from home to sing on the stage in Florence. That was the result of the Civil War. Dorothy's mother wanted to become an opera singer every year for twenty-seven years. For twenty-seven winters, she rented a hall and sang there - only herself. Now Dorothy is doing the same."

Leona didn't speak, lighting a cigarette in distress.

White continued, "I don't think her singing is the worst in the world! It's good enough to sing in church or in the living room, but to go to a concert or opera stage—ha, what a joke!" He glanced at Leona, "You know this, I know this, and everyone knows it, only the women in the White family don't know it. Music has a special tradition in this family. It was very unfortunate for Dorothy's mother. I think the failure in the twenty-seventh year can finally put an end to it. I tell you, the first time I heard my daughter practicing singing, I immediately ran to the club, locked the door, and hid in the room for five days without eating anything!"

"Mi Mi Mi Mi…!" Dorothy's singing came from afar.

Then there was a sound of the door opening, and Miss White's voice said, "Beautiful, I love it!" Even though she was so quick-tongued, White didn't have time to put down his wine glass and pretend that he hadn't been drinking, she had already walked in, and as soon as she saw him, she showed an angry expression, said good night, and went out.

The White couple's family had a high social status. When Dorothy and Leona got married, she was furious. Leona, although a successful contractor, was just an ordinary businessman. The young couple was indeed passionately in love, but what use was that for the glory of the world?

Dorothy, who deeply loved her husband, often joked that Leona's ancestors had no glory, and that he resembled them very much. She sat in front of the mirror in the dressing room, holding a blue slipper in her hand, striking poses as she spoke. She had not yet taken off her white evening dress, which made her fair shoulders and bright golden hair even more prominent. Leona said she was a beauty from a book. He said, "Listen, your eyes are bluer than the sapphires on your earrings!"

### Today's Doubles Tennis Semifinals - Defending Champions vs. Newcomers - Xu Brothers vs. Lin Tiande and Huang Jinxi

[Report from Our Newspaper] The island's tennis players are active regardless of the cold or heat. Now that the soccer season has just ended, the tennis matches have become intense again.

This year's lawn tennis tournament has an especially large number of participants, so the competition days have been extended. It started in early March and has lasted for two months. During the competition, the weak have been eliminated, and the strong have been retained. We are now at the final stage.

At 5:00 PM today, there will be a doubles semifinal match between the Xu brothers (Pei Run and Pei) and Lin Tiande and Huang Jinxi. The competition will be held at the Hong Kong Cricket Club field.

The Xu brothers soared to fame in the previous tournament, and their reputation has increased tenfold. Their skills have improved even more, and it is expected that they will retain the championship this time.

Lin and Huang are newcomers, and they both have considerable skills, but they are still inferior to the Xu brothers. It is expected that victory will undoubtedly belong to the Xu brothers.

Looking at recent trends, the doubles championship will be contested by the Xu brothers and the Lin Zhen brothers. However, although the Xu brothers have been invincible in the recent past and have reached this near-championship position, their past performances have been erratic, sometimes far from their normal standards. Now that it has reached a critical moment, they must be careful in their response. If they complete this victory, they will be one step closer to the championship. (Dong Lang)

### Yesterday's Second Division Basketball Matches Were Fiercely Contested - Green Team's Zhong Sheng and Guangzhong Victorious - Tonight's Three Matches Are All Worth Watching - Green Team Defeats Red Star

[Report from Our Newspaper] Three Second Division matches were held yesterday for the Open Men's Basketball Tournament. In the first match, the Green Team played against the Red Star. The Green Team was stronger and had better coordination. They repeatedly broke through the Red Star's formation with surprise attacks, and then used flanking attacks. Therefore, after resisting, the Red Star lost 28-39.

Zhong Sheng Defeats Qing Zhi

In the second match, Qing Zhi played against Zhong Sheng. From the start, Qing Zhi showed its sharpness, with five riders advancing side by side and achieving gains. However, Zhong Sheng did not show weakness, resisting the attacking force on one hand and counterattacking during the gaps on the other hand. Therefore, it developed into a very tense situation. At the end of the first half, Qing Zhi only led by a narrow margin of 23-20. After changing baskets, Qing Zhi's momentum was like that of a rainbow, attacking tirelessly. Zhong Sheng responded calmly and defended effectively. Later, because Qing Zhi's repeated attacks failed, their morale was frustrated, and Zhong Sheng took the opportunity to attack fiercely, causing them to be busy coping and their formation to gradually become chaotic. As a result, Zhong Sheng reversed the defeat and won 50-45.

Guangzhong Defeats Guan Lei

In the final match, Guan Lei played against Guangzhong. Both sides had strong players and the match was fiercely contested. After the game started, they fought fiercely for a long time and were evenly matched, first tying at 4-4. Later, Chen Qiangchu and Feng Zehong of Guangzhong advanced on two fronts, frequently sending good news. Chuan Yu Kui and Xu Zhen of Guan Lei then struggled to defend and retaliate. Therefore, the two armies engaged in a melee at this time, which was extremely intense. At the end of the first half, Guangzhong had the advantage with 20-16. In the second half, Guan Lei exerted all its strength and frequently put pressure on Guangzhong's position. Guangzhong also tried its best to compete. Ten minutes before the end of the game, Guan Lei's offense and defense gradually became unsustainable. Guangzhong then took the opportunity to pounce fiercely, causing Guan Lei to be attacked on all sides. At the end of the game, Guan Lei lost 38-47.

### Popularizing School Sports: Increasing General Classes is Necessary

— Excellence

Regarding school sports in Hong Kong, due to environmental factors and the problem of space, the development of school sports has faced significant obstacles. Especially after the motherland launched the War of Resistance, students flocked to Hong Kong for safety and education, leading to a sudden increase in the student population. Each school and class has an unmanageable number of students. Just imagine, how can so many students actively exercise together in a small space? Furthermore, due to environmental factors, many schools have leaned towards gymnastic equipment exercises. Although these exercises are good, many students are not suited to them due to their physical condition, and teachers must not blindly implement them, lest they harm the students' physical and mental health. Nor can teaching be tailored only to the few students who are suited to them. As a result, many students cannot enjoy the benefits of physical education training during regular class time and can only stand idly by. If the students are a bit more mischievous, their attempts to observe can lead to many disruptions to the order of instruction. In my personal opinion, if we want to encourage students to work hard during regular classes and make up for the lack of training for students who miss classes, it is necessary to increase general classes. For example, recently, Chung Wah Middle School, feeling that many of its students were pampered and weak and that many parents even directly asked the school for leave during regular classes, preventing them from enjoying physical education training and thus not adapting to the demands of the current extraordinary times, decided to add fitness classes. These classes are specifically designed for weak students. All those who do not work hard at exercise during regular classes or are unable to attend regular training must enter these classes for training. This class can be created to meet the school's needs. In my personal opinion, the most suitable curriculum for this class would be lively games, gymnastics, and therapeutic exercises. Whether this is suitable, I urge comrades to correct. I have said a lot that seems irrelevant to this article, and it may even seem like I am promoting something specific, but this is a bit of fact, a real example. It is to form a lively class from the students who are relatively weak, dispirited, and do not work hard at exercise during regular classes, and to provide them with suitable teaching materials, to intensify training, and to strive for the health of all students in the school. I believe that there are many schools in Hong Kong that are in the same environment as this school, and such classes are indeed closely related to the popularization of school sports. I will now elaborate on what I have seen: (1)

### Swimming Guide: Breaststroke (2)

— Pan Congshao

At the beginning of the entire movement, the posture should not involve the head being raised too high, the body excessively tilted, or the entire posture being deeply submerged in the water. The latter makes breathing more difficult due to the increased pressure from the depth of the water. Both bad postures clearly indicate that the body is not floating effectively. Try to float in the water with the body forming a straight line, and the problems of the body being too exposed or too submerged will quickly diminish.

Continued practice is necessary for improving the breaststroke. General swimming practice usually involves swimming from one end of a 25-meter to 50-meter pool to the other in continuous breaststroke movements. What also needs attention is the turning method. When the body swims to a point still about a foot away from the end of the pool, taking advantage of the forward movement of the body, the body, if possible, should have the left hand touch the pool wall (or turning board), and exerting force downwards to the right. At this time, the upper body is approaching the edge of the pool. Once the right hand adds force to the wall, the upper body flips over in direction, and the sole of the foot is against the pool wall. Without any delay, use the limbs to gather near the pool edge, and in a bent and suitable posture, vigorously push off with the foot, propelling the straightened body forward. The force of this turn can propel the body through a distance of more than five meters in the water. The posture for turning in breaststroke does not allow for deviation; both hands must touch the edge of the pool together. If turning to the left, the left hand that is touching the pool edge must simultaneously move further to the left, bringing the body closer to the edge of the pool. When the body is directly facing left, both feet must be ready to stick to the edge of the pool to propel the body forward.

Turning is a good opportunity for the limbs to rest. Especially as the body moves forward away from the edge of the pool, the limbs are stretched straight, and the muscles are constantly working hard. Resting at this point is particularly useful for those participating in swimming competitions. If you have plenty of energy, you don't need to exhale before turning, but if you are not skilled, you will feel tired after exhaling and pressing down in the water while moving forward after turning.

The breaststroke movement is also necessary for underwater swimming. To swim underwater, it is not necessary to adopt its posture; the breaststroke movement is the most suitable. A previous article has already been published regarding underwater swimming practice methods. (The End)

### Track and Field Results of Two Schools

The Wah Yan College Old Boys' Association held its second annual track and field meet yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Caroline Hill South Sports Ground.

### The Development of Poetry

— Huang Sheng

Poets greet the arrival of the great era with fervent singing.

The outbreak of the national liberation struggle stirs up a tide of emotion in the hearts of poets; the flames of national liberation struggle temper the sinews and bones of poets, enabling them to gradually overcome the erroneous tendencies of sectarianism and individualism; at the same time, the establishment of the national united front and the gradual development of mass movements provide excellent conditions for the development of the poetry movement, and the advocacy and practice of popularizing poetry is the broad road for poetry to move forward.

Poets have gained new life in creation during the struggle, and the vigorous atmosphere of the poetry movement is unprecedented. However, our harvest is far from full, and better achievements still depend on the continuous efforts of poets; we do not have enough workers, and the poetry movement has not yet been fully developed; in particular, our movement has not yet formed a close link with the lives of the people, and the poets' tempering of their lives and practical experience needs to be stepped up and strengthened.

An author said that the manuscripts received by literary publications are mostly poetry; however, each publication is limited to poetry occupying one-eighth of the whole, and writers are also constrained, so poetry cannot expand. This statement is questionable. The fact that publications receive so much poetry shows that there are relatively the largest number of poetry authors, but it also shows that poetry authors have a casual attitude. It is not the publication that is hindering the expansion of poetry, but rather that the efforts of poetry authors are not enough, and they must bear the greatest responsibility.

In the early days of the War of Resistance, poets were captured by the phenomenon of the outbreak of the struggle and, almost without thinking or experiencing, poured out their fiery emotions on paper, issuing poems of shouting, roaring, and screaming. This was a surge of romanticism, which stimulated, incited, and inspired, and fulfilled such a task in the early days of the War of Resistance. Poetry is a product of society, and the reality of the early days of the War of Resistance determined the 'initial nature' of anti-Japanese war poetry at that time.

However, the surge of shouting-style poetry fell into the quagmire of sloganization and formulaization. The arrangement of slogans and labels lacked emotional integration and lacked true images, thus losing the life and power of poetry. This crooked path of creation has now been criticized by comparison. Mu Mutian said it well: "During this period of resistance and nation-building, we must be romantic in emotion and realistic in cognition. A poet in his own era should be a romanticist, and at the same time, he should also be a realist... There must be a strong romantic emotion in a poem, and at the same time, there must be a strong realistic image."

In fact, poets have also stopped from the stage of shouting and moved towards the road of lyricism with flesh and blood, from coarse to meticulous, from emotional impulse to the deepening of human emotion, from concepts to images. This is the progress of poets. Jiang Bishun's "The Struggle for Tianzhu Tian" and "Don't Cry! Twist Your Head," and Chang Min's "Sacrifice" and "Road" are all clear signs. All poetry workers should run together on this road to achieve the complete liquidation of slogan-formula poetry.

Furthermore, the poetry movement must form a close link with the lives of the people, and the development of poetry will have a brighter future. Poets have accepted the instruction of this theory and are using poetry reading as a concrete route of practice. On the one hand, they use poetry reading to educate the people, and on the other hand, they gain education in this practice, achieving the completion of the popularization of poetry. This kind of effort is worthy of cherishing.

Here, I would like to point out that in order for poetry to be accepted by the masses, not only must the form be suitable for the masses, be catchy, and use the vocabulary of the masses, but the content must also be suitable for the masses, reflect the lives of the masses, and use meaningful things that have happened and are happening in the masses as the content of poetry. Narrative poetry is the most popular among the masses, and the creation of great narrative poems is precisely the highest demand of the revolution on poets. Then, lyrical poetry should gradually give way to narrative poetry. Naturally, there is no clear distinction between lyrical poetry and narrative poetry.

### "Candy" and "Whip"

— Yin Sanlang

According to reports, fascist countries consistently use the "candy" and "whip" policy.

"Candy" and "whip" seem to be non-opposing terms, but in fact, if we observe the current world dynamics and are not too forgetful, we will definitely feel that the so-called "candy" and "whip" are indeed very connected.

Opening up the newspapers of the past half-year is full of great achievements regarding "candy" and "whip." Isn't it? Those small countries in Eastern Europe, like Czechoslovakia, Albania, Spain, etc., have suffered the pain of the "whip" under the temptation of "candy."

Fascist countries rely on their weapons and want to seize and snatch from the east and west every day to get some benefits. But mankind has a natural wit and intelligence, so if fascist aggression is coveting it, the first step will never be to reveal its original hideous face. It must use the old trick of stealing candy from adults and deceiving children to seduce it with "candy." Therefore, they first sign some economic agreements, military agreements, etc., with a small country, and when that country is hesitating and considering, it sounds very palatable. Once the first step of the "candy" strategy has succeeded, they gradually reveal their original ferocious appearance. By the time they realize they have been fooled and want to change direction, it is too late, and they have already tasted the most vicious taste of the "whip."

Although the universe is large, the principles are the same. Even if we look closer at that fascist ally in the Far East, isn't it playing the same trick? Before the "July 7th" Incident, it consistently used "candy" such as "Sino-Japanese Friendship," "Economic Cooperation," and "Coexistence and Co-prosperity" to gift us. At that time, we really felt it was a matter of "disrespectful to refuse, and painful to accept."

Today, as it uses the "whip" to intensify its beating and reveals its true colors, it is still distributing those beautiful "candies" in the occupied areas. Things like "Establishing a New Order in East Asia" and "Reviving a New China" are all despicable tricks of adults deceiving children. What is regrettable is that there are no complete fools in the world who will always taste its "candy" without feeling the bitterness.

Now, those who have eaten its "candy" and suffered the taste of the "whip" have all understood and have firmly raised the "whip of justice" in their hands to resist the beating of the invaders' "unreasonable whip." And I believe that in the near future, there will be a day when the "whip of justice" shatters the "tyrannical whip"!

### The Songs of the Dragons

— Wallflower

On a starless evening, amidst the sounds of a bustling orchestra and the drunken revelry, I left the inevitable feast and walked alone to this desolate corner.

Abandoned by the happy people, this desolate corner!

Sadly, a few scattered pedestrians, like ghosts, moved silently.

(In the distance, on the dark plain, a fierce beast guards the night!

Suddenly, a magnificent and impassioned song burst out from the long circle of walls on the other side, interwoven with anger and valor.

A shadow crossed my heart:

I remembered that locked up inside this secluded wall were eight hundred biting dragons! They had a glorious and immortal history! Now, they only had their rainbow-like heroism, but were deprived of their freedom and burdened with chains!

They dwell in seclusion in lonely days, and a surge of passion to protect their motherland, as well as accusations against the enemy, naturally turned into a song, broadcast in the night space.

Oh, magnificent and impassioned song, you tremble the darkness, tremble the universe!

My heart beats even more with the agitation!

### Mouth of the Fengchuan River (Continued)

— Du Wenhui

Suddenly, in the distant azure sky, two enemy planes painted with the Rising Sun emblem were spotted, flying towards our boat. The first to see them were the owners of these brick and tile boats. He was an old man in his fifties, very experienced in navigating the West River. He was a kind and timid merchant. As soon as he saw the enemy planes, he panicked and shouted frantically, "Quickly moor the boats! Quick—ly! Quick! Quick!" His companions were rushing to moor the boats, shouting without experience, running in all directions, some taking out their only cloth bundles or even cotton quilts and clothes from the cabins, carrying them on their shoulders and running ashore. But the most pitiful was the old man; what could he take away? The bricks and tiles on these boats were all his livelihood and property.

He was so frightened that his face turned pale, and his body and teeth were trembling. He asked me pleadingly:

"Mr. Du, what should we do? Everything is finished... If I am bombed to death, you must tell my family!... " He spread his hands in despair.

"Don't be afraid, old man. Calm down and come with me to take shelter!..." I comforted him, and I dragged his trembling, frail hand ashore. He was a little attached to the boat.

The embankment was empty. Only about ten feet away from the embankment was a lychee tree like a crab claw flower, and we crouched in the sparse shade of the tree to hide. At this time, the enemy plane was circling over the boat, scouting whether the boat was carrying troops. The old man suddenly became afraid of death. He wanted to run to the distant village. I knew his intention, so I pulled my hand back, pointed at him, and said:

"Don't run, old man! Otherwise, I will shoot you! If you leave now, the enemy plane will spot the target..." He was even more afraid, but he finally submitted timidly. He kept muttering:

"If I am bombed to death, you must tell my family." I found him a bit pitiful and ridiculous. Wasn't I with him? If he was bombed to death, I certainly wouldn't be an exception.

The enemy plane dropped three black objects. One fell into the paddy field on the opposite bank, and two fell on the brick and tile boats and exploded. The old man shouted hysterically, but it was drowned out by the deafening sound of the bombing. Sand and gravel flew all over the banks and into the river, and the other boats were shaken crooked or overturned.

Black smoke and flames filled the sky. The enemy plane circled for a while and flew towards the distant azure. The old man's weeping could be heard clearly. He was crying for the loss of his property! A few minutes after the enemy plane left, the old man and I walked to the embankment, his eyes wet. Tears were hanging on his cheeks.

Broken bricks and tiles were scattered here and there on both banks and in the river. Broken boat planks filled the river, some still spewing smoke and fire. The old man sat on the embankment in despair until his companions returned from the distant village, and he seemed to wake up from a dream and told his companions to collect the few wooden boats that had not been bombed.

It took all day to finally repair his remaining boats. At dusk, our boat gradually drifted away from the mouth of the river in the darkness of the night, surrounded by a group of curious farmers. The old man was deeply plunged into sorrow. I comforted him along the way until we reached Zhaoqing.

That night in Zhaoqing, the old man jumped into the river in the middle of the night. When our companions discovered it, the old man had already been swept away by the turbid flood of the West River.

The next day at dawn, when the autumn sun shone on the cliffs of the Seven Star Crags, I looked out at the withered reeds under the rocks and the shadows of a few fishing boats. I commemorated the kind and timid old man with a painful and regretful feeling. I remembered that he had told me: "If I am bombed to death, you must tell my family!" Yes, I will tell his family! But why did the old man die? I felt a little lost! It was as if I was sitting in a fog. I noticed the reeds beside the boat, which had a little bit of saltiness on them. Were these not the tears on the old man's cheeks? Oh, I understand, that's why he died!

### Mr. Lu

— Xiao Xu

Mr. Lu was again expressing his profound views there, his head shaking back and forth, the veins on his forehead bulging out:

"Ah, the current Chinese people are really awful... Um... That's why I say: everyone over the age of ten should die... Yes: should all die..." He deliberately repeated the last sentence emphatically. His head shook triumphantly a couple more times.

"Then what about you? Should you die too? What a pity!" Someone was teasing him jokingly.

"Um, that, that, that of course, let my children live, and let them reform China..." His face flushed even redder.

"Ha... But your two daughters... When they ask people for candy, their skill is no less than those officials who were good at fleecing the people in the past!"

"Um... that..."

"Hahahaha!" It caused a burst of laughter.

Mr. Lu was just a young man in his thirties, but he always loved to express these pedantic and nonsensical empty talks. Sometimes, if his colleagues asked him:

"Then what about our old principal? Should he die too?"

He would then say contemptuously: "Oh! Of course! To be honest: these old men in their fifties and sixties are all useless. Look at the traitors of those two puppet governments, aren't they all in their fifties and sixties?..."

"But... Mr. Lu... how old is your esteemed father?"

"Oh!... that... that..." Then there was another burst of laughter.

Mr. Lu's esteemed father was over sixty, but he still left home despite the hardship, following the government westward to serve the country; however, Mr. Lu himself, when the government moved to Hankou, said:

"Um: I should resign!... My family is still in Shanghai..." So he ran back! Leaving his old father alone there.

When people said that he should go to the interior to serve the country and take care of his old father, he would flush red again and stammer:

"Um... that... that... There are also many jobs in Shanghai... Moreover... I still have a family..."

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

"Who is it? It is China!"

A humorous beginning, a painful ending.

It is difficult to convince a person, but easy to let life influence them, and it is also the most effective. Therefore, she was pacing restlessly in that room that was temporarily her own. Her steps were so heavy and messy; as if matching the rhythm of her heavy and messy thoughts. In the rise and fall of her steps, time was being prolonged so indecisively. In this monotonous and slow movement, it seemed as if she was saying, wasn't the motherland the sacred poem praised by poets? Wasn't it the glorious burial ground where heroes and warriors of the past sacrificed to defend it? It seemed as if she was saying, are they the modern heroes and warriors? It seemed as if she was saying, could her father be the traitor to the motherland cursed by the general public—their opposite? It seemed as if she was saying, in between these two, where exactly should she go?... The disturbing and unforgettable thoughts were distressing. She clenched her fists and kept hitting the palm of her other hand. She wished to replace the worries of thoughts with physical pain. Her fair and tender hands—a part of all her beauty—were beaten until they looked as if they had been dyed red by cherry juice, but she still could not smooth out the wrinkles of worry in her heart. When she stamped the floor, she was already crying. The tears of the weak are not precious.

Her crying startled the only acquaintance, who came to see her—with love on one hand and surveillance on the other. He looked at her beautiful face, which was after all much more haggard than when he had seen her last night, but still resembled a fresh flower, making people love her, still making it difficult to believe that she was the daughter of a vile traitor. At this moment, he even thought of a fresh flower—she, its growing place, why was it not a pure and holy place, but a dirty garbage heap—her father. He also looked at her chest, beating unevenly, and the bright, crystal-like teardrops on her face. He was worried that such a small life as hers could not withstand too much trauma. Therefore, he silently cursed her father—the traitor to the motherland. Her father's crimes were not hers, so why was she suffering for her father? Could it be that the misfortune of the innocent will always exist in this world?
