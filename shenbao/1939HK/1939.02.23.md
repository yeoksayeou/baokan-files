### How England and France Responded to Japan

Since Japanese troops have already landed on Hainan Island in our country, the British and French ambassadors to Tokyo successively questioned Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, requesting an explanation. The content of the British and French questions has not been published, and we have no way of knowing the details; however, purely within the scope of diplomacy, the treaties, agreements, and declarations that can be relied upon, as well as the promises repeatedly made by Japan, are not only rich in data but also full of arguments, which cannot be evaded by the other party through sophistry. However, judging from the Japanese government's public statement of Foreign Minister Arita's response to the British and French ambassadors, it seems that the two ambassadors did not make every effort to argue based on diplomatic principles. Perhaps, being keenly aware that diplomacy is ineffective, they did not want to waste words; they only questioned as a matter of international practice, barely fulfilling their duties to the minimum extent within the scope of diplomacy. However, judging from common sense and reason, is it not better to force the other party to engage in deception and prevarication than to do nothing? If so, why bother to do this? Or, knowing that the other party will inevitably engage in deception and prevarication, instead of confronting them with righteous and stern words, they only bow and offer their questions. Our country encounters outright plunder, while England and France encounter subtle extortion. The methods of what they encounter are different, so our country is forced into悲壯, ××××××, but both are the most sympathetic countries in the world today. Our War of Resistance has lasted for more than eighteen months. How can we get the British and French governments and peoples, ××××××××××××, to actively engage outside the scope of diplomacy?

After questioning, what will England and France do next? Saying that diplomacy is ineffective, how do we know that diplomatic skills will not be exhausted? Thus, not only is Arita's reply predictable to anyone with a little experience, but the extreme of hypocrisy and deception is not unexpected; even if further protests are made, they will inevitably be as fruitless as expected. Did Arita not say that Japan has no territorial ambitions for Hainan Island? What is territory? The Northeast is our country's territory, but Japan's oppression, exploitation, and various forms of autocracy and manipulation in our Northeast are far greater than what their warlords can impose within their three islands. Japan still keeps saying that it is the "Manchukuo," and Japan has no territorial ambitions. By analogy, Japan does not necessarily have to say that it will seize Hainan Island as territory. Did Arita not also say that the timing and nature of the occupation of Hainan Island do not exceed military needs? Japan's war against China has nothing to do with one island, yet it uses military needs as an excuse to occupy it. With the endless arms race in the international community today, how can there be a day when this island is not needed? As international relations become increasingly tense in the future, can it not be said that it is needed for the so-called "lifeline of the empire," the so-called "New Order in East Asia," and the so-called "Peace in the Pacific"? Questioning a hundred times, protesting a hundred times, will result in two hundred such replies. One of their intentions will be that there is no need for such replies; Japan will have achieved slight success in China, and its operations will have taken deep root. The fertile land of forty million square miles, the forty-five million people, and our country's resources, materials, and manpower will all be used for their expansionist ambitions without any regard for the world. The European and American countries will swallow their anger and, with the utmost spirit of freedom and the most peaceful methods, willingly withdraw from East Asia. England and France will no longer question Hainan! Their intention is not far off; the day when the totalitarian countries have grown their wings will be the time when democratic countries ××××. Annam, Borneo, Burma, the Philippines, ××××, Hainan Island is just the beginning.

In Arita's reply, there is also a noteworthy hint. He said that the Japanese troops landed on Hainan Island to "weaken General Chiang's resistance force and hasten its downfall." This is another deceptive talk. The weakening is Japan's diversionary tactic, weakening its own forces of aggression. But what can be clearly proven is that the fate of Hainan Island cannot be changed by your diplomatic questions, and the fate of Hainan Island is determined by the War of Resistance led by Chairman Chiang. With this hint, if England and France are not comfortable with Japan's occupation of Hainan Island, the only way is to use the greatest determination, the strongest perseverance, and the quickest method to assist our country's War of Resistance to the greatest possible extent. France once worried that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island would threaten Annam. Therefore, disregarding our country's right to transport goods according to the Sino-French Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Treaty, disregarding the resolution of the League of Nations to provide as much assistance as possible to China to prevent the weakening of China's resistance force, disregarding the opportunity for economic prosperity in Annam, disregarding the profits from the transport of goods on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and disregarding the most friendly relations between China and France, France accepted Japan's demand not to transport our country's military supplies. How long has it been? Japan replied to France with the fact that Japanese troops had landed on Hainan Island. England once hindered China's destruction of Hankou for immediate petty profits and compromised with Japan on tariff issues. How long has it been? Japan replied to England with the fact that these are all our spoils, and you cannot interfere. At that time, and even now, England and France's compromise and appeasement are very understandable. Now that various facts have shown that compromise cannot achieve peace, there is no other way than to respond to Japan with effective action. What effective action? There are too many to list. Focusing on the matter at hand, first, use the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to provide our country with the convenience of transporting military supplies as much as possible, as a response to the Japanese troops' brazen landing on Hainan Island; furthermore, vigorously assist the War of Resistance from other aspects as a response to Japan's claim to eliminate our country's resistance force. These are just two examples.

### World Dynamics During the Spring Festival—From February 16th to 22nd—

For the Lunar New Year, this newspaper, in accordance with the resolution of the Hong Kong press, will cease publication for seven days from February 16th to 22nd. During these seven days, the "Hong Kong Press Joint Publication," organized by this newspaper, will continue to work hard to report news in order to fulfill its duty as a newspaper. However, due to limited space, it may not be able to meet expectations, and long-term subscribers may not receive home delivery as usual. There may be much unfamiliarity with recent Chinese and foreign affairs in the past week. Therefore, we will selectively analyze and report, hoping that readers will pay attention.

1.  Recent Seven-Day Battle Situation

During the seven days of the Spring Festival, there were no major changes in the overall war situation. The Japanese ×'s landing on Hainan Island not only did not affect our overall War of Resistance but also further strengthened our determination to persevere in the War of Resistance and the belief that final victory will be achieved sooner. In the South China theater, × people dispatched a part of their elite to forcibly land on Hainan Island, striving to shorten the Guangdong front, concentrating their strength to consolidate Guangzhou and control the traffic of the North River and West River, and dispatching troops to support×南, further creating a situation of westward invasion of Guangxi and ×南. Their main attempt is to echo the adventure of the German × in Europe and to test the attitudes of England and France, preparing for the conquest of the Pacific; at the same time, they are using pro-Japanese and anti-communist traitors to exaggerate the power of the Japanese × and promote the "politics" of the Japanese × in Guangdong, attempting to confuse people's minds and facilitate ×'s new offensive preparations. But we have insight into its good intentions, exposing the ambition of the Japanese × to occupy Hainan Island to threaten England, Holland, France, and the United States, so that England and France have adopted a tougher attitude; at the same time, we carefully and bravely implement a new strategy, taking the offensive in the East River and North River to continue to contain and weaken the × people's forces, and the defense of the West River South Road has recently reached a perfect level, ready to implement a counteroffensive at any time to break the × people's offensive plan. On Hainan Island, our local garrison and the brave troops reorganized from the Red Army have annihilated nearly ten thousand × people. In the counterattack on Ding'an on the seventh day alone, more than one thousand × troops were killed or wounded. Currently, the entire island's population has been mobilized to prepare for a desperate battle, and they are looking forward to spiritual and material assistance from home and abroad. On the North China battlefield, the center of the war will be along the Yellow River, and continuous artillery battles have been fought on both sides of the river in Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi provinces; the × army is still constantly reinforcing the three provinces of Sui, Jin, and Jin. However, it is found that there are less than five thousand × people between Fenglingdu and Yongji, and less than twenty thousand × troops in southern Jin and eastern Jin, and they are constantly attacked and injured by our Taihang and Zhongtiao guerrilla troops. In addition, the militia in the two provinces of Sui and Chahar have also established contact with the Jin × Hebei border area and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area, actively launching counterattacks, causing the reinforcements × to be intercepted and weakened. In eastern and northern Shandong, there have also been bloody battles in recent days, and the × 5th Division has been severely damaged. Now, the military and economic construction in the northwest is progressing rapidly, and international assistance is also quite optimistic. Although the × army has claimed to launch a large-scale offensive after the Spring Festival, we have prepared for it. In the Central China theater, the front lines of the three provinces of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui are unchanged, and the Soviet-Zhejiang × army and the Anhui-Jiangxi × are united. The former intends to attack eastern Zhejiang from sea and land to cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and the latter intends to attack Nanchang from the south, but both have been intercepted by us and have not succeeded. At the same time, our army is actively counterattacking Wuchang, Yueyang, and both sides of the Nanchang-Xunyang Road, so that the × army's offensive plan cannot be realized. In addition, what is particularly noteworthy is that our new air force has established a remarkable feat during the Spring Festival. The ×艦×陣 in eastern Anhui and southern习 has been bombed by us for days. In the Changsha air battle on the 15th, seven × bombers were shot down, and in the Lanzhou air battle on the 20th, as many as nine × aircraft were shot down. In short, the overall war situation has gradually trended towards the second stage of our × strength equilibrium×, and we firmly believe that as long as we can strengthen unity, persist in the War of Resistance, and strive for political progress and foreign aid progress, victory will come sooner!

2.  The Third Session of the National参政会

The third session of the National参政会 opened on February 12th and closed on the 21st. In addition to the first, second, and third meetings, in which the heads of various departments reported on internal affairs, diplomacy, military affairs, finance, economy, education, etc., a total of nine meetings were held. Dozens of important bills on internal affairs, economy, finance, education, culture, military affairs, and national defense were passed successively, all of which are resolutions that meet the new needs of the stage of the War of Resistance and nation-building. Among them, what is particularly noteworthy is that the first is the passage of the "Supporting the National Policy of War of Resistance" proposed by Chu Fucheng and other 24 people, Wang Zhuoran and other 25 people, and Lin Zuhan and other 21 people, and the resolution solemnly stated: "The established policy of War of Resistance must be supported to the end. All the people of the country should sincerely support the government and implement the second phase of the National Policy of War of Resistance. The government should order the military and civilians of the country to follow the great righteousness declared by Chairman Chiang in his declaration on December 26th last year, resolutely and thoroughly to recover our territorial, sovereign, and administrative integrity, and to complete the great cause of War of Resistance and nation-building." This resolution is a re-expression of the common demand of the people of the country, and it is also an expression of the support of the people of the country for all the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party, which is certainly a powerful blow to the × people, traitors, pro-Japanese, anti-communist, and peace-seeking elements. Second, regarding internal affairs, the "Implementing Selection of the Wise and Able and Purifying Officialdom" and "Strengthening the Implementation of the Three Principles of the People, Giving Full Play to Public Opinion to Benefit the War of Resistance" were passed; regarding economy and finance, the "Establishing Wartime Economic Policies to Benefit the War of Resistance and Maintain the People's Livelihood" was passed; regarding education and culture, the "Emergency Rescue of Youth in the Occupied Areas," "Eradicating Traitorous Writings," "Cultivating Border Affairs Talents," "Communicating Emotions Among Ethnic Groups and Building Special Education for Mongolia, Hui, and Tibet," and "Mobilizing Intellectuals Across the Country to Eradicate Illiteracy" were passed. Regarding military affairs and national defense, the "Expanding Air Force Establishment" was passed, which not only conforms to the basic principles of the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session but also supplements what the Fifth Plenary Session had not discussed or resolved, which has great significance for the future of the War of Resistance and nation-building. Third, the organization of a special committee to review the implementation of the resolutions of the first and second meetings shows that the association represents the national will, and the government's submission of the "First Phase of Wartime Administrative Plan" and the "Amendment to the Military Service Law" shows that the government respects the association, which occupies the most glorious page in the history of democratic politics in our country, making people feel great excitement.

3.  The Struggle Between Two Fronts

From the resolutions of this参政会, we can see how Chinese politics has embarked on a path of rapid progress! However, China is China of the world, and today's united front of the War of Resistance and nation-building in China is a main force on the world's anti-fascist and anti-aggression democratic peace front. Its progress will immediately affect the world, and the world's dynamics will directly and indirectly affect our great cause of anti-resistance and nation-building.

The struggle between the international democratic peace front and the fascist aggression front has also become more evident this week. First, let us talk about our common × people's fascist aggression front. They are launching more astonishing adventures and challenges under the compromise diplomatic policies of the British and French rulers. The Italian aggressors have already unofficially announced their new demands, namely: (1) The Italian population is increasing sharply, and it is necessary to colonize the French protectorate of Tunisia; (2) Italy, as a great empire, should "participate" in the management of the Suez Canal; (3) Gibraltar should be part of Italian North Africa. The German aggressors are preparing for new adventures, and propaganda for "new demands" has spread all over the world. The Eastern robber Japan's fascists are trying to strengthen the Japan-Germany-Italy anti-communist group, and sent secret envoys to Europe last week. Their spy agencies and diplomats in Europe are also secretly active in concluding anti-communist and anti-Soviet military alliances. In addition to attacking Hainan Island, they have further bombed Shenluo Lake on the Sino-British border; and with the assassination of Chen Lu, the foreign minister of the puppet维新 government, in the Shanghai concession on the 19th of this month, they are preparing to seize the Shanghai concession by force, which is a sign that the Japanese aggressors are carrying out a Far East adventure. On the democratic peace countries' side, although there has been no major change in the attitude of the British and French rulers, and they are even preparing to formally recognize the Spanish army and the pseudo-national army government in order to obtain some concessions from the Italian and German aggressors and temporarily delay the outbreak of the European war; however, the anti-appeasement policy and anti-fascist aggression movement in England and France have developed further and reached the stage of practical action. The broad masses of workers and various progressive parties and progressive justice figures are also launching a struggle against fascism and anti-compromise within the ruling class. This struggle is promoting England and France to move towards closer cooperation and to consolidate the united front of democratic peace countries. In the United States, anti-Roosevelt elements continue to be attacked throughout the United States, and reactionary theories have not been effective. On the morning of the 18th, Roosevelt loudly attacked fascist aggressors at the Golden Gate Exposition, calling on democratic peace forces to unite and sanction common × people. The Soviet Union's national defense and military affairs continue to develop rapidly, and new commercial treaties have been concluded with Lithuania and Poland in diplomacy. A new Soviet-British commercial treaty is also under negotiation. Today (February 23), the 21st anniversary of the Soviet Red Army, will be publicized everywhere, showcasing the heroic deeds and all the strength of the Red Army and the Soviet Union's naval and air forces. Factories, schools, and collective farms will establish technical groups for practicing shooting and other skills, and they will swear: to defend the socialist ancestral homeland of the Soviet Union, to defend the liberation of all nations in the world, and to fight to the death against fascist aggression! This is the glory and greatness of our friendly country, which will make us feel a huge thrill and the belief in victory in the process of our great cause of War of Resistance and nation-building. Although the aggression front is preparing for greater adventures, and the war will inevitably have a wider and more brutal performance, the democratic peace front has also been expanded. We must intensify our own efforts, accelerate the promotion and realization of the anti-fascist united front of the working people of the world, and move towards the path of victory.

### Two Hopes for the National Political Council; Opening Ceremony of the Third National Political Council; Original Text of Chairman Chiang's Speech

[Chongqing Dispatch] The National Political Council held its third general assembly today. I, Zhongzheng, acting under the government's mandate, have come to assume the chairmanship of this council. Before all the wise and experienced leaders of the nation, I feel deeply inadequate and apprehensive. However, with the nation in such dire straits, and with all of you gentlemen exhibiting such sincerity and traveling great distances to address the national crisis together, I am truly moved. Since you have all come with a spirit of responsibility and dedication, I dare not but encourage myself to be single-minded in purpose, and faithful in action. I hope that in this session, I will have the opportunity to listen to your profound insights, and I am willing to work with all of you to fulfill the mission of resisting the war and building the nation.

Although this council has only been established for eight months, it has already made significant contributions to the nation. During the two previous sessions, you have all put forward many constructive suggestions on a variety of current domestic and foreign affairs issues. Two things, in particular, I cannot forget:

First, it is the resolutions passed by the council in its previous two sessions to uphold national policy. In the first session, the council passed a resolution supporting the "Guiding Principles for Resisting the War and Building the Nation," and in the second session, it passed the "Resolution on Upholding the National Policy of Sustained Resistance." These two resolutions not only unified the hearts of the people across the country, united the national will, and strengthened the government and the people, but also clarified international perceptions and eliminated the enemy's attempts at spreading rumors and sowing discord, and their schemes and machinations to oppress us spiritually. This is most gratifying. Second, besides actively participating in the meetings, many councilors have also engaged in practical work for resisting the war and building the nation outside the council. Whether in the war zones or in the rear, our councilors have achieved admirable results through their courageous and arduous efforts, inspiring the people nationwide to know that we not only contribute opinions, but also dare to put them into practice. In particular, many councilors have taken great pains to personally inspect military discipline in the front lines and to comfort the soldiers fighting at the front, enduring injuries but never losing spirit, which is truly admirable.

Now the war of resistance has entered its second phase, and the responsibilities of our national government and people are even greater; the responsibilities of this council are also correspondingly increased. The first phase of the war of resistance laid the foundation for victory; the task of the second phase of the war of resistance is to concentrate and unleash all our strength in the rear and even in the occupied areas, to strive for the final victory and the success of nation-building. In the first phase of the war of resistance, both spiritual and material aspects were emphasized; in the second phase, the importance of the spirit is even greater than that of material. To unleash the power of resistance, we must not only boost our spirits and concentrate our minds, but also prioritize the spirit and use material resources accordingly. We must first enhance the strong and striving spirit of the people nationwide, and then we can overcome difficulties, defeat the enemy, and complete the mission of resisting the war. After the war of resistance entered its second phase, the enemy has become bogged down in a military quagmire, becoming more and more desperate and at a loss day by day. Recently, the enemy has emphasized political maneuvering, fabricating facts, and sowing discord among our people, all in an attempt to subdue our spirits first, break down our morale, and then conquer our entire nation. To break this conspiracy, in addition to constantly focusing on military and material resources, we must pay special attention to spiritual resistance; we should not only mobilize all domestic material and human resources, but also mobilize the nation's spirit and will; not only ignite the nation's spirit, but also organize the already ignited spirit. By using organized spirit to unleash organized manpower and utilize organized material resources, we can then eradicate the aggressive tyranny and establish a permanent foundation for nation-building after the war. This task, this mission, is undoubtedly the most arduous and greatest in Chinese history. The Provisional National Congress resolved last year to convene the National Political Council, aiming to concentrate the nation's strength to overcome the unprecedented national crisis and gather the national will to establish a foundation for nation-building. We can say that the greatest contribution of the National Political Council to the nation lies in promoting our nationally unified spirit and enhancing our inherent national morality. The resonance of this spirit and morality reaches directly to every province and county, directly to the cultural economy, every profession, and every sector of the population, which can inspire a spirit of shared hatred and unwavering determination, and inspire the national people's confidence in the bright future of the nation. As this war of resistance enters its second phase, I believe that strengthening the spirit and concentrating the spirit, using our words and actions to lead a national spiritual mobilization, should be the central focus of this session.

To concentrate the spirit of the people, we must enable the people nationwide to establish a common moral standard for themselves and to firmly believe in a common belief in the nation. And every member can strive, struggle, and sacrifice based on this common moral concept and common national belief. What is this common morality? It is "sacrificing the individual for the greater good." What is our common belief? It is the Three Principles of the People. What is the goal we are trying to achieve based on this belief? It is our Chinese political ideal, the world of Great Harmony. The Book of Rites says:

"When the Great Way prevails, the world is for all. The virtuous and capable are selected, and sincerity is cultivated, and harmony is promoted. Therefore, people do not only care for their own parents, nor do they only cherish their own children. The elderly are provided for, the strong are employed, the young are nurtured, and the widows, orphans, the disabled, and the sick are all cared for. Men have their proper roles, and women have their homes. People detest wasting resources, but do not necessarily hoard them for themselves... They detest not using their strength, but only for their own benefit. Therefore, conspiracies are suppressed and do not arise, and thieves and rebels do not appear."

This is our goal for nation-building. Only when we achieve this goal can the people nationwide enjoy true happiness, and only then can the Three Principles of the People be truly realized. Gentlemen, today we are fighting the war, shedding blood and sweat, and at the same time, we are exhausting our ingenuity to build the nation. The new nation that our leader Sun Yat-sen wanted to build is to achieve the Great Harmony described in the Book of Rites. The three points mentioned in the declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session (1) Sincerity and purity, strengthening unity; (2) Contributing abilities and free lives to the nation's active struggle; (3) Concentrating all time and energy to carry out psychological construction, political construction, and economic construction - this is of course for the war of resistance, but also for nation-building. What we focus on is not only the present, but also the distant future. Since our Chinese ideal for nation-building is "everyone not being selfish with their strength, not being selfish with themselves, working hard together, and living in peace and happiness," our starting point must be sincerity and purity, being on the same wavelength, sharing interests, and truly achieving the world as one community. Our efforts must be proactive, not passive. At the same time, to increase our strength, we must accelerate the implementation of all construction related to nation-building. The declaration of the Fifth Plenary Session not only hopes that all party members will do so, but especially hopes that all compatriots, especially national social leaders, will unanimously accept and implement it. All of you councilors are social leaders with knowledge and experience. On the one hand, the government is using the sincerity of "selecting the virtuous and capable" to concentrate national talent to jointly shoulder the responsibility of the nation. At the same time, it hopes to use the four words "cultivate sincerity and harmony" as the basis for uniting national strength. Therefore, what we sincerely hope from all councilors is that we first establish mutual trust and shared faith, be open and honest with each other, and treat each other with harmony and kinship, as if we were brothers. There is nothing that cannot be said directly, and there is no time when we cannot understand each other. On the one hand, we want you to gather public opinion as much as possible, truly represent public opinion, and fully express public opinion, knowing everything and saying everything, so that the government and society can fully understand each other, be in harmony, and have no stagnation. On the other hand, we hope that you will use your broad and compassionate minds to implement what our ancestors called "not only caring for their own parents, not only cherishing their own children," integrating the interests of one person, one family, one village, and one locality into the interests of the whole nation and the entire nation. We must extend the heart of loving our own family to respecting the elderly, caring for the poor, and helping our suffering compatriots, solving the national crisis. We must extend the heart of loving our own children to caring for the youth of the whole country, protecting the youth of the country, giving them good role models, and guiding them to the path of sincerity, purity, and common struggle for the country, to consolidate the long-term life of our nation. If our councilors can lead the nation with this spirit, I dare say, "The war of resistance will surely be victorious, the nation-building will surely be successful, and the ultimate goal of the Three Principles of the People, the world of Great Harmony, will surely be realized."

To specifically explain my personal hopes, I will not hesitate to reiterate two points of view: I believe that after these two points are fully achieved, the contribution of our National Political Council to the current war of resistance and nation-building will be even greater; our spirit of jointly overcoming national difficulties will be even more prominent and bright, and the spirit of our national sages, capable people, and leaders will be uplifted. By opening up the will of the government and the people, and concentrating the strength of the government and the people, this kind of effect is more than ten times greater than improving the spirit of officers and soldiers on the front lines to dare to sacrifice. What are the two hopes I am talking about?

First, this session must fully demonstrate an active spirit. The emergence of our National Political Council is different from the parliament of a normal country. Our organizational spirit, the environment in which we were established, and the process we went through are all unprecedented in the political history of the world. And the achievements of our past two sessions, which have tried our best to avoid the accumulated habits of ordinary parliaments, are even more something we can be proud of in the world. Now the work of resisting the war and building the nation is even more urgent. In order to save time and increase efficiency, I believe that we must further reduce unimportant proposals as much as possible and devote ourselves more to active, constructive, and practical suggestions and discussions. I remember that in the last session, we discussed the draft review method for a long time, wasting precious time during the war of resistance. Today, you must all understand very well that our government is a revolutionary government, a responsible government, and a government that fully relies on public opinion and justice. As long as it does not violate the interests of resisting the war and building the nation, the government has no reason to restrict the rights of the people. Therefore, our councilors do not need to think too much about personal convenience and freedom, which may lead to neglecting the overall interests of the country. Today, we must maximize our proactivity and avoid the passivity that we have been deeply influenced by for thousands of years. Our past national characteristics, such as suspicion, friction, prevention, and confrontation, are all biased towards passivity, which not only cannot promote all undertakings, but also consumes a lot of useful energy, hinders a lot of progress, and even delays national affairs. We only see the demise of the Song and Ming dynasties, which was not due to the helplessness of the military, nor was it absolutely devoid of sages among our people, but simply because everyone cherished their own opinions, established their own factions, was selfish, and had different opinions, which made it impossible to unify the spirit and thus dispersed the will and strength. Looking at the partial interests, it was higher than the national interests. For personal freedom, the freedom of the country was sacrificed, so in the end, it caused the "discussion to be unfinished

### Under the Leadership of Chairman Chiang, the National Political Council Successfully Opened; Resolutions Submitted to the Government for Adoption; National Defense Committee Works Intensely

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, Our Newspaper, 22nd] After the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council, it actively discussed the overall plans for resisting the war and building the nation, as well as the affairs of the Party, government, and military, and distributed them to the relevant parties for implementation. Currently, all our work in the front and rear is extremely intense, and the hope for the future of the country is extremely high. It is reported that the resolutions passed by the National Political Council have also been submitted to the National Defense Council for reference and adoption. At the moment, the formations of each battlefield are becoming more solid, and the training and replenishment of the troops are being carried out diligently according to the established plan. The military future is very optimistic.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] The Second Session of the National Political Council was held on the 12th. A total of nine general assemblies were held, and more than eighty resolutions were passed. The process was good, and the results were very satisfactory. The closing ceremony was held at 10:00 am on the 21st after the ninth meeting. The presidents of the two houses, Mr. Ju and Mr. Yu, the vice president, Zhang Qun, etc., Central Committee members Ye Chu-cang and Wu Tie-cheng, etc., and councilors Zhong Rongguang, Hu Wotan, etc., totaled one hundred thirty-eight people. Chairman Chiang led the ceremony as usual, and then delivered a closing speech. After the speech, the audience applauded enthusiastically. Then Vice Chairman Zhang and Councilor Representative Zhang Lin gave speeches, which were welcomed with applause. The meeting then adjourned. The proceedings were solemn and important. The closing speech of Chairman Chiang is recorded as follows:

### Closing Speech by Chairman Chiang

Vice Chairman Zhang, fellow councilors: The third session of the National Political Council is held at the beginning of the second phase of the war of resistance. Both at home and abroad, people are paying close attention to the progress of our meeting. In the past few days, we have all discussed the major plans for the nation with an active spirit. I was fortunate to have my sincere expectations for this session accepted by everyone. The spirit of unity and harmony in this session can only be described by the idioms "gathering together" and "harmonious and respectful." Seeing this scene, I have even more confidence in the future of our nation and the victory of the war of resistance. I am truly gratified.

Although the General Assembly is Closed, Work Never Stops

During this meeting, on the one hand, the government and the responsible authorities of the ministries were able to frankly and fully report on the government's situation and gained our trust. At the same time, we were able to pay attention to the practical needs of the second phase of the war of resistance for all resolutions and suggestions, and concentrate on a few specific and constructive key points. The number of proposals is not large, but the content is very substantial. In particular, many colleagues, based on their experience in participating in the war of resistance, contributed many experiences they had gained, and put forward many practical opinions, which can benefit the implementation of the government. There is such good communication between our government and this council, sharing weal and woe, and I am confident that we will be able to shoulder the responsibility of resisting the war and building the nation, and fulfill our mission of resisting the war and building the nation.

Now the Third General Assembly has closed. Although the General Assembly is closed, the work of our colleagues to serve the country will not stop for a day. I believe that as long as this council can continue to promote this active spirit of mutual assistance, openly and honestly assist the government, and do what we do in a down-to-earth manner, not only will the government be able to obtain a lot of help, but it will also be able to make the people of the whole country accept this kind of emotion.

Unite and strive together to strengthen our power to defeat the enemy, and to establish the foundation for nation-building after the war.

Historical Mission of the Council: Establishing a Democratic Politics

In the history of China's political system, this council will certainly occupy a very important and glorious position. The historical mission of this council is to enrich the foundation of the Three People's Principles, especially to establish a permanent and true democratic political foundation. I already mentioned this point in my opening speech. The ultimate goal of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of the Three People's Principles, in particular the Principle of Democracy, is a democratic politics. If the people of a country cannot care about their own happiness and manage their own common affairs, that is to say, if the people cannot actively participate in politics, then they cannot create a strong country. Therefore, the most powerful and solid politics in the world must be built on public opinion, and must be based on the interests of the people. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal of democracy is to create a country that is of the people, by the people, and for the people. There is no difference between ancient and modern times, and between China and foreign countries.

Success in the War of Resistance and Nation-Building Depends on National Mobilization

We are now resisting the war and building the nation at the same time. To achieve victory in the war of resistance and success in nation-building, we must never rely solely on military force, but must mobilize the spirit of the people, organize the spirit of the people that has already been mobilized, and use the sum of the national spiritual will and strength as the backing of the soldiers on the front lines, and as the driving force for the development of the rear. Therefore, in addition to enriching military strength, it is necessary to mobilize the strength of the people, and it is even more necessary to conform to public opinion. The reason why the Provisional National Congress resolved to convene the National Political Council last year was that on the one hand, it hoped that the true public opinion of the country could be specifically expressed by our councilors, so that the government could understand the suffering of the people and know the hopes of the people, as a basis for implementing policies. At the same time, it also hoped that our councilors could use their status and prestige to participate in the major plans for resisting the war and building the nation on behalf of the people, and actively contribute our talents and experience to assist the government and guide the people. Then, every move of the government can be in line with the hearts of the people; every word and deed of the people can assist the government. The success or failure of the government is the success or failure of the people. The government and the people work together to cooperate. The war of resistance has the strength, and the wishes for comfort become effective. From the process of the formation of this council, we can know that whether China can defeat the enemy and achieve national independence and freedom is, of course, the responsibility of the colleagues of this council. In this aspect, whether China can be in this difficult time of the war of resistance. Creating a true democratic government model for the country and laying the foundation for long-term stability is even more the responsibility of our councilors.

### Using Terrorist Incidents as an Excuse, the Enemy Makes Demands on the Shanghai Concessions; Joint Conference of the Enemy's Navy and Army in Shanghai; Advisor to the Enemy's Embassy Flies to Tokyo for Instructions

[Dispatch from Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd] The "Hochi Shimbun" claimed today that the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Army held a meeting last night, instructing the Japanese authorities in Shanghai to demand that the concession authorities immediately arrest the murderers who assassinated Chen Lu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Puppet Restoration Government. The newspaper also said, "The Japanese authorities in Shanghai will also arrest other terrorists and take necessary steps to prevent future terrorist incidents from happening. If terrorist incidents continue to occur and the terrorists are still not arrested, the Japanese authorities in Shanghai will notify the concession authorities that the Japanese government believes that the concession authorities cannot maintain order, and Japan will take appropriate steps within the concessions to maintain order, and if necessary, will even use force to defend itself."

[Dispatch from Shanghai, 22nd] According to a message from the Japanese news agency Domei, Japanese naval and army officers and diplomats in Shanghai gathered at the Izumo warship yesterday afternoon to discuss the overall situation in Shanghai in detail. After three hours of consultation, they agreed to adopt a "tough stance" and "effective methods to deal with any emergency," and claimed that "in order to maintain the safety and order of the concessions, they will do their best to eliminate anti-Japanese elements."

[Dispatch from the Associated Press, Shanghai, 22nd] A Japanese spokesman said that the heads of the Japanese army and navy and the consuls visited Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Public Works Department, and the commanders of the British and French garrisons today to make demands, but the content was not announced.

[Dispatch from the Associated Press, Shanghai, 22nd] After the news that the Japanese side will make tough demands due to the continuous occurrence of terrorist incidents, US Navy Commander MacLeans has ordered the suspension of routine exercises to prevent any emergencies.

[Dispatch from the Associated Press, Shanghai, 20th] Mr. Mori Shigeru, an advisor to the Japanese Embassy, flew to Tokyo by plane this morning to ask the government for instructions on how to deal with the overall situation in Shanghai.

### Searching Western Shanghai; Puppet Police Shot

[Dispatch from the Associated Press, Shanghai, 22nd] This morning, more than 800 British, Italian, and Japanese troops and inspectors from the Public Works Department conducted a strict search for terrorists in areas adjacent to the Japanese-occupied areas, but found nothing.

[Dispatch from the Associated Press, Shanghai, 20th] A joint search team of public concession inspectors and puppet Dadao police officers searched the Nissho Gongda cotton mill today and arrested five suspected terrorists. The two sides exchanged fire, and one Dadao puppet policeman and one Chinese inspector were wounded. All five terrorists escaped.

### The Enemy's House of Representatives; Emergency Interrogation

[Foreign Dispatch from Tokyo, 22nd] Due to the proposal of an emergency interrogation regarding the Shanghai terrorist incidents, the House of Representatives meeting on the 21st was extremely tense before the meeting. All cabinet members from Hiranuma onwards, as well as all members of the Seiyukai and other parties, attended. The visitors' seats were also full. After the meeting was opened at 1:02 pm, the agenda was changed. First, Mr. Koyama Tani (Minseito) raised an emergency question regarding the maintenance of security in Shanghai. Prime Minister Hiranuma promised a fundamental solution. Then, Foreign Minister Arita explained in detail the negotiations with the Public Works Department. It is not easy to increase the number of Japanese police officers in the concessions. Although negotiations are still underway, local officials have been instructed to take appropriate measures. In any case, it seems that it is necessary to fundamentally reconsider the methods of maintaining security in the concessions due to the continuous occurrence of terrorist incidents. Regarding the activation of the right of self-defense, I am confident that it will not be obstructed by any party. Next, Navy Minister Yonai answered the questions, and Army Minister Itagaki also said, "Although the concession authorities have made various excuses for the terrorist incidents, in my opinion, it is not so much that they lack the ability to maintain security, but rather that they lack the sincerity to maintain security. If the concession authorities do not think of improving the current situation, and this continues in the long run, we will have to consider appropriate and effective measures for self-defense." After the major officials expressed the Empire's "resolute determination" and direction, the emergency interrogation was concluded.

### Two Hopes for the Political Participation Council – Continued from the Second Edition

, the tragic scene of "the enemy has crossed the river." Today, we must set a good example for all the people of the country and for future generations. We must replace negativity with positivity, destructive criticism with constructive proposals, and suspicion and rejection with mutual assistance and unity. Therefore, the work of this session should focus on suggesting practical plans and methods for the later stages of the war of resistance, and should especially promote the spirit of loyalty to the country and joint resistance against foreign aggression. All discussions and suggestions should be infused with a positive spirit.

Second, this session of the conference must fully promote the spirit of sincerity, purity, mutual trust, and shared belief. The country has reached such a state, and we sit idly by without saving it. Who will save it if we don't? The interests of the nation, if we do not love and support them, who will? We must integrate the individual and the nation into one. The strength of the individual must become the strength of the nation, and the will of the individual must submit to the will of the nation. Only when the nation gains freedom can the individual truly enjoy freedom. We must all put the interests of the nation first, and extend this to others, believing that the citizens of the Republic of China all have a patriotic conscience. With shared belief, there will be mutual trust. How can we achieve sincerity and purity? Sacrificing for the sake of the nation is sincerity; having no other distractions besides the nation is purity. We would not hesitate to die for the nation, let alone other things; we all stand united in the interests of the nation, officials should propagate for the nation, actions should be for the nation, and even thoughts should be for the nation. We must make sincere efforts, but we must strive purely for the sake of the nation, towards people and towards things. We must absolutely trust each other, and then we can generate a common force to deal with the common enemy, and accomplish our common aspirations. Responsible personnel in the government now would not work so hard and endure so much hardship if it were not for the future of the nation. You would not be working so hard to share the national crisis if it were not for the future of the nation. Therefore, the government and our Political Participation Council have a consistent understanding and a consistent goal. We have a shared belief in the future of the nation, and we have mutual trust in each other. This can break down all barriers, eliminate all prejudices, and achieve sincerity, seeking truth from facts, working together in harmony, and helping each other in times of crisis. As long as we rely on this spirit, any difficulty can be overcome, and anything can be achieved.

The two points I have contributed above are very ordinary, but the hopes are very sincere. Since the beginning of the war of resistance, I, Zhongzheng, have shouldered a heavy responsibility, and my spirit and determination have been connected with all my colleagues. Now that I have assumed the position of Chairman of this Council, I will have more opportunities to interact with you all, and we can further work together with one heart and one mind, and learn from each other. I feel inspired and honored to be jointly responsible with you in this great mission of resisting the enemy and building the nation. I only worry about my own foolishness and clumsiness, and fear that I will not be able to live up to the expectations of my colleagues. In the future, if I, Zhongzheng, have any shortcomings, or any errors or mistakes, or if my words and deeds are inconsistent, or if I am not sincere or truthful, and cannot fulfill my duties, I hope that you will not hesitate to teach me and correct me at any time, so as not to fail in my duties. I, Zhongzheng, only have this piece of foolish loyalty and sincere devotion to the nation, and I am willing to share difficulties and honors with everyone, with one heart and one mind, from beginning to end, to fulfill our mission of resisting the enemy and building the nation, and to meet the expectations of the government and the people of the whole country.

### A General by Dongting Lake

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya

Taking the Yuehan Railway northeastward from Zhuzhou, the weather was still warm during the day, but it became surprisingly cold at night, so cold that it was impossible to doze off for even a moment. But when I thought of the soldiers at the front, who, regardless of day or night, rain or snow, cold or hunger, had to lie in the trenches and fight bitterly, a fire seemed to start in my heart, burning so that my whole body became warm and sweat flowed down my back.

Changsha, the city of fire, is almost a month ago now, but the people in the car are still chattering about it endlessly, perhaps as a reflection of the great trauma and pain. After a while, the car arrived in Changsha. To go north, we had to change cars again. The weather was surprisingly cold at night. In not much time, the military tents, stones, rooftops, and distant broken walls, ruins, plains, etc. at Changsha Station were all covered with a layer of crystal-clear, shimmering white snow.

From some broken walls and ruins, a few flashes of fire occasionally appeared, dimly lit. We knew that it must be people awakened by the cold snow and the piercing wind, taking their remaining beams and rafters or pulling out the rice straw they were curled up on and burning a fire to keep warm. In addition, from the wreckage of that vast sea of fire, gusts of smoke and stench were blown by the cold wind, quietly and unconsciously entering my nostrils. It was best to ignore it and let it pass. If you were to evaluate the taste and trace the cause, it would definitely make you feel extremely sad.

The train hoped to arrive in Miluo early tomorrow morning. It had already eaten its fill of coal and drank its fill of water. After the passengers had roughly mourned the disaster area of Changsha in the snowy night, as if it wanted to identify the culprit, it immediately shouted loudly a few times and pulled us towards the * direction.

The train arrived at its destination on time. After getting off the train, I inquired at the ×× Department Liaison Station about the troops and the route I was going to find. Only then did I learn that General Luo Zhuoying, the first person I wanted to find, had unfortunately gone to ×× place that day. At that time, it gave me an idea: "He went to ×× place. The rumor in Changsha that he will concurrently serve as the Chairman of ×× Province is probably only a matter of time, right?" Secondly, not far from here in ×× place, General Guan ××min, commander of the ×× Army Group, was still stationed there. I had interviewed Guan when he was fighting at Gubeikou of the Great Wall in the past. Now I will meet him again on the battlefield, which really makes me very excited!

I called him first, and he agreed to send an adjutant to lead the way. The ditches were crisscrossed, the fields were fertile, and the wheat leaves and bean flowers were green and white. The adjutant said casually that he had only returned from the front line of * qiang River three days ago. The battle there was still raging. The * people first oppressed us across the Henan, but we also pushed dozens of miles north, and took the points they were stubbornly holding one by one. Their troops are weak, and their fighting spirit is lost. They only know how to lurk in bunkers and fire guns and cannons indiscriminately, like turtles shrinking their heads, and there is no chance to find them to kill them happily. From this point of view, the battle situation in the northern section of the Yuehan Railway has obviously become a stalemate in which we have a slight advantage. That's right, when I saw Commander Guan later, he also believed that the current situation was like this.

Since the beginning of the war of resistance, Guan has repeatedly made contributions in various battles in the north and south and has endured many hardships. However, his full spirit and fat body are still the same as when we met in the past. He first answered the reporter's questions about the battle situation amicably, then stood up, pointed to the military map hanging on the wall, and started talking about the counterattack battles from Xinqiang, Matang, and other places east of Dongting Lake. How smoothly we advanced, how we regained many trophies. Then he moved his finger, drew an arc downwards to the right through Yueyang, Linxiang, Tongcheng and other places, and then pointed to Pingjiang and said, "* The army suffered a setback when it went south from the north of Yueyang, and then tried to detour around us through this route. However, we also had a strong deployment on the Pingjiang route, causing them to suffer a serious blow. Although they are now launching large-scale offensives against our northwest and southwest, their troops are insufficient and they cannot take care of everything, so the war in central China is gradually becoming silent, and we are given the opportunity to take advantage of the weakness. This is an irreparable flaw in the second phase of the * people's war of aggression, and at the same time, it is one of the many superior conditions that we must have in the first phase of the war of resistance."

"The bloody lessons and the iron-like results we have obtained from the third stage (battle) of the first phase (strategy) of the war of resistance are all contributing to our second phase—that is, moving towards victory from the war of resistance." He was like a great orator standing on the podium. Once the topic was announced, he won thunderous applause, and he talked endlessly.

"We must recognize what the results of the third stage of the first phase have achieved. That is, actively luring * into a wider range of comprehensive battles and longer-term protracted wars. * people suffer inevitable defeat. Specifically, the * people's strategic policy of quick battles and quick decisions was first broken by our fists, and then their attempts to carry out annihilation battles were broken one by one. Once the geographical situation is special in the future, it is even more impossible to seek annihilation battles completely. Recently, the * people have repeatedly released the atmosphere of quick peace and quick conclusion, and their inner anxiety has already been seen in their words, but they have still been refuted by our highest leader without any integrity and completely rejected. It burned the flames of war in advance, and seeing that the general situation was unfavorable, it wanted to cut off its own lifeline and induce the other party to dissolve it. Of course, it can only pretend to be fat by swelling its face and defend its face from a military point of view.

"It came from afar across the ocean. In the first phase of the operation, it had a hundred times more difficulties than us in terms of major advantages and various living habits. Now the war zone is even more expanded, and its difficulties will inevitably increase, forcing it to take risks and not know its own death?"

"As for our war affairs and tactics, there have been significant improvements. Now we are doing our best to exploit our strengths and attack the * people's weaknesses, firmly establish the belief that we will win, and promote the spirit of deep entry into the * people's camp. The people's hearts are becoming more and more energetic, the morale is becoming more and more heroic, there is no worry about replenishing soldiers, there should be no lack of military resources, and the international situation is increasingly favorable to us. These many subjective and objective conditions are all to promote our progress towards victory."

——In Guan's conversation, his observations on the future situation between * and us were purely based on facts and the insightful arguments of accurate analysis. Let us try to think calmly, in the first phase of the war of resistance, why were there so many traitors captured in the front and rear, like cattle hair? Why are the front-line generals who violate their duties innumerable? However, in the current second phase of the war of resistance, such heartbreaking leaks have visibly decreased, and it can even be hoped that they will continue to decrease. This is the example of "a nation's awareness of the war is becoming more and more progressive, and the soldiers are becoming more and more heroic" that Guan pointed out. Guan bravely fought in northern Hunan this time, preventing the * from advancing southward. A gentleman intends to give a poem with the line, "Do not teach * * * to pasture in the south, a general by Dongting Lake," which can truly be a portrait of Guan's brilliant achievements.

### * Casualties on Hainan Island Nearly 10,000; Bloody Battles Repeatedly Fought in Lu, Ji, and Yu Provinces

The Battle of Dongjiang Suddenly Tightens; Bao'an Nantou Recaptured

The * then increased to two thousand. Because of the disparity in numbers, we abandoned Meishan. The houses there were all burned down.

(Special dispatch from our newspaper in Chongqing on the 22nd) Jinkou, a vital town in the southwest of Wuchang, was captured by us on the 20th. The * were caught off guard and retreated to Wuchang.

The * in North China attempted to eliminate our guerrillas in various provinces. Since the situation between Su and Japan has become tense, even if the * have this intention, they are already powerless, he said.

[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Chongqing on the 22nd] The battle situation in Zhongtiao Mountain is silent. The * attempted to invade west from Hejin, but it is difficult to realize due to the river water not freezing. There are only guerrilla battles between Xinjiang and Houma.

### British Prime Minister Reports: Military Expansion Will Not Be Relaxed; National Defense Work Has Been Effective; Britain and France Discuss Wartime Missions

[Reuters, London, 21st] The British House of Commons today continued the debate on national defense. Prime Minister Chamberlain said, "I have seen the strong feeling of controversy disappear. Members of the entire House have deeply understood the realistic situation and the necessity of the armament plan, as well as the method of financial management. Recalling that the Labor Party insisted on the policy of collective security and international basis last year, they now rely on the power of the League of Nations. Under the current circumstances, it is ineffective. Therefore, we are now taking other methods to maintain peace and the security of our country. The Labor Party's opinion that destroying the Union is inappropriate. Future historians will be able to understand that the sacrifices made by Britain for international efforts are greater than the sacrifices of any country. The League of Nations cannot implement the policy of sanctions, which is not Britain's fault, nor is it the fault of other countries. The real reason is that the work we have given it is beyond its ability." Referring to yesterday's speech by Finance Minister Simon, Chamberlain said, "Sir Simon said that national defense expenses can be borne separately by the country's income and borrowing, so the implementation of national defense is obviously vigorous. After a long period of effort, preparation, and organization, the national defense plan has begun to produce visible results. We all know that in the past few months, the production of various munitions and machinery has increased significantly. Our labor will soon get the rewards it deserves." Chamberlain then discussed domestic defense, saying, "Although the progress of domestic defense is slightly slow, under the guidance of Sir Anderson, various measures have been completed one after another, and soon there will be results as we hoped." Chamberlain praised Lord Chatfield extremely, saying that he is very suitable for the work of talent and defense adjustment. "Mr. Morrison was appointed as Lord Chatfield's representative in the House of Commons. This move does not mean that Morrison is a minister of the supply department. The production of munitions, especially aircraft and other aviation department items, has greatly increased, which shows the wisdom of the government not appointing a minister of supply. As for finance, I don't know if this hospital has realized the importance of the national expenditure that should be investigated here. If our military expansion plan is finally completed, then we need to take further actions, not only for our loans, we need to pay interest, but also for the increased troops, we need to have annual maintenance fees. According to the Ministry of Finance's budget, next year's military expansion expenses are expected to be allocated 230 million pounds from the national income, which is a serious phenomenon that no one can ignore. I do not intend to mention how to solve this problem. If we allow this phenomenon to continue to develop without thinking about ways to stop it, it is no different from committing a crime. Yesterday, someone gave a speech advocating convening a world military accommodation meeting. If I believe that this conference can produce effective results, I will not hesitate to convene it immediately. Unfortunately, the time is not yet ripe, and it is difficult to hold this meeting at present. I have never believed that my political enemies have the intention of carrying out war, but I believe that the policies they are pursuing may cause war. Although our military equipment is huge, this is the military equipment for national defense. If other countries are as unaggressive as our country, then our promotion of military equipment is due to mutual misunderstanding. I believe that we cannot relax on the matter of military expansion, but if all countries are willing to implement disarmament, we are also willing to follow suit. If all countries continue to expand their military, then a total collapse will be inevitable." Labor Party leader Attlee replied to this speech, accusing the Prime Minister of shameful gains, saying, "Chamberlain should have shown his enthusiasm for appeasement and disarmament seven years ago. We really need a true Minister of National Defense. Last year's events have destroyed the balance of power, and Britain has fallen from collective security to isolation. Have the talks between Britain and the Soviet Union on stabilizing the world situation already been held? The feeling in all circles is very dark, because the people believe that the Prime Minister has sacrificed the most important moral principles. This does not mean that the Prime Minister will cause war, but that the Prime Minister should advance with freedom, democracy, and the law. The general feeling is that the Prime Minister is in league with illegal aggression and totalitarianism." Churchill continued Attlee's speech, saying, "The current time is a period of bloodless war. The British people hope that this war will never be bloody, and that true peace will be achieved in the end. The current transitional period is unprecedented in British history. In order to realize the hopes of the British people, it is important that all the strength of Britain should be used as much as possible, so it is right to use British credit as a powerful weapon. Britain does not want to exaggerate, but in fact, whether it is in finance or other aspects, Britain's strength is very strong. Next year will be a year of great increase in national defense strength, and Britain's aircraft factories will produce a large number of aircraft that only Germany can achieve." Morrison, the House of Commons spokesman for Defense Adjustment Minister Lord Chatfield, replied on behalf of the government, "We are taking huge national defense steps, not because we think there is an unavoidable war. We know that the government cannot implement the principle of limited liability once a war occurs. Our resources are all related to the war. What we should be concerned about now is the preparation for the early stages of the war. The government is willing to assure the people that the British and French staff departments have begun talking about the two countries' tasks in the event of a future war. Our plan should be practical and complete, and manpower, munitions, and all military supplies should be linked to each other, and each should have an appropriate place."

[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] According to inquiries, the French authorities, in view of Italy's increasing troops in Libya to 65,000, are preparing for contingencies and have increased troops by 5,000 in Gibraltar, and proposed to hold a military meeting with the British to discuss the European situation. If the British agree, it is expected to be held on Saturday or Sunday. According to the Gibraltar police report, foreign spies have been found to be active everywhere recently.

### United States and Brazil Discuss Economic Agreement

[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 22nd] The content of the economic agreement between the United States and Brazil, originally scheduled to be announced today (Wednesday), has been extended indefinitely. It is heard that difficulties have arisen in the negotiations with the other party, but the State Department and the Brazilian government both refuse to make any announcements. According to the Brazilian side, Foreign Minister Aranha has proposed the Brazilian opinion to all parties concerned and is waiting for a reply, but political circles here say that the State Department and the Ministry of Agriculture have differences over the amount of loans to Brazil, and it is expected that this matter will have to wait until President Roosevelt returns to Washington before a decision can be made. In addition, Brazil's newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Souza, will arrive in New York on Saturday or Sunday, and the Brazilian chargé d'affaires in Washington will go to New York to meet him. The new ambassador also received instructions from Foreign Minister Aranha to proceed to Washington immediately after arriving in New York to consult with the US authorities on the economic agreement.

### Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Message to Christians Around the World

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 22nd] Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek recently met with Dr. Tuck, Chairman of the North American Missionary Federation, and issued a message to Christians around the world, the content of which roughly stated that the material and spiritual assistance of Christians to our country's people has been obvious, and the missionaries are willing to sacrifice themselves to help those who are suffering. I believe that the struggle of our people in this suffering has made them gain a spiritual victory, laying the foundation for the victory of the war of resistance. Such facts can far prove that justice is stronger than power.

### Britain and the Netherlands Discussed Far East Defense

[Reuters, The Hague, 22nd] The Dutch authorities replied to the members of parliament in the parliament that the exchange of opinions between the British and Dutch governments on Far East defense was only of an ordinary technical nature. The broadcast of Russian and German news to the Dutch East Indies was also heatedly discussed in parliament. According to Dutch Governor-General Yi, the government is considering prohibiting the reception of foreign news.

### US Warships Conduct Exercises; Japanese Fishing Boats Follow and Spy; Secret Agents Are Studying How to Deal with It

[Associated Press, Los Angeles, 22nd] Federal government secret agents are now studying how to deal with the report that Japanese fishing boats have been secretly following the US fleet from Los Angeles to San Diego to the Caribbean exercise area. District Attorney Harrison announced that he had received information that a number of these fishing boats had appeared at the exercise site at the same time as the fleet. These fishing boats have never fished near that area before, and this is the first time, so it is especially worthy of attention. At the same time, it has been found that there are many Japanese fishing boats spying on the fleet's activities with telescopes.

### Spanish President, Rumors of Fatigue, Spanish Embassy in France Denies

[Halian Press, Paris, 22nd] Recently, rumors have been spreading that President Azaña is tired of his duties. The Spanish embassy here denies this, saying, according to Martín, that news of the Spanish president's resignation will soon be announced within 48 hours. France's recognition of the Franco government will become easy. Spanish Prime Minister Negrín will be forced to surrender. Also, the French government, due to the large expenses required to provide food to Spanish refugees, has requested that England, the United States, and the Soviet Union share the responsibility, as there are currently 400,000 refugees residing in French territory, costing approximately 3 million francs per day. The British and American governments have already agreed to provide assistance, but there has been no response from the Soviet Union. Furthermore, according to recent reports from Madrid, Spanish Prime Minister Negrín suddenly clashed with Member of Parliament Besteiro. Besteiro is very active in parliament and has recently advocated for unconditional surrender to General Franco, and it is rumored that he will send a nationwide telegram advocating for peace. It is also rumored that many Spanish political figures are preparing to elect Communist leader José Díaz Ramos as president to succeed Azaña, but one account states that Ramos has been "missing" since the fall of Catalonia. It is also rumored that the British Chargé d'Affaires in Spain is discussing surrender with Negrín and General Miaja to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. The Spanish Embassy in Paris issued a public statement denying that any Spanish leaders have such intentions. Also, French parliamentarian Bérard has not arrived in Spain, and meetings cannot be held for discussion. Most newspapers still advocate for the prompt recognition of the Franco government.

[Reuters, Rome, 23rd] The four countries of the Balkan Entente, Romania, Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia, have all agreed to legally recognize the Franco government.

[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] The French representative to the Franco government, Mr. Bérard, carrying new government instructions, has departed for Burgos to negotiate the exchange of diplomatic representatives with the rebels. The condition for France's legal recognition of the Franco government will not be a written guarantee, but only the rebels' verbal promise to permanently pursue an independent foreign policy and not to ally with totalitarian states. At the same time, Prime Minister Daladier will hold a cabinet meeting before the end of the week to decide on simultaneously announcing legal recognition of the Franco government with England and France.

### Anglo-German Economic Negotiations Scheduled for Mid-March

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen, an advisor to the British Foreign Office, arrived here from London on the 20th, presumably to begin Anglo-German economic negotiations. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop received him. Yesterday morning, Knatchbull-Hugessen had a long meeting with Dr. Wiehl, head of the German Foreign Office's economic department. It is reported that both sides are soliciting opinions from German industrialists and representatives of the British Industrial Federation, preparing to convene a meeting on March 25th. The German side will be represented by Dr. Poensgen, Chairman of the United Steel Works, representing the four major industries.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] Knatchbull-Hugessen of the British Foreign Office will remain in Berlin until Friday or Saturday. It is reported that in addition to meeting with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, he may also visit German Economics Minister Funk and General Göring, and hold talks with representatives of major industries, German banks, and private banks.

### Siamese Foreign Policy

[Reuters, London, 22nd] According to the "Manchester Guardian's" Singapore correspondent, "People returning from Bangkok say that the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Thomas Shenton Whitelegge Thomas, received a warm welcome during his visit to Siam, which is a manifestation of the friendly relations between Britain and Siam. In the past few years, Japan has made every effort to cultivate friendly relations with Siam. There have been no fewer than six or seven Japanese goodwill missions to Siam." Regarding Japan's desire to build a canal in Siam, the correspondent believes that it is practically impossible because the cost is enormous and far beyond Japan's capacity. The correspondent added that Siam's foreign policy is precisely to maintain an equal balance of power between England and France, and the power of Japan.

### New British Battleship, HMS King George V Launched, The King and Queen Attend in Person

[Reuters, London, 21st] The new British battleship "King George V" was launched this afternoon at the Walker Naval Yard here. The King and Queen attended in person. According to the Admiralty, the ship is 35,000 tons and will be the fastest in the British fleet, equipped with ten 14-inch guns and sixteen 5.25-inch guns. The ship also carries aircraft, and a crew and officers of approximately 1,500, and will serve as a flagship. The King was very pleased during the event and expressed satisfaction with the ship.

[Reuters, London, 21st] According to the "Daily Mail's" naval correspondent, contracts for the two battleships, "Lion" and "Temeraire," from the British 1938 naval program, have now been approved. Both ships are 40,000 tons and carry multiple 16-inch guns.

### Japan Experiencing a Severe Shortage of Military Supplies, Parliament Issues an Order Prohibiting Statistics, and Forbids the Publication of Meteorological Information

[Tokyo, 22nd] According to a report from the Japanese Domei News Agency, the Japanese Diet has recently issued the strictest prohibitions, forbidding the following statistics and information: 1. Prohibition of statistics on the transportation of military supplies to the Three Eastern Provinces and mandated territories; 2. Prohibition of statistics on the manufacture of military weapons; 3. Prohibition of statistics on the manufacture of military supplies; 4. Prohibition of disseminating statistics on military supply stockpiles; 5. Prohibition of statistics on the import of military supplies; 6. Prohibition of statistics on the number of military transports; 7. Prohibition of statistics on the tonnage of military transports; 8. Prohibition of statistics on military transport equipment; 9. Prohibition of compiling statistics on behalf of army and navy personnel; 10. Prohibition of meteorological information. From the above series of prohibitions, we can draw the following conclusions: 1. Japan's stockpile of military weapons and supplies is about to be exhausted; 2. The import of Japanese military weapons and supplies has sharply decreased; 3. The production of military weapons and supplies is dwindling; 4. Transport infrastructure is in disarray. In other words, Japan's predicament can be imagined.

### British Aid to China Fund Continues Fundraising, Swedish Doctor Hultman Will Come to China to Assist in Relief Efforts

Dr. Hultman is scheduled to depart for Hong Kong on the 25th of this month, and then proceed to China. He is carrying medical equipment worth 10,000 kronor (Swedish currency). The Swedish Parliament donated 128,500 kronor last year for Chinese refugee relief.

### Inflation Occurring in Japanese Currency

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Japan is currently implementing a thrift campaign, and the people are being forced to cut back on food and clothing to cope with the current difficulties.

### American President Actively Assists Democratic Countries, Strives to Save World Peace, Prevents Terrorist Control by Authoritarian Countries

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] People here have recently had differing opinions regarding American foreign policy. Isolationists and Republicans believe that the United States does not need to be involved in European disputes, so it should not comment on the policies of European countries. The President and those who support his new policies advocate actively assisting democratic countries. Both sides still express agreement with Chamberlain's policies, but those who support the President's policies further believe that if Chamberlain can have strength as a backing, the results will be better. They acknowledge that the world does need peace, but peace under terrorist control risks submerging Western democratic countries in the totalitarian misery of Europe, which is far from what America wants. They point out that President Roosevelt is working to save this kind of peace. Although Roosevelt's policies are currently met with both praise and criticism, the President's constitutional powers are extremely broad, and the opposing forces are far inferior to them.

### Britain Will Still Adopt a Compromise Approach, Mediate the Arab-Jewish Dispute

At the same time, the British government's talks with the Arab representatives have also come to an end. The government intends to adopt a compromise approach for mediation after consideration. If that is not possible, the British government will handle it.

### Fishery Treaty Issue, Soviet Union Does Not Pay Attention, Only a Chargé d'Affaires and a Secretary are Sent to Deal with It

Brief Commentary

### What After the Spring Festival?

The Spring Festival is the Lunar New Year. This newspaper has been away from its readers for seven days. Seeing you all again today, I feel that there are many things to say.

During the Lunar New Year in Hong Kong, firecrackers filled the sky, music resounded throughout the city, and theaters, pavilions, and taverns were all packed. It was truly a scene of peace and prosperity, beyond description. But let's reflect for a moment! Have we forgotten that our motherland is being ruthlessly ravaged and bombed by the enemy? Have we forgotten that our homeland, our elders, brothers, and sisters, are struggling and fighting under the enemy's iron hooves and artillery fire? Have we forgotten that the fate of our entire nation and ourselves has not yet escaped the crisis of utter destruction!

We have heard and seen the licentious and shameless behavior of a small number of compatriots during the Lunar New Year. Of course, we feel boundless shame and indignation, but we should also see the positive work of the many overseas Chinese and many patriotic youth groups during the Lunar New Year, such as the children's Lai See campaign, the National Products Exhibition, the Chinese Merchants' National Assembly's Lunar New Year Bazaar campaign, and even the Chaozhou Merchants Association posting "No New Year Visits During National Crisis" covenants at the doors of various businesses. All of these can allow us to see purity and light from the tainted darkness, to see the spirit of the Chinese nation and its bright future, and thus feel boundless excitement and anticipation.

What after the Spring Festival? We hope that everyone will carry out self-criticism and collective criticism, reviewing the past and planning for the future. We must do our utmost to curb the licentious and shameless behavior, and we must do our utmost to encourage and develop the glorious competition of patriotic salvation movements. We must concentrate all our efforts to fight for the independence of our motherland, for the liberation of the people, and for the happiness of the masses!

The compatriots of our motherland, from government authorities to the general public, are all fighting and moving forward in extremely difficult and dangerous circumstances in the war-torn areas. Both the front lines and the rear are urgently calling for assistance. We hope that everyone will quickly become serious, become vigilant, take on their respective responsibilities, and live up to the expectations of the motherland and the expectations of people of peace and justice around the world.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Shenzhen Wildly

On the 21st, which was the third day of the Lunar New Year, Japanese planes in formation wildly bombed Shenzhen Luohu, causing an unprecedented tragedy on the Sino-British border.

This time, the Japanese planes took advantage of the Lunar New Year to wildly bomb the Sino-British border, turning the entire market town of Shenzhen into ruins and slaughtering hundreds of refugees. What does this tragedy tell us?

First, this action by the Japanese enemy exposes their true colors of massacring the Chinese people and murdering the Guangdong compatriots. It exposes that the recent propaganda by enemy traitors and pro-Japanese, anti-Communist advocates of peace, such as "the Japanese army is implementing Sino-Japanese friendship" and "the situation in Guangzhou is peaceful and happy," are completely shameless lies and completely malicious plots. The true content of the Japanese enemy's appeasement policy has already been exposed. The Guangdong compatriots will not only not be deceived, but they will certainly not surrender under the Japanese enemy's .

Second, this action by the Japanese enemy, together with the dispatch of heavy troops to Hainan Island last week, has the same meaning. Moreover, this attempt is intertwined with the French policy of continuing to concede to Italy and Germany on the Spanish issue. Now, the British government has protested the bombing of the British boundary by the enemy planes, but this protest requires the support of strength, one being the progress of the global movement to aid China and jointly boycott Japan, and the other being our country's persistence in united resistance.

### Guam Base Construction Case, Fierce Debate in the US House of Representatives, Vinson Demands Passage of the Budget, To Answer Dictators in the Same Way

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The House of Representatives yesterday fiercely debated the Guam naval aviation base construction case. Chairman Vinson of the House Naval Committee demanded the passage of the US$54 million budget for the construction of the naval and air force base and delivered a speech, saying, "It is time for the United States to answer dictators in the same way. If the United States builds a naval base in Guam, the world will know that the United States is not like other unprepared countries that await death all day long." Representative Fish vigorously opposed the fortification of Guam, saying that this plan undoubtedly places "a thorn in Japan's throat."

[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 22nd] During yesterday's Tuesday session of the House of Representatives, the issue of fortifying Guam in the central Pacific was once again intensely debated. A representative, speaking on behalf of the White House, explained that the plan to fortify Guam is not to be used as a current fortress. This construction is actually needed to cope with the more severe situation in the Far East in the future.

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] Observers here believe that the intense attacks on President Roosevelt by the Italian and German newspapers are actually intended to portray Chamberlain as a man of peace and falsely accuse Roosevelt as a warmonger.

### Lessons of the European Situation in 1938

--Translated by Shizhang, Original by M. Osipov, Abridged from the January Issue of Moscow News

In the spring of 1938, Germany, using the threat of violent force, seized Austria, turning a country that had been independent for seven hundred years into a colony that had lost its independence. In the autumn of the same year, we saw the partition of Czechoslovakia. A country that had strived for independence for over a thousand years was now at the mercy of Germany. Although Chamberlain announced after returning from Munich that he had "obtained peace for our time," what we saw as "peace" was: the frantic expansion of armaments by various countries, the harsh criticism of Britain by Fascist leaders, the deterioration of Franco-Italian relations, Italy's demands for Tunisia, Corsica, Gibraltar, Nice, etc., German troops concentrated on the Polish border, and preparations to completely occupy Danzig and Memel. After Munich, Britain and France continued to adopt a policy of retreat and compromise with Fascist countries. The Franco-German Declaration of December 6 of last year is a clear proof of this. Italy's challenging tone towards France is a great humiliation for France. This is a direct result of the policy of compromise. The aggressors have dealt France a blow, causing France to lose the dignity it should have as a strong nation. However, France's own actions have had an even greater impact on striking France out of the ranks of strong nations. As for Britain, it has not changed its attitude and policy. It is trying to reach an understanding with Germany on the colonial issue. However, Hitler's demand for the return of all former German colonies means that Britain and Tanganyika will lose one of Britain's biggest gains after the European War. Therefore, the colonial issue is very difficult to resolve. South African Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Jan Smuts's visit to London and Berlin was clearly a failure, although Britain had high hopes for his mission. According to a report in the French "Le Temps," Smuts made a statement after visiting Britain and Germany: "Europe is now heading towards the path of war. Although no country wants to go to war, everyone is preparing for war. If the severe international situation cannot be reversed within one or two months, there is a possibility of war breaking out in the spring of 1939."

This is our "peace for our time"! Aggressors are insatiable. They confine the people already under their control in military prisons and concentration camps. Due to internal unrest, the position of Fascist countries is very shaky and unstable.

Last September, the German people unanimously expressed their opposition to war. Impartial observers all believed that the situation in Germany at that time was like an unofficial "national referendum." The masses gave a strong "veto" to the Fascist war policy. The German government's response to this "national referendum" was the expulsion of Jews, subjecting them to all kinds of cruel treatment. Thus, Europe returned to the barbaric era and the dark ages of the Middle Ages.

The outlook for the world situation this year is very bleak. China is currently at war, and its cruelty and barbarity are unparalleled. The war in Spain is still continuing, and the war in Abyssinia has not completely ended. Weak countries in Central Europe are facing serious threats from Fascist aggression. The sound of swords rubbing against each other, the sound of machine guns firing, the sound of cannons booming, and the sound of bombs exploding are heard all over the world. Although only twenty years have passed since the end of the European War, now, another hundred million people have been plunged into the new imperialist war. Recalling what happened twenty years ago, the people of Europe were all celebrating the end of the Great War with frenzy, thinking that they could enjoy a long period of peace. Unexpectedly, twenty years later, the capitalist world will once again fall into the Second World War. Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty, Germany has torn up the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Locarno, and Italy has disturbed the balance of power in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The seeds of a new war have already been sown all over the world. In fact, this war has already begun, and it is expanding day by day, becoming a world war more barbaric than ten great wars combined!

The evolution of history is often repetitive. Munich has replaced Versailles. After annexing Austria and partitioning Czechoslovakia, the current Germany is gazing at the cowardly actions of Britain and France, and the defenseless small countries. Although its attempt to expand to "three-quarters of the entire Europe" has not yet succeeded, it has already released poison gas, spreading it everywhere, preparing to carry out aggression. The European situation in 1938 clearly shows that Germany is a country that threatens world peace and provokes war. However, Hitler repeatedly says that he is working for peace. Recently, the American Opinion Research Corporation conducted a test in the United States and Britain, asking the question, "Do you believe Hitler's statement that he has no ambition to seize territory in Europe?" As a result, 92 percent of the respondents answered "No." People all over the world know the serious danger that Fascists pose to humanity. True peace cannot be achieved unless the Fascist aggressors are eliminated.

Germany, under the pretext of "the self-determination of the German people," enslaves the weak nations of Europe. However, is the annexation of Austria and the partition of Czechoslovakia for the sake of national self-determination? Similarly, Japan, under the pretext of "saving China from the shackles of the white empires," is carrying out a cruel war of aggression against China, killing civilians, seizing land, is this saving China? People with understanding are very clear about this, so the heroic Chinese people are united, supporting the war of resistance, and opposing the aggression of Japanese imperialism in order to seek national independence and freedom. The war in Spain has also entered its third year. For the sake of national independence, the Spanish people are continuing the war of resistance to the end, regardless of any sacrifice.

1938 has passed. The tragedies of annexing Austria and partitioning Czechoslovakia all happened that year. This is certainly the crime of the Fascist countries, but Britain and France, who are called the leaders of democratic countries, should also bear considerable responsibility. This is a precious lesson. It is hoped that democratic countries and their wise leaders will remember this lesson, eliminate the scourge of Fascism, and work together for human peace, cultural development, and world progress.

### The Chinese Area Was Bombed, Then the British Area Was Bombed Too! × Planes Madly Bomb Shenzhen Luohu - Details - Japan's Protest to the British Government Has Not Yet Been Answered - Japanese Military Announces It Was a Mistake and Dropped Bombs into the British Area

(Reuters, London, 22nd) According to the diplomatic correspondent of the "Daily Mail," "After the British government protested to Japan about the bombing of Hong Kong, Japan's attitude has not yet been ascertained. According to British cabinet ministers' observations, Japan currently has no intention of provoking disputes with British and American interests in the Far East, because Japan is deeply aware of the many difficulties in the war with China, and is also afraid that the Soviet Union may take action next spring," it is said.

(Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd) Yesterday, Wednesday afternoon, the Japanese military announced the incident of Japanese planes dropping bombs on the British area on Tuesday morning, stating that Japanese planes bombed Shenzhen on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway in the Chinese area at 11:00 a.m., and one plane mistakenly dropped bombs on the British area. It also said that the Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong has expressed regret to the British side.

(Hong Kong News) At 9:00 a.m. on the third day of the Lunar New Year, × planes launched another large-scale attack on Shenzhen, dropping dozens of bombs in Shenzhen Market, killing more than a hundred innocent civilians. They then ravaged the refugee camps, bombing and then strafing with machine guns, causing a terrible tragedy. Finally, they flew over the British area of Luohu and Sheung Shui, dropping six bombs, killing more than twenty people, including one Indian constable stationed in Luohu. After this incident, the border situation became tense again. When the × planes bombed Luohu, Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote happened to be watching from the roof of his villa in Fanling. He witnessed × planes dropping many bombs on the British area. Also, when the × planes bombed the 24th passenger and freight train, the landing point of the bombs was only two miles from the Governor's villa, and the sound of the explosion was clearly audible. After Sir Geoffry returned to Hong Kong, he immediately reported the × army's ×× to the British court, and at noon, the Colonial Secretary, Mr. Smith, notified the acting Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong, Mr. Ohta Tokifusa, to meet with him. The Governor ××××××××××××× the Japanese plane bombing of the British area. The Governor and the Japanese Consul-General had a lengthy conversation. Mr. Ohta has submitted ××××× to his superiors. British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, also lodged a protest with the Japanese government yesterday. Currently, all Chinese and foreign people in Hong Kong are paying close attention to the progress of this matter. After the incident occurred, the reporter rushed to investigate, and the detailed process is recorded as follows:

× Nine Planes Suddenly Arrived

The tragedy occurred at 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. At that time, nine × planes flew in from the direction of Nantou, seven of which were bombers and two were fighter planes. They flew very low. As soon as they arrived over Shenzhen, four of them bombed Shenzhen Market, while the other five ravaged the refugee camps and the radio station. That day was the third day of the Lunar New Year. Most of the merchants in the market had opened their businesses early that morning. It was also breakfast time. The × planes arrived suddenly, and all the merchants in the market were unprepared. As soon as the × planes arrived over Shenzhen Market, they immediately circled and dropped bombs. The first bomb landed on the Xinxin Dongfang Hotel in Dongmen, which was the headquarters of the political police team. The kitchen in the rear collapsed and burned after being hit. Then, the county government office was also hit. Bombs fell one after another on the streets throughout the market. The loud sounds echoed through the valleys. After the political police team leader, Que Mingguang, stationed at the Xinxin Dongfang Hotel escaped, he immediately led his team members to extinguish the burning part to prevent it from spreading.

Dozens of Bombs Dropped, More Than a Hundred Killed or Injured

Statistics show that dozens of bombs fell on the streets throughout the market, and the number of collapsed houses was difficult to count at that time. During the bombing, men, women, old, and young in the market fled in panic. The situation was extremely chaotic. Because the incident was sudden, many did not have time to escape, and more than a hundred people were killed or injured. Many of the victims were buried under the rubble. Cries and lamentations filled the air. The situation was extremely tragic. After the × planes dropped dozens of bombs, they did not fly away. When the refugees in the market were desperately fleeing, they flew low and circled, strafing with machine guns, firing dozens of rounds. Many refugees were shot and killed on the spot while fleeing. The × planes ravaged the market for half an hour before flying towards the Chinese-British border. After Shenzhen Market was plundered, the situation was very chaotic. The bodies of the dead were left on the roadside, the injured groaned and cried, and those who were not injured had already fled.

Five Planes Bomb Refugee Hospital

In addition, five × planes ravaged the Yousheng Theater and the refugee camp. They first dropped several bombs on the main hall of the Yousheng Theater, but fortunately, they did not hit. The bombs landed on the riverbank and the nearby Dongru Tea House, injuring several people. At that time, the refugees in the camp heard the loud sound of bombs and knew that the situation was urgent. They fled the camp one after another. The refugee camp supervisor, He Mengxuan, led the staff to maintain order and, seeing that the × planes were dropping bombs more and more densely and targeting the refugee camp, ordered the newly built bamboo bridge to be opened to allow the refugees to cross into the British area. All the refugees in the camp then crossed into the British area amidst the bombing and strafing by the × planes. Because of the overcrowding, several people rushed to be the first and jumped into the river to swim across into the British area. At that time, the × planes saw the refugees moving in the air and flew low over the bridge, strafing the refugee crowd with machine guns, injuring several more people on the spot.

Invading the British Territory and Bombing Trains

After these two groups of × planes attacked the refugee camp and Shenzhen Market, they gathered to bomb the radio station. They circled and dropped more than twenty bombs near the radio station, injuring customs officers and civilians. At about 9:40, ten minutes later, Japanese planes suddenly flew diagonally into the British area from over Shenzhen. Five planes flew first, and four planes followed behind, farther away. Two of the five planes flew to the area between Luohu and Sheung Shui stations. The 24th passenger and freight train happened to be approaching Bridge No. 47. Duan Zhang Pan Zhifen was on the train and quickly ordered the train to stop and the passengers to escape. The Japanese planes first dropped a bomb, which landed in the fields between the Middlesex military camp and the railway. They continued to drop a bomb, which hit the left side of the railway. Shrapnel flew, destroying the windpipe and fire bucket of the third locomotive. The steel rails on the side of the bomb crater were only slightly damaged. The Japanese planes continued to strafe the passengers who were running away with machine guns. Two people were hit near Bridge No. 48. None of the train crew members were injured. Duan Zhang Pan was knocked into the water by the force of the explosion.

Bombing Luohu Station, Twenty Casualties

The remaining Japanese planes flew to the sky above Bridge No. 49 at Luohu Station. The purpose of the bombing seemed to be the car depot inside the station. A total of four bombs were dropped, and machine guns were used to strafe. An investigation found that the bombs landed on the old British soldier posts on the side of the station, killing on the spot one Indian constable, No. 750, Suda Xing, one Dragon Customs private, Hua _, No. 8, and six Chinese, including one child. Next to the posts were parked two or three passenger cars, Nos. 7-4 and 80, which were used as accommodations for Indian constables. The glass windows of the cards had been destroyed. The station chief and residents were taking refuge in the car depot at the time, and fortunately, they were not injured, but many of the glass windows were shattered. Part of the telephone line between Luohu and Sheung Shui was severed by the explosion. The station was covered in blood for a time. As of 1:30 p.m., the bodies had not yet been cleared. Statistics showed that a total of six bombs were dropped by the Japanese in the British area, all of which were light bombs with a wide spread. Twelve people were killed and about fifteen people were injured in the British area. At that time, four planes were in the Chinese area, and they together flew and dropped two bombs near the railway bridge at the border between Luohu and Sheung Shui, intending to destroy the railway bridge, but they missed. The bombing in the British area lasted for about ten minutes before they flew towards Nantou. After the × planes left, the Hong Kong authorities received the news and immediately issued an emergency order from the Governor. The military and police were mobilized to go to the border to defend. The chief of staff also went to inspect the scene with the police chief, Henry, at noon that day. The border situation became tense again. The railway gate was still open, allowing the refugees who fled to the British area to cross.

Three Thousand Refugees Moved Back to Fanling

As for the more than three thousand refugees in the United Relief Association's unified reception center, they had completely retreated into the British area two hours after the incident. The relief team of the Relief Association and the person in charge of Huiyang Association rushed to the New Territories to take care of the situation. They discussed with Bishop Hall and Father Lai Yien, who were in charge of the Emergency Relief Association, and decided to temporarily move the refugees back to Fanling. They were accommodated in the original day-shift train carriages and persuaded by the police authorities to return to Fanling. The police have sent personnel to guard the strategic points in the New Territories to prevent the refugees from dispersing. It was not until after 1:00 a.m. that things were finally settled. The refugees spent the night in the Fanling, and some were in Sheung Shui, and they were not gradually accepted into the Fanling carriages until tomorrow.

Ruins After the Robbery, A Scene of Desolation

The reporter inspected the bombed Shenzhen Market in the afternoon of that day. Bullet marks could still be seen on the ruined walls and vehicles near the Weihu Station. Blood stains of the dead remained on the ground. Crossing the Chinese border, the blood stains and bullet marks were shocking. Along the road, refugees from the market were fleeing to the British area, turning into the market. All that could be seen were collapsed walls and broken tiles. The once prosperous market town had suddenly become a field of rubble. In the market, dozens of houses were collapsed on South Qing Street, Yunsheng Street, Yazi Street, Dongxin Street, Shangda Street, and Xixing Street. Even those that were not destroyed had been deserted in nine out of ten rooms. The scene was extremely desolate. From time to time, mutilated limbs or bloody corpses were found in the disaster area, and the tragic scene was unbearable to witness.

The British Side Lodges a Serious Protest to Japan

Furthermore, at 4:45 p.m. yesterday, a × plane flew to Shenzhen at a high altitude of more than 1,000 feet for reconnaissance, but did not drop any bombs, and then flew away. Also, the Hong Kong Air Force Command dispatched two planes at about 9:00 a.m. yesterday to fly over Luohu and Shenzhen, circling for as long as two hours. As for the incident of the × planes dropping bombs in the border area, killing and injuring the people. Currently, the Hong Kong authorities have stated that the British court has protested to Japan. Regarding this matter, the "Hong Kong Telegraph" published the following news: 1. The Hong Kong Colonial Secretary, Mr. Smith, visited the acting Japanese Consul in Hong Kong yesterday to discuss the matter of Japanese planes dropping bombs in the British area for a long time. The British Ambassador, Sir Robert Clive, has lodged a serious protest with the Tokyo authorities. 2. When the Japanese planes dropped bombs in the British area, Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote happened to be with his wife, son, and Major Beatty, and witnessed the situation clearly. The place where the Japanese planes dropped bombs was only two miles away from the villa, and the sound of the explosion was clearly audible. 3. According to the opinion of the Hong Kong Army authorities, there is currently no need to increase the garrison on the border, nor to order the defense forces to use anti-aircraft guns when necessary.

### Before and After [New Year] (I)

-- Qi Zhuo

Some People Laugh, Some People Suffer

"A scholar who has been away for three days must be looked at with new eyes." This newspaper and its readers have been apart for seven days, and it is inevitable that there will be very many exciting and exciting news that needs to be reported to the readers as quickly as possible. What I want to sketch here is the general trend "Before and After the New Year" during the suspension period:

The only carnival festival for the Hong Kong compatriots in the metropolis, the pulsating artery, is still the Lunar New Year.

"New Year" in Hong Kong is like the metropolis's artery throbbing, throbbing at an accelerating pace. Throb – Throb – The characteristics of feudal and capitalist societies are nakedly exposed; the two extremes of "rich" and "poor" are also sharply opposed.

Transportation is the nervous system of a city; it is also frantically circling around New Year's. The "human tide" at the United Pier is surging in one batch after another. The ferries are shuttling back and forth. The last ferry on "New Year's Eve" was not until 3:00 am!

Trams and buses are just as crowded as ferries. Unless you can cough up a few more cents to sit on a higher grade, you can suffer less from the crowding.

The market for selling New Year's goods is like a disturbed hornet's nest, with everyone carrying large baskets and small baskets of various goods weaving through the crowd. Clearly, some are driving around enjoying the breeze with flowers and toys, while others are busy buying soy sauce and vinegar.

Market Conditions

The bustling situation in the flower markets in Hong Kong and Kowloon on "New Year's Eve" broke all historical records, but this was originally because a large number of refugees were joining in the fun, and the customers were as rare as morning stars. Hanging bells, peach blossoms, daffodils... all started at high prices, and until about two o'clock on New Year's Eve, they were sold cheaply because there were many viewers and few buyers. On the morning of New Year's Day, this reporter personally saw two large plum blossoms that had not been invited into tall buildings the night before, lying decadently next to a pile of chamber pots, as if sighing deeply in Pang Lane, Daan Terrace. They came from afar, and they were both lucky and unlucky!

The flower vendors' profits were indeed very meager, and the business of relying on transportation to the mainland was also very bleak due to the war. According to general custom, on the second day of the New Year, the boss treats the staff to a hearty drink. There must be chicken in the middle. After eating it, they announce who will stay and who will leave in the New Year. This year, due to the impact of the war, inland business was declared bankrupt, and "inevitably shrinking and dismissing employees." "Ruthless chicken" is really ruthless, but where to go after the baggage is packed? Looking at the war-torn homeland, Hong Kong has another group of bitter people.

Hong Kong's population has suddenly increased from 300,000 to 1.1 million. Those who sell food and daily necessities are of course making three times the profit. During the New Year, the price of food more than doubled, which is common. For example, chicken usually costs six or seven cents per catty, but it can cost as much as one dollar and two cents during the New Year. Also, because there are more high-class refugees, the number of extravagant customers has also increased. Therefore, the owners of department stores, restaurants, and dance halls are all smiling. The business of those other than these is frowning because of the war. I sincerely hope that the overseas Chinese will persevere and support the victory of the war, so that everything can be brought back to normal and developed normally, so that not some people laugh and some people suffer.

The World of Firecrackers

From "New Year's Eve" onwards, the dense sound of firecrackers constantly struck people's eardrums, and it was not until the afternoon of the second day of the Lunar New Year that it thinned out a little. Yesterday, the fourth day of the Lunar New Year, when the market reopened, it was lively again. In these days and nights of harassment, it really irritated people who could not sleep.

Merchants and shops said that it was for "thanking the gods" and "supporting the facade." Some are a long string of electric light firecrackers, and some are a tree of fireworks, which easily attract a group of pedestrians. As a result, the car is as clumsy as a pig and cannot move forward, and the police officers who maintain order are shouting east and west, very busy.

Walking on the road, either a "bang" startles you, or the paper and sparks of firecrackers unceremoniously pounce on you, as if you are drilling through a forest of guns and bullets. The fleeing compatriots cannot help but think of the taste of being under bombs and machine gun fire. That is a chilling memory. However, how many compatriots in the homeland are still living under bombing!

It is said that in previous years, the burning of firecrackers was even more狂熱. This year, it is considered to be slightly reduced due to the impact of the war. However, such unwarranted waste is still considered a regrettable thing by those who care!

General Customs of the New Year

The "big lanterns" under the arcade are shining, reflecting the "neon lights". There are good men and women of faith kneeling on the ground and 向 香 bowing their heads to the red paper strips of "Welcoming the God of Wealth at the Doorway Landlord" and "Protecting the God of Wealth with the Land at the Staircase". They also posted Spring Festival couplets such as "Happy New Year" and "Harmony Brings Wealth."

After worshiping the gods and burning firecrackers on "New Year's Eve," they have a drink in the newly decorated shops and homes with calligraphy and paintings, and then play mahjong.

When you get up on "New Year's Day," you bow to each other and say auspicious words when you meet. Business cards are flying, widely posting New Year's advertisements. There must be articles in exchanging gifts and visiting each other. "Lucky money" is a courtesy of reciprocity, which is the greatest hope of children and servants in a year.

The ways of worshiping gods and ancestors vary in complexity, and the ways of playing tricks vary. Although they live in a "progressive" city, there are still many, many unbreakable feudal customs that have been passed down from generation to generation.

The "New Year" of the Working Class

The working class, who take the building as their home and as their bed, have an even more miserable New Year. The boss is driving them away, the pedestrians are harassing them, and the firecrackers are attacking and persecuting them. People are dressed in beautiful clothes, but the clothes and appearance of the poor are still the same as usual on "New Year's Day." The poor little beggars are full of infinite hope, thinking that by stringing together a few auspicious words, a short song, and pasting red paper strips on the money-collecting milk cans or broken boxes, they can win the favor of the "rich people". Who knew that the rich people would think: "How annoying – if you give one, another one comes! Giving a copper coin passively is of no help!" Their hopes were dashed with cold water. One disappointment after another!

The children who shine shoes have particularly good business on New Year's Day because they can give people a little "glory." Shining a few more pairs of shoes and earning a few more copper coins is the New Year's hope for a large group of sad-faced children.

A group in short clothes and pants is either gambling copper coins on the dirty ground, or grouping together in groups of three or five to gamble low cards. Some also place square mahjong tables in the store or in a seat in order to play cards while doing business. Those who do work are all the same. Although they cannot be as "comfortable" as those who live in tall buildings, they enjoy themselves. They are also enjoying the "New Year" to the fullest.

What will happen after the "New Year"? Those who are unemployed, those who are fleeing... are still at a loss as to where to return!

### Five Robberies in a Week of Spring Vacation - The Submarine "Hankou" Also Visited - Two Men and Women Work Together to Resist the Thieves and Seize Their Weapons

During the spring vacation, a total of five robbery cases occurred in Hong Kong and Kowloon. The details are as follows: (1) On the second floor of No. 8 Shan Village Road, Happy Valley, at 3:30 p.m. on the 15th of this month, three robbers used the pretext of delivering gifts to commit robbery. However, they were discovered by the owner, who blew the whistle to alert the police. The thieves fled in panic. Police detectives arrived at the scene to investigate and found two small knives at the stairs, which were taken back to the police station for filing. (2) On the 15th of this month, at 6:00 p.m., a man, Liu Zhigen, and his girlfriend were out for a walk when a man approached them for alms at Six Mile Stone on Tai Po Road. However, he was refused. The man then tried to draw a gun. Mr. Liu immediately resisted. At that time, Mr. Liu's girlfriend took the gun from the thief from behind. The two sides fought into a group. As a result, the bandit could not resist and fled. Mr. Liu then took the gun to the police station to report the case. (3) On the 16th of this month, at about 5:00 a.m., in a building at a certain number on Bute Street, Yau Ma Tei, three armed bandits broke into the house to commit robbery. The owner, Mrs. Zhang _, and her family were all tied up by the thieves. As a result, jewelry and silver worth more than 400 yuan were robbed. (4) On the 17th of this month, at 11:00 p.m., a man, Ye Fang, was on the submarine "Hankou" opposite Tsim Sha Tsui when six robbers boarded the ship in a sampan and robbed more than a hundred yuan in cash. (5) On the 17th of this month, a man, Pan Quan, went to the police station to report that at _ o'clock that afternoon, when he was passing through Beihe Street, Sham Shui Po, he was intercepted by three robbers, two with swords and one with a pistol, who robbed him of 95 yuan. After receiving the report, the police authorities were quite suspicious of the case and are currently investigating.

### Spring Holiday Supplement: Hong Kong News - National Goods Exhibition

The Second Chinese Products Exhibition, organized by the Chinese Manufacturers' Union, was held at the South China Middle School in Kowloon on the 19th of this month. The exhibition lasted for four days and concluded successfully at 10 pm last night. 128 manufacturers participated, showcasing over a thousand kinds of products. Over the four days, the exhibition was extremely crowded with an estimated 200,000 visitors. According to Mr. Xie Bochang, the association's affairs director, the manufacturers participating in this exhibition were specially permitted by the association to freely sell goods, with 5% of the proceeds to be handed over to the association. After deducting expenses, all remaining funds will be used for charitable purposes. The total sales for the four days were approximately $8,000.

Increased Heavy Oil Tax

The Hong Kong authorities, seeking new sources of revenue, appointed a New Tax Research Committee to handle the matter. It was announced in the Gazette last Saturday, the 6th, regarding the imposition of a tax on heavy oil for land use (commonly known as kerosene). The Attorney General will present it for discussion at the upcoming Legislative Council meeting. If there are no objections, it will be passed and implemented. Once implemented, each gallon of heavy oil will be taxed at 30 cents, equivalent to the tax on light gasoline used in ordinary motors. With the implementation of this tax, the Hong Kong government's monthly tax revenue is expected to increase by approximately $20,000, amounting to about $240,000 to $250,000 annually.

Serious Truck Accident

At around 3 pm on February 20th (the second day of the Lunar New Year), a truck accident occurred near Wuhu Street, Hung Hom, resulting in one death and three injuries. The truck involved was vehicle number 519 of the Luen Tai Transportation Company. On that day, Chen Huo, an employee of the company, his wife Fang Huiqing, and their daughter Chen Weiqiang (4 years old) were visiting relatives in Hung Hom. They, along with Chen Hai and Su Sheng, were riding on the truck. At around 3 pm, while driving near Wuhu Street in Hung Hom, the truck suddenly crashed into the nearby hillside, causing it to overturn. Chen Huo's wife and daughter, who were sitting in the back of the truck, were thrown out onto the ground about ten feet away, sustaining injuries all over their bodies. Chen Hai was unharmed. After the accident, Chen Hai fled the scene. The girl, Chen Weiqiang, died in the hospital shortly after admission due to severe injuries.

Factory Fire

The Sun Cheung Automobile Body Manufacturing Factory near Kowloon Hospital on Argyle Street, Mong Kok, caught fire at 6:30 pm on the 18th of this month (Lunar New Year's Eve). Because the factory's building materials, such as bamboo, wood, and palm, were all flammable, once ignited, the fire spread rapidly. It took over an hour to extinguish the fire, by which time the entire factory had been reduced to ashes. Several Studebaker trucks inside the factory were also partially burned, with losses estimated at around $80,000.

Xu Jian Sentenced to Imprisonment

Xu Jian, a clerk at the Hong Kong office of the Chinese Ministry of Finance, was accused of embezzlement by stealing official letters. Barrister Wen Jin represented the Ministry of Finance in the prosecution, while lawyer Xi Bingxi represented the defendant. After multiple interrogations by the judge, the defendant completed his testimony yesterday afternoon. After arguments from both lawyers, the judge ruled that the evidence was conclusive, and the charges were established. The defendant was sentenced to six months of imprisonment.

### Shenzhen's Bloodstains

— Luo Xia

On the third day of the Lunar New Year, as Hong Kong was filled with the sound of firecrackers and joyful cheers, nine × planes flew over Shenzhen Market in the early morning, wantonly slaughtering residents and creating the biggest blood debt of this year. They even crossed into British airspace – Luohu and Sheung Shui – indiscriminately dropping bombs and killing people with machine guns. This insane and inhumane act has been inflicted on the eleventh country. We will not dwell on it for now, but will record this blood debt.

Taking the train to Luohu at noon, the first thing that catches the eye is the tall building made of red bricks – the station building. The glass in the windows of the building has all been shattered, leaving only some broken frames swaying in the wind. This is the vicious result of the × planes' machine guns – many lives were lost here.

A few yards further on, the police substation built with cement has also collapsed. A huge and tattered flag hangs on the adjacent wall, marking that this territory was also hit by several bombs. Were the × planes unable to see clearly? Then why were two bombs dropped on the river opposite the Sheung Shui garrison camp? Can this still be denied?

A bomb also fell on the Shenzhen railway station platform. Countless people were killed along the road by × people's machine guns. Mounds of new sand, one pile after another, line the side of the road. An official from the refugee camp traveling with us told us that this is the temporary place to bury the compatriots who died in the disaster!

Running forward along the road, apart from a few of us in the same profession, there were only scattered people fleeing backward. Arriving at Shenzhen Market, all that could be seen were ruined walls and broken tiles, courtesy of the × planes. Five bombs fell on Nanqing Street, ten on Yun Sheng, and countless more on Yazi Street, Dongxin Street, Shangda Street, and Xixing Zheng Street. Suhang Street was also cut off from traffic by the bombing. The area near the police station was hit by the most bombs, and the back of the station was also blown up. A fire bomb also fell on the New Oriental Hotel, but fortunately, the fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a major disaster.

Dozens of bombs fell on the small market town. Can an inch of it be considered clean? On the street, all that could be seen were tangled electrical wires, roof beams, bricks, and tiles scattered everywhere. Stores that had miraculously escaped the bombing were all closed. Pedestrians were few and far between. Some hungry dogs sniffed the stench of blood, running around and licking. Piles of flies covered the bloodstained clothes, shoes, and socks on the road. The sound of new coffins filled with the newly deceased resonated in the air, and the stench of blood and decay permeated the air, piercing people's hearts and lungs.

Beside the pond along the Sha-Shen highway, there was a pile of minced meat, and a pair of hands and a foot had flown off to who knows where. The exposed intestines were blackened by the intense sunlight. A child of seventeen or eighteen was lying face down on the side of the road, with a bamboo basket beside him. On closer inspection, alas, it turned out to be the corpse of a girl torn apart by bombs, her face terribly gruesome. She died tragically under the bombs of the × people, and she will surely gnash her teeth in hatred in the afterlife.

In a side alley near the police station, an old woman sat on the ruins of her collapsed house, wailing, beating her chest and frantically digging through the rubble. She repeatedly cried out that she wanted to die. Fortunately, the people who came with her were able to persuade her to carry the things she had dug out of the rubble. Stumbling and sobbing, she cried out for her husband and her beloved son. The scene was extremely heartbreaking.

On the street, we met the guerrilla company commander, Que Mingguang. He patted his chest and said that the security here was very good and that no one would dare to steal a single coin. Speaking of the × planes' bombing, he gnashed his teeth and said that the × planes were really vicious. As soon as they arrived, they dropped bombs without even pausing for half a second, so everyone was unable to escape, which is why so many people were killed.

Amidst the rubble, there are still unknown numbers of unexcavated corpses buried. More than two hundred lives have been sacrificed at the hands of the × people. Who doesn't have parents, siblings, wives, and children? Can we bear to watch our relatives be slaughtered for nothing? No, we must make the greatest determination to settle this huge blood debt with the × people.

On the way back, we met County Magistrate Liang Feiren, who had just returned from Hong Kong. After shaking hands and exchanging greetings, we hurried to catch the train and did not have time to inquire about future relief measures. We bid him farewell in haste.

### Yu Hanmou Inspects Defense

As our army is actively reorganizing for a counteroffensive, Yu Hanmou, Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Army Group, accompanied by his deputy commander and staff, inspected the garrison troops at a certain frontline location on the 15th of this month to inspect the defenses. In addition to receiving instructions from the officials, he gathered the officers and soldiers of the area to give a speech, stating that the War of Resistance had entered a new stage, and that combat strategies should be proactively sought to eliminate the Japanese invaders and recover lost territory. He then spoke of the eight military precepts: 1. Implement the Three Principles of the People; 2. Support the supreme leader; 3. Obey the orders of superiors; 4. Practice the New Life Movement; 5. Obey discipline; 6. Be loyal to one's duty; 7. Strive for learning; 8. Resist the war to the end. These are the highest guidelines for all actions of all officers and soldiers of this army group. Officers and soldiers must thoroughly implement them. Finally, he stated that the Japanese warlords invaded our country and were not only enemies of our country but also enemies of the good Japanese people. If the Japanese army surrenders to us, they will be treated preferentially. The puppet troops in the Japanese army are also our compatriots who are forced to fight. He hopes that they can automatically return to our revolutionary front. Those who kill enemies and return will be generously rewarded. He hopes that everyone will pay attention to and comply with this. After the speech, the officers and soldiers shouted slogans such as "Resist the war to the end!", "Down with the Japanese warlords!", and "Long live the Chinese nation!", their spirit high and their determination to swallow up the barbarians strong. Then, the officers and soldiers gathered for a meal to show their sincere unity and share the hardships. (Continental News Agency)

### The Japanese Occupation of Nantou - Withdrawing After Six Hours

The Japanese invaded Shian County once on the 17th of the month, occupying it for only six hours before withdrawing. Yesterday, a staff member from the Shian County government office in Shenzhen informed the reporter of the details of what happened. According to reports, at 6 am on the 17th, the Japanese invaded from the direction of Taiping. He Ni ×jie, the head of the Taiping puppet maintenance association, also came with the Japanese. By that time, most of the residents of Nantou City had already evacuated, with only a few remaining. The Japanese troops entering the city numbered more than 200, but they belonged to the reconnaissance unit, stationed inside and outside the city. The Japanese army captain searched door-to-door for the person in charge to maintain order in the urban area. Later, he found a certain monk and forced him to take him to see Lei Xingmin, the county official remaining in the county government. Lei was only in the washroom. After seeing Lei, the Japanese captain immediately ordered him to provide the Japanese army with adequate tea and water. Lei said that the residents had all fled, making it difficult to supply. Later, he learned that there were still a few farmers who had not evacuated to the east of the county seat, so he ordered the farmers to be responsible for the supply. The Japanese captain then accompanied Lei and his party back to Da San Yuan Restaurant on Da Xin Street, forcing Lei to prepare meals for 300 Japanese soldiers within half an hour. Just as Lei was struggling to cope, the Japanese suddenly received a telegram and immediately withdrew without even having time to eat. They retreated in a hurry around noon, leaving by boat from Xixiang. The Japanese invasion of Nantou lasted no more than six hours. Before leaving, they threatened Lei again, saying that a puppet maintenance association meeting would be held in Taiping on the first, second, and third days of the Lunar New Year, and forcing Nantou and Xixiang to send representatives to participate, otherwise, they would carry out a large-scale bombing. This is the general situation of the fall of Bao'an County. Lei has already sent a long letter to the Shenzhen office reporting everything, saying that he will come to Shenzhen as soon as possible to report everything to the county magistrate in person.

After arriving in Saigon, the first hurdle is going through the import procedures at the New Guest Office, as described above. The second hurdle is claiming luggage at the Luggage Pavilion. Previously, as soon as a ship docked, all the luggage would be moved into customs. Recently, overseas Chinese from the Seven Prefectures jointly invested (the so-called joint investment here is such that every Chinese person arriving in Annam has two cents added to their import tax, supposedly for building a new luggage pavilion) to build a Luggage Pavilion. The pavilion is located behind the customs. When you go there to claim your luggage, you must first obtain an entry permit and enter according to the order of the numbers. Unfortunately, most overseas Chinese do not follow this order. Everyone rushes to get in first, often enduring beatings from the French. In my opinion, their lack of orderliness stems from two reasons: 1. Illiteracy - The wooden fence at the entrance of the Luggage Pavilion is divided into two small doors, with signs posted beside each door indicating the male and female sections. The female entrance is often mixed with many "甲人" (unidentified people). This proves their illiteracy. 2. Lack of training - When they are pushing and shoving each other, if you stand nearby, you will often hear some unconscious remarks, such as "If you're afraid, you wouldn't have come abroad." When you ask them why they are crowding like this, they will answer without thinking, "You want to be fast, can't I be fast?" In short, it is impossible to reason with these people. Since they do not follow the order, they will naturally be beaten. Mencius often said, "People must insult themselves before others insult them." I say that the heads of many overseas Chinese are often beaten by others, and it is entirely their own fault.

The author's first hometown is in Saigon, so I always have to go home to visit my family every few years. Therefore, I am quite familiar with the procedures for claiming luggage. On the 25th, I called a brother early in the morning to help. That day, I went to the entrance of the Luggage Pavilion to get a luggage permit. Fortunately, the number on the entry permit was number 21. Because there was a lot of luggage, one person couldn't carry it all. Therefore, I negotiated with a "Mama" in the Luggage Pavilion (the "Mama" in the Luggage Pavilion is completely different from the "Mama" in the New Guest Office. One is responsible for handling the import documents for overseas Chinese, and the other is responsible for taking care of overseas Chinese claiming luggage.) With her help, I obtained the permission of the Arab guard to allow my brother to run in to help (because he did not have an entry permit, he had to ask privately). After searching for a long time inside, we were finally able to find the seven pieces of luggage. Many of the suitcases were badly damaged, and the bundles were covered in mud. Fortunately, nothing was lost. The management of the Luggage Pavilion is really terrible. The coolies carried the luggage from the ship to the Luggage Pavilion, throwing things around as if they were avenging their father's death. This is what I mean by those porters. Things stored in the Luggage Pavilion are not safe. If it is luggage like mesh baskets, things are lost particularly easily because they are not locked and are easily stolen. Other things, such as "一呷 (unidentified items)", are often damaged, locks are broken, and they are stolen clean. Even entire suitcases can disappear. In my opinion, the loss of things is not only suspicious of the guards, but also of those who go in to claim their luggage first, as they are also suspected of theft. Things are stored in the luggage room, allowing you to rummage through them at will. The guards only check your entry permit against the name written on the cloth strip (or paper) attached to the luggage. I ask, with such a method, can't people bring a few more cloth strips to tie to other people's luggage and prepare some keys to open them for the customs officers to inspect? Therefore, I say that the loss of luggage in the Luggage Pavilion is caused by theft from multiple parties.

After the things are moved out of the luggage room, it takes some time before you can cross another boundary. This boundary is blocked by an Annamese person using a wooden stick. Five people can pass at a time. If you exceed this number, you must wait patiently for him to move the stick before you can pass. At this time, I discovered a customs officer (this person is Annamese) with black glasses on his nose, who was messing around with things at the entrance of the luggage room, using his hands and even his feet. He actually "treated the customs as a playground and kicked the suitcases as if they were balls. Fortunately, the suitcases were strong, otherwise, they would have been in a mess." His expression was indeed a bit unbearable (not for a lifetime). Unfortunately, in the end, he was just a fox exploiting the tiger's might. His features were clearly typical of an Annamese person, but when you tried to deal with him in Annamese, he babbled in French. This made me regret a little that I shouldn't have learned their despised language. Now let's talk about the inspectors in customs. Most of the people working there are French "Madames". Each inspector must have an Annamese person acting as their accomplice. This time, I was inspected by a male French gentleman. His behavior can be said to be the most standard of French gentlemen in Annam. Now let me introduce him.

When I moved the luggage in front of him, he sat very imposingly on a rattan chair. An Annamese person acting as his accomplice sat beside him, rummaging through the suitcases and opening all the clothes, books, and dictionaries one by one for the French gentleman to see. If there was anything slightly good-looking, he could keep it at will. What I mean by "keep it" here should be explained in two ways: 1. Take it for himself, 2. Take it for taxation. Now let me give a few examples. Last time I returned to Saigon from Beiping to visit my family, a "Madame" forcibly took my photo album because she thought it was too cute. She said she should take it. (Please refer to my article "Impressions of the West Bank" in the 7th volume, 10th issue of the "Yu Gong" Semi-Monthly). At the time, there was nothing I could do about it. An overseas Chinese bought an exquisite small suitcase in Hong Kong, and because it was too exquisite, the French gentleman took a fancy to it and confiscated it. In short, if he thinks something is to his liking, whether it is an object or food, you have to give it up to him. As for clothes and other things, almost anything slightly intact has to be taxed. This time I came to Saigon, I originally intended to raise funds for schooling, so I brought a lot of supplies. Like a small alarm clock that has been used for more than two years, a Swedish washbasin that has been washed for many years, a flashlight, a bed curtain, and two blankets, all had to be taxed. Even the crepe scraps that my wife had used to make cheongsams over the years were weighed and taxed. This is really a bit shocking. At the time, if it wasn't for other incidental items, I would have really given those crepe scraps to them to patch up their torn clothes.

They have always been accustomed to seizing the luggage of overseas Chinese as described above. This time, when they inspected my luggage, they found two jade bracelets that I had brought to give as gifts. The French gentleman forcibly took one of them. At that time, I was thinking to myself that I had brought so much luggage, and when they started inspecting, I had already told myself that these things would have to be taxed at least one hundred yuan. Since he has now forcibly taken this jade bracelet, although I have sufficient reason to ask him for it, it would be too much trouble. Because many past experiences have told me that trying to reason with those kind of customs officers is foolish. At the same time, I also thought that this pair of jade bracelets had followed me from the distant motherland to this place, and now they are separated, which made me feel a little sad. While I was thinking this, the jade bracelet had already been stuffed into his pocket. But I was determined to deal with him after the taxes were paid.

When I was packing the scattered things back into the suitcase, I found that the other jade bracelet was also missing. The French gentleman had gone to another place for something, so I questioned the Annamese person who was acting as his accomplice. He always answered irrelevantly, saying "Take the things to pay the tax." I already understood the meaning of his words. So I pulled him up, and he had secretly placed the alarm clock behind his butt. (To be continued)

### Good Football Show This Sunday: South China vs. Hong Kong League Charity Match. Both Lineups Are Set, Strengths Are Comparable, Worth Watching.

[This newspaper's special report] The English Relief Association sympathizes with us. Since setting up a branch in Hong Kong, it has made remarkable achievements in providing relief to Chinese refugees. The branch uses the funds to both request donations from philanthropists and raise funds, accumulating little by little, so that the relief work can proceed without hindrance. Therefore, a charity football match will be held at Caroline Hill at 4 pm on the 26th of this month.

This charity match is between South China and Hong Kong League. The Hong Kong League team has been selected a few days ago, combining Chinese and Western players, and its strength is strong. As for the South China lineup, it was also finalized yesterday. Li Huitang will once again serve for charity, leading the South China army. His appeal will surely be great.

The players of both teams are speaking out for the refugees, which is truly commendable. It is hoped that the general public will enthusiastically attend the event at that time, donating money as they should, and combining charity with entertainment, which is also meaningful.

The Hong Kong League's right winger, Fu La, was recently hospitalized for illness and may not have fully recovered, so this position will be filled by reserve Ambasen. The lineups of the two teams are listed below.

South China Team

Zhang Rongcai (South China Goalkeeper)

Li Tiansheng (South China Defender) Mai Shaohan (South China Defender)

Liu Qingcai (South China Defender) Liang Rongzhao (South China Defender) Liu Weipei (South China Midfielder)

Liu Songsheng (South China Midfielder) Li Zhaorong (South China Midfielder) Li Huitang (South China Striker) Feng Weixiang (South China Striker) Deng Guangsen (South China Striker)

Hong Kong League Team

He Li (Kowloon Club)

Shi Han (Middle Sex) Hou Rongsheng (Guanghua Club)

Xu Jingcheng (Oriental Club) Bi Lidu (St. Joseph's) Ni Bolu (Kowloon Club)

Mo Shi (Police Club) Su Shi (Middle Sex) Da Gaoshan Nu (St. Joseph's) Ge Ni (Middle Sex) Fu La (Hong Kong Club)

(Reserves) Ambasen (Artillery Team) Lidi Shi (Supplies Team) Yi Shi Dulanzhi (Hong Kong Club) Wu Liezhi (Kowloon Club) Pa Jia (Police Club)

### General Review After Watching the Inter-City Matches

First Battle

The Philippine football team came to Hong Kong for inter-city matches. In their first match against the Hong Kong inter-city team on the first day of the Lunar New Year, after ninety minutes of competition, the Hong Kong team proved to be superior in skill and achieved a resounding victory of four to one.

In the first ten minutes of the match, the Philippine team's "high-speed" performance was indeed formidable, and at that time, the situation seemed balanced. However, after fifteen minutes, the Hong Kong team's players performed at their best, gradually turning the match into a one-sided contest. Nevertheless, the Philippine team, with their efforts, only conceded one goal and finished the first half. Not long after the start of the second half, the battle became a tense situation with a score of two to one. From then on, the Hong Kong team controlled the entire field, frequently launching attacks, and finally won with a score of four to one.

Shooting Record

(First Half)

First goal: Lee Wai-tong (Hong Kong)

(Second Half)

Second goal: Lee Wai-tong (Hong Kong)

Third goal: Lees (Philippines)

Fourth goal: Lee Wai-tong (Hong Kong)

Fifth goal: Fu La (Hong Kong)

In this match, the Philippine team only had one scoring opportunity in the first half, which was Lees's shot, indicating that their forward line's offensive power was quite ordinary. In the second half, they also had only five scoring opportunities, and none of them were on target. On the other hand, the Hong Kong team had more than twenty shots close to the goal, but only achieved a success rate of four out of ten. This result is not satisfactory, and it also shows that they missed many opportunities.

In my opinion, the Hong Kong team's victory is undoubtedly due to their superior football skills. However, the reason why they were able to cope with the high-speed Philippine team and prevent them from succeeding seems to be largely due to their "offensive defense." The three midfielders provided excellent cover, effectively supporting the defense during attacks, creating many opportunities to score. Lee Wai-tong's central breakthroughs were therefore particularly effective.

The Hong Kong team's players' skills are already familiar to us, and the spectators at the time also saw them clearly, so there is no need to repeat them. However, regarding the Philippine team's performance, I noticed the following points:

(1) The three forwards advanced and retreated simultaneously, resembling the "single-line" strategy used by Hong Kong football teams many years ago. Therefore, when they advanced, they had to rely on short passes and close attacks, without long-range breakthroughs.

(2) The two wingers always followed the progress of the three forwards, lacking individual styles of flanking attacks.

(3) The three midfielders were good at dribbling and attacking, and relied on their ample energy to run back and forth. They were more than sufficient in assisting the attack, but insufficient in assisting the defense.

(4) Although the two inside forwards were agile and fearless, they lacked crisp footwork to strike the ball directly, and their positioning was not ideal.

In summary, the only strength of the Philippine team's players was their speed and stamina. Most of them lacked experience, but their heading skills were quite good.

The lineups for both teams in this match were as follows:

(Hong Kong Team)

Tam Kwan-kan

Sze Hon, Lee Tin-sang

Leung Wing-chiu, Tik Chun, Hon Nei-wai-lo

Hau Ching-to, Ko Shan-nu, Lee Wai-tong, Fung King-cheung, Fu La

(Philippine Team)

Yao Ngor

Ba Chik-ko, Mo Lan-da

Wa Lee, Yao Kat-ti, Heung Na-ti-si

Pit Chi, Choi Lee, La La-sa-pai, Ha Lee-ti-a, Lee Yay-si

Second Battle

Of the three matches the Philippine team played here, their second match against the Chinese team on the 20th was their best performance. Having tasted Lee Wai-tong's central breakthroughs in the inter-city match, the Philippine team changed their strategy against the Chinese team and adopted the third inside defender method. Yao Kat-ti was responsible for monitoring Lee Wai-tong, ignoring everything else, following his every step. As a result, Lee Wai-tong's terrifying central breakthroughs could not be realized. However, Lee Wai-tong was an experienced veteran who could adapt to the situation. In the second half, he adopted a falling-back strategy, luring Yao Kat-ti far out, and then Lee Siu-wing and Chan Tak-fai attacked from the flanks, defeating the enemy and winning with a score of five to three.

The first half ended in a three-to-one draw. However, for at least two of the three goals conceded by the Chinese team, Tam Kwan-kan should be blamed for his mistakes. The three forwards also did not perform well initially. In the second half, Lee Wai-tong changed to a falling-back strategy, and the attacks suddenly intensified, causing constant scares in front of the Philippine team's goal. This also shows that the Chinese team's forward line had some advantages.

Shooting Record

(First Half)

First goal: La La-sa-pai (Philippines)

Second goal (penalty): Lee Wai-tong (Chinese team)

Third goal: Hau Ching-to (Chinese team)

Fourth goal: Hau Ching-to (Chinese team)

Fifth goal: La La-sa-pai (Philippines)

Sixth goal: La La-sa-pai (Philippines)

(Second Half)

Seventh goal: Lee Siu-wing (Chinese team)

Eighth goal: Lee Siu-wing (Chinese team)

In this match, the Philippine team used strategies, and the Chinese team was able to adapt to the situation and use strategies accordingly, making it a battle of wits. The performance was more exciting than the inter-city match.

In this match, I also noticed the following points in the Philippine team's performance:

(1) The defenders used a dense defense, but the central defender was restrained by Lee Wai-tong, and the two left and right defenders did not dare to venture far out, so their forward line received very little support.

(2) The forward line's style of play was largely the same as in the inter-city match, but their attacks were fiercer than in the first match, so they were able to achieve a draw in the first half.

The lineups for both teams in this match were as follows:

Chinese Team

Tam Kwan-kan

Lee Tin-sang, Mak Siu-hon

Hui King-sing, Leung Wing-chiu, Sung Ling-sang

Hau Ching-to, Lee Siu-wing, Lee Wai-tong, Chan Tak-fai, Tang Kwong-sam

Philippine Team

Wai Lan-nu-wa

Mo Lan-da, Heung Na-ti-si

Wa Lee-si, Yao Kat-ti, Tu

Pit Chi, Pao Choi-lee, La La-sa-pai, Ha Lee-ti-a, Lee Yay-si

Third Battle

This match was held yesterday. The north wind was extremely strong, and the ball was difficult to control due to the wind, which greatly affected the players' technical performance.

The Hong Kong United team initially faced a headwind, making it difficult to play. Although Liao Ya-chen initially scored a goal, the Philippine team soon equalized. The Philippine team then led 2-1 at the end of the first half.

In the second half, the Philippine team scored another goal, and their momentum was at its peak. Most spectators thought that the Philippine team would definitely win this match and regain some face. However, the Hong Kong United team's situation later improved, and they relentlessly attacked, firing shots like arrows. Although Wai Lan-nu-wa tried his best to cope, he was eventually overwhelmed and unable to defend, so the Hong Kong United team scored three consecutive goals, winning 4-1. The Philippine team lost three times, and this hatred will linger. They will have to wait until the Hong Kong team visits the Philippines in April to seek revenge.

Shooting Record

(First Half)

First goal: Liao Ya-chen (Philippines)

Second goal: Pao Choi (Philippines)

Third goal: La La-sa-pai (Philippines)

(Second Half)

Fourth goal: La La-sa-pai (Philippines)

Fifth goal: Free kick Tang Kwong-sam (Hong Kong)

Sixth goal: Chan Tak-fai (Hong Kong)

Seventh goal: Chan Tak (Hong Kong)

Overall, in the Philippine team's two performances, the goals scored by their forwards were all achieved by going deep into the defense, indicating that their skills were very poor. In summary, the Philippine team's technical level is far behind Hong Kong's, and they cannot compete with Hong Kong for supremacy for the time being.

This morning, the Philippine team took a ship to Macau to play a match. In the afternoon, they rushed back and will take the Italian postal ship Conte Biancamano back to the Philippines. (Football Field Deity)

The lineups for the two teams in yesterday's match were as follows:

(Philippine Team)

Mo Lan-da, Wai Lan-nu-wa, Ba Chik-ko

Wa Lee-si, Yao Kat-ti-si, Heung Na-yay-ti

Pit Chi, Pao Choi-lee, La La-sa-pai, Tu, Lee Yay-si

### Knowledge of Physical Training Should Be

-- Wang Xue Zheng

(1) Although most exercises can simultaneously develop muscles, strengthen internal organs, and build strength, if the muscles are too underdeveloped and you want to specifically develop muscles or make muscles as perfect as possible, you must engage in exercises that focus on muscle development. This type of exercise is slightly different from exercises that strengthen internal organs and build strength. Exercises that focus on muscle development require 60% to 85% of your full effort. The number of repetitions should be between 1 and 15 times. If you want to focus on strengthening internal organs, you must focus on torso exercises, requiring only 30% to 50% of your full effort. The number of repetitions should be around 10 times. The methods for building stamina and strength are different. To build stamina, you must practice exercises such as long-distance running and rope skipping, with a long duration. This type of exercise itself is relatively easy, but if you continue exercising for too long, the difficulty or the body's response is no less than strenuous exercise. Exercises that focus on building strength require you to exert full effort or more than 85% of your full effort. The number of repetitions should be between 1 and 3 times.

(2) Regarding muscle development, most people focus on the muscles of the upper body, especially the arms and abdomen. However, to make the body's muscles as perfect as possible, you must first develop the muscles of the legs. The legs can be said to be the strongest part of the body, and also the most difficult to train. In order for the body's muscles to develop to the most perfect level, you must practice strenuous exercises. If the leg muscles are too weak, even if you can handle strenuous exercises, you are at risk of injury. Seeing that leg training exercises can promote systemic circulation and are particularly beneficial to the heart and lungs. The legs are also the foundation of our body. Solid buildings must have a strong foundation. Our bodies are the same. To develop leg muscles, you must focus on strenuous exercises, but you must not ignore various easy leg exercises.

(3) The reason why our exercise needs to be both strenuous and light is because on the one hand, it wants to promote metabolism and blood circulation, and on the other hand, it makes muscle fibers grow and develop muscles. This kind of exercise can also be said to be "internal" and "external" development, most suitable for people with moderate or above physical strength.

(4) There are many types of freehand and equipment exercises. We cannot determine which is the best exercise. Sometimes exercise also needs to be "prescribed according to the symptoms" or vary from person to person. Exercises that are suitable for A are not necessarily suitable for B. There is no fixed standard for the exercise procedure.

(5) The movements must be thorough, and the posture must be correct. The exercise is to give the muscles the opportunity to stretch thoroughly on the one hand, and to contract thoroughly on the other hand.

(6) The breathing method must be correct. Under no circumstances should you stop breathing, otherwise the circulation and other systems will suffer great damage and can cause serious diseases such as the heart.

(7) Exercise should always have changes. Just for one muscle in the upper arm, the biceps, there are already dozens of training methods. If you want to make it develop to the most perfect place, you must take turns practicing all the exercises that train that part. However, during each exercise, the exercise of each part of the body should not exceed three types. In addition, exercise must also have progress. The progress of exercise is to increase the weight of the equipment and to improve the mode of exercise. When you start to exercise, you must start light and heavy. (Below)

### Pull Until It Breaks

— Ling Mo

Perhaps it is Ms. Williams' subtle irony. She says that fascist politicians and military leaders should know a little geography, or at least a little geometry, and know that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. As usual, politicians are able to pretend not to understand irony and ignore it, and irony naturally does not cause any repercussions. But it seems that they are also a little unwilling to be ridiculed, and unintentionally or intentionally, often to show their understanding, arbitrarily display their ability to draw lines.

Perhaps there is a kind of geography education that calculates land not by area but by lines. Then it should not surprise us how we see a country of lines on the map. Vaguely speaking, its borders extend about 10,000 li from north to south and west to east, but we should never hope to estimate the area of its land from these approximate lengths and widths. If we feel that all real lines must have an area, then the width of this area is only one-one hundred and fiftieth of the length. If we put this on a map of the world with a scale of 1:40,000,000, then the shape of the Siberian Railway is exactly this length-to-width ratio.

We know that sometimes an imaginary line is enough to cause changes in world politics. Many people believe that the last World War was due to Germany's attempt to cut the three S lines, and the current turmoil around the Mediterranean is also aimed at attacking the three S lines. Italy is also thinking of creating another oblique three S line across North Africa from Sicily, through Sudan, to Somaliland. The three S lines are naturally often regarded as a very important line. However, the three S lines do not solely rely on a single line for connection. Both sides of the line are reflected by a vast background, while the country of lines can only form a thin line in its entirety. I don't know why they like to use the term lifeline. Perhaps they are self-aware that they only have a fragile line for life.

The maintenance of a line's life depends on the navy, which is criticized for being top-heavy. Being able to maintain a lifeline is already not easy, but those who are dreaming of a continental empire want to tie bombs to the line. They have already disregarded the fragility of the line itself, but still complain that the line is not long enough. The dream of extending the line originally existed, but the sudden desire to extend it at this time is still the result of mutual recrimination. On the whole, this only helps the function of tying bombs, but whether this extended weak line can be firmly tied to a small bomb depends on whether the troops pieced together by patching things up can scrape together something to find a burial place among the mountains. This island, which has little relationship with the continental war situation, still needs more than 100,000 troops in terms of restraining forces. The saying that there is no intention to occupy it for a long time, coming from the mouths of cunning people, although not credible at all, is not necessarily a retreat reserved for the lack of invading power.

The severe significance and impact of the invasion of Hainan Island on the Pacific situation is something we should naturally understand and believe, but we must also understand that it can by no means provide the impact that can be afforded by "easily occupying". When the troops are withdrawn because they cannot but retreat, we cannot believe any of their explanations. There is a passage in a short commentary in the Shanghai Translation News Weekly that we feel is worth introducing. The article says: "In the past, Japan's policy of quick war and quick surrender was to unite Wang Jingwei internally and to unite Germany externally, releasing harmonious air from time to time with ups and downs. Now he only uses the invasion of Hainan Island as an attempt to make his last quick knot. And this opinion, according to British Foreign Minister Cadogan, was instigated by Italy, but I even suspect that Wang Jingwei's opinion is also inside." Although we cannot hear Wang Jingwei's opinion at present, if Japan withdraws its troops, there will be people like Wang Jingwei who come out to speak. However, it is not necessarily a peace theory, or it is simply a puppet show.

Wang Jingwei once dreamed of being a puppet in Guangzhou, and at that time he had requested a withdrawal hoax. But his partners were not happy, probably because they felt that the puppet was not big enough. As for Hainan Island, which is "of no benefit to itself" and cannot be "easily occupied," it may be used to exchange puppets. However, it is only "perhaps," and if the puppet harbors this hope, it will inevitably be disillusioned. Since a line has been extended, it has naturally caused the illusion of thinking it is longer, so the result may be to drag it hard until it breaks.

### Old Man

— Li Liwen

The old man had been lingering on the ridge for quite some time. When he stumbled up this ridge, the sun was not yet directly overhead, and the vast sky with one or two drifting clouds was so blue and so high. But now, the sun had already slanted to the west, towards the peak of Banner Mountain on the other bank of the Songjiang River, where the turbid waters flowed, and a beautiful sunset glow quietly reflected in the golden rays of the evening. The old man, however, sat alone on the ridge, blankly puffing on his dry tobacco pipe, allowing his shattered and heavy heart to churn with endless waves of sorrow.

The old man… the old man’s life was woven with countless threads of hardship and suffering…

From a young age, the old man had been suffering in poverty. Initially, he and his early widowed mother painstakingly cultivated other people's fields. Years later, one day, his mother suddenly collapsed and died in the field while working. From then on, he cultivated the fields that five or six people used to work alone. The weight of a thousand pounds of stone pressed down on him, almost suffocating him, but he simply rubbed his body with medicated wine and kept his head down, inhaling the scent of the soil. It was not until he was nearly forty that he married a wife to help him. From then on, he became increasingly old and frail, but fortunately, his only son grew up and, like him in his younger days, endured hardships without complaint, tightly gripping the hoe. Thus, after enduring all kinds of hardships and suffering, the old man felt a little comfort. Therefore, during sleepless nights, when he took a break from work and leaned on the handle of his hoe, watching his son’s sturdy arms swing under the sunlight, a faint smile would gently bloom from the corners of the old man’s parched lips.

However, unexpectedly… it was truly a violent accident: like a sudden storm breaking a small flower that had just struggled to emerge from the thorns, the old man’s ray of comfort was suddenly shattered to pieces.

The events of this morning sent a chilling shiver down the old man’s spine as he thought about them…

His son had gotten up before dawn, splashed some water from the water tank and casually washed his face. Then, he picked up the sickle he had sharpened the night before and went to the fields to weed. After breakfast, he returned with muddy hands and feet, and then, carrying a fishing net, went to the big pond behind the house to catch fish.

It was at that moment that four “wooden shells” (gunmen) from the township office pointed to the old man’s house.

They were there to conscript his son.

But how could this be?

“I only have this one son! Without him, we would starve to death!” The old man pleaded mournfully.

Moreover, weren’t there many families in the village with three or four sons?

However, the township office did not care about these things…

"Will he go or not? If he doesn’t go… we’ll seize him."

Banging the table fiercely, the four guns pointed at him, and even if you were the only son, you had to go with them.

Was it kidnapping? Was it robbery?

The old man slumped weakly onto the table. A dark cloud, a flash of bright green, and a swirling mass of golden light appeared before his eyes.

His old wife wailed in a hoarse voice, tore off her headscarf, and banged her head against the wall with a thudding sound.

A chaotic jumble of thoughts swirled rapidly in the old man's mind—the old man suddenly widened his frightening eyes, and without saying a word, he rushed out of the gate, stumbling along the winding village path to the township office…

However, the township head sat majestically in his chair, "Money!" he spat. Without money, he was stern and unapproachable. The old man was thus dragged out of the township office gate, and the butt of the “wooden shell” even struck him on the head.

A mixture of anger and sorrow welled up, but the old man could not shed tears. He simply silently swallowed the unpayable hatred, and then, blankly, he set out on his journey home.

### Starting with Couplets

— Bing Xin

× People’s minds are magical, truly like mercury seeping into every crevice. In the occupied areas, not only must we be subjected to the tyranny of the enemy in terms of material life, but × people also drill in everywhere, even in religious beliefs, taking the opportunity to poison our minds. According to a newspaper report from the other day:

"Shanghai Special Dispatch, the puppet city government is approaching the time for the people to send off the Kitchen God. It has printed 100,000 images of the Kitchen God in color and sent them to residents in the four suburban areas. The images are embedded with slogans such as 'Japan-China-Manchukuo Cooperation, Nine Clans Harmonious' and couplets such as 'Respect the Kitchen God and sincerely pray for lasting celebrations and three meals a day, Cultivate Good Neighborliness and properly pray for the arrival of the Five Blessings...'"

This is the consistent style of slaves flattering their masters, and it is not at all surprising.

Originally, the usual couplets for sending off the Kitchen God in the north mostly wrote, "Report great words and good deeds above, protect peace and security in the world below." It seems that in addition to respecting ghosts and serving spirits, there was still no thought of quickly leaving the world and the country. However, these two sentences certainly left room for flattery in front of the × people’s slaves and lackeys. Naturally, in the current occupied areas, under the power of the × puppet regime, there is no "peace" to speak of. Then, when sending off the Kitchen God on the twenty-third evening, perhaps worshipping ghosts and respecting gods would evoke thoughts of the country. Therefore, clever slaves who flattered their masters came up with this good idea, so that the compatriots in the occupied areas would continue to revolve and think about things like "Japan-China-Manchukuo Cooperation" or "Cultivating Good Neighborliness," temporarily anesthetizing themselves.

There is no shortage of precedents for such things. I remember in the winter of the year of the "September 18th" Incident, the Japanese also forced all households in the Northeast to paste New Year couplets specially made by the Japanese police, writing things like "Fuse East Asian Ethnicities, One Heart, One Mind, Build a New Country Together, Coexist and Prosper," with the horizontal inscription being "Imperial Grace is Vast." In fact, the people who came up with the plan were still slaves doing the work of dogs, and the handwriting was still from the hands of the Chinese. The reason for killing traitors and running dogs is even more reliably justified here.

Recently, there has been a group of people who constantly spare no ink or effort in arguing over the few words "Advocating Peace Means Being a Traitor." On the surface of the words, although they repeatedly deny having any suspicion of being a traitor, judging from the saying "The more one argues, the more guilty one seems," their guilty and timid state has been completely exposed. In fact, the few words "Advocating Peace Means Being a Traitor" are still a sentence that needs to be explained and can be extended. If it were truly like the armistice conditions in the 27th issue of the Da Feng magazine, we would never close the door to negotiations. However, what is noteworthy is that it is clear that we have not been defeated, but a group of slaves insist that we have been defeated. It is clear that we cannot compromise and seek peace, but they have first agreed on the conditions with the × people, made their treacherous plans, and forcibly stamped the foreheads of the four hundred seventy million citizens with the mark of a conquered slave. This, then, is a 100% slave style.

The × people's tricks seem to have been exhausted today, because they have used them all, both hard and soft. What is extremely noteworthy are the slaves who act as accomplices to the tigers, who have endless methods of flattery, scheming, and poisoning China. They can stir up trouble, but they can also seize topics to make extended and far-fetched remarks, confusing the masses and anesthetizing the masses. However, if we start with the Shanghai municipal government's flattery in printing images of the Kitchen God and couplets, we can also infer the intentions and flattering style of the slaves. By understanding one thing, we can understand three things, and the future actions of the other × slaves can probably be predicted to some extent.

### A Small Opinion

— You Di

Regardless of north or south, regardless of old or young, everyone must strive for the War of Resistance. Therefore, the cultural circles in this port also need to stand in their own positions and start working. The task of cultural workers here is also to concentrate their efforts on eliminating traitors and striving for unity and upward mobility among the backward, promoting and coordinating the work of other departments, and developing the power of their weapons under the goal of defeating national × people and completing national liberation!

In the past, all work tasks had not been touched as tasks, and the work was scattered and disorganized. Especially after the "Wang incident" occurred, the inadequacy of the work and the poverty of power became even more apparent! Therefore, the issue of building a united front in the cultural world, which is currently being raised, should attract the attention and strength of all cultural workers in the port. Regarding this important issue, there is indeed a need for extensive discussion. Here, I would like to express a small opinion. My opinion is: the organization should be broad, and the work should be subdivided; use unity to develop work, and use work to consolidate unity.

First: From the literal meaning, the "Cultural United Front" must be a broad combination of the cultural circles. If the scope of the organization is small, it can only be called a "battle point." There are still many points besides it. This does not mean accumulating points into a line. What is needed is the collection of all points, standing in a horizontal row, each person holding a gun and aiming at the front × people, regardless of front or back, firing bullets together. This is the battle line. Not only is there a main brain, but more importantly, there must be troops. Not only must all progressive and energetic new people gather on the front line, but also the doors must be opened to attract the backward and transform them, because their feet are firmly planted in another group. If they do a good job, the harvest will be quite considerable. Otherwise, it will not become a "United Front." But the "United Front" is not a "den of complacency." If there are decadent and rebellious elements within the front line, or elements that cannot be transformed, they must be eliminated without leniency; otherwise, it will not even qualify as a "front line." This is the military annotation to the need for a broad organization.

Second: With an organization and work, the principles of the work need to be determined together by everyone, and a program should be established; but the specifics of the work cannot be done without division of labor. There is no "jack-of-all-trades" in the world, so everyone can only choose what they are familiar with and do it. Within the battle line, the division of labor can be as detailed as possible, establishing many special research and work departments, where workers can have their regular places of effort. However, all departments need to have close ties, so that all work can be for the same purpose. At present, it is best not to give Mr. Hua Wei-style workers the opportunity to estimate things. Work is something that can be "firmly and steadily established." "Jack-of-all-trades" not only do not do things well, but they are truly unable to do them. Therefore, the work must be subdivided.

Third: Since the organization is broad, internal unity becomes a major issue. There must be a vertical system within the battle line, and there must also be horizontal connections. Each member is a single iron ring, connected to form an iron chain, a tight line. Only in this way can there be struggle. Not only must there be unity within each department in order to work, but each department, in other words, the entire battle line, must have the greatest unity in order to make the work progress according to plan. In terms of existing groups, the only shortcoming is that they are a ragtag army. The participants have not yet recognized who their comrades are. The situation is like scattered sand, which makes it impossible to work. At the same time, we can make further observations and know that it is not enough to rely on gatherings to unite a broad battle line. Every member must participate in the work and be able to obtain the true meaning of the struggle in the work. And in the process of work, make everyone get collective review, criticism, and guidance. Under this urgent need of everyone, the closest unity will inevitably be produced. Conversely, without work, there is no way to unite all kinds of people, people who know each other and people who do not know each other. At this time, the members within the battle line are comrades in the meeting, and after the meeting, they are individuals who have nothing to do with the organization. And the organization is left with a sign—therefore, unity and work are closely related. Without unity, there is no way to work, and without work, there is no way to unite. The only slogan is: Use unity to develop work; use work to consolidate unity.

### The Way Out for Educated Youth

— Mao Lie

Originally, our country has many strong men, and the source of soldiers is not a problem at all. There is no need for educated youth to join the military with guns. Therefore, Ms. Song Meiling recently published an article saying that students only need to directly or indirectly awaken the anti-Japanese consciousness of the people during the war and improve the lives of the people, which is enough.

However, these words are Ms. Song's intention to care for educated youth, that is, the path of educated youth to serve the country is even better than being a soldier, not that they absolutely do not need to be soldiers. Therefore, if we combine her words with Chairman Chiang's order the other day urging the children of party and government personnel to join the army enthusiastically, we can discover that their intentions are exactly the same: every educated youth should shoulder the responsibility of saving the country, either going to the front line to fight or engaging in national salvation movements in the rear. The children of party and government personnel are of course all educated youth. Since the War of Resistance, although Chiang Ching-kuo's leading troops and fighting and the death of Vice Chairman Feng's eldest son in Nanyuan are enough to set an example for these children, there must still be a majority who are living in a drunken stupor or living in leisure. Chairman Chiang wants them all to enlist in the army, not only to set an example for the people, but also to strengthen the strength of the War of Resistance. In fact, he has clearly designated another way for educated youth to serve the country. We maintain this position.

I think that every educated youth who can go to the front line to fight should go to the front line to fight, and those who can be active in the rear should be active in the rear. These are the two paths they should take now. Reading, studying hard, and doing everything possible to engage in national salvation, of course, can also be included in the scope of rear activities. Educated youth, cherish this opportunity, do not give up your responsibilities.

However, in my personal opinion, it is better for educated youth to do their best on the front line than to do their best in the rear. Because hiding in the rear, it is inevitable to have the suspicion of avoiding responsibility, and there will be abuses of abandoning responsibility. I think their influence will be very great, whether on the front line or in the rear, once they go to the front line. Chairman Chiang's order may have some meaning in this regard!
