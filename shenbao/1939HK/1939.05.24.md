### The Rule of Law in Shanghai

Due to an unreasonable oppression by × forces, four Shanghai newspapers have been severely penalized. The reasons for these penalties differ in their subject, their methods, their severity, and even in their stated justifications. The common factor is that all are vibrant Chinese-language newspapers operated by British and American businesses. Such a sweeping action is only seen in any country during periods of radical change in the national system, political system, or regime. In Shanghai, however, there is no precedent for this. Therefore, it cannot be assessed based on common sense or normal circumstances. Furthermore, these four newspapers are being penalized by formal public institutions; thus, they must be regarded as exercises of legal authority. On the other hand, whether these actions are political, administrative, or police-related, their nature is flexible. Whether they are legal or illegal, within or exceeding jurisdiction, appropriate or excessive, there must be principles to determine right and wrong, but a single perspective cannot be applied. Regardless of the nature of the penalty or whether it is right or wrong, once an issue has become a matter of legal authority, no private opinions or subjective emotions are allowed to be used to assess it before it is resolved according to the law, within the scope of legal authority, and after legal action has been taken. This is the realm of modern rule of law and freedom of speech, and no deviation is permitted. Regarding those four newspapers, they cause us extreme distress and almost suffocate us.

We respect the spirit of the rule of law and cannot advocate for the content of the cases when the four newspapers become legal cases. However, we must loudly call for the rule of law!

To discuss the rule of law in Shanghai is not to suggest that the Shanghai authorities have already acted in an unlawful or chaotic manner. Rather, Shanghai's situation seems to lead people to doubt whether rigidly adhering to established laws is sufficient to adapt to the environment. In this helpless situation, it seems that insisting on everything according to law is an unrealistic high ideal. Therefore, the only option is to seek extra-legal solutions through so-called understanding and cooperation. This kind of painstaking effort is sincerely understood by those who are enlightened. However, will the consequences be slightly better or worse? Those who believe in the rule of law must have a normal and clear answer to this question. What is difficult to answer is how to cope with the precarious present and how to avoid direct action and its associated disturbances and crises. The reason why truth and facts conflict lies in the fact that the very foundation of Shanghai is being shaken. However, if the foundation is shaken, wavering in faith is inevitable. In fact, if the foundation is shaken to the point of collapse, it cannot be saved by the rule of law. If the skin is gone, where will the hair attach? There is no law or governance to speak of. If one seeks governance by destroying the law, it is like climbing a tree to catch fish. Moreover, wavering in the belief in the rule of law will only exacerbate the shaking of the foundation. This is a truth that must align with reality.

As of today, regarding the fundamental issues of Shanghai, both the United States and the United Kingdom have issued clear statements, advocating that everything concerning Shanghai should be based on the Land Regulations. The Land Regulations are an international treaty, and based on the treaty is international rule of law. This kind of advocacy must be implemented in the most reasonable and thorough manner, and the shaking of Shanghai's foundation will inevitably return to stability as a result. With the foundation stable, not only should the rule of law be respected internally, but there is also a greater possibility of rigorously enforcing the rule of law. Therefore, we have a message for the authorities of the Shanghai International Settlement: up until today, all measures taken within the Settlement, whether trusted and appreciated or suspected and resented by residents of various countries within the Settlement, have not yet been subject to disputes about legality. Therefore, it is still easy to promote the rule of law and develop its spirit from today onward. The key is for the authorities to show everyone that they respect the rule of law and lead by example. Then, no one will dare to make extra-legal demands of the authorities. To show respect for the rule of law, the legal basis for each measure should be clearly explained to everyone, ensuring that everyone understands the legality of the measures and is happy to accept the rule of law. For example, the case of the four newspapers is unprecedented in Shanghai, and therefore requires explanation.

### The Anti-Japanese Base Area Government in Southeastern Shanxi

— Ke Han

(Special Contribution) The Anti-Japanese base area in Southeastern Shanxi includes nineteen counties that are often maintained complete and twenty-three incomplete counties. The majority of these incomplete counties are located on the Tongpu Railway Line, with half of their territory in western Shanxi and the other half in Southeastern Shanxi. This vast area is home to five million people, accounting for one-third of the thirteen million people in all of Shanxi. Economically, it is the wealthiest area in all of Shanxi. Geographically, it is shielded by the Taihang Mountains to the east and the Taiyue Mountains to the west, with the Xicheng, Wangwu, Lutai, Zhongtiao, and Bafu ranges surrounding it to the north and south. The surrounding mountains provide an ideal location for establishing an anti-Japanese base area. Furthermore, due to the high elevation of the Taihang Mountains, it can control Hebei and Shandong provinces to the east. The terrain also makes it the anti-Japanese base area among the anti-Japanese base areas. Today, the general command post for guerrilla warfare in North China is located here. This vast area is also the first line of defense for protecting the Great Northwest. As the ancient saying goes, "He who gains Shangdang gains the world." Shangdang is Southeastern Shanxi, centered on Changzhi (formerly known as Luanfu), and the world, of course, is Central Plains of Henan.

Since the fall of Fen, the entire Southeastern Shanxi has been transferred to × rear area. Since then, Southeastern Shanxi has made rapid and substantial progress in all aspects of construction, including military, political, economic, cultural and educational, and people's movement, creating unprecedented prosperity and vigorous atmosphere in the history of Southeastern Shanxi. Everyone who comes to North China × rear area for inspection is willing to visit Southeastern Shanxi first. In the recent period, it has attracted many Chinese and foreign reporters, literary workers, photographers, and artists. They organized war zone news service teams, visiting groups, and inspection teams, preparing to introduce everything they saw and heard in Southeastern Shanxi to the whole country and the world. They also brought cameras to film every moving scene, preparing to take them back to the rear for screening. Indeed, everything in Southeastern Shanxi is ordinary, but it is new and fresh when people consider that this is in × rear area.

Each aspect in Southeastern Shanxi has its own significant progress, and the most important progress is the enlightened local government. The progress of the political structure in Southeastern Shanxi not only promoted progress in other aspects and constituted the main reason for the progress of other aspects, but also promoted the political progress of the entire Shanxi. Today, the progress in other areas of Shanxi is not as much influenced by the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region as it is influenced by Southeastern Shanxi.

The highest administrative organs responsible for leading Southeastern Shanxi are mainly the Commissioner's Offices of the Third and Fifth Administrative Regions. The commissioner of the Third Administrative Region is Mr. Bo Yibo, and the commissioner of the Fifth Administrative Region is Mr. Rong Zihe (Wu Sheng). They are both relatively progressive and enlightened figures under the leadership of Commander Yan. They manage nineteen complete counties and several incomplete counties. The former's governing area is in the north, shielding the × people on the Zhengtai Road. The latter's governing area is in the south, with its main gateway being Dongyangguan. The other twenty or so counties on the Tongpu Railway Line, which only have half of their area, are centered on Hongtong and are under the jurisdiction of the Sixth Administrative Region. South of Hongtong to the Yellow River, the Seventh Administrative Region governs. The Commissioner's Offices are located west of the Tongpu Road, while their offices are established east of the road, close to the railway. Below the Commissioner's Offices, an organized administrative system is arranged from the county to the village in an orderly manner.

Today, aside from the government's achievements in maintaining social order, raising huge amounts of financial and economic supplies for the Death Squads, guerrilla teams, and all local armed forces, implementing national defense education, and mobilizing the people to participate in the war, let alone, in terms of the administrative structure itself, it has the following characteristics:

First, the political power is unified, with unified leadership and unified work steps. This means not only that the local political power in Southeastern Shanxi is unified under the leadership of the central government and Commander Yan, but also that Southeastern Shanxi itself is unified in terms of political power. The two main highest administrative organs in Southeastern Shanxi, the Third and Fifth Administrative Regions, have close ties with each other. Commissioners Bo Yibo and Rong Zihe not only consult on everything and share the same opinions, but also organized an Administrative Joint Conference, which is held regularly once a month to discuss and arrange the administrative work in Southeastern Shanxi. Therefore, the pace of administrative work is uniform, and the leadership style is consistent. The establishment of this regular joint conference has not been long, it was decided at the conference supporting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but today we can already see its effectiveness. Recently, the Third and Fifth Administrative Regions' work arrangements for welcoming × new offensive have the same basic policies and work, except for some differences due to different specific circumstances. In particular, everyone put forward the same slogans in terms of working methods. The unification of leadership and the unification of work steps will enable the administrative organs to exert their effectiveness even more, and will enable the administrative work to be carried out even more smoothly in the future. Originally, the unification of administrative and military command in the × rear area is equally important, because many problems, such as financial and economic problems and the system of trade control, can only be done more satisfactorily and reasonably with a unified policy, unified steps, and mutual cooperation.

The organizational form of the Administrative Joint Conference has not been found anywhere else, but it is indeed the best form for achieving unity and contact in work under the leadership of different local administrative officials. This is the first characteristic of the Southeastern Shanxi regime.

Second, it is the implementation of democratic politics. In Shanxi, democracy was quickly proposed by Commander Yan. Before the War of Resistance, Commander Yan advocated the will of the people supervising the government, but it was not valued by the local administrative personnel at that time and was not fully utilized. Only Southeastern Shanxi is making efforts to implement democratic politics today. As of the time the reporter wrote this article, three-quarters of the village chiefs and vice chiefs in the Third Administrative Region were elected by the villagers' congress. In the Fifth Administrative Region, two-thirds of the village chiefs and vice chiefs were elected. In some places, even district chiefs and office managers are elected. This is an outstanding achievement in the national scope. Enlightened administrative officials are more willing to gradually progress to the point where county magistrates can also be elected by the people.

They not only give the people this real right to vote and be elected, but also give the people the indirect right of recall. Administrative organs can respect the will of the people as much as possible, and humbly consider and accept the opinions of the masses. In the past, when the reporter first arrived in Southeastern Shanxi, the administrative organs in the Fifth Administrative Region still contained some corrupt elements left over from the past. They did not care about the interests of the people, and even suppressed the people, hindering the development of the people's movement, causing the people's disgust and opposition. Therefore, petitions from the people to the higher-level governments occurred frequently. For example, the people of Lingchuan and Gaoping counties gathered thousands of people to trek to the Changzhi Commissioner's Office to submit petitions. When such a petition movement occurs, administrative officials will definitely come out of the "government gate": they will meet them outside the gate, then give them a comforting speech, and invite their representatives to stay and await his response to the issue. When they investigate and find that their subordinates have indeed committed illegal and bad deeds as accused by the people, they will immediately replace the accused without mercy. These concrete facts of truly understanding the people's sentiments and accepting the people's opinions have improved the people's attention to and concern for the government. In Southeastern Shanxi, there is a popular saying among the people: "Now it's different. Ordinary people can also come out and say a word!" Indeed, how many times in thousands of years have the people of Shanxi had such an opportunity to stand up and speak!

The government also gives the people the opportunity to participate in politics. This is the establishment of the administrative conference. When this organization was established, local administrative officials openly stated to the people that this was the preparation for the local councils. The councils at all levels in Shanxi should have been established in January of this year according to the decision of the Central National Political Council, but due to various difficulties, they have not yet been established. The local government in Southeastern Shanxi then temporarily replaced the local councils with administrative conferences. Administrative conferences have been organized in both the administrative region and various counties. The county magistrate serves as the chairman of each county's administrative conference. In addition, the representatives participating in the administrative conference are divided into two types: representatives of people's organizations and representatives elected by popular vote from the districts. The representatives of the administrative conference include two representatives from the Sacrifice to Save the Nation League, two from the Gongzhantuan, three from the Farmers' Salvation Association, and two each from the Workers' Salvation, Youth Salvation, Women's Salvation, and Education Salvation Associations, and three representatives from the gentry. District representatives are elected by popular vote from each district, three from each district. In order to improve the status of women, it is also stipulated that among the three representatives elected from each district, at least one must be a female representative. Within the scope of the Fifth Administrative Region, there are many ethnic minorities - Hui people - in Changzhi, Jincheng, and Changzi. Therefore, it is also specially stipulated that areas with a certain number of Hui residents should have Hui representatives participating in the administrative conference. Therefore, Hui compatriots have expressed such emotions: "Only in Southeastern Shanxi can the Hui people be so valued by the Han people." The administrative conference is invisibly the highest organization for deciding local administration. Through the administrative conference, the people can review and criticize the work of the government, and put forward opinions to discuss, study, and decide on the government's administrative policies. The administrative conference is also an organization for the government and the people to directly contact each other. The government's decisions can be conveyed to the people through the representatives of the administrative conference, so that the people can understand the government's will and sincerely implement the government's resolutions and support the government. The will of the people can also be reflected to the government through the representatives of the administrative conference. In the administrative conferences held in various counties, they often closed with enthusiastic shouts of slogans and cheers. Their slogans mainly supported the government and supported ××× county magistrate. The reason is that the county magistrate accepted their criticisms and adopted their opinions in the meeting. The administrative conference brought the government and the people closer together.

Implementing democratic politics is the second characteristic of politics in Southeastern Shanxi, and also the greatest advantage.

Third, is the attention to improving people's livelihoods. A long time ago, the local government in Southeastern Shanxi promulgated the "two-five reduction of rent, five-one reduction of interest" decrees, and these decrees have been widely implemented in Southeastern Shanxi, with preliminary results. Due to the cruel ravages of the × invasion of Southeastern Shanxi in nine routes, Southeastern Shanxi has generated many victims of the disaster. In addition to those released by the central government, the government also pays special attention to the work of relieving the victims of the disaster. In this regard, special relief committees have been established in various counties to raise funds to be distributed to various places. It is estimated that each county assists more than 300 disaster victims every day. The administrative authorities also put forward slogans: "If people starve to death in the village, the village chief is responsible. If people starve to death in the district, the district chief is responsible. If people starve to death in the county, the county magistrate is responsible." Under this slogan, the phenomenon of starvation has indeed never occurred, and local governments at all levels are working diligently to rescue victims. At the same time, they also advocated the method of "villages saving villages," which has had a great effect. However, this is only the negative aspect. On the other hand, the government has also established low-interest loan offices in various villages, implementing small-scale lending, and creating cooperative societies and small-scale handicraft factories to relieve unemployment. The capital of low-interest loan offices is usually around one hundred yuan, but relying on this one hundred yuan, many poor and helpless people have the opportunity to earn a living. The Lunar New Year is coming soon, and the Shangdang Bank has specially allocated tens of thousands of yuan for low-interest loans. I have never seen a local government pay so much attention to the lives of the people. This concern for people's livelihoods has greatly increased the people's goodwill towards the government, making the people sincerely think that today's government is indeed their own government. At the same time, the improvement of people's livelihoods has mobilized the people one after another.

Fourth, is the improvement and strengthening of the administrative structure itself. This can also be divided into two aspects: one is the structure itself, and the other is the allocation of talent.

In terms of structure, governments at all levels have become powerful organizations. In the past, the county government only had three sections: administration, finance, and education. Now, it has added two sections: people's movement and armed forces. The addition of these two sections allows the government to not only manage general local administrative work, but also have organs to mobilize and arm the people, and to focus on leadership and actively exert the power of the government to make the government's structure suitable for wartime leadership.

### Recent Developments in Our Country's Education and Culture

Continued from yesterday

Implementing Policies for Prostitutes

(6) Promoting Adult Education for Prostitutes: Recently, there have been frequent reports about prostitutes saving the nation. Therefore, it is necessary to promote education among them to enhance their conviction in resisting the enemy. Liuzhou Special District currently has 133 prostitutes, and it is planned to divide them into three classes and assign personnel to teach them. (7) Performance Evaluation: In every village and street, all men and women between the ages of 18 and 45 should learn as adults. Without hindering their daily work, they should attend classes for two hours each day (men and women taught separately). They will graduate in two months, and the government will issue graduation certificates. Textbooks will be provided by the government. Those with excellent graduation results will be selected by the county government at the end of this year's adult classes, ranging from five to twenty people, and will be awarded bonuses or certificates to encourage them. Those who refuse to attend school or fail to supervise effectively will be punished according to the provincial regulations, depending on the severity. Following the steps outlined above, the county government will supervise the townships, the townships will supervise the villages and streets, and the villages and streets will encourage the masses to actively enroll in school. With this level-by-level effort, I believe that the 18,767 illiterate people in Liuzhou can be eliminated within this year.

Overseas Education

The Ministry of Education Investigates and Statistics General Situations from the Past

(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The situation of Chinese overseas education has recently been thoroughly investigated and statistically analyzed by the Ministry of Education. The following is a summary:

Evolution of Overseas Study: China officially began sending students abroad in the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign, selecting young children to go to the United States. In the first year of the Guangxu reign, four groups of 120 people were sent. Later, due to disagreements between the minister and the supervisor, the students were recalled in the seventh year of the Guangxu reign. It was not until the twenty-second year of the Guangxu reign that 13 government-sponsored students were sent to Japan. In the twenty-fourth year, Zhang Zhidong sent 30 students to Japan to study military affairs. Since then, students have been sent every year, and the number of self-funded students has also increased. At that time, there were as many as 15,000 students in Japan. In the thirty-first year, the Japanese side planned to promulgate regulations to restrict foreign students. The students strongly opposed this and returned to China one after another, and the number of people decreased sharply. However, the rules were not promulgated, and many went to Japan again to resume their studies. At this time, very few students were sent to study in the West, and there were very few self-funded students. In the thirty-third year, the Qing government announced the purpose of education and sent the education commissioners of various provinces to Japan to study the preparations for learning. The Ministry of Education and the Japanese Ministry of Education signed a special agreement for five schools, and the number of students sent to Japan by the provinces was limited. After the Xinhai Revolution, almost all the students in Japan returned to China to participate in the revolutionary movement. Since the United States returned the Boxer Indemnity and established Tsinghua School, more and more students have been going to Europe and the United States. In the 14th year of the Republic, Tsinghua was changed to a university, and the method of sending all students to the United States was stopped. Instead, a general examination method was adopted. According to statistics, the school had sent more than 1,900 students successively. The number of students sent by various provinces also increased. After the first year of the Republic, the number of students in Japan fluctuated. In the fourth year of the Republic, Japan forced the Twenty-One Demands, and the students in Japan were enraged and returned to China. In the 13th year of the Republic, China and Japan signed the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement, and a quota for the Boxer Indemnity subsidy was established. The number of students in Japan increased year by year. Although the Ministry of Education decided to abolish the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement in the 19th year, there was still an increase in the number of students going to Japan.

Among the European countries, France has the largest number of Chinese students, especially after the European War, the number of students working and studying frugally increased sharply to a peak of 1,600. Later, with the establishment of the Sino-French University in Lyon, it became more convenient to study in France. In the 14th and 15th years of the Republic, Soviet Russia established Sun Yat-sen University. At that time, the Guangdong government sent students to study in Russia, but this was soon stopped. In the 21st year of the Republic, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Repayment Committee annually set a quota for government-funded students in the UK, and the committee separately selected students through examinations. This has been done for six sessions.

Management of Overseas Studies: Regarding the management of overseas studies, two supervisors were assigned to the young students sent to the United States in the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign. In fact, they were overseas study supervisors. The dispatch of students to Japan was initially mostly entrusted to Japanese to be responsible for education and management. In the third year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education sent one supervisor, and each province sent one or several managers, or several provinces sent one manager, to manage the affairs of students in Japan. In the fourth year of the Republic, supervisors were set up to manage students in Europe, but the affairs of students in Russia were still managed by the embassy in Russia. In the fifth year of the Republic, supervisors were set up to manage students in the United States. After the establishment of the National Government, the supervision of students in Japan was still being established, until it was temporarily cancelled after the outbreak of the War of Resistance. The supervision of students in Europe and the United States has ceased to be set up.

Qualifications for Overseas Study: Chinese students going abroad to study should be limited to those who cannot receive appropriate guidance and equipment in China and are needed by the country. Before the 21st year of the Republic, foreign students only needed to have a high school degree or above in China. Since the promulgation of regulations in the 22nd year, the qualifications have been raised. "Government-funded students" must have one of the following qualifications: (1) Graduates of public or registered private colleges or universities in China or abroad, and have held technical positions related to the subject of study for more than two years. (2) Graduates of public or registered private colleges or universities in China or abroad who have continued to study the subject for more than two years and have valuable specialized works or other achievements. (3) Graduates of public or registered private universities or independent colleges in China or abroad with excellent grades. "Self-funded students" must have one of the following qualifications: (1) Graduates of public or registered private colleges or universities. (2) Graduates of public or registered private senior vocational schools who have held technical positions in China for more than two years.

Evaluation of Overseas Study: In recent years, the Ministry of Education has tightened the selection of government-funded students, and the subjects of study are mostly agreed upon in advance with the dispatching agencies. In addition to raising qualifications for self-funded students going abroad, most provinces have scholarships to subsidize self-funded students with excellent grades. Students studying abroad must submit research results on time, and after returning to China, they must submit credentials to the Ministry of Education and apply for registration. All these regulations make the management of students more strict than before. The subjects studied by students are mainly practical subjects such as science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine for government-funded students. This principle has been followed for several years, and the number of self-funded students studying practical subjects has also increased year by year.

Number of Students Studying Abroad: Taking the recent ten years (from the 18th year to the 27th year) as an example, there were a total of 7,545 people, including 6,781 self-funded students and 764 government-funded students. Government-funded students accounted for about one-ninth of the number of self-funded students. In terms of each year, the 18th year had the largest number of self-funded students (1,568) because the regulations on qualifications for studying abroad were looser at that time, so more people went abroad. The 27th year had the least (33), which was due to the restrictions on studying abroad due to the war. The 23rd year had the largest number of government-funded students (141) because it was the construction period, so more government-funded students were selected. The 27th year had the fewest (26), which was also due to the restrictions on studying abroad. In terms of country, the United States had the most government-funded students (319), followed by the United Kingdom (220). Italy, Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands had the fewest. Except for Japan (before the war), the United States also had the most self-funded students (526), followed by France. The Netherlands had the fewest. Over the past ten years (from the 18th year to the 27th year), a total of 597 students (including 220 government-funded) received overseas study certificates in the UK, 600 in Germany (82 government-funded), 706 in France (34 government-funded), 188 in Belgium (13 government-funded), 24 in Italy (2 government-funded), 40 in Sweden and Switzerland (2 government-funded), 25 in Austria (self-funded), 6 in Denmark (2 government-funded), 3 in the Netherlands (2 government-funded), 1,845 in the United States (319 government-funded), 14 in Canada (self-funded), 3,483 in Japan (84 government-funded), 10 in Egypt (self-funded), 3 in India (self-funded), 12 in the Philippines (self-funded), and 16 in other countries (4 government-funded). In total, 7,545 people studied abroad in the past ten years, including 764 government-funded students and 6,781 self-funded students.

External Culture

Participating in International Conferences and Promoting Cooperative Undertakings

(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) China's participation in the League of Nations' cultural undertakings dates back to the 19th year of the Republic. Recently, the League of Nations initiated the revision of the International Convention on Cultural Cooperation to make cultural cooperation among countries closer. The League of Nations obtained China's consent and invited Li Shizeng to represent China in formally signing the convention in Paris in December of the 27th year. After the signing of this convention, the exchange of cultural undertakings and information among the member countries will be more convenient, which will be especially beneficial to China. The Ministry of Education's past cooperation with international cultural affairs is summarized below:

Participating in International Academic Conferences

Before the War of Resistance, the important international academic conferences in which China participated included the International Public Education Conference, the International Art History Conference, the International Dialect Conference, the General Assembly of the International Committee on Cultural Cooperation, the International Religious Conference, and the French Descartes Conference. After attending the conferences, all representatives submitted written reports, which were forwarded by the Ministry of Education to relevant agencies and organizations for reference. During the War of Resistance, external publicity was particularly important. China participated in a total of seven international academic conferences: (1) The 13th International Congress on the Protection of Children in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, in June of the 27th year, attended by Xu Ze, a secretary of the embassy in Germany. (2) The International Congress of Philosophy, Science, and General Culture in Mexico in June of last year, attended by personnel from the embassy in Mexico. (3) The Seventh International Conference on Education in Geneva in July of last year, attended by Xie Shoukang. (4) The International Technical Education Conference in Berlin in July of last year, attended by Xie Shoukang. (5) The Second World Youth Congress in New York, USA, in August of last year, attended by a Chinese delegation of 29 people. (6) The Eighth International Congress of Historical Sciences in Switzerland in August of the 7th year, attended by Hu Shi. (7) The 20th World Oriental Studies Conference in Beijing in September of last year, attended by Xie Shoukang.

Selecting and Exchanging Students

In the spring of the 25th year, the Polish government requested the Chinese government to select a student to study in Poland, with the tuition and accommodation fees subsidized by Poland and the round-trip travel expenses subsidized by the Ministry of Education. The request was accepted, and Fang Fusen, an assistant teacher in the School of Engineering of Tsinghua University, was selected to study road engineering. He will soon complete his studies and return to serve the country. In the 16th year, the Ministry of Education, at the request of the German International Academic Exchange Office, decided to jointly organize the exchange of students between China and Germany. In the first year, it was decided to exchange six students first. The exchange schools in China were Central University, Peking University, Wuhan University, Jiaotong University, and Shanghai Medical College. In Germany, the International Academic Exchange Office was responsible for the arrangement. After the approval of the exchange of students between the two countries, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, which affected the start date of the school. Therefore, the German students coming to China were temporarily postponed, and only a few Chinese students went to Germany. In addition, Italy also requested to exchange students with China and sent students to China.

Establishing International Cultural Organizations

In order to promote cultural relations between China and foreign countries, the Ministry of Education has successively approved the establishment of cultural associations such as the Sino-British, Sino-Polish, Sino-German, and Sino-Soviet associations, organized by Chinese and foreign academics, and provided guidance and supervision at any time. The important work of each association over the years includes the selection and sending of interns by the China-America Cultural Association, the exchange of Sino-British lectures, the publication of Sino-Soviet culture and other publications by the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, the holding of film exhibitions and book exhibitions, the establishment of the Soviet Union Research Committee, the exchange of students by the Sino-Polish and Sino-German cultural associations, and the publication of introductions. These not only promote cultural ties between the two countries but also benefit the friendship between the two countries. In addition, in order to uphold the purposes and policies of the League of Nations, the League of Nations Association, which was previously established in Peiping by Chinese academics, also moved south in the winter of the 24th year, improved its organization, and continued to operate. The association has been actively engaged in upholding the League of Nations in the past two years and has achieved considerable results.

Exchanging International Publications

China officially joined the International Convention for the Exchange of Publications in the 14th year of the Republic. The Ministry of Education's International Exchange Office for Publications is currently in charge of the matter. In the 25th year, 36 countries joined the exchange agreement, and in the 26th year, Queensland, Latvia, and El Salvador were added, totaling 39 countries. There are also non-official exchange countries that exchange publications through the office, including Canada, South Africa, the Philippines, and various territories, totaling dozens of locations. In the two years before the war, the number of items exchanged by the office at home and abroad was: (1) 246 boxes and 237 packages of books received from various countries and transferred to domestic agencies; (2) 73 boxes and 16,729 packages of paintings received from domestic agencies and transferred to various countries; (3) 113 boxes and 859 packages of books and documents sent to various countries; (4) 111 boxes and 5,600 packages of books and documents sent to domestic agencies. In addition, during the War of Resistance, the number of items exchanged by the office at home and abroad was: (1) 77 boxes and 28 packages of books and documents received from various countries and transferred to domestic agencies; (2) 538 packages of books and documents sent to foreign agencies; (3) 4 boxes and 10 packages of books and documents received from domestic agencies and transferred to various countries; (4) 3 boxes and 1,560 packages of books and documents sent to foreign agencies. In addition, the Chinese Institute of the University of Frankfurt in Germany is still subsidized by China with 5,000 yuan annually, and the Chinese Institute has been established at the International University of India with the support of China. In the future, if the funding for international cultural undertakings can be increased, the cultural cooperation between China and other countries will be gradually expanded. The Chinese International Art Exhibition held in London, England, has enabled Europeans and Americans to have a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and enhance China's international status.

### Our Army in Northern Hubei Advances Victoriously Riding the Momentum; The Enemy Admits That the Invasion of Xiangfan Has Failed; Chen Cheng Returns from the Front Lines to Discuss the War Situation

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 22nd] Our army in northern Hubei is still attacking Suizhou, which is very smooth. The enemy is resisting stubbornly with reinforcements, and the battle situation is fierce. The remnants of the enemy in the Dabie Mountains are under our siege and suppression. The enemy in Changshoudian, Zhongxiang, and Fangjiaji Huangpilong is attempting to cross the Xiang River, which we are strictly guarding against. In recent days, we have been attacking Fangjiaji and the southwest of Changshoudian, and the fierce battle with the enemy is intense. A part of the enemy is counterattacking Fengle River, and we are severely attacking them.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 23rd] General Chen Cheng has returned to this place yesterday after inspecting various lines. When he met with reporters, he said that since the abandonment of Wuhan, the Japanese army has not gained any military victory except for the capture of Nanchang, and the Chinese army has instead taken the initiative. In the vicinity of Nanchang, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. Since the end of last month, the Japanese army has encountered a counterattack from the Chinese army in Gao'an and Wuyu, suffering heavy casualties. Although the Chinese army has not won any major victories, it has been enough to contain the Japanese army and prevent the transfer of troops from other fronts to attack Hubei Province. Now, the transportation on the Nanchang-Xunyang route has been cut off by the Chinese army, and the two highways south of Nanchang are still in the hands of the Chinese army. Various goods can enter the interior from the coast. He also said that there are currently about three and a half divisions of the Japanese army in Hubei Province. With such a small number of troops, it is impossible to threaten the Chinese army. All the Japanese troops in China, totaling about 33 divisions, still feel insufficient. It is not that they cannot make an offensive plan, but that they are unable to control the occupied areas for a long time. Finally, General Chen said that although there is no start to the recovery of large cities, this is due to strategic relations.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] News from Shanghai: According to the Japanese military authorities, it was reported today that the Japanese army, which advanced in northern Hubei and southern Henan in early May, has now retreated to its original positions south of the Dabie Mountains. According to a spokesman, the reason for the Japanese army's retreat is that the Chinese army is numerous and cannot be defeated by a small number of troops. Moreover, the terrain in the area is easy to defend, and the Japanese army's transportation of military supplies is also quite difficult due to the active Chinese army.

[Special Dispatch from Guilin, This Newspaper, 23rd] At the beginning of this month, General Zhang Fakui personally visited Jinhua and held an important military meeting with Bai Chongxi, Huang Shaoxiong, Liu Jianxu, Gu Zhutong, Tang Shengzhi, etc. Many important cases were resolved. Among them, it was specifically decided to simultaneously launch offensives in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Guangdong provinces to contain a large number of Japanese soldiers, so that they could not be transferred to other battlefields. Important instructions were also given on the anti-Japanese deployment in the southeastern provinces.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 23rd] At 1:30 pm on the 22nd, 12 enemy planes in four batches spied on Qujiang Wengyuan. Nine planes dropped dozens of bombs near Yutou Village, southwest of Qingyuan, destroying more than ten houses and injuring several villagers.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 23rd] At noon on the 22nd, dozens of enemy soldiers in Taipingchang advanced towards Mayazhuang from Hejiapu and Bohe in the northwest. They were severely attacked by our troops, and the enemy immediately fled back to their original route.

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 23rd] About 3,000 enemies in Woqu, southern Shanxi, launched an attack on us in two groups at dawn on the 1st, under the cover of planes and artillery. Our capable troops have divided up to meet them.

Puppet Troops Turn Against the Enemy One After Another

[Pingbao News Agency, Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 20th] Nanhe in Hebei Province was severely attacked by us and retreated into the city. We recovered Haojiaqiao. After the entire unit of Xu Bingli, the battalion commander of the guard of the puppet army Li Ying, turned against the enemy, the authorities gave a reward of 10,000 yuan and reorganized them. Many puppet soldiers are contacting us to turn against the enemy, and the entire enemy formation is shaking.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 22nd] The enemy in Laiwu, Shandong Province, invaded the south and was repelled by us, killing more than 100 enemies. Yesterday, our guerrillas attacked the Jiaoji Railway, Weixian County, and Qingzhou, and captured many prisoners.

### The Enemy's Oppression of Foreign Merchants in China Is Increasing; Restricting the Navigation of Foreign Ships Along Our Coast; Using Customs to Coerce Foreign Ships to Obtain Permits from the Enemy; The British Authorities Attach Great Importance to This

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 23rd, 11:15 AM] Mr. Lida, the acting deputy tax commissioner of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, stated to foreign officials that after next Thursday (June 1st), all foreign ships sailing along the coast of China must carry a permit from the Japanese Navy; otherwise, they will be subject to arrest by the Japanese Navy. However, Mr. Lida, as a Chinese customs official, has no right to make this statement. According to Mr. Lida, this matter was decided by the Japanese authorities, and the reason is military necessity. After June 1st, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs will not issue customs export permits to ships sailing to other coasts of China unless the ships obtain permits from the Japanese Navy. The enemy authorities have announced the blockade of 11 Chinese ports, including the ports currently still in Chinese hands. However, it has not been stated whether the ports in South China are included.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 23rd] A Japanese spokesman in Shanghai said that the foreign ships that will be required to obtain Japanese Navy permits in the future will be limited to those exporting from Shanghai, and the Japanese side's exercise of this right is based on the occupation rights of Shanghai.

Blockade to be Implemented on June 1st

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 23rd] Shanghai Jianghai Customs officials refused to formally criticize the declaration issued by the Japanese tax commissioner, but still confirmed that the Japanese Navy's blockade action will be implemented from June 1st. Personnel from the British Embassy have learned that the Japanese Navy's new method is actually intended to be implemented only through one port in China. The British authorities are currently investigating in order to make representations to Tokyo. As far as is known at present, British ships are also among those being restricted. Therefore, before leaving certain designated ports, they must first obtain a permit from the Japanese Navy. It is believed that British ships and ships of other countries will not be able to obtain customs export permits without a permit from the Japanese Navy. Jianghai Customs has agreed to announce the names of the Chinese ports subject to the above-mentioned restrictions within a few days.

### The Enemy's Consulate in Hong Kong Still Denies It

[Foreign News from Hong Kong] Mr. Tajiri, the acting consul general of the enemy in Hong Kong, told a reporter from the Hong Kong China Mail yesterday that the news was strange and that he did not believe that such a declaration had been issued. He said that he had not received any information about such measures even in Hong Kong.

The Hong Kong naval authorities have also not received any news. A British Navy spokesman said, "If the Japanese authorities in Shanghai have issued this order, the Japanese authorities should also send it to the consulates of various countries in Shanghai. However, we have not heard of this matter yet." According to a Chinese customs official here, Mr. Li has no right to issue this announcement on behalf of the Chinese Customs. After this news spread to Hong Kong, the shipping industry here was very surprised, because (1) it would undermine the administrative power of the Chinese Customs, (2) it would violate international law, and (3) it would seize and harm the interests of third countries in China. Although the shipping industry here has not yet obtained detailed information, it is learned that British merchant ships are also among those being restricted, along with other foreign merchant ships. It is heard that the British authorities in China are currently investigating the matter.

### Brief News

Lihua: The members of the western route of the Sichuan-Xikang Inspection Group left Lihua on the 17th to go to Yajiang. The citizens held tea to see them off for more than ten miles in the suburbs. The grand occasion was unseen in thirty years.

### The Commanders of the Four-Nation Fleet Discuss the Gulangyu Incident; The Enemy's Consul in Xiamen Protests to the Local Consulate Corps

[News from Hong Kong] Yesterday (23rd), the Hong Kong China Mail reported, "This (23rd) morning, the naval commanders of the four nations, Britain, the United States, France, and Japan, held a round table meeting on the Japanese army's occupation of the Gulangyu International Settlement on board a battleship. The British representative was Admiral Noble, the commander-in-chief of the China Fleet; the French representative was Admiral Badant, the commander-in-chief of the Asia Fleet; the Japanese representative was Admiral Shiozawa, the commander-in-chief of the South China Fleet; and the American representative was Admiral Stapler, the commander-in-chief of the South China Cruiser Fleet. This meeting was probably of a secret nature, so there were no reports published on its actual situation. As for the soldiers of the four nations, they are still patrolling within the Gulangyu International Settlement." Also, Uchida, the Japanese consul general in Xiamen, protested to the local consular corps (on the 23rd), saying that the landing of the navies of Britain, France, and the United States was an unfriendly move. Given the previous situation of Gulangyu, his request for the three countries to withdraw their troops was reasonable. As for "the Japanese side's request for the Gulangyu Municipal Council to employ Japanese staff, it is also because Japan hopes for the peace and prosperity of the international settlement, similar to the situation in Xiamen." Uchida also drew the attention of the consular corps, saying that the number of Japanese troops landed had been reduced on the 15th of this month. As soon as the investigation of the murder case of Mr. Hong Lidong, the chairman of the former Japanese Commercial Association, is stepped up, Japan is also planning to completely withdraw its landing troops.

### The Guangdong Enemy Buys Over Traitors to Deceive the Villagers

[Special Dispatch from Guilin, This Newspaper, 23rd] The Guangdong enemy is using a policy of appeasement to buy over the ignorant people. The Guangzhou enemy has set up a civil servant and refugee job placement office, recruiting unemployed vagrants and sending them to various townships to establish lower-level township organizations. The big and small traitors in Guangzhou are extremely active in dreaming of establishing a puppet "Republic of China."

[Special Dispatch from Zhongshan, This Newspaper, 23rd] According to visitors from the interior, the South China enemy military authorities have no confidence in military victories, so they ordered all the puppet organizations under their wing to issue a joint declaration, advocating "peace." The declaration is widely circulated in the occupied areas, but the general public is indifferent to it. Also, recent enemy propaganda rarely boasts about war achievements, which shows that the enemy is actually taking a defensive position and unable to make progress.

### Unrest in the Tianjin Concession; The Enemy's Consul Makes New Demands

[Reuters, Peiping, 23rd] According to the Tianjin puppet organization's newspaper, the Japanese military authorities here have made new demands to the Tianjin British Concession Municipal Council, including the British Municipal Council employing Qing and Japanese advisors, and joint searches for terrorists by the British and Japanese police, and the surrender of those arrested to the Japanese authorities. The newspaper also claimed that the Japanese military authorities are plotting three things: (1) ordering the Peiping puppet government to come forward and take over the Tianjin concessions; (2) the Japanese military supervising the administration of the concessions; (3) surrounding the concessions in a big way to first reduce their importance.

### × Plots to Use Religion to Numb People's Hearts; Sends Ronin to Various Places to Carry Out Activities; American Church People Determined to Reject Unanimously

【Central News Agency, This Celebratory 23rd】Shanghai News: In order to intensify its cultural aggression against our country, × previously sent many idle ronin, posing as Christian teachers, attempting to convene a meeting in Shanghai and engage in incitement. Fortunately, their treachery was discovered by the foreign missionaries in China, who unanimously rejected them and refused to associate with them. ×'s plan failed, and they disappeared for a time, not daring to show their faces.

### Strengthening Mobile Strategy, Crossing the Qiantang River Northward, Military Personnel Arrive in Pudong, Command Authority Can Be Unified Afterward

【Special Telegram from Shanghai, This Newspaper, 23rd】Special News from the Pudong Guerrilla Area: The regular troops that our side has been continuously deploying northward from the Qiantang River actually consist of four divisions. The organization and equipment are purely based on the latest wartime organization. Each division has 20,000 to 25,000 people (5,000 to 10,000 more than usual), so the troop strength is 80,000 to 90,000 people. Approximately 30,000 to 40,000 people have entered the Shanghai-Hangzhou line area. Experienced military personnel have been dispatched to various guerrilla areas to convey the intentions of the senior officers to the non-regularly organized mobile units and to unify the command of the regular and non-regular armies in order to enhance the connection. As for the Pudong and Punan guerrilla teams under the command of Ding Xishan, Yu Taosheng, and Zhang Huifang, these military personnel have all arrived, and it has been instructed that future actions should be based on the military orders of the regular army and should not advance or retreat arbitrarily.

### A Sketch of Haifeng

— Xiao Ming

【Continued from yesterday】The hair of women in Haifeng over middle age is just like those scholars on Mount Luofu. It is coiled on the top of the head and adorned with a "hairpin clock" (made of silver or copper, quite like the figures on the sedan chairs, but decorated with many patterns). Women's clothes are mostly simple, but their hard lives are also evident. Haifeng women have a special liking for drinking "salty tea." Every morning around ten o'clock, they mix tea leaves, salt, sesame, and boiling water and drink it. Those with a large appetite can drink more than ten bowls without hesitation. "Raw food" is also a Haifeng people's hobby. "Fresh oysters," "raw shrimp"... are only seasoned with salt before being eaten, which seems to be detrimental to health. The general people's economy is not enough to eat white rice. It is simply an exception. For every meal they use sweet potatoes - sweet potato porridge - to replace white rice three meals a day. The richer ones only eat sweet potatoes with less proportion and white rice with more proportion.

Because education is not popular in Haifeng, the lower and middle classes of people are extremely superstitious. On the birthday of a god or any other day, in temples like "Guanyin Temple," "Confucius Temple," "City God Temple," "Water Immortal Temple," etc., those worshiping and kneeling are all "pious men," not "pious women." The pious men dare to stand up only after they have received a "holy order" and obtained the permission of the Bodhisattva. Many elders still keep the dragon tail at the top of their Qing-dynasty queues.

Because Haifeng is near the sea, fish and salt are its major products. The fishing industry in Shanwei is very famous throughout the country. The local salt is very cheap, and the supply of salt to Shantou, northern Guangdong, and southern Jiangxi is all transported from Shanwei. In addition to the profits from fish and salt, sweet potatoes can be regarded as a major product, because the whole county eats sweet potato rice. There is no family in this place that burns firewood for cooking, they only use charcoal. Even firewood prepared for sale is burned first before being sold.

Three. Haifeng's Smuggling, Gambling, and Spies

The value of smuggled goods imported into Chao-Shan reaches over one million yuan per month. Haifeng accounts for at least tens of thousands of yuan. This is not a lie. Please come and see for yourself. When you go to the more prosperous areas like Shanwei, Jiesheng, Qingge, Gongping, Mei Lung-fu Cheng, etc., you will constantly see rayon fabrics, handbags, rubber shoes, children's toys, and various cosmetics (smuggled goods account for at least 60%) constantly appearing before your eyes. I will publish another article about the import of smuggled goods and smuggling conditions in the eastern Guangdong area. This reality naturally exists in Haifeng as well. As for the gambling atmosphere in Haifeng, it is indeed extremely prevalent. This is partly because there are no other (besides gambling) entertainment options, and partly because the people do not have various handicrafts to do.

There are indeed quite a lot of Haifeng spies after the flames of resistance against the enemy were ignited in South China.

What is most puzzling is that every time Shanwei ships salt to Shantou for transfer to the interior, × planes inevitably come to bomb the salt ships. There are no × warships off the coast of Shanwei, so why do the × people know such accurate information? The anti-espionage movement must be effectively implemented in Haifeng.

### A Record of the Burma Road

— Written by Bishop Walter, Translated by Qian Boming

China and Burma can have great mutual assistance. South Asia and China have many contributions to each other. The newly opened international highway between Yangon and Kunming, and the railway currently under construction between these two cities, will become one of the most important international roads in the world.

Recently, the development of modern industry and modern transportation methods with other countries have made this road a vital artery of China's great west. Half a century ago, visionaries wanted to lay a railway between Yangon and Kunming, but the time was not ripe because the interests of the people and the country were in conflict. Fortunately, these obstacles are now in the past, and there are now modern conveniences for five-way trade between China and Burma, and each benefits from it.

On January 18th, our party set out from Yangon, following the new China-Burma highway to Kunming. Through the cooperation of Mr. Holmes, we obtained two new Dodge trucks weighing three-quarters of a ton as transportation. Our party totaled seven people. One truck carried most of our heavy luggage and two people. The remaining five people rode in another truck with comfortable American seat covers, comfortably making the journey.

On the evening of January 18th, our first army truck left Yangon. The second truck left shortly after noon the next day. The first four hundred and forty miles from Yangon to Mandalay, with good roads parallel to the sea level, we spent a few hours sightseeing in Mandalay, which was quite interesting. This famous city has the pagodas and palaces of the last Burmese dynasty. At that time, we remembered Kipling's poem: "On the road to Mandalay, where the flying fishes play." But we did not see flying fish, because the road we took was faster than the ships on the Irrawaddy River. Although we regarded Kunming as the destination of this trip, I did not recall the experience that could make us feel "a booming like China when it's morning"!

Fifteen or twenty miles out of Mandalay, we began to drive into the mountains, driving through or on top of the mountains towards Pyinmana. From Yangon to Lashio, except for a short stretch of less than twenty miles of highway, the rest of the road surface is very neat. The road out of Yangon also ends in Lashio. Lashio is about one hundred and ten miles from the Chinese border, with a beautiful position, about thirty feet above sea level, surrounded by beautiful mountains and deep valleys. The railway management agency has extended the railway to the outside of the city to facilitate the actions of various groups from the Chinese side. At the connecting point, these groups need to have a warehouse to store goods. The Burmese government is now earnestly and thoroughly taking its part of the responsibility for completing the connection between the China-Burma railway and highway. This is evident in many places. Regarding the attitude of the British, there is no doubt that it is easy to recall that the British Empire must strive to accomplish any undertaking.

This highway is indeed under the management of the Chinese and Burmese governments. In particular, from Mandalay to Lashio and then to Kunming, public traffic is not allowed. From Lashio to Kunming, travelers are inspected before many obstacles. Fortunately, we had reported our plans to the government officials of both countries a long time before departure and when we actually set off, so we received courteous hospitality and cooperation everywhere, and also obtained letters of introduction and passes, which we could use when needed.

On the Chinese side, transportation and travel on the highway must be permitted by the Southwest Transportation Company. In Yangon, Kunming, and important locations between the two cities, we saw well-trained, knowledgeable, and courteous people managing the offices of the Southwest Transportation Company, handling affairs efficiently. Some of our group had traveled extensively in China in previous years and were all delighted with the efficient handling and sincere and courteous hospitality of the personnel responsible for the entire highway.

The old military highway of the Burmese government from Lashio to the border was undoubtedly suitable for initial use, but it is too narrow for the large amount of new traffic, so it is now being rapidly widened.

On both sides of the border live mountain people who are mixed with Chinese, including Burmese mountain people and Chinese mountain people. They seem to be descendants of early immigrants from northern Asia and have their own language and many customs that are completely different from other people. On both sides of the border, they maintain an old-fashioned feudal organization. The first district center in these small areas is in Menglu. If, like us, you set off from Lashio by car in the early morning, you can reach Mengxue on the first night. We drove to about thirty miles from Mengxue and received courteous hospitality at the school established by the local government, and spent the night in the school.

Our next stop was Longling, where the Chinese customs office is located. Here again we saw very capable modern Chinese people managing the offices of the transportation company, immediately handling our affairs and sending us on our way. In order to complete the next leg of the journey, we drove straight into the night, braving the biting cold wind on the very high highway. When we arrived at Xiaguan, the Southwest Transportation Company courteously invited us to stay in the guesthouse, which was a converted temple equipped with various conveniences to facilitate the company's personnel.

The next morning, we saw snow in the valley. Our location was eight thousand feet high, and the valley was about two thousand feet higher. This was the only place we saw snow along the way. We were lucky not to have encountered rain or snow from Yangon to Kunming. Because of the mountainous cliffs, the road workers who built this highway had to laboriously open up the road by hand on the sides and faces of the mountains.

The road surface is often blocked by rocks and mud that are washed down by heavy rains, either by erosion under the road or by mud falling from above. The road is currently very safe in the half-term long dry season, but there may be many difficulties during the rainy season in June. Management personnel are now using thousands of workers to widen dangerous areas, remove more of the soil, and build stone road surfaces on Burmese holes to replace temporary wooden frames, and reduce the degree of slope in some places.

Anyone who passes this new highway will be even more convinced that China will win the final victory in this war. The road itself, which can carry heavy trucks to completion, is of great significance, and the railway, which is now being rapidly built, will run parallel to this highway, foretelling that the great west of China will no longer be as isolated as it used to be.

In these areas, no one feels the density of smoke, but they feel that modern transportation methods will rapidly develop the resources of southern China, both in terms of people and materials.

Since many coastal cities in China have been occupied by the invaders, it is necessary to adjust the supply of salt, which is essential for the lives of the Chinese people. The great west of China has huge salt deposits, one of which is in this southwest region. Tens of thousands of square salt bricks can be seen along the highway, with unique shapes for easy carrying. This kind of salt deposit is obviously taken from places far away from the edge of the ancient lake. If salt deposits are found on the lakeside and fish, vegetables, and other things are deposited together with the salt grains, it contains goiter. I saw a large number of people with goiter on several sections of the new highway, more than I had ever seen before.

This is just one example of the resources that China can obtain after opening up new transportation facilities. From Yangon to the Chinese border and even further, I have seen thousands of oxcarts. The new highway even makes the transportation of these vehicles more effective. Anyone who leaves the oxcart area will be deeply impressed by the shortage of labor in handling various modern products and trade. Therefore, China has purchased thousands of cars to run in the southwest, so it is very interesting to remember the changes that are coming.

This war, like other wars, will end one day. The China-Burma Highway will be even more effective in peacetime than in the current emergency. It seems destined to become one of the world's famous scenic international roads. Driving on this road for a few days, the scenery of Guanghan, the towering mountains, steep cliffs, and secluded valleys, is constantly changing. Because the terrain is much higher than the south, the temperature is cool, the air is fresh, and not too cold. When agencies such as the China Travel Service, Thomas Cook, and American Express comfortably drive tourists around the world through this highway in the future, they will know that it is a profitable business. It is now enough to drive from Lashio to Kunming by car in four days. If time is limited, the journey can be completed in a shorter time. On the other hand, if someone wants to camp or climb mountains and spend two weeks or a month, then this highway will give him the opportunity for the most enjoyable vacation.

The benefits of the China-Burma Highway are not one-sided, but Burma benefits more than China, and China's import and export trade will also greatly benefit the Burmese people.

Although we lingered in Burma for a few days, we have seen how the country has become another battleground in the current war. The Burmese government and its many true politicians and enlightened civil leaders know that their country and China will benefit from this highway and railway in the future. However, those who are using all means to obstruct China's freedom and development are using money to promote misinterpretations to Burmese people whom they believe can be swayed, and illegally misinterpreting the phrase "Asia for Asians." Neutral observers doubt whether this slogan can fool others. As Abraham Lincoln said: "You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time"!

### I Request the League of Nations to Implement Expanded Aid to China and Cease Supplying War Materials to Japan; British Foreign Secretary States Responsibility is Not Forgotten

[Reuters, Geneva, 22nd] Dr. Wellington Koo, Chinese Ambassador to France, delivered a moving speech to the League of Nations Council today, making two requests: First, that member states be notified to expand their financial and material assistance to China to enhance its ability to resist aggression and to aid refugees, to avoid any actions that would weaken China's resistance to aggression, to cease supplying Japan with war tools and raw materials, especially aircraft and oil, to prevent further intensification of its aggression, and to restrict the import of Japanese goods; Second, to form a group to jointly promote the above steps. Ambassador Koo stated that China is willing to exert its utmost strength in manpower and resources to serve as the outpost of the world peace front. If China were to succumb to Japanese threats or cease resisting Japanese aggression and accept Japan's monopoly in the Far East, the impact on the interests of democratic countries in the Far East and on the current tense situation in Europe would be obvious to any discerning person. Ambassador Koo also briefly described the current situation, saying that China's strategy is to avoid positional warfare and adopt mobile tactics to annihilate the invading army concentrating its attacks on fixed targets. They are struggling to grasp the location of the main force of the Chinese army. This strategy has placed the Chinese army in a proactive position, allowing it to launch attacks on the invading army from all sides simultaneously. Ambassador Koo further pointed out that the Japanese army's plot to cut off China's two international transportation arteries has clearly failed. American aircraft companies have unanimously complied with the U.S. government's advice last July to stop selling aircraft to Japan. This determination is truly commendable. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax then spoke, echoing Ambassador Koo's request, saying, "We are deeply moved by the speech of the distinguished representative of China. We are not only uneasy in view of the suffering of the Chinese people, but also admire their unity and courage. For more than two years, the world has witnessed China being oppressed by its neighbor, which brings all of its wealth and all of its modern weapons of war to bear on China. In fact, it would be in Japan's interest to have genuine amity and goodwill towards China. The Chinese people's efforts in resisting the war have gained widespread and profound sympathy, and the British government is among them. However, the reason why the British government feels unable to fully support the broad suggestions made by Dr. Koo just now is not a lack of sympathy, nor can it be said that the British government has abandoned the policy previously decided by the representatives of the League of Nations regarding the Far Eastern war. The British government's desire to sincerely create an opportunity for a fair resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute has remained unchanged, and the responsibility to provide individual assistance to China as much as possible, as decided by the League of Nations on October 6, 1937, is always on our minds. As a member of the League of Nations, Britain has never avoided assuming this sense of duty. Therefore, Britain not only does not want to close the connecting lines between Chinese and British territories, but also opens up new communication routes to facilitate China, and at the same time provides financial assistance to China. There is no need for me to elaborate on the details. The British government hopes, and the Chinese government seems to have acknowledged, that although these measures are sometimes taken with a view to safeguarding Britain's own interests, they also greatly benefit China's current difficulties. In the future, the British government will never dare to forget the needs of the Chinese people and the responsibilities entrusted by the previous resolution of the League of Nations. The Chinese representative's suggestion to establish a subcommittee to pay special attention to the Far East, to consult on joint measures under Article 16 of the Covenant, is also reminiscent of similar suggestions made at previous meetings. At that time, there was unanimous agreement on the principle of this joint action, but at the same time it was found that the basic elements of this joint action were still lacking." At this point, Lord Halifax asked the representatives of various countries whether the situation had changed since the last meeting, and whether they felt that the above-mentioned basic elements had already emerged. He said that he was convinced that all countries with direct relations with China must feel that it was not yet the time. Therefore, it would be insincere for him to expect the British government to assume the new responsibilities indicated in Dr. Koo's suggestion at this time, when Britain still bears significant responsibilities elsewhere in the world. The British government believes that other countries must also feel the same way. For this reason, the British government fears that the establishment of a consultative subcommittee at this time would be unlikely to achieve any results. Mr. Jordan, the New Zealand High Commissioner, expressed absolute support for China's proposal and urged the League of Nations Council to accept Dr. Koo's suggestion. At this point, the meeting was temporarily adjourned so that Soviet Ambassador Maisky could exchange views with other representatives.

[Associated Press, Geneva, 22nd] China has proposed to the League of Nations the organization of a cooperation committee similar to the 52-nation committee that sanctioned Italy's aggression against Abyssinia, but this request does not appear to have any immediate hope of success because Britain and France still need to consider it. China also wants to invoke Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, but Britain and France seem to believe that the European crisis has not been completely resolved, so the solution to the Far Eastern problem still needs to wait.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 22nd] The League of Nations Council held a closed-door meeting this morning. Our representative, Wellington Koo, spoke, urging the Council to discuss China's appeal as soon as possible, and not to wait until the regular session is about to close before discussing it. The representatives immediately agreed unanimously to list China's appeal as the first item on the agenda of this afternoon's open meeting. Regarding the telegram sent by the King of Albania to the League of Nations last week, the representatives of the major countries on the Council intended to avoid discussing it. However, Ambassador Koo and Soviet Ambassador Maisky both dissented. Ambassador Koo stood up and said that China had no direct or indirect interest in Albania, but since Albania was a member state of the League of Nations, this issue involved the principles of the League of Nations Covenant and international law, and the survival of the League of Nations organization was also related to it. It is understood that Ambassador Koo specifically avoided attacking Italy when speaking. The Council generally intends to refer the Albanian issue to the next session of the League of Nations General Assembly. The Council will listen to Ambassador Koo's statement when it meets this afternoon. So far, there has been no further discussion of the China issue. Ambassador Koo will exchange views with the British and French foreign ministers before they leave tomorrow.

### Italian and German Foreign Ministers Deliver Broadcast Speeches; U.S. to Intensify Implementation of Defense Plan Due to German-Italian Military Alliance

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] The signing ceremony of the German-Italian political and military treaty was recently held in the "Ambassador's Hall" of the State Council. Many pots of lilac flowers were placed in the hall. Four German civil servants stood upright in front of the table, each holding a copy of the treaty, totaling four copies, two in Italian and two in German. At exactly 11:00 a.m., German Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop entered the hall simultaneously. Leaders of the military and party departments, as well as civil and military officials, and more than 100 Italian and German diplomats, followed in orderly fashion. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop personally went to the head of state's office to greet Hitler out of the hall. The head of state sat in a chair in the center, and the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy signed the alliance treaty one after another. Hitler looked quite excited and shook hands with Ribbentrop and Ciano with pleasure, and presented Ciano with the Golden Eagle Medal, the highest medal in Germany. At 11:12 a.m., Foreign Minister Ciano immediately delivered a broadcast speech on the radio, saying that the political and military ties between Germany and Italy have been strengthened by the signing of the treaty. The fate of the two sides is as close as lips and teeth, which is well known to the two nations. Both countries are willing to maintain peace, but are also determined to defend their inalienable right to exist. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop then delivered a broadcast speech, saying that Germany and Italy have now become an indivisible group. If the rule-of-law countries feel suspicious and unite with other countries to conclude treaties, attempting to encircle Germany and Italy, it is tantamount to driving down the road to war. This German-Italian alliance treaty is to give a firm answer to this. From now on, no matter what events occur, our two countries will resolutely unite to deal with them. Regarding the union of Germany and Italy, Head of State Hitler has made a clear statement here, willing to conclude a broad political and military promotion treaty with Italy to enhance the relationship between the two countries, and the treaty signed today is its decision.

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The Japanese government has sent a telegram to the German government congratulating the formal signing of the German-Italian military alliance. Hitler and King Emmanuel of Italy, as well as Mussolini, exchanged congratulatory telegrams.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that he had not yet seen the full text of the German-Italian alliance treaty officially published, so he did not want to comment on it. According to well-informed sources, this move was expected in general, so there was no need to comment on it immediately. What the United States is most concerned about is the balance of power in Europe and what impact it will have on the position of the United States in the Americas and the Far East. The direct impact of the conclusion of the alliance between Germany and Italy is to prompt the United States to intensify the implementation of its defense plan. At the same time, the international arms race will inevitably become more intense, but world peace may be maintained through the balance of power distribution.

### British House of Commons Debates Palestine Policy; Colonial Secretary MacDonald States Maintaining Appropriate Interests of Both Races

[Reuters, London, 22nd] Undersecretary Butler denied in the House of Commons today, in response to questions about Palestine, that the government's new policy was grossly unfair to American and Jewish investment in Palestine, and cited the provisions of the White Paper, urging attention to the need to consider foreign interests. Colonial Secretary MacDonald began debating the government's Palestine policy, saying that the government hoped to express this policy under various different circumstances. When the House last debated this matter, it was hoped that the Arabs and Jews, despite their struggles, could still reach an understanding. Today, that hope has been dashed, so the government has automatically decided on a policy on this issue. This policy is bound to have opposition. The Royal Commission of Inquiry went to Palestine in 1937 and believed that the conflict between Arabs and Jews in the area was not a question of who was right and who was wrong, but a question of dispute between the two sides. This is the real situation, and it is a difficult task for the House to judge the demands of both sides in this situation in order to find a fair solution. The situation in Palestine was caused by the disruption of the war. At that time, the great powers of the earth were competing with each other, seeking friends and alliances. The Arabs and Jews are two nations willing to stay in Palestine, and both nations participated in the war. MacDonald continued to express sympathy for the demands of the Jews and reiterated the situation of the Arabs, saying, "Although we can force the Arabs to establish a Jewish national home in Palestine, it is morally wrong. We must abide by our promise to the Jews and maintain faith with the Arabs." Regarding the U.S. government's promise to the Jews, MacDonald stated that Lord Balfour's promise in 1917 was that "the government would make its best efforts to see the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine." MacDonald continued, saying that some people thought that the meaning of this promise might be to change Palestine into a Jewish state. This possibility has not been absolutely abandoned. Lloyd George also made a guarantee during his time as Prime Minister in 1917, but the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate Agreement did not mention "Jewish Home," but only used a less definite expression, recognizing that Jews could live in Palestine and selecting the term "Jewish national home." When the Balfour Declaration was established, its purpose was to give a landless people a land without people. MacDonald hoped that Palestine would be a vast open space where people establishing homes could concentrate on great creative work, but Palestine was not an empty space. In 1918, there were 600,000 Arabs in the area. The British government has long resolutely stated that there should be no one nation in Palestine that is subordinate to another nation. The British government during Balfour's tenure as Foreign Secretary also had the same determination, so there is no need for any misunderstanding from all parties. The establishment of a Jewish home in Palestine is not to oppose the Arabs, but to establish a Jewish state. Regarding the issue of emigration to Palestine, the British government did declare in 1922 that the number of colonists should not exceed the economic and absorption capacity of the area, but the British government can never strictly adhere to this principle at any time or under any circumstances without making any amendments. In 1923, the number of Jews was 80,000, and now it has increased to 450,000. The British government is determined to find a way to ensure that the minority and majority ethnic groups in Palestine receive appropriate benefits. Britain is quite satisfied with signing treaties with Palestine, maintaining land and air forces, using military ports and airfields, discussing military issues, and providing mutual assistance in the event of difficulties. Mr. Williams stood up and proposed an official opposing motion, saying that the government's proposal could not bring peace and prosperous development to Palestine. The White Paper has destroyed the basic principles of the Balfour Declaration. The government's plan is contrary to history and has no moral basis. He also requested the House to refuse to accept the parliamentary obligations read by MacDonald, saying that this would cause the government to lose confidence in the country and the United States.

Cripps Makes a Suggestion

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Sir Stafford Cripps, who attended the Palestine debate in the House of Commons last night, made a suggestion that part of Palestine should be temporarily designated as Jewish territory, and the Jews should be allowed to organize an autonomous government in this area, while the Arabs could form a government in other parts of Palestine. During this period of division, the Arab economic life gradually developed. After ten years, the Arab and Jewish nations gradually approached and had the opportunity to work together. Labor Party members believe that the government's proposal is a surrender to terrorists. The unrest in Palestine is supported by Germany and Italy. Without external propaganda, Arabs and Jews could have lived in harmony. Undersecretary Butler replied on behalf of the government, "The government has expressed to both the Arabs and Jews that some of their demands cannot be realized. We should make the day when the Arab and Jewish nations can cooperate and understand each other arrive as soon as possible. The Arab representatives in London, Palestine, are all statesmen and will be of great benefit to our current difficulties," he said.

### British King and Queen Tour Toronto and Meet the Dionne Quintuplets

[Reuters, Toronto, 22nd] The British King and Queen arrived here today and were warmly welcomed by Ontario Governor Hepburn. The King declared that he was very happy to visit here with the Queen, but was sorry that he could not stay for long. Local communities held a welcome meeting at the City Hall. Thousands of people gathered at the hall to pay tribute to the King and Queen. Afterwards, the King and Queen drove to the State Assembly, where they were warmly welcomed by the crowd and met the famous Dionne quintuplets. The Queen was very happy and gave each child a blue basket dress and kissed them one by one.

### Roosevelt Speech: Will Not Give Up Social and Economic Reforms; Continue Efforts to Help the Lower Classes

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] President Roosevelt delivered a speech today, saying that the U.S. government will never give up any social and economic reforms. The expenditure of the "New Deal" is very appropriate, and the government should continue to work hard to help the lower classes. President Roosevelt expressed dissatisfaction with the "National Debt Week" held by the Republican Party this week, and stated that the tax rates for small and large businesses and consumers must be maintained. President Roosevelt continued, saying that the current situation in the United States is extremely good and very beneficial to promoting production and business.

Short Commentary

### Japan Plans to Control Coastal Shipping Industry

Mr. Rikita, acting deputy commissioner of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, announced to the outside world that from next Thursday (June 1), all foreign ships sailing along the Chinese coast must carry a permit from the Japanese Navy, otherwise they will be arrested by the Japanese Navy.

Rikita is a customs officer and has no right to make such an announcement according to law, so this announcement has no legal effect. However, the consistent behavior of fascist aggressors is to destroy law and order. As long as it is beneficial to fascist aggression and plunder, then all their speculative adventures, destruction, plunder, slaughter, etc., are the laws of their fascist aggressors. Therefore, Rikita dared to say after announcing Japan's intention that "this is a decision made by the Japanese authorities due to military needs"! In other words, Japan's intention is very likely to become a reality;

Japan's control of China's coastal shipping industry certainly has the military significance of intensifying threats to the war zones in our occupied areas, but the main attempt is to further threaten European and American powers, especially to cut off the lifelines of Britain, the United States, and France in the Far East, and to strengthen its plunder and oppression in the occupied areas in order to save the serious misfortune suffered by its war of aggression against China. Even if it is a step back, it can also be used as a condition for the current negotiations on the concession issue, so as to facilitate its seizure of special rights in the concession. Therefore, we can clearly point out that Japan's attempt is a strategy before Britain, the United States, France, and other countries have formed a unified front to sanction the East, and Japan is preparing to comprehensively exclude the powers of Europe and the United States in the Far East!

Therefore, we and the media should mobilize and urge the close attention of European and American powers and friendly people. We should solemnly point out that Japan's intention is indeed likely to quickly become a reality, and Japan's actions not only destroy the Chinese customs administration, but also violate international law, especially the intention to plunder and destroy the rights and interests of European and American powers in the Far East. Britain, the United States, France, and other countries should quickly take effective steps to give appropriate and necessary sanctions and counterattacks! We firmly believe that Japan's behavior cannot withstand the joint handling of the powers of Europe and the United States!

### Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Agree to Conclude a Mutual Assistance Treaty; Turkey and Greece Welcome It; Poland Will Discuss This in Detail

[Reuters, London, 23rd Special Telegram] According to our agency's inquiry, the proposal for a tripartite alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union does not involve the Soviet Union's Far Eastern border issue, because the scope of the alliance agreement is limited to Europe. Britain has sought the opinions of Eastern European countries on this matter and is still waiting for a reply. It is generally believed that Turkey will definitely welcome it. The relationship between Greece and Turkey is quite close and can also agree. The Polish Ambassador to Britain flew back to Warsaw from London today. It is said that this trip is to take care of personal matters, but after arriving in Warsaw, he will definitely consult with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck in detail, which is undoubted.

[London, 22nd] Foreign news, London newspapers are publishing the news of the establishment of an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union in prominent positions. It is said that the full text of the agreement will be announced after the cabinet meeting on Wednesday. The newspapers are speculating on the content of the agreement, but the unanimous opinion is that this agreement was originally proposed by the Soviet Union and modified by the British counterproposal. General public opinion almost unanimously believes that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have agreed to conclude a tripartite mutual assistance treaty. According to the treaty, if any one country is invaded, the other two countries should provide assistance. It is said that the content of the tripartite agreement includes the Soviet Union's East Asian border, that is, guaranteeing to assist the Soviet Union in resisting Japanese invasion. In addition to mutual assistance, the Soviet Union has also agreed to participate in guaranteeing the sovereignty of Poland and Romania, and will not temporarily provide guarantees to the Baltic countries. It is said that Turkey will also immediately join the alliance and become a four-nation alliance.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 22nd] After French Foreign Minister Bonnet held talks with Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky and British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax separately, well-informed sources immediately declared that all the difficulties in the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union on the organization of an anti-aggression group have been resolved, and there is no longer any danger of failure in the current negotiations. The British Cabinet will hold a cabinet meeting on the 24th of this month to decide on the conclusion of a joint defense agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. According to reports, during the talks between Ambassador Maisky and Foreign Minister Bonnet, the difficulties in establishing an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union were carefully explained. Foreign Minister Bonnet was very satisfied after hearing this, and then held talks with Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, and agreed that the points of consultation between Britain and the Soviet Union have now been completely eliminated. In addition, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax also deeply knows the reasons why Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should immediately establish a joint defense agreement.

[London, 23rd] Foreign news, the Danzig incident has apparently calmed down. The press and political circles here are now paying attention to tomorrow's cabinet meeting. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax returned here from Geneva tonight, carrying the results of the negotiations with Soviet Ambassador Maisky and French Foreign Minister Bonnet. According to press reports, Lord Halifax will visit Chamberlain tonight and submit the details of the Geneva negotiations to tomorrow's cabinet meeting.

### Maisky

— Dong Ping

Maisky, the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, is now a celebrity. However, if it hadn't been for a scrap of paper that saved his life twenty-seven years ago, the world would never have seen this short, stout diplomat again.

Maisky is the son of a Jewish doctor, whose real name is Ivan Lyakhovetsky; he was born in Siberia and educated in Omsk. During the Tsarist era, he was an active young journalist.

He gradually became interested in politics, but unfortunately, he chose the wrong party. He joined the Social Democratic Party, which opposed Lenin's radical revolutionary ideas.

When the Bolshevik Revolution failed in 1905, Maisky took the opportunity to vehemently denounce the futility of terrorism.

In 1912, his fiery articles aroused the hatred of the Bolsheviks. His life was immediately threatened, and he had to plan his escape to England.

Before leaving Russia, he met with his only influential friend, Churchill, who was then a key official in the Tsarist Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow.

As he said goodbye to Churchill, Churchill gave him a letter, telling him to always carry it with him. Maisky didn't pay much attention and casually stuffed it into his pocket, later forgetting about it.

At that time, Bolshevik secret agents were closely following him. However, he was lucky enough to cross the border. In the summer of 1912, he arrived in Newhaven.

At the Newhaven customs, Maisky encountered misfortune again. Because he didn't understand English, the customs officials found an interpreter to tell him that, according to British regulations, foreigners must have five pounds in cash to enter the country.

So, Maisky had to take out his money. He slowly, as if deliberately delaying, put the money on the table. Finally, he shook his hand, indicating that this was all he had. The customs officer came over to count the money, once, twice, three times, and there was no mistake. He told Maisky that he only had three pounds, two shillings, and sixpence, short of one pound, seventeen shillings, and sixpence.

This was terrible. If he didn't have enough money, Maisky would be forced to return to Russia, where those hunting him were waiting.

Maisky wanted to salvage this tragic fate and searched his body frantically, hoping to find some unexpected wealth.

In the end, he still didn't find any money. However, he pulled out a scrap of paper from his pocket. It was the letter that Churchill had given him months ago.

This letter saved his life, because it was officially certified by the Russian government that Maisky was a fugitive forced to flee for political reasons.

Immediately, the customs changed their attitude towards him and allowed him to enter the country, because Britain has always allowed fugitives to enter without restrictions.

For the next five years, Maisky resided in England, publishing articles in several Russian émigré newspapers to make a living.

When the Russian Revolution of 1917 came, Maisky believed that his party, or the Mensheviks, would eventually succeed. Then, he could return to his country.

However, the Bolsheviks succeeded again, and he had to flee again. This time, he fled to his birthplace, Siberia.

There, Maisky devoted himself to writing, penning several books on politics and economics. Later, these books were seen by people in the Soviet government, who felt it was a waste not to use Maisky.

In 1920, they reconciled, and Maisky joined the Soviet Foreign Ministry. In 1922, he became the director of the Foreign Ministry's intelligence department, at which time he married an English woman named Skeabin.

In 1932, he was sent as ambassador to the United Kingdom, bringing his wife with him. He established an extremely sophisticated embassy in Kensington Palace Gardens.

Although Maisky used to be a poor scholar, his extravagance is now well-known in London. The recent banquet he held at the embassy for guests was a rare sight in British social circles in recent years.

Maisky is 55 years old this year, short and stout, with eternally rosy cheeks. At a glance, one can tell that he is a person who lives very comfortably.

Now, Maisky is negotiating with Britain and France in Geneva. After Litvinov's departure, Maisky is the most suitable person to represent the Soviet Union in diplomatic relations with Britain and France.

### Germany and Japan Purchase Large Quantities of Rice from Annam and Siam; Hong Kong Rice Market Stable and Unaffected; Hong Kong and Kowloon Have Hundreds of Thousands of Bags of Rice in Stock, Enough to Last Six Months

According to news from reporters yesterday, Germany and Japan have recently been actively stockpiling grain to prepare for war, purchasing and storing large quantities of rice from the rice-producing countries of Annam and Siam. Special inquiries were made to rice industry giants in Hong Kong about the situation and its impact on Hong Kong. They said that Siam is one of the world's three major rice markets, relying on exports to supply food to areas with shortages throughout the Far East. The largest sales are in Hong Kong and transshipped to the mainland. However, after the fall of Guangzhou, the market for Siamese rice in Hong Kong became sluggish, but this sluggishness quickly revived. The main reason is that the two aggressor nations in Europe and the Far East, Germany and Japan, have been actively stockpiling rice, separately purchasing large quantities of rice from Annam and Siam, thus revitalizing the Annam and Siam rice markets. In the past, Germany purchased significant quantities of brown rice and white rice from Annam and Siam every year, but this year has been particularly increased. According to reliable estimates from Hong Kong rice merchants, as of this month, Germany has purchased approximately more than 20,000 tons of brown rice from Siam and the same quantity of white rice from Annam. These numbers account for almost half of the total rice exports from Annam and Siam. Japan, in the past, directly purchased broken rice from Siam through government-organized companies. This practice was discontinued two or three years ago, but in recent months, they have again been purchasing large quantities from Siam, totaling about 300,000 to 400,000 bags, with a portion being shipped back to Japan for supply and a portion being shipped to North China. Japan has experienced a shortage of staple foods after a long period of war and must purchase large quantities from Siam for supply. Siam produces approximately 1.6 million tons of rice each year. After the war in South China, shipments to various places exploded, with Malaya being the most. However, after Germany and Japan competed to purchase, the situation changed again. In the current situation, Siamese rice occupies the most active position in the German and Japanese markets. However, this situation has no impact on the Hong Kong rice market. According to the rice merchants, Hong Kong is close to Annam and Siam, enjoying transportation convenience. Even if Europe purchases large quantities, it will not affect Hong Kong's rice supply. At present, Hong Kong's rice stocks are extremely abundant, totaling about hundreds of thousands of bags. Based on the current population, the daily demand for white rice is about 6,000 bags. According to Hong Kong's rice stocks, even if supply is stopped for six months, it will be sufficient to maintain. The price of rice in Hong Kong has remained stable in recent days, without major changes.

### Health Bureau Announces Strict Prohibition of Indiscriminate Dumping of Sewage; Meeting Held Yesterday Afternoon; Construction of Public Toilets Approved

The Municipal Health Bureau held a meeting at 4:15 PM yesterday. Attendees included Todd, Medical Officer Stu, Yongjue, Secretary for Chinese Affairs Currie, Police Commissioner Barton, Director of Marine Howard, Councilors Basto, Agori, Chow Sien, Tam A-Shi, Wong Bing-Yao, Tang Shiu-Kin and Shen Jianru. After the meeting, Chairman Todd first read the government's official letter regarding the appointment of Shen Jian as a member of the Municipal Health Bureau to replace Berlin Mei, who is temporarily leaving Hong Kong. Subsequently, the Chairman proposed the following motion for approval: "The members of this Bureau have visited the site of the planned construction of public toilets on Mo Lo Ha Street and studied the objections raised by the Central Theatre business. The unanimous opinion is that the reasons are not sufficient. This Bureau decides to maintain the resolution of the Bureau's conference on November 8, 1938. The resolution is listed in the Bureau Secretary's official document to the Auxiliary Secretary on November 9, 1938." It was passed without dissent. Councilor Wong Bing-Yao raised the following questions regarding the disposal of night soil: (A) Has the Chairman noticed that the disposal of night soil, in addition to following the prescribed methods, is sometimes dumped into open drains and flushed down the channels? (B) Will the Chairman take steps to investigate such incidents and prevent their recurrence? The Chairman replied that the Cleansing Bureau was already aware of the dumping of night soil into drains instead of transferring it to fecal barges. This behavior violates Section 4 of the Minor Offenses Ordinance and Section 8 of the Cleansing Bylaws. The authorities have taken all possible steps to prevent such behavior. Employees of the Cleansing Bureau, from inspectors to street cleaners, have the authority to arrest and prosecute anyone found dumping night soil. The police, of course, have the same authority. Such offenses often occur at night, making investigation difficult. Upon receiving any report of night soil dumping, the authorities immediately order inspectors or foremen to monitor. Arresting offenders has been effective. In the past year, 69 people have been arrested for dumping night soil. Offenders are sentenced to imprisonment or fines by the court. Most of the offenders are night soil carriers.

The results of the discussion on various license applications are as follows: (A) Application for a food establishment license at No. 18 Chun Yuen Street, Ground Floor: Resolved to reject. (B) Application for a food establishment license at No. 5 D'Aguilar Street: Resolved to reject. (C) Application for a food establishment license at No. 42A Stanley Main Street, Ground Floor and Second Floor: Resolved to reject. (D) Application for a food establishment license at No. 157 Connaught Road Central, Ground Floor: Resolved to reject. (E) Application for a seasoning powder factory license at Lot No. 753, Cheung Sha Po, Kowloon City: Resolved to decide after review. (F) Application for a food factory license at No. 238 Queen's Road Central, Second Floor: Resolved to reject. (G) Application for a food manufacturing factory license at No. 44 Bonham Strand, Ground Floor: Resolved to approve. Various health reports are omitted for brevity.

### Shanghai Refugee Students to Go to Guilin Today; Transfer to Work at the Front Line

### Young Woman Driven Mad by Missing Husband; Causes Uproar at Wireless Telegraph Office; Sings and Dances, Calling Herself an Imperial Consort; Taken to Hospital After Police Intervention

At 9:30 AM yesterday, a young woman with short hair, wearing a floral shirt and black pants, suddenly broke into the Central Government Wireless Telegraph Office in Central, singing songs and dancing, calling herself the Heavenly Jade Emperor's Imperial Consort and demanding to file a complaint against her younger uncle. She then proceeded to disrupt the equipment in the telegraph machine room. Employees of the office gathered to stop her and tried to drive her out, but the woman was as strong as an ox and could not be removed. They were forced to sound the alarm. A Chinese officer who was passing by gathered staff to escort the woman back to the Central Police Station to notify her family, and then sent her to the asylum for treatment. It is reported that the madwoman's name is Ho Yip-fong, 30 years old, and she lives with her mother and child on Yik Yam Street in Sham Shui Po. Her husband, Lau Leung, was a hair stylist at a beauty salon. Due to the heavy burden of family expenses, he went to Penang, Singapore, in April last year to seek employment. However, a few months after Lau's departure, Ho became overly sentimental and her nerves were severely stimulated. At the end of last year, madness suddenly broke out, singing, dancing, crying, and laughing erratically. Her family, suffering from this, wanted to send her to the hospital for treatment, but were constrained by economic difficulties and could do nothing.

### The Prelude to Universal Education and Elimination of Illiteracy: New Writing Lesson One

— Qi Zhuo

Opening Ceremony of the New Writing Training Class. Zhang Yilin.

"New Writing Registration Closed!"

The day after the New Writing Society announced the recruitment of students for the "New Writing Teacher Training Class," this sign of "Latecomers Excused" was put up. From this, we can see the strong interest of the general public in the new writing, and even more so the eagerness of young people for knowledge.

The day before yesterday evening, they began their first lesson.

The address was borrowed from Wan Chai Chi Chung School. A classroom that was not very large was filled with 60 students, plus another ten or twenty auditors. All were energetic young men and women.

The opening ceremony began by inviting Mr. Zhang Yilin, the nationally renowned "Old Son Army" from Suzhou and current senator, to give a speech. Mr. Zhang's beard and hair were snow-white, but his spirit was still very strong, and his thinking retained his youthfulness.

The old man inevitably started with "In the old days." Mr. Zhang gave a historical account of the Chinese language movement in the past. He detailed everything from the phonetic symbols of the late Qing Dynasty thirty years ago, to Mr. Cai Yuanpei's Pronunciation Unification Conference in the first year of the Republic of China, to Mr. Wu Zhihui's National Pronunciation Dictionary in the seventh year of the Republic, to the efforts of a former ambassador to Japan to promote the new writing, to the effects of the church using the Roman alphabet to teach local dialects in order to promote the Bible... He spoke in great detail, as if recalling family treasures. The conclusion was that the new writing was a necessary result of historical evolution, the most progressive writing, and the best tool for eliminating illiteracy. Therefore, he earnestly encouraged the students to study with a beginning and an end, and for everyone to be a pioneer in popular education.

Mr. Zhang became more and more excited as he spoke, and added many moving extrapolations.

In his article "My View of Mandarin," Mr. Zhang once said that illiteracy is like a stomachache, which must be relieved quickly. The effect of using phonetic symbols is like riding a rickshaw, while using the new writing is like flying in an airplane. In the Soviet Union, the illiteracy rate used to be over 90 percent. Since the popularization of education using the new writing, it has dropped sharply, and the literacy rate is now over 90 percent. The new writing is also closely related to political clarity. The corruption of officials often takes advantage of the people's illiteracy and lack of knowledge. Promoting the new writing to improve the people's cultural level is also a fundamental task for resisting the war and building the country, and it is a great help to the government in promoting new policies. He hoped that it could be done well in Hong Kong and serve as a model for the whole country. Finally, Mr. Zhang expressed his admiration for Mr. Wang Junheng, Zhou Huasong, Sun Yuan, Wu Dali, Wo Dan, Chen Xin, Chen Zhaoqiu, Cao Linsheng, and Feng Yufang for their financial and material support in organizing the "New Writing Training Class."

Mr. Wang Junheng translated Mr. Zhang's Suzhou Mandarin into Cantonese. Everyone was very interested in the "new type of Cantonese" that this language expert had learned in a very short time, and the reporter was also very impressed by his talent and courage in speaking.

Next, Mr. Feng Yufang, a design committee member of the Military Affairs Commission's Political Department, gave a speech. He had studied abroad for more than ten years and believed that the biggest change was in writing. Kemal's success in creating a new Turkey was largely due to improving the writing system.

As for the greatest writing reform movement, it was undoubtedly the Soviet Union. To this day, the Soviet Union has 128 new writing systems, and 11 dialects can be spoken and 11 writing systems can be written in the Congress. This is a sign of the progress of the new writing and national equality. Looking back at our country, if we take Beijing Mandarin as the standard, the vast majority of the working masses simply do not have the time and energy to learn it. According to general statistics, it takes 5,000 hours to learn Chinese characters to the point of being able to read newspapers and write letters. If you study for five hours a day, it will take three years. Farmers and workers are busy with labor, and at most they can spare one hour a day to study. By the time they get to the coffin, they still won't understand - this is a real fact! This caused everyone to burst into laughter.

What about using the new writing? According to Shanghai's experience, the dumbest illiterate person can read newspapers and write letters in 150 hours. The smart ones can master it in just 80 hours. As for those who have been educated, it only takes a dozen hours to master it.

We are not against Chinese characters, but as times change, China will have two writing systems. The rich can have time to learn Chinese characters, and the poor masses must have the tool of writing to read newspapers, write letters, and study various subjects. The new writing is indispensable. Without the new writing, the working masses will always be cut off from knowledge.

Even English must be improved. How many of our Chinese students, from junior high school to high school to university graduation, after spending ten years on English, can be fluent in it?

Foreigners have also felt this way and are already working to improve English. Because the standard of good writing is whether or not it can use writing symbols in the shortest amount of time as a tool for expression. According to the sales of Hong Kong newspapers, it can be seen that 95 out of 100 people do not read newspapers. This is the greatest shame, and we must quickly use the new writing to remedy it.

Next, Mr. Chen Xin gave a speech, and then classes officially began. The first lesson was taught by Mr. Wang Junheng on "Theory," and the second lesson was taught by Mr. Wu Dali on "Reader." This opening lesson ended happily at 9:30 PM. Each student spent only three copper coins to buy textbooks, and there were no other expenses. The class schedule is Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. The courses include theory, reader, writing, current affairs forum, selected readings, composition, teaching methods, translation, singing, and other subjects. After graduating in six weeks, those with excellent grades will be selected and sent to various places to promote the new writing, and the association will subsidize each person with HK$20 per month. We sincerely extend our best wishes for the launch of this great movement!

### Health Bureau Prohibits Pig Farming in Kowloon; Villagers Request Reconsideration; Livelihood of Hundreds of Years, Relocation is Impossible; Huang Yangyou and Others Elected to Take Charge of Making Appeals

The Municipal Health Bureau is enforcing the order prohibiting pig farming by residents of Kowloon. Since receiving the Health Bureau's reply refusing to delay the date, the pig farming villagers of Kowloon have gathered for three consecutive days from the 21st to the 23rd, represented by various village gentry, to discuss and report the Chairman's reply and discuss solutions. The village gentry all believe that at a time when the government is desperately seeking food self-sufficiency, abruptly enforcing the ban is ××××. Moreover, tens of thousands of peninsula villagers who have relied on pig farming and planting for their livelihoods for hundreds of years have no other means of earning a living. If pig farming is banned, the planting of vegetables will also be unable to continue. Their future lives will become a real problem. Therefore, they have to continue to appeal to the authorities to revoke the ban so that tens of thousands of villagers can continue their livelihoods. Huang Yangyou and twelve others were immediately elected to take charge of making appeals.

### We Closely Surround Huicheng: Carrying Out a Large-Scale Annihilation Battle, Our Troops Fiercely Struggle in the Suburbs of Jiangmen, We Block the Gongyi Waterway So that Enemy Boats Cannot Move

[Zhongshan Express News] In the Jiang (men) Hui (cheng) battle, our troops have been holding on fiercely for two days. The sounds of artillery fire have been heard continuously in the Zhongshan county area and between Gongyi. However, our soldiers are performing their duties bravely, advancing through the rain of bullets and bathing in blood, and pressing the enemy troops. On the 22nd, the enemy in Jiang and Hui felt that they could not take care of both ends and were on the verge of collapse. The military situation is as follows:

Closely Surrounding Huicheng

The army, advancing along Xinkai Road, successively recovered Dayun Mountain, Fenshui River, Daxiaomeihou, and continued to occupy Jinniu Mountain River Dike, once rushed into Huiminmen of Huicheng. Dozens of enemy troops, considering the objectives having been reached and fearing that the isolated troops would easily be taken advantage of by the enemy, then withdrew on their own initiative, closely guarding the four suburbs, and closely monitoring the enemy. On the 21st and 22nd, the enemy troops entrenched in the city stubbornly defended the city, bombarding our positions with steel cannons and machine guns, hoping to defend to the death. Our army also fiercely attacked the enemy with new-style field artillery. A fierce artillery battle took place for two days. Our army used positional warfare tactics and exerted its maximum power, always maintaining favorable positions.

Fierce Battle in the Suburbs of Jiangmen

Regarding the counterattack on Jiangmen along the Jiang, Fo, Xin, and He roads, our army is making good progress. Fierce battles are now taking place with the enemy in the Danzao Wucun area in the suburbs of Jiangmen. More than 100 enemies have been wiped out successively. It is reported that a part of our assault team is advancing towards Beijie to coordinate the attack on the urban area from the Jiangfo Road. Now our large army is still continuously opening up the front line, preparing for a large-scale annihilation battle. For the past two days, the sounds of fierce artillery fire between our troops and the enemy have been heard in Zhongshan County, which shows the intensity of the battle in the suburbs of Jiangmen.

Complete Waterway Blockade

In addition, our military authorities, in order to prevent the Jianghui enemy troops from trying to contain our army's advance, often use motorboats to harass our Gongyi Danshuikou and other places along the waterway. In order to combat this enemy's conspiracy, the Gongyi waterway is being blocked. The first phase of the project was completed last week, and the second phase of the project has now been completed. There are also some water mines deployed in the enemy area to prevent the enemy's motorboats from moving, so as to avoid worries, and to be able to concentrate on attacking Huicheng.

### The Enemy Invades Dongbao: Repelled Separately by Our Troops, Freight Transportation is Smooth Below Changping on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, The Coast of Baoan is Peaceful and There are No Enemy Traces in the Territory

(Shenzhen Express News) On the south bank of the East River, our army team has been adopting a steady and solid strategy to advance towards the enemy in Wancheng, Shilong, and Taiping. Giving the enemy creation, the enemy tried to contain our counter-offensive progress and frequently harassed various places. The enemy who invaded Dong (guan) Ze (an) on the 21st and 22nd has now been repelled separately by our team. According to a telephone call from the front, the enemy who came from Shilong and Wancheng on the morning of the 21st totaled more than 300 people, including dozens of cavalry and six or seven steel cannons, coming fiercely. However, it was found that the enemy army was determined to harass and contain, and after being intercepted by our team, they retreated immediately. Our team immediately tracked down and searched, and the entire enemy army was wiped out in the afternoon. At that time, on the railway side, our team pursued the defeated enemy who had fled to Shilong, and chased them to Jingshan, inflicting heavy blows and annihilating dozens more enemy troops. There are now no traces of the enemy in Huangli, Dongjing, Jingshan and other places. Traffic is normal below Changping on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and freight transportation is also smooth. As for the enemy in Xinqiao, Wu Xia, and Huangsonggang who invaded Baoan on the morning of the 22nd, after looting wildly in Huangsong in the afternoon, they continued to loot food and property from the village of Fuyong. At that time, the villagers in the nearby area fled to Xixiang Gushu. The enemy then pursued with cavalry, snatching dozens of dan of food and rice in Quxiang, and then withdrew towards Taiping along Baotai Road. It was found that the enemy had forced the villagers to accept the Taiping puppet organization's orders, submit military pay on a monthly basis, and conscript some young men, kill three villagers surnamed Wen, and rob villagers of a large amount of food and property. Now the entire territory of Baoan has no traces of the enemy on the 23rd, and the coastal area is also peaceful as usual.

It was also found that the commanders of the Taiping enemy army had brazenly demanded that Liang Baoren, the magistrate of Baoan County, hand over political power, otherwise they would decide to send a large army to invade in the shortest possible time in an attempt to intimidate. The people of the county have become accustomed to hearing such dangerous tricks from the enemy army, and have mostly ignored them, so people's hearts are calm as usual. In order to crush the enemy's conspiracy, Liang Baoren and Li Ruibai, the fourth and fifth major captains of the fourth district guerrilla column, have ordered their subordinates to maintain strict vigilance in Foziao, Xixiang, Gushu, Nantou and other places. If the enemy comes to invade, they will die.

### Guangzhou Enemy Troops Humiliate Citizens

(Shaoguan Express News) The enemy who occupied Guangzhou has recently lost at the front line and has angered the citizens.

The citizens have suffered all kinds of harsh treatment, and the whole city has become a world of terror and desolation.

Those who are eligible to apply are male youths who have graduated from senior high school or junior high school or have equivalent qualifications and are between the ages of 20 and 25.

### Crushing the Enemy's Policy of Appeasement

[Shaoguan Special Training] The enemy troops in the guerrilla area often transfer the property obtained from robbing Village A to Village B, and transfer the property from robbing Village C to Village D, in order to carry out their deceptive and poisonous policy of appeasement. Our people are extremely angry about this. The women who were lured back to their hometowns have fled again, and the young men have joined the regular army and guerrillas to kill the enemy. Now the provincial government is stepping up its efforts to promote politics in the war zone and disintegrate the enemy's traitorous conspiracy.

### Two Youths from Lingshan Voluntarily Enlist to Kill the Enemy

(Lingshan Communication) Nan Ke Village, Tuxiang Township, County, has two youths, Shi and Xiang Yu, who have recently been invaded by the enemy and are shocked by the meaning of the country's destruction and family destruction.

### Statistics on the Number of Bombs Dropped by Enemy Aircraft in Northern Guangdong Since the War of Resistance: A Blood Debt That Needs to be Cleared Urgently

(Qujiang Express News) Since the Lugouqiao Incident broke out, our full-scale war of resistance will be two years old. Since the 22nd month, the enemy aircraft has been wantonly wreaking havoc on our non-military areas where there are no resisting people. In various parts of northern Guangdong, enemy aircraft dropped no less than 10,000 bombs, destroying thousands of houses and killing and wounding more than 1,300 people.

### The Fourth War Zone Announces That the Destruction of Highways Must Be Thorough so That the Enemy Cannot Use Our Transportation Lines

(Qujiang Express News) Deng Longguang, the commander of the 64th Army, reported that the enemy recently invaded Heshan from Xinhui and advanced along the Xinhe Highway. Although the road was destroyed before the war, whenever the enemy encountered a gap, they would tie straw together into bundles to fill it, then add soil, and set up wooden boards on it for vehicles to pass through. According to this, Zhang Dai, the acting commander of the Fourth War Zone, quoted the instructions given by the chairman of the committee on the last item of the regulations on the method of destroying highways, saying that if there is ample time, the entire roadbed should be removed so that the enemy cannot use our inherent transportation lines as combat routes. Zhang specially ordered his subordinates to transfer the order to various commissioners and county magistrates, saying that the destruction of highways must be examined at any time and place, and the depth of the destruction of the roadbed should be increased as much as possible. Attention should also be paid to digging out the soil and placing it far away or in the river so that it is difficult for the enemy to use. Then, no matter what method the enemy uses, they will be hindered by this major destruction, and it will be difficult for them to reach it quickly. It is also reported that the highway destruction inspection team organized by the provincial government has also been ordered to step up its work to ensure that the destruction of each highway meets the standards.

[Kaiping Express News] Li Xipeng, the magistrate of Kaiping County, was recently ordered to continue to thoroughly destroy the highway to prevent enemy cavalry from invading. In recent days, he has summoned the township chiefs to discuss everything and ordered each township chief to immediately start construction to destroy the highway, so as to emphasize military affairs. It was found that the third district of the county had not thoroughly destroyed the highway, so County Magistrate Li sent a team to urge the construction to start on the same day, and those who violated the order would be severely punished.

### The Fanconghua Guerrilla Team is Active: The Enemy Army Invaded Huangqishan Twice, Using Aircraft to Cover the Attack But Failed

(Huaxian Express News) Wu Guanhong, the commander of the Second Guerrilla Column, has recently sent troops deep into the enemy's rear to launch extensive guerrilla warfare in the Fanconghua area, repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. Recently, each team was ordered to attack, and Wu's troops mostly operated in the Xinji Fengyong area, coordinating with the national army to fight, and achieving major results. Especially in the two battles of Huangqishan, the enemy was annihilated in large numbers. It was found that yesterday, the enemy attacked Huangqishan with more than 100 infantrymen and 30 to 40 cavalrymen. The first and second battalions of the fourth detachment of Wu's troops were guarding the north of the mountain. Because they occupied the superior position on the top of the mountain, the enemy could not advance. After a fierce battle, the enemy's situation gradually became unsustainable and was surrounded by our troops. At 3:00 PM, the enemy reinforcements from Yubantan arrived, opening up more than 100 infantry and artillerymen, attaching many steel cannons, and firing at the mountain. After that, they rushed in with two squads of troops, but were also wiped out, with only one person surviving. After a mutual battle until 7:00 PM, the enemy retreated towards Xinjie before returning to their original defense. It is estimated that the enemy suffered more than 40 casualties, and the team also suffered the injury of two company commanders, Zhou Chaojin and Chen Dazhu, and 862 houses were damaged. Yingshan dropped 3 dead soldiers. In the second attack, the enemy attacked the defense area of the fifth detachment with more than 100 infantrymen, 20 to 30 cavalrymen, and multiple fixed cannons, and used multiple aircraft to cover and threaten from the sky. After a mutual battle for about two hours, the team retreated to Yazongling to avoid major sacrifices. The enemy did not know the truth of our side, and soon also retreated towards Xinjie. Now Wu's troops are still active in the Qiconghua area, waiting for the opportunity to attack the enemy.

### The Enemy Disturbs Xinhui: Villagers Flee One After Another

(Zhongshan Express News) After Jiangmen Huicheng fell, the enemy in the nearby villages engaged in xxxx, doing everything. The villagers in the 5th, 7th, and 10th districts along the Jiangfo Road resent the enemy's intrusion at any time, and the bandits and local bandits have taken the opportunity to loot everywhere. Ten rooms are nine empty. It is now found that the people in Shitou, Shuangshe, Fengshe, Yishan, Nanshan, Tangxia, Xinmiao, Tongjing, Dayao, Mulang, Zhoujun, Huangzhuang, Gubomiao, Xinshi and other places are not living well, and some have become starving people, which is unspeakable. There are more than ten bandit dens between the villages and Houtang Overseas. Due to living conditions, the people in the inland would rather die trapped in the countryside than flee to Hong Kong, Macao, and other counties to try to struggle again. Therefore, the villagers near Tangxia Huangzhuang have fled one after another, passing through Zhoujun Customs and crossing Houtang to Xiaohang in Zhongshan, led by the so-called "patrolling horse", charging each person a river yuan (including protection fees and water feet), so each "patrolling horse" has made a lot of profit.

### Men Should Be Ashamed: A Young Woman Kills the Enemy

(Nanhai Express News) The people in the Foshan urban area have been repeatedly ravaged and destroyed by the enemy army, and everyone is heartbroken. On the 18th of this month, a couple, Zhao Shanbao and his wife, were passing through Pujun Market when they happened to meet two enemy soldiers. Zhao was arrested and driven into a vacant shop, hoping to xxxx. Zhao's wife, Chen Bixie, was the daughter of a certain technician and was skilled in fighting. At the critical moment, she took the opportunity to kick an enemy soldier and knock him down, seized the bayonet on the enemy's body, and stabbed him to death with her hand. The remaining one was also knocked down by Dong and fled out the door. The matter was discovered by the fake police, who reported that the enemy army had sent 30 to 40 military police to arrive, cut off traffic, and searched the area, and arrested one innocent man and woman suspected of being sent to the enemy headquarters for joint trial.

Movies and Theater

### "One Year" Staged in Chongqing

— Xue Ying

Hong Kong will also stage the play, both to raise funds for the Salvation Daily

(Chongqing Correspondence) "One Year" is a four-act play newly written by Xia Yan. This play was written for Jin Shan, Wang Ying, and others to go abroad to raise funds for the Fifth Group Army's wounded soldier factories, etc. Mr. Xia Yan presides over the Salvation Daily and is already very busy, but because this matter is of great importance, and Jin Shan and others were worried about not having a new play to perform, they repeatedly urged and prompted him, so he rushed to write it in his spare time.

Although the play was rushed out in his spare time, "One Year" is still unanimously recognized as an outstanding new realistic drama. The war does not have a single formulaic salvation face, but it is overflowing with a strong atmosphere of confidence and optimism about the victory of the war of resistance. The clear depiction of the characters and the clever and powerful ending are major reasons why this play has become a masterpiece. It is expected that when this play is performed in the United States, it will make the American people more aware of China's strength and indomitable spirit, which will be no problem.

It is said that in addition to Jin Shan, Wang Ying, and others performing in the United States, the play was recently performed at the Guotai Grand Theater in Chongqing. With a grand lineup, the business was extremely good. The asking price for honorary seats was fifty yuan per pair, but the result was still a full house, even the glass was crushed. Wang Pusheng, who managed the front desk, wore his lieutenant colonel uniform, but still could not maintain order in an orderly manner.

This public performance was to raise funds for the Salvation Daily, and the surplus after settlement was more than seven thousand yuan. The cast was very strong. The director was Ying Yunxiao, and the actors included Zhao Dan, who played the strong and righteous old man Liu Ailu, Bai Yang, who played the bride, Shu Xiuwen, who played the aunt Xiu Sheng, Wang Weiyi, who played the defeatist Ming Yang, and Ying Yin, who played Yu Zhihua, a salvation member living in a pavilion room. Other roles, such as De Fang and A Shu, were also the best choices at the time. This can be seen from the fact that Bai Yang only played a bride with few scenes. As for the background of the play, the first two acts take place at a small station along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, and the third and fourth acts take place in Shanghai after the fall.

[Note] In addition to Chongqing, recent news has been received that someone in Hong Kong is preparing to stage it.

### ×Film Crew Goes to Hangzhou to Film, Arrived in Shanghai on Monday

The personnel who came to China from Tokyo to film arrived in Shanghai on Nagasaki Maru on Monday. The group of twenty-four people included Japanese actors, directors, and technicians.

After arriving in Shanghai, they will transfer to Hangzhou to film the landing situation in Hangzhou Bay on November 5, 1937, as a scene for the film "Man and Earth."

### Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Awards Night, "Oscar" Gold Statues Divided into Three Sizes, Large, Medium, and Small

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences selects the most successful actors, actresses, and supporting stars of the past year every March and awards them the "Oscar" Gold Statue as a memorial and encouragement. This year's awards ceremony was also held recently. On this night, the entire Hollywood film city was sensational and crazy, especially the winning stars, who felt even more honored and noticed.

The best actor and actress selected were Spencer Tracy, who played the pastor in "Boys Town," and Bette Davis, who played the Southern woman in "Jezebel." Both of them won the award for the second time. Spencer Tracy happened to be ill when the award ceremony was held last year, and his wife accepted it on his behalf. This year, he won the award again and was able to personally accept this honor, so he was particularly happy. As for the best supporting actor and actress, they were Walter Brennan and Fay Bainter. The acting skills of the former in "Kentucky" and the latter in "Jezebel" were worthy of receiving the "Oscar" without shame. Under the eyes of thousands of pairs of eyes and cameras, they were each presented with the large "Oscar" Gold Statue by Mr. Frederick and Mr. Haverky.

In addition, there were two men and women who also received this supreme honor. The man was cartoonist Walt Disney, who won the award for producing "Snow White." He was awarded a large "Oscar" and seven small "Oscars" by Shirley Temple, symbolizing Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The woman was teenage singer Deanna Durbin, who was awarded a medium "Oscar" by Edgar Bergen, the father of "Mortimer Snerd" Charlie McCarthy (photo published on the ninth of this newspaper). Deanna's award was due to her successful performance from childhood to adolescence.

Among the many guests, the most eye-catching were Manuel Oberon, the son of the President of the United States (James Roosevelt, who recently joined the film industry and collaborated with Goldwyn), together with married couple Hedy Lamarr and Gene Markey, who had not been married long, also appeared together. Dolores del Río, who had not been divorced long, and Whitney Locke Moore, a film executive who specializes in discovering new talents, came together. Ginger Rogers, Alice Faye, and others were also chatting and laughing with their boyfriends at the banquet, showing a very intimate appearance.

### Shantou · In the Midst of a Frenzied Air Raid!

— Chen Xi

(Special Dispatch from Shantou by this newspaper) Shantou is in the midst of a frenzied air raid. The rubble from the bombing a few days ago (May 4-May 7) has not yet been cleared, and the bloodstains of our compatriots have not yet dried when, today (the 17th), they attacked again without any scruples!

At 8:30 a.m., the emergency alarm sounded like the wailing of ghosts. The short and miserable sound swirled in the air. Because of the many bloody lessons, people began to panic. They ran, cried, and stared blankly, as if a great disaster was imminent. The air raid shelters were crowded with people. Mothers hugged their children and trembled. Young men cursed...

Then, my keen hearing heard the "嗡嗡嗡..." sound of the planes. I put down my work and stood up to look out the window. The sun had already hidden its tearful eyes behind the miserable black clouds. The sky was extremely dim, and a gray curtain covered the earth. Usually, people take the old and young to flee to the reefs on the opposite bank every day, but who would have thought that such weather would provide an opportunity for an attack?

Three ×planes flew proudly extremely low. That sound pierced people's hearts like an awl. This is the prelude to the ferocity of the ×planes, and it is also a kind of omen in the space between people's birth and death!

Sure enough, the sound of continuous explosions "隆隆" spread, and even the windows were shaking. This is the sound that people are familiar with. When people hear this sound, they will instinctively shake, and they will immediately realize that buildings are collapsing one after another, and batches of compatriots are dying!

The machine gunners of the air defense unit fired back "咯咯". The cunning ×also swept down with machine guns. In this way, Shantou fell into an extremely terrifying deep trap. Apart from this terrifying sound, there was no sound at all. The space was only filled and permeated with the smell of gunpowder and blood!... (To be continued)

Movie Novel

### Pygmalion (6) Produced by MGM, Original by George Bernard Shaw, Starring Leslie Howard, Wendy Hiller

He and Pickering went to his mother's house to tell her, but she was not sympathetic and said, "She did those things for you, and you didn't thank her? Didn't praise her? And she threw a pair of slippers at you? If it were me, I really wouldn't forgive you like that!" She then took them into her own room. "Now promise me to behave properly." She then opened the door.

Eliza was sitting inside doing needlework. "Good morning, General Pickering. Good, you told her."

"!" The female reporter exclaimed. Higgins walked up to Pickering and said disappointedly, "This trick has been exposed."

Just then, the Queen Mother arrived. Everyone went to greet her. Suddenly Pickering said, "Higgins, look!"

An official led Eliza to the Queen. Eliza went forward to salute with a natural and unhurried manner.

The Queen reached out and stroked her cheek. "Beautiful girl," she said softly, "my son will definitely like to dance with you."

Eliza bowed her head and agreed. She began to dance with the Prince in a graceful manner.

Karpathy stood beside Higgins and smiled.

The female reporter begged, "Mr. Karpathy, please tell me, who exactly is Miss Doolittle?" She took out a pencil and paper from her bag.

But Karpathy shook his head, "This is my secret," he paused for a moment, "but I'm going to tell the Queen, she should know."

Higgins only felt a chill down his spine.

Karpathy continued, "She is——pretending!"

Alas, Higgins really didn't expect such a situation tonight.

Karpathy also said, "And she's not even English, no real Englishman can speak so beautifully. Only foreigners can do this with teaching. She's Hungarian." At this point, the guests nearby were paying attention to what he was saying. They were all very surprised to hear it.

"And——is a princess!" Karpathy finally said something shocking and even more amazing. (To be continued)

### South China Football Team Reschedules Southern Tour, Charity Match Held This Saturday, South China and All-Stars Form Battle Lines

(Special Dispatch from this newspaper) Carrying a new honor and about to depart on a southern tour, the South China football team was originally scheduled to start its first leg today, but "everything is ready except for the east wind," so the departure date has been postponed and will not be able to depart until the 30th of this month.

The charity match that was not held last Saturday due to rain can now be resumed due to the postponement of South China's departure. It will be performed at Jia Shan at 5:15 p.m. this Saturday.

It is still South China versus the All-Stars, and the lineups on both sides are slightly different from the previous ones. South China has been formed more rationally, and the opponent has only changed a few people.

South China has stopped leaving again, and has finally formed this football relationship with the general fans. Moreover, the expeditioners will not return until September. This meeting with the fans on the field will definitely strive for a performance, leaving a good pre-departure memory.

If both sides can fight with the original lineup at that time, it is expected that the situation will be pleasing to the eye. The two formations are arranged as follows:

(South China)

Bao Jiaping

Li Guowei Li Tiansheng

Liu Qingcai Liang Rongzhao Guo Yingqi

Luo Douwen Zhao Rong Ping Huitang Feng Jingxiang Deng Guangsen

Reserves: Yang Shuiyi, Mai Zhaomo, Liu Congsheng, Chen Dehui,

(All-Stars)

Dejiashen

Li Anna Hou Rongsheng

Xu Jingcheng Norris Xia Xian

Hou Chengtuo Zhuo Shijin Maurice Tuo Ban Yan Shidulang

Reserves: Li Deqi, Haniweilu, Zhuan Nibo Lu, He Xi,

...The reason for South China's postponement of this southern tour is not for anything else, but that there are still problems in the selection. Team Leader Mo has put a lot of effort into it, so he finally canceled today's departure. Here is some of what I know about the selection:

...Left winger Luo Douwen may not be able to make the trip due to some reasons. However, if Li Huitang joins the army and goes on an expedition, Douwen has always been favored by him, so he may be able to go with him.

..."Uncle Lu"'s son Lu Dakeng very much wants to participate in the precepts and go out to broaden his knowledge, so Uncle Lu has been planning for his son with all his strength, hoping that he can be selected to fulfill his wish. However, the overseas expedition is cautious in selecting materials, and Dakeng is still not qualified to enter the 'Hall of Elegance' at the moment, and I am afraid that he will eventually be in the list of abandoned materials.

...Guanghua's pillar Hou Rongsheng has decided to join South China and go on an expedition with the army. He will not enter the Guanghua gate again when he returns in the future.

...Mai Zhaohan's foot injury has not fully recovered, so he had to let the team go first and could not go with them. He will go to Singapore to rejoin the team after his injury recovers and join the expedition to the Dutch East Indies.

...South China specially asked the manager of the Swedish foreign company, Xia Lijian, to ask for leave for Li Huitang. According to Mr. Xia, there is no problem with Huitang's request for leave. However, Tan Jun'gan, who also works in the company, cannot go with him due to something. Lin Depu was very disappointed that he could not go on the expedition. He complained to Huitang a few days ago, but Huitang was only a member of the expedition and could not help.

...I heard that Eastern's left winger Hou Chengtuo has also been invited to tour the south. However, Chengtuo is a pillar of the East, and it is quite a problem to stay or leave, so he is still in consultation with South China.

In yesterday's school volleyball tournament, a total of three games were held in the senior, junior, and children's grades. In the senior Wah Yan vs. Yinghuang, Wah Yan only played with seven people due to insufficient numbers. Yinghuang, on the other hand, was fully staffed, so the strength was very different. After the competition, Yinghuang pressed from the left and right, and Wah Yan was busy parrying. It lost 0 to 3, the first set was 4 to 21, the second set was 15 to 21, and the third set was 16 to 21. The two formations are as follows:

Yinghuang

(Third Row)

Lin Zuozhi Jiang Yinghong Pan Shian

(Wah Yan) He Shuqin

Liu Rongzu Wu Zixing Bao Ruji

Huang Zicheng Zeng Duanri

In the junior Peiying vs. Southwest, the two sides were quite stalemate, but Peiying was strong, both offensively and defensively. Lu Fang was in the center to coordinate, and Zhou Gengshen, Huang Huahan, Zhu Zongquan, and Huang Jiyao's smashes were often successful. Gong Dechao, Liu Shumian, Wen Zhaobiao, Guan Baoze, Ling Zixin, and others from Southwest also tried their best to resist, but Peiying's military appearance was strong, and Southwest could not parry and eventually lost 0 to 1. The first set was 17 to 21, the second set was 18 to 21, and the third horse was 11 to 21. The barriers are as follows:

Peiying Southwest

### Preliminary Gymnastics

— Zou Falu

A. Individual Movements

(1) Parallel Foot Jump—In a standing position, jump forward continuously with feet together. Pay attention to using tiptoes for takeoff and landing.

(2) Zigzag Jump—Same posture as above, jump continuously zigzagging to the left and right obliquely.

(3) Circular Jump—Same posture as above, jump continuously in a circular pattern in four directions: left, front, right, back, or right, front, left, back. When circling, gradually move forward.

(4) Crisscross Jump—Same posture as above, jump continuously crisscrossing forward, left, right, back, or forward, right, left, back, and back, left, right, front in a cross shape. When jumping, gradually move forward.

(5) Rotary Jump—Same posture, when jumping up, rotate simultaneously in the air to the left or right. The degree of rotation can be increased from one-half turn to three-quarters turn, or one full turn, etc., depending on the practitioner's level. It is even better to be able to rotate continuously.

(6) Jumping Jack—One open-leg jump, one feet-together jump, alternating continuously. Move forward while performing.

(7) Staggered Leg Jump—One foot forward, one foot back, alternate left and right, jump continuously to move forward.

(8) Kneeling Jump to Stand—First, kneel on the mat with both feet, raise arms backward, then swing arms forward, and at the same time jump up with momentum. Kneel and jump alternately, continuously moving forward.

(9) One-Leg Jump—Jump forward continuously with one foot. Pay attention to alternating between the two feet. In addition to the parallel foot jump methods (2) to (5) mentioned above, the following three are also applicable:

(10) High Knee One-Leg Jump—When one foot jumps upward, the other foot simultaneously bends the knee and lifts it high.

(11) Leg Swing One-Leg Jump—When one foot jumps upward, the other foot simultaneously swings back and forth. In preparation, the non-jumping foot lifts backward. When the jumping foot takes off, swing it forward. When the jumping foot lands, swing it backward, just like the one-leg jump in a triple jump.

(12) Jump Over Toes—Grasp the right toe with the left hand, or the left toe with the right hand, then jump the foot standing on the mat over the toe being held. Before jumping, lift the toe being held slightly forward. When jumping up, quickly move it backward.

(13) Arch Jump—Jump high upward with feet together, and at the same time raise arms upward and backward, bend the body and lift the feet backward, so that the whole body forms an "arch" shape in the air. Slightly squat downward before jumping, raise arms backward, and return to this posture immediately after landing.

(14) Spread Eagle Jump—Jump high upward, raise arms in the air and spread legs into a "large" character shape. When landing, still stand upright with feet together.

(15) Jump and Pat Heels—Jump high upward, spread both feet apart and lift them backward, clap the heels with both hands in the air.

(16) Jump and Pat Toes—Jump high upward, join feet together or separate feet and kick forward as before, clap toes with both hands in the air.

(17) Jump and Clap Hands—Jump high upward, and clap hands in the air at the same time. When clapping hands, it can be divided into several types: forward, backward, upward, forward and backward, backward and forward, and upward, backward and forward.

When performing the above movements (13) to (17), the higher the jump, the more accurate the posture can be. Except for the jump and pat toes movement, the chest must be lifted up to show spirit.

(18) Squat Jump—The method is the same as the parallel foot jump, but it is performed in a squatting position. All the methods from (2) to (7) mentioned above can be applied to the squat jump. In addition, there are the following two types:

(19) Leg Extension Squat Jump—From the squatting position, jump up with one foot and extend the other foot forward. Alternate the movements of the two feet. When doing it for the first time, the extended foot can touch the mat, and gradually make it not touch the mat.

(20) Lateral Leg Extension Squat Jump—The jumping method is the same as above, but the method of extending the foot is changed to the side.

(21) Horizontal Roll Forward—Lie horizontally on the mat, hold head with both hands, roll forward.

(22) Fetal Roll Forward—Bend both feet, hold head with both hands, roll forward.

(23) Crawling—From the push-up position, crawl forward with hands and feet. It can be divided into moving hands and feet on the same side simultaneously and moving hands and feet on opposite sides simultaneously.

(24) Push-up Hand Walk—Same position as above, keep both feet still, move forward with both hands.

(25) Push-up Jump Walk—Same position as above, move forward or sideways by jumping with hands and feet simultaneously.

(26) Frog Jump—From a standing position, lean the upper body forward, jump forward with both hands supporting the mat, then raise both feet and jump forward. When the feet land, the hands jump forward as above. In this way, hands and feet leap forward alternately, continuously. This movement can also be divided into hands together and feet apart, and hands apart and feet together.

(27) Forward Fall—From a standing position, keep the whole body straight and fall forward. When the body is about to touch the mat, quickly extend both hands forward to support the mat. In this movement, pay attention to keeping the whole body in a straight line. When the hands support the mat, they must bend with the downward pressure of the upper body to reduce the impact of the hands and upper body on the mat.

(28) Forward Fall Thread-the-Legs Sit—After completing the forward fall movement as above, immediately push up the upper body with both arms, and quickly thread both feet forward through the middle of both hands, into a seated posture.

(29) Swallow Splits the Water—Assume a posture leaning forward, with both hands on the mat, and both feet raised upward with momentum, into a handstand position. Immediately bend both arms, and the whole body falls backward in an inverted "arch" shape, touching the mat sequentially with the chest, abdomen, legs, and feet. Pay attention to quickly lifting the chest, abdomen, and legs off the mat in sequence after they touch the mat, into a push-up posture.

(30) Swallow Splits the Water Thread-the-Legs Sit—First perform the swallow splits the water movement. When in the push-up position, immediately thread the legs forward between both hands, into a seated posture.

(31) Push-up Hand Jump—From the push-up position, use hands to make the upper body jump upward. When doing it, first bend both arms, then stretch them vigorously, and the upper body jumps upward at the same time with momentum.

(32) Push-up Jump and Clap Hands—Same method as above, clap hands in the air at the same time when jumping up. The position for clapping hands can be divided into the front of the chest and behind the back, and clapping three times at the same time or sequentially in front of the chest and behind the back.

(33) Push-up Jump and Twist—Same method as above, when jumping up, quickly twist the body to the left or right one full turn, and then return to the original position.

(34) Head and Hand Stand—Stand upside down using the head and both hands as a triangular fulcrum. Pay attention to raising the head, with the forehead touching the mat. Gradually shift the center of gravity from both hands to the middle of the head and hands. First lift the trunk, then the feet.

(35) Head and Elbow Stand—The method is the same as above, but the hands are replaced by elbows. It can be divided into holding the head and crossing the arms.

(36) Shoulder and Elbow Stand—Lie on your back, raise legs upward, place both hands on waist, use both elbows and the back of the head and shoulders as a triangular fulcrum to make the whole body stand upside down. If the head cannot be bent forward sufficiently, use the upper back instead of the shoulders.

(37) Handstand—Use both hands as fulcrums to stand upside down with legs extended. Pay attention to raising the head, looking forward, fingertips must be forward, the whole body forms an inverted arch shape, the feet must move back and forth at any time to maintain the center of gravity.　(End of Section 2)

Economic Column Comments

### The So-Called [Huaxing Commercial Bank] and Its Role

— Han Hui

However, after Chinese merchants collected this military currency, they quickly went to Shanghai or other commercial ports to purchase Japanese loans and Japanese goods from Japanese merchants. Although the import of Japanese goods is increasing dramatically, its purpose of obtaining industrial raw materials and food for free has not been achieved. On the contrary, it has wasted the foreign exchange export resources that could have been obtained. Although Japanese small and medium-sized merchants do not dare to openly refuse military currency, they are already complaining. The original intention of Japan was that this military currency could alleviate its crisis of malignant inflation, but now it has completely failed. Therefore, the "Huaxing Bank" established this time is formally different from the "United Reserve Bank" in the north. The main differences are two:

First, the difference in nature. The "United Reserve Bank" was jointly established by the "Beijing Provisional Government" and by forcing various banks in the north. "Huaxing" is invested by the "Nanjing Reformed Government" and the six major Japanese banks. Although the former can establish credit loans with the Chaoyang Bank, it is not directly invested by Japanese banks. The latter is very clearly a joint stock company of the six major Japanese banks. Moreover, the word "Commercial" is added under the words "Huaxing", which is even more comparable to the so-called "National Bank" nature of the "United Reserve Bank".

Second, the difference in denomination: The "United Reserve Bank" notes are at par with the Japanese yen and function as a substitute for legal tender (its failure has been described above). It is said that "Huaxing" notes use legal tender as a reserve and are not linked to the Japanese yen.

As for the function of issuing "Huaxing" notes, there are approximately four items:

(1) Japan uses "Huaxing" notes in the Japanese-occupied areas and absorbs foreign exchange in the Shanghai "black market" to erode the reserve funds of legal tender, in order to increase its payment power for its invasion of China military expenses.

(2) Japan wants to use "Huaxing" notes to plunder industrial raw materials and food from the occupied areas on a long-term and unlimited basis, and refuse Chinese merchants to directly purchase Japanese goods with "Huaxing" notes, so that Japanese small and medium-sized merchants will not have the pain of receiving military currency again.

(3) The Japanese puppets use "Huaxing" notes to pay part of the expenses of the Japanese troops stationed in China and the expenses of the puppet organizations, in order to make up for the financial panic of both the Japanese and the puppets.

(4) "Huaxing" Bank will be the agency for Japan to control foreign exchange and foreign trade in Shanghai and Jiangnan. It will force export merchants to sell foreign exchange to "Huaxing". In this way, on the one hand, it can replenish the reserves of the Japanese yen, and on the other hand, it can use the monopoly of Changjiang (Yangtze River) and inland waterway transportation to promote the import of Japanese goods and squeeze out the market for European and American goods, that is, it wants to increase its capital accumulation by expanding commodity exports.

The above four functions can be said to be progressing simultaneously. Its ultimate goal is nothing more than rejecting the economic interests of the United Kingdom and the United States, destroying the legal tender system, and completing the pipe dream that the Shanghai financial market will also join the yen bloc. However, this kind of goal is absolutely impossible to realize.

First, if "Huaxing" notes are used to exchange for legal tender, because the credit of legal tender is stable and the amount of "Huaxing" notes issued is unlimited, the people in the occupied areas will inevitably hoard legal tender, and the tragic decline in the price of "Huaxing" notes is inevitable.

Second, as a result of the excessive issuance of "Huaxing" notes, the price of goods in the occupied areas will inevitably soar. Not only will Japan's procurement of agricultural products from Jiangnan to fill industrial raw materials and food be hit, but also the reduction in the purchasing power of people in the occupied areas will greatly reduce the import of Japanese goods.

Third, the plummeting price of "Huaxing" notes and the soaring prices will inevitably lead to the bankruptcy of Chinese merchants in the war zone, and the finances of the puppet organization, which rely on urban merchants, will inevitably become even more panic-stricken, and the method of providing supplies for the Japanese army locally will inevitably become more difficult.

Fourth, if Japan uses "Huaxing" Bank to control foreign exchange in Shanghai, it is objectively difficult to succeed.

The above contradictions are the inevitable result of the issuance of "Huaxing" notes. Not only will it not help Japan's economic institutions, but it will accelerate its collapse. Japan has seen this crisis, so it has not yet implemented a plan to actually control Shanghai's foreign exchange. It wants to use other means to induce the cooperation of Chinese and American merchants. The hope of its success is even more. The "Federated Reserve" was the prelude, but there has been no follow-up to this day, which shows the high degree of self-doubt.

### A Defense of New Poetry

— Xing Guangzu

Those who promoted new literature in the early days went through many difficulties and finally cut down those "stubborn" vines. Over the years, relying on the cultivation and irrigation of many new writers, many beautiful flowers have already been produced in the garden of new literature. However, in recent years, there have been plants grown from the same seed that are hindering the growth of other plants in this garden, which I think is a pity.

I have always thought that the entire new literary movement is a movement of new poetry. If you don't believe it, we can cite some examples. Some essays were written in vernacular Chinese, such as the essays of the Ming and Qing dynasties. Cao Xueqin and Shi Nai'an were pioneers in writing novels in vernacular Chinese. Yuan Dynasty operas (especially those recitatives) were written in vernacular Chinese. As for writing poetry in vernacular Chinese, it is purely a product of the new literary movement. Although Bai Juyi wanted to make his poems "understandable to old women," it was only a theory of poetry, not a practice. Moreover, if we look at Mr. Hu Shih's article "Bian Shang Liang Shan" in the Collection of Literary Theories of the Good Companion New Literature System, we will understand that his literary revolution advocated writing poetry in vernacular Chinese as the backbone. Therefore, new poetry is a special product of the new literary movement and the mastermind of the new literary movement; those who denigrate new poetry are denigrating the new literary movement.

Those who denigrate new poetry, in addition to the "possessed" figures mentioned by Peng Xiaoshu earlier, surprisingly include some playwrights. Ding Xilin satirized new poetry in his one-act play "A Wasp," but it seems to have been eroded by time and is no longer noticed. More recently, A Ying's "Spring Breeze Autumn Rain" used the voice of Professor Ni in the play to praise his lover Feng Yun with several "crooked" poems, and the recent play adapted by Feng Zhizhong called "Pretending" has a large section that mocks new poetry and pretends to be very powerful. However, although new poetry has gone through the poisonous sting of a wasp, it still exists巍然. Spring Breeze Autumn Rain is only temporarily confusing people. As for pretending, it only makes people feel its affectation and hypocrisy.

I remember that R.L. Stevenson once said: "I often suspect that public taste is a mixed product, a combination of adherence to old habits and hypocrisy." For new poetry, those stubborn factions take a contemptuous attitude, precisely because their adherence to old habits is too deep. As for those literary figures who satirize new poetry, it is only because they lack a deep understanding and research on new poetry. Either they do not read new poetry, or they only taste new poetry superficially. Both factions have not entered the door and are vulgar people. Not enough to talk about poetry. "Saying Poetry in Brief" once said, "Good poetry is the medicine for vulgar people." I also hold the same view. These "vulgar" people must eliminate their discriminatory psychology and read more new poetry collections.

Perhaps the general playwrights who satirize new poetry do not have any preconceived notions. Using a little satire in a play is just like a drugstore advertisement, just to attract more audiences. For example, a poem written in Feng Zhizhong's "Pretending" (no quotation marks are necessary): "Ah, ah, ah! The sky does not leave, and the earth does not stay. That's okay. I secretly glanced at you, and your two light bulb-like eyes stole my heart. Thief, thief!" "I remember this from the lines of the actors of the Sino-French Drama Society, or there may be errors." He inserted this passage in the play, perhaps to exchange the laughter of the audience for incongruous words. If this is the case, then we must also demand the author's sound artistic conscience.

At the same time, we must also reflect on ourselves to examine the existing new poetry scene. Of course, we cannot deny that many new poems are indeed flawed and naive. Over the years, the advancement has been like a slow ox, which will indeed make people who love to watch the excitement anxious. However, I always believe that naivety is not enough to criticize new poetry. Time is still long, and great instruments are always late to be completed. (As long as you don't die young, you will always see the season when it blooms and thrives. (Moreover, in new literature, whether it is essays, novels, or dramas, they all suffer from the same symptoms. Who can say that Cao Yu's "Sunrise" and Sun Yutang's eight-hundred-line long poem "Baoma" are not superior or inferior? Here, I, like Mr. Shao Xunmei, want to use Mr. Lin Yutang's tone to say: "The success of new literature is also the success of new poetry."

The reason why new poetry is not well-known in new literature is, according to some people: "We only have people who write new poetry, but no people who read new poetry." The editor of any magazine always feels that there are the most submissions for new poetry; while all booksellers feel that the sales of poetry magazines and poetry collections are the least. According to my speculation, the reason why this deformed phenomenon exists is nothing more than two points: one is because poets are mostly solitary and self-appreciating, and the best poets who do not like to publicize are usually the most clumsy advertising promoters. And poets have their own complete personality and noble taste, and they will never cater to the masses and try their best to accommodate them. Another point is that those who engage in literature and art or poetry critics lack sympathy and encouragement. This kind of passionless criticism and cold ridicule is usually the trick of those snobs.

Finally, we have to thank those who ridicule new poetry, because "satire is a friend with good intentions," as Churchill said. At the same time, we must also advise those who ridicule new poetry, because Bacon said well: "Those who have a temperament of ridiculing others and who make people afraid of the sharpness of their wit must worry about people remembering them forever."

### Song Without Sound

— Yang Yanqi

When I'm lonely, the coldness in my heart can't help but create empty sorrows from fantasy, like falling into the deep cracks of the earth, falling into a bottomless abyss.

A cold body stirs up silent thoughts.

I want to sing, sing a song without sound.

I remember (actually a beautiful and touching lie) many years ago, heaven and earth were the same, and there was no distinction between humans and gods. The spring wind is like a wisp of light smoke, floating a goddess-like figure in the air – do you believe it? Do you believe that there has ever been peace on earth?

Friends, don't wander – besides the goddess, you should also know that there are devils. Devils, yes, devils were also rampant for a while before sunset. It smashed the statue of the goddess and also broke the high monument of peace. But you should also understand that the sun rises from the east, and although it is powerful at noon, it finally sets in the west.

I also remember the scenery I loved to watch most when I was young, the sunset on the lake.

It's Xuanwu Lake. In the cracks of the willow branches, in the red clouds, I saw the blood wheel sink under the bricks and stones of the Taicheng. At that time, the color of the lake, the air of the lake, and the rhythm of the lake made up a landscape painting by Apollo.

Also in the corridor in front of the Yilan Hall of Beihai, on the banks of Fangshan, to the left and right of the Five Dragon Pavilion, I once left a not deep or light trace. Now it is March weather again, and the beautiful scenery of the sunset is on the market again. In the deep cracks of the earth, in the bottomless abyss, I picked up a piece of memory. Nanjing and Beiping, although not my hometown, are still kind homelands, worth taking out a trace of sentiment from this piece of memory and leaving it on the eyeballs and beside the nerves, for me to rely on when I am lonely.

I want to sing, sing a song without sound.

But I hear a bass sound in the distance, chanting the power of life.

Look, a blue flower floats from the sky – it is a star point that the goddess sprinkles on the blue sky. It is a wisp of soft hair on the head of the universe – it is the source of life in heaven and earth.

When I remember the beautiful sunset scenery that I was happy to see in the old days, I smiled. In my meditation, the sun floats on the water, playing a cheerful tune. Passing through the water, in the depths of the mud, there are also traces of devils sinking to the bottom of the water.

Isn't it true that although the sun is powerful at noon, it finally sets in the west.

I want to sing, sing a song without sound.

But a cold body embraces the silent thoughts: Raising my head, I see a blue flower again, that eternal beauty.

### "Charity Sale" and "Charity Giving"

— Ding San

Recently, students from a certain school in Shanghai sewed handkerchiefs, made paper flowers, and held charity sales to donate money. This shows that young students have a way to save the country. Doing small-scale production, small-scale charity sales, and small-scale donations like this is also a way to save the country, without necessarily having to go to the front lines to wave flags and shout.

Previously, Class A of the first grade of that school [a total of more than forty people] raised more than sixty yuan, bought eighteen dozen pairs of black socks, and walked a long distance to the Isolated Battalion one Sunday afternoon to offer comfort. When buying socks, the owner of the sock factory heard that they were going to comfort the Isolated Army, and that the Isolated Army was in need of socks (this they learned after inquiring by letter), so he added two more dozens, making a total of twenty dozens. These students selling socks from their own pockets to offer comfort can be said to be "charity giving," and the sock factory owner adding socks as a gift is naturally also "charity giving." Why "charity giving"? Because those more than three hundred isolated soldiers fought to the death to defend the country, bled to love the country, and in the future, they will certainly be able to fight for the country again. In short, it is for the sake of "saving the country."

In the past two months, I have "charity-sold" and "charity-given," but due to the complexity of trivial matters, mental stagnation, and the addition of chills and fever, and headaches, I have not been able to properly pick up a pen to do "business," so I have not followed the "cultural workers' charity sale movement," which I really feel ashamed of. However, I have provided articles "charity-given" to the publications and wall newspapers organized by the students four or five times. Giving "charity-given" articles several times in this way may seem unrelated to the country, but in fact, it has a considerable relationship—for the sake of a special influence, even a very small part of the influence!

"Charity sales" are completely "donations," so those who "charity-sell" should also have a "donation" mindset, and not dislike the roughness of the goods, but should generously take out a few more coins.

As for "charity giving," sending money and sending goods are naturally good, but sending strength and sending spirit are also not bad. As long as it is beneficial to the war of resistance and national construction, then no matter what is sent, no matter to whom it is sent, it is good. For people like me who cannot make ends meet, to be honest, although I cannot send a lot of money and goods, I can send strength and send spirit.

Since the war of resistance, many soldiers have given their flesh and blood, their lives, to the country. Those who have not lost their lives, and those who have extra strength, extra spirit, extra money, and those who are prosperous and making a fortune from the war of resistance, if they are still unwilling to "charity give," then they are not worthy of being citizens of China, and they should be ashamed!

Therefore, I advocate that the movement of "charity sales" and donating money should be expanded and continued, but further, we should intensify the movement of "charity giving" donating money, donating goods, donating strength, and donating spirit, expand it, and promote it!

Everyone, let us rise up for the war of resistance and national construction and "charity-sell" and "charity-give"!

### Selling Beans (Part 1)

— Ming Zhe

—Grandma's Story—

Orders came down from above to attack Qingzhen.

Originally, we were in the business of attacking, so naturally we should proceed. However, Captain Wang Mingyuan and several other captains, after discussing, could not help but hesitate, because we did not know the real situation in Qingzhen. We could not make complete arrangements, so we could not go rashly. I said, this matter still requires asking Grandma.

As soon as I mentioned Grandma, everyone laughed. "Okay, go and invite Grandma over right away," Wang Mingyuan said.

Grandma, not knowing what she was doing, dusted off her clothes and came out from inside.

"Are you familiar with Qingzhen?" Wang Mingyuan asked.

"Very familiar; I have a niece living in that town."

"Do you know how many 'people' there are, how many guns, how many cannons in Qingzhen now?"

"I don't know about that."

"Do you have a way to find out?"

Grandma thought for a moment and nodded, saying, "I have a way; give me three days to reply, okay?"

After agreeing on this, she went to prepare, seemingly busy all night. The next day, she carried several bags of things alone and went to her niece Qian Asen's house.

She said to Qian Asen, "Recently, there has been no spending money at home, and I was thinking of coming to the town to do some small business." She poured out the things in the cloth bag. When Qian Asen saw it, it turned out to be various kinds of edible broad beans. Qian Asen didn't think much of it, because such things are often done by real rural old women.

Early the next morning, she borrowed a shallow-rimmed large basket from Qian Asen, put all kinds of beans in it, and went to the street to sell them. She had already inquired that the place where those people were stationed was the Public Cocoon Firm, so she went straight to the large teahouse opposite the Cocoon Firm.

After selling some broad beans briefly in the teahouse, she walked to the window facing the street and stared at the gate of the Cocoon Firm across the street without leaving. People were standing guard at the entrance of the Cocoon Firm, and many people were going in and out. She stared intently, as if looking for a familiar face, and sometimes forgot about the beans when someone called her.

"Old woman, why aren't you doing business and just staring at the opposite side?" A bored teahouse customer said this. (To be continued)

### Shi Dakai's True Poem

— Luo Yong

On May 17th, from Zitanli, Mr. Zou Xiao's "Shi Dakai's Poems" mentioned my humble compilation of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Poems and Essays, so I will also talk about it.

It is indeed true that Shi Dakai, the Wing King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, was skilled in poetry and prose, but eighty or ninety percent of the works that have been passed down are forgeries. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Poems and Essays includes about five or six of his articles. Strictly speaking, only the official certificate issued to Prime Minister Yang Fuguang is a true relic. However, this official certificate was probably written by his staff and cannot be considered Shi Dakai's own work. Even the one or two essays copied from the "Rebel" Situation Compilation are undoubtedly true, but at the same time, they are also the work of his staff. In addition, after examining several official documents using the official system and customs of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, it can be determined that they are works forged by later generations. Even those famous sentences like "Endure allowing the clothing and culture of the superior nation to be submerged by the barbarians; Join together the heroes of the Central Plains, and return our rivers and mountains to us," although passionate and慷慨, even Mr. Liang Qichao was deceived and praised them. In fact, they are still forgeries by later generations, not Shi Wing King's own work. As for Shi Dakai's poems, from Gao Tianmei's Shi Dakai's Poetry Collection to Lu Yeye's Shi Dakai's Poetry Collection, to my humble compilation of Poems and Essays, although there are some differences in what is collected, Mr. Liu Yazi's letter to me proves that they are all forged by Mr. Gao Tianmei. (Even those two famous sentences "My ambition has not been fulfilled, and people have already suffered; There are tearful marks everywhere in the southeast" are also forged.) This is the strongest evidence. From this, it can be said that all the poems of Shi Dakai that we have seen so far are forgeries by later generations, and not a single one is true. (As for Xu Zhiyan's embellished Shi Dakai's Diary, it is completely a novelist's fabrication and is not credible. Scholars have already made a final judgment on this and there is no need to elaborate.) If that is the case, does it mean that Shi Dakai, who could write poetry, did not leave a single poem behind? That is not entirely the case. Shi Dakai does have a true poem, which is still deeply engraved on the stone wall of Bailong Cave in Guanshan County, Guangxi. This poem was written by Shi Dakai when he visited Bailong before entering Sichuan. In front of it is Shi's preface, along with a five-character律詩 he wrote. Behind it are ten poems by his staff Zhang Suimou and others, and a poem by Liu Yunqing of Hunan. In addition to these poems, there is also a seven-character古詩 by Jiang You Li Langgu, Minister of the Household Department of the Wing Palace, entitled "Visiting Bailong Cave in the Late Autumn of the Year Yiwei, Cherishing the Past." All of the above poems were carefully copied and sent to me in June of the 26th year of the Republic of China by Mr. Chen Qingyu, the magistrate of Yishan County. Although there are transcriptions circulating outside, there are many errors. What I rely on is the original stone inscription, which is of course reliable. Unfortunately, the fourth edition of Poems and Essays after the national crisis has already been printed and cannot be included, so it can only be compiled in the sequel to Poems and Essays. At the same time, I am currently writing a biography of the figures in the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and have written an article about Shi Wing King's subordinates based on these stone inscriptions. Now, I will copy Shi Dakai's preface and poem below so that we can all admire the true works of a national hero.

The preface states: "In the tenth year of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Gengshen, the army was stationed in Qingyuan. At the time of late spring, I took advantage of my political leisure to inspect the fragrant suburbs with the high-ranking officials. The mountains and rivers competed in beauty, and the 革木爭妍. I climbed this ancient cave, and poems were arranged like jade, and the rhyme was refined and elegant. I then saw Liu Yunqing's sentence on the white wall, which implied lofty meaning and used heroic words, and had the general idea of rejecting Buddha and eliminating evil. I greatly appreciated it, so I ordered his poem to be engraved on stone as a warning to those who are obsessed with immortals and Buddhas. I and the officials also composed several chapters on the original rhyme, all of which were engraved on stone to commemorate the tour." The poem says: "Standing up and climbing the high mountains, Lifting my eyes to shine on the distant sky. Destroying Buddha and worshiping the Heavenly Emperor, Moving people back to the ancient ways. Commanding the army and praising the bravery, Playing in the cave and admiring the poetic heroes. The sword's aura soared to the stars, The light of literature shot at the rainbow of the sun."
