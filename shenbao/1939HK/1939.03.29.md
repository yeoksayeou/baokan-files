### Commemorating the Martyrs of Huanghuagang

Twenty-eight years ago (1910), seventy-two revolutionary patriots of Guangdong gave their lives for the country. The heroic actions of the seventy-two martyrs spurred the Xinhai Revolution against autocratic rule and laid the foundation for the Republic of China. As the entire nation unites to resist Japan and save the country, we commemorate this great and heroic day, recalling the spirit of the martyrs who bravely fought and sacrificed themselves to save the nation twenty-eight years ago. With solemn reverence, we should further realize the great significance of sincere unity in driving out the Japanese invaders and safeguarding the Republic of China.

In order to strive for the liberation of the Chinese nation, Mr. Sun Yat-sen first sought to liberate the entire nation from the feudal autocratic politics that exploited and used them. He transformed the Xingzhonghui into the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), uniting various domestic mass organizations and secret societies such as the Gelaohui, to carry out revolutionary actions against feudal autocracy. The revolutionary wave spread to all regions, including the military. Although the Guangdong New Army Uprising in 1910 was suppressed, the momentous Huanghuagang Uprising, which shook China and the world, ultimately erupted. At that time, the Tongmenghui established a command headquarters in Hong Kong, with Huang Xing as the commander-in-chief, and Xie Shimuh raised funds from overseas Chinese in Nanyang. On one hand, they planned and prepared for an armed uprising, and on the other hand, they sent people to mobilize the New Army and the Defense Battalion, preparing to attack and occupy various important institutions in Guangzhou from different directions, and to join forces with the New Army inside and outside the city. Unfortunately, the secret of the uprising was leaked, and the Guangdong Governor Zhang Mingqi issued an order for strict alert, searching and arresting party members everywhere. Huang Xing and more than a hundred comrades attacked the Governor's Office, but were immediately surrounded and captured by Qing soldiers. Seventy-two people died on the spot, and Huang Xing was wounded and escaped to Hong Kong. Afterwards, the Guangdong provincial authorities implemented a policy of terror, and party members and people who cut their queues suffered massacres. Some people buried the seventy-two martyrs who died for the country in Honghuagang, renaming Honghuagang as Huanghuagang. Later, this uprising was called the Huanghuagang Uprising.

Although the Huanghuagang Uprising failed, it promoted the revolutionary situation in the country, sparked a great wave of anger among the masses against the autocratic government of the Qing Dynasty, and unfolded the prelude to the Wuchang Uprising and the establishment of a democratic republic. Its great historical significance is something that every patriotic and freedom-loving citizen cannot forget. Especially today, as we unite the whole country to resist the brutal Japanese for the sake of national liberation, commemorating the seventy-two martyrs who died in the Huanghuagang Uprising, and Huang Xing, Deng Zhongyuan, Chen Yingshi, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, and countless other warriors who sacrificed themselves for the liberation of the Chinese nation, we should first emulate the spirit of the martyrs in the practical work of resisting the war and building the nation, adhering to perseverance for the sake of national liberation, remaining unyielding in the face of danger, and not shirking from sacrifice for the country. We must use the spirit of the martyrs, which is tied to the national vitality, to enhance national self-esteem; we must use the article "Resistance War will be victorious, and nation-building will be successful" to strengthen national self-confidence; we must overcome all pessimistic and despairing emotions, and shatter the arguments for peace and compromise. At this time, as the War of Resistance turns to the second stage, at this moment of life and death for the Chinese nation, we should, on the one hand, thoroughly eliminate those national traitors and pro-Japanese elements and all puppet regimes who are willing to implement the enemy's "using Chinese to control Chinese" poisonous scheme. Thoroughly eliminate all their words and actions that violate the united resistance to Japan, such as "anti-communism" and "advocating peace." On the other hand, we must also consolidate the united front for resisting the war and building the nation. We must eliminate those who are afraid of difficulties, seek only ease, are insidious, suspicious, disheartened, and demoralized. We must intensify the close cooperation of all parties, all ethnic groups, and all classes in resisting Japan.

In their struggle for national liberation, the revolutionary martyrs also left us extremely valuable experiences and lessons, which we should faithfully emulate today in the arduous stage of resisting Japan and building the nation. First, the struggle of the martyrs was carried out under the leadership of the great leader Mr. Sun Yat-sen. They faithfully supported the four major programs put forward by Mr. Sun at that time: "Expel the Tartars, restore China, establish a republic, and equalize land ownership," and ultimately laid the foundation for the establishment of the Republic of China. Today, we must complete the unfinished ambitions of Mr. Sun and the martyrs, persist in resisting the war under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, drive out the Japanese invaders, recover lost territories, promote democratic politics, improve the lives of workers, peasants, and the general public, and establish a democratic republic based on the Three Principles of the People. Second, although the revolutionary struggles of the martyrs failed, they used the internal contradictions of the Qing court at that time to penetrate into various regions, win over the Qing court's troops, and promote equality and mutual assistance among all ethnic groups in the country, thereby enhancing the strength of the revolution. These methods of struggle were the main conditions for the success of the Xinhai Revolution. Today, we must strive to learn from them, on the one hand, intensify propaganda against the enemy and the puppets, encourage them to go to the enemy's rear, win over the puppet troops, and disintegrate the enemy's army; on the other hand, strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups, all parties, and all classes in the country; through these two aspects of efforts, consolidate and expand the anti-Japanese national united front, in order to achieve the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance and the inevitable success of nation-building. Third, in their struggles at that time, the revolutionary martyrs already knew that they must rely on the masses and rely on overseas Chinese. They spared no effort in propaganda and organizational work. Later, the Xinhai Revolution and the Northern Expedition were able to obtain the enthusiastic support of the domestic masses and overseas compatriots. Today, we should trust the masses, rely on the masses, and organize the masses, and widely implement propaganda and organization among overseas Chinese, so as to use the spirit of democratic revolution to inspire the enthusiasm of the domestic masses and overseas compatriots in resisting the war and building the nation, realize the total mobilization of the national spirit and material resources, strive for the final victory of the long-term War of Resistance, and promote the construction of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People.

### China's Economic Construction in Rapid Development

(Special dispatch from Chongqing by our newspaper) The Ministry of Economic Affairs was formed last January by merging the former Ministry of Industry, the Construction Committee, and the water conservancy section of the National Economic Council, as well as various directly affiliated agencies. The National Government specially appointed Weng Wenhao, the former director of the Second and Fourth Departments of the Reconstruction Committee, as the minister. Suited to the needs of wartime, he carefully planned and established six divisions: General Affairs, Agriculture and Forestry, Mining, Industry, Commerce, and Water Conservancy. In addition to the original bureaus, offices, and committees of the aforementioned agencies, with regard to agriculture, an Agricultural Adjustment Office was newly established in the Rural Finance Bureau to handle agricultural adjustment affairs during the extraordinary period. A Cooperative Guidance Office was established to promote cooperative undertakings. In addition, the Central Agricultural Experiment Station was established to manage the experiment, improvement, investigation, research, and technical personnel training of agriculture and forestry. The Jinshui River Basin Farm was established to manage agricultural affairs in the Jinshui River Basin near Wuchang. The Agricultural Evaluation Committee was established to discuss and study agricultural construction plans. With regard to industry, a Special Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office was established to handle industrial and mining adjustment affairs during the extraordinary period. The Mining and Metallurgy Research Institute was established to study mining and metallurgy techniques. The Fuel Management Office was established to plan the production, transportation, distribution, and storage of fuel during the extraordinary period. The Central Industrial Experiment Station was established to test industrial raw materials, improve manufacturing methods, and appraise industrial products. The Resources Committee was established to develop and manage important resources, and jointly with the Ministry of Education, a Small Industry Promotion Design Committee was established to design and increase production capacity. With regard to water conservancy, the Central Hydraulic Engineering Experiment Station was established to conduct hydraulic experiments and water conservancy research. The Meihui Canal Management Office of the Guanluo Engineering Bureau was established to manage the affairs of the Meihui Canal. In addition, a Special Appeals Review Committee was established to handle appeal cases, and a Joint Venture Supervision Committee was established to supervise various joint ventures. Over the past year, he has been strategizing and planning, working hard for the country. It can be said that he has entered into everything that can develop the national economy. The reporter recently visited him and was privileged to hear a detailed discussion of the economic and administrative facilities of the past year, which is specially recorded to enrich this newspaper and benefit readers.

Constructing Agriculture

The economic administration since the establishment of the Ministry of Economic Affairs can be divided into four categories: agriculture, industry and mining, commerce, and water conservancy projects. (1) Agriculture: The following six items are given special attention in agricultural production: (A) Agricultural Water Conservancy: The weather in the Northwest is dry, and water diversion for irrigation is especially important. There are many water channel projects implemented in Shaanxi. The Meihui Canal has been completed, irrigating 200,000 mu of farmland. The Luohui Canal project is the largest and is still in progress, irrigating 500,000 mu of farmland. Another 200,000 mu of farmland will be irrigated by the Youhui Canal, and 100,000 mu of farmland will be irrigated by the Heihe Canal. All of these projects began construction last winter. Within Gansu Province, the Yinhe Canal has been completed, and the Huihe Canal will begin construction this spring. Each can irrigate tens of thousands of mu. The southwestern provinces are also proceeding separately. Sichuan can irrigate a total of 200,000 mu, Guangxi 190,000 mu, and Hunan about 200,000 mu. Compared with the Northwest, the cost is often high and the amount of irrigated land is small. Yunnan should also select a site for implementation. (B) Increasing Agricultural Production: There are regulations to increase grain production in the Northwest and cotton production in the Southwest. Last year's harvest has been estimated by the Agricultural Experiment Station. Compared with the previous year, the wheat fields in Shaanxi Province increased by 2 million mu, and the output increased by 12 million dan. Sichuan produced more than 900,000 dan of cotton, about double that of the previous year. This is because the government purchased and distributed 58 million dan of American cotton seeds last year, promoting more than 14,000 mu of cotton fields. Work is currently being planned to continue. (C) Planning Reclamation: The focus is on assigning specialized personnel to inspect the situation of wasteland in various provinces and discuss reclamation methods. The provinces that have implemented migration and reclamation are Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian. The ministry has also issued a request to the relevant ministries and commissions to draft the Rules for Migration and Reclamation in Extraordinary Times, which has been promulgated by the government and can be used as a criterion for handling land reclamation in various places. (D) Developing Cooperation: It is intended to promote the cooperative treasury to establish the basic organization of rural finance. As of the beginning of December last year, 47 gold mines have been established, distributed in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Jiangxi and other provinces, subscribing and promoting a capital stock of about 7 million yuan, with 2.5 million yuan actually allocated. On the one hand, agricultural warehouses are being newly established in various places in the rear. A total of 20 warehouses have been established recently, and 40 are under preparation, mostly in Sichuan Province. This is because agricultural warehouses are also the basic organizations for adjusting production and sales. (E) Agricultural Loans: In Sichuan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces, the Mountain Department cooperates with local governments that are engaged in water conservancy to provide farmland water conservancy loans. There are also production loans, including the supply of seeds, fertilizers, and plowing cattle, which are widely distributed. As of November last year, the former had been set at 8.3 million yuan, and the latter had been set at 4,871,000 yuan. In addition, there are commercial agricultural product loans totaling 2 million yuan, and agricultural improvement subsidies totaling more than 81,000 yuan. (F) Agricultural Product Transportation and Sales: Grain is handled separately in Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Shaanxi; cotton, yarn, and cloth are handled in Shaanxi, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, and Zhejiang, and transported to the rear. As of November last year, the total value of cotton, yarn, cloth, rice, wheat purchased was 10,175,600 yuan. In addition, the governments of Henan, Sichuan, and Guizhou provided transportation and sales loans totaling 2.7 million yuan.

Developing Industry and Mining

(2) Industry and Mining: All facilities for industry and mining are aimed at increasing production capacity in the rear, developing important production in the interior, and supplying the urgent needs of national defense. Either state-owned or privately-operated, both are advanced simultaneously. (A) State-owned enterprises: Generally, they require more capital and are intended to lay the foundation for large-scale operations, quickly achieve results, focus on increasing national industries, and not compete with the people for profits. They must create a model for operating enterprises and fulfill their responsibility to contribute to the national economy and the people's livelihood. 1. To supply the basic materials necessary for national defense, the important parts of the Hanyang Iron and Steel Plant and the Daye Iron Mine have been transported inward after consultation with the Ordnance Administration. The Liuhegou Iron Smelting Furnace has also been purchased and transported inward, so as to select a site to build another copper and iron plant, costing more than 10 million yuan. The Resources Committee has also established a copper plant in Hunan Province to refine pure copper. Now it is being built in Sichuan Province, and the copper mines in northern Yunnan are being acquired to jointly operate, in order to increase production and at least meet part of the needs. Oil is also being operated in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. 2. To establish basic manufacturing industries, a machine factory has been established in Yunnan Province, with equipment worth about 5 million yuan, which can start manufacturing industrial machinery, tools, and prime movers. In addition, four electrical equipment factories have been established in Yunnan and Guangxi, with a capital of 5 million yuan, which can produce electrical wires, telephones, transmitting and receiving tubes, light bulbs, batteries, transformers, etc. An alcohol factory has been established in Sichuan to manufacture high-concentration alcohol. 3. To improve and develop important export minerals, tungsten and antimony mines are centrally managed and have made progress. The Resources Committee and the Guangxi Provincial Government jointly established the Pinggui Mining Bureau, with a capital of 5 million yuan, which can increase tin production by about 1,000 tons per year. They also jointly operate the Wuxi Mercury Mine with Guizhou Province to increase mercury production. 4. To supply civilian and industrial use. Recently, electricity has been increased in Lanzhou, Wanxian, Guiyang, and other places. New power plants have also been established in Hanzhong, Chenxi, Yuanling, Kunming, and other places, costing about 3 million yuan. 5. To enrich foreign exchange funds and consolidate finance, gold mines are being produced in Qinghai, Sichuan, Kang, Hunan, and Guangxi, and prices are being negotiated with the Ministry of Finance to purchase gold produced in various places. (B) Private Enterprises: Except for a few important enterprises that are state-owned, all national economic construction depends on encouraging and assisting private enterprises. The National Government has promulgated the revised Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce in Extraordinary Times, so that the competent authorities can supervise and lead with a basis. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently drafted the Regulations on the Assistance to Industry and Mining in Extraordinary Times, which has also been promulgated by the National Government, in order to provide further assistance in addition to what is stipulated in the usual laws and regulations, and to draft the Measures for Encouraging Overseas Chinese to Invest in Domestic Economic Enterprises, in order to use the capital of overseas Chinese to promote the economic development of the interior.

Assisting Border Factories

During the military period, in order to protect the equipment in the front and increase production in the interior, the government provided assistance in many ways. First, the machinery, materials, and technical personnel of most factories along the coast were moved to Wuhan, and then moved to the northwest and southwest provinces, and urged to resume production. This work became more urgent in the second half of last year. Factories in Daye, Wuchang, Xiangyang, and Hankou all transported goods diligently amidst the bombing. Important enterprises, such as Huaji Cement Plant, Hanyang Iron and Steel Plant, Yuhua, Shenxin, Zhenhua, and other yarn factories, Lihua, Yuanhua, and other coal mines, all managed to move to other places. As of December 15, a total of 341 private factories and mines have been moved with the assistance of the government, including 142 in Sichuan, 120 in Shaanxi, Guangxi, and Hunan, and 54 in other places. The machinery weighs a total of 65,200 tons, plus the machinery of the Hanyang Iron and Steel Plant and the Liuhegou Iron Smelting Furnace, the machinery transported inward should total more than 120,000 tons. Textile factories account for 30,000 tons, coal mine machinery and hardware and machine factories each account for more than 8,000 tons, electrical equipment factories and ceramic machine materials each account for 3,000 tons, and chemical factory machinery materials account for more than 2,000 tons. Private factories are also assisted by the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office, with loans totaling about 5 million yuan, and loans are used to purchase materials, so that the loans provided for one year of production total about 3.5 million yuan. In order to urge them to resume production as soon as possible, special regulations have been made for resumption of production, divided into temporary resumption, formal resumption, and merger resumption. Based on the nature of various industries, the deadline for resumption of production is specified separately. Those who fail to resume production within the deadline will be warned, and the time for assessment may be appropriately extended. If they still fail to resume production, they may refuse the request for assistance, or adopt methods to utilize those who have some equipment. The government also vigorously encourages important industries that were originally in the interior, such as Lihuang Iron Works, Hunan Zinc Plant, Chongqing Cement Plant, Chongqing Power Plant, Jiading Jiale Paper Mill, Guangxi Sugar Factory, Oil Pressing Factory, Alcohol Factory, etc. Methods have been devised to allocate funds to assist them, or to negotiate with banks, totaling more than 6 million yuan. The assistance to inland mining is also being earnestly promoted. For example, the Tianfu Coal Mine on the banks of the Jialing River has recently increased coal production with the assistance of the government, and the daily output can reach 800 to 1,000 tons, which is three or four times more than before. Nanchuan and Tongzi, which are located at the border of Sichuan and Guizhou, are engaging in the mining of new coal mines. After the project is completed, several hundred tons can be produced daily. Recently, the Jiayang Coal Mine Company has been organized in western Sichuan in cooperation with merchants to mine coal in Jianwei, Leshan, and Pingshan. After the implementation, several hundred tons can also be produced daily.

Supporting Commerce

(3) Commerce: (A) Foreign Trade: Because the Ministry of Finance has established a Trade Commission, it has been transferred to the Commission for handling. However, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is still working hard to plan and promote imports and exports within the scope of its functions. The trade of tungsten and antimony mines is still managed by the Resources Committee, and the value of international exchange of goods is the largest. The Vegetable Oil and Material Plant Company and the Tea Company, which were jointly established by the former Ministry of Industry, are still working hard. (B) Implementing economic severance with Japan: The Draft Regulations on Prohibiting Japanese Goods and the Regulations on Prohibiting the Transportation of Materials to Japan have been drafted and submitted to the National Government for promulgation, so that central and local agencies can jointly promote it within the scope of their respective responsibilities. The transportation of materials to Japan is only occasionally ordered, and now it is planned to plan and implement it thoroughly. Regarding Japanese goods, it is necessary to properly distinguish them from the goods produced in the occupied areas. Those that are indeed confiscated and controlled by the Japanese should be regarded as enemy goods, but other products that are purely operated by Chinese people should still be protected as appropriate so that they can be marketed, so as to avoid falling into the Japanese's plan of isolation. In order to make the distinction appropriate, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide more information about the industrial and commercial situation in various provinces, so that it can be clearly understood. (C) Commercial Management: At present, the prices of various goods in the rear market are often rising sharply. If the price increase is due to the relationship between supply and demand, it is inevitable, but if there are unscrupulous merchants who deliberately hoard and manipulate the market, methods should be devised to punish them and stabilize prices in order to protect the public interest. A Price Evaluation Committee has been established jointly with the relevant agencies and has started work. It is hoped that the local competent authorities will pay attention to and assist in the progress at any time. For important items, such as the supply of , a Fuel Management Office has been established to thoroughly plan and adjust production, transportation, and consumption. Before Wuhan was retreated, the consumption of was very large. On the one hand, the government urged coal mines in Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces to increase production, increasing production by more than 1,000 tons per day. On the other hand, the Management Office prepared operating funds of 200,000 yuan to collect coal produced by local kilns in various places and transport them centrally. Because the railways were very busy for military use, ship transportation was fully utilized to facilitate the supply. From July last year to the withdrawal from Wuhan, more than 200,000 tons of bituminous coal from Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Sichuan, Henan, and other provinces were transported to Wuhan. The use of coal is also planned and controlled, divided into military, boat, public, commercial, and civilian use, saving waste and supplying needs. Although the price is slightly higher than usual due to the relationship between supply and demand and the increasing transportation costs, it is still kept within a reasonable limit, and unscrupulous merchants are strictly prohibited from hoarding and speculating, so that coal users will not be excessively difficult. At present, Hunan Province and the Hunan-Guangxi Railway consume tens of thousands of tons of bituminous coal per month, and Yichang and Shashi consume about 10,000 tons per month, which are being supplied by means. The principle is to supply the needs of the front with the production of the interior. The accumulated production in Sichuan Province is also part of the fuel management work.

Repairing Waterways

(4) Waterway Engineering: Waterway transportation has always been the main route of inland transportation, saving money and being widely distributed. It should be used in conjunction with roads to strive for smooth passage. The projects that have been started are: (A) The Xiang-Gui Waterway, which has been ordered to be organized by the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Committee in cooperation with the Guangxi Provincial Government. The main project is in Lingui County, between Xing'an and Guilin, with a total length of 150 kilometers. The canal section especially needs to be dredged. It is planned to blast rocks, build, and improve steep gates during the low water period, so that ships weighing 7 tons can navigate all year round between Guilin and Guangxi, and small can be used between Guangxi and Wuzhou. Ships weighing 20 can be used all year round. (B) The upper reaches of the Jialing River in Sichuan and Gansu, the Songkan River and the Pupu River, were originally one of the roads in Sichuan and Gansu. The upper reaches also have coal and iron production, but the wooden boats cannot go up due to shallow water, rapid flow, and covered stones, goat hooves, Luxia and other caves. Now, water construction is underway, with and boat locks to make the transportation capacity of the two rivers reach a maximum of 1,200 per day. Personnel from the Daohuai Committee have been assigned to handle it within a time limit. In addition, the Jialing River waterway from Hechuan to , Sichuan, which is about 600 kilometers long, the upper reaches of the Fu River waterway from Mianyang to Pingwu (the lower reaches can carry wooden boats weighing 40 tons), the and between Fuling, which is 200 kilometers long, and the waterway from Sinan, Guizhou, to, the left tributary of the Yu River from Guilin to, Guangxi (after improvement, can make the regularly navigable tons of), the waterway from Longzhou to Nachen, which is 120 li long, the waterway from Guilin to Guiping, which is 100 kilometers long, and the upper reaches of the Qingshui River from, Guishan, to Majiang, Guizhou, The Yuan River waterway from Taoyuan to Yuanling, Hunan, which is about 170 kilometers long (can be connected to small after , and the river that the salt from the salt area in Sichuan (ie, the Zigong area) passes through are all being planned and improved separately. It is planned to implement the project during the low water period, so as to make a before the flood this year.

### Anti-Japanese Stronghold in Southern Mongolia

(Correspondence from Northwestern Shanxi) Taolimin, located in the desert south of Suiyuan, has always been overlooked by us. Some people don't even know that such a piece of land exists. Since the iron heels of Japanese imperialism followed the Ping-Sui Railway line all the way to Baotou, and entrenched themselves in the Hangjin Banner military camp, ravaging our compatriots there, this piece of land has attracted the attention of the Chinese people.

Taolimin is located in the central area of ​​the Yikezhao League and is also the most concentrated area of ​​Han Chinese in the Yimeng area. To the northeast, it can reach Baotou; to the northwest, it can reach Wuyuan; to the southwest, it can reach Anbian and Dingbian. Furthermore, it connects to Ningxia in the west and Yulin in the south. It is a military stronghold that the Japanese must seize in order to invade our Great Northwest.

Taolimin Village was originally within the territory of Otog Banner, but what people generally refer to as Taolimin is the area where Han Chinese live in the Hangjin Banner and Tuotuo Banner area. Like other Mongolian areas, it is entirely a desolate grassland, sparsely inhabited by Mongolians. The Mongolian authorities opened up this wasteland for Han Chinese to rent and cultivate, starting in 1923. Currently, there are more than 3,000 households, totaling over 30,000 Han Chinese, residing in the Taolimin area.

Before the War of Resistance, the political power in this area was entirely in the hands of the Mongolian Banner authorities. The Mongolians were very harsh in their management of the Han Chinese, so the local Han Chinese once requested that the Suiyuan Provincial Government establish a county, hoping to alleviate the oppression of the Mongolians. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the responsible authorities deeply felt the necessity of rapidly establishing administrative unity. Therefore, in the spring of last year, they began to establish a village system in Taolimin, totaling sixteen villages. However, the Mongolian authorities adopted an opposing attitude towards this arrangement. They are now re-establishing administration in the Han Chinese residential areas around Otog Banner, attempting to abolish the village system established by the Han Chinese using the baojia system.

Taolimin has never had local armed forces or stationed troops. For the needs of the War of Resistance, local figures, led by Yue Taoren, received orders from Commander Men to organize a self-defense force in the spring of last year, establishing a total of three major brigades. Later, this caused many misunderstandings, and Commander Men ordered the cessation of activities. Later, the local people sent representatives to Chairman Fu Zuoyi to request that the local armed forces obtain a legitimate status. Currently, they are nominally called the Taolimin Local Security Brigade. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, there have been quite a few troops stationed there, about seven or eight units.

The culture there is very backward. Most of the people are illiterate. In such a large area, only Taolimin Village has a primary school. Although the scale is pitifully small, it can be considered the only educational institution in the desert. Since the government's political work team went there to work, they have successively helped to establish eight primary schools. Most of the teachers are comrades from the Mobilization Committee and the political work team. The curriculum all uses national salvation materials. In particular, the sound of national salvation songs is popularly sung in the desolate wilderness. Each school also provides free night schools for the poor herdsmen.

Most of the Han Chinese there make a living by farming, and animal husbandry also occupies an important position. The cultivated land is about 30,000 hectares. The crops are millet, grain, wheat, yam, hemp, etc. The land relations are quite complicated. There is so-called permanent tenancy, that is, Han Chinese buy the land from the Mongolians. There is so-called active tenancy, renting for several years or one year, among which there are distinctions between directly renting from Mongolians and indirectly renting from Han Chinese. Most of the land is owned by the Mongolians, especially by the Mongolian princes, who hold the majority, and a small part is owned by Han Chinese landlords. The Mongolians there do not believe in fiat currency. Buying and selling transactions require hard currency. The Han Chinese also have the same habit. This is a serious economic problem in the War of Resistance.

With the promotion of various parties, the national salvation work there has been established. First of all, it should be pointed out that the formal establishment of the War Zone Mobilization Committee took place in April of last year. Participants included comrades from the Suiyuan Provincial Government's political work team, comrades from a certain unit of the stationed troops, the local village heads, the self-defense army, and all enthusiastic national salvation figures. Their work area consists of four areas. Within Hangjin Banner, Wuyanjing to Jike Wusu is one area, Jike Wusu to Gaodai is one area, and Otog Banner is also divided into two areas, east and west. Their important work is to organize peasant associations. More than seventy have been organized. In addition to regularly helping with mobilization work, the peasant associations also partially reduce rent and interest to improve people's lives. Due to the lack of cadres, the work of youth salvation and women's salvation is the weakest link in the entire work. In order to train a large number of cadres, they have opened short-term training classes, opening five in total, with training periods ranging from one week to two weeks, training a total of more than 100 cadres. The training courses include political common sense, the united front, and national salvation organization. The most important plan is to open a senior military and political training class with a duration of two months. In addition, they have repeatedly done some work to慰勞 the troops.

In July of last year, they established contact with the Second War Zone War Zone General Mobilization Committee. Under the leadership of the War Zone General Mobilization Committee, undoubtedly, their work has made further progress. Now, a serious problem facing the comrades working in Taolimin is how to reduce the friction between the Han and Mongolian peoples. Originally, the estrangement between the Han and Mongolian peoples was not without historical reasons. However, the main reason was the provocation of the Japanese imperialists, inciting ethnic feelings in order to carry out their plan to control China by using Chinese. In the spring of last year, this even resulted in a tragedy of Mongolians beating Han Chinese. Now, in order to invade the Great Northwest, the Japanese are intensifying their poisonous plan of provocation. The culturally backward Mongolians are easily used by the Japanese. Therefore, doing political work there while holding a great Han chauvinistic view will increase the friction between the Han and Mongolians. Only by using a correct ethnic policy can Mongolian compatriots be organized into the anti-Japanese front. Currently, the important administrative system that the Mongolian authorities want to implement is an attempt to hold power in their own hands. However, the Han Chinese there are unwilling to be managed by the Mongolians. If the two sides continue to confront each other, it will be enough to create a good opportunity for the Japanese to provoke. Therefore, the comrades working in various aspects there believe that it is better to actively help them organize than to passively resist the activities of the Mongolian authorities. However, it is necessary to ensure that: 1. The people responsible for the baojia are elected by the people. 2. The national salvation organizations legally exist and continue to operate. 3. The current people's armed forces must not be abolished and must be guaranteed to expand. This working line is completely correct. Originally, the great Han chauvinism that we carried out aroused the Mongolian compatriots' hatred of the Han Chinese. This is a major obstacle to the unity of the Chinese nation. We must implement Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, seeking equality internally and liberation externally. In fact, only when all ethnic groups in the country strengthen unity on the basis of equality can we seek the liberation of all ethnic groups from foreign aggression!

The working line of Taolimin is completely victorious!

### The Coastal Area of Eastern Zhejiang Under the Harassment of Japanese Warships

(Correspondence from Shanghai) Recently, due to the intrusion of Japanese warships into eastern Zhejiang, the situation has become slightly tense. The Japanese side has also spread rumors, claiming that the Japanese army has landed on a certain important location on the south bank of the Qiantang River a few days ago, causing deep concern among Zhejiang people living abroad. After inquiries from various relevant parties by the reporter, it has been learned that the landing on the Qiantang River is completely untrue. Wenzhou, Ningbo, Haimen, and other places are all as peaceful as usual. There is no news of a blockade at the mouths of the Ou River and Yong River, and navigation is still operating as usual. The situation is recorded as follows:

The Landing on the Qiantang River is Purely a Rumor

A few days ago, there was a widespread rumor that the Japanese army had landed on a certain important location on the south bank of the Qiantang River, causing many Zhejiang people living abroad to be very concerned because it concerns the safety of their homeland. After inquiries by the reporter, the cause of the rumor was due to a news report that "more than ten Japanese warships left the Yangtze River and sailed towards Hangzhou." This caused generally overly sensitive people to speculate wildly. In fact, it was purely the Japanese side spreading rumors, aiming to disrupt the people's morale. A few days ago, all relevant parties in this city inquired by telegram. It was learned that a small group of Japanese troops had landed near the Dongzhou of Fuchun River, namely the sandbar of Zhoujiapu, but after being fiercely attacked by the stationed troops, they were unable to make any progress. As for the Qiantang River, although the Japanese army attempted to cross the river and land, they have not succeeded. Therefore, the previous rumor that they had landed on Xiaoshan is completely untrue. As for Wenzhou, it is true that several Japanese planes went to bomb on the 20th. They first dropped many bombs near the suburbs, mostly falling in the fields. Then they flew to the urban area in the afternoon and bombed, dropping four bombs near the county government. Dozens of houses in the area were destroyed, and the detention center of the county government was also hit by a bomb, killing and injuring more than twenty prisoners. Therefore, the damage was not significant. The shipping industry in this city received a telegram from Wenzhou saying that the situation was peaceful and the shops were open as usual. Furthermore, a certain shipping company telegraphed Ningbo and Haimen to inquire about the situation, and received a reply telegram in the afternoon, also stating that everything was safe. According to correspondence from Wenzhou, a large number of Japanese planes raided this area on the morning of the 21st, dropping bombs in the urban area. A part of the county government buildings were also destroyed by the bombing. As for the casualties of residents, it is not yet clear and the authorities are currently handling the aftermath.

The Mouths of the Yong and Ou Rivers Will Not Be Blockaded

Since Japanese warships have repeatedly harassed various ports in eastern Zhejiang in the past month, our military authorities have taken strict precautions and built fortifications at various key locations, deploying elite troops, ready to respond to any eventuality. Regarding shipping to the south bank, except for Haimen which has been blockaded, Wenzhou and Ningbo have no intention of being blockaded for the time being, as the situation is not yet so severe. However, since the rumor once spread a few days ago, all Zhejiang people living abroad are worried about the blockade of transportation. According to inquiries by the reporter from the shipping industry, the current situation is very safe and the defense of Zhenhai Port is strict. Japanese smoke is used to display prowess, so it is expected that the Ningbo authorities will not implement a blockade unless it is absolutely necessary. As for the mouth of the Ou River, there was originally a rumor of preparations for a blockade, but it can be implemented immediately when necessary.

On the morning of the 21st, a rumor spread in this city that the Shanghai-Ningbo route was no longer open. After inquiries by the reporter, the above rumor was completely untrue. The "Hua An" of the American China Merchant Steam Navigation Company sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai at 5:00 PM on the 20th and arrived in port at 11:00 AM on the 21st. According to the crew, the situation in Ningbo was as usual and there were no changes. They were surprised by the rumors in Shanghai. The ship will still sail to Ningbo at 3:00 PM today. The "Hana" of the German Deutsch-Asiatische Schiffs-Gesellschaft (DAPG), sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai at 4:00 PM on the 21st to load fish and seafood, and will return directly to Shanghai. The "Santo" of the Portuguese Zhengde Company sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the 21st and arrived in port last night. It is also scheduled to sail to Ningbo this afternoon. Therefore, shipping is still smooth and there are no obstacles.

Detailed Account of the Japanese Warships Bombarding Eastern Zhejiang

[Correspondence from Ningbo] Since Zhenhai urban area was bombarded by Japanese warships on the 14th of this month, most of the residents have voluntarily evacuated. Because the authorities are defending properly, although they are constantly harassed by Japanese warships, the residents remaining in Zhenhai are still calm. At about 7:00 AM on the 19th, a Japanese cruiser sailed from Shanghai, followed by three destroyers and two transport ships, gathering in the waters between Qiliyu and Xiegang outside Zhenhai Port. At first, there was no movement. Suddenly, at about 10:00 AM, they opened fire on the shore, indiscriminately bombarding. The garrison troops initially responded calmly, and then bravely fired back. The artillery battle lasted until about 1:00 PM and then ceased. At about 2:00 PM, the Japanese warships suddenly opened fire again, sporadically bombarding. The artillery fire was not as intense as in the morning. Our garrison troops also retaliated. By the time the second artillery battle stopped at 4:00 PM, two Japanese warships had been hit on the side of the ship and retreated with damage. The other four ships remained anchored in their original locations. In total, the artillery battle lasted six hours over five days. Japanese warships fired more than 400 shots, most of which landed on the mountains and sea around Xiaojiang and Qingzhi. A corner of the opera stage in the Xiaojiang Xinggong was destroyed. Two civilian men and two women were injured, all very minor. A hawker selling tin foil ash who was passing by on Sha蟹岭 was killed. His head was separated from his body, which was a very tragic sight. There was slight damage to the houses. The urban area and the cities south of the Yangtze River were not affected. The Jiang Japanese warships once retreated on the morning of the 20th. At about 10:00 AM before noon, they sailed back to their original positions and continued to open fire on the shore. The garrison troops immediately gave them a head-on blow, stopping at about 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The Japanese warships fired a total of 116 shots, all aimlessly. The shells all landed on the coastal beaches and the mountains around Xiaojiang and Qingzhi, without any loss. The Japanese warships knew that it was difficult to succeed because the Chinese army was heavily defended. Therefore, at 5:00 PM in the evening, they all left, and there was no trace of Japanese warships on the sea near Ningbo.

Furthermore, at about 10:00 AM on the 20th, four small Japanese warships sailed to the waters of Zhapu, Hangzhou. At 11:00 AM, they suddenly opened fire on the opposite shore of Yuhang, along the coast of Lingshan, firing a total of four or five shells. They were all shots fired without aim, all of which landed on the beach. We suffered no losses. The warships then sailed northeast. Furthermore, at about 9:00 AM on the morning of the 21st, four Japanese planes were discovered in Taizhou. They intruded into the airspace of Haimen City from the Shujiangkou, circling and flying several times, dropping a few light bombs. There was slight damage to the houses. Since Haimen has been repeatedly bombarded by Japanese planes and warships, the residents have already dispersed, so there were few casualties. The planes then flew to the sea to chase after large merchant ships, and strafed them with machine guns, injuring one tea servant inside the ship. They finally fled overseas at about 10:00 AM. When the Japanese planes were bombing Haimen, Eastern Zhejiang counties, Zhenhai, Fenghua, Ninghai, Linhai, Huangyan, and other counties all issued alerts to be prepared. The alerts were lifted only after the Japanese planes fled.

### Heavy Losses for the Japanese in Northern Jiangxi; Fierce Street Battles Once Took Place in Nanchang; Our Cover Troops Heroically Killed the Japanese

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 28th] The Japanese invading from Fengxin are currently in fierce combat with our army near Dacheng. The Japanese have not made any progress in recent days.

[Central News Agency, Gaoan, 28th] Yesterday morning, our troops launched a fierce attack on Anyi. The Japanese resisted strongly. After our army advanced wave upon wave, fighting bloody battles, by noon, all the Japanese strongholds in the northwest of Anyi, such as Zhoujiashan, Fenghuangshan, Hushan, and Chenjiashan, were recovered. The Japanese suffered extremely heavy casualties and dispersed towards Anyi and Gaoan. Our troops are advancing towards Anyi City.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 28th] More than a thousand Japanese soldiers and artillerymen advanced towards the vicinity of the Sanbian-Jingzhong road yesterday morning. Our army bravely resisted, braving the poison gas. After five hours of fierce fighting, more than 400 Japanese were killed. The Japanese finally collapsed and retreated towards Muyu Mountain.

[Central News Agency, Wuning, 28th] The Japanese who claimed to occupy Ruoxi recently invaded Wuning. After our army's continuous and fierce attacks, they suffered heavy casualties. Our army took the opportunity to recover important places such as Huangpugang, Danaojian, Bai Lao, Huijiashan, Wangrennao, Jinzhongshan, and Fenghuangjian. The Japanese repeatedly sent reinforcements to invade, combining machine guns and artillery to attack, and also used a large number of poison gas bombs. Our officers and soldiers resisted the poison and fought bravely, killing countless Japanese. Our position remained unmoved. Fierce fighting is still ongoing.

[Local News] According to Western news reports, Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province, unfortunately fell into Japanese hands at 6:40 PM on the 27th. There was a bloody battle for 96 hours before the fall, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. This is enough to prove the heroic and fierce resistance of our army before the withdrawal. The Japanese side also admitted to their significant casualties in the communique, but refused to announce the numbers, only stating that the Chinese army had 3,700 dead and 770 captured in one day. If so, then the casualties of the Japanese, who were on the offensive, must be far greater than this number. The Chinese troops defending the Nanchang area were the 3rd Division, the 216th Division, the 53rd Division, and the 77th Division. The most moving event in the entire Nanchang battle was the destruction of the Zhongzheng Bridge to stop the Japanese advance. A squad of brave Chinese soldiers secretly guarded a small bunker outside the city gate. Some used machine guns to shoot towards the bridge, while others buried explosives in the bridge. The Japanese repeatedly tried to cross the bridge, but were repeatedly forced back by Chinese machine guns. Finally, the Japanese used tanks to charge. The brave squad of Chinese soldiers heroically sacrificed themselves under the artillery fire. However, the Japanese tank convoy also sank to the bottom of the river halfway across the bridge due to the explosion of the explosives, and the bridge was interrupted. The destruction of the Zhongzheng Bridge blocked the Japanese north of the Gan River for up to ten hours. Therefore, after the railway station fell at 10:00 AM on the 27th, the Japanese only managed to break into Nanchang at 6:40 PM that afternoon.

Our Army Approaches Xinyang

[Central News Agency, Nanyang, 27th] A telephone call from Tongbai on the 27th morning stated that a unit of our army advanced towards Erdaohe on the 24th and 25th, made contact with the Japanese, and a fierce battle broke out. Many Japanese soldiers were killed on the spot, and two machine guns were captured. Our army also suffered some casualties. Another unit of our army recovered Luotuodian, Youhedian, and Chushandian on the 24th. Many Japanese were killed at that time, and they took advantage of the victory to pursue them. They have now pursued to the vicinity of Zaolinggangpo in the suburbs of Xinyang City. The Japanese in the city are extremely panicked.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 28th] At dawn on the 24th, a unit of our army attacked the Japanese on the eastern ridge of Tongguan Road. After several hours of fierce fighting, the commander of the Japanese Migang unit was wounded in the arm by a bullet.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 26th] Ma Zixi, commander of the Yimeng Darat Banner, recently came to Guilin from the front. According to him, Yimeng is peaceful. The Japanese and us are facing each other on the beaches of Baotou, and there has been no action recently.

The Japanese Are On The Move Again In Southern Guangdong

[Reuters, 28th] On the 27th, Japanese troops advanced towards Zhongshan and engaged in a fierce battle with Chinese guerrillas all day. They captured Rongqi and Guizhou. Currently, Chinese troops are still confronting the Japanese. It is reported that since the weekend, 12,000 Japanese troops have landed in Humen.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 28th] The fighting on the Huaxian-Zengcong lines is calm, and there are no major changes in the Japanese situation. However, the Japanese army is very busy transporting supplies from Guangzhou to Sanshui in recent days.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 28th] More than a thousand Japanese troops in Huangsha recently moved to the Jiangcun area, seemingly intending to invade Huaxian.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 28th] On the morning of the 22nd, more than 400 Japanese troops, together with the Japanese troops in Shawan (East Liudong), invaded us. A unit of our division engaged in a fierce battle with them near Guanshan until noon. More than 300 Japanese troops on Wangjiang Mountain attacked our Yanglongshan position. Our defending soldiers fought them in hand-to-hand combat. In the end, due to the enemy's superiority in numbers, we retreated to the Lijiasaka. Fierce fighting is still ongoing on all fronts.

[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 27th] A unit of our army attacked the Japanese east of Nanlinqiao on the night of the 26th, seizing many rifles and other military supplies, and destroying the Japanese camp.

"Central News Agency, Yicheng, 28th" The Japanese in Zhongxiang, Jiudian and other places frequently move back and forth to confuse people. In the past two days, the Japanese have only sent a reconnaissance plane to reconnoiter the Xiang River area, and there have been no other movements.

### Under the New Japanese Offensive: The Recent Situation in Northern Jiangxi; The Japanese Used Up to Five Divisions; Sacrificing 15,000 Men Was Not Worth the Losses

[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 27th] The Northern Jiangxi war situation, which had been calm for four months, suddenly turned tense. In the past month, the Japanese have been reinforcing troops on the Nanchang front, and the numbers that have been discovered amount to as many as four divisions. The Japanese must have new plans in that direction. Because of this, the reporter recently crossed Mount Mufu, passed through Wuning, and rushed to the Xiushui front line to inspect. Along the way, wheat seedlings are as green as blankets, willow branches hang low, and hundreds of flowers are waiting to bloom. It is truly a time when spring returns to the earth. After four months of reorganization, our army should have new vitality. Xiushui, also known as Xijiang, is 500 miles long. Wucheng, north across the lake, and Xingzi and Duchang serve as distant outposts, serving as the inner gateway to Poyang Lake. Although Xingzi was lost last year, Poyang Lake is still under our control because Duchang and Wuning are still in our hands.

The Prelude to the Battle of Duchang

On the 13th of the month, the Japanese, with two planes providing cover, sent three or four hundred troops to attack Pingfeng Mountain, 27 kilometers northwest of Duchang. At dawn on the 14th, they again sent three ships and nine boats, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, and landed on Laodongmiao Dashishan, about three kilometers west of Duchang, opposite Xingzi City. In total, the Japanese occupied Dashishan three times, and all three times they were driven back by our brave counterattacks. The intensity of the fighting and the magnitude of the sacrifices were unprecedented. General Wang, who commanded our army's operations on that front, composed a seven-character poem when he recovered Dashishan on the 17th, containing the quick line "Tens of thousands of troops are victorious, Wang Lang snatches back the elder sister" (elder sister and Dashishan have the same sound, used here as a metaphor). The Japanese's fantasy of invading Duchang has been completely shattered by us.

Defeating the Japanese at Wucheng

After failing to invade Duchang, the Japanese shifted their forces to harass our Wucheng. Counting from the morning of the 17th, every day they used more than 20 ships and 30 to 40 speedboats, under the crazy bombing cover of Japanese planes, attempting to forcibly land at Wucheng in order to achieve their goal of controlling Poyang Lake, Xiushui, and the Gan River. After such a fierce attack for three days, what the Japanese gained was the sinking of one warship and more than ten speedboats, and the casualties of four or five hundred officers and soldiers. They gained nothing else.

Breakthrough on the Xiushui River

The Japanese's operations of avoiding the strong and attacking the weak has always been their consistent style. After this, in addition to continuing to try to land at Songmenshan Hexilong and other places east of Wucheng with ships and boats, they also transferred their main force to the Yongxiu Qiujin area on the north bank of the Xiushui River to prepare for crossing the river. They also sent a portion of troops from Ruoxi in two routes, one westward and one southward, to block our left-wing troops from going east and attacking their flanks. In the afternoon of the 21st, the Japanese used some kind of relationship to cross the Xiushui River southeast of Qiujin, passing through Gouziling and Xiongliuzhuang and going straight to Tanxi along the highway. After our resistance, they failed to move south.

Struggle for Fengxin

On the morning of the 22nd, under the cover of artillery, the Japanese set up pontoon bridges between Zhanggongdu and Qiujin. At the same time, a unit of infantry covered 20 to 30 tanks and more than ten armored vehicles, and crossed the river south in a big way. They were also equipped with balloons rising high in the air to indicate the direction of artillery fire. Our front-line troops were still able to fight bloody battles under the combined fierce attack of the Japanese land and air forces. Therefore, until the 23rd, the Japanese, who invaded south along the Tanxi Highway, although they occupied Anyi, in the Battle of Mantoushan north of the city, most of the more than 2,000 men of the Japanese Fan Ye Regiment became what the Japanese called a "silent triumph". On the same day, another unit of the Japanese, from Tanxi via the ancient road, passed through Long'anqiao Baitianpu, and from Anyi Jing'an between Qianzhou and Fengxin, happened to be overtaken by a new force of our army and were all repulsed. On the 24th, the Japanese attacked Jing'an with one part of their forces, and Fengxin with their main force. After our army easily obtained the glorious battle result of killing more than 2,000 Japanese officers and soldiers, including another regimental commander, Guanzaki, we began to abandon our defense.

Withdrawal from Wucheng

At this time, on the Wucheng side of our right wing, the Japanese landed at Songmenshan Hexi and Yejiazhou one after another, advancing towards our Wucheng Town in different directions. The town had been under crazy bombardment by the Japanese naval, land, and air artillery for a week, and all 20,000 houses in the town (Wucheng is one of the four major towns in Jiangxi Province) were reduced to scorched earth. All fortifications were almost completely destroyed. However, the loyal and brave XX Second Regiment of our army, after suffering heavy casualties, still used broken walls as cover and calmly resisted. Only on the 24th did they receive orders to join the Tu Jiabu and Wan Jiabu troops and retreat to the Feng'an Changbu Street line.

Gaoan in Dire Straits

On the 25th, the Japanese from the Fengxin and Anyi routes attacked Gaoan, Nanchang, and Lehua at the same time. Invading south towards Gaoan, their aim was to cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and then sweep towards both wings. They have been blocked by a certain loyal army of ours in front of Dacheng Village Qianjie. At this point, the Japanese turned east and joined the forces from Lehua moving south to spy on Nanchang. An unprecedented fierce battle since the Wuhan campaign suddenly and rapidly unfolded in the Gan River delta.

Street Fighting in Nanchang

After releasing a large amount of poison gas in the afternoon of the 26th, the Japanese attempted to forcibly cross the Gan River at Shengmi Street and launch a surprise attack on the flanks of Nanchang. As of the time the reporter was writing, our troops in Nanchang were using every street and alley as trenches and every house as a mountain fortress, engaging in fierce street battles with the Japanese.

A Summary

In summary, although this Japanese invasion of Nanchang has not lasted for half a month, the numbers of troop formations that have been discovered amount to five divisions. In addition to the naval landing forces, the actual number should be more than three divisions. The severity of the casualties totals more than 15,000 men. This is comparable to the Battle of Luxembourg during the European War in the Japanese's broadcasts, which was by no means what they had expected. The implication is that they have suffered the pain of gaining less than they lost. As for the upper reaches of the Xiushui River, in the Wuning area, our army's counterattacks have repeatedly achieved results. The Japanese on the Hunan-Jiangxi Highway have been unable to make further progress. Furthermore, the isolated army on Mount Lu is launching attacks from time to time, and there is a possibility that the rear of the Japanese bandits will be cut off.

### League of Nations Technicians Assist China in Epidemic Prevention; Concrete Plans Already in Place

[Chungking, 28th (Central News Agency)] Following the arrival in Chongqing of the League of Nations Epidemic Prevention Committee and its chief technicians Messrs. Mass, Dahl, Robertson, and Yeh Mo, meetings have been held continuously at the Ministry of Health.

### Yunnan Province Holds Fire Drill

[Kunming, 27th, 11:32 PM (Special Dispatch from This Newspaper)] This afternoon, Long Yun convened over two thousand members of the provincial fire brigade for inspection and held a fire drill. The situation was very realistic.

### Shanghai's Wounded Soldier Hospitals Overflow; Many Young Wounded Soldiers Are Anti-War, Homesick, and Often Cry

[Chungking, 27th (Central News Agency)] The wounded soldier hospitals in Shanghai had originally been benefiting from being full of patients. Since the intensification of the war in Central China, wounded soldiers have been continuously transported from the Yangtze River to Shanghai. Because the hospitals can no longer accommodate them, the Hongkou Gongda Cotton Mill, originally used for storing munitions materials, has also been converted into a wounded soldier hospital. Most of the newly arrived wounded soldiers are below the age of conscription and cannot bear the pain. Therefore, anti-war sentiments are very strong, and homesickness is particularly acute, causing them to often cry loudly, leading to exceptionally chaotic order.

### Mass Recruitment of New Party Members; Central Government Strictly Orders All Levels of Party Headquarters

[Chungking, 27th (Central News Agency)] The Central Government, believing that the time has come to advance both the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, urgently needs to recruit talented people from all walks of life to jointly join the Party, uphold the Three Principles of the People, and strive for revolution to achieve the major mission of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. This intention was solemnly declared in the declaration of the Provisional National Congress last year. Subsequently, measures for recruiting party members and ratios of recruitment quantity and quality were successively promulgated. Recently, a telegram was sent to party headquarters in all provinces and cities, strictly ordering them to carry out the measures effectively and instructing them to report on the progress of recruitment once a month.

### A Japanese Resident Assassinated in Yangshupu, Shanghai; The Deceased, Makino, Was an Employee of a Cotton Spinning Company; Subsequent Martial Law and Search North of the Suzhou Creek

[Reuters, Shanghai, 28th] At 7:40 this morning, Makino, a Japanese employee and deputy director of the Chinese staff department of the Shanghai Cotton Textile Association, was shot while riding in a rickshaw in Yangshupu. He was taken to the Japanese military headquarters by Japanese military police and then transferred to the Sanatorium of the Shanghai Cotton Textile Company, where he died of his injuries. Following this incident, the Japanese authorities immediately ordered a temporary suspension of traffic in and out of the Yangshupu district and implemented a strict search. Many Japanese naval marines and military police officers went to the scene of the incident to investigate and detained several Chinese for questioning. One bullet casing is the only clue. The occurrence of this case in an area heavily patrolled by the Japanese military is rare. Additionally, the Japanese authorities arrested a suspect near the scene of the incident.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 28th] Makino, a leading figure in the local Japanese Residents Association, was shot in Yangshupu today and has been taken to a hospital for treatment. His injuries are very serious. The assailant escaped. Japanese military police and concession police are jointly investigating the incident. At the same time, bridges leading to Japanese-occupied areas are being strictly searched, greatly affecting traffic.

### Japanese Act Brazenly in Shanghai; Openly Launch Anti-British Campaign; Japanese Puppet Newspapers Prominently Display Anti-British Slogans, Attempting to Exclude British Interests in China

[Reuters, Shanghai, 28th] The various Chinese-language newspapers published by the Japanese here are now beginning a fierce anti-British campaign. On the front pages of the newspapers, they compete to publish slogans in large characters, such as "Tear Down the British Flag," "Boycott British Goods," "Confiscate British Property," and "Expel the British from the Country." An American churchman from Nanjing said that the Japanese-run newspapers in Nanjing are also advocating that anyone employed by the British, including consular employees, should resign and cease serving.

[Hong Kong News] The Hong Kong *SMC Post* yesterday published a bundle of foreign news, claiming that the Chinese newspapers published by the Japanese in Shanghai have begun a fierce anti-British movement. The front pages of the newspapers prominently display anti-British slogans in large characters, such as "Tear Down the British Flag," "Boycott British Goods," "Confiscate British Property," and "Expel the British from the Country," which is extremely absurd and infuriating. At the same time, an American missionary told a foreign reporter that this kind of anti-British movement by the Japanese is being carried out fiercely in the occupied areas of China, and they are also promoting the recovery of British concessions in China, *[illegible]* completely handing them over to the puppet organizations under Japanese control. All British rights and interests in China will also be completely abolished. Even British ships sailing to various ports in China must be stopped. Since the fall of Hainan Island, the Japanese have been constantly provoking the British. The recent bombing of Kowloon and Luohu by Japanese aircraft was a prelude to the Japanese attempt to recover the British concessions in China. It was also a step in the Japanese probing the British. Past incidents, such as the killing of British missionaries by the Japanese army in Pingjiang last year, the bombing of a British church in Zhengzhou, and the arrest of British businessman Mr. Dover in Tianjin, were warnings to the British. "*[illegible]*, "this kind of declaration was issued in Shanghai by a politician from Tokyo. Some even said, "On the one hand, we are blockading the Chinese coast to prevent the British from transporting military supplies to China. We believe that our ability to control this may gradually eliminate Hong Kong." Such preposterous and absurd claims exist.

### British Upper House Member Expresses Sympathy for China; Exchange Equalization Fund Bill Passes Second Reading; Members Praise China's Sound Finances

Lord Danmoor stated that China's finances have always been sound and enjoy an outstanding reputation. Lord Snell, speaking on behalf of the Labor Party, said that it was gratifying that Britain was finally able to show its support for China.

### Chen Jie Speaks at a Banquet in Berlin; Expresses Deep Hope for Continued Sino-German Friendship

[Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency)] Last night, the Chinese Students Association in Germany and the German-Dada East Asia Association jointly hosted a banquet. Those present included Chen Jie, the Chinese Ambassador to Germany, Dr. Deppmüller, the German Minister of Transport, General von Kressenstein, the former German advisor to China, Dr. Hachnel, advisor to the German Propaganda Ministry, Major General Kreipel, the former German Consul in Shanghai, members of the Chinese Students Association, representatives of the German government, army generals, and prominent figures from industry and finance. At the banquet, the head of the Chinese Students Association and German Navy Captain Lissman gave speeches, stating that although Ambassador Chen had only been in Germany for a short time, those in charge of promoting friendship between China and Germany all considered the Ambassador to be the most suitable person. If the people of both countries can be friendly, the communication of culture and the development of trade will naturally follow. Even though war clouds are gathering at this time, there is no need for vigilance. Ambassador Chen first thanked the hosts for their hospitality and then said that after listening to Captain Lissman's encouraging words, he hoped that the German people could sympathize with China during its struggle and that the two countries could unite culturally and commercially.

### Wartime Western Railway Construction

— Bi Cen

[Special Airmail Report from Kunming] Transportation is the lifeblood of a country, and railways are one of the most important modern means of transportation. As far as we know today, only railways can undertake the missions of "speed," "heavy burden," and "long distance." Therefore, since the National Government moved to Chongqing, it has been actively planning and constructing the two major railway networks in the Southwest and Northwest, aiming to open up international transportation and serve as the backbone for developing the resources of the Southwest and Northwest. In the Southwest, in addition to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Gejiu-Bisezhai Railway, there are:

(1) The Xukun Railway, from Xuzhou in Sichuan to Kunming in Yunnan, is approximately 774 kilometers long. The construction of this railway was originally planned at the end of the Qing Dynasty, but it was not realized due to various reasons. It was not until September 21 two years ago that the order was given to start organizing preparations. On December 25 last year, a groundbreaking ceremony was held in Kunming. At that time, the reconnaissance work for the entire line had been completed, the preliminary survey work had reached 30%, and the alignment work had reached 15%. By now, the preliminary survey and alignment work will be completed soon. It is estimated that the railway can be completed and opened to traffic within two years.

(2) The Yunnan-Burma Railway, from Kunming in Yunnan, passing through Zhennan, Mengxian, etc., to Nandali on the border between Yunnan and Burma, is 773 kilometers long. In June two years ago, the Ministry of Communications ordered preparations. In July, the survey team set off for surveying, and on August 22, it was officially established in Kunming. On December 25 last year, a groundbreaking ceremony was held in Kunming jointly with the Xukun Railway. The preliminary survey work has reached 45%, and the alignment work has reached 35%. It can also be completed in two years. The construction of the Yunnan-Burma and Xukun Railways requires a total of 200 million National Currency and 2 million pounds of materials, entirely invested by the central and Sichuan-Yunnan provincial governments. This does not mean that foreign investment is not wanted, but that the government wants to implement "self-reliance." Two years later, when the two railways are completed, they are planned to connect in Kunming and will undoubtedly become the main transportation artery between the Yangtze River and the Indian Ocean. At the same time, they will also be the "main artery" for military transportation during the long-term War of Resistance.

(3) The Chengyu Railway, from Chengdu to Chongqing, was originally the western section of the Sichuan-Han Railway. After the failure of the Sichuan-Han Railway, it was shelved for more than 20 years. In March of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], the Ministry of Railways, in accordance with the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session, first prepared to build the Chengyu Railway, dividing it into eight survey teams. It is approximately 523 kilometers long and requires 50 million yuan. Construction started in March two years ago and is expected to be completed and opened to traffic this spring.

(4) The Xiang-Gui Railway, from Hengyang Station on the Yue-Han Railway, passes through Guilin, Liuzhou, Yongning, Longzhou, and Zhennanguan on the border between Guangxi and Vietnam, connecting with a branch line of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The entire line is 950 kilometers long and is divided into four sections for construction. The first section, from Hengyang to Guilin, is 160 kilometers long and requires 26 million yuan. After one and a half years of work, it was officially opened to traffic on September 27 last year, and is jointly operated by the Yue-Han Railway via Zhuzhou and the Zhe-Gan Railway. The second section is from Guilin to Liuzhou, the third section is from Liuzhou to Yongning, and the fourth section is from Yongning to Zhennanguan. The roadbed for these three sections has been completed and is expected to be fully opened to traffic this winter.

(5) The Xiangqian Railway, from Zhuzhou Station on the Yue-Han Railway to Guiyang in Guizhou, the Xiangqian Railway Engineering Bureau was established in June of the 25th year of the Republic [1936]. The section from Zhuzhou via Xiangtan to Xiangxiang has now been completed.

(6) The Dianqian Railway, from Kunming to Guiyang, is 750 kilometers long. The survey work has been completed, and it will be connected to the Xiangqian Railway in the future.

(7) The Guiqian Railway, from Guiyang to Liuzhou, connects to the Xiang-Gui Railway in the south, is 800 kilometers long.

(8) The Chuanqian Railway, from Chongqing to Guiyang, is 600 kilometers long and is a joint venture between China and France.

(9) The Chuan-Kang Railway, from Chengdu in Sichuan to Kangding in Xikang (i.e., Dajianlu), is approximately 200 kilometers long.

In addition, in the Northwest, in addition to the Tongguan-Xi'an section of the Longhai Railway, as well as the Xi'an-Baoji section, which were completed in the Republic of China, and those currently being planned and constructed, there are also:

(1) The Ku-Lun to Verkhneudinsk Railway, going north from Ku-Lun in Mongolia, passing through Bayan, Iro, Chak, and reaching Verkhneudinsk in the Soviet Union, connecting with the Siberian Grand Railway of the Soviet Union. It has now been completed.

(2) The Bao-Lan section of the Longhai Railway, from Baoji via Tianshui to Lanzhou in Gansu, is approximately 400 kilometers long. The Tian-Bao section (from Baoji to Tianshui) has been surveyed and is currently under construction.

(3) The Longxin Railway, from Lanzhou in Gansu, divides into two branches, north and south, after passing through Dingxi and entering Xinjiang. The southern branch is the Shulan Railway, from Gaolan via Anxi directly to Shule in Xinjiang, connecting with Andijan in Soviet Turkestan, and connecting with Iran and Afghanistan, which have the richest oil production. At the same time, the branch line passes through the southern route of the Tianshan Mountains, which is also the richest area of oil mineral deposits in China. Once completed in the future, the supply of oil in China will definitely be satisfactorily resolved. The northern branch is the Yilan Railway, from Lanzhou via Anxi to the northwest into Xinjiang, then passing through Hami and Dihua to reach Yili. Once completed in the future, it can also be connected to the Western Turkestan Railway, forming the most convenient transportation line between China and northern Europe.

(4) The Baoning Railway, from Baotou in Suiyuan to Ningxia in Ningxia Province, is approximately 800 kilometers long and connects with the Ping-Sui Railway. Unfortunately, it has not been planned for construction due to the enemy occupation of the Ping-Sui Railway.

(5) The Bao-Cheng Railway, from Baoji Station on the Longhai Railway, goes south through Nanzheng, Ningqiang, and reaches Chengdu in Sichuan, is approximately 500 kilometers long and requires 50 million yuan. Because this is the main communication line of the two major railway networks in the Southwest and Northwest, its economic and military value is very significant, so it was decided to build it first. In the autumn of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], a team was sent to survey, preparing to cooperate with the Belgian Banking Group for investment. Now it has already begun construction and is being developed.

### A New Path for Guangdong Politics (1)

— Li Yuzhong

Special Correspondence from Shaoguan

Recently, a discussion forum on "How to Rejuvenate Guangdong Politics" was held in Qujiang. It lasted for five evenings and involved heated discussions, resulting in positive outcomes. Such large-scale discussions, especially when Guangzhou had been lost and the situation was somewhat stabilized, providing an opportunity to review and plan ahead, were highly necessary. Participants came from all walks of life, especially patriotic youths, military personnel, and political instructors. Everyone was able to speak their minds freely without any reservations. The conclusions can be considered a concrete expression of Guangdong public opinion. The following is an excerpt of the various opinions, which can greatly assist in the future political reform of Guangdong:

A. Review of Guangdong's Past Politics

1. Is the administrative structure rational?

Whether it is rational or not is not reflected in the administrative system chart or the list of administrative personnel; it is the organizational structure that implements the people's administration. Guangdong's political structure, like the national political structure, still has many irrational aspects. The progress includes: (1) The united front is relatively solid; (2) The authorities are quite capable of mobilizing the people to participate in the War of Resistance, as evidenced by the continuous transportation of troops to the front lines and the establishment and expansion of the self-defense corps; (3) Social order is improving day by day with the War of Resistance, as evidenced by the decrease in banditry; (4) Transportation administration has been quite flexible, as evidenced by the repeated repairs of the bombed railways, with transportation unaffected. Irrational aspects include: (1) Work is not practical, and everything remains on paper; (2) Cannot be simplified, and because it cannot be simplified, it cannot be swift. The division of powers and responsibilities is unclear, so it cannot have the effect of overall planning in supervision, and objectively, it increases the burden on the people. For example, there are national military training, draftee teams, self-defense corps, and volunteer police, all of which are mobilizing the people; (3) Does not follow the principle of division of labor, with many concurrent positions, and does not use specialized talents, but is centered on individual political systems, with no specialized responsibilities to speak of; (4) Popular opinion institutions have not yet been established, leading to the continued existence of corruption, rampant smuggling, the inability of lower levels to reach the upper levels, the inability of upper levels to lead lower levels, and the formation of unrelated departments; (5) Administrative leaders cannot democratize internally, with all powers concentrated in the responsible officials, without discussion forums, review meetings, and subordinates having no way to express their opinions. In terms of finance, there is no public disclosure; (6) Administrative leaders cannot democratize externally, but instead make the people afraid, and lower-level civil servants are even more like wolves and tigers; (7) The bureaucratic atmosphere is too heavy, turning the administrative structure into a bureaucratic machine, busy with welcoming and sending off; (8) The history of policies changes too much, "policies and people differ, people and policies differ," wasting human and material resources; (9) Lower-level institutions are unsound, with Baojia chiefs mostly being local tyrants, who are already opposed to the people. The government's well-intentioned instructions, falling into the hands of the Baojia chiefs, become a hemp rope and iron chain, and also an opportunity for the Baojia chiefs to make money; (10) Educational administration cannot meet the objective requirements, and education in large, medium, and small schools remains the same as in peacetime, stuck in the stage of "the teacher speaks, the student listens," so that when Guangzhou fell, the entire province's education was immediately paralyzed, and the vast number of farmers have very few opportunities to receive War of Resistance education.

2. Has political mobilization been widespread?

Since the War of Resistance, Guangdong's political mobilization has made much progress, but there are still many shortcomings. First, the good aspects: (1) A large number of troops have been dispatched to participate in the War of Resistance, with glorious achievements in Jinghu, Nanxun, and Longhai; (2) Popular armed organizations and military training are quite widespread, such as the establishment of self-defense corps and all training classes, which are always produced in coordination with the War of Resistance. Although the quality is poor, the quantity is considerable; (3) The authorities are relatively enlightened, and general popular organizations are quite active, especially youth and student groups; (4) Speech, publication, assembly, and association can obtain great freedom, such as newspapers, magazines, lectures, and discussion forums, which are rarely banned; (5) The establishment of the Mobilization Committee, although established hastily and not yet fully utilized, has temporarily established many wartime work teams that have done a lot of wartime work. The bad aspects: (1) Not widespread, the vast majority of people have not yet been publicized and organized, there is a disconnect between talents, cadres are panicked, public bond sales are not good, conscription has abuses, traitors are active everywhere, the effort to win international assistance is very inadequate, international publicity is also very little, and the work of winning over and disintegrating puppet troops is greatly neglected; (2) Mobilization is superficial. At most, it can only mobilize a portion of intellectuals. Even the hundreds of thousands of workers in Guangzhou have not been properly mobilized, resulting in a large number of traitors, loose self-discipline, causing a large number of escapes, insufficient cooperation between the military and civilians, and a lack of political education; (3) Not balanced, every intellectual circles in the city, feeling lonely away from the city. There are several reasons why political mobilization is not widespread: (1) No preparation before the War of Resistance, and unable to grasp the most appropriate methods after the war, the Mobilization Committee could not be established early and universally, but was created simply in the tense war situation, and did not include various parties, factions, strata, and occupational groups; (2) The mobilization method is top-down, not bottom-up. The administrative head sees the work of mobilizing the people too simply, thinking that a paper document and an order will do, which is wrong. Otherwise, it is coercion; (3) The general leadership organs are unsound, and the functions of the same agencies mobilizing the people are not clearly divided; (4) Political mobilization only remains in the propaganda stage, and the propaganda is not popular, widespread, and in-depth, and the mobility is too great; (5) The political training work of the army is brittle; for example, in a battalion, there is only one political instructor, and the number is too small.

### Anglo-Soviet Relations Drawing Closer; Foundation for Cooperation Established; Negotiations to Continue in London

[Moscow, 28th (Reuters)] A communiqué here states that negotiations between British Secretary for Overseas Trade, Mr. Hudson, and Soviet officials, will undoubtedly assist in promoting the unity of Anglo-Soviet relations and international cooperation for the benefit of world peace.

[Moscow, 28th (Central News Agency)] A Soviet official statement regarding the Soviet-British trade agreement negotiations states that the negotiations between the two countries will bring Soviet-British relations closer together and will enhance the international forces for maintaining peace.

[Moscow, 28th (Central News Agency)] British Secretary for Overseas Trade, Mr. Hudson, continued talks with Soviet authorities yesterday. A communiqué was issued after the meeting, stating that Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations would be moved to London to continue. The exchange of views on the international situation has established a foundation for cooperation between the two countries on international events.

[Moscow, 27th (Reuters)] The course of negotiations between the Soviet side and British Secretary for Overseas Trade, Mr. Hudson, was announced here, stating that the foundation for trade negotiations between the two countries has been established to continue in London in the future. At the same time, opinions were exchanged on the international situation, and personal contacts have been established to seek mutual cooperation on international events.

### British House of Commons Debates International Situation; Conscription Likely to Be Implemented

[London, 27th (Reuters)] In the British House of Commons today, someone asked what steps the government would take to expand the British Army, given the deteriorating international situation. Under-Secretary of State for War, Mr. Hore-Belisha, replied that the needs of the current situation were under consideration. Someone also asked Mr. Chamberlain what changes had been made to the defense plan. Mr. Chamberlain also replied that it was under consideration.

[London, 27th (Reuters)] In the British House of Commons today, someone asked whether the government could guarantee that it was not planning any economic measures against Germany, given the recent changes in the international situation, which required the government to re-examine the situation. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Butler, replied "Yes." Someone also asked whether the German government's claim that Britain wanted to use economic methods to starve Germany could be included in the country's German-language broadcasts. He replied that this would be considered. He also replied to other questions, stating that the British government had not protested over the Memel affair.

[London, 27th (Reuters)] Reuters has learned that parliamentary sources do not attach importance to the rumors that the government's opinions are divided. Talks on the anti-aggression declaration are continuing. The cabinet's opinion on this matter is absolutely supportive of the Prime Minister. As for the issue of conscription, Britain has not yet guaranteed implementation to France, and there is no disharmony in the cabinet on this issue. The most pressing issue to consider is the national voluntary registration that will begin at the end of March, the results of which will inevitably lead to new developments, and there is a possibility of a plan to force young people to participate in physical training. Ministers intend to experiment with various national organizations to accommodate the Prime Minister's wishes, so that conscription is not implemented during peacetime.

[London, 27th (Haitong News Agency)] The British government's Privy Council is scheduled to meet this Thursday, and the King will personally preside over it. This has attracted the attention of all parties here. The general opinion is that this is a sign that the government will adopt conscription. The cabinet's opinion is believed to be unanimous, with most members supporting the adoption of conscription. However, the Prime Minister still insists on opposing it. Another major opponent is Sir John Simon, who is said to have expressed his willingness to resign rather than support it. It is recalled that in 1914, when Sir John Simon was Home Secretary, he resigned in opposition to conscription. However, it is generally believed that the cabinet may be reorganized to replace some members in preparation for the adoption of conscription.

### Polish Secret Military Buildup Increases Border Defenses; Decides to Issue Bonds to Expand Air Force; Disputes Erupt Between Germany and Poland in the Polish Corridor

[Reuters, Warsaw, 28th] General Skwarczyński, leader of the government party, today called on the nation to generously donate to the 48 million pound national defense bonds. He stated that Poland recognizes that future wars will be the "area of success for the invincible Polish army." Poles are calm about the historical events occurring on their borders, confident in their strong capabilities.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 17th] The Council of State recently decided today to issue bonds to expand the air force and promote air defense. The total amount of debt is yet to be determined. The bonds are divided into two types: one with a face value of 100 złoty (Polish currency), with a weekly interest rate of 5%, and the other with a face value of 20 złoty, with a weekly interest rate of 3%. Issuance is scheduled to begin on the 5th of next month for a period of one month, with General Rudnicki overseeing the matter.

[Associated Press, Danzig, 27th] Reliable sources claim that Poland has secretly concentrated a large army near Danzig to strengthen border defenses. Polish troops have also gathered north of Danzig to prevent German military attempts to invade Danzig. German newspapers have apparently been pressuring Poland over the Danzig issue. Simultaneously, German military officials have also accused the Polish Corridor of being a center for anti-German sentiment, believing that Polish groups are systematically undermining German-Polish relations. A German official news agency reported that German women and children in the Polish Corridor have repeatedly been attacked. Both German and Polish governments have denied that armies are active in the Polish Corridor. The German government has resolutely denied that Germany will attempt anything against Danzig or the Polish Corridor in the near future. The Polish government has also denied mistreating the German minority in the Polish Corridor, and stated that if the Polish border is threatened, Poland will resolutely resist.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 27th] "Paris Evening News" reported tonight that the Polish government has recently implemented special security measures. Polish newspapers are prohibited from reporting on military activities and mobilization steps. Foreign reporters are also ordered not to publish reports of military situations.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 28th] A diplomatic reporter here recently received an officially authorized statement stating that anti-German incidents occurred in Braunsberg at the southern end of the "Polish Corridor." The German political circles were very surprised to hear this. Anti-German disturbances are increasing in Poland, but it is not yet known whether there is a very serious incident in Braunsberg.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 27th] Authorities claim that no serious disputes have occurred in Braunsberg, but minor conflicts between German and Polish citizens are occasionally heard, but nothing like the incident claimed in Berlin has happened.

### Germany Makes Demands to Poland

[Associated Press, London, 28th] "News Chronicle" reported news from Germany that Germany is closely watching the Danzig issue and has reportedly made several demands to Poland: (1) abolish the Danzig Governor; (2) Germany and Poland establish an agreement to resolve Danzig; (3) all rights of Danzig are returned to Germany, with only a few seaports left to Poland. The newspaper also stated that the Polish government is carefully studying this proposal, and has not yet made a concrete decision on whether to be pro-German or anti-German.

[London, 28th] Foreign news reports that German political circles and Nazi newspapers are paying close attention to Poland. Therefore, there is fear here that Hitler's next action will be to attack Poland. Well-informed sources predict that Germany will soon make several demands to Poland based on Danzig and the "Polish Corridor." Poland announced yesterday domestic bonds of 48 million pounds to strengthen the air force and air defense equipment, indicating that Poland does not want to be the first Czechoslovakia. The number of Polish reserves being called up is increasing daily. Reliable sources say that the armed forces have exceeded 1.5 million people. The civil service organization is currently leading the anti-German movement. The organization issued a resolution yesterday stating, "When Poland speaks, it will be expressed in actions, not words." The National Socialist Party in Berlin took the opportunity of the Polish anti-German demonstrations to publicize that this kind of demonstration is not an isolated case, but has greatly increased in the past few weeks, which is regrettable. A Foreign Ministry official said, "This demonstration is part of an organized action to undermine German-Polish relations." The official also said that the Polish police have received orders that if Germans are attacked, they do not need to take intervention actions. Warsaw expects that this fierce rhetoric from Germany is a prelude to making demands on Poland.

### Romanian Prime Minister's Speech: Determined to Defend Territory; Negotiations with Germany Do Not Affect Independence; Romanian Foreign Minister States No Intimidation Towards Hungary

[Reuters, Bucharest, 27th] Romanian Prime Minister Calinescu spoke today at the Supreme Administrative Department of the National Front, defending Romania's actions in the recent incidents, saying, "Romania is determined to defend its territory. The recent commercial negotiations with Germany have no impact on the issue of Romanian independence. Otherwise, Romania would have abandoned these negotiations." Last autumn, there was an invitation for Romania to invade Ruthenia, but it was ultimately rejected. Also, when Germany issued mobilization orders recently, it notified the powers, stating its intention to defend its territory, and later called up some levels of personnel. Foreign Minister Gafencu continued to speak, saying that Romania's relationship with Poland and the Balkan Entente countries has now become stronger. He specifically mentioned the guarantee provided by Turkey to Romania during the incident, and said that the speech by Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky on March 23 caused surprise in Romania. Gafencu concluded that Romania is not intimidated by Csáky's official title, nor is it willing to argue with him.

Britain Pays Close Attention to Relations with Romania

[Reuters, London, 27th] In its report discussing the German-Romanian commercial agreement, Chamberlain told the House of Commons today: The Romanian government has notified the British government that the German-Romanian agreement does not have political conditions, and Romania has not abandoned its economic independence. Chamberlain said that expanding the British-Romanian commercial agreement and promoting relations between the two countries are the most important issues for the British government. Therefore, a commercial delegation was recently sent to visit Romania. The Romanian government still hopes that the delegation can continue to meet with the Romanian side, which is also the wish of the British government. Romania's signing of a commercial agreement with Germany is inevitable. The true effectiveness of this agreement still depends on how all procedures are implemented. Therefore, it is necessary to wait and see its development before a conclusion can be affirmed. In terms of the current situation, Germany seems to be cooperating with Romania to develop Romania's existing industries, and will also help Romania develop new industries, especially timber and mining industries.

### Chamberlain to Deliver a Speech

[Reuters, London, 27th] The National Conservative Party Central Committee will meet on March 30th in Westminster. Chamberlain will attend as the leader and will deliver a speech to the delegates.

### Another Six Hundred Jews Flee Germany

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 27th] Six hundred Jews here today took a special train to Genoa, then transferred to the "Conte di Savoia" ship to Singapore, Shanghai, the Dutch East Indies, Annam and Siam. This group of Jewish men and women immigrants, mostly young and middle-aged people, include various professionals. Most of them are going to Shanghai, each carrying a small bag containing personal belongings, with assistance from international organizations. They are escorted by German officials to the Italian border along the way.

### Chinese Bonds Rise on the London Market

[Central News Agency, London, 27th] Chinese foreign debt, secured by customs and salt tax, has already been suspended in terms of repayment of principal and interest. However, the Chinese government is beginning to contact the parties concerned to repay the old debts. After this news came out, the market price of Chinese securities here rose accordingly, especially the 5% bond of 1912, which has risen by two points to £38, and the 5% bond of 1922, which has risen by one point to £30.

### British Missionary Killed in Bombing in Pingjiang; Britain Protests to Japan; Compensation Claim to be Filed

[Reuters, London, 27th] Undersecretary Butler said in the House of Commons today in response to an inquiry: On March 15, Japanese aircraft bombed Pingjiang, dropping ten bombs on the local British church, killing eight people, one of whom was a British missionary. There were no other injured British people. The church building had a clear British flag and conspicuous words were written on the ground. The British government has instructed its ambassador to Japan to protest to the Japanese government. When asked whether a claim for compensation has been filed, Butler replied, "Undoubtedly, this claim will be filed in the future."

### Madrid Surrenders! Conscripted Troops Ordered to Disband; Refugee Lines Fill the Roads

[Reuters, Madrid, 28th] After nearly two and a half years of war, Madrid surrendered today. White flags fly everywhere in the city, but it is not yet known when Franco's troops will enter. General Casado, commander-in-chief of the government forces, left the headquarters today. It is generally believed that General Franco will enter Madrid on April 1.

[Reuters, Madrid, 28th] The Foreign Minister of the Spanish National Defense Council, Casado, has ordered the disbandment of conscripted troops, to be summoned again later. This is considered to confirm reports that the government forces no longer wish to resist General Franco. Casado, the former Polish anarchist, and representatives of socialists, spoke widely today, asking the people of Madrid to remain calm. The National Defense Council is currently busy organizing the evacuation of the Spanish people. Spaniards must leave the country, but the people must remain calm and wait for the National Defense Council to dispose of the matter before they can be evacuated. Although negotiations with Franco's army have broken down and the offensive has begun, there is still time for the people to make an orderly retreat if the people do not disturb and flee.

[Central News Agency, Madrid, 28th] The Nationalist army does not yet appear to be launching a general offensive on Madrid. Yesterday, twelve Nationalist army bombers circled over the city, but did not drop bombs. Residents rushed to the police station to apply for passports. On the road between Madrid and Valencia, lines of refugees were endless.

### Franco's Army Begins Offensive

[Reuters, La Mancha, 8th] A communiqué here stated that as a result of Franco's army attacking Cordoba and Toledo, more than 10,000 people have been arrested and captured, and a large amount of military material has been seized. [Reuters, Saint-Jean-de-Luz, 27th] Today, a radio station here announced that Madrid began to evacuate this afternoon.

[Reuters, Burgos, 27th] Franco's army attacked Toledo today, reportedly breaking through the government's line of defense and making great progress. It is reported that the government forces have collapsed.

### US Senate Passes Army Budget Bill; President Roosevelt Asks Congress to Pass Naval Appropriations Bill for Aircraft Purchases

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The Senate today passed the Army budget of $513,000,000, which will be submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion and amendment.

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] When the Senate passed the $513,000,000 Army funding bill yesterday, Senator King stood up and briefly described diplomatic events. He raised the question of what dangers threatened the United States, and suggested reducing the Army funding bill by one-tenth. However, after opposition from the public, he said that he did not believe the United States would be in danger, even if Germany defeated Britain, the United States would not be in danger. Senator Minton said that if Germany defeated Britain, Germany might obtain Bermuda or part of Canada. Senator Ruding then said that the United States could seize Bermuda and other foreign territories in the West Indies to force repayment of war debts. Minton immediately retorted that this was adopting "Hitler's technique."

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] The President has requested Congress to pass a naval appropriation bill of $14,250,000 for the purpose of purchasing additional aircraft in fiscal year 1940.

### Large Army Concentrates in Southern Germany

[London, 28th] Foreign news reports that according to the "Daily Mail" reporter in Geneva, a large German army is concentrated in Württemberg and Bavaria in southern Germany. The Swiss military is very anxious. The Swiss radio station yesterday prayed that the Swiss people remain calm and not believe the alarming rumors from the outside world.

At the same time, frontline warfare has gradually ceased. Negotiations to resolve outstanding issues between the two sides began this afternoon.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Welcoming the Second Mobile Theater Troupe for National Salvation

The Shanghai Drama Circle's Mobile Theater Troupe for National Salvation, since the war of resistance, has left Shanghai and traveled through Suzhou, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Hankou, Shangcheng, Macheng, and other places. Then, it went south along the Yuehan Railway, turning into Hunan and entering Guangxi. Along the way, through drama performances and songs, it propagated and educated the people, mobilizing the people, and achieved very good results. When the team departed from Shanghai, there were only fourteen people, led by the progressive film stars Mr. Jin Shan and Ms. Wang Ying. Along the way, it attracted many outstanding comrades. Because of hard work and a serious lifestyle, it received sponsorships from social figures and military and political authorities everywhere. Now, in order to go overseas to expand national salvation propaganda, and to appeal to overseas Chinese on behalf of the front-line soldiers, a group of more than 30 people arrived in Hong Kong from Guangxi the day before yesterday.

Our overseas Chinese should express sincere respect for the past efforts of the team and for this overseas propaganda trip. We hope that after the team arrives in Nanyang and other places, on the one hand, it will widely and deeply publicize the actual situation of the strong unity of all parties, armies, and people of all circles throughout the country, supporting the sustained ××, to the overseas Chinese and international figures, in order to enhance the self-esteem and self-confidence of the overseas Chinese, and to increase the prestige of our central government ×× party and the entire nation internationally. On the other hand, it should expose and uncover the ××××××××××××× and the recent conspiracy facts as much as possible, so that overseas Chinese and international figures in various places thoroughly understand: ××××××××××××××××××; the Chinese nation is still at a critical juncture of survival, and the front-line soldiers and the rear people are urgently in need of assistance, in order to launch overseas Chinese and international figures to use greater spiritual and material strength to assist the ×× nation-building cause.

At the same time, we hope that overseas Chinese from all walks of life, especially those in the cultural circles, will warmly welcome the team with the feelings of brothers and sisters returning home, and should also provide more practical help in their work, so that the team can achieve the results it deserves!

### The Conspiracy to Prosper Guangzhou

The fall of Guangzhou, although a strategic inevitability, is something that every patriotic compatriot, especially those from Guangdong, cannot help but feel pain and hatred for. The only thing that can express the great revolutionary spirit of our Guangdong compatriots is that the people of Guangdong will never cooperate with × traitors and will never be submissive to a lost country. Therefore, the × has occupied Guangzhou for five months now, and all it has gained is a scorched earth, which not only greatly loses the original intention of the × people occupying Guangzhou, but also enough to strike a blow at the × people's further strategy.

Now that the war of resistance is turning to the second stage, the × people are eagerly seeking to rectify the occupied areas in order to further launch the "final conquest of China." Recently, they have actively carried out the so-called "prosperity" plan for Guangzhou, attempting to induce Guangzhou compatriots who have taken refuge elsewhere to "prosper" Guangzhou and to help the × people prepare for further strategies. For example, sending special ships to run between Guangzhou and Macau, and negotiating with the British Consulate in Guangdong to resume the Hong Kong-Guangdong route immediately, conspiracies and cunning are endless. We believe that the Guangdong compatriots who have a historical honor will never be deceived and will not ruin the country themselves. However, in the midst of displacement and hardship, the difficulty of livelihood and the longing for the homeland are also common human feelings. We hope that everyone will recognize that the difficulties we encounter today are all given by the × traitors, so only everyone prepares ×××× and restores the homeland. Only then will everyone have a way to survive. At the same time, we also hope that the government and civil groups will work together to ensure that the poor displaced compatriots have the opportunity to return to the country to participate in the ×× nation-building work, and to do their best to guarantee their minimum standard of living without automatically returning home to be submissive people; to provide for the × traitors to drive and enslave. For the displaced compatriots above the middle class, we should especially encourage them to invest in and operate in the inland economic establishment. Now that the United Kingdom and the United States are still constantly providing economic assistance to us, do we ourselves not consider the safety of investment and operation? Great construction projects are waiting for us to develop! The motherland is warmly welcoming us! We not only want to ×××× the conspiracy to "prosper" Guangzhou, but also dedicate ourselves to the motherland, and build a prosperous and happy new China from ××!

### France Increases Naval Personnel; Cabinet Decides on Important National Defense Laws; British Army Chief of Staff to Attend French Maneuvers

[Reuters, Paris, 27th] Yesterday, the French cabinet discussed and decided on several important national defense laws, including laws to increase naval personnel, amend the naval supplement law, increase naval engineering personnel, border defense laws (content not disclosed), and industrial mobilization laws. During the cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Bonnet reported on the situation and the diplomatic talks he recently had in England.

[Central News Agency, London, 27th] British Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Gort, at the invitation of French Chief of Staff General Gamelin, will lead several military experts by plane to France tomorrow to visit the military maneuvers and inspect the Maginot Line on the country's border.

### Italy and Germany's Interests Clash, Leading to Friction; Germany Attempts to Extend its Influence to Southern Countries, While France Insists on its Original Position

[Central News Agency, Paris, 27th] The summoning of three German minority members of the Yugoslav parliament to Berlin has sparked much discussion in political circles here. It is generally believed that Germany has proposed commercial recommendations to Yugoslavia, seeking to include the Yugoslav market within Germany's vital sphere of influence. This plan directly clashes with Italian interests. When the Rome-Berlin Axis was formed, both sides divided their spheres of influence in the Danube region, with Austria and Czechoslovakia falling under German control, while Romania and Yugoslavia were assigned to Italian control. Hungary, however, was designated as a shared sphere of influence between Italy and Germany. This outline was confirmed in 1937 when Prime Minister Mussolini invited Germany. Subsequently, Austria and Czechoslovakia were either incorporated into Germany as provinces or became German protectorates. Romania was also forced to sign commercial treaties with Germany, granting it significant economic benefits. As a result, Italy had to purchase oil from the Soviet Union and, to secure favorable prices, disregarded the Soviet Union's status as a target of the Anti-Comintern Pact, instead undertaking the construction of warships for them. Now, with Germany expanding its influence to Yugoslavia, Mussolini, likely aware of this, could no longer tolerate it. Therefore, in his speech yesterday, he explicitly declared that Italy's interests in the Adriatic Sea should be in a superior position. Until 1932, Italy considered Yugoslavia a formidable neighbor, with its winding coastline providing a natural barrier for the navy, far superior to Italy's flat and exposed coastline. Consequently, in 1937, Italy signed a treaty of friendship with Yugoslavia, thus eliminating the crisis posed by Yugoslavia. However, if German influence now encroaches upon Yugoslavia, it will create a new crisis for Italy. Recently, there have been rumors that Italy intends to occupy Albania. While this has not been confirmed, informed sources suggest that if Germany exceeds the limitations agreed upon within the Rome-Berlin Axis and acquires various rights in Yugoslavia, Italy will inevitably react. Given this development, Italy's focus in the Mediterranean will not only be on the relationship between France and Italy, but this influence will naturally directly affect France.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th] According to informed sources, if Italy is prepared to negotiate with France and has specific topics for negotiation, France is prepared to engage in talks with Italy. Negotiations regarding Gibraltar, Tunisia, and the Suez Canal may not fall within the scope of the 1935 Franco-Italian Agreement, but such negotiations cannot stray too far from this basis. Regarding the status of Italians in Tunisia, France has no intention of negotiating based on the 1896 treaty. Unless Italy expresses its position on various issues, even if France initiates negotiations, it will be fruitless and only worsen the current situation.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 27th] French newspapers, in discussing Mussolini's speech, almost unanimously agree that if Italy believes it has fair demands on France, the Italian government should initiate diplomatic negotiations with France. The semi-official "Petit Parisien" newspaper published an article today with a markedly different tone from other newspapers, suggesting that Italy could easily find a suitable mediator to present its demands to France. The newspaper also added that the Mediterranean is as important to France as it is to Italy.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 27th] British newspapers remain skeptical of the correct interpretation of Mussolini's speech. The newspapers state that this is the first time Mussolini has officially mentioned Tunisia, Gibraltar, and the Suez Canal, but whether his ultimate goal is a fundamental territorial change or a "moderate correction" remains unclear. The "Daily Mail" believes that the Franco-Italian dispute is not enough to cause a war and can be resolved through negotiation. The "Daily Express" calls Mussolini's speech "a gentle thunder" and believes that Mussolini has abandoned his colonial demands. The "Times" suggests that clever diplomacy could make Mussolini's speech a pivotal moment for a shift in the European situation.

[Associated Press, Paris, 28th] Government ministers began exchanging views this morning, and after consultations this evening, a consensus has been largely reached to follow Mussolini's speech in hopes of resolving the issues of Tunisia, Gibraltar, and the Suez Canal between France and Italy. However, the cabinet is not planning to immediately engage in negotiations with Italy. It is reported that if the government wishes to engage in negotiations with Italy soon, Foreign Minister Bonnet may resign, not because he opposes these Franco-Italian negotiations, but because he, in his capacity as Foreign Minister, has criticized the Rome-Berlin Axis for being unjust and unrighteous.

[Haitong News Agency, San Sebastian, 27th] Government troops in the university district of Madrid have surrendered to Franco's forces. The situation elsewhere is unknown.

### In Response to the Perilous World Situation, Hong Kong Actively Strengthens Security and Defense; British Army, Navy, and Air Force Personnel Continue to be Increased and Transferred to Hong Kong

In light of the turbulent world situation in recent years, the Hong Kong authorities have been actively promoting security and defense measures for Hong Kong for the past two to three years in preparation. Today, the security preparations for the sea, land, and air have reached a considerable degree of consolidation, capable of responding to any eventuality.

Military Personnel Continue to Arrive from the East

At the same time, British military authorities feel the need to rapidly increase the number of naval, land, and air personnel in Hong Kong. Air Force personnel have already been successively transferred eastwards. Similar actions are being taken with naval and land military personnel. According to reports, more than 500 naval combat personnel aboard the HMS Lancashire are en route to Hong Kong, and the transport ship Dunera will also carry a considerable number of military personnel to Hong Kong on May 25th of this year to strengthen defenses. In addition, a large number of senior naval, land, and air specialized technical personnel will also come to the East to assist the Hong Kong defense forces in planning all security and defense facilities.

Recruitment of Foreign Soldiers Continues

In addition, in order to supplement the insufficient number of defense forces in overseas territories, British military authorities have been recruiting soldiers of other nationalities in all territories, in addition to organizing local volunteer forces, and assigning them to defense force training. Hong Kong has also long been ordered to carry this out. The recruitment of Chinese engineers and artillerymen has been carried out to the fifth and sixth phases, and the number of people is also quite large. Currently, the decision is to continue recruiting these Chinese soldiers, so that within a certain period of time, all Chinese soldiers recruited before and after can have full combat capabilities. The volunteer army has been established for a long time, but it is still far from the original number of personnel. It has now been decided to expand the organization, recruit Chinese and Western personnel to participate in training, so as to become an elite force. The organization of the overseas territory air force volunteer team, which was promulgated by the British military authorities not long ago, is currently being planned and implemented in Hong Kong.

### A Large Gang of Pirates Robbed a Cargo Boat in the Waters off Sha Jing, Baoan; 27 Pirates Armed with Weapons Intercepted and Robbed the Cargo Owner, Who Was Shot and Wounded; All Cargo Worth 6,000 Yuan Was Robbed

Zhang Guang, a water carrier from Dongguan, transported a large batch of goods worth about 6,000 yuan from his hometown on the 13th of this month, and took an unknown cargo boat to Hong Kong. At 7:00 pm on the same day, when they arrived in the waters of Shajing, Baoan, they suddenly encountered a pirate boat, with about 27 bandits on board, all armed with sharp firearms, who intercepted their way. They swarmed onto the boat, threatened the boatmen, and searched for the cargo owner. Zhang, seeing the situation, was afraid of being kidnapped by the pirates, so he took advantage of the pirates' unawareness and sneaked into the corner of the boat to hide, hoping to avoid it. However, he was eventually found by the pirates, who were extremely angry. They fired three shots at Zhang, one hitting Zhang's left thigh, one hitting his right arm, and one missing. He bled profusely and passed out in pain. The pirates thought Zhang was dead, so they ignored him and forced the crew to take the boat to the waters near Shatin Estuary, where they began to transport the cargo to the pirate boat and fled. After the pirates left, the crew rescued Zhang and provided local medical treatment. They stayed in Shatin Estuary for four days. They set sail for Hong Kong on the 17th and arrived on the 21st. Zhang's injury had not yet healed, so he hired a doctor at home to recuperate. He did not report to the police until the day before yesterday, because his injury became more and more serious. He went to Tsim Sha Tsui to report the case and was transferred to the French Hospital for medical treatment. After receiving the report, the police immediately filed the case and sent telegrams to various parties to assist in arresting the robbers.

### Fundamentally Solving the Water Shortage, the Plan is Largely Completed; Dozens of Large and Small Reservoirs Have Been Completed in Hong Kong and Kowloon; Two Major Cross-Harbor Pipelines Can Be Installed in May

Hong Kong is an island, and the water supply for more than one million people depends on rainfall. Once the weather is dry, there is a risk of water shortage. The Hong Kong authorities have been actively working to solve the water shortage in recent years. The completion of the Shing Mun Reservoir is the realization of the first step in solving the water shortage.

Wood, an Engineer, Three-Year Plan

In the year before last, the Hong Kong government authorities accepted the three-year plan of Wood, an engineer from the Waterworks Department, to build reservoirs to solve the water shortage, and allocated a huge budget of three million yuan as the use to implement this plan. The content of this plan is roughly to build a large number of reservoirs at the top of Hong Kong Island to collect large amounts of rainwater to meet the needs of Hong Kong residents. In Kowloon, a large number of reservoirs are built near the Shing Mun Reservoir, such as Tai Mo Shan and Kowloon Tsai, and the water obtained is completely stored in the Shing Mun Reservoir. At the same time, a great cross-harbor pipeline is installed to connect the surplus water volume in Kowloon to supplement the deficiency in Hong Kong. After the above plan was accepted by the government authorities, the original budgeted funds were allocated, and various projects began in the spring of last year. Until now, most of this project has been completed in accordance with the original plan.

Project Costs Reach Four Million

Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Wood, the engineer of the Waterworks Department, the original proposer of the project, and asked about the recent progress. According to reports, the three-year plan to solve the water shortage started from 1937 (the year before last) and will be completed in 1940. The initial budget for this project was originally set at three million yuan, but according to the current progress, the cost of the entire project may increase to four million yuan when completed. Regarding the construction of reservoirs in the Peak area, more than 50 large and small reservoirs have been completed, the larger ones can hold 21.1 million gallons of water, and the smaller ones can hold 1 million gallons of water. On the Kowloon Peninsula, the reservoirs built in Kowloon and Tai Mo Shan have also been completed. The Kowloon Tsai Reservoir can hold 60 million gallons of water. The area of the reservoirs in Tai Mo Shan was originally set at 3,051 acres. Now, due to the shortage of rain, in order to absorb more rainwater, it has been specially expanded by 1,000 acres, with a total area of 4,51 acres, all of which have been fully built.

Cross-Harbor Pipeline Will Be Completed Soon

As for the cross-harbor pipeline transporting drinking water from Kowloon to Hong Kong, because the original one only had a diameter of 18 inches and the area was too small to transport a large amount of drinking water, two new large cross-harbor pipelines were installed in November last year. The diameter has been expanded to 21 inches. Now the installation of the two pipes has been completed by 80 or 90 percent. One is a commonly used pipe, and the other is a spare pipe, which can be used when the commonly used pipe is damaged, so that the water supply will not be cut off. It is expected to be fully completed around May of this year. The problem of water shortage in Hong Kong can also be solved to some extent, and the suffering of residents due to "water rationing" can also be solved.

### Legislative Council to Hold Routine Meeting Tomorrow Afternoon; Attorney General and Others Have Proposals

The Hong Kong Legislative Council is scheduled to hold a routine meeting at 2:30 pm tomorrow. At that time, Colonial Secretary Smith will propose the adoption of Report No. 2 of the Finance Meeting of March 23, 1939.

### Boeing No. 2 Returned Yesterday; 13 Passengers Yesterday

Pan American Boeing No. 2 stayed overnight in Hong Kong the day before yesterday. The original plane was scheduled to take off at 8:30 am yesterday and fly back to San Francisco via the Philippines, but when it took off, the weather was bad and there was a heavy fog, which was delayed until 11:00 am before it could take off. Yesterday, 13 passengers left Hong Kong on the plane, including Mr. and Mrs. Locke and their son from the Datta Oil Company. In the past, when American planes came to Hong Kong from the United States, they would change the crew in the plane when they flew back to San Francisco, so that they could have a considerable rest in the Philippines. However, this time, the Boeing plane used the original crew on its return journey, and the crew of the Philippine Clipper who stayed in Hong Kong last time took the same plane back to the United States. Also, the China Clipper will arrive in Hong Kong on Monday, the 3rd of next month, and return the next morning.

### Aviation School Trainee Who Went Missing While Flying; Liao Zuo Returned Safely; Forced to Land in Ma Shi Wan Due to Heavy Fog; Stayed Overnight and Returned to Hong Kong at 10:00 am Yesterday

Wong Chor Chi, a student at the Hong Kong Far East Aviation School, flew alone in training plane VRHCX at 3:00 pm the day before yesterday. It was late at night and he had not yet returned to Hong Kong. The authorities of the Far East Aviation School were afraid that he had an accident in the middle, and yesterday continued to send three planes to search for him. After the first plane flew out at 9:40 am, Wong suddenly flew back in the original plane and landed safely at Kai Tak Airport at 10:20 am. According to Wong's description of his disappearance, he took off from Kai Tak Airport at 3:15 pm the day before yesterday and was originally scheduled to fly for one hour. Unexpectedly, not long after taking off, he was blocked by dense clouds in the sky and lost his direction. After an hour, he still could not find his direction, so he landed on the beach on the coast below. After Wong landed safely, he realized that the place was Daya Bay in the occupied area of × Army. Regardless of the bad weather, he flew away from the place and landed in Ma Shi, which is the British border. At that time, the clouds in the sky had not yet dissipated. Wong knew that there was no way to fly back to Hong Kong, so he decided to stay overnight. He asked the locals for some food to fill his stomach and spent the night in the plane. Yesterday at 19:30, he took off and returned to Hong Kong. At 10:20 am, he landed safely at Kai Tak Airport.

### The Joint Relief Association Held a General Meeting Yesterday; "Huanghuagang" Scheduled for Charity Performance in Early May; From May 3rd for Three Consecutive Days at the Taiping Theatre; All Proceeds Will be Used to Console the Families of Fallen Soldiers

### A Large Rice Company; A Large Amount of Rice Stored in Hong Kong has been Shipped to Shantou; The First Batch of 200,000 Dan was Shipped Out Yesterday; The Rice Shortage in Chaoshan Can be Eliminated in the Short Term

Due to the impact of the war and traffic congestion, the grain and rice regulation in the Chaoshan, Zhongshun and Siyi counties in Guangdong was out of order, resulting in a rice shortage. The general public was suffering. Fortunately, after the overseas and domestic groups in the counties called on the central government, Minister Kong sympathized with the people's difficulties and approved more than 1 million dan of foreign rice to be tax-free and transported to the rice-stricken counties for rapid assistance. Overseas Chinese groups in the counties also purchased a large amount of foreign rice to be transported to the mainland for price stabilization in order to save their hometowns from distress. It has been found that the central government's quota for tax-free foreign rice in the Chaoshan area is 700,000 metric tons. Local rice merchants have already started to arrange for imports. A considerable amount of rice merchants in Hong Kong have also been transported to Shantou. Yesterday, according to sources in the rice business, a large rice company had previously ordered hundreds of thousands of dan of foreign rice from Annam and Siam, which was transported to Hong Kong for storage. It was originally planned to transport it back to the mainland for sales, but later it did not work out. Now that the tax-free quota for foreign rice has been stipulated and approved, and it is felt that the rice shortage in Chaoshan is more serious, the company transported a large amount of rice to Shantou. The first batch of 200,000 dan has been shipped out, and the rest will be transferred and transported one after another.

### Everywhere on the Road; Sham Shui Po Shek Kip Mei Street; Young Men and Women Robbed While Walking at Night; Three Strong Men Robbed with Knives and Scissors; Passers-by Helped Chase and Arrested Two Robbers

A robbery occurred on Shek Kip Mei Street, Sham Shui Po, at 10:00 pm last night. Two suspected robbers were arrested on the spot. It was found that a man, Feng Zhinian, 17 years old, was an employee of a sewing shop. Last night, he went out with his girlfriend Chen Meiyan (18 years old). They walked side by side along Shek Kip Mei Road, Sham Shui Po, chatting softly. The place was secluded and there were few people. It was even quieter at night. When the two young men and women were about to reach Da Pu Road, three strong men suddenly rushed out of the trail with sharp butcher knives, blocked their way, and forbade them to speak out. They searched and robbed them, taking away the gold jewelry and cash in their pockets, including a white steel watch, two gold rings, and a wallet, with a total value of 39 yuan and 4 jiao. After succeeding, they ran away separately. After the robbers left, Feng was unwilling to lose and called out for the robbers. Passers-by gathered after hearing the news and chased after the robbers in the direction shown by Feng. They finally caught two robbers at the end of Shek Kip Mei Road and recovered the stolen gold rings worth 18 yuan from their bodies. The remaining watches and other items had been taken away by the fleeing robbers and could not be recovered. Feng and others handed over the two robbers and the lost stolen goods to the police station in Sham Shui Po to report the case. The losses this time, in addition to the two rings recovered, are still worth 21 yuan and 4 jiao.

### Alarming Incident: Robberies Occurring Repeatedly on Prince Edward Road; Criminals' Meticulous Plans: Another Robbery Occurred Yesterday Morning; Three Criminals Arrested; Documents Found Revealing Exhaustive Investigation into the Lives of Wealthy Individuals

In Kowloon, robbery cases have been occurring continuously, causing unrest and disorder. Although the police have repeatedly arrested the criminals involved, they have not been able to eradicate them completely. Not long after a robbery occurred at a Westerner's residence on Prince Edward Road, the Wah On Gold Shop on Shanghai Street in Mong Kok was also robbed, with losses exceeding thousands of dollars in each case. The criminals involved were all armed with sharp weapons and acted as if no one was around. After the above two major robberies, the police immediately intensified their strict investigation and arrest efforts, with police officers being mobilized one after another. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, another robbery occurred on Prince Edward Road. Upon hearing the news, the police chased after the criminals and arrested three men. In addition, they found a batch of important documents on one of the criminals, which indicated that the criminals were not acting alone but were part of a planned organization.

Three Criminals Rob a Female Servant

It was found that since the robbery at the home of Mrs. Cambridge, a Western woman living at 194 Prince Edward Road, with losses exceeding one thousand dollars, the police had been paying attention to the activities of criminals in that area. Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, Yu Yu, a 44-year-old female servant from a Westerner's residence at 207 Prince Edward Road, went out to shop. Unexpectedly, as soon as she stepped outside, she was surrounded by three criminals. One of the criminals threw pepper powder into her eyes. Yu, caught off guard, quickly covered her eyes with both hands and shouted for help. The robbers then seized the opportunity to snatch her money, about one dollar, and fled. At that moment, Chinese police officers Nos. 2, 3, and 4 and a coolie named Jia from the Dairy Farm Company rushed to the scene upon hearing the cries and intercepted the criminals. They captured the three suspected criminals and took them to the Sham Shui Po Police Station for questioning. Yu was sent to Kowloon Hospital for treatment.

Documents Discovered; Secrets Uncovered

When the three suspected criminals were taken to the police station, they were interrogated by the officer on duty and searched. Unexpectedly, many documents were found on one of them, which were sufficient to prove their involvement in the robberies that had occurred on Prince Edward Road in the past two months. According to the contents of the documents, the frequent robberies on Prince Edward Road were actually a kind of organized and planned action by the criminals. The documents described the details of each robbery, especially the living habits of the wealthy Westerners in the Prince Edward Road area, in great detail, such as when the male owner went to work, when he returned home, and when the female owner went out. The police will conduct an investigation based on these documents in order to solve all the cases and quell the criminal activity. The three suspected criminals who have been arrested will be charged during the day.

### × Attempting to Dominate Shipping Rights: Will Block the Pearl River Again: Using Military Operations as an Excuse, Only Allowing Japanese Ships to Pass: The Jinshan Ship Suspended Operations Yesterday; the Foshan Ship to Guangzhou Today

Since the fall of Guangzhou, × has been attempting to dominate the Pearl River waterway, using military operations as an excuse to block it and prohibit foreign ships from passing. Although the British have repeatedly negotiated, only partial opening has been achieved. According to the most relevant sources, the Guangzhou × army is now using military operations as an excuse to block the waterway again in the near future, not allowing foreign ships to pass, only allowing × warships and their ships to pass. Regarding this news, the British have not made any comments. The Jinshan ship, originally scheduled to sail to Guangzhou for the fourth time yesterday morning, was temporarily changed to the Foshan ship because its machinery was slightly damaged en route from Hong Kong to Macau yesterday. The Foshan ship will sail to Guangzhou this morning at 9:00 AM. Yesterday afternoon, the ship was already berthed at the Guangdong-Hong Kong ferry pier, adding coal. It was found that ticket sales from Hong Kong to Guangdong had already been stopped yesterday, with a total of three hundred tickets sold. It was found that Guangzhou has been in a state of chaos since its fall more than five months ago and remains no different from a dead city. The state of terror is even worse than before. Many compatriots who fled do not dare to go there. Even those who are lured back are trying to escape.

Thanks to the purchase of tickets by people from all walks of life and the voluntary performances of Ms. Jin Suqin and Ms. Lu Cuilan, as well as the joint donation of 500 yuan by Mr. Li Lianfang and Ms. Lu Cuilan, the results were very impressive, with a total of approximately 5,200 yuan raised.

…The Hong Kong Sugar Merchants' Association collected a total of 4,000 yuan (National Currency) in long-term charity donations for February 1938. The association's Disaster Relief Committee resolved to hand over the full amount of the charity donation to the Hong Kong Bank of China on March 27 for remittance to the Ministry of Finance of the National Government.

…Yun Zhaokun, Deputy Governor of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, was previously ordered by Chairman Li Hanhun of the Guangdong Provincial Government to visit and comfort overseas compatriots in Singapore on behalf of the government and to preside over the opening of the Singapore branch. It is now learned that the Singapore branch opened on the 20th of this month. Yun has completed his official duties and will return west by ship, scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong today.

### After Heroic Resistance, Our Troops in Southern Guangdong Painfully Withdraw from Rongqi and Guizhou: Under the Cover of Superior × Land, Sea, and Air Forces, They Launch a Fierce Offensive: Our Troops Suffer Heavy Casualties and Are Now Assembling in Dahu for a Counterattack

[Jiangmen Express Report] In order to complete their plan to sweep the Pearl River Delta, eliminate our guerrilla forces, and consolidate the outer defenses of Guangzhou, the × army has repeatedly attacked Rongqi and Guizhou after occupying Daliang. Because our troops bravely resisted, the attacks were unsuccessful. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 27th, they sent more than 600 additional infantry troops, divided into three routes, to attack Ronggui again. Our troops immediately rose up to resist, creating an unprecedented battle. But ultimately, because the × artillery fire was fierce and the fortifications were completely destroyed, it was impossible to hold. Until 2:00 PM, they were forced to withdraw painfully. The details are recorded as follows: Before dawn on the 27th, the × army in Daliang sent more than 100 × soldiers, divided into three routes, to attack Ronggui. One route departed from Yongkou, north of Guizhou, on seven speedboats, covered by two shallow-water warships; one route went straight to Tangchang along the Rongqi Highway; and one route went straight to Rongqi and Xutou from the Daliang Electric Boat Pier. Each route had about 200 people, rushing into Ronggui secretly. At that time, most of the people in Ronggui and other places were still in their beds. Suddenly hearing the sound of guns and artillery, they knew that the × army was attacking and fled in panic, supporting the old and carrying the young, and retreating towards the Xiaokang area. When the × army attacked, the guerrilla forces stationed in Ronggui immediately divided up to fight and bravely resisted. After dawn, more than ten × planes continued to fly over to provide cover, bombing Ronggui fiercely. With the cover of aircraft and fierce steel artillery, the × army took the opportunity to rush into our military positions. However, our troops were determined to coexist with × and engaged in fierce battles with the × army. Until about 1:00 PM, all the fortifications had been destroyed, and most of our troops had been sacrificed, so they were forced to withdraw painfully. After our troops withdrew, the × army successively occupied Ronggui and then began to burn and kill on a large scale. Large fires broke out in the city, with flames raging and thick smoke rising straight into the sky. Even at 5:00 PM, the fires had not been extinguished. Also, when the × army landed at Sishengyuan, Liang Zhuowen, the captain of the battalion, commanded the resistance. His troops disregarded their own safety and fought hand-to-hand with the × army, eventually making a heroic sacrifice. Now, after our troops withdrew, they were ordered to move to Dahuangpu to block the × army's advance and wait for an opportunity to counterattack.

### A Senior General of a Certain Route Talks About Our Counteroffensive Military Affairs: A Large-Scale Counteroffensive Plan Has Been Determined: The Central Government Will Allocate a Large Number of Aircraft to Boost Morale

[Beijiang Express Report] Yesterday, a reporter visited a certain staff member of a certain route army in a certain war zone and asked about the recent counteroffensive military situation. According to the staff member, the counteroffensive military affairs of our various route armies have been actively advancing in recent days. Regarding the recent military and political situation, the following can be reported to you:

1. After the Central Committee held a military conference on the 14th, it handed over the military plan for the counteroffensive in South China to a certain high-ranking official to take back. He is now convening senior generals from various routes to distribute the large-scale counteroffensive plan. As for this plan, because it concerns military secrets, it cannot be fully disclosed to you. However, the purpose of this counteroffensive is to break the main force of the × army. Now our heavy military equipment has been concentrated on a certain front line, and we will inflict a major blow on × on this front line.

2. After parts of Qiongyai, such as the urban area and Wenchang, were occupied by ×, General Bai Xixi has formulated a complete plan for our future counteroffensive and defense of existing positions and submitted it to the Supreme Commander for approval. The military has new deployments, and it can be launched simultaneously once the general counteroffensive order is issued. Currently, the Qiongshu × telecommunications has been restricted by our army and has made no progress in the past week.

3. The Guangxi Branch of the Central Military Academy has been greatly expanded this year. Each class of artillery, infantry, and cavalry has added overseas Chinese classes, which have been training for many months. The infantry course can graduate in July of this year. The cavalry and artillery courses require more practical training for half a year because the academic and technical aspects are more complex than infantry. Last year, our authorities hired more than 20 Soviet instructors to teach artillery at the school. These students may be a major help to the war of resistance in the future.

4. Before Guangzhou fell, the Guangdong Provincial Air Force had planned a strong air defense network, establishing 20 aviation zones in the important counties of Guangdong, each zone divided into several sub-zones, and each sub-zone divided into several airports. After Guangzhou fell, this plan was not suspended. Recently, as the counteroffensive military affairs have become urgent, the central government has allocated more than 200 bombers, fighters, and other aircraft to be stationed in the airports within the aviation zones that have been completed. Currently, 30 or more airports are being completed urgently for counteroffensive purposes. Once the project is completed, the central government will send more aircraft to be stationed there. Once this air defense network is completed, it will be the most powerful authority for the counteroffensive military affairs.

5. In recent days, due to the influence of the international community, our confidence in the victory of the war of resistance has been greatly increased. Our diplomatic situation has also had a new trend. Therefore, our authorities will send Sun Ke, Wang Zhengting, Shi Zhaoji, Yan Huqing and others to the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries for political liaison. Recently, we have also obtained active assistance from France, the Netherlands, and other countries, which will sell us a large amount of military supplies. Therefore, as far as the current situation is concerned, our war of resistance situation is very optimistic.

### × Soldiers Land Again to Burn and Plunder: Nan'ao is Severely Devastated

[Shantou Express Report] The terrain of Nan'ao County is originally an island, isolated in the sea. After several battles, although × has withdrawn, we do not set up defenses because there is no danger to defend. The county seat must be set up somewhere, and public security is maintained by the township and town offices. After this, × sent troops to invade and disturb, landing to burn and plunder many times. Until the 24th of this month, a × warship sent troops to land again, looting and burning houses wantonly. Most of the local residents are poor fishermen. After experiencing repeated trampling, they can no longer bear it. Adding to this wanton destruction, the population is declining day by day and the fields are barren. Although × will not withdraw immediately, the local vitality has been greatly damaged and there is really no hope of recovery.

### Our Northern Route Lineup is Reorganized: Controlling × Closely: Our Mechanical Units are Steadily Heading South: Strong Lines of Defense Are Deployed in Each Stronghold

[Beijiang Express Report] On each of the Guangdong Province lines, our × are busy with various deployments, especially on the Northern Route where deployments are particularly busy. It has been found that the strength of our army on the Northern Route has indeed increased several times compared to before, since the recent steady stream of mechanical units have been sent south to increase defenses. According to military news, Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth War Zone, has reorganized and adjusted the defense affairs of the various armies on the Northern Route in order to cooperate with the progress of the counteroffensive military affairs. After intensifying deployments for nearly ten days, it has now been completed, and the lineup has been renewed. It has been found that the foremost of our troops stationed on the front line of the Northern Route include the Liang, Chen, Li, Zhang, Kong, and other division units of the Tenth Army Corps, who are responsible for the Zengcong line, the Kong Division for the Conghua area, the Peng, Chen, and other divisions for the front of the Guangdong road and the Guanghua line, and the Li Division for the Huasanjian and Tantan lines. Taking a concerted encirclement posture towards × with an arc-shaped line, they are constantly launching attacks against the × entrenched in the strongholds of Xinjie, Fengyong, Hengtan, Xiangshan, Shijiao, Shengang, and Taiping. The large army newly arrived in northern Guangdong is stationed along the Yuehan Railway and in the outer lines of Qingyuan, Yingde, and Fogang. Strong lines of defense are deployed in each stronghold, and close contact is maintained with friendly forces within the inner perimeter, controlling the × on the Northern Line.

### Yu Hanmou Goes to Chongqing: Xiang Hanping Waits for Instructions in Chongqing

(Guilin Aviation Report) Yu Hanmou, Commander-in-Chief of the Twelfth Army Corps, arrived here a few days ago and visited Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Headquarters, to discuss military affairs. Currently, Yu has transferred from Guilin to Chongqing, reportedly to visit the highest authorities to make requests. Also, Xiang Hanping, former Deputy Commander of the Fourth Route Army, is already in Chongqing, ordered by the central authorities to go to a certain place to handle important official business. He is also waiting for Yu's arrival to discuss matters before proceeding.

### Shipping Special

The Jinshan ship did not go to the province yesterday morning. It was due to the fact that the ship was damaged when it returned to Hong Kong from Macau the morning before, so it sent a telegram to the Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Macau Shipping Company in Hong Kong to announce everything. After learning of this, the company asked Kowloon Dockyard to send a tugboat to Macau in order to tow it back. It was found that the Kowloon Dockyard tugboat EDITH had departed at 1:00 AM the day before yesterday and was scheduled to return to Hong Kong yesterday, but there was still no news as of yesterday evening's deadline. The company is now sending the Foshan ship to replace it and will set sail this morning at 9:00 AM and return to Hong Kong on the 31st at 9:00 AM. The company has not yet announced whether the Foshan ship can join the Hong Kong-Macau route after it returns to Hong Kong. The × ship Guangdong Maru, which arrived in Hong Kong last night, is also scheduled to go to the province at 8:00 AM this morning.

### The Thousand-Mile Horse on Hainan Island

— Tieguang

The raging tide on Hainan Island, like many other places, is increasingly roaring widely. The seeds of people's struggle that have been dormant for ten years have been ignited into a more intense light due to the deep penetration of the × cavalry.

It is absolutely not wrong to say that the tragic holocaust that Japanese × imperialism has given to Hainan Island has made the people there even more united with themselves in this holocaust. It is absolutely not an exaggeration to say that Hainan Island has actually improved its original appearance and boosted its dragon-like vitality from the attacks of startling storms. This vitality is manifested in:

The people's anti-× forces, reorganized from the past Red Army, first blew their horns of rushing and falling into battle. Under the planning of General Wang Yi, the military leader of Qiongyai, and under the leadership of General Feng Baiju, the leader of the People's Self-Defense Force, they first broke the encirclement of the × army near Haikou Fucheng, and the second time they annihilated hundreds of stubborn soldiers of the × army on the Tankou line. The third time, in the Sanjiang area, they not only defeated the attacking plan of the × army but also killed its commander Ando and chief of staff Yamada. There is also a national heroine Liu Qiuju. She is also a strong leader of the guerrillas, defeating the stubborn attack of the × army in Choulong City. All these facts have fully developed the combat power of the Qiongyai people. The × army also deeply felt that the armed forces of the Qiongyai people could not be easily insulted. Due to the existence and development of these facts, the anti-Japanese achievements of General Feng Baiju in Qiongyai, like General Gan Yi, were greatly revealed. The Qiongyai people said in unison that General Wang Yi and General Luo Baiju are the two major supports for anti-Japanese resistance on Hainan Island. The victorious future of anti-Japanese resistance on Hainan Island needs the joint leadership, responsibility, and development of the Wang and Feng generals. Please take another look at the following fact:

People Say, "Call the Thousand-Mile Horse"

General Wang Yi is truly worthy of being a leader who loves the people's armed forces. General Feng Baiju is even more a resolute commander of the people's armed forces. In the entire area of Qiongyai, there are still 60,000 people's armed forces that have not been mobilized and organized. General Wang Yi then sent capable personnel to various districts to mobilize and organize. The people are anti-Japanese, and the people will never reject the mobilization of organization in any way. However, most people said to the people that General Wang Yi sent there, "We are willing to take up guns and organize immediately, but please call the 'Thousand-Mile Horse' to lead us before we can..."

Those personnel asked with a somewhat inexplicable look, "Who exactly is the Thousand-Mile Horse?"

The people replied with a smile, "Don't you know who the person with this nickname is? Baiju is a good white horse, and this good horse is the 'Thousand-Mile Horse'. Don't you know that this is Mr. Feng Baiju's nickname?"

Those personnel then understood the origin of the name "Thousand-Mile Horse" and also deeply knew the trust of those armed people of Qiongyai in General Feng Baiju.

Now the problem is gradually solved. General Wang Yi has obtained the active help of this "Thousand-Mile Horse" and resolutely led the armed people of Qiongyai. The people are happy to carry the anti-Japanese swords and guns under the leadership of this "Thousand-Mile Horse" and are equally willing to ignite the fire of killing × under the planning of General Wang Yi. At present, the development of guerrilla warfare on Hainan Island has caused extremely widespread unrest and collapse in the rule of the × army. Who can not believe that this is the effect of the specific work achieved by the joint assistance, joint responsibility, joint leadership, and joint development of the Feng and Wang generals?

### Xiamen's Gulangyu Youth Association Under the Mirror: Another Major Base for Cultural Aggression: Many Tricks but No Results

Xiamen, the metropolis of southern Fujian, has changed its beautiful rivers and mountains and its prosperous cities have declined since it was trampled on by the iron hooves of the × people last May. The × people initially wanted to use sharp bayonets to wash away the turbid blood of the Lujiang River, cover up the desolate atmosphere of the Xiamen City, and make this isolated island floating in the sea transform into a beautiful mirage out of thin air to seduce a group of displaced refugees. However, the facts are the fairest witnesses. They shattered the dreams of the × people. The × people, who have always believed in "military power," also felt that relying solely on bayonets and shells was not enough to subdue the people and restore the market. So, a trick came to mind, and they wanted to use the "cultural aggression" tactic to implement a policy of fooling the people and anesthetizing the people, while also concealing the … … According to this strategy, ×× successively established several cultural aggression agencies in Xiamen, including the so-called "Lujiang Youth Association". This thing is placed in front of the mirror, so that readers can see its gloomy and strange appearance.

After the × people invaded Xiamen Island, they were repeatedly attacked by our patriotic youth. Out of anger, they had to admit the "great power of youth". So they tried to win over the youth for their own use. On September 1 last year, the × people, under the pretext of "uniting and harmonizing the youth of Xiamen and cultivating their quality for improvement," prepared to set up the "Lujiang Youth Association," which was responsible by the × chieftain Ze Chongxin and the traitor Shi Fan. They tried to recruit members in many ways, but the general public understood their tricks and refused to join. Therefore, the × pseudo-people worked hard, and after a month of special effort, only traitors and gangsters who maintained the association were recruited. The crowd claimed to have more than 400 people, but in fact, most of the names were privately filled or fabricated by the traitors. At the founding meeting on October 1, the × chieftain appointed Chen ××, Xie ××, Shi ××, and Huang ××, nine traitors, as directors, and Chen ×× as the chairman. Its organization was also divided into six departments: general affairs, community, documents, transportation, members, and accounting. It also set up three departments: moral, intellectual, and physical, each with a director.

After the establishment of the various pseudo-associations, Chen and his ilk, relying on the breath of the × chieftain, constantly carried out activities to whitewash peace. In addition to distributing harmonious rumors and spreading unfounded news to deceive refugees into returning to Xiamen, they also held Japanese language training courses, organized football teams, and held football and bicycle competitions. Recently, in order to directly deceive the refugees stranded in Gulangyu, the pseudo-association specially set up a branch in Gulangyu, which was responsible by Chen ××, and sent staff to various refugee camps to create rumors and provoke them in order to induce them to return to Xiamen. At the same time, it also set up a "Japanese Language Training Institute" in Gulangyu, attempting to buy and manufacture new traitors.

Although the × people have many tricks and the Han women are good at flattery, most of our compatriots stranded in Xiamen and Gulangyu will not be fooled. The result of the × pseudo-half-year of self-promotion is nothing, because Xiamen is still a lonely and desolate Xiamen.

Film and Drama

### The Social Life of Deanna Durbin

Like most American girls her age, Deanna Durbin loves to swim and roller skate. However, she can't go to public skating rinks or beaches. The reason is simple: she's not an ordinary girl, she's a movie star.

Don't misunderstand, those places would never put up signs forbidding movie stars. Movie stars are always welcome, even extra welcome. The real reason she can't go lies with Deanna herself; she doesn't want to go. Why? The reason is even simpler: she's afraid of being surrounded by fans asking for autographs. Really, if she went to those places, wouldn't countless people swarm her? Those people are everywhere, one group leaving and another arriving, not letting her go until it's time for dinner. Movie stars generally feel that being asked for autographs is a sign of their popularity, and they are happy about it. But if she's in the mood for skating, such a commotion completely ruins the afternoon, and it would be the same next time.

Deanna also can't skip rope at parties. What deprives her of this joy is a group of American mothers. Deanna's screen image gives them an impression of purity and innocence. These mothers often use Deanna as an example to admonish their daughters who are engaged in frivolous games, and they write to Deanna to praise her greatly. A movie star who wants to keep her audience shouldn't ignore these letters. Deanna has to restrain her own desire to dance.

Deanna also can't go out alone with a boyfriend, even in the afternoon. She has to prevent malicious publicity, which is more terrible than smallpox. Even though she rarely goes out, a few weeks ago someone spread rumors that she was seen alone with a boyfriend somewhere one night.

Going to a movie with a girlfriend and having an ice cream soda at a street-side snack shop is the best pastime for ordinary girls. But for two reasons, Deanna can't do it. First, she's too busy. Even when she's not filming, she has many things to do, like studying music, trying on new clothes, or taking publicity photos. She's busy all day. Second, even if she had time, it would be too dangerous to go out. Unpleasant things often happen. Sometimes people even follow her home. Like the last time she came back from watching soccer one Saturday afternoon, four boys in a car tried everything they could to make Deanna's car crash into theirs. She was in the car with her father and a girlfriend as bodyguards. It's really too dangerous for her.

No this, no that. Deanna can't enjoy the same pleasures as girls her age. To us, her life seems too monotonous and dull. Yet, it's not as we think. Her social life is three times that of ordinary children, and proportionally, she has three times the fun. "Three times" refers to the three different groups she participates in daily. Ordinary boys and girls usually only interact with their classmates, gathering together, playing games, and engaging in sports. However, Deanna has three such groups.

The first group is the young actors she works with on the movie set, a total of six people. There are three Jacks—Jack Moran, Jack Cooper, and Jack Searl—these are the three boys. And there are three girls: Helen Parrish, Judy Garland, and herself.

The second group is her close friends from her old high school in Los Angeles, a total of more than ten people, both male and female. She almost lost them because, after she became famous in the movies, these old friends felt they were of different social standing and dared not associate with her. But later, they all realized that Deanna was not arrogant or condescending, and they became friends again. According to Deanna, they now treat her as a classmate, which makes her very happy.

The third group is all adults. It includes her directors, producers, and cinematographers, all of whom she works with.

In the first group, the six people take turns hosting dinner and dance parties at each other's homes. They hold them once a week when they have free time from working on the movie set, and once a month when work is busy. Except for special days like someone's birthday, these gatherings are usually on Fridays or Saturdays. In the summer, when it's hot, they cancel the dancing and everyone goes swimming in Deanna's private pool, and they eat outdoors.

Their routine doesn't change much. Some of them are too young to drive, so their fathers are responsible for picking them up and dropping them off. The gatherings also have a set time, from 7:30 PM to 11:30 PM, so that everyone can be in bed before midnight. The boys wear sweaters and trousers, and the girls wear skirts or other comfortable clothes.

During the gatherings, they play the phonograph or radio, and everyone sits around chatting about trivial things, never talking about movies. They're busy with movies all day; why not leave that aside at this time?

The mothers are responsible for the food, usually cheese, meat, or egg sandwiches, Coca-Cola, and some snacks and ice cream. After eating, they wipe their mouths, say goodnight, and go home.

Occasionally, they invite a few—four to six—outside guests to join them, and the food is more lavish. The girls dress up in long gowns, and the boys all wear black suits. But this only happens twice a year.

Deanna and Judy Garland are both singing stars, but they never perform at these gatherings. According to Deanna, that would be a bit disrespectful.

Her parties with her former school friends are roughly the same as described above, except that there is no set date, and they are always held at her house, because no one else has a house big enough to accommodate so many people.

The celebration held at her house after the premiere of Deanna's new movie "First Love" is a good example of her social life with the third group. There were six guests that night, including the film's director, producer, and her agent. After the premiere ended at 11 PM, they went home and talked enthusiastically about the movie they had just seen. Then the adults drank wine, while Deanna toasted everyone with Coca-Cola in place of wine. After dinner, they talked a little longer, and then everyone left happily.

Sometimes the celebration after the premiere of a new movie is held at the director's or producer's house. That's when Deanna has a chance to wear an evening gown, and she likes having those opportunities.

Deanna has gone from "Three Smart Girls" to "First Love." How long can she stay in this kind of social life? I wonder.

### The Pitiful Ranks of Hollywood

A General Ledger of Extra Income

Bette Davis, who once received an honorary award for her acting, wrote an article advising American movie fans not to have too much hope about going to Hollywood unless they can prepare for a year's living expenses. Perhaps this article will disappoint some movie fans, as they might think it is needlessly curbing people's ambitions. However, according to the 1937 statistics from the movie studio actors' employment agency, Miss Bette's advice is based on facts that can be proven. The report states:

The average number of people who find work every day of the year is only eighteen.

The average daily wage earned - $3.03.

The average annual income per person - $187.00

From this, it can be seen that Hollywood doesn't pay extras much. In 1937, a total of 15,936 extras were employed. Among this sea of people, only seven lucky ones had a total annual income exceeding $3,000. In addition, 14,091 people had a total income of less than $500.

So, it's best not to go to Hollywood unless you can live on a meager income of less than $500 a year.

### Xing Hua Team's Third Match in Hong Kong Decided Against Hua Lian Team Second Match Hong Kong Team to Use Its Best Lineup

Matches Scheduled from Today Until Next Wednesday

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The Singaporean Chinese football team has moved from the Philippines to Hong Kong. This Saturday and Sunday, they will play against South China, and on Sunday, they will compete against the Hong Kong General Association team (the team that went to the Philippines). The match on the 5th (next Wednesday) was originally intended to be a joint Singapore-Hong Kong Chinese team against the Navy-Army combined team, which was accepted by both South China and the Navy-Army sports associations. Later, they received replies from both associations stating that they would not be able to field a team at that time. Therefore, it was decided that this final match would be between the Hua Lian team and the Xing Hua team. After South China obtained agreement from all parties, they convened a meeting of representatives yesterday to select the lineup, which is as follows:

Hua Lian Team

Zhang Rongcai (South China South)

Chen Guangyu (Police) Hou Rongsheng (Guanghua)

Li Guowei (South China South) Liang Rongzhao (South China South) Liu Qingcai (South China South)

Hou Chengtang (Oriental) Zhuo Shijin (Guanghua) Chen Dehui (South China South) Li Zhaorong (South China South) Deng Guangsen (South China South)

The Xing Hua team's second match in Hong Kong will be against the Hong Kong General Association team (the team that went to the Philippines). This match is nothing less than a gathering of Hong Kong football heroes, as the Xing Hua team is the champion of the local league for two consecutive years, and the Hong Kong team is the best of the best at the moment. Therefore, this great battle is very important. It has been learned that the Hong Kong team's lineup will be slightly different from the previously planned one and will use its best lineup (i.e., the first team that went to the Philippines) to compete with the Xing Hua team. However, since Liang Rongzhao represented South China in the first match and Hua Lian in the third match, it would be too tiring for him to also play in the second match for the Hong Kong team. Therefore, the Hong Kong team's midfield line will add Yishi Dulanqi. The final lineup is determined as follows:

General Association Team

Tan Junkun (South China)

Shi Han (US Military) Li Tiansheng (South China South)

Yishi Dulanqi (Hong Kong) Liang Rongzhao (South China South) Billotto (Joseph) Feishi Woda (US Military)

Hou Chengtang (Oriental) Gaoshan Nuo (Joseph) Li Huitang (South China South) Feng Jingxiang (South China South) Yanbachen (Military Supplies)

The Xing Hua team has actually brought a total of nineteen people this time. Xin De and Li Yi You were unable to make the trip due to circumstances. The team will allocate the following players for the three matches in Hong Kong. The list is as follows:

Xing Hua Team

Li Botang Feng Huiwen

Ye Maofa Deng Yuehan Chen Kaiwan Sun Chunlai

Ye Tiande Xu Houkun Zhu Chenggui Ji You

Long Liewu Cai Yuehan Xia Zhixiang Xie Qingfu Wen Guanzong He Guocai Li Haizhu Wu Zhan Shi

In the first match against South China, Yang Shui Yi was originally set to be the left wing, and Luo Douwen was not used. Shui Yi is indeed capable of using both feet and has served as the left wing a few times before, but it is only an expedient measure, not a necessary one. Now, facing a strong visiting team, such an arrangement is indeed inappropriate. In this reporter's opinion, it would be better to use Douwen as the left wing, because Shui Yi is not accustomed to taking on this role and may not perform as well as Douwen. Furthermore, Douwen, who originally held this position, was not selected, which is enough to discourage him. This reporter feels compelled to speak out on behalf of Douwen. The South China lineup is as follows:

South China Club

Bao Jiaping

Li Tiansheng Mai Luxian

Li Guowei Liang Rongzhao Liu Qingcai

Luo Douwen Yang Shui Yi Li Zhaorong Li Huitang Feng Jingxiang Deng Guangsen

Reserves: Guo Yingqi Xie Jinhong Chen Dehui

From today until next Wednesday, in addition to the football matches, there will be other important sporting events held each day. Sports fans are truly blessed. List of events for March 29 (Wednesday):

### Looking Back and Forth

— Lai Ruifu

Last Saturday, both South China South and Oriental had crucial external matches that they could not afford to lose. However, the owner of the So Kon Po Stadium, out of concern for the lawn, disregarded the orders of the governing body and the urgency of the friendly team to finish the match and embark on a long expedition. He stubbornly declared that the stadium was not suitable for playing football and refused to allow the matches. This seemed to benefit Oriental, but the sporting spirit seemed a bit "off." Furthermore, some Kowloon Club players, in order to preserve their strength for the Special Silver Shield Competition, had already completely abstained from appearing in the inter-port practice matches. Last Sunday, some of them were selected to represent the Westerners' Li Hua Cup final, but of the five players, only Han Nibo Lu showed up, while the rest were absent. Wu Lie Zhi was injured during the match and could be excused for his absence. However, Belis, George, and Liao Yachen were not injured when the match ended. Apart from a slight discomfort in Zuo Qia's foot, the others were still as lively as tigers and fought hard against South China South. In light of this, it seems that the sporting spirit of the Westerners in Hong Kong is nothing more than this.

South China South defeated Kowloon Club at the Kowloon Stadium, which is a record for this year in Hong Kong. Although Kowloon Club's First Division team's performance this year has not been high, they had maintained an undefeated record on their home turf before that. South China South was missing Feng Jingxiang that day and still gifted them three "goose eggs," breaking their strange record. This is something to be proud of. However, some people said that if Helishiao had not been injured and unable to play, would South China South have been able to defeat them? It is doubtful. If that were the case, then Liang Rongzhao should be given the most credit for South China South's victory that day, as Helishiao's finger was injured when he and Li Huitang switched positions during the international semi-final.

If South China South ultimately wins the league championship, they will have been greatly favored by their younger brother South China and the Oriental Club team. There is naturally no question of repayment between brothers, but they must greatly repay their friend, the Oriental team. Therefore, when they play against the Navy, not only for their own future, but also to repay Oriental, they must decisively defeat the Navy and subdue their arrogant ambitions, so that Oriental will have a guaranteed chance of winning when they compete with them in the runner-up final. This is, of course, after Oriental defeats Midouxi. I see that Oriental is currently sharpening its swords and preparing its armor, and they have a very good chance of defeating Midouxi.

On Sunday, our Hua Lian team had already won two of the six championships. After this, there will be the International Cup, which relies heavily on Hua Lian. Li Huitang will definitely be deployed, and victory seems to be assured. As for the other competitions, such as the League, Special Shield, and Xu He Cup, it all depends on South China Club's strength. South China South's strength is strong, and they seem to be very confident about the League and Special Silver Shield. With the addition of "Chu Feng" to the Xu He Cup, their strength is even greater, and it seems likely that they will sweep everything and usher in a new era for the Hong Kong Chinese football community. However, it is still a flaw to allow Li Huitang, who is registered with South China South, to not be strongly invited to play for them. Judging from the "King of Football's" recent performances, I don't think anyone would dare to say that he is "past his prime." Huitang is a powerhouse who maintains his parent club's strength. If a certain Mr. could be specially invited to say a few words of admiration to him, I guarantee that he would not refuse to play for his parent club. Then the glory of South China winning three championships and the Chinese sweeping all six championships would not be difficult to achieve.

The Singapore Chinese Sporting Advancement Association football team won four of their five matches in the Philippines, greatly enhancing the reputation of the Chinese. Soon, Oriental will have an expedition to Haiphong and Hanoi, and there are also rumors that South China will organize a team to tour the Dutch East Indies and Australia in May or June. I hope that they will all be victorious, first spreading the prestige of China, so that in 1940, it will not be difficult to win the football championship at the Olympic Games and create an unprecedented record. If this is the case, China's international standing will rise another level along with its anti-Japanese war reputation. My sincere wishes.

Yesterday, the Xu brothers lightly defeated the Olympic Zhen and Xia Xian teams in the drizzle. Watching their effortless performance, compared to the Lin Zhen brothers team's match, which was extremely strenuous and only narrowly won, there is a real difference between heaven and earth. This year's lawn tennis will naturally be the "Xu brothers' world" again. It is a pity that such great talents cannot find people to cultivate them. It is truly a great pity. If these two could be sent to Europe and America to learn from each other, I guarantee that they would soon become world-renowned players. The elder Xu is 27 years old and is still in the perfect time to seek advancement. The younger Xu is only 22, and his future is limitless.

### Yesterday's Tennis Match The Xu Brothers Easily Defeat the Olympic Xia Team

Yesterday's All Hong Kong Open Tennis Tournament had three doubles matches scheduled, but only one took place. The match between Da Gaoshan Nuo and Lei Miti against Jili and Bin Nie was postponed, and the pair of Mishina and A Fushu forfeited, allowing Luo Dingxian and Li Qi to win. The Xu brothers' match against the Olympic Zhen and Xia Xian was a one-act play that ended uneventfully. Xia Xian's ankle injury has not yet healed, and he cannot run. Olympic Zhen, although making a strong effort, could not support the building alone and ultimately collapsed with scores of 3-6 and 2-6. Today's match between Li Rurong and He Jialiu against Piasi and Defu has also been postponed. It is said that Defu has gone to Xiao Luzon for business and will not be able to return to Hong Kong until next week.

### Basketball Game Zhong Sheng vs. Pui Ying Tonight in First Division

The public men's basketball tournament is currently underway. Tonight, starting at 6:30 PM, the first game will be between Second Division A Youth Team and Chen Guang. The second game will be a First Division match between Zhong Sheng and Pui Ying. The final game will be between Second Division B Guan Lei and Kang Yuan. The First Division game is extremely exciting. Zhong Sheng is a top-tier team in this area, having recently defeated Xingdao by a score of 38-33 shortly after the start of the season. Pui Ying also has many famous players, and its lineup is no less impressive than the former. The two teams are evenly matched, and the performance is sure to be spectacular.

### South China Seeking Champion To Be Announced Soon

The South China Athletic Association's membership recruitment is scheduled to determine the champion and other rankings on April 3rd at 8 PM. As a result, there are many people paying membership fees every day. In order to facilitate the payment of fees for each recruiter, in addition to collecting fees at the association's office at Jia Shan, starting yesterday, the association's secretary Pan Jiannong will be stationed at the billiards room in the Chinese Bank Building every day from 2 PM to 8 PM to wait for payments. Once the payment is made, the association's official receipt will be issued immediately.

### Oriental Football Team Ready to Launch Li Anna Cannot Accompany Due to Affairs at the Dreamland Dance Hall

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The Oriental Club football team's southern expedition is ready to launch. It has been learned that Li Anna, who was invited to accompany the team, cannot leave his duties at the Dreamland Dance Hall. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Oriental Club, canceling his intention to travel south with the team.

Mr. Li, who is Irish, is the licensee of the dance hall. However, if he leaves Hong Kong for other places, he must find a European licensee to act as his agent in order to comply with Hong Kong regulations. Mr. Li was initially unaware of this and wanted to use Bao Yun (a player from St. Joseph's), who is of Indian nationality, as his agent. Later, when he reported this matter to the police authorities, the police authorities deemed it inappropriate. Therefore, Li had to cancel his intention to travel south with Oriental due to his affairs. (East Wind)

### First Division Football League Oriental's Match Against US Military Postponed Again

Originally Scheduled for This Afternoon, Now Changed to This Friday Shanghai Generals Cao Qiuting and Xu Wenkui Arrive in Hong Kong to Help

The First Division Football League, Oriental Club's final match against Midouxi, which was originally scheduled for last Saturday, was changed to this afternoon at 5 PM at So Kon Po Stadium due to rain. However, yesterday morning, the Army Sports Department sent a letter to the Football Association stating that the US military was unable to send a team to compete this afternoon due to busy spring training and requested that the match be postponed to Friday afternoon at 5 PM. After receiving the letter, the Football Association obtained the consent of the Oriental Club and accepted the Army Sports Department's request to postpone the match. Furthermore, according to an Oriental Club representative, Shanghai football stars Cao Qiuting and Xu Wenkui arrived in Hong Kong yesterday to participate in the southern expedition. The two may help in the match against the US military this Friday.

### Welcome to Singapore Football Teammates (2)

— Li Huitang

What I said above about "coming from distinguished families" is not entirely unfounded. According to what I have heard and seen, there have been countless outstanding Chinese football players produced in Singapore in recent years, no less than those in Hong Kong and Shanghai. There are also countless exceptional talents among them. Let me introduce a few "special products" to enlighten football fans.

(1) The most reputable player in the last decade or so is undoubtedly center forward Lim Wan Leong. His performance in Hong Kong in 1928 was incredibly brilliant, said to be comparable to the famous Da Gao Shan Nu, which is no exaggeration. Moreover, his golden age had already passed, and we regret not seeing the peak of his artistry. To this day, he is still regarded as a model center forward in the South Seas Islands. Back then, his captivating artistry led to him being hired to participate in battles in Batavia. Currently, many of the rising stars in Singapore are his proud disciples.

(2) The name Tse King Fook is probably somewhat familiar to domestic football fans. He possesses a naturally magnificent physique, shoots with great force, and is particularly skilled at headers. He has performed domestically several times and has been highly praised. In recent years, no one in Malaya surpasses him as a center forward. He once played for South China in the Philippines during their return trip in 1932. This comeback is sure to feature wonderful dribbling and shooting "scenes" that will be reflected on Mount Jia.

(3) Tsai Man Lai, the famous Singaporean center back, was already valued by fans during his first performance in Hong Kong. It was said that his artistry was comparable to that of Lam Yuk Ying. He has represented Singapore in inter-city games for many years. Although he had declined by the time of the 1936 Berlin Olympics, he was still selected as our national representative, which shows how skilled he was during his golden age. Unfortunately, he retired after returning from the Olympics.

(4) Although Hsu Ah Fui played many games domestically, he is a genuine Singaporean product. He also rose to fame in Singapore and was selected as an inter-city representative in 1930. I believe fans in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangdong are all familiar with his strengths, so I don't need to elaborate.

(5) Cheng Kwai Leung, who just left South China last year to return to Singapore, is, like Hsu Ah Fui, a native Singaporean whose name is well-known throughout the country. Since joining South China in 1932, his reputation has grown steadily. He is a rare all-around offensive and defensive player in the football world. It is a great pity that he could not return to Hong Kong with the team for sightseeing this time.

### Lingering Memories of Huanghua

— Huang Sheng

In Guangzhou, I always had special, complex feelings during the Huanghua Festival. On that day, sometimes at dawn, I would join a team and go to the Huanghuagang Mausoleum of the Martyrs to pay solemn respects.

Huanghuagang is located in the suburbs of Guangzhou. I would often stroll there during holidays. The quiet and solemn atmosphere would calm one's mind like slowly flowing water, silently sending respect to the spirits of the martyrs in heaven.

But on the festival, I couldn't maintain any leisurely thoughts. On the way, I would feel somewhat anxious, feeling that the road to the martyrs' tomb was too long. I wished I could immediately reach there to express my reverence for the martyrs, but I could only complain that human legs were not useful enough. Moreover, I had to follow the team, and my legs were somewhat restricted. On the left and right were other teams, brothers in full uniform and crowds with linked hands. Squeezing and crowding, if we turned from the main road to a small lane, the progress would be even slower, and I would feel even more anxious.

In March, there would often be some light spring rain. On the festival, heaven often wished to express its mourning for the martyrs with torrential rain. After raining at night, the road would be muddy in the morning, making it difficult for the teams to walk. If heaven intended to test the sincerity of us survivors' respect for the martyrs, it would first wet people's clothes with drizzle and then pour heavy rain on them as the teams from all directions moved forward. The teams would continue to advance, and everyone understood heaven's intentions.

A small lantern with a white background and blue characters hung on the roadside lamppost, along with two paper Party flags. They were all hung up the day before and had been weathered, peeling, broken, and dripping blue tears! Turning to Dongsha Road, there was a simple archway erected, and the team passed through the middle, entering an even more solemn and tragic environment. Teams returning from the tomb passed by, reminiscing about the martyrs. Many people wanted to be the first to make a dawn sacrifice.

On both sides of the tomb path, large, pale yellow flowers were in full bloom, adorned with transparent water droplets. They were bright and pure, but no one would appreciate them as ordinary flowers. They were so faint, clearly containing a hint of sorrow. In fact, memorial music was already being played, and no one would have a relaxed mood. The footsteps of the team were tight and low, showing that everyone was nervous and wanted to get there quickly, but also wanted to be solemn, and the footsteps should not be too loud.

Wreaths and flower baskets were arranged in front of the tomb, and the Statue of Liberty stood tall there. On both sides of the archway, the couplet "Mausoleum in March, souls return" was present every year. After several teams gathered, a memorial ceremony would be held. The ceremony was simple, with teams of soldiers, workers, merchants, and students arriving one after another. On this day, everyone felt particularly nervous and solemn when standing in front of the martyrs' tomb.

Besides the teams, there were also individuals who came to pay tribute. Some wore a blue cloth diagonally across their bodies with the words "Martyr's Family" written on it. They were probably brothers, wives, children, or other relatives of some martyr. They were all dressed in black cloth clothes and barefoot, without shoes. They were all rural men and women. Our martyrs came from the people and participated in the revolution with a pure sense of nationhood. The martyrs sacrificed themselves for righteousness, and their families did not ask for any special treatment, only using the blue cloth to let people recognize them.

This year's Huanghua Festival, the martyrs' tombs are in the hands of the enemy, and the hometowns of most of the martyrs are also in the hands of the XX. Besides continuing the spirit of the martyrs and working hard, what else can be said!

### Chen Liang's Theory of Recovering Lost Territory

— Jie

——Historical Reading Notes——

Historical documents can be considered the most valuable legacy left by predecessors to future generations. These documents are not merely antiques for future generations to admire and sigh over, but the crystallization of the experiences of our predecessors, providing future generations with extremely profound lessons. For example, the speeches delivered by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek after the War of Resistance have not only extremely important significance at present, but also an indelible value in history even after hundreds or thousands of years. Here, I am preparing to introduce an important historical document, namely Chen Liang's "Proposal for Recovery," which was presented to Emperor Xiaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty.

Chen Liang was a native of Wuzhou in the early Southern Song Dynasty. He was born when the Song Dynasty was suffering from the invasion of the Jin people. Most of the area north of the Yangtze River had fallen into the hands of the enemy. The emperors of the Southern Song Dynasty listened to the peace proposals of several treacherous ministers and only knew how to seek temporary safety and do nothing, without any ambition to recover the lost territory. Therefore, Chen Liang submitted memorials four times to Emperor Xiaozong of the Song Dynasty, requesting him to be diligent in governing the country in order to revive the nation, and requesting him to send troops to conquer the Jin people in order to recover the lost territory. The text was tens of thousands of words long, indeed a rare and extraordinary work throughout the ages!

The main points of the full text can be roughly divided into three layers. The first layer explains the benefits of resisting the war and the disadvantages of negotiating peace. Why should we resist the war? Because we want to save the suffering people in the occupied areas, we want to wash away the shame suffered by the country, we want to return the coffins of Emperors Huizong and Qinzong, and we want to recover the lost territory. Chen Liang's original words were: "The people are crying without anyone to tell, we cannot not save them; the humiliation of the country being invaded, we cannot not wipe it away; the mausoleums cannot not be returned; the territory cannot not be recovered." Because of these four "cannot not" reasons, we must resist the war. Chen Liang also believed that if we do not recover the lost territory as soon as possible, then after a long time, we may not have the hope of recovering it! He said: "It has been a long time since the Southern Crossing, the elders in the Central Plains are dying every day, and those who grew up in Rong (Jin) territory, how would they know that we exist?" This means: "Now, the compatriots in the occupied areas still know how to miss the motherland; in the future, when the younger generation grows up, I am afraid that they will be subjected to the enemy's enslavement education and will never think of the country again." How reasonable this statement is! Just look at the present, aren't there many Taiwanese soldiers attacking their ancestral country? Chen Liang also cited a wonderful metaphor, he said: "To explain it in vulgar terms, if the father and grandfather pawned property to others, and the children and grandchildren cannot continue it, after another ten years, the situation changes, and they all plead with the officials, claiming it as their ancestral property. How can I say that I will redeem it after pawning it? Then, can the matter of today (i.e., recovering lost territory) be delayed any longer?" This metaphor is so accurate. Just look at Korea and Taiwan, which were originally our country's territory, but have been lost for decades. No country in the international community recognizes them as Chinese territory anymore. Chinese geography textbooks also no longer include Korea and Taiwan in the country's territory. From this point of view, our Northeastern Provinces should be recovered as soon as possible, and no more delay is allowed!

The second layer discusses the terrain of offense and defense, and he believes that the southeastern corner is not reliable and that we must strive for the area of Jingxiang. The third layer is about those scholars who specialize in "nature and principle," who are impractical and out of touch with the times. He said, "Today's scholars who consider themselves to be those who have obtained the study of rectifying the heart and purifying the intention are all numb and do not know the pain. They allow the hatred of the ruler and father to exist in the world and bow their heads and talk about life and destiny. They do not know what life and destiny are!" This scolding is so refreshing! Therefore, Zhu Xi at that time also believed that Chen Liang's remarks were "heretical." However, in all fairness, although Neo-Confucianism does not help the war of resistance, it is still a norm for personal cultivation. During the current war of resistance, some people are still selling erotic articles for money, which is enough to write a sentence: "A numb and unknowing person."

### Migration

— Xinghuo

Life of a Journalist in the Guerrilla Zone

The summer's sudden rain was hitting the awning, the rain was too dense, and the cabin was filling with water. In order to protect the wireless electrical equipment that could not get wet, we used our own bodies to shield them, forgetting the wetness on our backs.

Thunder rumbled, and the rain fell harder and harder. Our boat struggled in the center of the river; the wind blocked us from moving forward, as the boatman desperately rowed the oars.

Everywhere was water. The mulberry trees that had been harvested for leaves only revealed short tips on the surface of the water. Everywhere there was the sound of "Yi Ya, Ga, Ga, Ga..." of the waterwheels, and the farmers had to use their last bit of strength in despair.

Arriving at a village, the boat was propped towards the shore. With a "scrape" sound, the boat could no longer be propped, and it turned out that it had been propped onto the shore.

Rolling up our pants, we stepped into the water, and entering the house, the water still submerged our heels. Later, we finally managed to settle down in a relatively dry family's house. We began to move things; in an empty room, we put down the planks, and then put down a few tables, which we arranged into our "newspaper office."

In the village, we, the four or five uninvited guests, attracted the attention of many people, and our door was often surrounded by people watching the excitement.

When we raised the radio antenna high to the branches of the cypress tree, the surprised eyes were even more focused on us.

Listening to the radio, the tunes of operas broke the silent air in the countryside.

"Oh, this thing is available in the cloth shops in town"! The farmers gathered to listen, and many people boasted about their knowledge in unison.

In order to record, we got up every midnight, and the radio constantly emitted "Mandarin" that the farmers could not understand. In this way, in their eyes, we became even more mysterious figures.

After several surprises, they began to have a fearful concept of us. When they saw us, they always avoided us from a distance, and even the children were not allowed to enter the house where we lived.

We began to look for opportunities to explain our actions to the honest and simple farmers; at the same time, we gradually carried out the work of instilling ideas.

It was the height of summer. In the evening, the farmers came back from their work in the fields, holding a bowl of thin porridge, with a few fried broad beans on the surface, and went to the "rice field" in front of the door to enjoy the cool. While eating porridge, they began to chat about family matters and local gossip, passing the twilight time.

The moonlight shrouded the open field with a layer of tulle, and the frogs on the edge of the field were croaking. We sat on their side, listening quietly.

Targeting what they said, we seized the opportunity, we talked about bombs, airplanes, divine soldiers, immortals... to why the XX wanted to attack China, and then talked about why we couldn't farm well and live our lives, and even talked about how they could drive the devils out... This is where we explained why we came to the countryside.

We spoke more and more, and we removed the barriers with them. After living for a few more days, the farmers had regarded us as friends, and often came to our house to ask about this and talk about that, and the farmers' attitude towards us had changed from fear to intimacy. When we needed some tea or borrowed some utensils, they rushed to send them over.

"Use them, sir, we have more!" They were so sincere and generous.

But after living in this "old home," we had to prepare to migrate. Because the shadow of the devil's claws was always flashing over our heads.

"Tomorrow, we're leaving!" Under the moonlight, we looked at those simple and sincere faces.

"Isn't it good to live here?" A surge of enthusiasm poured into our hearts from this simple question.

"It is good, but we have lived here for too long, and it may not be very convenient for you!"

"What's the matter with that, anyway, you have comfortable homes and came out to work, so what do we have!"

We looked silently at the people who were enjoying the cool around us, their eyes were all focused on us, expressing a questioning expression.

Failing to live up to their enthusiasm, we packed up our things the next day. At this time, our house was full of people, from children to old women, from old men to young men.

They had already moved those heavy things down to the boat first; the boat was rowed by the farmers who automatically stopped working in the fields for us.

"Come and play, gentlemen:" Our boat set sail, and the shore was full of people standing "seeing us off." From each other's gaze, we could see the mutual feelings of reluctance.

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

When excitement reaches its end, if it's not madness, then it's confusion. Emotion has already changed its quality at this point. At this moment, she was just like this.

She was also looking ahead. What she saw, what she thought about, was entirely the abyss of misfortune and death. She was heading towards that place. So, she couldn't help but stop and shout...

"I'm not going!"

This voice brought his nerves back to normal. With a sense of success, he couldn't help but laugh inwardly:

"Cowardly child, let me tell you, it's too late. It's all too late. When you were at home, why did you let go of the good opportunity?"

Then he thought again:

"If you really stop on the road and don't go now... as long as you go!"

As a result, she was still forced to obey his pistol, still letting her steps betray her destination. She kept looking steadily, getting closer and closer! The abyss of misfortune and death that she saw and thought about. Without realizing it, the collar of her clothes slipped to her shoulders, her teeth bit through her lips, and she began to sigh. In that sigh, which forgot her sorrow, she was simply saying that this was the last journey of life forced upon her. The weak are the hardest to escape, the most sorrowful, and this road is the hardest to walk--even if the execution ground is paved with velvet-like carpets, even if the road to the guillotine is made of marble; unless one is a strong person, or a martyr, still forgets their own misfortune, and still cheers.
