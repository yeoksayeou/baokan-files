### Temporary Suspension of Customs Tax Repayment: The Issue of Guaranteed Debt

Since the start of the full-scale War of Resistance, for the past year and a half, our government, amidst extreme hardship and suffering, has been able to maintain the unified support of the entire nation and enhance our international standing. This is not only due to its political acumen in uniting the nation to persevere in the great cause of resistance and nation-building, but also because of its economic prowess in aligning with the needs of resistance domestically and responding to the international situation externally, carefully formulating and resolutely executing its correct policies. We are immensely grateful for the patriotic dedication of domestic financial and economic leaders, their loyalty to their mission, and the international allies who uphold justice and offer sympathy and assistance. Furthermore, we cannot help but express our admiration for the Chinese government's meticulous planning and comprehensive responsibility, demonstrating great credibility both at home and abroad, especially in maintaining creditworthiness, which has won universal respect. Conversely, the Japanese authorities are internally draining resources to the point of exhaustion, causing widespread resentment, and externally engaging in deceitful acquisition and forceful seizure, arousing global opposition. The two are simply not comparable.

Since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang in 1931, especially after the establishment of the puppet state of Manchuria, Japan's military aggression and economic invasion against China have advanced in tandem, reinforcing each other. Armed smuggling undermines our tax revenue, and military seizure occupies our customs, directly disrupting the business operations of Chinese and foreign industries and indirectly creating significant difficulties for our efforts to repay foreign debts. This is a well-known fact both domestically and internationally. Fortunately, our responsible authorities have overcome all obstacles and made sacrifices to prioritize the maintenance of creditworthiness. Especially in the last dozen or so months, as the coastline has been blockaded by the Japanese navy, and major customs offices have successively fallen under the control of Japanese military seizure and occupation, our creditworthiness has remained unshaken. Considering the financial history of various countries during wartime in modern times, this can truly be called China's greatest honor. However, our glory is intolerable to the Japanese, and the enormous customs revenue is the object of their insatiable greed. Therefore, the occupation of customs revenue in the three northeastern provinces is not enough; they continue to seize customs offices in Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, Longkou, Qingdao, and other places. The occupation of customs revenue in North China is not enough; they are scheming to seize all customs offices in Central and South China. Fearing they cannot escape universal condemnation and punishment, they initiated the North China-Shanghai customs talks in May of last year, leading to the establishment of the so-called Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement, which harms our national sovereignty. At that time, our responsible authorities made solemn statements against this illegal agreement, and all knowledgeable individuals, especially in the financial community, unanimously opposed it. Since the establishment of the agreement, Japanese actions have become even more outrageous. All important customs revenues along our coast and in war zones have been forcibly seized. Moreover, the seized tax revenues are not handed over to the Inspectorate General of Customs according to law, but are transferred to banks established by the Japanese, intending to use them to continue their invasion of China and expand their influence in the Far East. Their infringement on the rights of friendly nations is self-evident, and this is also a fact seen by all at home and abroad. In light of the evolution of the situation, our government, from the standpoint of national interest, cannot continue to tolerate this and continue to advance funds for repaying all debts guaranteed by customs revenue. From the standpoint of international credibility, our friendly nations will surely express sympathy for our situation and attitude and will not allow Japan to continue its deceitful acquisition and forceful seizure to expand its influence in the Far East. Therefore, on the 15th of this month, a notice was issued, reiterating the government's determination to maintain creditworthiness, severely condemning Japan's illegal actions of invading the rights of friendly nations, and declaring that the Chinese government is compelled to implement newly established measures, temporarily suspending the advancement of funds for repaying all debts guaranteed by our customs revenue.

Since the announcement of this new measure by the Ministry of Finance, both at home and abroad have paid attention. Our righteous and stern words and the Japanese side's outrageous and illegal actions have won the sympathy of international public opinion and criticism of Japan. However, Japanese and Chinese traitors have taken the opportunity to create rumors and incite unrest, causing confusion and noise. According to Reuters, some in Shanghai's banking community are even advocating for the recognition of the so-called Customs Revenue Deposit Agreement signed by Britain and Japan last May. Considering the past performance of Shanghai's banking community, we express great doubt about this news. What must be clarified is that the so-called Anglo-Japanese Customs Revenue Deposit Agreement not only clearly harms our national sovereignty and has long been unanimously criticized by public opinion at home and abroad, but it is also a smokescreen used by Japan to openly seize our customs revenue to promote its non-development in the Far East. It should be intolerable to righteous people at home and abroad and is contrary to the security of the rights of friendly nations in China. If such a unilateral agreement can be recognized, then Japan's illegal actions of seizing customs revenue can be considered legal. This point should be clearly understood by all wise individuals. Whether for the sake of our national interest or for safeguarding the rights of friendly nations in China, this illegal agreement should not be recognized, regardless of any pretext. The Ministry of Finance's notice on the 15th clearly points this out and should not only be supported by the entire nation but also be sympathized with and understood by our friendly nations.

Furthermore, the method of temporarily suspending the advancement of funds for repaying debts guaranteed by customs revenue, as announced in the Ministry of Finance's notice on the 15th, is limited to debts guaranteed by customs revenue in its scope. In terms of its content, the total principal amount of these long-term debts guaranteed by customs revenue, calculated at the legal exchange rate, is approximately 2.5 billion national currency units, including approximately 600 million in foreign currency loans, approximately 100 million in Boxer Indemnity payments, and approximately 1.8 billion in national currency loans. The amount due for repayment in the 26th year of the Republic (1937) is approximately 4 million national currency units under foreign currency items, approximately 3 million national currency units under Boxer Indemnity items, and approximately 11 million national currency units under national currency loan items, totaling approximately 18 million national currency units per month. The portion of the Boxer Indemnity owed to Britain and the United States will be fully repaid by the 35th year of the Republic (1946), and the amount due for monthly repayment will gradually decrease compared to the current monthly amount. From this, we can understand that: (1) The new measures announced by the Ministry of Finance this time are purely a last resort due to the fact that customs revenue in the war zones has been seized by the Japanese, precisely to demonstrate the Chinese government's solemn attitude towards maintaining creditworthiness. The original text of the notice clearly stated: "In the future, for all long-term debts guaranteed by customs revenue that were contracted before the war and have not yet been repaid, the amount that should be apportioned from customs revenue in the war zones will be transferred to a special account in the Central Bank on a regular basis. However, this method of apportionment is a temporary measure to cope with the current extraordinary circumstances. If the customs offices in the war zones hand over the outstanding debt and indemnity payments that have been apportioned, as well as the amount that should be apportioned from future tax revenue, to the Inspectorate General of Customs as before, the government will naturally simultaneously allocate the debt and indemnity funds as before to restore the previous situation." Judging from this text, our country's attitude of respecting creditworthiness and impartiality should be understood by all friendly nations. (2) The new measures of the Ministry of Finance not only have no impact on our country's past efforts to maintain creditworthiness but precisely demonstrate respect for the rights of our friendly nations in China, to urge these friendly nations to cooperate closely with us. We deeply hope that all friendly nations, especially Britain, the United States, and France, should immediately unite and protest against Japan's illegal actions of infringing on creditor rights, urge it to respect the interests of third countries in China, and use effective measures such as economic sanctions as a backing for their protests. If Japan's ambition to monopolize China is not crushed and China's customs sovereignty does not achieve independence and integrity, there can be no talk of equal opportunity, which is a tragic fact since the "September 18th Incident" and has long been witnessed by all at home and abroad. Reading the Reuters dispatch from London on the 19th, "British business circles unanimously praised the Chinese Ministry of Finance's notice, and all Chinese bonds rebounded," shows that justice prevails and cannot be distorted.

Finally, we deeply hope that all sectors of the country, adhering to the principle that "everyone is responsible for the fate of the nation," especially at this critical juncture in the success or failure of the War of Resistance, should internally and externally enhance the self-esteem and self-confidence of our Chinese nation and promote the great spirit of unity and determination to strive for independence and freedom? Internally, to inspire the soldiers, and externally, to encourage friendly nations, concentrating all forces to overcome the final difficulties. If everyone can encourage themselves and others with this, and the whole world shares the same hatred for the enemy, jointly resisting the brutal enemy, then what worries are there about the obstacles to the future of the War of Resistance!

### Research on Resistance Tactics and the Crucial Task of Improvement (Part 1)

— Chiang Kai-shek

1. The most important task of staff officers is to understand the enemy's situation, inspire hatred for the enemy, and maximize the combat effectiveness of our army.

2. The tactics used by the enemy and the methods our army should use to counter them:

   1.  Since the enemy relies solely on superior weapons to attack us, our army should find ways to render their superior weapons ineffective.
   2.  Since the enemy seeks to defeat us individually, cut off our army's connections, and strike at our army's and people's morale, our army should cooperate closely, maintain close contact, and strengthen morale.
   3.  Since the enemy seeks to preemptively strike and put us on the defensive, our army should be proactive everywhere, launching unexpected attacks and striking at their unpreparedness.

3. We should find ways to break the enemy's "wedge-shaped assault" tactic.

4. "Flanking attacks" are the tactic most feared by "wedge-shaped assaults." The key elements are:

   1.  A significant reserve force must be controlled in a standby position.
   2.  The front-line position must be stable and enduring.
   3.  The deployment of positions should be based on manpower, and the use of manpower should not be limited by terrain.

5. Necessary conditions for employing flanking tactics:

   1.  The senior commander should have unwavering determination.
   2.  Emphasis should be placed on cultivating the mobility and teamwork of the troops.
   3.  Strive for proactivity.

6. Crucial tasks for future troop improvement:

   1. Treat prisoners of war well and reward the confiscation and preservation of spoils of war...
   2. Orders must be thoroughly implemented and supervised...
   3. Emphasize messenger and communication education, and block information...
   4. Study weapon performance and refine usage techniques...
   5. Strive for accurate intelligence, careful planning, and eliminate the bad habit of embellishing war situations and falsely reporting victories...
   6. Pay attention to the storage and inspection of warehouse food and ammunition?...
   7. Pay attention to preserving old military uniforms...
   8. Take care of mules and horses.

7. Conduct thorough research on the orders from superiors and my repeated speeches, and strive to implement them.

8. I hope everyone will endure hardship, know shame, and rise up with the determination to die, to strive for national independence and ethnic survival!

Before today's speech, I want to report a piece of news. Recently, a journalist returned from Shanghai. On the ship from Shanghai to Hong Kong, he met a Japanese friend—a journalist from the Osaka Asahi Shimbun. In their conversation, the Japanese journalist talked about his feelings about his own country's army. He said: "Although the Japanese army has the upper hand in this operation, the essence of the army has deteriorated and cannot be saved. Whether in Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, or Hangzhou, the discipline of Japanese officers and soldiers is extremely poor. When they see women, regardless of age, they commit rape at will. After rape, they brutally kill them. When they encounter strong men, they kill them all without exception. All kinds of cruel acts are completely inhuman! When they arrive in a town, they loot at will. After stealing things, they burn down houses! The higher-ups follow suit, and there is no way to restrain them. This is truly the biggest hidden concern for the Japanese government!" This piece of information, seen by the Japanese journalist himself, tells us that wherever the Japanese army goes, they rape, loot, burn, and kill, doing everything possible. It is truly inhumane, and the world is plunged into darkness! The Japanese government is unable to control such a dehumanized, beast-like army. They originally wanted to transfer the reserve forces stationed in China back to their own country and replace them with a batch of active-duty troops to China, but they are afraid that the new troops will change their military discipline, and if the deteriorated troops are transferred back, not only will social order be disrupted, but political rebellions will also be triggered, such as the "February 26th Incident," the act of assassinating the prime minister and surrounding the imperial palace. From this, we can see that Japan is now trapped in a dangerous situation where they cannot advance or retreat. The state of their army's discipline has deeply frightened their government and people. If we can persevere in the War of Resistance, Japan will inevitably collapse from within! After listening to this news, knowing the internal corruption of the seemingly strong Japan, when you return to the troops, you must tell all the officers and soldiers and people everywhere, enhance their self-confidence, inspire their hatred of the enemy, and let them know that the Japanese army not only kills, but also rapes after killing; not only robs, but also burns houses after robbing. Being so inhuman and inhumane, all Chinese people, whether military or civilian, must see the Japanese army as jackals and beasts. If we do not eliminate them, we cannot protect the safety of our compatriots' lives and property. If we do not eliminate them, we cannot guarantee the survival of our country and nation. The most important task for our staff is to understand the enemy's situation, inspire hatred of the enemy in our subordinates and the people, strengthen the fighting will of the military and civilians, and maximize the fighting capacity of the military and civilians! Especially before each order to attack, give a moral speech to the troops, telling all the officers and soldiers the truth about the enemy's situation, conveying the spirit and determination of our senior commanders to the lowest level of soldiers, making sure to generate a strong hatred of the enemy, and not willing to stop until all the Japanese are killed! Only in this way can we defeat Japan!

Now I will talk about the tactics to counter the enemy. First of all, we must know what advantages the Japanese have in their tactics. Last time, we intercepted a Japanese document, which stated that the Japanese army possessed superior weapons, making horizontal and straight breakthroughs, without needing to make contact, as long as they occupied a stronghold, our army would not dare to counterattack. This is the first tactic they admit to being good at. Secondly, they believe that our army's advantages are, first, the strong morale of the military and civilians; and second, the large number of troops. Therefore, they determined their tactics. The first is to strike at the vigorous morale of our military and civilians; the second is to carry out piecemeal defeats; and the third is to put our army in a passive position, use their superior weapons, and adopt a fierce offensive. They want to strike first everywhere, even with one soldier and one gun, they must attack, so that our army is frightened and disheartened, and eliminates our army's will to fight. The Japanese's judgment of our army's situation and the tactics they adopt are like this, so we will use this as a basis to study the methods to counter the enemy. First, the Japanese army relies on superior weapons, and we must find ways to make them consume a large amount and not be effective. Second, they want to strike at the exuberant morale of our military and civilians, so we must step up wartime troop organization and training, vigorously promote political propaganda to the masses, and especially rectify the sanitation, rescue, transportation, and communication work in the war zone and rear, maintain the strong morale of the military and civilians in the War of Resistance, and promote the revolutionary power of our military and civilians to seize the upper hand and suppress the Japanese's violent arrogance. Third, they want to carry out piecemeal defeats against our army, causing our entire army to lose contact, so we must vigorously implement coordinated action tactics, maintain close contact, and carry out a strategic all-out War of Resistance. His tactics, even one soldier and one gun, will attack us, so we must find ways to stop him, eliminate him, and strike him so that not one soldier or one gun can survive! Fourth, he wants to preemptively strike and put us in a passive position. We must stand firmly in an active position, closely monitor the Japanese's activities, attack them unexpectedly, attack their unpreparedness, and force the enemy to cut off and annihilate! From the more than half a year of the War of Resistance, observing the various tactics used by the Japanese, from the perspective of their obvious characteristics, we can summarize and call them "wedge-shaped assaults." The conventional technique of central breakthroughs they use is also a tactic of gathering the main force to carry out a wedge-shaped assault. This is the traditional education in their combat training. Since we know that he habitually uses the wedge-shaped assault tactic, we must find a way to break it. After breaking this habit, he will no longer be able to control us and will be controlled by us! The only key to studying tactics for you is to find the longest and most important trick of the Japanese, study it, set up various possible situations, formulate various effective plans, take them to train the troops, and pay attention to field exercises, using them skillfully, and be sure to thwart their strengths and attack their weaknesses to win the certainty of victory.

The most appropriate way for us to break the Japanese army's "wedge-shaped assault" tactic is to use "flanking attacks." The key elements of flanking attacks: First, it is necessary to control a considerable number of reserve troops and place them in a standby position. In a suitable location on the direction of the Japanese army's advance and the necessary road, make careful preparations. When the enemy carries out a wedge-shaped assault, our reserve forces will move forcefully to the enemy's flank and rear, and launch a flanking attack, especially paying attention to shooting, attacking from the side. This kind of flanking attack is the most effective way to subdue the "wedge-shaped assault." Our past failures were because we did not know how to use this tactic. Commanders at all levels did not control reserve forces for flanking attacks, but only knew that the Japanese were attacking from where, so they only responded to the attack there. When he breaks through a point, our entire line retreats. If we control a considerable reserve force in a suitable standby location, when the front is attacked by the Japanese wedge-shaped assault, we will use the reserve force to take advantage of the situation to launch a flanking attack, cut off his front and rear connections, cut off his support, and shake his morale. His wedge-shaped assault and central breakthrough techniques will not be able to succeed! First, the face position must be stable and durable, so that the flanking attack troops have ample time for movement and combat. Moreover, the longer the front line is held, the more easily the weaknesses of the Japanese A are exposed, and the more opportunities we have to flank, the easier it is to achieve the effect of the attack! If we want the face line to be stable and durable, we must hold the important support points, build solid positions on all sides, and prepare sufficient ammunition and rations as a long-term defense plan, even if the Japanese army uses tactics of outflanking or flanking attacks to attack our army, we can also resist the war from all sides, so that the Japanese cannot attack. If we want to hold the support points firmly, we must also have strict combat discipline. Without orders, even one soldier and one gun must hold on and not retreat. This all depends on our officers being able to inspire hatred of the enemy in their subordinates, so that each officer has the determination to not stop until he swallows up the Japanese. If our face position can hold firm, then we can exert the effectiveness of the flanking attack and break the Japanese "wedge-shaped assault" tactic!

There is another point that we must pay special attention to in order to break the Japanese army's "wedge-shaped assault" tactic, which is that the selection of positions and the layout of positions should be based on the number of troops. That is, the position should be arranged according to the actual number of our troops. Do not allocate troops according to the terrain, so as not to limit the use of troops due to the terrain. I hope everyone will firmly remember these few words and do them conscientiously! The defensive works we have built in the past were all built according to the terrain and the number of troops, resulting in a wide face and dispersed troops, so it was difficult to hold firm. In the future, we must determine the width of the face of the position according to the number of troops. In other words, how many troops can defend how much position. It is better to temporarily abandon places where troops cannot be deployed, and the positions that should be defended must be defended to the death and not allowed to be retreated from casually. As for the allocation of troops, there is another principle that everyone should pay attention to, that is, for any face or support point that has been decided to be defended, no matter how small it is, it must be defended by a relatively small number of strong troops, equipped with sufficient weapons, ammunition and rations, and build various face and side positions to defend on all sides, and control the main force of our army in a standby position on the side, specializing in flank and rear attacks. When the Japanese army passes by our side position, launch a surprise attack, or wait for the Japanese to forcefully attack our face position, and the entire army will attack. In short, the only key to breaking the Japanese army's "wedge-shaped assault" is to firmly defend the face and launch a fierce attack on the side, and all troop allocations, position selections, and construction of works.

The tactics mentioned above to resist the Japanese wedge-shaped assault are just a brief explanation. Everyone must go back and study more and practice more so that the entire army up and down can understand the Japanese's conventional techniques and have the ability to break the Japanese army's conventional techniques. If we want to turn defeat into victory in the future, we must start with skillfully using this tactic! (To be continued)

### Fierce Battle Between China and Japan in Southwestern Shanxi, Japanese Sweeping Along River Crossings, Our Army Advances to 40 Li South of Linfen

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an on the 18th by Our Newspaper] The Japanese in southwestern Shanxi are still guarding strongholds along the Tongpu Railway and various highways, and are harassing river crossings with cavalry and artillery at any time. Currently, there are constant fierce battles near Hejin, Daning, Puxian, Xiangning, Jishan, Wanquan, Xinjiang, Fencheng, Linfen, Xiangling, Wenxi, Xiaxian, and Quwo. Our forces once recovered Zhaoqu, pressed towards Linfen, and once attacked Anyi. Both sides are now reinforcing, and a major decisive battle will take place within days.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing on the 18th by Our Newspaper] On the 17th, our army recovered Zhaoqu Station, an important location on the southern section of the Tongpu Railway, and the main force advanced to 40 li south of Linfen, besieging Shicun.

[Dispatch from Chongqing on the 18th by Reuters] A military spokesperson said today that according to observations, the Japanese army is very active in the West River area of Guangdong, with the intention of invading Zhaoqing. If the Japanese army occupies this city, they can advance to Guangxi Province. However, the Chinese military leaders are also very clear about this, so they have sent reinforcements to guard the city. It is also reported that the Japanese army will also take an offensive in northern Guangdong. Since the Japanese army occupied Xinjie, they can advance to Juntian and Huaxian. Therefore, extremely fierce battles have broken out near Conghua.

Increased Japanese Warships in Beihai, Residents Evacuate Lianbei

(News from Our Port) Since the Japanese have actively invaded the South, Beihai City, because it is located on the Tokyo Gulf and can advance west into the interior of Nanning, Guangxi, has become a zone where Japanese aircraft appear. In the past two months, Beihai City, Lianzhou City, and other places have been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, injuring civilians and destroying many houses. Fortunately, the local churches and the Hepu Refugee Relief Association have tried their best to accommodate and rescue them, so that innocent refugees will not be displaced. However, the original financial resources are limited and cannot be sustained. Recently, Japanese warships have gathered, and the number of Japanese warships suddenly increased by more than 20 ships on the Beihai sea, with a high probability of landing. The residents of Lianbei urgently need to be evacuated to the interior to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Huang Weiyu, the magistrate of Hepu County and chairman of the Refugee Relief Association, has specially dispatched Committee Member Ma Daqing, together with Reverend Peter Mack of the Beihai Chinese Anglican Church, to Hong Kong to convene fellow villagers in Hong Kong, discuss fundraising to expand relief efforts, and report to the Central Relief Committee, hoping to get assistance.

### Concessions in Hankou and Tianjin Still Under Blockade: British Ambassador to Visit Tianjin for Inspection; Some of Those Arrested in Hankou Released

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Hankou report: The Japanese military authorities have again placed a large notice board at the only entrance to the French Concession, which reads: "From 10 PM to 8 AM the next morning, foreigners are prohibited from passing." Furthermore, eight Chinese who were arrested a few days ago on suspicion of being anti-Japanese have now been released, with one still in custody. One of them is the editor of the former Hankou Sweeping News.

[Associated Press, Hankou, 18th] A Japanese spokesperson stated that all gates of the French Concession have been opened. Starting from the 20th, the French Concession will be supplied with tap water for four hours each day. These concessions are entirely due to the recent arrest of Chinese in the French Concession who were handed over to the Japanese. A Japanese intelligence agency has now established an office in the French Concession to issue passes to those who wish to reside outside the French Concession. The Japanese continue to maintain an obstinate attitude towards foreigners. Japanese soldiers search all passing vehicles and search pedestrians at the entrances to all concessions.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Tianjin report: The British and French concessions in Tianjin are currently still under blockade by the enemy, and negotiations between the two sides have made no progress. The British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, will arrive in Tianjin at the end of this month. The British here will prepare to consult with Sir Archibald Clark Kerr on all matters before negotiating with the enemy again.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Tianjin report: Tianjin's defenses are weak, and the local area is extremely unstable. Gunfire was continuous all night above Hebei Guan on the evening of the 16th, and the area remained under martial law until the morning of the 17th. Zhou Sijing, the head of the puppet Tianjin Public Security Bureau, was recently dismissed and imprisoned by the traitor Pan Yugui for unequal distribution of profits from the transportation of opium, etc.

### Extensive Talks Between Johnson and Hull to Discuss the Far East Situation

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The US Ambassador to China, Nelson Johnson, held extensive talks with Secretary of State Cordell Hull today regarding the situation in China. Johnson stated that China is bound to wage a long-term war of resistance and that Japan's indiscriminate bombing will not achieve victory because the morale of the Chinese people is extremely high.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] Nelson Johnson, the United States Ambassador to China, was summoned back to the country and arrived here today. He immediately held talks with Secretary of State Cordell Hull and the Director of the State Department's Far Eastern Division, and then met with President Roosevelt to submit a report on the situation in the Far East.

### Commander of the US Far East Fleet to Inspect the Yangtze River Soon

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Shanghai report: The Shanghai China Weekly Review yesterday published news about the inspection of the Yangtze River by Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the US Far East Fleet, and US Consul General Gauss in Shanghai. The newspaper stated that this news was only known to a few people close to Admiral Yarnell and the US Consul General before it was announced. The two will embark on the USS Isabel and leave Shanghai at 8:30 AM tomorrow, returning to Shanghai on the 23rd. Consul General Gauss also only stated yesterday afternoon that this trip was of a recreational nature. However, people here do not view it that way. Analyzing it from a political perspective, this trip is related to the opening of the Yangtze River and is also to investigate the situation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, such as the disharmony between the American expatriates in Wuhu and the Japanese. Furthermore, according to the China Weekly Review, the US Commander and Consul General will discuss the current conditions of the Yangtze River and the mainland with American business associations along the way.

### Street Fighting Occurs in Jingshan, Central Hubei

[Central News Agency, Guanchang, 19th] In central Hubei, the enemy has been dispersing its forces and fiercely attacking Jingshan for days. Our officers and soldiers are fighting a bloody battle, vowing not to retreat. Both sides have repeatedly fought over control, with street fighting occurring several times. Our defending forces have suffered significant casualties under the enemy's fierce artillery fire. On the 18th, a portion of the enemy troops broke into the city. Our reinforcements have now arrived and begun a counterattack. The enemy has also increased its forces to more than 2,000 men.

### Hiranuma to Announce Japanese Cabinet's Policy Guidelines

[Tokyo, 18th, Foreign Dispatch] Prime Minister Hiranuma is scheduled to announce eight policy guidelines in the Diet on the 21st. The content is as follows: (1) Japan will resolutely achieve the objectives of the current China Incident according to its unwavering policy. (2) Japan proposes establishing a new order in East Asia and will implement it along the lines of "universal principles of heaven and earth." (3) Japan will continue to defeat the anti-Japanese Kuomintang regime, but those Chinese people of vision who are willing to cooperate with Japan to transform China will be invited to participate in the creation of this order. (4) Japan will strive to promote understanding with third countries, while continuing to cooperate with sympathetic and friendly third countries. (5) The ultimate goal of Japan in this Sino-Japanese War is not military victory but the cooperation between Japan, Manchukuo, and China, and the transformation of China. (6) Because there are still many obstacles at present, all national resources should be concentrated to achieve this goal. (7) National defense should be strengthened. (8) The productivity of the business community should be developed, and the mechanism for national mobilization should be strengthened. In addition, Hiranuma also intends to request the Diet to approve the budget and other bills.

[Tokyo, 18th, Foreign Dispatch] Finance Minister Ishiwata is scheduled to address the Diet on the 21st, taking the opportunity to point out that the general account budget for 1939-40 totals 3.6094 billion yen, exceeding the current budget by 100 million yen. The revenue shortfall is 800 million yen, which is 198 million yen less than the current budget. Public bonds will be issued to make up the difference. Ishiwata will also announce an increase in taxes of 150 million to 200 million yen, including additional income tax and commodity tax. As for foreign exchange policy, the exchange rate will remain at one shilling and two pence per yuan.

### After the Explanation of Reasons by the Ministry of Finance, Our Foreign Bonds Rebound: The Suspension of Overdrafting for Debt Repayment is Forced; We are Preparing to Consider Solutions

[Reuters, London, 19th] After a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Finance made a statement on the suspension of overdrafting foreign debts secured by customs duties, the impression received by financial circles here today was good. Therefore, all Chinese bonds rose in unison. Chinese figures generally believe that although it indicates that China will not be able to continue paying these debts in the future, part of the purpose is to call on people around the world to pay attention to the fact that China has always used its own resources to deal with all debts so far. All parties hope that the spokesperson's statement indicates that the Chinese government is now finding a way to seek a satisfactory solution to this problem.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 19th] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance said when receiving reporters yesterday that China is willing to pay all foreign debts and is preparing to consider a fair method to seek a solution, but firstly, the customs duties obtained in the Japanese-occupied areas should be returned to China, and secondly, the action of interfering with Chinese legal currency should be stopped. The spokesperson also confirmed that China has no intention of suspending payment of foreign debts. Although there are no detailed reports on the total revenue of customs duties in the Japanese-occupied areas, according to statistics in 1936, Shanghai accounted for 45.9%, Tianjin 10.9%, Hankou 7.3%, and Guangzhou 3.4%. The declaration issued by the Ministry of Finance on the 15th of this month refers to foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties. Other foreign debts are not included. The total amount of long-term foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties is 2.5 billion yuan. The principal and interest due each month this year is approximately 18 million yuan. The amount due to Britain for the Boxer Indemnity this month is 50,000 pounds, and the amount due to the United States is 160,000 US dollars. The revenue from customs duties in 1938 was 234.57 million yuan, of which about four-fifths was collected from ports controlled by the Japanese. However, the tax revenue of the three northeastern provinces was not included, because all revenue from the three northeastern provinces has been swallowed by the Japanese since the Incident of 1931.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 19th] Last week, the Japanese forced the Shanghai Customs to adopt Japanese for customs declarations. As a result, 70 new Japanese personnel were added to the customs staff. Currently, there are 340 foreigners in the Shanghai Customs, of whom 220 are Japanese.

### Important Discussions Regarding Relations: The Japanese Plundering of Customs Duties; The Japan-Puppet Customs Agreement Cannot Be Recognized; Japan's Infringement of Creditor Rights Must Be Opposed Urgently

[Our Newspaper Special News] The Chongqing Ministry of Finance issued a notice on the 15th, reiterating the government's determination to maintain creditworthiness, sternly condemning the illegal acts of the enemy in infringing upon the creditor rights of friendly countries, and declaring the legitimate measure of temporarily suspending the payment of debt from various customs offices in the war zone. The righteousness of the language attracted attention at home and abroad. Public opinion in various countries unanimously attacked the enemy, and there were no idle words against us. Only a few people advocated recognizing the Customs Revenue Deposit Agreement of May 2 last year in order to obtain various indemnities that should be repaid by customs offices in the war zone. The reporter inquired about the enemy's plunder of customs duties from a source with special relations, as follows:

Customs revenue is divided into gold units and national currency. Each month, the customs commissioners of each customs office remit money to the account of the Chief Inspector of Customs at the Central Bank, and then the Chief Inspector of Customs entrusts the HSBC Bank to remit the foreign debt to be repaid when it is due. The enemy's forcible seizure of customs duties began in 1932 when the customs offices in the Northeast were taken over by the enemy's puppet military force, accounting for about 20% of the national tax revenue. Under the efforts of our government to maintain domestic and foreign credit, it was not affected. At that time, although the enemy clamored that it must have the approval of the countries concerned to recognize the puppet Manchukuo and the guarantee part of the foreign debt indemnity before it could be allocated, all countries ignored it. Later, although Germany and Italy helped the evildoers and recognized the puppet regime, they did not get any leftovers. The enemy's covering its ears to steal the bell and deceiving its back, betraying its credit, has long been seen by China and foreign countries. Since the war of resistance, Tianjin Customs has been the first to bear the brunt. Since September of the previous year, the tax revenue has been in the hands of Yokohama Specie Bank. Later, the customs offices of Qinhuangdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, Longkou, and Qingdao were successively extracted by the enemy. Among them, the quota of Tianjin Customs to allocate various debts and indemnities (this quota often remains unchanged over the years, approximately equal to the percentage of each customs office's tax revenue in the total national amount, but not entirely the same) is the largest, accounting for 23%. After September 1937, Tianjin Customs only remitted 200,000 yuan in national currency, and the other North China customs offices did not remit a penny. The ratio of Shanghai Customs to allocate various debts and indemnities is 43%. Since November of the previous year, it has been constantly threatened by the enemy's looting. On May 3 last year, the British and Japanese agreement on the deposit of customs duties in North China and Shanghai was announced, and the tax revenue was transferred to the Yokohama Specie Bank, still in the name of the customs commissioner, designated to be allocated to the foreign debt and indemnity guarantee fund. At that time, our government's spokesperson resolutely opposed the agreement as damaging our sovereignty. The Chinese staff of the Jianghai Customs went on strike out of righteous indignation to resist and formed a customs protection organization to support the government. The enemy's intention was still not satisfied. It requested the British and Japanese agreement to take effect from the outbreak of the war in the previous year, that is, the 25 million yuan accumulated by the Jianghai Customs in HSBC should be preserved by the Yokohama Specie Bank. Our government strictly ordered the Chief Inspector of Customs to resolutely refuse. The enemy's plan did not succeed, and the customs offices of Xiamen, Hankou, and Guangzhou were successively seized. The tax revenue of the customs offices in various war zones occupied by the enemy accounts for about 84% of the country. Our government only obtained a very small portion of the tax revenue from the war zone last year, that is, the Jianghai Customs once remitted more than 1.8 million yuan out of its total tax revenue of more than 80 million yuan in June, and still painstakingly maintained domestic and foreign credit, accounting for the amount that the war zone customs offices should have remitted but did not remit, amounting to 175 million yuan. The so-called British and Japanese agreement, because the government did not recognize it, the enemy also tried its best to sabotage it, regarding it as a smokescreen for openly seizing tax revenue. If the government is to change its firm opposition stance since May last year, it is to erase the lessons of the Northeast customs offices in the past; to become a realist echo; and to be laughed at by the enemy.

According to the enemy's recent attempts, North China is to be turned into the Northeast, and Central China is to be turned into North China. The same is true of its customs. It is not only not restricted by the British and Japanese agreement but may also come up with another shameless trick, claiming that customs revenue belongs to the puppet organizations it raises and that all countries must recognize the traitorous regime before debts can be paid. When that time comes, how will a new solution be obtained? In short, the purpose of the government's notice on the 15th is to point out the fact that the enemy has harmed the interests of friendly countries' creditors and its responsibility. If the responsibility is placed on the government's refusal to recognize the British and Japanese agreement, it is inherently an effect that is a cause.

The most appropriate action in this matter is for the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to jointly protest to Japan, condemning its illegal act of infringing upon the creditor rights of friendly countries, urging it to respect the interests of third countries in China, and using effective economic sanctions as a backing for the protest, assisting China and maintaining the independence and integrity of its customs sovereignty, so that it can talk about equal benefit. In the past, there was a proposal to have Shanghai's tax revenue kept by an international banking consortium or a third-country bank. Recently, the rumor that tax revenue is not deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank has been rife. Friendly countries must not sit idly by and watch the continuation of the enemy's policy of encompassing everything and be deceived by it.

Finally, if China were to recognize the British and Japanese agreement, it would be tantamount to legally recognizing the enemy's act of plundering tax revenue. Since the September 18th Incident, the Chinese government and friendly countries have insisted on not recognizing all kinds of aggressive facts that undermine Chinese sovereignty. There is no room for negotiation on this point, and it should be sympathized and understood by all friendly countries!

### Northwest Situation and River Defense

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Bai Yun

(Continued from Part Two)

V. The Importance of the Northwest

In the past, our defense of Shanghai, Xuzhou, Wuhan, and other places was strategically aimed at buying time. We anticipated that, if necessary, we would have to voluntarily abandon them. However, under the current circumstances, we cannot harbor such notions about defending the Northwest or Southwest. We should utilize all the experiences gained from the sixteen months of the war of resistance to defend the last stronghold upon which the nation's people and their lives depend, and the base for recovering lost territories—the Northwest and Southwest—to prevent any further losses. If we believe that in the future some areas in the Northwest may need to be voluntarily abandoned for strategic reasons, then we must make the greatest effort to buy as much time as possible. Therefore, the task of defending the Northwest will be more arduous than defending any important place in the past. In our minds, it is best not to entertain the idea that the Northwest might still fall.

The Northwest is not only related to our national defense lines but also serves as a shield for the Southwestern defense base, a base for recovering lost territories in North China, and the rear for Shanxi, a fortress defending North China. It absolutely cannot be allowed to waver in the slightest.

In terms of transportation, economy, politics, culture, and military affairs, Guanzhong, especially Xi'an, is the center of the entire Northwest, and it can even be said to be the heart of the Northwest. Therefore, to defend the Northwest, we must first value Guanzhong, especially Xi'an. The Han and Hui ethnic groups in the Northwest must sincerely and without division jointly shoulder the responsibility of defending the Northwest, especially Guanzhong and Xi'an.

Some people believe that Shaanxi is the "vanguard" of the Northwest, but this statement is problematic. If that were the case, our front line for defending the Northwest would be predetermined in Shaanxi. This would mean that not only could Shaanxi not be defended, but the Northwest could not be defended either. The periphery of the Northwest includes western Henan, southern Suiyuan, Shanxi, western Henan, and northwestern Hubei. To defend the Northwest, we must consolidate Shaanxi, especially Guanzhong. To consolidate Shaanxi, especially Guanzhong, we must use all our strength in military and political affairs to consolidate this outer line. We must carry out continuous offensive defense on this outer line. This is the fundamental condition for defending the Northwest. To protect the Yellow River line, we should cross the river to fight, not just cross the river to defend.

On this outer line, we have long been prepared. Recently, we have made further deployments. This is precisely a brilliant strategy for protecting the Northwest. Especially in Shanxi, we not only do not allow the troops to retreat across the Yellow River or to Henan, but we also constantly increase our forces. Just in Shanxi alone, our forces are no less than several hundred thousand. The development of guerrilla warfare is extremely widespread. Extremely solid guerrilla warfare bases have been established in northwestern Shanxi, northeastern Shanxi, southeastern Shanxi, and the Zhongtiao Mountains area of southern Shanxi. Our troops in the Lüliang Mountains in western Shanxi and the Fen River basin also have some bases. The enemy only maintains some strongholds along the Tongpu Railway and the Zhengtai Railway and is constantly subjected to our attacks, unable to rest and constantly on the run. This is the most important reason why the enemy has not dared to cross the river to invade Shaanxi or Henan for more than a year.

The enemy has been regularly contained by us in Shanxi with five or six divisions of troops, and they are still standing unsteadily. How can they talk about crossing the river? In the past and at present, they fundamentally do not have such an attempt. In the past and at present, the enemy only has these two attempts in Shanxi: First, to attack the various banks along the Yellow River, wanting to block the various crossings, cut off our connections between the east and west banks of the river, and prevent us from reinforcing troops and transporting ammunition to Shanxi, etc., in order to trap our troops in eastern Shanxi in a difficult situation and facilitate their annihilation. This attempt has never been successfully realized: Although Fenglingdu, Daqingguan, Wuwangdu, Dongyumenkou, and other crossings were blocked due to the loss of Yongji, Hejin, Linjin, and Ronghe counties, the enemy has repeatedly been attacked by us at Yuqu, Pinglu in southern Shanxi, and the crossings in western Shanxi. The purpose of blocking the crossings has not been achieved to this day. Our communication between the front and rear has never been cut off. Recently, the purpose of the enemy's attack on Jixian and Liulin was also nothing more than this, and they did not have the intention of crossing the river to invade northern Shaanxi. When the general public hears the sound of artillery fire on the Yellow River bank or sees the enemy attacking a certain crossing on the Yellow River line, they think that the enemy is going to cross the river. This is really naively ridiculous. Second, in order to prevent the development of our guerrilla forces and to protect the traffic lines of their railways or important highways, the enemy constantly wants to launch zonal attacks on our guerrilla bases, such as the past attacks on Wutai, Changzhi, Zhongtiao Mountains, and the Fen River basin. None of these are outside of this attempt, but the results have mostly been failures, and they have suffered great blows. Under such circumstances, does the enemy still dare to lightly talk about crossing the river? Moreover, in the midst of the current overall stalemate of the war, the enemy has not increased its troops in Shanxi, and some have even been transferred to the Northeast. It's just that those few troops are being transferred east and west to put on a show of being prepared, or they are only protecting their strongholds in certain places with offense as defense. How dare they risk crossing the river? The Northwest is relatively cold, which is also what the enemy fears. Therefore, even if they let small groups of them cross the river now, they would not dare.

In the past, because the enemy killed, set fire to, robbed, and [text missing], it stirred up the anti-enemy sentiment of our people. In addition, our troops have become accustomed to guerrilla warfare over time, and cooperation between the military and civilians has become increasingly close. The enemy has suffered quite a bit in military terms. Therefore, in recent months, the enemy has also been doing a great deal of what they call mass movement, using small favors such as loans and stopping burning and killing to lure our ignorant people in order to reduce the resentment of our people and undermine our cooperation between the military and civilians. Originally, the enemy's brutal behavior is extremely difficult to eliminate. The small favors they offer are not easy to gain the trust of our people. But our local self-defense forces have complex components, poor discipline, and their harassment of the people is worse than the enemy's, and the burden on the people is too heavy. The so-called "reasonable burden" is actually extremely unreasonable, causing ignorant and foolish people to inevitably be tempted by the enemy, which is truly regrettable. This situation urgently needs to be improved to increase the anti-war strength of the Northwest outer line.

VI. The Current Situation of the Yellow River Defense Line

Carrying out offensive defense on the Northwest outer line and developing extensive guerrilla warfare are positive methods for defending the Northwest. Strengthening the Yellow River defense and preparing to inflict a head-on blow on the enemy crossing the river are passive methods for defending the Northwest. In military terms alone, to complete the task of defending the Northwest, these two methods must be combined. Only in this way can we implement tail attacks and head-on attacks on the enemy crossing the river, preventing them from crossing the river smoothly.

Although the Yellow River is not an absolute natural barrier, it has its own value in defensive strategy. If there were no Yellow River as a boundary, can we imagine that Shaanxi could still be as stable as it is today after Shanxi was lost? Some people say: The Yellow River can withstand hundreds of thousands of soldiers, which is certainly not an exaggeration.

From Hekouzhen in Shanxi downstream, the Yellow River has a rapid current, and there is too much quicksand. The riverbed changes several times a day, and sandbars rise from the water from time to time. It is extremely difficult for the enemy to sneak across. If the enemy wants to cross the river, its heavy weapons absolutely cannot cross at the beginning. It must occupy considerable strongholds after the infantry crosses the river and defeat our river defense forces before heavy weapons can cross. When both sides use infantry as the main force, the enemy will not be able to defeat us. When the enemy infantry crosses the river, it will immediately engage in hand-to-hand combat with our river defense forces. The enemy's artillery on the other side and the planes in the sky will also lose their effectiveness. In this way, the enemy infantry loses its protection, and its spirit of sacrifice is definitely not as good as ours. We can easily annihilate the enemy in the middle of the stream or after they first land. What should be paid attention to is that our river defense forces should choose key points and make "deep deployment." The most taboo thing is to deploy along the river in a snake-like fashion. Once the enemy breaks through a point, it will be too late to remedy it. (To be continued)

### League of Nations Council Holds Secret Meeting to Discuss China's Appeal; Stimson and Others Organize Committee to Counter Japan with Economic Power

[United Press, Geneva, 19th] The League of Nations Administrative Council abruptly convened a secret meeting at 4 PM today. It is reported that the member states will discuss China's appeal.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 19th] The Sino-Japanese dispute raised by China's chief representative, Ambassador to France Dr. Wellington Koo, at the Administrative Council on the 17th was discussed at a closed-door meeting yesterday by the Quadripartite Committee (Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and China). However, no concrete decision has been made and consultations will continue today. The requests made by Ambassador Koo are unlikely to result in any practical solutions at present. The proposal made by Ambassador Koo to organize an adjustment committee is also unlikely to be adopted by the Administrative Council.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] Due to the departure of the French Ambassador to Japan, the French note to Japan was delivered to the Japanese Foreign Ministry today by the embassy counselor. The contents of the note are similar to those recently sent by Britain and the United States, disapproving of unilateral amendments to the Nine-Power Treaty.

[Reuters, New York, 19th] Americans of social standing have recently organized a committee led by former Secretary of State Stimson, with former U.S. Consul General to Hankou Green as chairman. The purpose of the committee is to prevent the import of scrap iron, oil, iron ore, and freight cars to Japan. The committee will request legal organization at the upcoming session of Congress, and claims to counter countries that violate peace treaties with economic power, as the United States is also a signatory to the treaty.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] Regarding the need to respect the Nine-Power Treaty, after the U.S. government sent two notes to the Japanese government on December 31 of last year, news has recently been issued from Tokyo stating that the Japanese government will declare in its reply that its basic policy is based on the following three principles: (1) racial equality, (2) all existing economic groups, such as the British Empire group and the Pan-American group, must be abolished to realize free trade, and (3) fair distribution of resources so that all countries can freely obtain them. If Britain and the United States can accept these principles, Japan may hold meetings with those countries. Secretary of State Hull did not express his views when he met with reporters today. U.S. political figures said that the U.S. has never seriously considered holding an international conference on the Far East issue. The U.S. government stated in the two notes that it is prepared to seriously consider all proposals based on justice and rationality, meaning that all international issues should be resolved by all the countries involved through domestic negotiations based on rights and obligations. The proposals to be put forward this time may not be satisfactory, even with the fair distribution of resources. This is Japan's slogan, intending to prove that the country should enjoy priority in Chinese commerce.

### U.S. Congress Begins Reviewing Defense Needs; Naval Construction Proposal Immediately Submitted; Japan Angered and Alarmed

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] Congress has begun reviewing America's defense needs. The subcommittees of the Senate and House of Representatives have held consultations with military experts regarding President Roosevelt's $552 million national defense plan. Representative May, chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, may invite Secretary of War Woodring and other senior War Department officials to attend the committee's secret meeting for consultation. According to Representative May, the Military Affairs Committee intends to submit a bill as soon as it has heard the recommendations of the government authorities. The Senate Military Affairs Committee has also held meetings, with representatives from the War Department explaining President Roosevelt's plans to strengthen the air force and the defense of the Panama Canal. According to Representative May's prediction, Congress can quickly process the government's proposed emergency budget for increased aircraft. Detailed information on this case has been submitted by the War Department, and the amount of the government's budget can be decided soon. In addition, the group in the Senate that opposes President Roosevelt's defense budget has become increasingly prominent. The leader, Senator Connally from North Carolina, claimed that we advocate a strict isolation policy. Foreign people are now trying to undermine the American government, and American security is under threat. There are "termites" (referring to the activities of national socialists in the United States) stirring in the United States, but the government is only allocating huge sums of money to resist foreign aggression. What good is that? Representative Young from Minnesota gave a broadcast speech yesterday, criticizing that the purpose of the President's defense message is to put the entire country in a state of hysteria.

[Reuters, Washington, 19th] The Navy's proposal to build more bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans has been approved by President Roosevelt and has been submitted to Congress. The contents of the proposal are unknown, but it is believed that the construction of a very large naval base in Guam can be carried out quickly. According to reports, Japan is seriously concerned about the arming of Guam. A Japanese naval spokesman believes that it is an extremely unfriendly act because Guam is close to Japan's mandated islands.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 19th] Regarding the issue of arming Guam, a Japanese naval spokesman said that arming that place is an unfriendly attitude towards Japan, similar to placing a gun at the door of a neighbor. He does not understand the meaning of the U.S. Navy's expansion. From the perspective of experts, submarine and air force bases are established in inland and remote areas only for the purpose of launching long-range attacks on Japan.

Defense Items Probably Difficult to Obtain

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] The Navy's case regarding defense will be submitted to Congress this week. Representative Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, said that, according to his speculation, this plan will include Guam. It is reported that this plan will be directly submitted to Congress and need not be sent to President Roosevelt for review beforehand. A Navy spokesman said that the Navy will continue to push for the defense event to proceed. Admiral Leahy will attend the committees of the议会 to provide the Navy's opinions and urge the议会 to consider military and other reasons, and further explain the amount of expenses. Because the Navy's defense case requires (1) the议会 to pass the budget, (2) there is a designated special fund in finance, some议员 believe that they will request Congress to pass the defense plan, but it is unlikely to obtain special funds for this purpose. At most, only a small amount of funds will be obtained for the renovation of straits and aircraft. The State Department has not yet expressed its position, but it is generally predicted that it opposes the defense of Guam. The议员 said that during the議会 debate, they will ask Hull to explain his attitude. Senator Connally, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from Texas, said that he opposes the defense of Guam or other places outside of Hawaii. He said, "We don't have to try to defend the Philippines. The Filipinos want freedom, let them have it. We should stay out of it and not be involved." Senator Borah said that if the Guam defense case is included on the 议会 agenda, he will lead议员 in opposition. Major General Rivers also expressed opposition to the defense of Guam.

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Major General Rivers joined Senator Borah in opposing the construction of a new naval base in Guam. Rivers, who had been stationed in the Philippines for many years, said that Guam is about 4,000 miles away from Hawaii, which is extremely strong in U.S. defense, and its military value in defense is only in its ability to serve as an outstanding part. Under this situation, Guam is too far away, and this outstanding part cannot be defended.

Representatives Request Expansion of the Air Force

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] Major General Arnold, commander of the U.S. Army Air Corps, claimed at a closed-door meeting of the House Military Affairs Committee on the 18th that, according to his prediction, the United States can produce an average of 12,000 military aircraft annually in the next three years. Arnold had previously announced at an open meeting that, according to the investigation of military authorities, the current production capacity of American aircraft factories can produce approximately 2,500 aircraft per year, and it can be increased by two or four times in the future. Representative May, chairman of the committee, today submitted a proposal advocating authorizing an increase of 3,680 Army aircraft, so that the number of aircraft in the U.S. Army Air Corps does not exceed 6,000. It is reported that Major General Arnold will announce that the United States should build four air force bases in two years to complete its national defense. One of the bases is in Puerto Rico, one is in Alaska, and two are in the United States mainland. At the same time, the air force base in Hawaii should also be expanded. Arnold also discussed the importance of establishing a large-scale aircraft production capacity in the United States, specifically recommending that the House of Representatives allow aircraft manufacturers to stop manufacturing private aircraft and start manufacturing at least 3,000 military aircraft as quickly as possible to serve as airfields required in President Roosevelt's defense plan.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] Representative McKeough has recently submitted a bill to the House of Representatives authorizing the Army Air Corps to expand to 6,000 people (originally 2,320 people). In accordance with President Roosevelt's proposal, courses in flight learning will be established in various universities. Representative Arnold said in a speech to the House Military Affairs Committee that he first warned Congress that if we are to realize President Roosevelt's huge defense plan to counter the imagined enemy, we must greatly increase the manufacturing volume of aircraft. Representative Shinter, a populist party Representative from Pennsylvania, yesterday delivered a speech in the House of Representatives, suggesting that 16,000 miles of highways be built across the United States, divided into nine main lines. Three lines run from the eastern border of the United States to the western border, and another six lines run from south to north. Each highway is 100 feet wide, and eight cars can pass at the same time. The cost is 800 million yuan. Some of the artillery used by the troops, such as 16-inch artillery, and searchlights, etc., should be equipped with rubber tires, and most of them should be concentrated in the central regions, so that once something happens, they can be driven to the borders within 12 hours, and transported to the borders with rubber tires within 22 hours to improve the effectiveness of national defense.

### Italian Mechanized Troops Open British Border

[Central News Agency, 济济的 19th] According to a dispatch from Hala (in eastern Abyssinia, not far from British and French Somaliland), there is an Italian mechanized unit advancing toward the border of British Somaliland.

### Britain and France Continue Non-Intervention Policy on Spanish Civil War; Spanish Embassy Points Out Italy Violates Agreement; Belgium Establishes Diplomatic Relations with Rebels

[Central News Agency, London, 19th] The Cabinet held a meeting yesterday, with Prime Minister Chamberlain reporting on the results of his visit to Italy. It is reported that the contents of the report are roughly the same as the statements made by Britain before Chamberlain's visit to Italy. Cabinet members seemed generally satisfied with the overall impact of this trip. Government officials believe that the Anglo-Italian Agreement can be fully implemented. Regarding the Spanish question, it is hopeless to seek the withdrawal of Italian volunteers from the Nationalist forces before they achieve final victory. At the same time, there seems to be deep concern here about any further interference in Spanish affairs.

[Reuters, London, 18th] The Executive Committee of the British Labour Party has passed a resolution asking the British government and people to pay attention to the continued violation of the non-intervention agreement by the German and Italian governments to aid Franco, and requesting the immediate reopening of the closed French-Spanish border and the lifting of the ban on supplying arms to Spain.

[Central News Agency, London, 19th] Prime Minister Chamberlain recently agreed to the request of Labour Party leader Attlee to write to Attlee explaining the government's attitude toward the Spanish issue. Chamberlain wrote in his letter that the government believes that if the ban on the export of arms to Spain is lifted to supply arms to the Spanish government, the result will inevitably be an expansion of the war, and the impact will be unimaginable. Therefore, the government has no intention of taking this action. Regarding the risk of famine among the people in the areas under the control of the Republican government, the government recently consulted with the governments of the United States and other countries to implement large-scale relief. As a result of the consultation, under the current circumstances, this plan seems unlikely to be realized. In addition, the government has consulted with the governments of various countries to provide relief to Spanish refugees by existing non-governmental organizations. The government intends to continue to handle this matter in this manner. The government is closely monitoring the situation in Spain. If the situation changes and the date of the opening of Congress needs to be changed, the government will naturally suggest reopening Congress on a different date.

Pumla Declaration Guarantees Territory

[Associated Press, Paris, 18th] According to sources close to the government, the French cabinet has decided to reject the demands of the left-wing to have France assist the Spanish government forces. The cabinet meeting unanimously endorsed Foreign Minister Pumla's foreign policy, and a declaration will be submitted to the议会 next Thursday, reaffirming the non-intervention policy, guaranteeing the integrity of French territory, and rejecting territorial concessions. However, it also stated that it is willing to negotiate on the Gibraltar railway and port to reach a viable plan. According to reliable sources, the cabinet is prepared to maintain its non-intervention policy at the expense of the cabinet's downfall when a vote of confidence is held on Friday, and to wage war with the left-wing groups led by Bloom.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 19th] The cabinet held a meeting yesterday, and the focus of the consultation was only one item: Foreign Minister Pumla's draft speech on the international situation. It took two and a half hours to complete. It is reported that as a result of the cabinet meeting, all members unanimously agreed to the points in the speech. Pumla is scheduled to deliver a speech in the House of Representatives today.

Spanish Rebels Threaten Barcelona

[Reuters, London, 18th] The Spanish Ambassador to Britain sent a note to the British Foreign Office, requesting that the note be forwarded to the Non-Intervention Committee, stating that the rebel government purchased four destroyers and two submarines from Italy in 1937. This sale was a blatant violation of the non-intervention agreement by the Italian government.

[Reuters, London, 18th] According to a Spanish news agency, the Spanish government forces have made great progress in attacking the Estremadura front. Government forces have recovered several new positions and threaten the rear of the rebel positions in 密加拉 and 提瓊那拉.

[Central News Agency, Lerida, 19th] The rebels are now increasingly approaching Barcelona. The triangle area occupied by the rebels daily totals 76 square miles. Jutra and Igualada will fall soon. As a result, when the rebels attack Barcelona, there will be no obstacles along the way. Military officials say that the国民军 has broken through the line from 措麻里 to Igualada in many places, so the attack on Barcelona may be difficult to stop.

[Central News Agency, Beijing, 18th] Belgium and the Spanish rebels signed an agreement at the Foreign Ministry here today. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak was attending the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting in Geneva, so Foreign Ministry Secretary Van Langenhass represented the chairman. The rebel side was represented by Zulus, General Franco's representative to Belgium. Therefore, Belgium and the Spanish rebels have officially established diplomatic relations.

### League of Nations High Commissioner for Danzig, Burckhardt's Future Sparks Controversy in Geneva

[Reuters, Geneva, 18th] Today in Geneva, the question of whether Mr. Burckhardt, the League of Nations High Commissioner for Danzig, should resign has caused a stir. During a private meeting of the "Danzig Three-Nation Committee," Britain and France advocated for Mr. Burckhardt to remain in his post, while Sweden supported his resignation. The president of the World Jewish Congress, Mr. Goldmann, also strongly urged Mr. Burckhardt to resign, stating that the constitution of Danzig was clearly being violated and that if Mr. Burckhardt continued to serve, the League of Nations would be seen as condoning his past actions. Mr. Goldmann also claimed, "Mr. Burckhardt's orders to expel Jews from Danzig are even more severe than those of the German National Socialists." Furthermore, Poland also strenuously argued that Mr. Burckhardt should not resign.

### German Pastor to be Tried for Praying for Peace

[Reuters, Berlin, 18th] Pastor Mülling, a leader of the German opposition clergy, and two other pastors have been charged with "misusing their pastoral office" and will face trial in court. It is alleged that in September of last year, when Germany threatened Czechoslovakia, Mr. Mülling asked his parishioners to pray for peace and the success of international peace efforts, and he was charged as a result. His salary has also been suspended, it is said.

### Suspects in British Bombing Case on Trial

[Reuters, London, 17th] Suspects arrested in London and its surroundings in connection with recent bombing cases were tried in "Bow Street" today. Several aspects of the trial proceedings were noteworthy. Before the commencement of questioning, the charges against each individual were not announced. First, three of the seven individuals were separately questioned one at a time. After the questioning was completed and they had left the courtroom, another individual was summoned. Secondly, the three individuals were then ordered to appear together for trial. Several rifles and munitions were presented as evidence in court, and it was proven that they had been found in the residences of some of the defendants. The charges against each defendant were announced later, namely, illegally possessing firearms and explosives. Furthermore, three of the defendants were also accused of possessing several declarations of the "Irish Republican Army," it is said.

### Rajchman to Leave the League of Nations

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 19th Special Dispatch] According to inquiries by this reporter from the League of Nations Secretariat, Dr. Rajchman, the founder and director of the League of Nations Health Organisation, and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol are to be dismissed under the guise of budget cuts and elimination of redundant staff. Dr. Rajchman has presided over the League of Nations Health Organisation for seventeen years, and he was the initiator of the League's technical health cooperation with China and its representative in China. Consequently, the Japanese have repeatedly attacked him, denouncing him as a pro-China element. In recent years, Fascists have denounced Dr. Rajchman for advocating a collective security system and democratic politics. Although the dismissal order for Dr. Rajchman has not yet been formally announced, it is understood that he generally plans to leave the League of Nations Secretariat in early February.

### U.S. Department of Commerce Considering Convening Meeting of Cotton-Producing Countries

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] According to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, the department is considering convening a meeting of cotton-producing countries to discuss the disposal of surplus cotton products. The White House also held a meeting yesterday to discuss this matter, recognizing that the problem is very serious, but no decision was made.

Brief Commentary

### Japanese Espionage Activities

Espionage warfare is one of the most important forms of modern warfare, especially for Fascist aggressors. Due to their inherent political and economic weaknesses, they must employ all kinds of skillful methods to compensate for their inability to defeat the enemy in war. Therefore, these countries are said to spare no expense and be meticulous in their use of spies. The extensiveness and intensity of Japanese espionage and activities are particularly astonishing to the world. Since the establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact, they have secretly colluded with Germany, Italy, and other countries, making their activities even more noteworthy.

A Singapore dispatch on the 19th stated, "Japanese espionage has been particularly active here recently. On the 18th, British government detectives conducted a large-scale search of Japanese shops and residences, seizing countless secret military documents." This is just one example picked at random. These spies are not only found in Singapore but are also spread throughout the Philippines and even around everyone. This is an open secret. In addition to hoping that the authorities of friendly nations such as Britain, the United States, and France can take further precautions against this, for the sake of local security and international peace, people from all walks of life should also be vigilant, especially those working to save the nation and officials with national responsibilities. In places with unusually complex social relationships, they should constantly examine their own behavior, at least passively preventing themselves from being used by spies.

### The Problem of Civilian Entertainment

After art becomes a commodity, it becomes estranged from the majority of toiling people. According to newspaper reports, street theater has been very active in Hong Kong recently. Civilian dramas are often performed in places like Spring Garden Lane in Wan Chai and Guangdong Road in Tai Kok Tsui, attracting general poor men and women. This is a problem worth paying attention to. Those enthusiastic about national salvation and the theatrical movement should quickly launch a campaign to promote proper civilian entertainment and the popularization of theater. Although street dramas and "living newspapers," which have had great success in the North and war zones, may not be entirely suitable for the environment and needs of the working people in Hong Kong, it is indeed urgent to improve the existing civilian entertainment, which contains toxins, and everyone should not let it go lightly.

### The Political Situation in Romania

— Long Beard

(I) Why is International Attention Focused on Romania?

Romania is a kingdom in the Balkan Peninsula with an area of only 295,000 square kilometers and a total population of less than 20 million. Its culture is relatively backward, and its domestic industry is not very developed. However, it has now become an important object of study for European international issues. The reasons can be explained in several aspects: First, in terms of resources, its natural reserves and agricultural products are very abundant. The main products are oil, food, timber, and livestock. Oil is the main military resource of modern warfare, and timber and livestock are important raw materials for industrial countries. Therefore, imperialists who are militaristic and lack raw materials regard it as an object of plunder and are unwilling to let go. Second, in terms of location, (1) it borders the Ukrainian Soviet Republic of the Soviet Union, forming a conduit for the Fascist bloc to spy on Ukraine; (2) the Danube River flows into the Black Sea through Romania, and the Fascist bloc wants to go straight down the Danube and extend to the Near East; (3) it occupies the coastline of the western Black Sea. Germany is competing with Britain for naval supremacy, and its fleet must be able to enter and exit the Black Sea. Third, Romania's fate cannot be separated from world peace. If Romania falls into the hands of Germany, Hitler will be even more powerful, and Goebbels' strategic plan will have a solution. The intricate contradictions and conflicts between countries have woven Romania into a focal point. If this powder keg explodes, it will affect the whole of Europe and spread the war to the whole world. Currently, in our China and in Spain in Europe, wars of aggression and resistance are raging. The proportion of the world's population and area occupied by people who have been swept into the vortex and areas that have become battlefields proves that the war is not local, and the Second World War has already begun.

Japan began its aggression with the "September 18th" Incident, occupying our Northeast four provinces in one fell swoop. The international community did not respond. Then Italy sent troops to annex Abyssinia, and the international community still did not respond. Germany and Italy then united to attack Spain, and Japan further sought to monopolize China in the East. Germany annexed Austria and partitioned Czechoslovakia in Europe. The three Fascist demons echoed each other, looting one after another. If the European Fascists were to acquire Romania and enter the Near East through this gateway, they would join forces with Japan, and the world would become even more unmanageable. Therefore, Romania's survival is an important matter related to world security. Now, the general political situation of Romania is briefly described as follows;

(II) From the Goga Cabinet to the Royal Dictatorship

Goga was the leader of the pro-German faction. Before taking office, he lived in Berlin for a long time and had close relations with Hitler, Hess, Göring, Goebbels, Neurath, Ribbentrop, Rosenberg, and other Nazi figures. Their purpose was to get Goga to return, convey Germany's intentions, and persuade Carol to join the Nazi Party. As a result, under Hitler's design, the German secret service created a false report saying that Titulescu (a Romanian politician who had served as foreign minister) had engaged in various activities abroad that were detrimental to the Romanian king, and handed it to Goga to take back to Bucharest to report the secret. At that time, Titulescu was ill in the country, so he was sent to his death under the consultation of eight doctors at Saint Mary's. According to another rumor in Bucharest, he was poisoned by a Iron Guard thug who disguised himself as a chef and sneaked into the hotel. This false report was truly a double-edged sword, not only removing Hitler's eyesore, but also paving the way for Goga to take office. On December 28th of last year, the Romanian king ordered the dissolution of the Tătărescu cabinet. Rewarding merit, Goga was ordered to form a cabinet. The new foreign minister, Milescu, was the chairman of the Romanian-Italian Law Society. From then on, Romania became estranged from the Soviet Union and embarked on a German-Italian route. First, it recognized Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and signed the so-called Treaty of Friendship between the two countries.

The Goga cabinet had no mass base. Even among the bourgeoisie, not many people supported Goga. After Goga came to power, Romanian securities on the Bucharest Stock Exchange fell one after another, and bankers faced bank runs.

Goga's first move in domestic affairs was to exclude Jews, with the aim of extracting money while at the same time wooing a group of Romanians who intended to enrich themselves by expelling Jews.

The second move was to illegally dissolve the parliament and hold new elections. To facilitate election fraud, all local autonomous organizations and people's groups established during the previous cabinet era were reorganized and replaced with Fascist elements.

After Goga came to power, the first difficulty he encountered was that countries such as Britain, France, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union could not immediately change their foreign policies. Romania's rearmament depended on military equipment and economic support from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Britain, and France, so it had to declare that its foreign policy would remain unchanged and deal with the situation.

The Goga cabinet had a short lifespan. After its establishment, the domestic political situation was unstable, and there was no way to deal with finance and the economy. Within six weeks, it showed complete failure. Especially because Britain notified Carol that he should not visit Britain until the political situation stabilized, and France expressed the same. Carol borrowed money without success, feeling that he should be cautious. So the cabinet was suddenly reorganized again. He wanted to be a dictator himself and did not want to be constrained by political parties. Therefore, all the new cabinet members were selected by himself. The prime minister was Cristea (who served in the Regency Council during Carol's exile and was a sympathizer of the Fascists), while Tătărescu was the soul of the new cabinet. (Tătărescu rose to prominence because of his success in suppressing the peasant riots in the southern region of Basarabia and had long been trusted by the king.)

The characteristics of this cabinet were monarchical military dictatorship. Carol honestly suspended the implementation of the original constitution. On February 21st, he promulgated a constitution granted by the emperor, prohibiting political party activities, and concentrating all power in the hands of the army. The ethnic policy was still consistent in excluding foreign races, and the diplomatic route was to approach Germany and Italy, leaving aside the Soviet Union, France, Czechoslovakia, and the Balkan countries. From then on, the formal constitutional system became a complete monarchical dictatorship.

But Carol was still not satisfied with this cabinet. On March 31st, the entire cabinet resigned again. On April 1st, it was reorganized again, replacing it with a group of purely obedient puppets. The foreign minister was changed to Comnen. When serving as ambassador to Germany, Comnen advocated distancing himself from France and becoming closer to Germany. Carol wanted to use Hitler's power to annex Hungary and lend all the kerosene, which was the collateral for French loans, to Germany as an exchange condition. Comnen's appointment as foreign minister contained this function.

The tragic demise of Austria and the conspiracy of the Iron Guard in March of this year awakened Carol's dream. He began to realize that Hitler's aim was to plunder and could not give him any assistance. In May, when Hitler threatened Czechoslovakia with troops on the border, he truly realized the danger of shared misfortune. So, on the one hand, Prime Minister Cristea went to Warsaw to sign an agreement with Poland, and on the other hand, he continued to suppress domestic dissenting forces, consolidate his dictatorship, and seek help from Britain. Relations between Britain and Romania then had new developments. Below are some of the most noteworthy things:

(1) Britain instructed Romania to build a naval base on the coast of the Black Sea at the port of Constanța, with an area 62 times larger than the original size of the port, which could accommodate the largest modern warships. (2) Important figures from British political and economic circles went to Romania to investigate one after another. (3) Britain increased its purchases of Romanian agricultural products and oil and made huge investments. (4) Special laws were formulated to facilitate British investment in Romania. (5) Britain invested in the development of Romania's arms manufacturing industry. (6) The method of account settlement was revised. (7) British banking circles bought large amounts of Romanian stocks.

Recently (December 20th), the German Havas news agency reported that Romanian Foreign Minister Comnen had proposed to King Carol that he resign. The news of the resignation of this pro-German foreign minister is worth noting.

(III) General Political Situation

1. The Iron Guard

The Iron Guard, also known as the "Fatherland Party," is a secret terrorist group that emerged after the war. The initial leader was Codreanu. He became famous for killing the police chief who banned student anti-Jewish demonstrations in Jassy in 1923. Although he claimed to be a Romanian nationalist, he was not of Romanian blood but a Ukrainian. His real name is Zelinski. The purpose of this group is Fascism. Oppose the Soviet Union, oppose Britain and France, oppose the union with the Balkan countries, and advocate surrender to the German-Italian axis. The group's funds are subsidized by Germany. The internal organization is completely militarized. Members penetrate important government agencies, such as the General Staff, intelligence agencies, and major enterprises, and they all have their activities, and they report to the leader Codreanu on a regular basis.

### The Chinese United Front Decides Again: Li Huitang to Play Center Forward; Navy Team Lineup Also Announced Yesterday

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Regarding the selection of players for the Hua Ba United Team in the Li Wah Cup football preliminary round, the selection committee held another meeting yesterday and established a more complete lineup.

Undoubtedly, the selection committee members accepted this newspaper's suggestion. However, although Hou Chengtou and Song Lingsheng were selected, it is said that their foot injuries have not healed yet, and it is still unknown whether they will be able to play at the time. Therefore, all substitutes must be fully equipped and present at the field to prepare for temporary use. The selected lineup and substitutes are as follows:

Tan Jun'gan (South China Athletic Association)

Luo Weiquan (Eastern Athletic Association) Hou Rongsheng (Guanghua Athletic Association)

Xu Jingcheng (Eastern Athletic Association) Liang Rongzhao (South China Athletic Association) Song Lingsheng (Eastern Athletic Association)

Hou Chengtou (Eastern Athletic Association) Zou Wenzhi (Guanghua Athletic Association) Li Si (South China Athletic Association) Zhuo Shijin (Guanghua Athletic Association) Chen Bingtou (Eastern Athletic Association)

Substitutes: Li Deqi, Miao Huaguo, Liu Shidu, Liu Xianhan

Hui Zhongyun, Wu Qixiang (Eastern Athletic Association), Yang Zixiang

Zhong Huilin, Huang Jingcong (Guanghua Athletic Association)

Based on the current situation, the above lineup is satisfactory. As for the Navy Team's lineup, it was also announced yesterday and is arranged as follows:

Heather

Steedle, Burrows

Fraser, Dixon, Henyverall

Condie, Spillera, Henry, Tobin, Armstrong

Many people feel surprised that the Navy United did not select "Red-Haired" McAlister as goalkeeper. In fact, the red-haired guest has already gone with the ship, so Heather is used.

It seems that the strength of the Navy United is slightly inferior to that of the Chinese United. I predict that this time the Chinese United can be confident of victory and win the final. (The Football Field Grand Duke)

### South China's Southern Expedition Team Beats the Tân An Team by Four Goals; Goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai Performs Excellently

[Special Airmail Report from Saigon, 8th] Yesterday, at 4:00 PM on the 8th, South China played against the Vietnamese "Tân An Mixed Team" again, still held at the Saigon Stone Stadium. The Tân An Mixed is also a strong team here, with solid strength, and the audience expected a particularly exciting performance, so the number of people was no less than yesterday. The game started, and both sides moved their feet. The South China team had just charged up when a member of the Tân An team fell to the ground. His teammates helped him up, and he was able to fight again after a while. At this time, the South China team directly pressed the goal. The defenders worked hard to support, but the ball refused to move. Liu Qingcai advanced and retreated with certainty, with a force like crushing dry weeds. He quickly passed to Li Zhaorong to carry the ball forward. Chen Dexiong kicked it head-on and opened the scoring. The Tân An team suffered this blow in an instant and was unwilling to fall behind, so they launched a counterattack. The forwards advanced, but it was difficult to make progress. Da Tie Zhuo Zhenming defended the famous city, and also performed his customary bow technique, heading a top, even clearing the siege. The Tân An team became more and more motivated, making a comeback, but unfortunately they were brave but lacked strategy. Moreover, they were tackled to the ground and hooked the ball out. Soon, Liu Qingcai used guerrilla tactics, passing to Jingxiang. Yang Shuiyi rushed to receive the ball and shot it towards the opponent's goal, and another city fell. At this time, the Tân An team was exhausted, with only the ability to parry but not to counterattack. The South China team's three armies killed to the gate, but fortunately the goalkeeper was busy saving it, temporarily announcing safety. Although they wanted to counterattack, their way was blocked. Chen Deshi was as agile as a swimming dragon, dribbling the ball and flashing past the Tân An defender, passing to Jingxiang. They passed back and forth to each other. Jingxiang built another special service with a swallow-like tumbling, and the applause rose greatly. Before long, the Tân An team struggled again. Liu Songsheng got the pass, took advantage of the opponent's empty back and went straight in with a single knife, coming again, the silver whistle sounded long, and the first half ended. 4 to 0, the Tân An team was served a blank. The second half started, and the Tân An team tried to break the blank record, launching a large-scale counterattack, but it was still difficult to make progress in the middle. Feng Jingxiang waved his army to counterattack, turning it over to Songsheng, but his foot strength was too weak, and it was caught by the Tân An team's goalkeeper. The Tân An team took the opportunity to counterattack, and the South China team was awarded a corner kick. Fortunately, Li Zhaorong headed a swing, killing his way out of the siege. The Tân An team was also penalized soon after. The defenders Gao Yue headed it out. Before long, they counterattacked to the South China team's goal. Li and Mai, the two gates, were unable to save it. Fortunately, goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai pounced to the ground and caught it. Another member of the Tân An team took the opportunity to catch up, and Da Tie's shovel was pushed down. The referee declared it void, and after that, the Tân An team fought for a long time without a child. Da Tie never allowed them to cross the thunder pool half a step. At this time, South China was as solid as gold, calmly dealing with it. The Tân An team knew that the general trend had gone, and they had no intention of falling in love. 4 to 0, the Tân An team lost with a blank. In this battle, Zhang Rongcai performed the best in South China, Liu Qingcai and Li Guowei performed well, and the front line contributed greatly. The lineup is as follows (recorded by Zhu Zhaoheng)

South China Team

Zhang Rongcai, Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohuan, Li Guowei, Liu Qingcai, Liu Weipei, Liu Songsheng, Li Zhaorong, Chen Guohui, Feng Jingxiang, Yang Shuiyi

Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, and Luo Douwen each scored a goal. (According to this report, the team did not send a telegram. Yesterday, the reporter received an airmail from Zhu Zhaoheng, and only then did he know that the game had been completed, so I recorded it to inform those who care about football.)

### Shortcut to Fitness (3)

-- Wang Juzheng

Spirit and perseverance are the keys to understanding fitness. No pain, no gain! Hard work, a little effort, and a little sweat are the only way to achieve true fitness. There is no other shortcut.

When engaging in fitness exercises, if we want to achieve the greatest effect, we must not only concentrate, but also have the following spirits. If we lack this spirit, exercise will not only be useless, but harmful.

(1) Do not be perfunctory. The method must be absolutely correct, the movements must be thorough, and there should be a deep understanding of the exercise.

(2) When exercising, you must "immerse yourself in it."

(3) The spirit of hard work, performing the prescribed number of repetitions until fatigue, and then stopping. We may feel hardship when starting this kind of exercise, but after getting used to it, we will feel comfortable. Therefore, do not interrupt exercise if you feel slightly uncomfortable.

(4) The spirit of perseverance and continuous efforts. Exercise must have regularity and a uniform order.

(5) A spirit of progress and fearlessness, and do not shrink back due to slight difficulties.

(6) Do not have extravagant hopes, and do not rush exercise. You must "build a solid foundation." Extravagant hopes are often the mother of "discouragement."

Before introducing the second set of exercises to everyone, I want to remind everyone to "continue practicing each set of exercises for about three days or a week, and then switch to the next set of exercises." (To be continued)

### Film and Drama

Entertainment... Lone Wolf of Paris

Lone Wolf of Paris

The content is about a bizarre theft, with a touch of comedy. The plot is quite tortuous, but many climaxes in the film pass by ordinarily. It tells the story of a world-famous jewel thief who has reformed and no longer commits theft. However, in Paris, in order to help a princess of a small country recover the pearls on her crown, he again uses his skillful thieving techniques, matching wits with the good duke of Ou Zhu. The task is completed moments before the princess's younger brother is about to ascend the throne, allowing the young monarch to take his place.

French actors Sissier Telier and Francis Delain are both very competent in this film.

Queen... Highlights in Color Film

Walt Disney's pen-and-ink animation films are beloved and welcomed by every audience, especially after the success of his bold attempt with "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," which has drawn greater attention from movie enthusiasts. This screening of "Highlights in Color Film" selects and compiles his most recent works, a total of ten films, listed below:

"The Fox Hunt," "The Eccentric Parrot," "Livestock Symphony," "Golf Jokes," "Prince of the Crystal Palace," "Silver Star Fairytale," "Whaling Story," "Lucky Day," "The Indomitable Bull," "Giant's Tale"

The animation techniques, as well as the coordination of colors and sounds, are all exquisitely perfect. The stories are concise and lively, filled with rich humor. In addition to Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, there are also new creations. Among them, "The Indomitable Bull," "Prince of the Crystal Palace," "Silver Star Fairytale," and "Giant's Tale" are particularly outstanding.

Peace... Scipione l'Africano

Scipione L'Africano

This is a historical film depicting a magnificent foreign war in ancient Rome. The grandeur of the sets and scenes in the film is unmatched by any other. The magnificent palaces and temples, the bloody battles on the battlefield, the charge of thousands upon thousands of cavalry and infantry, the advance of the elephant battle team, and the spectacle of ancient warships vividly portray the war between the two nations of that era on the screen. From the perspective of film art, this film is a successful work. However, because the film features well-known stars as its main draw, and it is also an Italian production, entirely in Spanish.

East... Booloo

Booloo

Although it cannot be said to be completely shoddy, it is not particularly outstanding either. However, the background and subject matter of the story are somewhat novel compared to ordinary beast films. Director Grajahlier-Rak, with his considerable experience in directing beast films, handles this film acceptably.

### Physician Huang Zhuoru specializes in treating chronic toxic conditions that have not been cured by hundreds of treatments

The difficulty of treating toxic conditions is well known. Although there are various reasons, they are all due to toxic germs invading the urethral side ducts and surrounding tissues, so it is impossible to eradicate the invading toxic germs. Therefore, to treat toxic conditions, it is necessary to reach the base of the toxic germs, the urethral side ducts. In view of this, this physician uses a Yinzhen dilatation injection treatment device to suck out the toxic system from the side ducts, and then injects the liquid medicine. The urethral side ducts naturally attract, and at the same time, the mucosa will be congested. The germicidal effect is strong, promoting the absorption of the infiltration of diseased cells, and the toxic disease can be cured. If you have the same disease, why not give it a try.

Transportation and Travel

### From Lian County to Hong Kong -- Nearly 800 Li on Foot

-- Xi Shi

Before the fall of Guangzhou, transportation between Hong Kong and Guangdong was extremely convenient. Now it has become very difficult. In addition, many of the inland highways close to the war zone have been automatically destroyed. Travelers, no matter in terms of the extra waste of money, time, spirit, and physical strength, feel overwhelmed by the complexity. This writer first went south on New Year's Day of this year, starting from Lian County in northwestern Guangdong, passing through Yangshan, Qingyuan, Sihui, Gaoyao, Xinxing, Kaiping, Xinhui, and Zhongshan counties, crossing Macau and arriving in Hong Kong, spending ten days and two days. During this period, except for more than one hundred li where I was able to take a highway bus, the rest of the journey was on foot. Those who are not accustomed to the labor of trekking will greatly lament its suffering.

Lian County, formerly the seat of Qinglian Prefecture, is located on the upper reaches of the Lian River, the distribution center for goods on the Small North River. After the provincial government moved there at the end of last month, military and political leaders of Guangdong Province and celebrities from all walks of life gathered there. Its political, economic, and cultural status suddenly became important. Around the time of the fall of Guangzhou, enemy planes flew to various counties and cities in Guangdong Province and indiscriminately bombed them. It was the most tragic bombing since the "July 7th Incident." After the provincial government and various important organs of South China moved there, the enemy planes bombed it for the first time, resulting in more than two hundred deaths and injuries, and new ruins. Since then, the prosperous street market of the past has become a desolate and quiet county town during the day. The impact has been that the compatriots in nearby counties that have not been bombed are all frightened by the rumors of war. This is a good example of "facts speak louder than words" in anti-Japanese propaganda, awakening many of our farmers who are still living in a drunken stupor or are completely ignorant of the national situation.

Previously, the route between Guangzhou and Lian County was mainly via the Guangwu Railway, transferring to a private boat at Lianjiangkou Station. Secondly, one could take a steamer to Qingyuan County seat, then transfer to a highway bus to Baishitan in the county, and then walk through Yangshan County. Originally, the Qingyang Highway (from Qingyuan to Yangshan) was built several years ago, but only the above-mentioned section is open to traffic. The majority of the unbuilt route accounts for the bulk of it. The Lianyang area (Lian County, Lianzhou, Yangshan) is mountainous and remote in the northwest. Compared with the culture of the Pearl River Delta, it is like heaven and earth. Therefore, the need for transportation and the countless tasks awaiting development are very important. However, the completion of the highway is still a distant prospect. Before it was affected by the war in southern Guangdong, the Lian River was originally the waterway through which goods and travelers in the counties passed. However, because it is a tributary of the North River, it flows south all year round. The average water depth is not shallow, but there are many turbulent currents and dangerous shoals. Traveling downstream is occasionally unstable, and boats are easily overturned. If traveling upstream, the boatmen must walk along the riverbank and pull the boat with ropes. The shouts to widen the breath of urgent oppression of the boatmen as the wind transmits into the ears as well as the sight of the boatman leaning forward and desperately struggling as they pull the rope, it can be known that the price to be paid by the struggle between manpower and nature is great, and the effect is minimal. The traffic difficulties of the Small North River are evident here.

On New Year's Day, I took a boat downstream. The county towns of Lian County and Yangshan are about 110 li apart. With the help of the northwest wind, I arrived in five hours. There are two routes from the latter to Qingyuan Baishitan: one via Qi Gong Village and the other via Shuikou Market, divided into west and east branches. The former is longer and flatter, while the latter is shorter, but more rugged. For those who are not accustomed to long-distance walking, walking the 20-mile-long, rugged mountain road is indeed difficult, but there are still mountain sedan chairs available. The porters walk like flying, and their physical strength and tolerance for labor are impressive. They can reach it in ten hours, which is truly amazing and embarrassing for ordinary intellectuals. With the farmers' hard work and swift movements, if we can promptly implement progressive mass mobilization, and further strengthen the military and political training of the existing self-defense teams, once the enemy advances along the railway, they will be able to attack the enemy's left flank with fierce attacks without a doubt. When I passed through Yangshan County, I visited friends everywhere and inquired about county administration. There were many complaints. As far as wartime work is concerned, everyone is simply following orders and perfunctorily doing their jobs. I heard that the slogans recently posted in the county town are said to be dazzling and beautiful, but the reason for this is that the supervisory group of the Political Department of the Fourth War Zone suddenly arrived. This is also one of the most wonderful decorations in the rear during wartime.

After arriving in Qingyuan County seat by Qingyang Highway, what I saw along the way was no longer the slackness of the aforementioned places in preparing for the anti-Japanese war in the rear. At least the spirit of the general compatriots in life is more tense. Regardless of whether this superficial observation contains more or less content related to the impact of the anti-Japanese war, it made me feel a lot. Fortunately, the Qingyang Highway from Baishitan south is not only still undamaged, but there are also buses running on schedule, saving more than 90 li of walking. The Qingyuan Garrison Commander's patrol sentry along the line carried out traffic inspections as many as nine times. If any traveler is deemed suspicious, they will be thoroughly searched, and they will have to deal with various interrogations. If they are carrying luggage, it will be even more dizzying. However, in this extraordinary period, Qingyuan County seat is more than 100 li away from Sanshui. How dare good citizens not abide by the order of the rear? However, the special inspection can be carried out quite satisfactorily by following two principles: (1) being adept at questioning suspicious people, and (2) being quick at general inspections, so as not to be in two minds. (To be continued)

### Regulations for Cargo Loading on Shanghai-Ningbo Vessels: Fares to be Reduced, China-Italy Shipping Company Takes the Lead, Authorities Approve Direct Shanghai-Ningbo Route

[Shanghai Correspondence] Although the principle of allowing direct cargo release from Ningbo to Shanghai upon merchants' request has been approved, detailed measures are pending review by the county government, party headquarters, and chambers of commerce. Now, the China-Italy Shipping Company's Enderun, American Weilihan Company's Xinanna, German Xiangyang Company's Moufu, Ningshao Company's agent for British Kaibo, and Huimin Company's agent for British Xixiangtai have all been approved by the Tenth Army Group Headquarters to operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. However, before direct release is finalized, direct Shanghai-Ningbo (routes) are temporarily prohibited. Vessels must first sail to Daotai, Taizhou, and Wenzhou before entering Ningbo, primarily to load cargo. (1) Moufu specializes in silk. (2) Kaibo specializes in cotton. (3) Xixiangtai specializes in local paper. (4) Enderun and Xinanna specialize in local goods. The four vessels, Xixiangtai, Xinanna, Moufu, and Enderun, are scheduled to depart from Shanghai to Taizhou or Wenzhou and then to Ningbo tomorrow. When departing from Shanghai, in addition to passengers bound for Taizhou, they will also load goods approved for import into Zhejiang Province. The designated transportation vessels for the Wenzhou-Taizhou-Ningbo line are the Meida and Tangsai.

Reduced Water Transport Costs, Calculated at Half Price

Regarding the freight charges for each vessel, due to the soaring coal prices after the war, increased costs, and the detour involved, the Shanghai-Ningbo passenger ticket prices have continued to rise, causing a sudden increase in the burden on merchants and travelers from eastern Zhejiang. Therefore, Zhou Dalie, the chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, previously sent a letter requesting a reduction. After the news spread to Shanghai, Jing Hui, Zhu Meixian, and others from the local NingShao Shipping Company were the first to respond and immediately telegraphed the joint conference of the county's party, government, military, and police, requesting approval for direct Shanghai-Ningbo routes to reduce the companies' expenses, which would then lead to lower freight charges. Now, the China-Italy Shipping Company, considering the merchants' difficulties and facilitating cargo transportation, plans to take the lead in implementing a reduction. The company's Enderun, which is sailing to Ningbo today, will offer a 50% discount on all passenger and freight fares upon its return to Shanghai. It is reported that all customs brokers and passengers have been notified. It is also heard that other companies will follow suit.

### Guangxi Province Highway Construction (1)

— Pan Taifeng

and its scenery along the route

1. Introduction

For more than a decade, the model provinces in China have been promoted as Shanxi and Guangxi. However, Guangxi's initial construction started more than a decade later than Shanxi Province. Nevertheless, its achievements have progressed rapidly and surpassed them. Taking highways as an example, the branches and trunks are crisscrossed, and wheeled vehicles reach everywhere. The past rugged paths have become smooth roads. The long journeys of the past are now completed from morning to evening. This has a significant impact on the implementation of government orders, the flow of goods, the dissemination of culture, and national defense construction. When the people of the country are shocked by the speed of Guangxi's construction progress, they should know that the success is largely due to the highways.

2. History

The start of Guangxi's roads can be traced back to the Yongwu Road in 1915, from Yongning to Wuming, a length of 41.2 kilometers. The project was started by the Army Engineering Battalion dispatched by the former General Headquarters. Later, due to military affairs, it was interrupted from time to time. In 1919, the first automobile was acquired. Later, the political situation stabilized, and the road administration was not repaired. Only a section from Yongning to Wutang was built in 1921, and the existing Nanan Highway was simply paved in 1922. Since 1924, the project has gradually become active. After 1928, it became more active. The principle of road construction was to first seek communication and then gradually improve. Therefore, roads were divided into sections and carried out simultaneously. However, due to the different difficulty of the projects and the different lengths of the routes, the roads could not be completed at the same time, and the routes were not connected. At that time, in order to quickly achieve traffic, districts were established to be responsible for the management of the entire district's engineering and traffic. The entire province had five districts: Ning, Liujiang, Guilin, Rong, and Nanning, all directly under the Construction Department. In November 1930, in response to environmental needs, the Liujiang and Guilin districts were changed to a contract system. In June 1932, the Provincial Highway Bureau was established, and all district management bureaus and contractor systems were abolished. The road administration of the entire province began to be unified. In terms of engineering, both branch and trunk lines were advanced simultaneously, and attention was paid to connecting roads in neighboring provinces to attach to the national highway system. For example, the Daliu Line from Datang through Yishan, Hechi to Liuzhai, which is the main line of the current Southwest Highway, was also completed at that time. In terms of traffic, postal applications were first launched in January 1932 to facilitate transportation. Initially, there were only eight cars. In July of the following year, due to business needs, the number of vehicles was greatly increased, and postal vehicles were changed to long-distance buses. The management of commercial vehicles was also regulated. For example, road maintenance fees and ticket fees had unified prices. Since then, active management has yielded remarkable results. In addition to new-style stations in major cities, small stations and military stops have also been gradually built, and repair shops have been set up in Yongning, Binyang, and Liuzhou. For the rivers Huaiji, Ermenjiang, Qingshuijiang, Honghe, Rongjiang, and Yongjiang, where the river surface is vast and iron bridges could not be built, wharfs were built on both sides to facilitate the loading of vehicles. As of March last year, the total number of public and private vehicles reached 756, of which 278 belonged to the Highway Administration Bureau, an increase of 32 times compared with seven years ago. There were 279 vehicles belonging to the Automobile United Business Association, 50 vehicles belonging to the automobile companies of each county, and 149 vehicles belonging to other public and private institutions and private individuals. Calculated by the proportion of the population of the province, there is one car for every 14,000 people. Although it is not comparable to the United States, where there is one car for every four people, it can be considered the leader among the inland provinces.

3. Detailed Description of Each Route

It has been said that construction and politics, economy, and culture have mutual causal effects. Progress in construction often provides great convenience for promoting politics, culture, and economy. At the same time, political clarity often benefits construction. Guangxi's politics have boasted the "three richnesses and three autonomies" policy to the world, so its people are rich in organizational power and enthusiastically participate in public works. When the earthwork for each road begins, it is necessary to first investigate the able-bodied men aged 18 to 40 along the route. The village chiefs or equivalent personnel in each section are assigned as section chiefs, and a certain number of able-bodied men are gathered into groups, with 50 people in each group, and a specific section is designated to be completed within a limited time. Although the wages are meager (each worker receives a food allowance of 15 cents per day, with 73 cubic feet completed per day considered one worker), sometimes they are all voluntary, but there are almost no cases of escape. The land requisitioned from the people is generally not paid for, except for the exemption of grain, and there are few complaints. This is not possible without daily training. The success of Guangxi's road administration has its origins.

3. Detailed Description of Each Route

As of now, the total length of highways in the province is approximately 5,300 kilometers, of which approximately 3,100 kilometers belong to provincial roads (including the 329 kilometers from Liuzhou to Liuzhai, which is now included in the national highway category), 2,900+ kilometers are open to traffic, and approximately 2,100 kilometers belong to county roads, 500+ are open to traffic. The following is a description of the provincial roads that are open to traffic, approximately 2,900+ kilometers, for the convenience of writing, based on the starting points of each line, divided into four centers: Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, and Yongning.

The purpose of road construction is to facilitate people's travel. However, as society evolves, the needs of all parties gradually change. Therefore, the choice of route must be determined by what special value it has in order to fully utilize its effectiveness. Guangxi's highways initially aimed to promote politics, military affairs, and culture, and later focused on economy, to clear trade and adjust needs. Therefore, the resources and products of the cities along the route are also briefly described. This is one aspect.

Building scenery, promoting tourism, and attracting tourists to increase national income invisibly have been recognized by world economists. According to statistics, after the European War, European countries earned tens of millions of US dollars annually from American tourists. Looking back at China, the most earned in a year was only 6 million US dollars. This is because traffic was previously blocked, making it difficult to travel, causing famous mountains and beautiful waters to be unknown to the world. This is truly regrettable. The scenery of Guangxi is also the same. Now that the highways are smooth, the scenic spots along each route should be listed to inform travelers of where they are traveling, to alleviate the fatigue of long journeys, and to contribute to the national economy. This is the second aspect.

The quality of highway engineering has a significant impact on the safety, speed, and fuel consumption of vehicles. Therefore, the condition of each broken bridge, road surface, slope, and road is also briefly described. This is the third aspect.

Guilin is the capital of Guangxi Province. The city was built by Li Jing of the Tang Dynasty. It is located on the west bank of the Tan River, with a population of more than 100,000. People from Hunan are quite numerous. The prosperous commercial streets are in the southeastern part of the city. The nearby agricultural products include water chestnuts, hemp, tea, mushrooms, lily bulbs, pomelos, longan, persimmons, tobacco, and tung oil. Water chestnuts are particularly famous, with a sweet taste and no residue, with an annual output of more than 120,000 dans. The weaving industry has more than 400 households, weaving more than 290,000 bolts per year. The best is Liutang cloth, which is sold to northern Guizhou in addition to self-use. The bamboo weaving industry is also famous, with more than 400 households, producing more than 90,000 bundles per year, which are mostly sold to other places, as far as Tianjin. In addition, Guilin Yihua wine, with its mellow taste, is famous far and wide, with more than 40 households brewing it.

Guilin is located on a high ground about 208 meters above sea level, standing on the mountains and enjoying beautiful scenery. The most famous mountain is Duxiu Peak, which stands independently and proudly in the city. Yan Yanzhi used to study there and wrote the special "Not as good as Duxiu Peak, towering between the city walls". The name of Duxiu Peak originated from this. Lishan, commonly known as Elephant Trunk Hill, is where the Yang River (the upper source of the Xiang River) and the Li River converge. There is a cave at the foot of the mountain called Water Moon, with the Li River running through it. Other mountains such as Douji Mountain, Chuan Mountain, Crescent Mountain, Longyin Rock, Qili Mountain, Putuo Rock in the east of the city, Fubo Rock, Yaoshan in the northeast, Yushan in the north, and Yinshan in the west are all green cliffs and beautiful. Truly, there are so many beautiful things that one cannot see them all. Due to space limitations, they cannot be described in detail. Historical sites such as the Caiyan Rock on Guashan Mountain, where the loyal ministers of the Ming Dynasty, Zhang Tongchang and Qu Shiyu, were martyred, the Dahuangcheng, where the King of Gui established his capital, the Han Dynasty General Fubo Mountain, the Yushan Mountain dedicated to Yu Shun, and the Zhennan Peak, which houses the Dali Pingman stone carvings, are especially precious.

### Developed Inter-Provincial Trade Among Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi Provinces: Exchange of Goods to Smooth the Source

[Fuzhou Correspondence] The inter-provincial trade between Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces has developed greatly after the efforts of the authorities of the four provinces to promote it. For example, the transportation of slab sugar from Guangdong to Jiangxi and the separate transportation of local tobacco from western Fujian to Jiangxi and Guangdong are especially in short supply. Recently, due to Jiangxi Province's poor harvest last year and surplus grain, there is a severe shortage of food salt. The Inter-Provincial Trade Commission sent personnel to Fujian to discuss the exchange of Jiangxi rice for Fujian salt. Currently, salt prices in Fujian Province have gradually increased, with rice prices rising from five or six yuan per dan to eight or nine yuan, and salt prices rising from seven or eight yuan per dan to twelve or thirteen yuan, which is proof of smooth roads. The daily necessities of Fujian are all transported from Chaozhou and Shantou, which keeps prices stable. Salt affairs affect people's livelihoods. The reason is that the traffic between Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, whether direct or indirect, is very convenient, so goods can be exchanged, and the source can be smoothed. Recently, Jiangxi, eastern Guangdong, and western Fujian have made further connections. In addition to the direct remittance implemented by the branch offices of the three provincial banks in the border counties, with a remittance fee of five cents per hundred yuan, the banknotes issued by the three banks can also be used interchangeably to seek financial flow. In addition, the administrative commissioners of the border areas of the three provinces will each send representatives to set up barter trade measures. For any kind of industry or commerce that a province lacks, the industrial and commercial provinces are welcome to take the lead in operating it, and guarantees will be provided. For example, in the eighth administrative region, in villages such as Qidu, Qidu, Qidong, and counties such as Huichang, business people engaged in hardware, printing, cloth, and paper are often welcomed to take the lead in operating. In addition to absolutely safeguarding safety, they can also help hire boats, order vehicles, and rent houses and land. If merchants have difficult matters, they can submit them to the local county government, which will forward them to the relevant county government of the province for consultation.

### Concerning War

— A Commoner

The Second World War is gradually brewing in every corner of the earth, with approximately 600 million people already engulfed in the flames of war. In the frenzied and greedy rampage of fascism, it is evident that the chaotic situation, even more so than in 1914, is unavoidable.

War, how ordinary and yet mysterious a thing it is in the minds of ordinary people!

Those inclined towards fatalism say that war is a product of "heavenly principles in cycles," therefore, the occurrence of war is inevitable, unconditional, and irreversible, because: "There is no power to reverse fate," "Those destined to suffer calamity cannot escape."

The idealists' "view of war," however, is completely different. They believe that the occurrence of war is a completely accidental political aberration, that is, a mere sudden shift in social ideology.

The former exaggerates the inevitability of war and mythologizes it, believing that this "cycle" of "heavenly principles" is immutable, and that mankind can only be arbitrarily manipulated in this cyclical phase, "given life or death, subject to their whims," and therefore presents a passive state in war, indulging in dissipation, pleasure-seeking, and seeking temporary security, unaware of the nation-state, and even less understanding of the "door to survival."

The latter does not deeply see the causes of war. For example, in the case of China's war of resistance, in their eyes, it is purely caused by the excessive excitement of the Chinese people during the July 7th Incident. If they had been more moderate at the time, then this major upheaval could have been calmed down. Now, China's insistence on resistance in their eyes is also due to the general public's "unabated anger" and "stubbornness," neglecting the "peaceful" spirit of "calmness and tranquility" and "mutual support."

Both of the above concepts are a complete misunderstanding or distortion of the true meaning of war.

Because war is not a cycle of worldly affairs, but an evolution of worldly affairs. War is the change in social forms in a certain stage of historical dialectical development. History is made by people, of course, war is also man-made: Inequality between people and groups of people incites war. At the same time, war ends when equality is achieved through the efforts and struggles of people. However, this is not an immutable equilibrium or a state of flux; after the destruction of each war, construction follows, and continuing in a certain peaceful situation, new inequalities arise to a high degree and then war erupts. In the midst of each peaceful day's comings and goings, people's culture progresses. At the same time, in each process of war's occurrence and end, the content of human society also leaps forward.

Since war is a change in social forms, the inevitability that determines the outbreak and unfolding of war is still the content and essence of society. It is as if the World War of 1914 was due to the division of imperialists. The reason for this division was determined by the high degree of development of capitalism in each country, and the high degree of development of capitalism was due to the contradiction between the productive forces and the relations of production in its social essence. It is even more like today's Chinese War of Resistance, which is a struggle for liberation unfolded under the high pressure of Japanese imperialism under the historical realities of feudalism. The essence of Chinese society makes China stand in a semi-colonial position, and at the same time, its development also makes China struggle upward from the position of a semi-colony. On the other hand, the Japanese fascists' aggression against China is also because the evolution of their own domestic exploitation system has to seek markets abroad. In short, all wars have their essential differences. Today, our War of Resistance is not some "Thirty Years' War" or some "Hundred Years' War"-like war of the feudal era. The wars in the feudal era were completed and perfectly resolved in fulfilling their missions. Our war must also be resolved under the principle of the liberation and victory of our nation, rather than using the abstract concepts of "peace," "support," and "non-aggression" as preconditions for resolving war.

We resolutely oppose all distortions and misunderstandings of war. We must vigorously refute those erroneous arguments that are issued with malicious intentions, and prevent their toxins from being injected into the masses.

Now, war has been widely unfolded in China and Spain, and at the same time, other places are also filled with a strong smell of gunpowder. We are not at all alarmed or shaken by the cruel expansion of war. We only calmly observe it with our correct perspective, and constantly prepare and deal with it:

Regarding the war that has already come or is unfolding, our basic attitude is to take "national liberation" and "human liberation" as the highest principles for resolving war. However, it is impossible to seek the adjustment and resolution of war through compromise and abstract "peace." We should possess the great spirit of "fighting for true peace through war" and "eliminating war with war" to strive for an independent, free, and happy new China! And strive for the coming of a new era of equality!

### Random Notes from the Countryside

— Li Yiyan

The Dapeng small ferry sailed into Shayu Chung. The gate on the ship opened. On the left was the coast, and many people on this side stood up, gazing anxiously. I also stood up and looked out from the opening, seeing a stretch of golden sandy beach on the opposite side.

"Arrived! Arrived!" Someone shouted like this, and the whole ship suddenly stirred, scrambling to pick up their luggage.

The water was shallow dozens of feet from the shore, and the steamer could not move forward. It swung its tail and slowly moved, waiting for the small boat to come and ferry the passengers.

Due to the commotion of the passengers, the steamer rocked, tilting.

"Hey!..." Someone exclaimed in surprise, afraid that the ship would capsize and sink. Because the passengers were too crowded, this worry did not seem excessive. Especially for those who took this ferry for the first time, they could not help but be frightened.

The first small boat arrived beside the ship. Passengers rushed to the gate, hoping to leave the ship quickly, get on the small boat quickly, and land quickly. Those who were single and had little luggage naturally had the advantage. The five of us traveling together did not have much luggage, so it would have been possible to leave quickly; but we were carrying three boxes of medicine together, which were heavier than anyone else's luggage, and it was not easy to move them down to the small boat, so we had to let others go first.

Several small boats rowed over one after another. The larger ones could hold more than twenty people, and the smallest ones could only hold five or six people, including the boat woman (there were few boatmen). With several stone people on the ship, relying on these few small boats to ferry in turn took too much time. At first, we planned to let them all leave before leaving; but we still had to travel fifty or sixty miles to get to Danshui. Seeing this situation, we didn't know how long we would have to wait, and felt that we couldn't wait any longer. Seeing a gap, we quickly dragged the medicine box to the gate. The crew member saw that it was emergency medicine and also helped us stop others, letting us pass the medicine box down to the small boat first. However, the small boat was already full of people, and it was difficult to find a foothold. Comrade Huang reluctantly jumped down, lying on the medicine box. The four of us could no longer jump down, so we had to wait for another small boat.

Soon, another small boat came, but it was very small. There were two boat women on the boat originally. Looking at the remaining space, it seemed that it could not accommodate all four of us. The crew member told me not to go down again; but I wanted to accompany them, and finally risked jumping down. As soon as our feet landed on the plank, the small boat left the ship.

"Don't move—don't move—moving will cause it to sink!" The boat woman at the bow shouted loudly.

My position was at the bow, and I had not yet straightened my body. It was neither sitting nor squatting, a most uncomfortable posture. But watching the undulating small boat, wrestling with the turbulent waves of the sea, how could I move even a bit—

The small boat reached its destination, resting aground. I was the first to stand up. There was still tide water under the bow and I could not jump down; in an instant, the tide retreated backward, and I quickly jumped down and then quickly fled forward. Looking back, the tide rushed to the place where I had just landed. The second to jump down was Mr. Liao, who also jumped after making sure the tide had retreated; but after he jumped down, his movements were not agile, and his feet had not yet left, and the tide rushed up again, so his pair of shoes got wet. ...

Thank goodness, we finally safely stepped onto the land, and can start our work.

### Diary of a Military March

— Li Huiying

Because we had a female comrade traveling with us, the news quickly spread throughout this small village with less than ten households. So, with an attitude of watching a novelty, men, women, old and young all rushed to the hillside; at first, some felt that the female soldier was strange, but later they struck up a conversation with each other, and the more they talked, the closer they became. On the contrary, they felt that this female soldier was kind and respectable.

"What should we do when the Japanese soldiers come?"

When we raised this question, we really did not expect that Mr. Yu would answer so firmly: "Fight—fight as guerrillas—we can't escape anymore when we get to our hometown!"——Experience, the training of the times!——"Is it not good to organize now?"

"It was originally well organized, and the county was asked to issue guns, but not only were the guns not issued, but even the guerrillas were disbanded; it was said that before the place was occupied, it could not be established, but in fact, alas——"

He sighed and stopped talking, but his son, a young man who had studied at a Nanjing middle school, spoke out!

"I heard that the people above are afraid. Are they still afraid of the masses at this time? Damn it——" (To be continued)

### Paying Respects to the Souls in the Northwest from Afar

— Qiu Yang

"Brother Jian Gong was bombed to death by enemy planes in Jixian County, I am deeply grieved—" These words jumped into my eyes in the dim twilight, proving that this was not a dream, that this was clearly a true and tragic fact. I looked to the northwest corner from afar, bleak with dark, heavy clouds of sorrow, the mournful north wind, as if bringing the pungent smell of blood. My heart, at first felt endless pain like being stabbed with a knife, and finally surged up with a fire of unknown anger. I do not shed tears, I do not mourn, I want to avenge the deep hatred of the sea of blood, I want to advance along the bloodstains of the dead!

I met Mr. Wen in the autumn three years ago. At that time, I began to get close to social sciences, and read his political economy and some very good philosophy books. Asking about them, I learned that he was our fellow villager, a very active, struggling young man who had been in prison and had been a university professor. But he had always been in the north, and I had no chance to meet him. Last spring, on a snowy day, I began to shake hands with him for the first time upstairs at No. 16 Yicheng Dongli, Danfeng Street, Hankou. The most profound impression he left on me was that he had the tall stature of a northerner, a very argumentative and erudite gentleman. He had absolute optimism about the victory of the War of Resistance, and he also had very active, resolute, and courageous actions in the War of Resistance. At that time, he had just come to Hankou from the front line of Shanxi Province, and he wanted to go back again, but because of certain problems, he could not realize his plan to go back. To us, he told many valuable experiences and methods of conducting ourselves in the world, and also encouraged us to study hard. He had forward-thinking thoughts and a fiery passion. Facing him, I felt that he had a solemn and great aura, and at the same time, I felt that he was a kind person who was very easy to approach and cared about us.

I still remember: one snowy afternoon, he sent me north, personally going to the Huo Dong Station in Dazhi Dou. Because the train would not leave until tomorrow morning, he invited me to a coffee shop that night to see me off. He earnestly instructed me with many good words, and also introduced me to many famous figures in the cultural world, telling me to find them for help or get to know them after I went to the distant northern country. On the quiet streets at midnight, when we returned from Jianghan Road together, he also kindly gave me two cans of biscuits and canned food. On Jianghan 1st Road, I saw him disappear into the black corner before I returned to my apartment—the Huagong Hotel. I thought that this farewell was temporary. After the victory of the War of Resistance, we could always see him again and learn from him. Who would have thought that the last handshake on Jianghan Road was the eternal farewell.

After arriving in the north, I did not send him a letter because of the obstruction of transportation. However, I knew from the mouths of friends that he was a design committee member of a certain department. Later, I heard that he had returned to Guangzhou. In early August, I returned to Hankou, and at the same time, I knew that he would come to Hankou. I waited for him to come every day, until August 12th. (I was preparing to leave for Hengyang at 6 pm that day.) That morning happened to be when enemy planes bombed Wuhan heavily. I was taking refuge in the French Concession, and unfortunately, he came to find me during this tense time. According to the mother, when he knew that I was afraid of enemy planes and was escaping, he smiled, saying that he would come again at night. It just so happened that I had to leave Hankou that day, and I didn't have the chance for a final meeting. Now, I silently think of his smile, probably thinking that I was afraid of death. Or perhaps he was laughing at my childish state? I can't guess what he was thinking. Now, I can only forever cherish his smile!

Farewell—Mr. Wen! In the bitter cold northwest corner, there are countless Chinese sons and daughters who have already followed your bloodstains to complete your unfinished cause of saving the country, exterminating the enemy and avenging your deep hatred and the deep hatred of so many martyred compatriots. We believe that the youth of our next generation will not disappoint you! We will definitely be able to save our China and drive the enemy out of China! Rest in peace! Mr. Wen! Written at 7 pm on January 14, 1939

### Random Thoughts on "Counting White Olives"

— Xin Ding

For the sake of the issue of writing for the countryside, everyone has put forward many valuable opinions. It seems that now is not the time for "theoretical" exploration, but should be the time to move on to "technical" research. Today, seeing He Hua'an's "Writing for the Countryside and Folk Literature," reminded me of the style of folk literature called "Counting White Olives," and I felt that it was worth promoting, so I will talk about it briefly.

I don't know when "Counting White Olives" began, but it is often used in Cantonese opera. As a kind of "dialogue" with rhythm and beat, inserting this clear and pleasant "white" dialogue into the tight and strict gongs and drums is very helpful to the effectiveness of the drama. The evaluation of Cantonese opera in terms of artistic guard is set aside for the time being, but Cantonese opera is loved by the masses in the south, and "Counting White Olives" is especially welcomed universally, which is an iron fact. Therefore, "Counting White Olives" can be separated from the shackles of drama and stand alone. Street performers and small vendors who sell snacks often use the method of "Counting White Olives" in order to be unique and attract customers, using the clapper to beat out the rhythm and singing interesting rhyming sentences to praise his goods. As a result, his business often gets unexpected gains.

This illustrates the value of "Counting White Olives."

However, perhaps some people doubt whether this thing that is liked by coolies and servants can ascend to the "Hall of Elegance"? If there are people who have this doubt, they will ignore the fact that old bottles can be filled with new wine; in fact, the question is whether we have "new wine," whether there are people who are willing to offer wine. I used to do propaganda work in a certain rural area. In a "spare time" in a commemorative meeting, I invited local villagers to try a "Counting White Olives" with new content, which won warm applause and requests for "one more." Recently, at the poetry recitation and New Year's Eve party of the Chinese Arts Association in Hong Kong, Mr. Luo Ying performed "Counting White Olives" with the new theme of current affairs report, which also received a good evaluation.

Analytically, the reason why "Counting White Olives" is welcomed by the masses is probably for the following reasons:

1.  It has rhythm and rhyme (at least it also has rhyme in the foot), which is pleasing to the ear.

2.  The language is colloquial, close to the lives of the masses, and easy to understand.

3.  Most of them are satirical and humorous.

4.  It comes with Cantonese opera, and the content (in the past) contains a strong feudal consciousness, catering to the taste of the "old heads."

However, perhaps someone may doubt "Although 'Counting White Olives' is colloquial enough, it is not serious enough." Yes, the position of "Counting White Olives" in the past in opera contains the meaning of adjusting the audience's mental fatigue and increasing the audience's deep understanding of the plot, so it is better to take it lightly than to be too serious; but now we take the "Counting White Olives" out of the nest of Cantonese opera, and the "new wine" that is infused is full of the consciousness of resisting aggression, then] the content determines the form, and the new "Counting White Olives," although it has a light habit, does not hinder its seriousness.

"Counting White Olives" needs to be promoted by cultural people, and cultural people need to carry out the work of "reform." Comrades who are working in the countryside, I hope you don't forget to bring this bottle of new wine with you!
