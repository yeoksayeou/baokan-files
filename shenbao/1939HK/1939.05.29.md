### Strengthening Japan's Policy Towards Third Countries

Recent developments in Japan's foreign policy involve the active and reckless actions of military personnel stationed abroad, backed and supported by domestic public opinion. The Japanese military's mouthpiece and its affiliated newspapers have extensively discussed the new direction of Japan's policy towards third countries, concluding that a hardline approach is necessary. This is a response to the setbacks of the Japanese military's aggression in China, which has reached a point where further advancement is difficult. However, they are shifting the blame onto third countries. While the Japanese government constantly dreams of adjusting diplomatic relations in all aspects, its military personnel abroad are venting their anger on foreign nations due to the military stalemate. They believe that China is resisting Japan with the support and protection of Britain, America, and France. Therefore, their first step is to eliminate the influence of these countries in China. This is not just an issue of economic interests; they are particularly concerned about political matters. They aim to strictly blockade the Chinese coast, disregarding international conventions and arbitrarily detaining and inspecting ships from third countries. Furthermore, they are actively seeking to invade third country concessions in China. They have been causing disturbances in Tianjin and Shanghai for quite some time, and although Britain, America, and France have expressed strong opposition to the landing incident in Gulangyu, the situation remains deadlocked. Now, the dispute over concessions is no longer merely a temporary issue, and following the reckless actions of the military, the Japanese government seems inclined to adopt new measures.

The nature of Japanese capitalism often causes its foreign policy to follow a path of reversal, similar to the development process of its domestic politics and economy. That is, political economics advance along with the military. Military personnel stationed abroad often disregard the policies of their domestic government and adopt their own independent measures. For example, regardless of how high-profile the Hiranuma cabinet's calls for "friendship with all nations" are, or how much Foreign Minister Arita flirts with the American ambassador, or even how urgently Japan currently needs material support from Britain and America, they stubbornly insist on excluding the economic and even political interests of Britain, America, and France. They consistently aim to create so-called "faits accomplis" first, and then leave the diplomatic authorities to negotiate.

Behind military actions, they incite public opinion to echo their views. Under the surveillance and command of the military's bayonets, newspapers that echo the military's outrageous statements are no longer limited to the military's mouthpiece, such as "国民新闻," or its affiliated "读卖新闻." Even "朝日新闻," which has traditionally maintained a more moderate stance, has now put forward hardline proposals. According to some sources, "朝日新闻" has even suggested three ways to deal with the concessions of third countries in China: (1) Allowing the puppet government to reclaim all foreign concessions; (2) Amending the land regulations; (3) Maintaining the status quo while requiring all countries to cooperate with Japan, which in other words means increasing Japan's position. Its conclusion is that the third method has failed, and the second method has not made any progress. Therefore, the first method should be adopted immediately.

They even emphasize that adopting the first method is feasible because there are precedents. Therefore, they are preparing to seize the concessions of third countries in China by force, absolutely excluding their interests. What is particularly surprising is that the Minseito party, which has traditionally represented the interests of the industrial bourgeoisie, is now also advocating a tough stance on foreign policy. This further demonstrates that Japanese politics often follows the military's lead, while also reflecting the internal contradictions and complexities of politics.

However, we must remind ourselves that this reckless behavior of Japan's military, which prioritizes military power, still carries elements of risk and probing. This has always been their style. The outbreak of the "September 18th Incident" may not have been the foreign policy of the Japanese government at the time. Therefore, Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara still emphasized the theory of "swallowing the bomb." Military probing must succeed before diplomacy can step in to negotiate. Japanese militarists are once again revisiting many old dreams. How Britain, America, and France, which have now become the targets of their probing, should deal with Japan is an important issue. If they cannot respond to this probing with "armored fists" (as Masataka Nakano said), the danger ahead is unimaginable.

### Educational Issues During the War of Resistance

— Chen Lifu

We must understand that a nation can only embark on the path of national rejuvenation through effective education. The work of "Resisting Japan and Building the Nation" is like constructing a great project. Before the project begins, there must be a precise plan, including the phasing of the project, the allocation of materials, and the estimation of labor. Then, a detailed engineering drawing should be prepared, and the "chief engineer" should lead many skilled workers to work hard to complete this great project. Today, our "chief engineer" for nation-building is our supreme leader, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and the general youth are the skilled workers of the future. The Three Principles of the People are the overall engineering drawings, and the Outline of National Reconstruction is the phasing diagram of the project. It divides the project into three stages: military administration, political tutelage, and constitutional government, to complete the solid foundation of nation-building. The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction are the detailed drawings of each part of the project. They tell us how many miles of railways and highways are needed, and how to develop mineral resources, improve agriculture, and develop water conservancy and industry, and so on. Therefore, under the leadership of the chief engineer, Generalissimo Chiang, we should deeply explore and understand the various conditions of the project—nation-building—especially the entire engineering drawing—the Three Principles of the People. This is very important in the current stage. Our Three Principles of the People were invented through Premier Sun's forty years of revolutionary experience and theoretical research. They encompass ancient Chinese political philosophy and the refinement of various schools of Western political thought. Now, the planner of our overall engineering drawing—Premier Sun—has passed away, and his successor—Generalissimo Chiang—is working hard to lead the people of the whole country—especially the general youth—to shoulder the sacred task of resisting Japan and building the nation.

Speaking of which, the responsibility of the general youth is so great! To enable the general youth to fulfill their responsibilities, we cannot but talk about education. The sages told us the importance of the four characters "管" (control), "教" (teach), "養" (nurture), and "衛" (protect), because in everything in the world, if you want to achieve the goal of success, you cannot escape these four characters. If we want to save China and revive the nation, we also rely entirely on these four characters as the foundation. In other words, these four characters are the fundamental conditions that must be met to complete the great cause of nation-building. Now, I will explain their meanings separately:

The first goal of education is "自治治事" (self-governance and managing affairs), that is, to enable the educated to be able to, first, self-govern, second, govern others, and third, manage affairs. However, society is inherently complex and prone to evil. People's surroundings contain great attraction. In physics, it is said that "attraction arises when two objects are together," and its formula is 　 Mencius also said, "Objects attract each other." Living in the universe, people naturally cannot avoid being attracted by external forces. Buddhism says that the six senses of eyes, ears, mouth, nose, body, and mind are the six desires, which are most likely to have causes and conditions with external forces. The more extravagant a person's desires are, the greater the effect of external forces. Once seduced by external forces, they lose their ability to self-govern and are controlled by external forces. As a result, corruption, fraud, bribery, and all kinds of evils arise, without end. Therefore, the primary goal of today's education is to cultivate young people's ability to "自治" (self-govern), "治人" (govern others), and "治事" (manage affairs) to control external forces, rather than being controlled by them, to change the environment, rather than being changed by the environment, and to ensure that they can "富貴不能淫" (not be corrupted by wealth), "貧賤不能移" (not be swayed by poverty), and "威武不能屈" (not be subdued by force). Everyone knows that Yan Hui was Confucius's favorite disciple. When Yan Hui died, Confucius was extremely saddened. Why? Because Yan Hui was able to control himself, simplifying his own life and not being tempted by things, and diligently serving others without getting tired. "A basket of rice, a gourd of water, living in a humble alley, others cannot bear the sorrow, but Yan Hui does not change his joy." This is proof of Yan Hui's noble personality, and it is also why Confucius loved and respected him. Mencius also said: "The way of learning is nothing but to seek one's lost mind." Only when a person can control his mind can he talk about self-governance. Only when one can self-govern can he manage others and gain their respect. Otherwise, if one is corrupt himself but tells others not to be corrupt, if one does not share joys and sorrows with the soldiers but asks them to endure hardship, that is absolutely impossible. Didn't the ancients say it? "If one is upright, he will be followed without orders; if one is not upright, he will not be followed even with orders." During the retreat from Wuhan, our supreme leader set an example by leaving Hankou only after everyone else had evacuated. This is such a great expression of personality. The reason why schools must be strictly managed now is to abandon this pure environment and train the backbone of society in the future—the youth. Because if students in school do not cultivate their minds and bodies enough, they can easily fall into a bad environment and go with the flow without stopping. Therefore, young students in school should establish a revolutionary outlook on life, cultivate morality and improve themselves, in order to lay the foundation for future behavior in the world. One must first self-govern before he can govern others, and one can only manage affairs after he can govern others. The so-called way of beginning and end in the university lies in this.

The second goal of education is "自養養人" (self-sufficiency and supporting others). If one cannot make a living after being educated, then he is a disabled person; if one has the ability to earn fifty yuan but wants to spend one hundred yuan, then the income and expenses can never be offset, and one will be destroyed, which is a crime against the country. Therefore, after young students leave school, they should strive for hard work and thrift in consumption. Whenever you do something, you must start from the bottom and work your way up. For example, I originally studied mining. After graduating, I worked as a dirty miner. Now, if I am handling mining affairs, if someone is deceiving me about the miners, I can definitely find out, because I have completely gone through the difficult stages of the lower level. Similarly, when we go to the army, we must start from the squad leader and platoon leader, so that we can see the real situation at the lower level. A person who can be better than others lies in his rich experience, broad knowledge, and high morality. Therefore, the general youth should use this precious period of life—from the age of twenty to thirty—as a period of preparation for learning and practice. If a solid foundation can be laid in this period, they can become useful talents in the future. Now, some young people often neglect the exploration of profound knowledge and international economics, and only know how to exclude each other and compete for the height of their position. They only see the present and do not see the distant and bright future, which is really a sign of national subjugation. We must know that the youth of today are the mainstay of nation-building in the future, and in terms of academic experience, they must be slowly cultivated from low to high, like a "pyramid." Although it takes a long time, the effect is really great. In terms of morality, we must try our best to reduce our private life. If you are able to be honest and upright in the agency, and have clean hands, then "合則留，不合則去" (if you agree, stay; if you disagree, leave), and have no desire to stay in office, execute your tasks, judge the rights and wrongs of others, and not be restrained or threatened by others. Therefore, we must try our best to be frugal in school, so that we can avoid the evil path of corruption in the future and complete our great careers. Confucius said: "君子憂道不憂貧" (A gentleman worries about the way, not poverty), and also said: "士志於道，而恥惡衣惡食者，未足與議也" (A scholar who aspires to the way but is ashamed of bad clothes and bad food is not worth discussing with). This is really an attitude that a person should adopt when dealing with the world. Our leader's family eats three vegetarian dishes and one soup for each meal, and sometimes they are even too busy to eat. Look at how frugal and hard-working this is. Duke Zhou, as the royal assistant, still "一沐三握髮，一飯三吐哺" (washed his hair three times in one bath and spit out his food three times in one meal), and even "思兼三王，以施四事，其有不合者，仰而思之，夜以繼日，坐以待旦" (considered the achievements of the three kings and applied them to the four affairs, and if there was anything that did not fit, he would look up and think about it, day and night, sitting and waiting for dawn), working diligently for the country, to such an extent, that he was able to lay the foundation for the eight hundred years of the Zhou Dynasty. Now, the affairs of the public—the political departments—are becoming more and more complicated, and it is not enough to rely on the efforts of our leader alone. We also need the efforts of all skilled workers—the general youth. Therefore, modern youth must not only have the ability to support themselves, but also plan to support others. Premier Sun said: Those who are smarter and more capable often use their abilities to serve thousands of people and create blessings for thousands of people; those who are slightly less intelligent and capable should use their abilities to serve ten to a hundred people and create blessings for ten to a hundred people; as for those who have no intelligence or ability at all, they should also use their own abilities to serve one person and create blessings for one person, which is what he meant.

### The Current Way Out for Youth (Part 1)

— Feng Wenbin's speech, special correspondent from Xi'an

The third goal of education is "自衡衛團" (self-defense and defending the community). In order to shoulder the more difficult task after winning the War of Resistance, we must first have a healthy body and cultivate a spirit that can withstand frost and dew and endure wind and snow. This is not only about strengthening the individual, but also about seeking the health of the nation. Therefore, the general youth must pay attention to general exercises and military training in schools, because the purpose of military training is to cultivate the healthy spirit of the nation. At present, the proportion of young people who are physically qualified is very small on average. Thinking about the mostly weak masses, how can China not be in danger? Therefore, I advocate that physical exercise should have a certain standard, the so-called "格" (standard). In the past, the physical fitness of the general people of our country was very strong, but later, due to the concept of fair-skinned scholars as the beauty of scholars, the nation gradually fell into a state of weakness. We should change the concept of beauty to "those who are physically fit are called beautiful," and promote it to form a trend, so that everyone regards being strong as natural and being weak as shameful. We should universally promote military training and advocate health campaigns. In this way, in addition to strengthening the physical fitness of individuals, we can also improve the health of the entire nation. Everyone can defend themselves, everyone can defend the country, and the nation will be strong, and the country's status will naturally increase.

Finally, the purpose of education itself is "自信信道" (self-confidence and believing in the way). The so-called self-confidence is to enable the educated to have the ambition to complete their own responsibilities and missions; at that time, they should establish a common belief in the country, and based on this belief, work together to promote the construction of the country, which is the so-called belief in the way, or in other words, belief in isms. The Three Principles of the People are still the main line for our nation to seek survival, and can also be said to be the common path we take today, and the responsibility of educators is to understand the Three Principles of the People and seek their implementation. Therefore, the Doctrine of the Mean says: "修道之謂教" (Cultivating the way is called teaching).

The meanings of the above are integrated as follows: 1. Teach—self-confidence and believing in the way, 2. Control—self-governance and managing affairs, 3. Nurture—self-sufficiency and supporting others, 4. Protect—self-defense and defending the country. Only when young people have these four elements can they be standard youth. If a country is composed of such youth, then the country will naturally have the four major conditions of control, teaching, nurturing, and protection. If only half of the four conditions are met, that is, only self-confidence, self-governance, self-sufficiency, and self-defense, but not believing in the way, managing affairs, supporting others, or defending the country, then only the effort of establishing oneself has been completed, which is just passing the exam. It is of no benefit to society. Living is not worthy of respect, and death is not worthy of pity. Congo fundamentally cannot meet any of the conditions. Such youth are better off dead than alive. The standard youth we hope for are everyone with the above sixteen characters, who is a national with a sound personality.

Therefore, I now hope that the general youth can seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to cultivate the ability of "自信信道" (self-confidence and believing in the way), "自治治事" (self-governance and managing affairs), "自養養人" (self-sufficiency and supporting others), and "自銜衛國" (self-defense and defending the country) to complete the sound personality of a revolutionary. The responsibility for building the nation in the future is really on our shoulders!

(1)

Our efforts need to have a certain direction.

The most basic of all directions is the unity of all young people. Only by establishing a strong united front of young people to resist Japan and save the country can we have hope of victory.

A serious problem placed in front of all Chinese youth is the problem of liberation and destruction. If we unite, we can be liberated; if we split, we will be destroyed.

Because at present, it is an emergency moment for the survival of our great nation with a history of four to five thousand years. The × people have penetrated our hearts and occupied almost all of our famous cities and towns and transportation hubs. As long as we relax, the vast land left to us by our ancestors will be completely occupied by the × people, and the long-standing culture left to us will be completely destroyed by the × people, and our descendants will forever be slaves of the × people.

Everyone is under the same threat, and everyone has to choose one of the paths between victory and destruction.

If we are like a dish of loose sand and fight on our own, or even resist Japan while fighting and rubbing against each other, we will inevitably be defeated by the × people one by one. Therefore, unity is necessary. Unity was needed in the past, and unity is needed even more when the war is critical. Everyone needs unity, and young people with strong vitality, who are the lifeline of the country, need unity even more. Unity means life, division means death.

Only if all Chinese young men and women, regardless of class, party, belief, or race, as long as they are unwilling to be subjugated and exterminated, as long as they are willing to live a human life and live a free and happy life, work together closely and unite, can this be the only way out for our youth.

Since the Chinese ××× August 1st Declaration and the Beiping students' December 9th Movement in 1935, united resistance against Japan for national independence, democratic freedom, and people's happiness has become the common demand of the vast majority of young people across the country. Nineteen months ago, the first representative conference of the Northwest Youth National Salvation Association made a concrete proposal for the unity of young people across the country:

"1. Regardless of party, class, belief, or gender, all young people across the country should unite under the goal of resisting Japan and saving the country.

2. Abandon partisan prejudices and mutual attacks. Youth organizations in various parts of the country should cooperate with each other to create unified youth organizations across the country and in various regions.

3. Decisions should be made by the majority under democratic principles, and the leading bodies should be elected by the majority.

4. Representatives should be mutually elected by young people from all over the country to convene a national youth national salvation representative conference to decide on a common program for resisting Japan and saving the country.

5. Fight for all improvements in young people's lives, economy, and politics."

This proposal represents the universal demands of young people across the country. With the outbreak and progress of the old resistance, the understanding of the need for youth to unite has become even more certain throughout the country. Generalissimo Chiang said well in his letter to the youth of the country on June 16, 1938:

"If we want to win the war and build the country, we must cultivate the deep strength of the country and the nation as its foundation, and the so-called deep strength of the country and the nation is the awakening and unity of the youth of the whole country."

(2)

We must unite, and we can unite.

We can unite, first of all because we have common interests. We have a common × enemy, Japanese imperialism, and a common cause, resisting Japan and building the country. They are common to young people of all classes and parties, and they are also common to young people of all regions and ethnic groups.

The aggression of Japanese imperialism has broken our old boundaries.

The students in Beiping had disputes between the old student union and the new student union, and even bloodshed occurred. When the × people came, they not only forced them to receive the slave education of the traitors, but also forced them to participate in the "celebration" parade when Taiyuan fell. At this time, the old and new student unions who stayed in Beiping hid in a room and cried together. The old prejudices no longer existed.

The × people ruined the bronze statue of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in Shanghai and the mausoleum in Nanjing, and also insulted the temples of Buddhism and Lamaism. The × people conspired to use the methods of Prince De to deceive the Hui people to establish the so-called Hui Hui State, but at the same time they used planes to bomb the Hui people and force the young Hui compatriots to eat meat.

Chinese youth of all classes, parties, regions, and ethnic groups have shed their hot blood all over the battlefield of national self-defense. Their blood flows together, merges together, and it is impossible to distinguish which party, region, or race it is. This is the ironclad evidence that Chinese youth can unite. (Applause)

The representatives at our meeting include young people from the Kuomintang, young people from the Communist Party, and young people who are non-partisan. Our representatives include both men and women in terms of gender, and workers, farmers, soldiers, students, and businessmen in terms of social composition. Our representatives come from various provinces in the Northwest and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, as well as from the rear and behind enemy lines in the war zones of Suiyuan, Northwest Shanxi, West Shanxi, Southwest Shanxi, Southeast Shanxi, Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei, Central Hebei, Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Southeast Shandong, Henan, the two Hubei provinces, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, as well as from Korea and various parts of Nanyang. We are all of one mind and purpose, for the unity of the youth, to study the experiences and future of the Chinese youth movement. Everyone has come from thousands of miles away, loving each other like blood brothers and sisters born of the same mother. This is also the ironclad evidence that Chinese youth can unite. (Applause)

And our unity has many favorable conditions.

First, we have the anti-Japanese national united front as our foundation. What is the backbone of the anti-Japanese national united front? It is the Kuomintang of China and the Communist Party of China. The Kuomintang is the party that holds power today. Its leader, Generalissimo Chiang, made it clear in an interview with a special correspondent from the Paris Evening Post in April 1938: "The National Government is willing to join hands with all parties to deal with the common × enemy under the condition that Mr. Sun's principles are not violated." The ××× is the ×××× of the ×××. Everyone knows that it is the earliest and most ×× advocate of the anti-Japanese national united front, and the most ×××× supporter and promoter. ××× pointed out to the people of China the overall plan for the struggle of the anti-Japanese national united front, and made every effort to realize it. Similarly, it also pointed out to the youth of China the overall guiding principle for the struggle of the youth united front, and helped to realize it in all aspects. Without the Kuomintang, without the ×××, there would be no youth in the national united front:

Second, our youth not only have the firm determination to unite to resist Japan, but also have the common demand to realize democracy and improve people's livelihood. Every one of our youth is eager to realize a democratic and free politics. On this point, young people of all parties and all classes can not only obtain the basis for unity, but also obtain the guarantee for unity. The so-called democratic freedom should first guarantee the freedom of thought, belief, speech, publication, assembly, and association. The Three Principles of the People is not only a doctrine of national liberation, but also a doctrine of democratic freedom and the improvement of people's livelihood. It is precisely because of this that the Three Principles of the People is supported by the vast majority of young people and has become an important weapon for youth unity.

Some people think that since we already have the Three Principles of the People, we should no longer allow other thoughts and beliefs to exist at the same time. This is a misunderstanding of the Three Principles of the People, a misinterpretation of them, and a removal of the advantages of the Three Principles of the People. One of the main advantages of the Three Principles of the People is that it adheres to the freedom of thought and belief.

Sun Yat-sen explained the Three Principles of the People by saying: "Nationalism is to fight against injustice abroad, and democracy is to fight against injustice at home... To fight against domestic autocracy, we must apply the Three Principles of the People and promote the rights of the people; to promote the rights of the people is to promote the principle of the public world."

As early as the Kuomintang declaration on January 1, 1931, it clearly "determined that the people have the absolute freedom of assembly, association, speech, publication, residence, and belief." The Outline of Resistance and Nation-Building, which is based on the Three Principles of the People, also stipulates in Article 26: "During the War of Resistance, within the scope of not violating the highest principles of the Three Principles of the People and laws, legal and full protection should be given to speech, publication, assembly, and association." In order to implement this article, the central government has repeatedly emphasized this to the local authorities to show its seriousness.

Can we use the Three Principles of the People to oppose the Principle of Democracy, or use the Outline of Resistance and Nation-Building to oppose Article 26 of the Outline of Resistance and Nation-Building? Obviously not.

Some people also think that although the Three Principles of the People includes the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of People's Livelihood, we cannot advocate them now. We should advocate them after the success of nationalism. (To be continued)

### Brewing of a Major Battle on the Hunan-Hubei Border: Hubei Troops Constantly Moving South to Concentrate; Northern Hunan Tense, Troops Advancing on Three Routes

[Chongqing, 28th Dispatch from the Haitong News Agency] Currently, there have been no changes on the battle lines of Hunan and Hubei provinces. A thousand Japanese soldiers in Yueyang, once attempting to cross the Xinqiang River southward under the cover of airplanes and heavy artillery, were driven back to the north bank after several hours of confrontation between the two armies, suffering heavy casualties with over a hundred bodies left behind. Yesterday, on the west bank of Dongting Lake, a Japanese gunboat and seven motorboats sailed near Huarong and Nanxian counties, opening fire and shelling, then leaving that evening. Currently, an encounter battle has occurred between the two armies on the Wuchang-Changsha highway. According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army is planning a large-scale offensive, as Japanese troops are constantly being reinforced in Yueyang. As for southern Hubei, six thousand Japanese troops attempted to attack Zaoshi and Yuejiakou but consistently failed. Currently, the Japanese army is constantly transferring troops from Yingshan and Kaitianmen to reinforce their forces in that area. In northern Hubei, east of Xiangyang and west of Suixian, there is no trace of the Japanese army, as they have retreated to Zhongxiang and Jingshan. As for Shanxi and Guangdong provinces, they are reportedly in a state of calm.

[Guilin, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] On the morning of the 26th, troops in northern Hunan, divided into three groups, each with infantry and artillery, totaling about five hundred, launched an attack on Ganshi Gengkouxianjiadazhong. The battle at Yanjia Mountain was the fiercest and is still raging.

[Changsha, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] The motorboats operating in Dongting Lake, repeatedly attempting to land on the lake surface of the eastern shore, Lujiaoshi, without success, again sailed to the lake surface of Maizhoupu, east of Huarong on the western shore, at 9:00 AM on the 28th to cause disruption. They were bravely repelled by our forces.

[Miluo, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] The battle situation on the north bank of the Xinqiang River returned to calm on the 28th. Troops on the Zhe River are currently constructing fortifications in the area within eighteen miles of the north bank, forming a confrontational state with our army at Tangjiapai, Yanjia, Daxiaolongwan Bridge, and Gengkou. This time, the enemy attempted to destroy our guerrilla base on the north bank with heavy troops, but after a week of fierce fighting, it has obviously failed.

[Changde, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] According to a telephone call from Shashi, troops trapped in the Dahong Mountains, suffering heavy casualties and lacking ammunition and provisions, withdrew to the vicinity of Anlu on the 25th.

[Fancheng, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] In the recent battle situation in central Hubei, apart from our army controlling troops in the Dahong Mountains and a certain guerrilla unit constantly attacking, the entire front line is calm.

[Chongqing, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] There is currently no change in the situation between Jiangmen and Xinhui. On the 27th, a certain unit of our forces advanced towards the Guanshan Mulang area and engaged in contact with the enemy, and fierce fighting continued until late at night.

[Zhaoqing, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] On the morning of the 27th, over three hundred troops from Sanshui, with several artillery pieces, attacked Lucun from the southwest. Our guerrilla team, together with local villagers, cooperated in resisting, and after three hours of mutual combat, the enemy, unable to withstand, fled in disarray.

[A Certain Place in Northern Jiangsu, 17th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] Enemy troops in Lianghuai repeatedly attacked without success. Later, they raided Shunheji and Gaoliangjian on the west bank of the Grand Canal and were attacked by our army separately. Fierce fighting continued for days, and the enemy still failed and fled. Gaoliangjian has been officially recovered by our forces.

### British General Issues Strong Note to Japan: Refuses to Discuss Shanghai Concession Issue; Vehemently Condemns Illegal Blockade of Our Coastline; US and French Governments Will Also Express the Same Attitude

[London, 27th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] News from well-informed sources here tonight states that the British government is currently preparing to issue a note to Japan to discuss the issue of Chinese public concessions. This is the result of talks between the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, and the person in charge of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the previous two days. London had ordered Craigie to inquire whether the statement made by a Japanese spokesman to reporters the day before regarding the request to manage our country's public concessions was indeed the sincerity of the Japanese government. According to the reply, it was indeed the intention of the Japanese government. The full text of the British note is currently in progress, and it is said that its tone is quite strong. The British government is only willing to discuss the issue of public concessions with the Japanese government before returning the concession territory to the Chinese government in the distant future. However, since all public concessions are currently within the areas occupied by the Japanese army, it is impossible to return them to the Chinese government for the time being. The United Kingdom believes that the entire issue is difficult to discuss further. It is also learned that the US and French governments will also express the same attitude towards the public concession issue, but as of now, the British government has not made this request to Paris or New York. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, the British note to Japan will strongly condemn Japan's declaration of the illegality of blockading the Chinese coast and will point out that the so-called blockade is not within Chinese territorial waters, and since Japan has no rights enjoyed by belligerent countries and has unjustifiably stopped all foreign ships from sailing without a declaration of war, it is not in accordance with reason. In the event of British and American cooperation, it would only cause economic difficulties for Japan and could indirectly cut off its supply of munitions. According to the Sunday Times, Roosevelt can implement neutrality towards Japan, such as a law prohibiting the supply of munitions to belligerent countries if Japan declares war. The report continued that more than 80 percent of Japan's munitions come from the United States.

### China and Communications Banks Establish Small Loans to Relieve Chongqing Disaster Victims; The Two Banks Have Allocated 400,000 Yuan to Provide Interest-Free Loans to Bombed Industrial and Commercial Circles

[Chongqing, 28th Dispatch from the Associated Press] Financial circles here told reporters yesterday that the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are now conducting small loans. Small merchants, small factory owners, and small vendors who have lost all their family property due to the recent bombing by Japanese aircraft can go to borrow money without interest. Those who borrow money to purchase goods have a term of three months, while those who purchase tools and machinery have a limit of six months to one year to repay. The two banks have allocated 400,000 yuan specifically for this loan. The amount borrowed by small vendors shall not exceed 30 yuan per person, while shopkeepers and landlords can borrow 300 yuan to purchase equipment.

Drafting an Ultimatum

[London, 28th Dispatch from the Associated Press] Martin, an advisor to the British Foreign Office, is currently drafting a strong ultimatum refusing to recognize Japan's right to block the coast in China and refuting Japan's claim to control all concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, Xiamen, and Bangkok, Siam. The note will urge Japan to pay attention to Britain's treaty rights and resolutely reject all of Japan's claims.

British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, stated to the British government yesterday that the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs openly declared that it would use force against all countries to protect Japan's "rights." The Japanese government should be responsible for this threatening language.

Because the Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom gave a speech on Thursday satirizing the current attitude of democratic countries as being strong in appearance but weak in reality, and with the British-Soviet alliance about to be completed, the relationship between Britain and the Axis countries has obviously cooled.

British Press Commentary

[London, 18th Dispatch from Reuters] The diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Times declared today that the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, Nobel, had previously protested to the Japanese authorities about the Gulangyu incident. If a satisfactory reply is not received, a strong response will be given to the Japanese naval blockade of Gulangyu in the next few days. The Gulangyu incident is the most important test action. Japan is in fact illegally demanding the rights of belligerent countries without recognizing the state of war. If the state of war does not actually exist, then Japan has no legal basis to demand the rights of belligerent countries. If Japan's interference in British interests in public concessions becomes more serious, Britain's most obvious retaliatory weapon is to punish trade with Japan. This weapon is most feared by Japan because without British, French, and American trade, Japan will not be able to continue the war.

[London, 27th Dispatch from Reuters] The Times here commented this morning on the recent tension between Japan and countries such as Britain and France due to the Chinese coast incident (referring to difficulties with British and French ships). Japan's high-pressure tactics outside Hong Kong and the Gulangyu incident are directly related. The Japanese naval authorities launched an illegal raid on Gulangyu, and not getting their wish, they were angered and took this action. Some people expect that Japan may take new actions before the incident is resolved. Japan's oppression of foreigners in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places and its failure to abide by its past promises to respect foreign rights have caused significant inconvenience to foreigners. However, Japan may soon reconsider its policies towards countries related to China. It is not impossible. Facts have proven that it is inappropriate for Japan to destroy China, and it is also wrong to use cunning tricks to exclude the interests of countries such as Britain and the United States.

### Guangdong Provincial Assembly: Closed Yesterday

[Lian County, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] The Guangdong Provisional Provincial Assembly opened on the 15th, with 37 assembly members present. A total of 78 proposals were submitted and discussed in ten meetings. On the 27th, after the discussion was completed, Zhu Nianci, Liang Naixian, and nine others were elected as resident assembly members and issued a declaration, sending a telegram to comfort compatriots overseas on the battlefield.

### Severe Drought in Shanxi and Shaanxi: Sudden Abundance of Rain

[Xingji, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] Since the beginning of this year, Shanxi and Shaanxi have suffered from severe drought for several months. On the 27th, there was a sudden downpour, allowing for the complete harvest of wheat fields and the planting of autumn seedlings.

### Bloody Battle Northeast of Wuchuan: 3,000 Troops from Enemy and Puppet Forces Surrounded Us on Multiple Routes; After Blocking by Our Main Forces, Many Enemy Troops Were Annihilated

[Hequ, 27th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] About 3,000 troops from the enemy and puppet forces, with 10 artillery pieces and 40 vehicles, recently attempted to encircle us on four routes. On the 19th, our main force engaged in a bloody battle with them in the area northeast of Wuchuan, which was extremely fierce. One unit of our forces engaged in several hand-to-hand combats with the enemy in the Wai Dong area to seize strongholds, killing more than 50 enemy soldiers and finally defeating them. Another unit of our forces engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy's third route at Changshun Shui Xing for about an hour, killing about 200 enemy soldiers. They are still fighting northeast of Wuchuan.

[Xinghua, 26th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] More than 100 enemy soldiers in Funing attacked Sanjie沟 on the morning of the 25th, and were intercepted and attacked on both sides by the Republic Army, killing more than 40 enemy soldiers. The enemy, unable to withstand, retreated. Subsequently, more than 200 soldiers were transferred to commit disturbances. Two enemy ships sailed to Sheyanghe and landed more than 100 naval soldiers at Wufang Port. They encountered our militia at the same time, and the artillery fire was fierce. After six hours of fierce fighting, our militia withdrew safely.

[Xingji, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] On the night of the 24th, our army advanced to the Pingyuan Shiwan area of Zhaocheng, destroyed several sections of the railway, and then ambushed in separate groups. Soon, a train from the enemy heading south arrived at the damaged section of Shiwan, and the enemy soldiers got off the train to repair the road. Our ambushing soldiers fired simultaneously, and after an hour of fierce fighting, more than 20 enemy soldiers were killed. The rest, unable to withstand, boarded the train in panic and fled north.

[Xingji, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] More than 400 enemy soldiers entrenched in Jingxiang Town, west of Fenxi, attacked Kecheng Town (southwest of Jingxiang) via Quantou on the 24th. Our army ambushed and attacked near Pangjialing, and one unit flanked from the high ground in the northeast. After four hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was defeated and fled back to Jingxiang Town, leaving more than 50 bodies behind.

### Spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission States: The Arrest of Chen Yi is Absolutely Not True

[Chongqing, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] Regarding the absurd statement released by the enemy's Tongmeng News Agency on the 26th that a copy of Chen Yi had been arrested by the Central Army, the reporter specifically inquired about the truth from the Military Affairs Commission. The spokesperson of the Commission solemnly clarified that there was no such thing. Then, Chen Chairman's telegram on the 27th was shown to show that the enemy was spreading rumors, which is a habitual trick. Chairman Chen is loyal and patriotic and has contributed greatly to national defense. The enemy has repeatedly tried to create disturbances but has not succeeded, so they made this rumor in an attempt to slander him. The fact is the same as the Tokyo broadcast on the 16th of this month that the chief of staff of our 31st Division was captured near Xinheji. They are both unfounded because our 31st Division did not participate in this battle at all. How could the enemy capture its chief of staff? The reason for this mystery is to cover up the fact that the chief of staff of the rest of the Jiangxi divisions was captured by us.

### Returning from Inspecting the Guerrilla Areas in Southern Jiangsu: Zhou Enlai Talks About the New Situation (Part 2); Organizing the Masses Behind Enemy Lines to Launch a People's War; Transforming the Rear into the Front to Defeat Economic Conspiracies

Economic Aggression. According to Zhou, the Japanese side's plan to clear the rear has five points: (1) To impose an economic blockade on us; (2) To conduct economic warfare against us; (3) To plunder our coal, iron, cotton, salt, tea, rice, and other products in order to enrich Japan's resources and turn these raw materials into Japanese goods for dumping in China; (4) To develop the transportation lines in North China; (5) To build ports. At the beginning of the war, Japan originally intended to blockade our country, but as of today, it wants to engage in trade with us. At the beginning of the war, it originally intended to destroy all of our industries, but as of today, it is trying to rebuild industries in our occupied areas. It is also quite unfavorable for Japan's international payments to encourage exports in one direction. As for Japan's plan to obtain raw materials in the occupied areas, it has been very unsuccessful. For example, the Japanese attempted to obtain 10 million tons of coal in North China, but only managed to collect 1 million tons. Furthermore, the problem of economic development is fundamentally impossible because this point must be controlled militarily behind the Japanese army. Therefore, initially, it took 1.4 yuan of legal tender to exchange for 1 yuan of puppet currency, but as of now, this exchange rate has been reversed. As for their plan to build harbors, it was planned long ago, but has not yet started.

Our Countermeasures. Zhou continued to talk about the outlines of our response to the Japanese side's plan, saying, "We recognize that there are many weaknesses, such as not being able to completely economically blockade Japan, not being able to fiercely resist Japanese goods, and not being able to completely destroy various factories before falling into enemy hands. At the same time, Japanese goods can still flow into our country." Zhou continued, "We must completely blockade the coastal areas, even if the people there feel inconvenienced. Our purpose is to make the Chinese people self-sufficient, so we must continue to carry out destruction work in the occupied areas, especially on railways, highways, and various industries used by the Japanese.

People's War. We have organized the majority of the masses to destroy Japanese transportation lines and preserve Chinese resources in the Japanese rear. At the same time, we will make the people in remote areas understand the meaning of this war of resistance against Japan. The reason why the Japanese army has been able to achieve some success in China is mostly due to our own weaknesses, not entirely due to the strength of the Japanese army. For example, we have some troops that are not familiar with guerrilla tactics, so they have not been able to fully fulfill the mission of attacking the Japanese. At the same time, the cooperation of the masses has not been fully satisfactory, so many places have fallen, which is said to be due to the Japanese conquest, but I would rather say it is due to our voluntary abandonment. As of now, the masses have mostly been organized, and they are all enthusiastic about breaking the Japanese plan to use our country's manpower and porcelain resources to conquer China. Therefore, the war of resistance behind the Japanese army is a full-scale war of organized masses against the Japanese, not just the guerrilla warfare of the guerrillas. At the same time, on the front, when the enemy is moving toward a certain side, we will also launch counterattacks on many sides. Furthermore, we will continue to train new troops in the rear to prepare for the final blow to achieve the final victory.

On the New Stage. Zhou also said, "In this new stage of the war of resistance, the Japanese army can still achieve small victories, but there is no possibility of achieving great victories. It is difficult to predict where the Japanese will attack next, but what is known is that they must attack where they can obtain the greatest final benefit, that is, attacking our weaknesses and unpreparedness. For example, the recent battle of Nanchang is an example. In addition, our railways and other transportation lines are also among their attack objectives. Roughly, the direction of this Japanese attack will depend on the changes in the European situation. If Britain and France have problems in Europe, the Japanese will continue to advance southwest; otherwise, they will advance north. In short, their purpose is to eliminate foreign interests in China."

### Gambling Dens and Opium Dens in Western Shanghai: Expanding to the Concessions; One on Yu Yuan Road Has Political Implications; All Under the Protection of the Enemy

[Shanghai Correspondent] In the "badlands" of the Extra-Settlement Roads area, gambling dens under the protection of the Japanese have begun to expand into the Public Concession in recent weeks. There are three newly established gambling dens, two on Haig Road and one at No. 65 Gordon Road, the Asia Club. The gambling den near No. 368 Haig Road is operated by Chinese who run "Hollywood Paradise." Another one at the corner of Haig Road and Route Tenant de la Tour is of an independent nature. In addition, there are about 20 gambling dens in Route des Soeurs, Connaught Road, Brenan Road, Rue Ferguson, and in a village in the Extra-Settlement Roads area. The new gambling den on Gordon Road, entirely within the Public Concession, is said to be the most profitable, earning as much as 40,000 gold in one night. These gambling dens are all operated by Chinese who have close ties with the Japanese Military Special Services Department and receive its protection. The Gordon Road and Haig Road gambling dens are financed by a Cantonese man named Wang, a shareholder of Hollywood Paradise. The gambling den at the corner of Haig Road and Route Tenant de la Tour is established by a man named Li and managed by a man named Liu, who is said to be a Taiwanese. The Japanese Military Special Services Department, which guarantees the protection of these gambling dens, has an office near the corner of Route des Soeurs and Route Kaufmann, headed by a Japanese man named Jieye. There is one Japanese man in charge of accounting in the Gordon Road gambling den, and half of the profits must be handed over to the Japanese side. It is unknown whether other gambling dens pay protection fees to the Japanese Military Special Services Department. The Japanese not only guarantee that the Chinese operating the gambling dens will not be interfered with by the police of the Public Concession, but also guarantee that gamblers will not be arrested or interfered with when returning home after curfew. Since the Japanese army occupied the Shanghai area, the evils that came with it are not limited to gambling dens. A newspaper supplement has published the names of 34 opium dens, all located outside the jurisdiction of the Public Concession and the French Concession. It is said that these opium dens all have licenses issued by the Japanese Military Special Services Department and pay a monthly fee of 600 yuan. In the past week, four more opium dens have been opened. The development of these evils in the Extra-Settlement Roads area and their spread into the Public Concession will naturally have a negative impact on the Concession.

[Another Dispatch] Recently, many new gambling dens have been established in the Extra-Settlement Roads area of western Shanghai, harming the people more than floods or fierce beasts. The house at No. 864 Yu Yuan Road has been brewing the organization of a large-scale gambling den for a long time. Because it has not obtained the understanding of a certain party, preparations were once temporarily suspended. Recently, a certain party member came forward to preside over it and announced its realization. The participants in the organization are extremely complex, and its content is political in nature. However, its gambling part harms society, just like other gambling dens. The Concession authorities are now observing its development in order to take appropriate measures and severely crack down on it.

### × Armies Forcefully Occupy, Eastern Sui Situation Deteriorates, Commerce and Finance Completely Controlled by × Forces, × Propaganda Purely Castles in the Air, Report of Inspection by Shanghai News Reporter

[Shanghai Correspondence] According to a Zhangjiakou dispatch in the North-China Daily News, in February, a group of foreign reporters, under the guidance of Japanese officials, toured Guihua in Suiyuan. According to news collected from various newspapers, after these reporters returned, they enthusiastically wrote about their pleasant experiences traveling in Inner Mongolia, almost portraying it as a second paradise. They claimed the area was peaceful and vast, trade was prosperous, local industry was developed, and the people were extremely happy and content. The reporter is well aware that the situation there is similar to Zhangjiakou, and these optimistic reports greatly surprised the reporter. Therefore, not long ago, driven by curiosity, the reporter went to Guihua and other towns for a few weeks and returned greatly disappointed, unable to understand the basis for such optimistic reports. Based on the reporter's observations:

The situation in Inner Mongolia is not only not optimistic, but actually worse than before the Japanese invasion. The prosperous export trade that Guihua once relied on has now completely ceased. The reason for this is twofold. First, the caravan route that started from Ganzhou and extended to southwestern Xinjiang has been completely cut off. The Chinese army's front line is only a few miles west of Baotou, the final station of the Ping-Sui Railway. In the past, long lines of camels slowly traveled along this ancient caravan route, at a pace of two and a half miles per hour, carrying leather, wool, and other products from western Suiyuan. Not to mention the highly profitable opium caravans, all of this has stopped. Now, no caravans arrive in Baotou or Guihua. Second, in the northern Mongolian plains,

Bandits run rampant as before. Therefore, Chinese merchants who used to frequently go to Mongolia to collect and purchase products no longer risk venturing into these areas. In reality, the areas inhabited by the people have been devastated. Many villages are deserted, and the people are suffering terribly from poverty. Much of the cultivated land has now reverted to pasture. In other respects, the Mongolians themselves no longer bring their goods to the railway towns for sale, fearing that they will be forced to sell them at the officially set low prices. The only remaining export trade must go through the Mengzang Company. This company is nominally a joint venture of six Mongolian firms, but in reality, it is entirely under

Japanese control, completely and absolutely monopolizing all export products. Outsiders, unless they obtain special permission, are not allowed to buy or sell wool, leather, or any other common export items. When the reporter was in Guihua, several German merchants also arrived there. Although they obtained special permission from the Japanese, they encountered great difficulties in managing to purchase even the smallest amount of what they needed, and they left with great dissatisfaction. In short, the authorities have made it clear that they do not welcome the participation of outsiders, and they use various means to prevent outsiders from entering. To stay in Inner Mongolia for a slightly longer period, one must obtain a special permit issued by the Japanese military authorities, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain such permits. Soon after the establishment of the "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government," the new Mengzang banknotes were put into circulation, but no one trusts them. Although foreign exchange is strictly restricted and all imports and exports are controlled, the exchange rate between Mengzang currency and legal tender is very unfavorable. As a result, prices of all goods have doubled in the past year and a half, but this has not compensated for the increased cost of living. The local retail trade is still as good as before, but most customers, apart from those who sell daily necessities, are Japanese soldiers and civilians. In the past, wealthy Mongolian men and women would flock to Guihua every year to shop, crowding the streets, but this is no longer seen. The so-called "foreign goods stores" that they especially liked to patronize have now become "luxury goods" display centers with little business. Opium is heavily planted in the surrounding countryside. It is said that opium is planted in more than one-tenth of the fields. This is probably because the supply of opium, which was usually transported by caravans, has been cut off.

The political situation does not seem to be more pleasant than the commercial and financial situation. Mongolians and Japanese are quite distrustful of each other. Although the Mongolian government is nominally autonomous, it is actually controlled by Japanese advisors. Recently, it has even been manipulated by representatives of the Japanese army. Mongolian princes know very well that they are in a subordinate position and are very indecisive, but they are powerless to do anything about it. The several thousand Mongolian soldiers recruited to fight against the Chinese army and suppress bandits, the so-called "Inner Mongolia Army," are extremely bad. They have no discipline, let alone combat capability. The Japanese themselves do not trust them. These Mongolian soldiers are often sent out to suppress bandits, but they loot villages and commit the most terrible atrocities. Therefore, the people hate them to the bone, even more than the Japanese army. Because of the uselessness of the Mongolian army, Chinese regular troops often attack the cities of Suiyuan, directly approaching the city walls without any losses. Occasionally, when the Chinese army waits for the × forces to approach, the Mongolian army, seeing the situation as serious, flees elsewhere. Because both the Japanese and the Mongolians are dissatisfied, when the reporter was in Guihua, both sides were quite tense. Rumors abounded throughout the city, some saying that the "Mongolian Military Government" was about to move elsewhere, and that the nominal head, Prince De, had already been dismissed; others saying that the "Autonomous Government" would be completely abolished and the area would be directly ruled by the Japanese army. Whether these rumors will become reality remains to be seen in the future, but some changes may be unavoidable soon. In terms of the welfare of the common people of Inner Mongolia, the current regime has certainly not improved the areas it governs. In fact, as mentioned in the first paragraph of this article, the situation there is worse than in early 1937,

Significantly deteriorated. In short, there are three reasons for this: (1) Poor handling of general financial and economic affairs. (2) The deep hatred of the Chinese, who account for nine-tenths of the population, towards the Japanese occupation is as strong as ever. (3) The Japanese have failed to win the friendship and cooperation of the Mongolians.

### Soviet-French Proposal Draft, Soviet Union to Reply Soon, Observers Believe It is Acceptable, Agreement Principle is to Promote Mutual Assistance

[Reuters Moscow, 27th] British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, visited the Soviet Foreign Ministry today and had a secret conversation with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov for over an hour, and presented the British and French proposals for a tripartite mutual assistance pact. The Soviet government is now studying the British and French proposals and will reply soon. It is widely believed that if agreed upon, the pact will be signed in Moscow.

[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 28th] At 4 PM yesterday, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, visited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and presented the British memorandum on the issue of the Anglo-Soviet agreement.

[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 28th] Yesterday afternoon, the French chargé d'affaires also accompanied the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union during his visit to the Soviet Foreign Minister and presented a memorandum. It is said that the contents of the document are largely the same as the British memorandum. Subsequently, the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union held a one-hour discussion with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin. As to the outcome, all four remained silent, so it is unknown. As of now, Molotov's personal views on these two documents and whether the Soviet government will accept the British and French proposals are still unknown. According to diplomatic circles, Molotov has made no comments because he must first consult Stalin before replying.

[Associated Press, Paris, 28th] The French government approved yesterday the French Foreign Minister's negotiations on the tripartite agreement and the full text of the memorandum submitted to the Soviet Union.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 27th] The draft of the British, French, and Soviet tripartite mutual assistance agreement jointly proposed by the British and French governments has been commented on by various observers, who all believe that it is in line with the original proposal and is acceptable. The key points of the British and French draft are twofold: (1) If any signatory is attacked, the other signatories will automatically provide assistance. This is a further step compared to the current Franco-Soviet agreement, which requires the League of Nations Council to determine that an aggression has indeed occurred before mutual assistance is implemented. The mutual assistance agreement drafted by the UK, France, and the Soviet Union focuses on promoting the principle of mutual assistance in order to contribute to the general peace situation and is consistent with the basic principles of the League of Nations Covenant. This shows that the League of Nations has not been abandoned. (2) Which countries will need the assistance of the UK, France, and the Soviet Union in the future? The British and French draft does not specify. According to this, Poland and Romania are included in the guaranteed countries, as are the Baltic coastal countries: Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. British and French sources here say that all these points should satisfy the Soviet Union, but details may still need to be discussed. In short, the formation of an alliance between the Soviet Union and the old capitalist countries is a refreshing sight for the world. However, it is not appropriate to make any definite predictions before the outcome of the negotiations is determined.

[Central News Agency, London, 28th] Britain may send a military mission to Moscow to hold talks with Soviet General Staff officers. France will also take similar action so that the three countries can conduct a thorough study of anti-aggression defense issues. According to unconfirmed reports from German sources here, once the peace front is established, Britain will diplomatically offer Hitler an opportunity to negotiate with various countries in order to resolve Germany's own difficulties. There are even widespread rumors that Britain is considering convening a European peace conference.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 27th] Well-informed sources here recently stated that after the UK, France, and the Soviet Union establish a mutual assistance agreement, Germany and Italy may draw Japan into signing a military alliance and invite Spain and Hungary to join as a retaliatory measure. If this move materializes, it will have two effects: (1) After the German-Italian alliance is expanded, some small European countries located between the democracies and the totalitarian states will have to make a choice. (2) After the strength of the two major blocs is clearly visible, the UK, France, Germany, and Italy may hold a meeting to find ways to resolve various important pending issues. In addition, the current tense situation may gradually tire the UK and France, leading them to accept the demands of the totalitarian states.

### British House of Commons Discusses, German Annexation of Czech Issue, All Parties Advocate Non-Recognition

[London, 27th Radio] Yesterday, before adjourning for the "Christmas Advent" recess, the House of Commons discussed two important issues: one was the possibility of the British government recognizing Germany's occupation of the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia. Labor MP Alexander initiated the debate that day, stating, "Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement did not explicitly guarantee that he would not recognize the annexation of Bohemia and Moravia before consulting with Parliament. The opposition party is extremely concerned about this point. I will ask the government to clearly announce that it will not take such action in the future. I recall that on March 22, the British Foreign Secretary stated that the British government had protested against Germany's military actions and the changes they caused, saying that they had no legal basis. On March 17, the Prime Minister also expressed his anger in a speech in Birmingham. The opposition party strongly supports the Prime Minister's position, so it believes that the government should not consider the issue of recognition." Liberal MP Sir Sinclair mentioned the issue of the protection of Eastern European countries, stating, "If this policy is to succeed, it requires extraordinary national effort. What is most noteworthy is that the French government has refused to appoint a consul to Slovakia, while the British government has decided to send a consul to Bratislava. The French government has not yet expressed its agreement. Although I acknowledge that Slovakia has an independent government, that government is in fact a puppet organization controlled by Germany, so I also oppose sending a consul. The situation in establishing a consulate in Prague is different because we must apply for a "consular certificate" from Berlin. What I hope is that no matter what method the government takes to protect our interests in Prague, we must not have the slightest suspicion of recognizing Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic." Conservative MP Bossom also stated, "Recognizing Germany's annexation of the Czech Republic is an unthinkable thing." Conservative MP Brasswaite, while agreeing to postpone the period of recognition, still felt that permanent postponement was also difficult unless the countries could use force to restore the situation before the annexation.

### Yankee Clipper Completes First Official Flight

[Port Washington, 27th] The "Yankee Clipper" has now completed its first official voyage, carrying mail and crossing the Atlantic, arriving here today. The aircraft took off from Southampton on Wednesday.

[Reuters, New York, 28th] 27-year-old aviator Thomas Smith departed from Waters, Maine at 3:47 PM today to fly across the Atlantic.

### Chamberlain Fishes, Hitler Vacations

[Reuters, London, 27th] Today is the first day of the Christmas holiday. The weather here is clear, and citizens are traveling by car. Prime Minister Chamberlain returned here from Edinburgh last night and left here again today for fishing in southern England, taking a short trip of a few days. Queen Mary's injuries continue to improve.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 28th] Hitler has gone to Berchtesgaden for his holiday.

### British Navy Prepares to Safeguard Far East Interests, Australian Fleet Cooperates with Britain, Netherlands to Strengthen East Indies Strength

[Reuters, Ottawa, 27th] Australian Federal Defense Minister Street told the press today that the British Admiralty has drawn up a complete plan. When necessary, the Singapore naval base will station a full fleet, including battleships, to protect British interests in the Far East. The Australian government has guaranteed that Australia's defense strength, including the navy, will fully cooperate with the British fleet stationed in Singapore and the fleet stationed in China.

[Central News Agency, The Hague, 28th] The Dutch government will submit a shipbuilding bill to Congress, stipulating the construction of at least three battlecruisers of 25,000 to 30,000 tons. Since the naval strength of various countries in the Pacific has been enhanced, the Netherlands also wants to increase the strength of its East Indies fleet.

[Reuters, The Hague, 27th] The Dutch Minister of Defense today ordered that the Dutch armed forces must be in a state of readiness to cope with any emergencies.

### British Aircraft Production Plan Successful, Nearly a Thousand Aircraft Manufactured Monthly, Large Aircraft Factory to be Established in Scotland

[Reuters, London, 28th] The Sunday Times reported that the production plan of the Aviation Department has been extremely successful, and the current production rate has reached what was expected at the end of last year. According to some responsible sources, the number of aircraft manufactured in Britain each month is close to one thousand. The newspaper also stated that it is not excessive or unattainable for Britain to estimate that it can manufacture 35,000 to 40,000 aircraft per year in wartime, because the Aviation Department can expand the aircraft manufacturing industry three or four times larger in wartime than in peacetime. Another good phenomenon is that the quality of Britain's new aircraft is extremely good. For example, the Hawker Hurricane is 20 miles per hour faster than the fastest German fighter, and the Spitfire, which is currently being produced in large quantities, is 35 miles per hour faster than the Hawker Hurricane.

[Reuters, London, 27th] It is reported that the world's largest aircraft engine manufacturing plant will be established in Scotland. The plant is planned to be built in Glasgow. It will start work after Rolls-Royce's 4 million pound new plan is completed. The plant is scheduled to start construction next year and can employ about 3,000 workers. When fully increased in working efficiency, it will be able to accommodate 10,000 workers. A temporary factory has now been set up to start training workers.

[Reuters, London, 27th] British Minister of Civil Defense Anderson stated in a speech in Glasgow today that more than one million civil defense personnel have been recruited, reaching the expected number. The enthusiasm of the public to enlist is no less than that in the months after the start of the last World War, but the allocation of personnel is still not appropriate. There are still some shortcomings to be remedied. He also stated that there are now a large number of sandbags and 50 million gas masks.

### Italian Volunteers in Spain to Withdraw by End of Month, Spain to Demobilize Another 50,000 Soldiers, France on Alert on Moroccan Border

[Reuters, Rome, 27th] According to the Italian newspaper, the date for Italian volunteers in Spain to leave Spain and return to Italy has now been postponed to May 31. Except for some aircraft that will be brought back to Italy in early June, all other military equipment will not be brought back. A farewell ceremony will be held when the Italian air force leaves Spain, and some Spanish officers will participate.

[Central News Agency, Burgos, 28th] Spanish Nationalist leader Franco has ordered the demobilization of another 50,000 soldiers at the end of this month. Including this batch, a total of 250,000 soldiers have been disbanded after the end of the Spanish Civil War.

[Reuters, Paris, 27th] The French Moroccan authorities have recently ordered a ban on aircraft flying and the use of cameras in a large area along the Spanish-Moroccan border.

### German Reserves Regularly Trained, Forced to Join Nazi Organizations, Italy to Set Up General Staff in Turin

[Reuters, Berlin, 27th] The German government has now officially announced an important decree that will enable German reserve personnel to receive regular training. According to the details of the decree, the German government will force all conscripts to join an organization similar to the Nazi stormtroopers so that they can stay in training. In addition to being forced to be conscripted, each person must undergo at least ten time units of training in each training period. At the same time as this announcement, what is sufficient to increase the practical significance of this matter is that the Nazi stormtroopers' battalions will be incorporated into the German armed forces. According to the instructions issued by Stormtroopers leader Viktor Lutze, special stormtroopers defense teams are about to be organized and will receive the same training as regular troops. Those who have completed their reserve service will be transferred to these teams. Therefore, this kind of political organization that has changed from combat operations to a political-military organization, with hundreds of thousands of people, is truly a huge increase in Germany's military strength.

[Haitong News Agency, Milan, 27th] After inspecting the Italian Western fortresses, Mussolini has ordered the establishment of a special general staff for border defense in Turin, and commissioned Lieutenant General Micchi to preside over it. Lieutenant General Micchi served in the European War and the Abyssinian War.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 28th] After discussing the cooperation between the German and Italian air forces with the Italian air force commanders, the German Deputy Minister of Aviation left here yesterday to return to his country.

### British Philanthropist Donates 1.5 Million Pounds to Improve Military Recreation

[Reuters, London, 27th] The famous British philanthropist Lord Nuffield has entrusted his trustees with a large sum of 1.5 million pounds specifically for improving the sports and recreation of the British security forces, local army, and other troops. Nuffield has written to the Secretary of State for War, Hore-Belisha, to notify him of this move, and the Secretary of State for War has replied, expressing his gratitude on behalf of the troops.

### US Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees to Hold Meetings Separately to Discuss Amending Neutrality Act

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] Regarding the issue of amending the Neutrality Act, Secretary of State Hull's proposal has been commented on by various observers, saying that Senator Gillette, a Democrat from Iowa, and Senator Pittman, a Democrat from Nevada (Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee), had previously proposed amendments to the Neutrality Act. The former advocated authorizing the President to declare the existence of a state of war and recognize the belligerents, demarcate dangerous areas, and prohibit American citizens from entering them, otherwise they would bear all risks. The latter advocated that the "cash and carry" provision should apply uniformly to munitions and all other goods. Some points of these two proposals are approved by the government. What Secretary of State Hull has proposed now is a compromise plan. The Senate and House Foreign Affairs Committees will therefore hold separate meetings within days to discuss it.

### Schacht's Speech Sharply Criticized by Indian Newspapers

The Indian people are indeed seeking freedom, but they do not want the freedom obtained from British imperialism to be transferred to the oppression of National Socialist dictatorship.

### Speech by French Foreign Minister Bonnet: England and France Have Become One; Efforts to Establish a Peace Front; Soviet Union Denies Military Agreement with Turkey

[Central News Agency, Paris, 28th] Foreign Minister Bonnet, in a speech delivered at the State Council yesterday, stated that England and France have now become one. In addition to implementing conscription, England has also offered guarantees to several countries. France recognizes that peace is the most precious of all blessings, and peaceful consultation between nations is most necessary. However, if any nation attempts to impose its will upon France, the French people will undoubtedly respond to the nation's call and make the greatest sacrifices, as they did in 1914. It is reported that at yesterday's State Council meeting, the Foreign Minister presented a review of the international situation, stating that the current situation is better than before. However, the French government cannot relax its efforts to establish a democratic peace front. The Foreign Minister also mentioned that England, France, and the Soviet Union may soon announce the establishment of an agreement, and that the Anglo-Turkish agreement may also be signed soon.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 28th] Regarding rumors that a Soviet-Turkish military agreement has indeed been signed a week ago, TASS, based on reliable information, officially declares that this news is completely untrue. No military agreement has been signed between Turkey and the Soviet Union, nor does such an agreement exist at present.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 27th] Rumors that the Soviet government invited Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck to Moscow to discuss the Soviet Union supplying Poland with military equipment and the construction of railways between the two countries have been denied by responsible officials here. Political figures stated that Poland is willing to maintain friendly relations with all its neighbors, and therefore, relations between Poland and the Soviet Union have indeed made smooth progress recently.

Polish Cabinet to Request Full Powers for the President from Parliament

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 28th] The Polish cabinet will submit a bill to parliament granting the government full powers. The bill stipulates that the president can declare a state of war without obtaining the parliament's permission. At the same time, the commander-in-chief of the national army has complete and independent authority over all operational actions. If the bill is passed, the Polish government will become a military dictatorship in the event of war. The bill states that Poland, in view of the current situation, must prepare for war spiritually, materially, and legally. Once war breaks out, all civilian government agencies will be under the jurisdiction of the military authorities, and all civil rights will be suspended.

### The Fate of the World and the Future of the Far East

— Shu Di

Now, let us discuss the concrete progress of the cooperation and negotiations between England and the Soviet Union over the past two months. Generally, it can be divided into three stages. After the fall of Czechoslovakia, the British and French authorities immediately began to contact the Soviet Union, expressing their willingness to jointly resist further aggression. The Soviet Union's response, however, was the somewhat vague idea of rebuilding "collective security." This was the first step. Frankly speaking, the Soviet Union at that time doubted the sincerity of England and France. Then, Romania and Poland were threatened. To show sincerity, England first guaranteed the independence of Poland and Romania. When England and France turned to the Soviet Union again to seek cooperation in Europe, the Soviet Union then put forward further specific suggestions, namely, that this cooperation should include the Far East. This was the second stage. At this time, President Roosevelt intervened, and the US Navy was redeployed to the Pacific. The illusion that England could separate Japan from the aggressive bloc was revived. The British ambassador to Japan became unusually active, and negotiations with the Soviet Union temporarily came to a standstill. However, soon after, Hitler's speech revoked the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, and the situation in Europe became tense again. The negotiations between England and the Soviet Union entered the third stage. This time, England's focus was no longer on cooperation, but simply on asking: (1) If England and France were to be drawn into war to fulfill their guarantees to Romania and Poland, would the Soviet Union help? (2) Could the Soviet Union provide the same guarantees to Romania and Poland? The Soviet Union's answer was: (1) There should be a more definite mutual assistance agreement between the Soviet Union, England, France, and Poland. (2) The scope of the guarantee should extend from the northernmost countries of Eastern Europe all the way to the Balkans, and should also include Western countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

Brief Commentary

### Relief for Out-of-School Refugee Children

The Guangdong Provincial Relief Association has established Chinese Line schools in Hong Kong and Macau to provide relief to out-of-school refugee children. Enrollment registration has been taking place in various districts since the 22nd of this month. As of the 27th, the number of applicants has reached 3,000, exceeding the association's planned quota by as much as two-thirds. This shows that the problem of providing relief to refugee children will remain serious in the future. This is something that people who care about society and public welfare cannot ignore. We hope that leaders from all walks of life will at least strive to achieve the following:

First, a larger-scale enrollment registration should be held so that all out-of-school refugee children in Hong Kong and Macau can register and be properly documented. Second, the registration of unemployed teachers can be expanded simultaneously, and methods for providing relief, organizing, and training these teachers should be discussed promptly. Third, at the same time, promote publicity for the relief of out-of-school children, and launch a unified and widespread fundraising campaign.

To achieve the above steps, on the one hand, guidance and assistance should be obtained from the relevant authorities in the motherland, and on the other hand, the sympathy and assistance of influential figures in Hong Kong and Macau should be sought. In addition, relief for out-of-school refugee children cannot be satisfied merely by providing them with educational opportunities. We must also be concerned about the actual living conditions of the refugee children, and whether the educational organization and training they receive are adapted to the needs of national reconstruction. To increase the efficiency of national reconstruction education and quickly eliminate illiteracy, we should also consider using the new educational tool of the Latinized New Script, and should also vigorously promote the "little teacher" system and realize life education. We must enable these refugee children to work and study hard under the threat of artillery fire, so that they can become a vital force to support national salvation and carry out national reconstruction work in the future.

### Observatory Hoists Typhoon Signal No. 7; Typhoon Approaches Hong Kong from the Northeast; Flights and Ships Suspended, Vessels Seek Shelter; Fire Department and Police Department Prepare for Accidents; Latest Report: Typhoon May Not Hit Hong Kong

The weather in Hong Kong has been unusually fluctuating recently. Experienced boatmen familiar with astronomy have already predicted that this is a sign of a typhoon approaching Hong Kong. As expected, the Hong Kong Observatory received a telegram from Little Luzon yesterday morning stating that a typhoon has been discovered in the South China Sea and appears to be heading towards Hong Kong. Therefore, Typhoon Signal No. 1 was hoisted at 10:15 AM yesterday morning to give a warning. At that time, the typhoon was located between 124 degrees East longitude and 19 degrees North latitude (approximately south of Taiwan and east of the Dongsha Islands), with unpredictable wind direction.

Typhoon Set to Approach Hong Kong from the Northeast; Yesterday afternoon, the Observatory received another telegram from Little Luzon stating that the typhoon has now reached 20 degrees North latitude and 114 degrees East longitude, within a radius of 30 miles (approximately southeast of Hong Kong), heading northeast and north. Therefore, Typhoon Signal No. 7 was changed to be hoisted at 4:30 PM, indicating that the typhoon will approach Hong Kong from the northeast.

Vessels at Sea Seek Shelter; After changing to Typhoon Signal No. 7, the typhoon has entered within a 100-mile radius of Hong Kong. Therefore, the sea suddenly became turbulent. All sizes of cargo boats ended their work one after another, hiring small launches to tow them into typhoon shelters. Coastal vessels and residents along the seaside also made various preparations. At dusk, "wind lamps" shone green and white all around, with roaring waves and sparse mast lights, creating a bleak scene. According to observers, if the wind direction does not change, the eastern part of Hong Kong will be slightly affected. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's "Soochow" and Jardine Matheson's "Mingsheng" both turned back halfway.

Fire and Police Departments Prepare to Respond; At the same time, various agencies, the Fire Department, and the Police Department, with the increasing pressure of the wind and the high possibility of an attack, immediately ordered all team members to be forbidden from leaving the station. The police department increased special police deployments to maintain public order, while the fire department took on all fire matters and various accidents.

Seaside Businesses Add Floodgates; At the same time, the situation on land also became tense. Businesses in Hong Kong and across the sea were prepared to respond to the typhoon's arrival. Many signs were tied down or immediately removed, and doors facing the wind were mostly closed tightly. Businesses and residents in coastal areas and low-lying areas were also busy setting up floodgates in front of their doors to prevent floods. Although there was still no rain at night, there were significantly fewer pedestrians on the streets. However, there were many people densely watching the tides along the coast.

Bleak Scenes at Swimming Beaches in Various Districts; At遊棚 in North Point, Seven Sisters, across from Lai Chi Kok, and Sai Wan, there were many swimmers every weekend and holiday. Yesterday morning, there was drizzling rain and a chilly wind, so there were fewer swimmers. After Typhoon Signals No. 1 and No. 7 were hoisted, even fewer swimmers dared to come. Swimmers already in the water also ran away. The various swimming pools, in view of the approaching typhoon, had already removed banners and electric lights, etc., to prevent accidents. By night, swimmers at the beaches had disappeared completely. In addition, the sampan race originally scheduled to be held by the South China Aquatic Arts Association yesterday was postponed to the 30th of this month due to rain.

Hong Kong Observatory Weather Report; At 5:40 PM yesterday afternoon, the Observatory reported that a mild anti-cyclone extended from the three northeastern provinces to the Pacific Ocean east of Japan. Also, at 2:00 PM, the typhoon was moving away from Hong Kong to the southwest and west, blowing to the north-northeast, threatening the coast between Hong Kong and Shantou. It is predicted that Hong Kong will have northeast winds today, mild at first, then turning into strong winds, cloudy with rain.

Latest News, May Not Hit; According to the Hong Kong Observatory's weather report, the typhoon is now located between 20 degrees North latitude and 114 degrees East longitude, with a force center of 30 miles in circumference, blowing north-northeast, about 200-300 miles away from Hong Kong. The Observatory hoisted Typhoon Signal No. 1 at 10:15 AM yesterday morning, and then changed to Typhoon Signal No. 7 at 4:30 PM at noon. The No. 7 wind lamp was still issued at night, and all ships had already sailed into the typhoon shelter for temporary shelter. Civil aviation flights were also delayed. According to the latest wind direction judgment, the typhoon may not hit Hong Kong.

### More Than a Dozen Overseas Chinese Organizations Jointly Hold; National Spiritual Mobilization Oath Ceremony; Scheduled for June 3rd in Kowloon; Thousands of People Expected to Participate

As the War of Resistance has entered the second stage, spirit is more important than military affairs.

### Hong Kong's Foreign Trade; More Favorable Than Before; Cargo Volume Reached More Than 12 Million Yuan in the First Quarter of This Year

Since the Japanese invaded southern China and captured Guangzhou, land and sea transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong has been completely cut off. However, Hong Kong's foreign trade has been able to maintain its excellent position under these special circumstances, which is contrary to the general concerns of people who worried that Hong Kong's trade would be severely hit. The total volume of Hong Kong's cargo transportation in the first quarter of this year is actually better compared to the months before Guangzhou fell last year. The total trade volume of the first quarter of the past two years is recorded below to illustrate this point.

### Cholera Outbreak Intensifies!

Hong Kong has a dense population, and the spread of cholera is common every summer. This summer, the health authorities have been paying close attention to the occurrence of cholera and urging citizens to take precautions. However, eight cases of cholera have still appeared this week. The total number to date is 31, five of which were imported from other ports. The health authorities have decided to hold broadcasts in both Chinese and English in the short term to extensively launch the "Cholera" prevention campaign. In addition, Mr. Ho Kam-tong recently went to various refugee camps to explain the initial treatment methods.

### Hong Kong Income Tax; Not Expected to be Collected Temporarily; Earliest is 1941; Progressive System to Ensure Fairness

The Hong Kong Tax Source Committee's report was submitted to the authorities for review at the Legislative Council meeting the other day. Of the various tax increases recommended by the committee to the government, the income tax item has attracted considerable attention from the public. According to news obtained by reporters from official sources, when the Hong Kong authorities implement income tax in the future, it will adopt a progressive system, with the lowest tax rate starting at 2% (taxing those with the lowest income) and the highest tax rate at 10% (taxing those with the highest income). The timing of the introduction of income tax has not yet been decided and is still awaiting investigation into whether the Hong Kong situation is suitable for this tax system, and then implemented. Therefore, at a minimum, it must wait until January 1, 1941, before it is possible to realize. To seek a fair fixed amount of income tax, there are two methods: (1) Increase the tax-free income amount. Those who exceed the fixed amount will be taxed at 10%. (2) Lower the tax-free income amount and set a standard tax rate, taxing at 5%. The implementation of the progressive system must be determined according to the taxpayer's family burden. Taxpayers can request the deduction of their personal expenses and other uses before determining the amount of tax to be levied. If the above first method is adopted, the standard levy amount is 10%, the tax-free income amount is set at 400 yuan per month, and the maximum amount for personal expenses is 200 yuan. Married individuals will increase this amount by 50 yuan per month for each child. If the above two methods are the basis, the tax difference between the highest income earners and the lowest income earners can also be expanded.

### Chinese Righteous School; Relief for Out-of-School Refugee Children; Registration is Enthusiastic, Reaching 3,000; Five More Registration Locations Added

The Chinese Righteous School, sponsored by the Out-of-School Refugee Children Relief Committee, has begun to register refugee children in recent days. The number of participants has reached 3,000. In order to make the purpose and content of the school's righteous school clear to the refugee compatriots staying in Hong Kong, the association's authorities specially sent teachers to distribute the charter and explain it verbally. Various schools here also provided assistance. Recently, the number of registration locations has increased again. On the Kowloon side, there are Zhiyong Middle School, Guangda Primary School, and Mind University High School. On the Hong Kong side, there are Mingming School and the Second Righteous School of the New Society Chamber of Commerce. In addition, since the Provincial Relief Committee has allocated funds to the association in Hong Kong, there has been no fundraising activity here. We hope that enthusiastic people in society who wish to sponsor this initiative will send their donations to the Provincial Relief Committee. Yesterday (Sunday), the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Refugee Children Free School" held a flower sale to raise funds. Many people in society did not understand and mistakenly believed that it was organized by the association, and inquired about the inside story. According to Mr. Tan Boyang, the person in charge, the Chinese Righteous School organized by the association is handled with funds allocated by the Guangdong Provincial Relief Committee and does not require holding flower sales to raise funds or solicit donations from outside. It has been found that the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Refugee Children Free School" selling flowers to raise funds yesterday is actually another organization.

### Second Public Housing Estate

Currently Under Construction for Several Months and Near Completion

To provide relief to the poor, the Hong Kong government previously constructed a public housing estate in Ma Tau Chung. The first building with forty units has been completed and opened. Forty households who passed the examination by the Chinese and Western Emergency Refugee Committee have moved in. However, more than 300 households have applied for admission, but all were not admitted because they were full. Seeing this, the authorities are now speeding up the construction of the second building nearby. The project has been underway for more than a month. If there are no special delays, it will be completed in a few months and will continue to accommodate people. Those who want to apply for admission can obtain a registration form from various overseas Chinese groups and apply for admission. In addition, the Hong Kong Homeless Relief Association has closed all its dormitories. The executives felt that it would be a pity to leave them empty in the summer, so they wanted to use them to accommodate the poor, but this plan is still under consideration.

### Today's Happy Valley Horse Racing Starts at 12:30 PM, With Two Races First, Followed by Eight Races

According to the observatory's report yesterday, although a hurricane was detected near Hong Kong and Typhoon Signal No. 7 was issued, the wind only intensified throughout the day without any rain. If the weather is sunny today, the turf should be slightly better than on Saturday and Sunday, but it is still likely to be soft and slippery. If the horses participating in the race are good at running on soft ground, we should bet as we did the other day, and there should be no major mistakes. However, since there is no need to avoid the rain, we can sit and watch comfortably, and it is also convenient to move around. It is expected that there will be a considerable increase in the number of spectators today.

Special Report by Our Newspaper

### A Scene from "China Rescue" Yesterday: "Thief"!

— Qi Zhuo

"Thief"... Targeting Hong Kong Society

The China Rescue Drama Troupe's three performances yesterday were all sold out. What the reporter wants to especially introduce is the first act of "Defend the Motherland," "Thief." Because the gorgeous scenery and witty plot of "Thief" are especially suitable for the taste of the general Hong Kong audience.

The consciousness of "Thief" is aimed at the upper class of XX society.

The curtain opens, and applause rises, because the Westernized family, the deep three-dimensional architecture, the sparkling stars, and the sounds of the chapel all make many people regard it as the pinnacle of "beauty" and applaud. In fact, the truth of the "China Rescue" from the front lines and the countryside is not so, this is just a toolbox for setting off the plot.

The main theme of the play is to show that a wealthy family does not realize the truth that "if the skin is gone, what will the hair adhere to? Only with a country can there be a home" until after they are robbed and enlightened by the "thief."

Wang Ying plays the young mistress, and Jin Shan plays the young master. Their decadent life is a portrayal of the licentious class in the city. The affairs of the country? Who cares! These two villainous characters are very hateful! They are two completely different people from Jin Shan and Wang Ying after they leave the stage. If their thinking were not armed, the licentious life on the stage might be their daily life. The two kinds of people and the two kinds of superb acting skills aroused a surge of thoughts in the reporter.

The young master's younger siblings—Fan Zheng and Qin Xiaozhu—came to the silver shop in their home to donate money to save the country. It can be seen that two different characters can also grow up in the same environment.

Another thief—played by Su Hui—is the XX of the people. After he explained his lament, the young master's parents made him bankrupt: life forced him to be a "gentleman on the roof"—Zi Ying, played by Ke Gang, is very suitable—they were all moved, sympathized with him, and forgave him, so they gave him a bowl of bird's nest. The "thief" said that bird's nest could not save a stomach that had been hungry for many days, and asked for leftovers. The young master actually said, "Bird's nest has Vitamin A!"

"When XX comes! There will be nothing left!"

"If the country is not strong, can individuals still have a good life?"

"..."

These three thieves persuaded the whole family—except for the young mistress who was unrepentant until death—amidst thunderous applause, the parents even gave the "three thieves" the items in the house and the silver that had just been stolen to donate money to save the country, and personally sent them out the door. ——Can the upper class in Hong Kong have such facts?

Wake up! Young mistresses!

The young mistress returning from a mahjong game (played by Wang Ying)

### The Situation in Eastern Guangdong is Deteriorating Daily; Our Guerrilla Force is Extremely Active, Launching Two-Pronged Attacks on Shilong and Shitan, Achieving a Great Victory; More Than a Hundred X Troops in Chicheng and Baima Were Ambushed and Annihilated

[Huizhou Express] On the eastern Guangdong front, the X army is under our attack, and the situation is deteriorating. Although they have received reinforcements many times, they have all been annihilated by our army, which proves that the X army's source of troops is exhausted, and the signs of failure are evident.

Wu Wang's Regiment Presses Shilong: In Shilong, X and I are fighting for the stronghold. After many fierce battles, X's forces are exhausted. There are only about 500 troops (mixed troops) stationed there, entrenched and defending to the death. Our army's Security No. X Regiment, led by Wu Kangjian, is advancing with our Peng Division in Zhucun, Zhongxin Market, and other places northwest of Shilong, which is very tense. Taking advantage of the opportunity, they launched a surprise attack on Shilong and Shitan yesterday at 2 a.m., coordinated with the guerrilla force led by Wang Ruozhou. One group moved from Nanshe, and the other advanced from Hengyong. First, they defeated the X troops, and then they advanced towards Shilong Town. X responded hastily. Before long, our regiment used hand grenades to destroy X's fortifications and charged bravely. X was exhausted and retreated into the town, stubbornly resisting from the buildings. When our regiment approached the outskirts of the town, they all threw hand grenades fiercely at X's positions, destroying more than ten houses, annihilating dozens of X soldiers, and capturing more than ten rifles. The X troops in Shitan were also severely attacked by our Hengyong regiment, killing many X soldiers. By dawn, our regiment had completed its mission and safely returned to its original defense area.

X Troops in Chicheng Were Ambushed and Annihilated: The X troops in Guancheng are under our army's strict surveillance and cannot advance an inch. However, recently, the X army has been frequently transporting supplies on the Longtai Highway and has often harassed De Village near the highway, looting civilian food, and forcibly recruiting our strong men to replenish the ranks of puppet soldiers in order to struggle. Our Security Regiment, led by Wu, stationed for defense, in order to cut off the X troops' connection between Guantai, specially coordinated with the local guerrilla force yesterday to attack Baima, Chicheng, and other areas from Liaobu, Dashalu, and other places, and ambushed near Xiashanmen. After contacting the X troops, they pretended to retreat. X chased closely. When they reached Xiashanmen, our ambush force surrounded them, and more than a hundred X soldiers were annihilated. Now the regiment is still attacking the Chicheng area to cut off the X troops' connection between Guantai.

### Our Guerrilla Force in Qiongzhou Island Attacked Wenchang City Again, Destroying Many X Fortifications; X Troops Disturbed Various Villages to Vent Their Anger

[Nanlu Express] Our isolated army and guerrilla force in Qiongzhou Island, under the command of Commander Wang Yi, have become increasingly active, inflicting heavy damage on X. The recent situation is as follows:

Our Guerrilla Force Attacks Wenchang: Yang Yongren, the commander of the eastern Qiongya guerrilla force, believes that X is actively building airports and warehouses in Wenchang City, forcing nearby villagers to complete the surrounding road network, attempting to create an important base for land and air forces. He ordered all guerrilla forces to seize the opportunity to attack X and destroy as much as possible. It was found that on the morning of the 19th of this month, more than 300 guerrillas from our Yang's unit rushed into Wenchang City and launched a fierce attack on X's headquarters, taking X by surprise. More than a hundred people were killed, and many fortifications were destroyed. After completing their mission, our guerrilla force withdrew safely as a whole unit. X, enraged, sent more than 500 X soldiers to harass dozens of villages, large and small, including Chenjia Village, Shagang, and Liwu, to vent their anger.

X Planes Bombard Extensively for Days: In addition, X troops attempted to eliminate our guerrilla base area. They have been setting fires to burn mountains continuously in recent days, cutting down and burning all the trees in the villages. Recently, Zhang also sent large teams of aircraft to bomb various places in Qiongzhou Island every day. Longzhou and Da'an villages in Ding'an County were bombed miserably on the 17th and 18th, attempting to raze the villages to the ground so that our guerrillas and security forces would have no way to hide. However, the mountains and ridges in the inland of Qiongya are continuous, and our army and civilians have penetrated deep into Zhongshan to carry out activities. X's attempt is just a dream.

### Investigation of the Distribution of X Troops in Guangdong; Approximately 40,000 to 50,000 People in Total

(Wengyuan Express) The X army on various lines in Guangdong Province has recently launched extremely frequent operations. It has been found that they are changing defense posts. In recent months, they have still been busy building fortifications and deploying defenses. Their frequent movements and aggressive posture are actually intended to contain our army's attacks. Currently, there are approximately 40,000 to 50,000 X troops in Guangdong Province. According to intelligence from a certain agency, their distribution is as follows: (1) There are approximately 1,000 people in Hutou and Taiping, belonging to the Iijima Yuhara Middle Village Lian Marine Corps; (2) The 56th Regiment of the 18th Division of X is stationed in Shilong, Shitan, and Zengcheng, and the 51st Regiment is stationed in Zhongluotan, Taipingchang, and Shegang. The 24th and 34th Regiments are deployed in the suburbs of Guangzhou; (3) A part of the 104th Division of X, approximately one regiment, is deployed on the Guanghua Road and south of Xinjie on the Yuehan Road, with the main force concentrated in the suburbs of Guangzhou; (4) In Sanshui, Xinan, Foshan, Jiujiang, Jiangmen, Xinhui, and other places, there are approximately two regiments of X infantry and a part of cavalry and artillery, which seem to belong to the 26th Division; (5) The Taiwan garrison team, the Iida release group, is still entrenched on the South China Sea Island, stationed in Chengmai, Ding'an, Haikou, Wenchang, and Lehui. Another large team of marines is in Jiusuo Yaxian Tengqiao. In addition, the X troops in Guangdong have recently been actively recruiting puppet troops and reorganizing puppet organizations, attempting to implement their poisonous plan to rule the occupied areas by using Chinese people to control Chinese people.

### Shantou Merchants Discount Agricultural Bank's Legal Tender; Central Branch Strictly Prohibits It

(Shantou Correspondence) Shantou merchants discriminate against and discount banknotes of the Farmers Bank, and the authorities have issued a notice strictly prohibiting such practices. All Farmers Bank banknotes are to be used equally with the legal banknotes of the Central Bank, China Bank, and Bank of Communications. However, citizens still discount and discriminate against them. Recently, the surcharge has been as high as ten yuan per thousand yuan. Farmers Bank banknotes can be used to pay taxes to the customs tax collection office of the Central Bank in Shantou. Therefore, when merchants pay taxes, they all use Farmers Bank banknotes. The customs tax collection office receives approximately 100,000 yuan every day, which is all received by the Central Bank and transferred to Hong Kong. Approximately 300,000 yuan is transferred every month. According to Li Shouren, the president of the Central Bank in this city, the discrimination and discounting of Farmers Bank banknotes have been reported to the authorities, who have issued a notice strictly prohibiting such practices, but the discounting has not been curbed. Recently, the discount has become even lower. The bank has telegraphed its head office for instructions on prohibition.

### Qiongzhou Island X Wounded Soldiers Transported to Weizhou for Medical Treatment; Only a Hundred X Troops on Weizhou

[Beihai Express] There are still more than a hundred X soldiers on Weizhou Island. They are secretly building air defense fortifications in Catholic churches with the iron bars that have been transported to the island, forcing the islanders to live in the X airport, sending troops into the countryside, and searching everywhere. The property of the islanders has been looted. At the same time, X committed a crime in Huanzi Village but failed. They burned all forty to fifty houses in the village and took more than ten people away, whose fate is unknown. A few days ago, an X transport ship transported more than thirty X wounded soldiers from Haikou, including five seriously wounded, to Weizhou Island. After that, more than twenty X soldiers were said to have boarded the ship from Rangzhou Island and sailed towards Haikou. According to passengers entering Qiongzhou by ship, there were no traces of X ships on the sea from Weizhou to Guantouling. The rumor that an aircraft carrier had returned to Weizhou was inaccurate. However, there were seven X ships in Haikou.

### Jiujiang X Attempts to Cross Illegally; X Ships Bomb Sanzhou, Repelled by Us

[Xijiang Express] X in Jiujiang in the lower reaches of the Xijiang River has repeatedly attacked Heshan, attempting to contain our army. However, they have been severely attacked by our Longguang unit. On the 27th, X in Jiujiang used shallow-water ships to fire artillery to cover their landing in Daqueshan and Huangpinkeng. They attempted to attack Shaping Gubao and other places again. Our local defense forces immediately attacked X's ships and drove them back to Jiujiang on the opposite bank. On the morning of the 28th, four X ships sailed from Tingdou to the Taiping sea area and fired more than twenty artillery shells at Bian and Lanke villages in Sanzhou. Our defense forces also fired back. We and X exchanged fire for about two hours before the X ships sailed towards Jiujiang.

### Guerrilla Warfare Widely Launched in Conghua and Huaxian Areas; X Troops Repeatedly Attacked in Jiangcun and Taihe; X Anxious and Convened a Meeting of All Ugly Elements to Discuss Countermeasures

[Beijiang Express] The X army in the Cong (hua) and Hua (xian) areas still focuses on defense. Although there are occasional deployments, they are nothing more than a smokescreen of "advancing as retreating." The Second District Column, in coordination with the various departments of the Twelfth Army Group, has now launched extensive guerrilla warfare and has inflicted considerable damage on the X army in recent days. The situation is as follows:

Launch Extensive Guerrilla Warfare: It has been found that Conghua and Huaxian are the front lines of the Beijiang. In order to prevent our army from going south and to defend the outer perimeter of Guangzhou, X has a considerable defense force. Wu Guanqi, commander of the Second District Guerrilla Column, received an order from Ye Zhaolun, deputy commander of the Twelfth Army Group, to thoroughly promote extensive guerrilla warfare in order to support the regular army in launching a strong counterattack. Wu immediately ordered all the large teams to actively move. Large numbers of our guerrillas have been found to be active in Jiangcun, Banghu, Taihe, Shijing, Gaotang, and other places. Whether in public places, teahouses, or opium dens, there are people mixed in to carry out various anti-X propaganda activities. Every eight or nine o'clock, our guerrillas launched separate attacks on X, and gunshots rang out everywhere. As a result, order was disrupted, and many young people automatically joined the guerrillas, while the old, weak, women, and children fled to safe areas.

X Puppet Meeting to Discuss Countermeasures: After our guerrilla teams launched extensive guerrilla warfare in the above-mentioned areas, they inflicted a lot of damage on the X army. X was in a state of being surrounded on all sides. They had a wonderful idea and specially convened all the members of the puppet maintenance association and the heads of the various villages at the X headquarters in Jiangcun on the 24th to hold a so-called "pacification joint defense" meeting to discuss countermeasures. The meeting lasted for five or six hours before it adjourned. The X commander held a joint party at the puppet maintenance association in the afternoon to win over the hearts of the various traitors and puppets. The resolutions reached at the X traitor meeting that day included: (1) Thoroughly suppress the guerrilla forces. If X troops are attacked in the future, each village shall be responsible. The puppets in charge of the local puppet maintenance association shall also bear corresponding responsibility. Minor offenders will be recorded, and serious offenders will be dismissed or executed; (2) Remove the forests in the area where the X troops are stationed and block remote areas to prevent guerrilla teams from hiding and attacking on narrow paths; (3) All opium and gambling dens are prohibited from staying open all night or providing lodging to prevent guerrilla teams from mixing in; (4) Those who report guerrilla teams in each village will be rewarded by the X army. Those who knowingly fail to report will be punished as accomplices. Judging from the various resolutions decided by the X army, we can see the panic and anxiety they are experiencing.

### Beihai Merchants Telegraph Request for Equalization of Foreign Exchange Rate Spreads; Request to Supplement and Pay Hong Kong Dollars Denied

(Beihai Express) The Beihai Chamber of Commerce convened more than twenty representatives of various firms yesterday to discuss the letter from the Beihai Animal Tax Office, which stated that those who had previously supplemented and paid the price of foreign exchange sold and settled in national currency must uniformly supplement and pay Hong Kong dollars and return the national currency. The merchants believed that the Beihai Customs Tax Collection Office currently sells and settles foreign exchange, and the expenditure is calculated at 1.8 national currency per Hong Kong dollar, while the income is calculated at 1.87 national currency per Hong Kong dollar, which is actually 70 yuan more in national currency per thousand yuan. Therefore, they telegraphed the superior to order the issuance of the excess amount and stipulate the same price for both entry and exit to ensure fairness. Now, the General Administration Office has sent a letter to decorate the Tax Collection Office and take back the city price difference, while the Animal Tax Office wants the merchants to supplement and pay Hong Kong dollars in exchange for national currency, which is difficult to comply with. We are now waiting for the superior to resolve it.

### Our Team in Northern Guangdong Organized a Commando Team to Search for Remnant X Troops; X Has a "Sweeping Team" Organization, Used Only for Robbing Food

(Qujiang Express) After the remnant X troops in northern Guangdong were severely annihilated by our army, they have not dared to disturb the people in recent days. They are only resting in their strongholds. Occasionally, they send out so-called "sweeping teams" to rob food and raw materials from various villages. There are currently two X infantry companies and one artillery company between Huaxian and Longkou. There is one infantry company in Fengyong. Between Zengcheng and Fuhe Zhucun, there is a joint team of X infantry, artillery, and cavalry, totaling approximately 1,000 people. The X headquarters is still located in Xinjie. In order to crush X's sweeping conspiracy, our army specially selected elite troops from the front-line units to form a commando team, which departed to search for remnant X troops.

### Provincial Relief Association Investigates Relief Funds in Various Counties

(Shaoguan Express) The Provincial Relief Association previously allocated relief funds to the relief associations in various counties for the purpose of providing relief to refugees. The Relief Association has never reported how the funds were kept, whether they were used, or other matters. In order to clarify the truth and facilitate overall planning, the Association issued an instruction yesterday, requiring the relief associations in various counties to report on the custody of the relief funds received and stored within three days of receiving the document for verification and handling. It also stipulated that if the funds were used in the future, they should be reported at any time.

### Provincial Government Instructs Subordinates to Prevent X from Poisoning Salt; Several Cases Discovered in Nanxiong and Renhua

(Qujiang Express) The Provincial Government issued an instruction to its subordinates yesterday, stating: "According to Tan Shi, the magistrate of Nanxiong County, salt was recently discovered to have been poisoned by X in Fuxi Market in the county and Changjiang Market in neighboring Renhua County. When the salt is stir-fried in a wok, it turns red, green, black, and other colors. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and no one was harmed. Please inform your subordinates to be vigilant." This shows X's malicious intent to harm us. Therefore, you are instructed to inform and disseminate this information.

### Zhongshan to Implement Cigarette Management Starting Next Month; Registration Began the Day Before Yesterday

(Zhongshan Express) Zhang Huichang, the magistrate of Zhongshan County, and Lu Zhixiong, the director of the Taxation Bureau, received a telegram from Gu Yiqun, the director of the Finance Department, stating that in order to implement the central government's thrift policy and cultivate the people's strength, cigarette management will be implemented starting from June 1. A management fee of 35% will be levied according to the wholesale price. All regulations have been promulgated. In order to prevent malpractices, the following emergency measures have been formulated with reference to successful cases in various provinces: From the 21st to June 10, all cigarettes currently stored and imported by tobacco merchants in the province will be temporarily suspended from being exported out of the province. The existing and accumulated cigarette brands, quantities, destinations, and other items to be transferred and transported shall be registered with the Taxation Bureau. Those who resist registration will be sealed up. Those who violate the order and transport them out of the province privately will be detained and punished to warn against cunning. After receiving the telegram, the county fear bureau chief immediately summoned the tobacco merchants in the area under his jurisdiction to give them a detailed explanation and strictly ordered the military and police agencies under his jurisdiction to provide practical assistance without any favoritism or negligence. He also telegraphed back to report on the implementation and the registered quantities. Magistrate Zhang and Director Ying have complied with the order and implemented it, and registration will be carried out on the 27th.

### Zhongshan Organizes a Volunteer Team to Thoroughly Destroy Highways; Limited to Completely Destroying Them by the End of This Month

(Zhongshan Express) Zhang Huichang, the magistrate of Zhongshan County, has strictly ordered the chiefs of various districts to thoroughly destroy the highways, recruit strong men, and speed up the process. After receiving the order, the chiefs of various districts separately convened meetings of the heads of various villages on the 27th to organize volunteer teams of men and strong men, who were gathered at a certain place that day to take on the task of destroying the highways and were limited to completely destroying the highways by the end of this month.

### The Lifespan of Male and Female Performers: Female Performers Have Shorter Lifespans Than Male Performers

I remember that Ferbert had a table of statistics on the lifespan of performers in "Twentieth Century Theater," which looked like this:

Average lifespan of famous male performers: over 66 years old

Average lifespan of famous female performers: over 61 years old

Average lifespan of ordinary male performers: 45 years old

Average lifespan of ordinary female performers: over 37 years old

Average lifespan of male performers: 55 years old

Average lifespan of female performers: 49 years old

According to the table above, female performers generally have shorter lifespans than male performers. This is probably because women are mostly physically weak. As for famous performers, they live longer than ordinary performers, of course, because they have broad minds, are carefree, and have no worries. On the other hand, how can the lives of ordinary performers who eat breakfast but have no dinner and are tormented by poverty be long?

Speaking of Chinese performers, the old antique performers of the past often lived to be fifty, sixty, seventy, or eighty years old. Nowadays, there are fewer who live long. Mixing in female colors and eating black rice are really two deadly injuries.

### After Watching "Sweethearts"

— Bai Hua Sweethearts MGM Production

I think the screenwriter of "Sweethearts" is quite innocent and lovely. He really tells us this kind of story: "On Broadway, a playwright, for a special relationship, broke up a loving couple. His trick was to make a wife believe that her husband was having an affair with their female secretary. He sent someone to steal the love letters the husband wrote to his wife and put them into the script, letting the wife believe that her husband also had a similar letter written to that female secretary." The so-called "special relationship" is also related to conflicts of interest with the producer of the couple. However, the screenwriter also showed his cleverness. The couple are famous stage stars on Broadway, and because of the invitation of Hollywood film companies, he came up with this plan to prevent them from going to Hollywood. But because of the screenwriter's cleverness, he also told us about the secret competition between Hollywood and Broadway for hiring famous actors.

"Sweethearts" is Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy's first color film. Because it is a color film, the director, Mr. Van Dyke, has done his best in costumes, scenery, and props to make them luxurious, quiet, and harmonious. For example, the three-act opera at the beginning, the simplicity and beauty of the first scene of the Dutch farmer's song, the bright and dazzling second scene of "The Fate of the Play," and the harmonious beauty of the third scene of "Sweethearts." Not only that, but in every scene, the director is very careful in the color matching. When Jeanette MacDonald wears a brightly colored shirt in the dressing room and puts on makeup in front of the mirror, the color not only sets off MacDonald's beauty even more, but it also feels very comfortable to watch. There is also MacDonald's fashion show, which indeed introduces the popular new costumes in Hollywood, but isn't it also showing the function of color films?

Have you seen "Marie Antoinette"? Were you moved by Van Dyke's excellent skills? (That's about the life of Marie Antoinette, not a history of the French Revolution.) But "Sweethearts" is a comedy. It reverses that kind of profound and moving delicate depiction. The whole film develops in a light and cheerful melody, all the way to the end. What I particularly like is the scene where MacDonald listens to the playwright's new script. The couple is getting ready to leave, but it is disrupted by the appearance of the playwright. This scene uses music to set off MacDonald's psychological state, which is very lovely, especially the transition.

Don't you like Loretta Young in "Wives Under Suspicion"? Then, Franklin Pangborn, who plays the producer, Felix Lehman, is also equally lovable.

### Deanna Durbin Has Changed; She Actually Looks Like an Adult

Deanna Durbin, this is a lovely girl, is gradually growing up. She is now wearing high heels, long clothes, and adult-like hats. She is sixteen years old this year, "Soon to be seventeen," she will tell you that.

In a certain scene in the filming of "Three Smart Girls Grow Up," the floor was very smooth, and there was a huge mirror hanging on the wall. Deanna was wearing a light pink and silver evening dress (this was the first time she wore this way on camera). When she walked out generously, she immediately saw herself in the mirror, how eye-catching and beautiful the clothes she was wearing. She moved forward solemnly, while paying attention to the reflection on the floor and the shadow in the mirror. So beautiful, indeed she is much bigger.

Deanna no longer eats ice cream and sweets. She eats regularly. She never drinks coffee, but she still likes milk. She no longer chews gum. Now she is very interested in reading. In the past year, she has read six or seven famous novels.

She has learned to dance. Now she can dance the fox trot and the Peabody, but she has not yet learned the steps of "Jitterbuy." She can also drive a car, and she has also obtained a driver's license.

### Drama School Produced by MGM Starring Luise Rainer, Allyn Joslyn, and Paulette Goddard

"I envy you will see one day how you succeed," Anna felt astonished. "Going to school during the day, and doing this lowly work all night. Not one night can sleep comfortably." Their job was assembling gas meters on the night shift in a factory. A class has to work ten hours. A large group of withered women monotonously move their hands to tighten the screws on the fittings that are moved over on the belt.

Luise said: "That is easy. I always think of poor Dusi, who often slept on park benches at first."

But that was not really easy. Every day her eyes were gradually closing, and she felt her head was so heavy that it was not easy to stand upright on her shoulders. But in drama school, she had to stand straight! Must strictly train in fencing, fitness, and posture. Then must rehearse drama, during rehearsal time, have to walk with books on their heads to get perfect balance.

She was always so tired. Classmates—even teachers—believed she was too diligent. Because she was too tired to be happy, they thought she was arrogant and aloof. Luise ignored it. Not only did self-esteem make her do this, although she knew that classmates would definitely laugh at her "private life" if they found out. She didn't really care about their ridicule. But she had a need in her heart to create a new personality to play the role she created herself.

"So sorry!" If someone asked her to join the extracurricular games of her classmates, she always said to them like this. "I would love to participate, but I am too busy with work." There was no other explanation. This kind of attitude often made some students unhappy. Who did she think she was anyway? (To be continued)

### Yesterday's Charity Football Match South China Cleanly Defeated Mixed Team Three to Zero Feng Jingxiang Twice Opened the Scoring with Headers

(Our Newspaper's Provisional Report) Yesterday afternoon, the Observatory hoisted Typhoon Signal No. 7. The general public thought that the charity football match would probably not be held again. By five o'clock, the wind and rain had not yet arrived. Therefore, this game, which had been postponed several times, was finally held at Jia Mountain. There were also thousands of spectators present.

The lineup had changed. Many players from the Allied team were absent, so players from South China were temporarily transferred to join as guest players. Therefore, the name of the Allied team should be canceled and changed to a Mixed Team.

Hou Rongsheng still played for the Mixed Team. As for the right inside midfielder position for South China, it was taken by Mai Shaohan, who had been absent for a long time due to a foot injury and had now recovered.

During the match, Kai Youyao shone brightly. However, as several opponents of Xing Huawei were "family members," he could not help but show mercy, so there was no fierce competition.

The South China forwards were very active. Individual techniques, such as those of Feng Jingxiang and Li Zhaorong, were wonderfully displayed, forming a pleasing sight. Luo Douwen also made many good plays. Li Huitang had few opportunities to be active. Although he took advantage of opportunities to shoot several times, he was unsuccessful. Therefore, yesterday was actually the day to break his own record of winning every match he played in. The central midfielder Liu Qingcai, advancing and retreating, was able to provide great assistance to the forwards and defenders. The other players also performed satisfactorily.

The Mixed Team's players lacked coordination. It seemed that they were fighting individually. Hou Chengtao's dribbling was solid, but he was unable to act according to the situation. He was often intercepted by the South China defenders. Yang Shui had several chances to score, but he failed to hit the target. Center-back Dixon was the most outstanding person on the field. He closely guarded Li Huitang on one hand and provided the forwards with excellent passes on the other. His footwork was light and he kicked with extraordinary ease. Li Anna, playing out of position as an inside forward, also looked steady. De Gasson saved many dangerous shots. Although they lost by a score of three to zero, it was not his fault.

Buddha Lord Wants to Start Killing Dehui Fails to Score with Header

The weather was about to turn bad, with wind and rain coming. Fortunately, the heavens had mercy and provided convenience, preventing the event from being delayed again. Thus, surrounded by the eager anticipation of thousands of spectators, the battle was launched on time.

As the horn sounded, the two armies moved out and fought several rounds against each other. Suddenly, Feng "2-1" charged forward, luring Jingcheng to attack, finding an empty space, and giving "Buddha Lord" a very good opportunity. Wang waited to aim at the "dragon gate," wanting to start killing.

Knowing that Yang Genbao met the attack, he eradicated the "Buddha Lord" desire. Although it resulted in a corner kick, it was not worth worrying about.

Guo Wei committed a foul in the midfield. Dixon passed a free kick to Shuiyi, who immediately cut in. The momentum was very good. Dehui arrived at the ball and used his head to strike towards the goal. However, the ball hit the post and bounced into the wilderness, scaring Jiaping.

Douwen's Wonderful Corner Kick Second Uncle Performs Meritorious Service

You attacked, I defended, the situation was tense and exciting. Then "Ball Monster" got the ball and passed it left and right. Douwen got the ball and used all his strength, passing by Genbao. The corner kick was wonderfully executed. Anna failed to head it. De Gasson was vacant. It fell from "Second Uncle"'s head. A little nod from his head broke De Gasson's policy. The "Chen Boss" sitting next to me kept praising "Second Uncle" for this move.

South China won first, and the momentum was strong. In the blink of an eye, Jing Huo Huo, and Zhaorong passed to each other, as if two dragons were playing with a ball. As he approached the enemy's gate, Jingxiang immediately shot low, but De Gasson, having learned from the lesson just now, was prepared. As the ball flew over, he quickly squatted down and embraced it fully.

Ball Monster First Fires Canon Douwen Has Excellent Plays

Tuo Ban was restless, but because the forwards did not cooperate, he could not go deep. Occasionally, he launched a couple of flanking attacks, but they were futile.

Jingxiang had good skills. He dribbled the ball in midfield, making Qiu Chen unable to touch it. After a while, Huitang, received Jingxiang's assistance and fired the first shot, but it was saved by De Gasson.

Chengtao sought an opportunity to advance and went deep to the baseline. But when he met Su Zai, he could no longer advance. In a hurry, he cut the ball, but it was "far from the topic."

Douwen had excellent plays, which were very satisfactory. Once, with the help of Zhaorong, he passed the ball forcefully, crossing the "dragon gate," just falling at Guangsen's feet. Seeing this opportunity, Guangsen refused to let it go and drew back his bow and shot fiercely, but it was blocked by De Gasson and then cleared by Jingcheng.

Guo Wei entangled Tuo Ban, causing an infringement foul. Fortunately, it was not in the penalty area. Shuiyi took the free kick, landing on Chengtao's side, but he failed to head it. Shuiyi got it again and cut it in beautifully. Dehui施以頂上功夫, but it fell outside.

Shijin Has Nothing Good to Say Jingxiang Reports Another Happy News

Douwen made a comeback, and Genbao came out to meet him, but he ate one backhanded, and lost another corner kick. Douwen opened it, and Huichang received it and shot, but it did not hit. Then Huichang hid at the baseline on the left, got a wonderful pass from Guo Wei, turned around and knocked on the door, performing excellently, but De Gasson grabbed the ball and sent it to the front.

Shijin repeatedly failed to advance, and he did not cooperate with Chengtao, so there was nothing good to praise.

Soon, the South China forwards were active in the front again. Zhaorong got the ball and rushed to the baseline, lifted the ball up. Jingxiang then used his old trick, heading on, making De Gasson at a loss, like a startled bird, watching the ball fly in. So South China scored another goal.

After this, South China still had many attacks. Once, Douwen had a wonderful shot, but Jingxiang's final shot was blocked by the crossbar for De Gasson. Before long, the first half was over.

South China's Eventful Autumn The Fuji Corporation Will Be Very Busy

After a short rest, they regrouped and fought again. At this point, the forwards of the Mixed Team performed more vigorously. Soon, Chengtao got a corner kick, but it was ineffective.

Huitang wanted to make a contribution, and he used breakthrough methods several times, entering from the middle, but he was intercepted by Qiuchen in front and blocked by Li Anna behind. He could not move his feet and looked at the door and sighed.

Shuiyi took the opportunity to advance along the side, forcing a corner kick. It opened just right. Dickson intercepted and shot, but it was another wild arrow.

At this time, the members of the Mixed Team were active in the South China no-fly zone, rigorously finding gaps, becoming an eventful autumn, making Tiansheng, Shaohan, etc. quite busy. Once, Shuiyi shot at close range, and Tiansheng blocked the disaster with his back, losing a corner kick. Shuiyi opened it, and Tuo Ban received it and shot at the goal, but it did not hit, but shot the camera of the color taker on the side of the dragon gate, falling to the ground. I do not know if Tuo Ban's move was captured in the lens.

Jiaping Turns Danger into Safety South China Wins Two Clean Balls

Suddenly, horizontal wind and oblique rain, coming in bursts, South China fought against the wind, quite threatened, but the Mixed team's front line communication was loose, although there were opportunities for advancement, they could not make contributions.

After a while, Shuiyi walked to the Liben position, mixed into the middle, and passed the ball to the left. Chengtao got it near the baseline and handed it to Dehui. This was the only winning opportunity for the Mixed Team. It looked like it was bound to go in, but Dehui's shot hit Jiaping's hand, and he took the opportunity to hold it out, turning danger into safety.

Genbao fought bravely, fighting for the ball with Zhaorong, doing a somersault, and losing his belt, almost revealing his true face, causing the whole stadium to laugh.

They fought each other, each advancing and retreating. In the last minute, Rongsheng grabbed the ball and came out, kicking it to the right. Shuiyi did not guard his position, so it was intercepted by Guo Wei. This time, it was actually South China's chance to win again. The ball was sent forward by Guo Wei. Zhaorong intercepted and passed it, just falling in front of Guangsen. He did not wait for the ball to land, lifted his leg and shot, skewing into the net. De Gasson pounced 空, this ball already entered, the armistice笛 was鳴, 南華 defeated a three 比零 clear victory and thus completed the此次筆, although the two 入 was not much, it can be considered as a功德無量了 (ball court 本歳)

### On the Decline of the Shanghai Yen

If the issuance of so-called "Joint Notes" and the use of military scrip were intended, it was unexpected that these types of "notes" and "scrip" could not compete with the Chinese legal tender. Japan, aiming to take advantage of the current tense international situation to complete its attempt to establish a "Yen Bloc" that would exclude the interests of European and American powers in China, is using various methods to transport Japanese banknotes to China. The recent surge in the Shanghai Yen is likely due to this reason. Moreover, the Japanese Yen flowing into the occupied areas of China along with the Japanese army is not regarded as reliable wealth by either Chinese or Japanese merchants. After accepting the Yen, they either immediately exchange it for legal tender or further use the legal tender to speculate in Chinese foreign exchange. As a result, this type of Yen has gradually concentrated in Shanghai, eventually impacting market prices. The Japanese government seems to have anticipated this phenomenon long ago. In recent weeks, the Japanese government has prohibited tourists from carrying Yen to Japan and also disallowed the use of Yen to pay for goods transported from Japan and Northeast China to Shanghai. This is to prevent the Yen's devaluation from backfiring on Japan. Furthermore, the so-called "Joint Notes" linked to the Yen have recently depreciated to below 60 percent. The newly established Huaxing Bank is rumored to be using Yen to buy legal tender, leading to a large influx of Yen into the market. Therefore, the current sharp decline in the Yen's value is indeed the inevitable result of various factors converging. The spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy is certainly not ignorant of this.

Currently, the Yen in China has become a tumor in the Japanese economy. Japan's desired "Yen Bloc" has indeed begun to be implemented, but the currency within a bloc must have the same value. However, the foreign exchange value of the Shanghai Yen is only half of the foreign exchange value of the Yen in Japan. If Japan does not make every effort to support the value of the Yen in China but instead severs the connection between its domestic and foreign Yen, then the illusion of the so-called Yen Bloc will quickly disappear. However, if it wants to vigorously support the price of the Yen in China, can it establish a huge foreign exchange fund for the inflated Yen in China? This is not only beyond Japan's current financial capacity but would also be sufficient to accelerate the collapse of its domestic monetary system.

### Sampan Driving Method

— Pan Yeshao

The driving method discussed here is limited to the scope of sampans that can be steered and rowed. Although there are many other things to learn in order to handle the navigation of various boats, mastering these basic techniques will generally be more helpful and easier to succeed in learning advanced boating skills.

Within the realm of boating techniques, we should not only learn these skills for recreational purposes but also consider practical applications. Therefore, all types of sailboats, double-oared boats, single-scull boats, and sculling boats, whether Chinese or foreign, ancient or modern, are worth practicing for potential needs. However, someone proficient in single-oar sampan driving can easily ride on any floating object by using a paddle. It can be said that as long as something can float, they can stand on it and propel it forward by pushing the water. From this, we can see that if we don't want to achieve anything in water sports, that's one thing; otherwise, learning this technique is of great value. In other words, those with sampan driving skills can enjoy water recreation and have a wide range of uses for simple water tools, both in normal times and in emergencies.

Propelling a boat forward is not difficult, but being able to determine and change its direction at will while the boat is moving forward is daunting for most learners, who don't know how to achieve the goal of independently operating a sampan. The reason for this is actually quite simple.

### Shen Bao Cup Basketball Charity Match Kicks Off Tonight: Zhi Xing vs. Southwest Only One Men's Group B Final

Two Group B finals will also be held, the first at 6:30 PM between Li Xing and Chun Feng, and the second at 8:30 PM between International and Guangzhong, all at the Youth Gymnasium. However, the first match between Li Xing players has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances, so there will only be one match each for men and women.

The women's match is expected to be quite a spectacle, as it is for a charitable cause, and all players will surely do their best to showcase their excellent skills and refresh the audience's eyes. Moreover, many players in the Zhi Xing team are representatives of the National Games, such as Chen Yuntang, Lin Shaoping, Huang Yiru, Sun Yuming, Xi Huizhuang, Deng Yanhao, and Chen Qihuan, who are all experienced and have exceptional combat effectiveness. Southwest is also full of vitality, with players like He Huanxiang, Zhu Zhizhi, Wu Ruixin, Li Chanqing, and Ye Peizhi, all of whom are brave and have excellent fighting spirit. The confrontation between the two teams tonight should be a wonderful performance. The men's Group B match between International and Guangzhong is between teams of similar strength and is bound to be a fierce battle, as Guangzhong is actively improving and International has a strong defense. Both teams have their strengths, making it difficult to predict the outcome. The team rosters are as follows:

### A Whiff of Fragrance and the Jews

— Zhang Chunfeng

On the 26th, a Hong Kong newspaper's news page carried the following news under the flamboyant headline "After a Whiff of Fragrance, Everyone is in Tears":

"Shanghai Special Dispatch: Recently, a strange disease has been spreading here, with patients experiencing uncontrollable tears, as if exposed to tear gas. However, it is only temporary..."

The discovery of this "uncontrollable" strange disease in the bustling streets of Shanghai is indeed startling news. To ensure journalistic integrity, the reporter even interviewed a patient suffering from this strange disease, and the interview was published along with the news to prove the accuracy and credibility of the source. Here is the special dispatch, in the reporter's words:

"The reporter met with a patient of this disease today, who claimed to have smelled a certain gas before falling ill, with a very fragrant scent and a cooling sensation in the eyes. However, after contracting the disease, they felt quite uncomfortable, with tears streaming down their face..."

Based on this report witnessed by the reporter, it is probably not false, right? Therefore, the average reader will naturally be greatly puzzled: "Why is there tear gas on the streets?" A clever reporter wrote the answer, saying:

"It is possible that Jewish refugees, arriving here in large numbers, possess various specialties. Perhaps their medical professionals deliberately spread a chemical gas in the area as a means of livelihood."

Whether or not it was done by displaced Jewish people is not the primary concern. However, the phrase "it is possible" sounds like the tone of a Japanese military spokesman speaking to Western reporters. Unfortunate, or rather, Jewish refugees. If we follow our humble opinion, those with tear gas are unlikely to be Jewish refugees. Although Jewish refugees "possess various specialties," they are far less skilled in the art of killing than the world-renowned Japanese soldiers. It is a well-known fact that Japanese soldiers operating in various parts of China carry various types of poison gas. In order to carry out a certain conspiracy, the Japanese may well release poison gas in Shanghai and falsely accuse the Jews. Isn't that the truth? When the German Nazi Party began to expel Jews on a large scale at the end of last year, the fascist Japanese military, emulating the trend, also chanted the heretical theory that "Jews are all communists" and were anti-Semitic. So, who exactly is the culprit behind the "whiff of fragrance causing everyone to be in tears" in Shanghai this time? It's not hard to imagine. The Hong Kong Chinese Evening News had an Associated Press dispatch from Shanghai on the 25th saying:

"Local Japanese newspapers, such as the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, published an editorial yesterday for the first time expressing anti-Jewish sentiments, stating that 9,000 European Jewish refugees have arrived in Shanghai, and the Hongkou area will become a Jewish kingdom. Jews are known for their skill in trade, and the interests of the Japanese are feared to be harmed..."

If the news mentioned earlier is read in conjunction with this, the underlying mystery becomes even clearer. However, some Chinese newspapers, without thoroughly investigating the truth, actually published such strange news for the Japanese, which is no different from the Japanese fulfilling a propaganda role. Smart readers must open their eyes wide here.

### Forging

— Ding Di

We are in forging

Forging can increase people's mental and physical strength. We know that fish forget their hunger in the ice, and their eyes become blind. Deer develop their necks due to climbing trees for food. Boatmen who have experienced hardship and seen shocking waves and dangerous capsizes multiple times can handle them steadily. The difficulty of passage is often a good lesson in marine life.

A person needs forging to strive for growth and health. Forging is often storms, difficulties, worries, blows, practice, and labor. You don't have to be afraid or shrink back. For you, this is a good opportunity. You can take advantage of it to hone yourself. From some difficulties, from hardships, from impossibilities, from insults, you become another person. There is no difficult word in your dictionary, you see hardship as a delicacy, you turn the impossible into heat practice, and you smile at the enemy's head while sharpening your Wu hook.

Look, that is the field of a blacksmith. The stars twinkle in the darkness. Hammer blows are struck on the branded iron. On a large anvil in a workshop, red snake tongues and green flames erupt from the blazing fire, like flowers of light, singing passionately. Although it is a painful incentive and a relentless blow that makes it hurt, makes it sour, makes it resentful, and makes it weep, it does not shed tears, does not groan, does not shrink back, and does not cry. It stands up, endures tears and sadness, on the giant anvil, in the water tank, under the iron hammer. It is forged and tempered.

Cold becomes warm, black becomes red, brittle becomes flexible. After being tortured by external forces, the forged iron tastes hardship and becomes more lively, braver, and stronger.

We love to see sparks twinkle in the dark night. We love to hear the sharp sound of the hammer, making a loud noise. Light and light collide, force and force conflict. Light is passionate, and force is immense.

We must have light, we must have heat - we must forge. This is the test of survival, this is the threat of death, this is the bitter struggle, this is the herald of victory, this is the desperate revenge, this is the sweeping away of the last grain of stupid sand, this is the elegy of pain, this is the tempering of copper bones and iron muscles.

"The second storm of storms attacked and destroyed civilization madly. Violence, like an iron hand, pinched the heart of peace. The misfortune of the century makes us hurt, sour, resentful, and we weep, but we do not shed tears, do not groan, do not shrink back, and do not cry. We must use this hardship to hone ourselves. Many hardships make a country prosperous. We solemnly and strongly accept this gift—we come to forge."

We come to forge, for growth and health.

### The Bombing of Tuanfeng

— Sheng Dan

—War Zone Chronicle—

The gentle river wind at dawn caresses every soldier. "How pleasant!" everyone exclaimed. Soon, the sun unfolded its smiling face and sincerely kissed the mountain peaks on both banks, as if to say, "Friends, work harder, the light will always shine on you." That day, a group of nine of us left the embrace of Wuhan and went down the river to Tuanfeng on the north bank of the Yangtze River.

Tuanfeng is the main town of Huanggang County in Hubei Province. The towering Erzhou to the southeast crouch like lions, and the surging river roars constantly at their feet. It is said that this is where Liu Yu of the Jin Dynasty defeated Huan Xuan. In military terms, Huanggang covers Wuhan from above and controls Jiujiang from below, so the situation is very important. Therefore, Tuanfeng is their target for destruction and is constantly bombed desperately. Because we had to pass through Luotian to enter the mountains, we had to go through Tuanfeng, and we also had some temporary work, so we came here.

The boat docked. The town's air raid siren suddenly sounded. The people crowded on the riverbank immediately dispersed in all directions. The bustling morning market also disappeared under the urgent sound of the bell. "Damn it! Come on, the people of Tuanfeng are not afraid of death," curses echoed through the streets and alleys. Even the children's eyes burst into flames of anger. Indeed, the flames of national spirit spread with the bombing and continued to spread to every corner. Who says there is no certainty of victory?

The buzzing sound came from the sky. The whole town was as quiet as a lonely tomb, but the sound of footsteps on the street could still be heard faintly. This was the military police patrolling to prevent the discovery of "signals." As I turned the corner on the street, suddenly a hand was placed on my shoulder. "Ah, you are here. Will the military-civilian get-together be held on time tonight?" Fang Shizhang, who was stationed in Tuanfeng, appeared at the end of the street. This calm and normal attitude was of course due to long experience in battle. "Even if Tuanfeng is bombed into the ground, we will still hold it!..." Before he could finish speaking, seven bombers were already circling in the sky.

"There are five more!...Ah, they are splitting up!..." Someone was talking.

Boom—boom—

The sound of the exploding bombs continued like a mountain collapsing, and black smoke filled the surroundings. I don't know where a tree flew up and fell from the smoke onto the rushing beach. Tiles, bricks, and gravel flew everywhere like hail. Each time a bomb landed, a gust of wind rushed into the entrance of the air raid shelter. This continued for about three-quarters of an hour before it stopped. The rescue team and the fire brigade immediately set out and carried out the work they should do separately. But strangely, as a result of the bombing, apart from a yellow cow that died an unnatural death, Tuanfeng was still intact.

### Short-lived Gorgeous Flower

— Jun Bo

Should we say how much beauty a gorgeous flower adds to the world? Friend, you say, you have a clever head. Should these verdant branches be a symbol of the robustness of a short-lived gorgeous flower? Look at its arrogant appearance, stealing the brilliance of the sun and moon, borrowing a gentle breeze, and flaunting its arrogant coy smile. This is really embarrassing. Its coy smile steals the spirit of many small flowers. Friend, don't be moved, shut off your heart, don't pay attention to its charming manipulations.

Yes, you said it well, picking it is not considered a sin, cutting its roots and breaking its branches, to see how capable it is. Use the rough tip of the foot to dig up the home of earthworms.

Agile swallows are unwilling to use thin wefts to capture its branches. This is originally its own evil. Who is willing to lean their youth on it and tell the root feelings of their heart, unless a few ugly toads, resting their long necks on its lap, sing a hoarse tune, to win a little favor from it. Friend, don't just get angry, look at our arms. They are strong enough.

Who says it is really a good diamond, it is short-lived, and there will soon be a day of withering. Let us shout, shaking its heart, "Short-lived beautiful flower, bah? Be careful of your years!"

### On the Way Home (Part 2)

— Wang Li

In the town, there was a garrison of friendly troops. When I passed over the bridge, the sentry standing on the bridge looked at my documents again and again, and questioned me very carefully, before letting me pass. The houses in the town were filled with friendly troops. I searched for a long time before I borrowed a place to stay in a teahouse, and spent the night sleeping on two tea tables put together.

The next afternoon, I arrived at Lizhuang Bridge. Because the ship to Wujin had already left, I had to wait until 8 o'clock tomorrow before I could get on a ship, so I stopped here.

As I was passing the entrance of a teahouse, suddenly an unfamiliar person grabbed me from behind. I was startled and stunned for a moment, but the man smiled at me and pointed to the inside of the restaurant and said to me, "Their squad leader invites you!"

I became even more panicked.

When I looked into the restaurant, I saw the face of our reconnaissance squad leader smiling at me. So I happily stepped in.

"How did you get here too?" he asked me with a smile on his face first.

"How did you guys get here?" I asked back.

Afterwards, they told me about catching someone and showed me the documents they had found.

Because I was not feeling well and had walked a long distance, I was feeling a bit dizzy. So, I was preparing to find a place to sleep for a while, so a local comrade who had just joined our reconnaissance squad insisted on helping me open a room at a hotel.

The next morning at eight o'clock, I took the ship to Wujin. Because I was still feeling a bit dizzy, I used my luggage as a pillow and lay down.

When the ship arrived at a small village, a man wearing dark glasses got off. At that time, no one paid any attention to him. But when the ship was halfway there, which was the gap between the opposing forces, I was in a daze of reverie when I was suddenly awakened by a sound. When I looked back, the man wearing dark glasses was holding a Mauser pistol and darted out from behind the ship's cabin.

"Everyone be sensible."

He pointed his gun at us and shouted.

Everyone on the ship was stunned.

He began to search everyone with one hand, and quickly stuffed what he found into his pocket.

At this time, I was hiding a general anger, and prepared to give him a surprise when he searched me, knocking his gun away. I acted as if nothing was happening, closed my eyes slightly, and continued to lie on my side. But after searching for a while, he missed me and threatened the ship to dock and escaped.

Along the way, people on the ship were noisy, blaming each other.

At six o'clock in the evening, I stepped onto the land of another world. Feeling like I was walking into hell, I was walking on the brightly lit streets of Wujin.

I looked at the bustling compatriots, the puppet police standing on the streets, the dazzling neon lights, the dilapidated houses of burnt wood and broken bricks... I silently gritted my teeth and secretly shed tears of grief and anger!

Because I didn't have a good citizen certificate, I was rejected by all the hotels. Finally, a few old people pointed me to a secret inn, and asked a child to lead me there.

This was a semi-destroyed house repaired crudely with wooden planks in a pile of rubble. The inside was as dirty as a pigsty, with a few mats spread on the ground. Another room had two broken beds.

That night, I was very dizzy and tired, but I couldn't sleep with excitement. I kept my eyes open until dawn.

The next day, I escaped from getting a vaccination and took a boat to Wuxi, and changed boats to Suzhou in the afternoon.

Along the way, I looked out the ship's window, and the towns I passed had been half turned into scorched earth. Silently, I let the fire of hatred burn in my heart, and I also worried about my hometown.

——My hometown is probably already scorched earth, right?

I guessed sadly. But I immediately blamed myself for not thinking like this. So much of our land has been occupied, and tens of millions of compatriots have lost their lives, property, and freedom. I cannot selfishly hope that my hometown survives alone, and I cannot selfishly begrudge my hometown.

On the way to Suzhou, I was inspected five times. During the five inspections, I used all my strength to suppress my anger. The anger burned my dizzy head even dizzier, and my body was as weak as if I had a serious illness.

After spending a night in Suzhou, I took a ship to my hometown.

When I saw my hometown from afar, a chaotic emotion that was neither sad nor happy disturbed my mind.

Stepping on my homeland, I felt that my hometown, although not having experienced a major disaster, had changed under oppression.

After meeting my father and younger brother in surprise, my heart felt as light as a lead weight had been dropped. With the heart of seeing each other again in another life, we told each other everything about our love during this great calamity for more than a year.

After the excitement, my sick body became like a bow that had lost its string, slack and powerless! I stole a glance at my father's face, and my father looked much older in this year!

(The End)
