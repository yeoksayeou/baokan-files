### The International Significance of Spiritual Mobilization

— Qian Junrui

Spiritual mobilization is the core of political mobilization, and political mobilization is the starting point for the total mobilization of the entire people. Without political mobilization as a foundation, the mobilization of manpower and resources will not be solid or thorough. At the same time, if spiritual mobilization—political mobilization—is not followed by the total mobilization of manpower and resources of the entire people, then the so-called spiritual mobilization and political mobilization will be empty and illusory.

In the past, when Russia and Japan were at war, Tsarist Russia was aggressive externally but extremely corrupt internally. The Tsar did not transport ammunition to the troops, but instead supplied the soldiers with carts full of icons. As a result, the soldiers angrily said: "The Japanese are hitting us with ammunition, and we are hitting them with icons." This was also spiritual mobilization, but it was the spiritual mobilization of the aggressors, which is completely different from ours.

Now the German and Italian fascists are also carrying out spiritual mobilization. Hitler, in order to realize the "Third Reich" and dominate Europe, does not hesitate to use idols such as religious emperors, engaging in mystification; he tells the people to save bread for cannons and tighten their belts to be cannon fodder. The goal of Hitler's spiritual mobilization is that the Germans come first (see Article 4 of the National Socialist Party's policy outline), but in reality, big capitalists come first (the German masses also suffer); it is to drive out the Jews! (In reality, it is to drive out anti-fascist people!); it is to deprive the people of true electoral rights, political participation rights, and freedom of speech and publication! (Articles 6 and 23 of the policy outline); it is to stipulate that all working people must serve the capitalists (Article 10); it is Greater German nationalism! (Article 20)! It is that the whole country is militarized, and everyone should be cannon fodder for the financial oligarchy (Article 20)!

Mussolini has his own set of methods to carry out spiritual mobilization. In general, his spiritual mobilization has seven major goals: first, to eliminate provincial and municipal autonomy; second, to close all schools that do not use the Italian language; to prohibit the use of foreign languages; third, to change the unique surnames of the people; fourth, to absolutely prohibit associations; sixth, to have no freedom to publish newspapers: to prohibit any form of political life; seventh, to build a politics of terror and violence (see Count Corlo Sforza, "Ten Years of Fascism," American Foreign Affairs Magazine, issue 11).

Most interestingly, our × people are also carrying out spiritual mobilization. What the × people are suffering from most now is domestic unrest. The anti-war thinking and anti-war movements of the general public are the gravediggers of the Japanese warlords and fascists. Therefore, their spiritual mobilization mainly involves suppressing the people's thoughts and prohibiting the people's freedom of assembly and association; the tool for their mobilization is still Bushido. The consolation they give to soldiers is still Buddha statues and "thousand-stitch belts." Their so-called theory of "long-term construction" teaches the people to be slaves for a long time. They use the "Imperial Way spirit" to mobilize the people to be cannon fodder forever.

The above are all spiritual mobilizations of aggressors. Their real purpose is to seek spiritual desolation and the annihilation of the soul, and to allow the fascist minds to slaughter them at will. Everyone is like a mummy, listening to their arrangements and going to their deaths.

The spiritual mobilization of oppressed nations is completely different. It is anti-aggression, upward, active, and a spiritually inspiring mobilization. It is definitely not a regressive, passive, and shrunken "non-mobilization" of the spirit.

What is the banner of today's National Spiritual Mobilization of China? It is the Three Principles of the People, it is the "Three Principles of the People for which we strive, which are externally for independence, freedom, and equality, and internally for government of the people, by the people, and for the people—

Now, we are the main pillar of the world's anti-aggression efforts. Our spiritual mobilization should have all the characteristics of the world's anti-aggression vanguard:

First, it is to resist aggression to the end with arms and never compromise midway. Therefore, our spiritual mobilization has stipulated: "Military affairs come first, victory comes first!" It stipulates that "During this period, there should be no so-called personal gains or losses, personal interests, or personal humiliation or honor. Only seeking military victory is the glory shared by everyone in our country. Only failing to achieve victory is the greatest shame for everyone." Regarding this, we must first strike at Wang Jingwei and his ilk's advocacy and ideology of national betrayal and seeking peace.

Second, implement total mobilization of the entire people and complete the modern revolutionary war. Therefore, the mobilization program stipulates: "Modern warfare is a war of total mobilization of the entire people. Therefore, not only should all domestic materials and manpower be mobilized, but the spirit of the people throughout the country must also be mobilized." It stipulates "Concentrate the spirit of the people throughout the country on simple and common goals, so that the people throughout the country establish the same patriotic morality for themselves, firmly establish the same national construction belief for the country, and the people remember to struggle and sacrifice according to the same moral concept for the same belief." Regarding this, we must first oppose and restrain individual advocacy and actions of popular mobilization.

Third, implement the spirit of democracy and solidify unity and unification. Regarding democracy, the program stipulates "Popularization of the national political consciousness during wartime," "Accelerate the cultivation of true civil rights" (according to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's regulations, true civil rights are direct civil rights, that is, in addition to the right to vote, there are also the rights of initiative, referendum, and recall). It stipulates that we must "first seek the enrichment of the national spirit," "so that it is vigorous and radiant, firm, upright, and strong, and has the power to overcome the environment and resist difficulties." Regarding unity, the program stipulates "The nation comes first, the ethnicity comes first," and "Concentration of will, concentration of strength," stipulating "The joint efforts of all ethnic groups in the country to resist ×'s cause will further enhance the unity of the entire nation." We demand "the concentration of one spirit," that is, "seeking its close unity, with one heart and one mind, and a multitude of wills becoming a fortress, so as to achieve a state of absolute sharing of weal and woe and never being separated." Regarding this, we must first strike at all words and actions that sow discord and oppose democracy.

With these three things, our spiritual total mobilization will become an upward, active, and vibrant anti-aggression mobilization. This kind of mobilization is not only necessary for China's resistance against Japan today, but also necessary for peace-loving countries and nations around the world to resist the mad dogs of aggression.

### World Trends in a Week

— Fang Zheng

From June 4th to 10th of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939]

Due to the British government's continued attachment to the policy of compromise, and the stalling of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations on initiating an anti-aggression front, the aggressors have become even more frantic and active this week.

In the West, the two great aggressor demons, Germany and Italy, have been greatly stirring up trouble this week. From the Baltic Sea in the north to northern Africa in the south, and from Syria east of the Red Sea, the poison of the aggressors is flying everywhere.

In the East, the Japanese aggressors, in order to cover up their military failures in invading China, and in order to help deploy their political offensive, have adopted an even more shameless and tyrannical anti-British movement, provoking the Tianjin Incident and igniting the flames of war to drive out the forces of Britain, the United States, and France in the Far East.

Along with the severity of the international situation, the strength of our country's resistance war has made greater progress. In the Hunan-Hubei area, the advance of the × army was stopped. In southwestern Shanxi, the × people were dealt a major blow, and more than 10,000 × people were annihilated. In addition, good news has come from Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, and even southern China. Militarily, we are indeed increasingly approaching the stage of victory.

(1) The British Government Seeks Compromise, Germany, Italy, and × Light Fires Everywhere

We already pointed out last week that the ruling British financial capitalists continue to adopt a policy of compromise and retreat, and that this policy will inevitably deepen the crisis in Britain, France, and other democratic and peaceful countries. This week, the situation has become even more obvious.

On the afternoon of June 8, British Foreign Secretary Halifax delivered a foreign policy speech, clarifying the British government's foreign policy. The main point is still to seek compromise in order to reach a compromise with the aggressors. He said: "If the independence of all countries is respected by the international community, then Britain is not only willing to jointly review economic issues with Germany and other European countries, but is also extremely willing to do so." On the evening of the 9th, British Prime Minister Chamberlain also said: "Britain is still prepared to discuss the demands of Germany or any other country by means of a conference...cannot resort to force."

It's like saying to a robber who has already broken into your house: "...Don't use force!... Whatever you want, let's talk about it!" Do you think this has any possibility of stopping the robber?

Sure enough, the German and Italian aggressors saw through the British government's predicament, and in the past few days, they have intensified their frenzy! On June 11, Reuters Berlin reported that Germany was again carrying out military deployments on its eastern and western borders, building "defensive" works and especially equipping itself with new heavy military equipment. On the 10th, the Central News Agency reported from Budapest that German party and government officials were flocking to Hungary in an attempt to strengthen German-Hungarian relations. And on the 15th, Reuters New York reported that 250,000 German troops had concentrated in northern Slovakia along the Polish border! Germany's complete annexation of Czechoslovakia, Moravia, and Bohemia is about to become a reality. And the Italian aggressors are preparing for a major Atlantic exercise, attempting to carry out a major demonstration against Britain. They are lighting the flames of war everywhere like this!

(2) Japanese × Blockade Tianjin Concessions, Dangerous Storm Clouds over the Pacific

As for the Japanese aggressors, naturally, like Germany and Italy, they have intensified their attacks on Britain, one of the weakest links in the anti-aggression front.

From June 14th, the Japanese × implemented a blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, coercing the British and French authorities to accept their unscrupulous demands. The Japanese × accused the British side of (1) harboring anti-Japanese elements and communists, (2) supporting Chinese legal tender and hindering the circulation of United Reserve Bank counterfeit currency, (3) raising prices, (4) allowing the use of unregistered radios, and (5) allowing schools within the concessions to use anti-Japanese textbooks. The Japanese side declared: "If Britain does not change its policy and does not recognize the new situation in North China in order to cooperate with Japan in building a new order in East Asia, then Japan will not lift the blockade." And before and after the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, such atrocities as beating and killing British nationals, expanding anti-British propaganda, and intimidating the British ambassador to China with "buying assassins to carry out assassinations" are unimaginable to the general public!

The Japanese ×'s anti-British atrocities are in fact due to the serious difficulties encountered in the military invasion of China, and because the political offensive has failed to achieve much progress. Therefore, they want to use these atrocities to threaten Britain to abandon its anti-aggression policy and its policy of supporting China's resistance war, and instead negotiate a compromise with the Japanese × to oppress China into submission. If this attempt fails, the Japanese × also wants to use these atrocities to gradually plunder the rights and interests of Britain and France in China, drive out the forces of Britain and France in China, strengthen the rule of the occupied areas, resolve their current difficulties, and prepare for new offensives.

Therefore, we can assert that if the Japanese ×'s anti-British atrocities are not dealt a painful blow, then the bloody storms over the Pacific will ruthlessly strike! As our Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui said on the 14th: "Assuming that accepting Japan's demands can solve this kind of arbitrary violation of China and third countries, it is a mistake. These Far Eastern aggressors are now waiting for an opportunity to completely close the door of China and drive Western forces out of Asia. But if the powers can persist in this and all countries can take collective action to stop buying goods and all supplies, then Japan's speculation will eventually fail."

(3) The Policy of Compromise is Rejected Worldwide, the Peace Front Takes Another Step

Under the increasingly adventurous offensives of Japan, Germany, and Italy recently, the policy of compromise and retreat has been opposed by all peace-loving and just people. This tide of opposition has first risen among the British people, who have suffered the most damage. On the 10th, Reuters London reported that "The conciliatory tone used by Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax in their recent speeches has not only displeased the opposition, but has also made some people who support the government feel unhappy." Secondly, the French side is even more fiercely opposed to the revival of Britain's policy of compromise. The London Daily Telegraph's Paris correspondent reported that the French generally believe that "The German government still firmly believes that Britain is unwilling to fight. This fact and the speeches of Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax are the greatest crisis in the current serious political situation"!

On the one hand, opposing the policy of compromise, on the other hand, is promoting the movement of the anti-aggression peace front. Former British Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech to the Conservative Party on the 10th, saying: "Britain has now decided to organize a peace front...there is no turning back!" He also warned: "All non-aggressive countries, regardless of their political system, should be included in the peace front. Otherwise, it would be the most unwise move!... Although we do not like communist ideology, the Soviet Union is a non-aggressive country and does not advocate expanding its territory, and should not be rejected."

Since the Tianjin Incident, this movement to promote the joint resistance of Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, France, and other countries against aggressor countries has become more common in Britain and France. For example, at the British House of Lords meeting on the 12th, it was unanimously advocated that the government should take a tough stance against Japan, take joint steps with the United States and France, and strengthen assistance to China. And Britain maintains close contact with the United States and France on issues related to Britain, the United States, and France."

In fact, in the week since the Tianjin Incident, Britain, the United States, and France have been able to consistently oppose the atrocities of the Japanese ×. The military authorities of Britain and France stationed in the Far East have already set off for Singapore to hold a military conference. The large-scale exercise of the United States Pacific Fleet is continuing, and there is also news that the large-scale exercise of the Soviet Union's Pacific Navy is about to begin. Regarding the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, British special envoy Strang has arrived in Moscow and has had contacts with the Soviet foreign ministry. Although the new British plan has not changed much and is therefore still far from success, under the pressure of the international and domestic situation, the British government will eventually change its policy!

(4) Another Great Victory on the Northwest Front, No Need to Worry about the Situation in Hunan and Guangdong

In the week's resistance war against Japan, there were fierce battles in northern Hunan, Shandong, and southern Henan, but the focus was still in western and southern Shanxi. Since last week, the × bandits have concentrated their strength to advance the so-called sweeping war in the two provinces of Shanxi and Shandong. However, after our strong counterattack, not only did they fail to make any progress, but they also suffered heavy losses and were defeated. As in the southern Shanxi area, the × bandits divided their troops into nine routes from last week to carry out the eighth offensive in Zhongtiao Mountain, but they were caught in our clever mobile warfare plan. We began a counteroffensive on the 9th, captured Maojindu on the 10th, captured Pinglu on the 11th, and captured Daicheng on the 12th. In a few days, we killed more than 10,000 × ×, accounting for more than one-third of their total number. The number of beheadings set a new record for the results of battles in North China this year. In the western Shanxi area, the × had advanced in two routes from Zhongyang and Lishi, but the × army on the northern route did not make any progress, and the southern route was ambushed and counterattacked. We captured Liulin on the 10th and Tumen on the 11th, and once attacked Fencheng, killing at least 1,500 × in total! In Shandong, the × have been advancing in several routes towards Mengyin, Yishui, and Ju County since last week, and the momentum seems very fierce. However, our army used the mountainous terrain of Mount Tai to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the × bandits, and the number of beheadings was unprecedented in recent months. In the battle of Mengyin alone, more than 2,000 × were killed. Currently, the Shandong routes have re-entered [ ]. In addition, the situation in Hunan and Hubei continues to be stable, and the northwestern border of Guangdong is also very quiet. [ ] Jiang, Zengcheng, and Conghua have divided into three routes to attack Fuhe, Gonghe, and other places, but [ ]. In summary, the entire war situation is indeed increasingly approaching the stage of victory. There is news that the Japanese × army has launched another large-scale offensive, and northern Hunan and Chaozhou and Shantou are relatively tense, but in fact, there is not much to worry about. What we cannot fail to point out in particular is the actions of Wang Jingwei and others. Because the Japanese ×'s military invasion of China has reached serious difficulties, they have recently been actively carrying out political offensives, using military threats and intimidation against Britain as bait. The main focus of this political offensive is to divide the unity of our anti-Japanese front, undermine our country's cooperation with friendly countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, strengthen the rule of the occupied areas, and plunder our country's vast manpower and material resources in order to solve their difficulties. And all of this, Wang Jingwei and others and the "theories" and activities of the transformed Wang faction are directly and indirectly used by the Japanese ×. Therefore, after the National Government issued an arrest warrant for Wang Ming, we should intensify the struggle against Wang Ni's organization of a puppet central government and intensify the [ ] "rhetoric" of Wang Ni and other wavering elements and stubborn elements, making a ruthless struggle.

### The Great War Spreads to the Border Between Shanxi and Henan, The × Army Flees in Disarray on the North Bank of the Yellow River, More Than 30,000 × Are Wounded in the Battles of Hubei and Shanxi

[Special Telegram from Chongqing to this newspaper on the 17th] The total strength of the current × army in China is still 32 divisions, plus one division of Taiwanese soldiers and a portion of puppet soldiers. Its elite troops have been repeatedly lost, and some have been replenished more than ten times. The combat effectiveness is declining day by day, and it is trapped in difficulties on all battlefields. Furthermore, the nine divisions stationed in Manchukuo and the eight divisions in the country cannot be transferred. If this continues, it will inevitably lead to complete defeat. Therefore, it has recently used various means to try to end the war as soon as possible. But we will continue to strike at the × bandits based on the policy of resisting the war to the end. In the two battles of central Hubei and southwestern Shanxi, the × suffered a total of more than 32,000 casualties. Currently, the × bandits, except for harassing Shanxi and Shandong, are adopting a defensive posture.

[Special Telegram from Xi'an to this newspaper on the 17th] The battle in Zhongtiao Mountain in southern Shanxi is still fierce, and the × are continuing to reinforce their troops. The × seem to be attempting to concentrate all their strength and make a last-ditch effort. Our regular army and guerrillas in Shanxi are closely coordinated and have strong forces, and will surely crush the ×'s conspiracy. On both sides of the Zhang (Dian)-Mao (Jindu) highway, we annihilated the most ×.

[Central News Agency Telegram from Tongguan on the 16th] One regiment of the × artillery at Fenglingdu has been fiercely bombed by our army and air force for days, with more than half of them wounded or killed, and more than ten × cannons have been destroyed. In addition, 800 × trucks that departed from Yuncheng to Taiping and the buildings of the × in Yuncheng were completely destroyed by our air force. The × suffered extremely heavy losses.

[Central News Agency Telegram from Quwo on the 16th] The ×, six or seven hundred in Xia County, with two cannons, have been constantly attacking our positions since the 14th. On the morning of the 16th, they attacked eastward in two routes from Shangjiaping and [ ] Jia Yao. Our army moved west from Wangjiaping to meet the attack, and at the same time launched a flank attack from Fanjiacha, Wangjiaping, and other places. The fierce battle lasted all day, and the artillery fire was fierce. The × were attacked from both sides by us, suffering heavy casualties. In the evening, they fled along the original road, abandoning many military supplies.

[Central News Agency Telegram from Sian on the 13th] Military news. On the morning of the 13th, the × from Guwang, Zhangdian, and Taikuan attacked our line of Minjiagou and Dongchaicun in Guwang, carrying more than 30 cannons. The × launched four assaults, all of which were bravely repelled by us. More than a thousand × were killed on the entire line. The × then released a large amount of poison gas, especially in Guwang. In the afternoon, our Battalion Commander Wen Ying of the [ ] Division and all the officers and men of the battalion died heroically. As of the 14th, we were still continuing to fight fiercely east of Guwang.

[Central News Agency Telegram from Shanzhou on the 16th] A part of the ×, about 200 in Chongyi (southwest of Qinyang in northern Henan), fled west to the vicinity of Fancun at 8 a.m. on the 12th. Our army launched a head-on attack, bravely pursuing and killing them. After a fierce battle of three hours, more than 80 × were killed. The × bandits, unable to withstand the attack, fled to Chongyi in a panic. We captured many military supplies.

[Central News Agency Telegram from Xingji on the 16th] There is no change in the situation with the × in western Shanxi. More than 100 × in Fencheng, with two cannons attached, moved to Fenyang on the 11th. We ambushed a part of our troops on the highlands at the western end of Fenyang City, and another part of our troops attacked the rear of the × by [ ] × ×. After the × passed by, we launched a surprise attack, killing 34 ×. The rest fled back to Fenyang.

### In the First Half of This Month, Our Army's Battle Achievements Were 300 Battles, Annihilating More Than 10,000 ×, Sinking Eight × Ships, and Shooting Down Seven × Planes

### Eradicate × Goods from Entering, Chaozhou and Shantou Establish a Sealed Line, Strictly Inspect the Remaining Traffic Routes, He Chunfan and Hua Zhenzhong Jointly Issued a Proclamation

[Rapid News from the Mainland News Agency, Shantou] The provincial military authorities believe that unscrupulous merchants are smuggling × goods into the country, and efforts should be made to prevent and suppress them in order to maintain the national lifeline. Special orders were given to the administrative commissioners of each district to strictly stipulate the sealed lines in their respective areas and earnestly suppress them. He Chunfan, the administrative commissioner of the seventh district, received an order and yesterday, together with Hua Zhenzhong, the commander of the Chaozhou-Shantou Garrison Command, jointly issued a proclamation stipulating the traffic routes and sealed lines of Chaozhou and Shantou as follows:

(A) Traffic routes: 1. The line from Huanggang to Raoping; 2. The line from Dong[ ] to Chao'an; 3. The line from Shantou to Chenghai, Shantou to Jieyang, Shantou to Chao'an, and Shantou to Chaoyang; 4. The line from Qinghai to Huilai and Puning; 5. The line from Shenquan to Huilai and Puning.

### Probing Other Nations' Attitudes with the Tianjin Concession Incident; Attempting to Further Eliminate Foreigners' Rights and Interests in China; Both Sides Maintain a Strong Stance, Reaching a Stalemate

[Reuters, Tokyo, 17th] Following yesterday's cabinet meeting, the Japanese Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Army Minister, Navy Minister, and Finance Minister held another meeting. It is said that Japan's policy has been decided, considering that the Tianjin incident is not only related to the foreign concessions in that area but also involves Japan's fundamental policy toward foreign concessions in Shanghai, Gulangyu, and other places.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to Tianjin sources, although the Japanese side has canceled the demonstration, the situation in the British concession remains extremely serious. According to a British resident with status, all British residents, in view of the seriousness of the situation and deeply concerned that the Tianjin incident will become a test of Japan's success in politically and economically dominating North China, are united in dealing with it. An editorial in the Tianjin Times stated that the Tianjin incident can no longer be regarded as a local incident, so the first point is to acknowledge this point to deal with it effectively.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 17th] The British Consul-General in Tianjin has protested to the Japanese Consul-General about the interference with the transport of food into the British concession.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 17th] The Japanese military commander here stated that the British concession authorities have repeatedly sought to talk, but all have been rejected, because "according to the current development of the situation, such a meeting is not necessary." The commander continued, stating that the development of the current situation is entirely against the pro-Chiang policy of Britain, so it is no longer a local incident. If Britain does not abandon its current policy, the incident will be difficult to resolve. If an economic blockade is to be implemented against Japan, the joint participation of the United States is indispensable, which is a very problematic matter.

The Situation on the Third Day

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to Tianjin sources, yesterday was the third day of the Japanese blockade of the concessions. The blockade measures have become even stricter, especially for Chinese residents. Very few Chinese residents were allowed to enter or leave the concessions. The important events that occurred yesterday were approximately: (1) Two Chinese vendors were arrested and shot by the Japanese army for carrying vegetables to the concessions through obstacles set up by the Japanese army. (2) The activities of anti-British agitators have become more active.

Residents at the southern end of the former German concession suddenly heard several gunshots in the early morning, coming from the obstacles set up by the Japanese army. Later, it was learned that two vendors were shot and killed by the Japanese army for delivering vegetables to the British concession, causing great shock. According to the Japanese side, the shooting of the two was to "warn" others not to do the same. Yesterday, some anti-British agitators, because their attempt to incite the people to rush into the concession the day before failed, went to several laundries in the former German concession that specialized in serving foreigners, insulted the owners and workers, and threw clothes on the ground. Regarding the food situation in the concessions, yesterday there was no better sign. Although the number of vegetables sold in the market was more than the day before, the price was expensive and the quality was poor, and there was no room for choice when buying. A small number of cattle were transported into the concession yesterday, but it was still far from enough. British residents felt inconvenienced in the previous two days, so they decided not to leave the concession yesterday, so no events related to British residents occurred yesterday. The Japanese army did not seem to insult German and Italian residents. After the Japanese strengthened its blockade measures, it dealt a major blow to the Chinese people in the concessions, because most of those who wanted to enter and leave worked and made a living in the concessions. According to eyewitnesses, yesterday morning some workers wanted to enter the concession, but as a result, they were transported by Japanese military trucks to other places to work for the Japanese side.

The Situation on the Fourth Day

[Special Dispatch from Shanghai, 17th] According to Tianjin sources, the situation today remains in a stalemate. (1) A parade by pro-Japanese residents into the concession, originally one of the intimidating steps, has been automatically canceled today. (2) The supply of food and ice in the concession has become a serious problem. (3) The inspection of those entering and leaving the concession is extremely strict, and foreigners are particularly provoked and harassed, even the White Russians of the "Anti-Communist Association" are not exempt. (4) Two parts of the British concession were also blockaded starting today.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to Tianjin sources, the food situation in the concessions is deteriorating. The Japanese army patrols the river in front of the former German concession on motorboats, preventing people from transporting vegetables to the concessions. The Japanese side has also implemented strict inspections near the boundary of the concessions, so that various grains cannot be transported into the concessions. The temperature here has reached about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, but the Japanese army prohibits the transport of ice into the concession, which is extremely inconvenient for the residents. Also, although the British Consul-General made a strong protest to the Japanese side on the 15th, the Japanese army continued to rigorously search British residents. Reuters has learned that yesterday a British gentleman wanted to pass through the International Bridge to go to his office, but the Japanese army ordered him to stand at the end of the line waiting for inspection. The gentleman's ID was ineffective. When it came to his turn for inspection, the Japanese army ordered him to stand at the end of the line again, repeating this twice. Finally, a Chinese policeman suggested letting him go, but a Japanese sentry insisted that those who arrived later should pass before the gentleman was allowed to pass.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to Tianjin sources, members of the Tianjin White Russian Anti-Communist Committee were also thoroughly searched by the Japanese army today. Anyone entering or leaving the Special Area No. 1 was forced to take off all their clothes and obey the inspection, which was carried out entirely by the Japanese army. Even with credentials, the White Russians were not exempt from being searched.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to Tokyo sources, the Japanese army "reservists" and Japanese residents in Tianjin originally planned to hold a parade through the British concession today, but after the advice of the Japanese military authorities, they have canceled their original plan. The paraders planned to hold a memorial service today at the tomb of Japanese soldiers who died in the Boxer Rebellion.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 17th] The food supply in Tianjin has rapidly become a serious problem. The Japanese are now deploying patrol boats on the river, facing the former German concession occupied by Japan, with the aim of preventing all boats from transporting vegetables to the British and French concessions.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 17th] The Japanese side also implemented a strict blockade on the southern border of the British concession today, resulting in the cutoff of all traffic. The ban now includes ice, and the prohibition of ice transport is particularly serious in this hot weather.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 17th] The situation in the British concession remains calm today. It is reported that the Taikoo Dockyard Company sent a tugboat to Tanggu yesterday, carrying one passenger. The ship was inspected en route. According to a bank leader, commerce has completely stopped, with only some trading between banks and some foreign exchange transactions. Importers and exporters also say they have nothing to do all day. However, according to a stockbroker, the market has turned better due to the slight depreciation of the legal tender. It is generally believed that everything here has been suspended, preparing for war, with no signs of failure, but everyone is paying attention to how long it can last. According to very reliable sources, the Yokohama Specie Bank has notified German stores that if they can establish themselves outside the concession and provide written assurance that they will not transport goods into the concession, they are willing to conduct business with them. It is said that as of now, at least one company has agreed to this method.

### Shanghai's Pro-Japanese Authorities Also Provoke the Concessions; Tensions Run High on Great Western Road; British Troops and Puppet Police Face Each Other in a Standoff

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to sources in Shanghai, the British military authorities of the Public Concession reopened the police station belonging to the "Great Way Municipal Government" on Great Western Road, which had been closed three months ago. It was closed again by the British authorities that night. This morning, the "Great Way" police removed the power grid and seals. Upon hearing this, the British military authorities dispatched a large troop to Great Western Road to guard the area, and reinstalled the power grid. The "Great Way" police retreated into the Japanese-occupied area, with only a few police officers patrolling the border area. The British troops withdrew at 2:20 PM. The "Great Way" police then invaded Great Western Road, carrying rifles and handguns, but did not remove the iron nets installed by the British troops. At 4:10 PM, a large number of municipal police officers and a British troop rushed to Great Western Road again. It is said that the attitude of the "Great Way" police is quite sinister, and some neutral observers fear that the Japanese side will use this incident as an excuse to blockade Shanghai.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] According to Shanghai sources, the puppet city police station at the corner of Great Western Road and Columbia Road in the Shanghai Western Extra-Settlement Roads Area was closed by British troops on January 5th. On the evening of the 16th, several puppet city police officers moved into it. At 9:00 AM on the 17th, they were expelled by British troops again.

### Special Correspondent's Report: Luofu Travelogue (4)

— Firefly

Old Ashes · New Bloodstains

Changning, like Longhua, has a town of dozens of shops completely burned down, the only difference being the time. Changning was burned down by the Fascist "civilized fire" when Boluo fell last year. The scorched smell is not as strong as Longhua's.

We arrived at Changning and ate breakfast a few houses away from the charred street, to the north. Apart from two houses that still operated as tea houses, one served as the township office and two were full of soldiers.

If the face of Luofu Mountain is south-facing—the sunny side of Luofu is Changning. No, Changning is in the embrace of Luofu, closest to the beauty of the mountain. Looking behind the town, the true face of Luofu is revealed, with Chongxu Guan, Huashou Platform, and Huanglong Guan all visible.

During our meal, Japanese planes circled twice. All the soldiers and civilians were very calm, and not a single tea drinker in the tea house fled.

This was less of a breakfast and more of a lunch, because it was already 12 o'clock after the meal. We hurried along a small road to Futian, where we received the following military news: "The ×× Detachment retreated to Dazuo Tang via Jiu Tan last night. The ×× Battalion also arrived at Lan Shi." Some comrades were worried, thinking that there were no troops of ours on the front line, but five li from Futian, Commander Chen had sent several brothers to greet us and told us the location of the regimental headquarters, asking us to rest and stay at the regimental headquarters. He also told us about the bombing of Futian by Japanese planes just now. The brother pointed to the mountains and forests where the bombs had fallen, and his every word and action showed anger and vigilance. Then six soldiers, two civilians, and an armed comrade met us. They were the people injured by the invaders, covered in blood, with bloodstains all along the way. Here, blood seemed even more glorious and great.

Unable to refuse Commander Chen's kindness, we carried the comfort items to Lizhidun, distributed them to some comrades, and sent a few representatives to the regimental headquarters to meet Commander Chen. Commander Chen was a young military officer with a robust body and straightforward manner. He was Chen Bonan's nephew and could be called the son of a general. After a brief greeting, we decided to hold a meaningful military-civilian get-together in the evening.

### Military Report by He Yingqin at the Central Memorial Week Ceremony; Proving Victory in the War with Battle Statistics and Confirming Success in Development and Nation-Building

[Special Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Chongqing] The Central Party Headquarters held a weekly memorial ceremony on the 12th. Committee Member He Yingqin delivered a speech. The original text is as follows: Chairman, comrades, after the Battle of Nanchang, in order to continue to exhaust the enemy and prevent them from having any time to rest and reorganize, in April, the troops in each war zone continuously launched attacks on the enemy facing them. The guerrilla troops in various occupied areas also echoed the regular army, intensifying attacks, sabotage, and disturbances behind enemy lines, all of which were able to inflict decisive blows on the enemy. Especially the counterattacks in Nanchang, Gao'an, and Wuning, the counterattacks in the Guangdong-Guangxi-East River-North Jiang-West Jiang areas, and the surprise attacks in the Kaifeng and Anqing areas forced the enemy to run around, unable to cope, with elite troops destroyed and losses extremely high, and their westward advance was completely shattered by us. In total, the results of our army's battles in April, based only on written reports that can be statistically compiled, are as follows: (1) Number of battles: 827; (2) Enemy killed: 53,846; (3) Enemy and puppet soldiers captured: 1,068; (4) Horses captured: 774; (5) Rifles captured: 2,013; (6) Machine guns captured: 99; (7) Artillery pieces captured: 25; (8) Armored vehicles destroyed and captured: 171; (9) Ammunition captured: 68,934; (10) Enemy warships sunk or damaged: 11; (11) Enemy planes shot down: 12; (12) Kilometers of highways destroyed: 104; (13) Kilometers of railways destroyed: 90; (14) Towns and villages recovered: 3,787.

"The May Offensive" was the period during which the enemy planned to attack us, so the battles in each war zone in May were more intense than before. Especially in the Battle of Southern Henan and Northern Hubei, the enemy used three infantry divisions and one cavalry regiment, intending to find our main force in that area and destroy it in one fell swoop. They even broadcast and publicized this in advance, saying that several of our divisions had fallen into their encirclement and would be annihilated in a few days. Unexpectedly, they were met with fierce resistance from our army and suffered a head-on blow. Xinye, Tanghe, Zaoyang, and Suixian were successively recovered by us. Because the enemy was surrounded by us on all sides, they had to retreat hastily to Anlu, Jingshan, Zhongxiang, and the surrounding areas. In this battle, more than 10,000 enemies were killed, and many were captured.

The enemy corpses left on the battlefield and the wounded soldiers were piled up and could not be buried or rescued. The miserable situation they were in can be imagined. In total, the results of the battles on all fronts in this month are as follows: (1) Number of battles: 838; (2) Enemy killed: 51,891; (3) Enemy and puppet soldiers captured: 486; (4) Horses killed: 836; (5) Rifles captured: 1,587; (6) Machine guns captured: 183; (7) Artillery pieces captured: 13; (8) Armored vehicles destroyed and captured: 272; (9) Ammunition captured: 67,748; (10) Enemy warships sunk or damaged: 18; (11) Enemy planes shot down: 24; (12) Kilometers of highways destroyed: 107; Kilometers of railways destroyed: 36.

From the battle situation in these recent two months, we can see that (1) the enemy's attacking spirit has weakened compared to before; (2) if the enemy leaves the communication lines, both movement and supply become difficult; (3) the consumption of soldiers is too great, and replenishment is not easy (from July 7, 1937, to the first half of May of this year, the total number of enemy casualties was 864,500); (4) this invasion of China is without justification and is a protracted war with no success. The officers and soldiers' thoughts of war-weariness and anti-war sentiment are becoming more and more intense; (5) the war expenditure over the past two years has been too high, cash has been exhausted, public bonds cannot be digested, the economy is collapsing, and resources are scarce. The people in their country deeply feel the pain of living under pressure, and their thoughts of resisting the war are also becoming increasingly strong, and there have been repeated demonstrations of action. Based on these various reasons, we know that the enemy is probably feeling unable to cope with the current war. A quick battle and quick resolution is impossible, and a quick peace and quick resolution is also impossible. On the other hand, since the beginning of our country's war of resistance two years ago, the quality and quantity of the army have become stronger as we fight. After each battle, the army undergoes a reorganization, and everything from weapons, ammunition, equipment, grain, transportation, communication, and sanitation is enriched and improved according to the requirements of actual combat. In terms of education, in various military schools and temporary training classes, training is also intensified in order to cultivate a large number of sound cadres at all levels.

As for the issue of soldier replenishment, we are also thinking about ways to improve it day by day. In the existing military districts, in addition to the source of conscription quotas being continuously collected, many young men in various places voluntarily enlist early, which shows that the national concept of resisting the enemy and defending the country is increasing among the people, and the psychology of common hatred and resistance is deepening. This cannot but be attributed to the efforts and propaganda of the comrades of our party, as well as the efforts of all levels of government and national military service personnel, before such an effect can be achieved.

Since the beginning of the second phase of the war, our guerrilla forces in all directions have been able to exert their strength, frequently attacking behind the enemy lines and assisting the regular army in combat, so as to achieve the effects of dispersing, containing, disrupting, and exhausting the enemy. For several months, the enemy in Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan has felt deeply threatened and has assembled several divisions to try to wipe out our guerrilla forces, but the result has been a waste of military force with no gains, giving our army the opportunity to disperse and annihilate the enemy. In the future, as long as our regular army and guerrilla forces can effectively cooperate and coordinate their actions, constantly striking the enemy at any time and place, preventing them from achieving their goals of economic exploitation and plunder in our occupied areas, and as long as our party comrades and compatriots across the country can unite under the unified national policy of our party and government to work hard in production and construction, so that all wartime materials can be self-sufficient, gradually reaching the point where we do not have to rely on foreigners, then the longer the war lasts, the faster the enemy will collapse, and the day of the final victory of the war of resistance will be the day of the success of nation-building. At the opening of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee this year, the President once told us, "Our future will indeed inevitably have many difficulties, but after the War of Resistance enters the second phase, we are confident that the war situation will inevitably become more and more smooth day by day, and closer and closer to the light. The problem is whether we have an indomitable, long-term, and sustained spirit, and whether we have the efforts of the whole country to unite and fight harder." The President also said, "We believe that the work of resisting the war and building the country has no time limit. If it is not completed in five years, then ten years. If it is not completed in ten years, then a hundred years. We will not stop until the goal is achieved." Comrades, let us all follow the President's instructions and strive towards the bright path of victory and success.

Finally, there is one more point. Recently, enemy planes often fly to the rear for indiscriminate bombing, which shows that the enemy has no way to do anything on the front lines. On the one hand, they want to shake the hearts of the people in our rear, and on the other hand, they want to destroy our rear construction. But it is counterproductive. Under the enemy's policy of terror and massacre, our people across the country only strengthen their determination to avenge their shame and strengthen their determination to sacrifice for the country, and are not shaken in the slightest by the enemy's bombing, nor do they stop construction work because of the enemy's destruction. This is a great psychological progress of our compatriots across the country since the war of resistance, and it is beyond the enemy's expectations. We must always maintain this progress, resist the war to the end, and achieve the ultimate and greatest victory. (Central News Agency)

### British Protest, Japan Has Not Yet Replied, British Government Gazette Continues to Warn, Cabinet to Discuss Retaliation Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] The British Consul-General in Tianjin previously lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities regarding the Japanese army's search of British nationals and other incidents related to the blockade of the concession. No reply has yet been received from the Japanese side.

[Reuters, London, 16th] The British Cabinet will meet next Monday at Downing Street to consider the situation in Tianjin. It is reported that the various departments responsible for studying the issue will submit reports for review. The most important of these concerns what economic measures Britain should take if the blockade situation continues.

[Reuters, London, 16th] The British government has issued the following official statement regarding the Japanese military's blockade of the Tianjin concession: "The cause of the Tianjin incident was the shooting of a Chinese national in the British concession of Tianjin on April 9. Subsequently, the Japanese side demanded the extradition of four Chinese nationals they claimed were suspects. The British authorities maintained that they could not hand over the four Chinese nationals currently detained at the Municipal Council Police Station to the 'local court' without sufficient evidence being presented. However, the Japanese side resolutely refused to provide evidence. Later, the British authorities agreed to submit the case to an independent advisory committee composed of three reputable local figures and a neutral chairman for judgment. The Japanese side could send representatives to attend the committee, and the United States also agreed to appoint a representative to participate. The purpose of the above-mentioned committee was to determine whether the evidence presented was sufficient and constituted grounds for extradition. The British government had already prepared to accept any decision of the committee. However, the Japanese side acted unilaterally and blockaded the British and French concessions. Therefore, this proposal was not agreed to by the Japanese authorities in Tianjin. However, the British proposal to provide evidence to the advisory committee for a decision has not been withdrawn. At the same time, the Japanese authorities in China issued serious statements, making various excessive demands. The British, American, and French governments recently believed that it was necessary to lodge a protest with Tokyo regarding the remarks made by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on May 24, which seriously threatened foreign treaty rights in China. Later, a spokesperson in Tianjin issued a statement, the content of which was even more threatening than the remarks of the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson. From these statements, it is clear that the British refusal to extradite the four Chinese nationals was not the main reason for the Japanese side's adoption of opposing measures against the British concession. Their demand was actually: 'The British authorities should cooperate with Japan to build a new order in East Asia and abandon their pro-China policy, which includes no longer protecting anti-Japanese communists, no longer sacrificing counterfeit banknotes of the Prepared Bank to support Chinese legal tender, no longer cutting off goods, no longer tolerating illegal elements using wireless radio, and prohibiting the use of anti-Japanese textbooks in the concession.' The British side cannot but view this further extensive demand from Japan, which affects all countries enjoying treaty rights in China, as a most serious matter. The aim of the Japanese demand is obviously to force the British government and other countries with interests in the Far East to abandon their consistent past policies by violence. The British government still hopes that the Japanese authorities will not insist on their refusal to consider the British proposal, so that this incident is limited to localization. However, unfortunately, if the Japanese officials in North China insist on the new demands they have put forward, it will inevitably lead to an extremely serious situation, and the British government will also consider all the most direct and effective steps to protect British interests in China."

America Closely Watches, Gaida Scathingly Criticizes Japan

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Today, at a press briefing, U.S. Secretary of State Hull reported that foreign concessions in Tianjin have begun to feel the pain of the blockade. Hull released the contents of a report from U.S. Consul Caldwell, which stated that the concessions felt a severe lack of food such as milk and vegetables. Hull stated that he is currently awaiting detailed reports from the ambassadors to China and Japan in order to decide what additional measures should be taken beyond the attitude expressed by the chargé d'affaires in Japan, Norman, on Thursday. The State Department has also received a report from the U.S. Consul in Xiamen, stating that the Japanese side has also implemented a food blockade of the Gulangyu Public Concession. According to the consul, the situation is not yet serious due to sufficient storage, but it will inevitably become serious in the future. Caldwell reported that, as of now, the U.S. Consul in Tianjin has not received any reports of U.S. nationals encountering severe detentions or American goods being interfered with. A reporter immediately asked, based on the British announcement that the United States had agreed to appoint a representative to participate in the mediation committee in Tianjin, to which Hull replied that he had no particularly new information to report on the matter. Another reporter then urged Hull to pay attention to a sentence in the British statement, which stated that accepting the Japanese demands would be tantamount to abandoning the policies that the British Empire and other powers had insisted on in the Far East in the face of armed intimidation. Hull replied that the State Department was paying close attention to all the important developments in the overall situation but still needed to continue observing further developments in order to decide everything.

[Reuters, Rome, 16th] Italian official commentator Gaida issued a clear statement today, saying that some people in Italy regard the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concession as damaging the treaty rights of European powers in China and as a preliminary action to expel European interests from East Asia. Gaida wrote in 'Italian Newspaper' that "If the entire issue of the position of European powers in China arises as a result, Italy will come forward to compete with the powers for equal rights. When the Japanese authorities in Shanghai suggested reconsidering the Shanghai Public Concession in order to cope with the new situation, the Italian Consul-General in Shanghai had already explained Italy's principles in this regard."

### British House of Lords Debate, Expansion of Military Issue, British General Staff Headquarters, Currently in Talks With Friendly Nations

[Central News Agency, London, 15th] During a debate in the House of Lords this afternoon on the issue of military expansion, Liberal Party member Lord Stonehaven first spoke, saying that it was inappropriate for Britain and France to continue to supply the Axis powers with scrap iron and other metals. For now, British autonomous territories should reach an agreement to limit the export of various raw materials that could assist the German and Italian governments' military preparations. Labor Party member Lord Strabolgi also spoke, expressing dissatisfaction with the matter, and said that today's events in Asia were far more influential on world peace than events in Europe. The British government has now taken various measures and should work with French friends to deal with difficulties. Although it is late, it is not too late. Our General Staff should strengthen contact with the General Staffs of allied countries. Regarding the events occurring in Asia, we know that it is necessary to cooperate with possible allies. It is gratifying to read in the newspaper that a French naval delegation will travel to Singapore, and a British military delegation will also travel to French Indochina. Minister for Coordination of Defence Admiral Chatfield then gave a speech, concluding the debate, briefly stating that the relationship between the British and allied countries holding General Staff talks is important. This matter is currently underway and will continue to be pursued. The British military talks with various allied countries are after the military talks between Germany and Italy. The progress is naturally inferior to the German-Italian talks. Our expansion of armaments in peacetime is nothing more than to be prepared for war when it breaks out. This standard of armaments will soon be reached.

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] Minister for Coordination of Defence Chatfield said in a speech in the House of Lords yesterday that Britain's war plan is more thorough than ever before, especially in terms of air defense. The number of British fighter planes is gradually increasing, so that they can intercept enemy planes in the shortest possible time. For several years, the government will send experts to various places to inspect and study what necessary measures the authorities should take for air defense.

### British King Returns Home, Roosevelt Sends Telegram to Say Farewell

[Reuters, London, 16th] According to a report from the Reuters special correspondent on the 'Queen Mary', U.S. President Roosevelt recently sent a telegram to say farewell to the British King and Queen. The telegram reads as follows: "Your Majesties' visit to our country has given us great pleasure. As we part, I sincerely cannot but express our happiness again. Your Majesties have deeply received the warm welcome of the people throughout the United States. This is truly a natural expression of the American people, which is due to Your Majesties' benevolence. I am extremely pleased to think that Your Majesties feel the friendship of the American people. I wish you a comfortable journey." The 'Queen Mary' is now proceeding quickly in clear weather, but encountered a small fog this morning.

### After British and American Submarine Accidents, French Submarine Also Missing, Sunk During Exercise in Vietnamese Waters, French Navy Dispatched But Still Has Not Found

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] According to a telegram from Saigon, the French submarine 'Phoenix', carrying a crew of sixty, has not been seen to surface thirty hours after diving. Although there is no direct official news to confirm this, there is reason to believe that this news is reliable. It is expected that the Ministry of the Navy will issue a formal communique late at night. It is believed that the missing submarine was lost while patrolling the coast of Vietnam.

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] According to the latest news from Saigon, after the submarine 'Phoenix' failed to surface at the scheduled time, the commander of the French Far East Fleet immediately ordered all warships and seaplanes stationed at Vietnamese naval ports to conduct a search, but to no avail. It is believed that after the submarine went underwater, it lost its balance for some reason, causing it to sink to the bottom of the sea. The French Ministry of the Navy has just issued a communique, expressing concern about the fate of the 'Phoenix' submarine currently stationed in Vietnam. The communique stated, "The 'Phoenix' submarine has not been seen to resurface since diving into the water in Cam Ranh Bay on the morning of the 15th of this month. The French fleet in the Far East immediately began a search. The search is still in progress, and seaplanes are also participating. The headquarters has notified the families of the personnel on the 'Phoenix' submarine of this situation."

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] After the disappearance of the French submarine 'Phoenix', despite extensive searches, its location has still not been found. French President Lebrun is extremely concerned about this incident. He had originally planned to host the King of Morocco today, but has now temporarily canceled it. (Hong Kong News) At 3:00 AM yesterday morning, Hong Kong received a telegram from Vietnam stating that the French first-class submarine, the 'Phoenix', had sunk in the Cam Ranh Bay waters. It is reported that the ship and its sister ship, the 'Le Heros', belong to the French Far East Fleet and recently departed from the West with the destination of Hong Kong, expected to arrive within two weeks. The 'Phoenix' was conducting diving exercises along the way. On Thursday, it sailed to the Cam Ranh Bay waters of Vietnam, which is a world-renowned, beautiful, and deepest harbor, with a water depth of more than 300 feet. The ship sailed to the area and conducted diving exercises. Usually, the exercise time is two hours of diving before resurfacing. However, the ship somehow had an accident, and after 30 hours, it still had not resurfaced, nor had it sent a telegram report. It is generally believed that the ship has met with disaster. The sister ship, 'Le Heros', knew that an accident had occurred six hours after diving in the area and immediately searched for it, but without any news, it sent a telegram to report to all parties. French ships and seaplanes stationed in Vietnam immediately set off to investigate, but after a long period of search, the sinking location of the ship was still not discovered. The 'Phoenix' has a displacement of 12,384 tons and has four senior officers and fifty-nine soldiers on board. The captain is Mr. Bouchart, who is a famous figure in the French naval circles and has repeatedly made achievements. It is reported that the French Navy has a total of 30 such new-style submarines, with four of them stationed in the Far East, the 'Phoenix', 'Le Heros', 'Colossus'.

### German Ships Exercise, Damage Norwegian Fishing Nets, Will Demand Compensation

[Reuters, Oslo, 16th] It is reported that about 100 German ships were exercising off the Skagerrak in the North Sea, with aircraft participating. Norwegian fishermen said that many of their fishing nets were destroyed and have reported to the Norwegian government, saying that they will demand compensation.

### War Debt Dispute

America Asks Germany, Germany Refuses to Acknowledge

[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] A mixed commission organized by the United States ruled that Germany should compensate for a loss of $50 million during a time. A semi-official statement was released today, stating that "The German government finds it difficult to recognize this ruling." At the same time, German political figures also said, "This commission has no German representatives, and its judgment is obviously biased against Germany, so it does not conform to the procedures that should be adopted," expressing their resentment.

### Papal Representative Visits Polish Authorities, Conducts Mediation of German-Polish Disputes

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 17th] Papal representative Cortesi visited Polish Foreign Minister Beck yesterday and the day before, and this morning he again visited the Polish president. It is reported that Cortesi made a proposal to Beck, which was the Pope's response to Mussolini's request to continue mediation in order to peacefully resolve the German-Polish dispute.

### U.S. Senate Passes, Severe Penalties for Spies, Some Countries Send People to U.S., Sabotage U.S. Defense Plans

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] The Senate Naval Committee recently passed an anti-espionage bill, which stipulates that anyone who spies on U.S. military secrets in peacetime may be sentenced to imprisonment for five to twenty years. It is said that other countries (several of which are possible enemies of the United States) have now sent more spies to the United States to spy on U.S. military secrets, or even sabotage U.S. defense plans.

### Germany, Italy, Japan, Plan Merchant Shipping Cooperation

[Central News Agency, Rome, 19th] Relevant parties are now starting a plan to enable the merchant ships of Germany, Italy, and Japan to cooperate with each other. The method is for Germany to designate 75,000 tons of merchant ships to transport grain from the Black Sea and east of the Black Sea to Trieste. Italy will be responsible for transportation from Italy to Austria and Czechoslovakia. Japanese shipping companies will cooperate with Italian shipping companies to guarantee shipping between the Adriatic Sea and Japan and Northern Europe.

### British-Soviet Negotiations, Proceeding Smoothly, Talks Held Yesterday and the Day Before, No Joint Statement Yet Issued by Both Sides

[Central News Agency, Paris, 17th] A telegram from Moscow says that the British-Soviet negotiations are proceeding smoothly, with no reason for pessimism. As for the Far East issue, it is not within the scope of the negotiations.

[Reuters, Moscow, 16th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, British Foreign Office expert Strang, and the British and French ambassadors held a meeting at the Kremlin this afternoon lasting one hour and fifteen minutes. After the meeting, Strang and the British and French ambassadors met again at the British Embassy. Afterwards, according to Strang, further talks may be held on Saturday.

[Haito News Agency, Moscow, 16th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov received British envoy Strang and the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union at the Kremlin today. The meeting lasted for more than an hour. The results of the meeting were not released in an official statement. As far as is generally known, everything remains unchanged in terms of substance. It is reported that Molotov will do everything possible to urge the British and French ambassadors to provide further letters of understanding, and then the Soviet Foreign Minister can reply on behalf of the Soviet government and force the British and French to agree to the Soviet demands. It is heard that the main dispute is still the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic countries.

### Shantou City Under the Cloud of War

— Our Special Correspondent Bai Wei

The several blasts of the steam whistle carried the New Haimen Wheel away from Hong Kong, heading for Shantou.

Out of Lei Yue Mun, the waves of the sea surge endlessly, silvery snow-like waves burst out in one impact after another, and disappear in one descent after another. These are the waves of the Pacific Ocean, invisibly portraying the microcosm of this Pacific Ocean. We feel that although every wave crashes into our boat, affecting our boat to teeter uncertainly; but, as long as we are firm in our will and confidence, we will always break through the waves of the sea. Perhaps some waves are even the propulsive force of our boat. From sailing to experience the international situation on the Pacific Ocean, it is truly enough to make people optimistic about China's self-reliance in the war of resistance.

Around midnight, a great wind and rain arose. The roar of the wind夹着the sound of the rustling rain sounded like a horse neighing a machine, hitting the boat and making strange noises. The reporter silently calculated the voyage, which was probably already along the coast of the Dong River. The Dong River is the work area that the reporter is about to leave, and also the location of a perfect home. There, I have seen the bloodstains after the trampling of the x people, I have seen the cruel behavior of the x people, and I have even seen the heroic posture of thousands of loyal guerrilla fighters and the people struggling. The reporter hopes to see the winding coastline of the Dong River from the glass. But it was already covered by the black night, only arousing a trace of nostalgia and other hatreds. However, the safety of eastern Guangdong and the Dong River is related to fate; no, the entire China is also related to fate. Today, the concept of hometown and family should be broadly defined!

Departed from Hong Kong at 4:00 PM on the 11th and arrived in Shantou at 8:00 AM the next morning, a voyage of 16 hours. Originally, this route was declared by the × naval to be under ordinary blockade, but fortunately, this time, it did not suffer the inspection of the × ship harassment. Only when approaching the sea entrance of Shantou, in the hazy color, I saw about one or two shadows of warships, which are said to be × ships. In fact, with the extension of the Chinese sea , attempting to strictly blockade is simply a dream of the × naval, not to mention that in the current complex situation in the Far East, it also contains the question of international rights and interests? Look at the future results of this time × people blockading nine ports such as Zhejiang and Fujian, and you can make a few white facts.

Entering the harbor of Shantou, I looked at the sea surface. The entire eye is full of British ships. More than a dozen merchant ships of Taikoo, Java, and Jardine Matheson are lined up like a team. Next to them, there are also two or three small British gunboats. From this, it can be seen again that the interests of the British Far East shipping industry are in China. Chatting with the sailors on the ship, I learned that after the × I war broke out; cargo transportation has been reduced by half, and this time the blockade of nine ports is even more fragmented. At the same time, the bombs of the × people's aircraft, and the muzzles of the warships, did not turn their direction because of the British Empire flag logo, and still continued to be thrown towards (referring to the ships). In order to solve the misfortune of the British Far East shipping industry, I am afraid that it is not enough to escort with a few gunboats. We should fundamentally seek how to suppress aggression and stabilize the situation in the Far East. (To be continued)

### Five Hundred Thousand Letters of Condolence

Recently, the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, the Central Propaganda Department, the Central Social Department, the Chongqing Municipal Party Department, and the National Comforting Association have jointly launched a campaign to collect 500,000 comforting letters by June 30 and distribute them to the soldiers at the front. This is a very meaningful movement. On the one hand, it can encourage the soldiers at the front to produce more victories, and on the other hand, it can promote our general people's respect for the soldiers at the front and enhance our mood of supporting the long-term war of resistance and striving for final victory.

From the number of our vast rear area and overseas Chinese, the result of recruiting 500,000 comforting letters must exceed expectations. Even in this port, the number of compatriots is more than one million? Who is willing to be excluded from the heart of worrying about the national disaster? The act of comforting should be the first! What's more, it's just a matter of writing a stroke? The Life Bookstore is ordered to collect these letters on behalf of them. May all gentlemen and women not miss the last three days of opportunity!

### Congratulations on the Opening of the China Righteous School

The Hong Kong and Kowloon China Righteous Schools are scheduled to open at 1:00 PM today, with opening ceremonies held separately in each . We would like to express our national wishes to this.

The China Righteous School was established by the Guangdong Provincial Relief Association to relieve out-of-school refugee children and unemployed teachers. As the name suggests, we deeply hope that the gentlemen in charge will always and everywhere save the vitality of the Chinese nation and cultivate excellent new forces to prepare for the survival and independence of the country and nation in the future. Moreover, today, teachers and students get along in a hall, and since we are concerned about the suffering of these thousands of artillery fires, we should never forget the great shame and great hatred of our country's national dust. In the past, King Goujian of Yue led the people of Yue, gathered together for ten years, and taught for ten years, and finally flooded Wu. I hope you, gentlemen, will not be complacent, learn from the sages, and strive for the glory of the nation!

Furthermore, a total of more than 6,000 students are registered in the three districts of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macao this time, and the school buildings in Hong Kong and Kowloon can currently only accommodate more than 4,000 people. In addition, there are a considerable number of unemployed teachers who have not been hired. On the one hand, we hope that schools will generously help to lend school buildings, and on the other hand, we hope that those who are in charge of this work will continue to work hard and seriously select true talents.

### Roes Talk, Temporarily Does Not Answer to Any Agreement, Only Promotes Balkan Cooperation

[Haito News Agency, Athens, 16th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu held talks with Greek Prime Minister Metaxas yesterday.

### Standard Husband Test

Are you a standard husband?

Yesterday, we introduced the standard wife test to the ladies. Today, we introduce the standard husband test to the gentlemen. Sir, are you happy to be a standard husband? There are now ten questions: Please use the scoring table below to calculate your own score.

0 points... Absolutely not, never happened, don't do it

1 point... Occasionally, rarely, a little bit

2 points... So-so, not sure, sometimes

3 points... Often, a lot, mostly

4 points... Completely, absolutely

People's biases are the same, men are not much different from women.

Therefore, to ensure the accuracy of your standard, please calculate your own score first, and then ask your wife to calculate the score objectively. Then add the two together and divide by two. The result will be the true standard score.

47 points is a perfect score: Excellent, you are the most perfect standard husband. Generally, anything above 25 points is considered a good husband, but if it is below 20 points, then please pay attention.

Finally, let us mention in passing that we believe the family should be the joint responsibility of two people. If both parties can follow this standard and reach a mutually comparable level, then the family will always be a paradise.

The following are the ten test questions:

1. Do you have great ambitions in your career; do you read newspapers and books every day, striving to improve yourself?

2. Are you good at using professional and social opportunities to associate with many beneficial friends?

3. Do you pay attention to your appearance, always dressing neatly and cleanly?

4. Can you be patient, and when you encounter setbacks, not blame others and not lose your temper?

5. Do you completely entrust family affairs and finances to your wife to manage, only encouraging her from the side, without nitpicking interference?

6. Can you express goodwill towards your wife's family and friends, without criticism?

7. Are you not resentful, not melancholy, do not gamble, do not drink excessively, and do not spend excessive amounts of money?

8. Do you respect your wife's freedom, not insisting that she stay at home all day long?

9. In your spare time, do you always like to stay at home; if you go out, do you always try to bring your wife along?

10. Do you often like to invite guests to your home; but beforehand, do you always seek your wife's consent?

### Answer:

Yesterday's little puzzle of dividing the neutral zone for four puppies was extremely simple. According to the above method of division, the four puppies can each be safe and not infringe on each other.

### One Person a Day

Jin Shengtan

"Marginal Commentary Expert" Jin Shengtan, although talented, his fortune in the marketplace was not very prosperous. When he was young, he traveled tirelessly, rushing to take exams every year, but, alas, fate, fortune, he failed repeatedly. Once, he went to take the autumn exam again, the topic was "A Western Beauty." Old Jin thought that this topic was just right for him, and this time he was sure to pass the talent exam. He wrote quickly, composing ten thousand words. Who knew that after writing his great essay, his thoughts surged again, and he added a wonderful poem at the end of the essay, also circling it with a secret mark. The poem said:

"Going out the east gate, Western Beauty does not come;
Going out the south gate, Western Beauty does not come;
Going out the north gate, Western Beauty does not come;
Going out the west gate, will Western Beauty come! Will Western Beauty come!"

The chief examiner looked at the paper, the essay was not bad, but too deviant. He also wrote a poem in response, saying:

"To place it in the first rank, is unreasonable;
To place it in the second rank, is unreasonable;
To place it in the third rank, is unreasonable;
To place it in the fourth rank, a talent's fate, the talent departs."

### Rare News

King Carol of Romania has a nineteen-year-old son who graduated from a French middle school this spring. He was not born to the current Queen of Romania. Back in 1918, when Carol was still the Crown Prince, he privately engaged himself to the daughter of a soldier named Rabino. But a year later, the royal family did not recognize this marriage, and the court ruled it dissolved, with annual alimony of five thousand yuan. Less than five months after the divorce, this little prince was born. He was raised by his mother and is now named Prince Carol Mircea. Of course, this title is only recognized by his mother.

The Duchess of Windsor recently wrote a pair of letters to her close friend in London, saying: I have been away from England for so long, their—the people's—impression of me should have faded a little. Also, the British King and Queen have recently gotten closer to America, and Anglo-American relations seem to be very good. Do you think I can return to England soon?

### Weather Bureau

The weather today will probably not be bad; although the ancients said it well: "The sky has unpredictable winds and clouds, and man has fortune and misfortune overnight."

The night before yesterday, there was a big fight in Causeway Bay. According to newspaper descriptions, it was: "More than three hundred members of the Triad Society attacked Da Hang Village, with fierce momentum, beating people upon sight. The villagers united with more than a thousand people to fight back, and finally repelled the thugs." What a magnificent war "special," its grandeur, passion, and greatness are truly difficult to distinguish from the "Battle of Taierzhuang." But, what was it all for? It is said to be for "forcing children to join the society." Isn't that an astonishing thing?

Hong Kong prohibits smoking. No one would have thought there would be opium dens, but yesterday there were "four big hooligans impersonating police detectives, searching and robbing a new landfill opium den." Isn't this another strange thing? Robbers are getting more and more fierce, daring to impersonate police officers. Private opium dens,

### Anecdotes

It is said that one day, King Yama fell ill and sent two little devils to Yangjian (the world of the living) to find a doctor. Before they left, he repeatedly instructed them:

"The doctors in Yangjian are not necessarily all reliable. You only need to choose those who have fewer ghosts following them. Because if there are fewer ghosts following them, it means that they have killed fewer people, and their skills must be excellent."

The little devils obeyed and went, and after a long time, they brought back a doctor to report:

"There are many doctors in the world of the living, but there are also many ghosts following them. It was very difficult to find this famous doctor, who only had one ghost following him. So we brought him here."

King Yama looked at the doctor's back, and sure enough, there was only one ghost following him, so he asked:

"May I ask how long you have been practicing medicine?"

"I am of little talent and learning, and I have been practicing medicine for more than twenty years."

"Ah, you truly deserve to be called a famous doctor. You have only killed one person in more than twenty years."

"To be honest, great king, my fate has been unfortunate. Since I started practicing, this is only the second time someone has come to ask for my services!"

### Sea Adventures 6

— By Captain Lawton, Translated by Yang Bi

Previous summary

In 1914, when the European situation was tense, the American steamship "Kelongboqi" carried six million gold bars from New York to Germany. Qiu Kesi Company's radio operator Jack and mechanic Bill also took this ship to travel to Europe. On the ship, they met French aviator Lu Mengjialuo and the ship's German radio operator Bofu. While Jack was working for Daibao, he received a strange message saying that England and Germany had declared war, and a British warship was coming to intercept the ship. Jack accepted the captain's invitation and also became the ship's radio operator...

"Do you know? We are trying to escape the clutches of a British cruiser." Erlnanno spoke nervously and seriously.

"I knew it before the ship turned around." Jack said calmly, "But at that time, because it was top secret, I wouldn't even tell you; but now there's no need to hide it anymore." He told Bill what had just happened. Just as they were talking, a sailor came in.

He told them that the radio room door should be closed tightly, and the vents should also be covered so that no light could be seen from the outside. In the darkness, even the tiniest ray of light would let the British cruiser know their whereabouts. The passengers on the ship also received the same notice. The stewards were busy everywhere covering the vents with blankets. By ten o'clock, except for some working parts—where they carefully sealed the lights inside—there was no light at all on the entire ship.

Because they were afraid that some people would not obey orders, the captain ordered the circuit breakers for some of the cabin lights to be turned off. At this time, on the pitch-black deck, there were small groups of timid passengers huddled together, talking in low voices, constantly looking out at the sea, watching for any sea lights that might indicate danger.

In the darkness, the large ship did not use guiding lights, and with full power, it flew forward, breaking through the waves. The watchmen were more numerous than usual. On the bridge, the captain led a group of sailors, staying awake all night.

For such a long time, Jack sat in front of the radio, constantly listening until the second day at dawn, when a bit of sound came from the radio, breaking the silence. The British cruiser "Shasha" was talking to the "Suofuke," but the message was in code. Jack could only get the two ship names, but nothing else about the conversation.

At breakfast time, the passengers were all worried, sleepless, and haggard as they gathered in the restaurant. The captain said a few words to comfort them, but to little effect. Everyone knew that the ship was running wildly aimlessly, and the police dogs of the ocean were searching everywhere, waiting to capture this valuable prize.

Four icebergs

That night, there was a thick fog. But this could not reduce the ship's speed. Without lights, the deck and cabins were still pitch black. It was running at full speed, crashing aimlessly on the sea. The passengers felt even more uneasy. Later, they sent a representative to see the captain, requesting that the speed be reduced and that they not crash around in the darkness like this.

### Women's Basketball Championship - Zhi Xing Wins the Shen Bao Cup - Defeats Zhonghua 40 to 18 - Southwestern Team Slightly Edges Out Hua Xiong in the First Game

(Special report from this newspaper) The Shen Bao Cup Women's Basketball Championship took place last night at the Qingnian Hui Fitness Center. Many people attended, clearly showing the responsibility of those with money contributing money and those with strength contributing strength. It is difficult not to be grateful.

In the first game, Southwestern faced Hua Xiong. Both teams had faced setbacks in the past two games, with little hope for the championship. However, due to their similar strength, the competition was fierce. Southwestern won narrowly with a score of 27 to 21.

The second game was an important battle to decide the championship. The audience's focus was also gathered here. However, most people did not expect that Zhonghua would collapse and be defeated by Zhi Xing.

The reason for Zhonghua's defeat was poor defense, especially with no one able to stop Chen Rongtang's movements. Therefore, Rongtang got the ball almost every time, dodged past opponents, and scored more than 30 points with his own strength. It was truly a surprising feat.

After the start of the game, Zhi Xing immediately took the upper hand. Rongtang scored repeatedly, while the forwards of Zhonghua were blocked by Zhi Xing's defenders and made no progress. Later, Liu Shouguang was brought in to play, but it was of no avail. Because they had already lost too much in the first half, the morale of the team was greatly affected, and the overall situation collapsed. Even if they wanted to save it, they were powerless.

Zhi Xing's defense was effective, making it impossible for Zhonghua's forwards to perform under their control. Even with Shouguang's agility, they sighed that their skills were exhausted. Therefore, Zhi Xing's victory was due to their balanced offense and defense.

Throughout the entire game, Zhi Xing was in control. Rongtang was especially active. By the end of the first half, they had already won 25 to 5. Later, Zhonghua adjusted and had Rong Meikui defend, and the defense was slightly strengthened. Therefore, the forwards showed some improvement under fierce fighting. However, the losses in the first half were too great, and there was no way to turn the tide. In the end, they were defeated 18 to 40, and the Shen Bao Cup was won by Zhi Xing. The scores of both sides are as follows:

(Zhi Xing) Shots Free Throws Fouls Points

He Defang 3 0 2 6

Li Baozhen 2 0 0 4

### Chunfeng Appeals Case - The Federation Executes the Original Judgment - Also Accuses Chunfeng of Being Disloyal to the Federation - Many Players Suspended

The final of this year's Group B basketball tournament was the game between Chunfeng and Peiying on the 7th of this month. At the end of the game, Chunfeng won 29 to 28. Afterwards, it was discovered that the photograph of the Chunfeng player He Dizhang did not match the person playing. After inspection by the committee members on site, it was unanimously agreed that it was not He Dizhang himself. The Federation had resolved to cancel the two points that Chunfeng had won in that game and award them to Peiying. However, Chunfeng believed that the Federation's decision was unjust and submitted a letter of appeal to the Federation Committee yesterday [the 15th], stating that [1] He Dizhang, who played that night, was indeed the original He Dizhang who was registered, (2) if a replacement player was discovered, they should have been stopped immediately and not brought up after the end of the game, (3) the Federation's cancellation of their winning score was unjust, etc. After receiving the letter, the Federation held an emergency committee meeting at the Hong Kong News Reporters Association yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. After the meeting, the referees and recorders first announced what had happened that night, and then started the discussion. All the committee members expressed their opinions. After careful consideration, it was decided that the Federation had obtained sufficient evidence regarding Chunfeng's appeal case. They also obtained a handwritten statement from He Dizhang himself stating that he had not attended the Chunfeng vs. Peiying game on the 7th, showing that Chunfeng had indeed used someone else to impersonate He Dizhang to play the game. The evidence was conclusive, and it was believed that Chunfeng's actions were disloyal to the Federation. The committee members resolved to punish Chunfeng team captain Xu Zhouxing and person in charge Li Chongyi by suspending their eligibility to compete for one year from the date of the decision. Players Bi Yongzhao, Xu Dao, and Chen Shufen were suspended from competition for six months from the date of the decision. Furthermore, Chunfeng team's eligibility to compete in this year's competition was canceled, and the team's score in the Group B finals was completely canceled. In addition, the date for the awarding ceremony for the men's Group A and B and the Shen Bao Cup charity match, the date for the Guo Huo Cup, and the financial report, etc., were set for discussion at a committee meeting to be held at the Reporters Association at 7:00 PM on the [23rd] of this month.

### Public Baseball Game - Zhonghua Defeats Hong Kong Club Again - Two Games Held This Morning

Yesterday afternoon at 2:45 PM, in the Hong Kong Public Baseball League, the Zhonghua team defeated the Hong Kong Club again with a score of 10 to 2. The Hong Kong Club, deeply aware that the Yu Bei team, which was in high spirits for the battle against Japan tomorrow, changed its original formation in order to conserve energy. They had Smeth, who was used to playing second base, pitch, and Walker, who was good at catching, play right field. In the first two innings, Zhonghua took advantage of the opponent's weak pitcher and lax defense to easily score two points. The Hong Kong Club, unable to withstand the audience's ridicule, quickly called back Rowland to the important position of pitcher.

Yesterday, the Hong Kong Club was under great threat from the Zhonghua team throughout the game, and could only defend without any counterattack. In the second inning, the two points scored by Rowland and Kelly were entirely due to Higgins' triple. Unfortunately, it was a flash in the pan, and no one followed up, so they only scored two points.

The fourth inning was a lucky inning for Zhonghua. Chen Lianliang and Hu Guodong were dismissed one after another. If the Hong Kong Club had been stricter and nailed down the third batter, they could have disintegrated Zhonghua's attack. However, Zhonghua did not lose heart due to the adverse environment. Chen Fang first got a "single," and then stole two bases in a row. Cai Bingfen took advantage of Morton's missed catch to occupy first base. Chen Fen returned to the base in the chaos and scored first. After that, Qu Bingnan and Huang Rongjun each got a "double" and scored in succession. Chen Lunying and Hu Zhengqu were sent back to home base by Zhong Cansen's "double," scoring a total of six points. The strength of their momentum can be seen from this. Finally, when Hu Guodong came on, the ball he hit was intercepted by the second baseman, ending the dream. Yesterday, "Charlie" Lin Ye of the Jin Hua team was unable to play due to illness, otherwise the performance would have been even more impressive, and the score would not have been limited to this number.

The fifth, sixth, and seventh innings were uneventful, with nothing to commend. Zhonghua finally won a great victory with a score of 10 to 2.

### Gorky's Literary Legacy

— Jie Ru

—— Commemorating the Third Anniversary of Gorky's Death

June 18, 1936. A modern-day world literary giant fell from the skies over Moscow, that being Gorky, the most outstanding and thorough champion of the people's cause. After thousands of years of tireless literary and revolutionary struggles, amidst the rising of the new society he personally participated in and promoted, he passed away, departing from the masses who had fought alongside him for decades, leaving behind the literary successors he cultivated. He returned to his final rest. Today, this great literary giant has unknowingly been gone for a full three years.

The loss of a most courageous and powerful warrior, a most loyal and reliable friend, is undoubtedly a great loss for all the people of the world who are engaged in fierce struggles against darkness and violence. This loss can be said to be simply irreplaceable. However, everyone who has left behind positive contributions in the battles of history will not die in vain. They leave behind in this world an immeasurable wealth of endeavors, countless precious legacies, sufficient to extend their lives into the endless historical future. Gorky is such a person—and even greater and more glorious than many others who have left behind historical achievements. He created countless new literary achievements for our world and left behind many precious literary legacies. His decades of continuous literary struggle not only led the masses during his lifetime but also illuminates humanity in darkness with the most brilliant light after his death.

Gorky's literary legacy is exceptionally vast. Throughout his literary creation and literary struggle, there are the most extensive and multifaceted battles. He is not only a novelist but also a political commentator, theorist, essayist, poet, journalist, and editor. He is not only a realist but also a revolutionary romantic. His writing scope is incredibly complex, and the archetypes he depicts are incredibly rich. All of these are unattainable by many writers of the past and present who are mentioned in the same breath as Gorky. The bequeathing to us of these broad and multifaceted literary legacies can undoubtedly be considered one of the greatest glories of modern humanity. What methods and attitudes should we use to extract what things from his vast literary legacy?

Here, we can take a look at the Soviet "Literary News" memorial words to Gorky:

— Gorky's literature is an inexhaustible wealth of precious creative experience that our literature must absorb. Even after hundreds of years, writers will still have to learn various things from his works. Such as the mass appeal of his art, the accuracy, clarity, and conciseness of his language, the power to evoke genuine passions in the reader's heart, the keen ability to discern the internal structure of characters... all of these are worthy of our study. In any case, Gorky is a great school. He has already cultivated many great artists during his lifetime, and thereafter, even more writers will emerge from his guidance!

Of course, extracting Gorky's literary legacy requires starting from various aspects such as the mass appeal of his art, language, and talent. The words of Soviet "Literary News" are not wrong in this regard. However, such a view is inevitably incomplete and superficial. It cannot grasp the most central point. We know that within Gorky's vast literary legacy, there are countless aspects and countless characteristics. Grasping and extracting each aspect and each characteristic is necessary for us, but it is not central. We must certainly learn Gorky in every branch and node, but we cannot simply be satisfied with learning the branches and nodes. We must fully accept the legacy Gorky left us from the whole, from the unity. The so-called acceptance of literary legacy is not simply a technical question, but also a question of the entire literary creation method and artistic practice. Today, we must learn from Gorky, this great literary figure, how he connected his spiritual activities with real-world practices in the circumstances of his era, and learn his experience, skills, methods, and theories from the coordination of his creative activities with historical progress, so as to accumulate our own methods of artistic understanding. Only by understanding Gorky's literary legacy in this way from the whole can we organically extract and absorb everything from him.

Georgy Lukács, a new Soviet theorist, had a very good opinion on extracting Gorky's literary legacy. Although he did not clearly point out the basic central point of extracting Gorky's literary legacy, it is still a relatively concrete and clear opinion. He said:

— Learning from Gorky is by no means an easy task. It is much easier to imitate decadent artists or symbolist poets because learning from Gorky is not simply a literary issue (note: meaning literary technique – Jie Ru), the main thing is that we must learn from Gorky his attitude towards life. What does he like? Why does he like it? What does he hate? Why does he hate it? These are things we must know. How was his worldview formed? We must know this; The close relationship between the proletarian movement and proletarian humanism and realism, this must be known; In order to obtain beneficial lessons from his literary education, we must first know his highest education in life.

Accepting Gorky's vast literary legacy from the whole is the central task of our commemoration of Gorky today. This task not only has outstanding significance in the Soviet Union but also has extremely great significance in other countries in the world, especially in China, which is in the midst of battle. In order to create our national revolutionary literature, in order to more forcefully use our literary combat weapons, we all need to enrich and strengthen ourselves by accepting Gorky's legacy!

### An Interview in a Rural Village in Macheng

— Sheng Dan

—— Battleground Dispatches ——

Once you arrive on the battlefield, nothing can be predetermined. We originally wanted to stay overnight in Songbu and then visit General Li Zongren in Huangchuan to investigate the mobilization of the masses on the Henan-Hubei border. Because the war has entered the second stage, the struggle ahead is not positional warfare but mountain warfare; that is to say, strategically, we must shift to large-scale mobile warfare to achieve lasting and good results. The border area of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces is an important base for the mobile network; the winding Dabie Mountains, starting from Pingjing Pass to the east, extend all the way into Anhui, connecting with the Wan Mountains as if holding hands, while the Dahong Mountains surrounding the west, especially the northern Hubei main battlefield. However, after Councilor Chen's car was arranged, things changed again; the reason was that Miss Wu, a member of our group, suddenly received an urgent letter from an old classmate from Peking University in Wuchang, saying that General Feng Zhian was coming to Macheng soon, and part of the troops were awaiting orders to enter western Anhui, and the political training office needed help, so she could go and meet him.

"Then, let's go to Macheng first, okay?" Miss Wu sought everyone's agreement.

After considerable deliberation, a decision was finally made, and we climbed onto the truck under the intense heat of the sun. The road surface was very narrow and very rugged, so the bumping was particularly severe, and even the heart was a little shaken despite the short journey of dozens of miles.

Speaking of Macheng, you can't help but remember the past: this ancient city overlooking western Anhui was the base camp for attacking the "Red Zone" in the autumn of 1931. On the high ground outside the city, there are still many bunkers left. At that time, the central point of the "Red Zone" was established in Jinjiazhai, which has now been renamed Lihuang County and has taken on the important mission of mobile warfare. A torrent of iron from the Dabie Mountains will naturally overflow and roar, exerting its power in the same way as in the "Red Zone" era, if history can serve as a precedent.

After an hour's effort, the headquarters was found, but unfortunately, General Feng had not yet arrived, and the political training office was not here either. Coming with excitement, we were disappointed, so we temporarily changed our plan and visited nearby villages. With the introduction of the joint defense office, we successively visited seven villages.

"Why are we launching a war of self-defense?"

"To fight for independence, to fight for freedom, to fight for survival!"

"If our troops withdraw from Wuhan, what will you do?"

"Fight a mobile war."

"You don't have weapons, how can you fight?"

"Yes, yes, yes, they will send them! No, even plows and rakes can be used, as long as everyone is not afraid to die!"

This is a test of the people's awareness of resistance against Japan and at the same time, it is a latent great power. Their correct understanding, enthusiastic emotions, and strong unity cannot but amaze people and sincerely admire them.

"Who says victory does not belong to us?" Miss Wu's conclusion after the interview.

### From Chengdu to Xi'an

5. Ning Qiang Overnight

These two songs thoroughly and incisively criticize the road administration of Sichuan highways.

These days, technique is naturally out of the question, but they are all the heartfelt voices of the common people who have suffered from various folk hardships, accumulated over the years, condensed into strong emotions, and naturally expressed by the irrepressible release of these emotions. To us, who are also common people, they are quite interesting; even those in power should not ignore their cries. The author's intention in selecting and recording them lies here.

6: The Sleep of National Heroes

The troops heading to the front line that I saw on the way yesterday also arrived in Ning Qiang around 7 pm. They stayed in various hotels, and the Ning Kang Hotel where I stayed was also filled with people in the corridors. (To be continued)

### Gorky's Third Death Anniversary

— Wen Yu

"There is nothing in the world more ruthless than a clock: when you are born, when you are passionately gathering the flowers of your youthful dreams, it always swings evenly. After a person is born, it gets closer to death day by day, and when you are making dying groans, it still calmly and coldly calculates every second of your time." (The Clock - Gorky)

Curse this calm and cold time! It took away the great literary mentor, warrior, and soul of the oppressed, Gorky. He passed away, preventing him from seeing the battle of 500 million people, and not hearing the clanging and shattering of the chains of slavery; otherwise, he would certainly have fought solemnly and fiercely, fighting alongside us!

Three years! Today is June 18, 1939. Time is indeed calm and cold, however, what has passed should pass, and what is eternal will transcend time and be forever—that is, forever in Gorky's literary career, combat practice, and tireless labor. In front of these shining things, time is defeated!

Three years, in such a solemn era, on this day when fire and blood have reddened our motherland, we learn from the literary giant, the tireless warrior!

"Everyone is equally unfortunate, but the most unfortunate are those who use their misfortunes as ornaments. These people crave the attention of others more than anyone else, while at the same time, they are the least deserving of other people's attention. Struggle!! This is the purpose of life, let life have nothing but struggle—then time will be the most precious, the most beautiful." (The Clock - Gorky)

Misfortune. How common is that? Struggle, how beautiful is that? Those who go to the path of light, who proceed to the other shore of truth, will conquer time, conquer death! Gorky, forty years of literary life and revolutionary practice, he fought for the dawn of the people and the victory of truth. His struggle, his perseverance, is what the oppressed people, in today's battle, must learn.

Gorky is the singer of the common people, the call to battle. Ancient Russia was stabbed to death by his pen, the bourgeoisie trembled, and the revolutionary traitors finally poisoned him to death, but his achievement lies in learning, revolutionary practice, and being closely connected with all the oppressed people.

"Please read books—only knowledge has the power to save people under this dome of knowledge, only it can make us spiritually strong, loyal, and conscious people, and such people can loyally love humanity, respect his work, and wholeheartedly pay attention to the extremely beautiful results of his great work that will not cease." (How I Learned - Gorky)

How much does he value learning and reading good books? He has better learning in life. No wonder his knowledge is so broad, and no wonder the legacy he left behind is so rich. But we should see that his learning is for "loyally loving people" and for the "great work" of human liberation. To say it boldly, without Gorky's heroic and resolute revolutionary practice, there would be no revolutionary literature, and knowledge that is not closely linked to life is empty, and a life without struggle is dead silent. Therefore, to truly understand Gorky, we must understand his knowledge and the greatness of his literature from his struggle life and revolutionary practice. Separating Gorky's literary career from his revolutionary practice is an insult to this giant!

Gorky worked all his life to create the road to October, and when the revolutionary monument was already high, six-fifths of the land was still pitch black, so he continued to fight for the suffering humanity in the darkness! He was connected with all the oppressed people, and he waved the battle flag without any slackening.

He called out in this way at the Soviet Writers' Congress (1934), marching against fascism, in order to oppose "extracting profits, enslaving various small and weak nations, and turning them into slaves of Africa." (The same as the above quote can be found in the closing speech of the conference) — just because of his increasingly vigorous fighting as he grew older, he was poisoned to death by the disciples of the devil, and had to put down his battle flag, and this battle flag is to be supported by the writers of all oppressed nations and emerging classes! — It will not fall!

"Learning, revolutionary practice, and being closely connected with all the oppressed people": this is a summary of Gorky's life. However, this is summarized in this "struggle"! "Struggle—this is the purpose of life"!

We literary youth in battle are in battle! Holding the flag of liberation, raising the banner of anti-fascism, we should learn Gorky's struggle! Learn from life and books, participate in the practice of revolution, strive for the liberation of our own nation, and constantly strive for the liberation of all mankind! Gorky's image

Local News

### Hundreds of People in Tai Hang Village, Causeway Bay in a Nighttime Brawl; Triad Members Force Schoolchildren to Pay Membership Fees; Parents Ignore, Leading to Conflict; Seven or Eight People Injured in the Fight

Recently, there have been frequent reports of illegal organizations (commonly known as triads) in Hong Kong whose members harass people, forcibly recruit members, and extort money. While legitimate businessmen are not intimidated by these illegal organizations, schoolchildren, with their simple minds, weak knowledge, and minimal resistance, are often terrified and subject to their threats. However, some are not deceived and report the situation to their parents. For example, six schoolchildren from the Special Feng School on Tung Lo Wan Road reported to the sanitation bureau that they were being threatened by coolie Dai Jiu. This case was only resolved a few days ago, and last night, the 16th, a major brawl broke out in Tai Hang Village, Causeway Bay due to similar matters. One side had over a hundred people, and the other side had hundreds. The intensity of the battle and the violence of the situation were unprecedented in recent years. It is reported that a few triad members, including So-and-so, were threatening several children in the village and forcing them to join the gang, stating certain problems if they did not join, but the membership fees were too expensive and beyond their means. They informed their parents and asked for money, but their parents refused to give it to them. This matter had been brewing for many days. The triad members, having received no results for a long time, threatened the children again, saying that if they did not obey and hand over the money on time, they would resolve the matter with force. The children, being ignorant, were terrified and cried to their parents. The parents, some of whom were street vendors, some boat people, and some factory workers, were furious upon hearing the news and decided not to pay attention to them. If they really came to cause trouble, they would give them a head-on blow. Unexpectedly, the triad members, seeing that the children dared to disobey and refuse to pay, gathered about a hundred people around 10:30 pm last night, the 16th, armed with bamboo poles, knives, and iron rods, and menacingly threatened the children in Tai Hang Village. Seeing that the children's parents were intentionally obstructing their progress, they indiscriminately beat anyone they met and destroyed the market to vent their anger. Fortunately, the villagers of Tai Hang Village had received news in advance. As soon as they saw the enemy arrive, they sounded the alarm and reported to all the able-bodied men in the village. As a result, no fewer than three or four hundred people gathered in response, and a major fierce battle broke out. Swords and sticks clashed with each other, and the danger of the situation was indescribable. Those who did not have weapons engaged in hand-to-hand combat. As a result, the triad members, being outnumbered, knew they could not succeed and quickly sounded the signal to retreat. Five or six of them were injured and fled, and two villagers of Tai Hang Village were also injured and sent to the hospital for treatment afterwards. By the time the police arrived to suppress the situation, the triad members had scattered and disappeared without a trace.

### Six More Cases of Cholera, Totaling Ninety-Three Cases

There were six more cases of cholera this Thursday. According to current statistics, the number of cases of this disease this year has reached ninety-three. Other current diseases include three cases of measles, three cases of meningitis, four cases of dysentery, and twenty-eight cases of tuberculosis.

### Gloria Stuart to Arrive in Hong Kong with Her Husband

Famous Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart, along with her husband, famous screenwriter A. Sheemen, is touring the world. They arrived in Shanghai on the 12th of this month and will stay for about ten days before coming to Hong Kong. They will tour Hong Kong for a week and then go to Southeast Asia before returning to the United States.

### Thugs Impersonate Police Detectives to Search and Rob Opium Den; Cash, Opium Pipes, and Opium Paste Stolen; Opium Den Afraid to Report the Case

Police detectives, seeing that bandits are rampant, have ordered their officers in the Chinese and Western districts to strictly arrest bandits in order to maintain social order. Police detectives believe that bandits often hide in opium dens and red pill dens, so they requested instructions from the police detective authorities this week, issued search warrant orders, and sent large teams of detectives to search in Sham Shui Po, Ki Lung Street, Tai Nan Street, and the Sheung Wan area of Hong Kong. As a result, more than thirty opium dens were busted, and fifty or sixty suspects were arrested. After this news was released, a gang of hoodlums thought that opium dens and red pill dens were all established in violation of Hong Kong laws, so they gathered accomplices, thinking they had a chance to act. It is reported that in an opium den on the second floor of a building on a newly reclaimed land street in Mong Kok, around 4:00 pm on the 16th, four people suddenly went upstairs and knocked on the door, claiming to be police detectives ordered to search. The owner of the opium den thought they were real police detectives, so he opened the door to let them in. The thugs, seeing that their plan had succeeded, swarmed in, using the excuse of searching for firearms. They overturned boxes and chests and ordered everyone in the opium den to stand up for inspection. They stayed for about fifteen minutes, and as a result, they searched for and stole more than twenty yuan in cash, five opium pipes, and four taels of opium paste. After succeeding, they left. The opium den realized that they were only searching and not arresting people, which was not the action of police detectives, and began to suspect something was wrong. Because their own business was illegal and violated Hong Kong law, they were afraid to report the case, fearing punishment from the police detective authorities. Afraid to antagonize those who might harm them, they dared not report the case and could only endure it. However, police detectives, when searching a building, must have a Western detective in the same post, and hold an order from the police department (the so-called flower warrant paper), before they can carry out a search. In the future, if residents encounter this situation, they must first observe whether there is a Western detective accompanying them and whether they have an order from the police detective authorities before opening the door to let them in, otherwise the danger is great. If it is an illegitimate place of business, such as an opium den or a red pill den, if such a situation occurs, they must also report it to the police station, otherwise they will be suspected of condoning bandits. When both crimes are revealed, it is very bad.

### Middle-Aged Female Corpse Found in a Ditch on Chatham Road, Hung Hom; Suspected of Falling into the Ditch and Dying

Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 pm, a police officer on duty passed by about fifty feet above Chatham Road, Hung Hom, and caught sight of a female corpse, about thirty years old, wearing black cloth pants and a blue wicker shirt, in a ditch nearby. He immediately telegraphed back to the police station to report it, and the station sent detectives to investigate and dispatched a hearse to take the corpse to the morgue for examination. It was found that the deceased died from head injuries, and there was still five dollars in cash in her pocket, suggesting it was neither suicide nor murder. The police detective authorities suspect that the deceased fell into the ditch and died from injuries. They have taken a photo of the deceased and summoned her relatives to come and identify the body.

### Academic Relief Society Women's Study Group Announcement - A Letter to All Female Students in Hong Kong - Abandon Extravagant Habits and Earnestly Take Responsibility ×××××××××

The Hong Kong Student Relief Society has organized a Women's Study Group, and a formal establishment ceremony will be held today at 11:00 AM at the YMCA. Ms. Wang Xiaoying, a prominent figure in women's circles, has been invited to give a speech, and there will be various singing and drama performances to add to the festivities. The Society yesterday issued a letter to all female students in Hong Kong, and the original text is excerpted below:

Dear Female Students of Hong Kong:

The Chinese women's movement once flourished during the great era of the "May Fourth" Movement. At that time, women from all walks of life—especially female students with knowledge—voluntarily rose up to participate in all struggles, and passionately demanded and fought for freedom and equality for women in politics, economics, and education. In this struggle, they demonstrated unprecedented courage and determination. This shows that women had become a strong iron force in the "May Fourth" Movement. Therefore, in the great tide of the "May Fourth" Movement, thanks to the efforts of this group of advanced women, the initial foundation of the Chinese women's movement was started and laid. However, because their strength was weak and they did not persist in the struggle of the women's movement, the vigorous development of the Chinese women's movement gradually declined with the failure of the "May Fourth" Movement.

Chinese women have always been oppressed by the feudal system and bound by patriarchal society that have been left over for thousands of years. Therefore, the demand for their own liberation is more urgent for Chinese women than in any other country. This oppression directly affected and hindered the future of the Chinese women's liberation movement. Moreover, this oppression is national in nature and is suffered equally by both men and women. Therefore, women, who account for half of the country's population, must stand up and participate in the national liberation struggle as bravely and resolutely as men in order to strive for the thorough liberation of Chinese women.

Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese women's movement has made unprecedented progress. For example, the convening of the Lushan Women's Talks determined that the Women's Guidance Committee of the New Life Movement General Association would be the national general organization. Women leaders from all over the country, such as Soong Ching-ling, Soong Mei-ling, He Xiangning, and Shi Liang, etc., greatly led the women's movement. The heroic deeds of Zhao Laotai in Northeast China, the battlefield service groups of female students from all over the country, and the female student army in Guangxi, etc., all fully demonstrated the heroic posture of women in the War of Resistance. However, this kind of progress is still far from enough and the strength is still very weak. If we want to implement this general policy, we must unite more knowledgeable women, especially female students, to participate in the women's movement, play a model role in the women's movement, become the backbone of women, and become the vanguard of organizing and educating the vast masses of women. This is because students are the most outstanding and powerful group in the nation, and the student movement and the women's movement are equally important parts of the national liberation movement. Female students, who account for half of the students, have an inseparable and close relationship with both the women's movement and the student movement. Moreover, whether their organization and strength are sound or not directly affects the development prospects of the women's movement and the student movement. Precisely because of this, in order to develop the women's movement and support the women's movement, it is necessary to unite and organize the vast number of female students.

Students, in the past, female students in Hong Kong have always been scattered and disorganized. They are regarded as "Hong Kong Misses," who either live a romantic and extravagant life of pleasure all day long, or are trapped in feudal families. There is no talk of national liberation or women's liberation at all. Since the full-scale War of Resistance Against Japan began, a part of the students in Hong Kong have been awakened by the sacred sound of the cannons of the War of Resistance. The Hong Kong Student Relief Society was also established under the needs of the War of Resistance. As a result, a small number of female students also participated in student work under the leadership of teachers. However, because the Hong Kong student movement has no foundation, so far, the number of female students united under this Hong Kong student fortress is still very small, and the performance of their work is still far from the needs of ××. However, our female students occupy a very important position in the women's movement and the student movement. In the development process of the women's movement and the student movement, the lack of this group of female students with great strength is not satisfactory. Therefore, it is no longer permissible for us to continue delaying the broader task of uniting and organizing all female students in Hong Kong to support the student movement and develop the women's movement.

Students, the Women's Study Group of the Relief Society was established based on this need. So, what exactly is the Women's Study Group? We can simply explain it: (1) The basic task of the Women's Study Group is to unite all female students in Hong Kong, participate in collective life, increase anti-Japanese awareness, and at the same time, under our mutual encouragement and mutual research, give full play to our strength and serve the country and the nation. (2) The working method of the Women's Study Group is to adapt to Hong Kong's circumstances and use working methods that cater to the lives of female students and meet their demands to unite them. For example, on the one hand, we can often lead a collective life, and carry out interesting activities such as outings, sports, singing, and group games. On the other hand, we can carry out meaningful work such as reading, research, social services, and popular education. Furthermore, under the guidance of consultants and teachers, and with our mutual encouragement, we can complete our task of developing the women's movement and supporting the student movement.

Dear female students, today we must more clearly understand our position and strength in the entire nation, firmly grasp our tasks, and not underestimate ourselves in the slightest. We also hope that the Women's Study Group can continuously improve the past bad lives of female students under the support and supervision of the students, gradually consolidate itself, grow stronger, and truly take on the great task of ×××× and liberating women. Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation! Long live the liberation of Chinese women! Hong Kong Student Relief Society

### Detained in Guangzhou for Ten Days - The Foshan Steamer Released and Returned to Hong Kong - Yesterday's Temporary Sailing Carried Only Over Three Hundred Passengers - Guangzhou is Full of Bandits and Our Air Force Comes to Reconnoiter From Time to Time

The Foshan steamer sailed to Guangzhou on the sixth of this month. It was originally scheduled to return to Hong Kong on the eighth. It was unreasonably detained by the × party. After negotiations by the British Consulate, it was finally released, but it had been detained for more than ten days. The steamer moved to return to Hong Kong at 9:00 AM yesterday and arrived at 4:05 PM. There were only three hundred passengers. According to people on the steamer, the reason for this sudden and unreasonable detention is unknown. The details are recorded as follows:

Police Detectives Arrive to Maintain Order

After the Foshan steamer was detained by ×, people in Hong Kong were concerned. After receiving the news that the steamer had been released and returned to Hong Kong, many went to the pier to inquire. Therefore, around 3:00 PM yesterday, the area near the pier of the Guangzhou-Hong Kong-Macao Steamboat Company was extremely crowded with people waiting for the steamer. It is estimated that they were lined up from Sincere Company to the front of the New China Hotel, standing almost full, like a long snake, blocking traffic. The police station, fearing petty theft, sent a large team of Chinese and Western police detectives in patrol cars to maintain traffic order. At the same time, dozens of police officers checked the 20-yuan landing guarantee deposit for each person at the pier. They did not withdraw the team until the passengers boarded the ship. More than a dozen passengers were taken away to the prison camp because they did not have cash guarantees.

Unreasonably Detained, the Reason is Unknown

Yesterday, only 329 passengers came to Hong Kong on the steamer, including seven Westerners, which was a great reduction compared to the more than 1,000 passengers who returned to Hong Kong in the past. According to a senior staff member on the steamer, the steamer arrived in Guangzhou on the afternoon of the sixth and was scheduled to return to Hong Kong on the eighth. However, the next (seventh) day, it received a notice from the × party that the steamer was not allowed to sail. Under the power of ×, it had no choice but to obey the order to stop sailing. At the same time, passenger tickets that had already been booked were returned, totaling more than a thousand people. It was not until a few days ago that news of the release and departure was received, so a telegram was sent back to Hong Kong to report the whereabouts. So far, the reason for the detention is completely unknown. It is only known that it was released after the British Consulate lodged a protest. The return to Hong Kong today was a temporary movement, and no notice was issued in advance. Therefore, many of those who had booked tickets did not have time to attach them. The sudden reduction in passengers was really due to this reason.

Our Divine Eagle Team Flies to Guangzhou from Time to Time

Talking about the recent situation in Guangzhou, the crew member said that although Guangzhou is surrounded by a dark atmosphere and has not seen the light, gambling, drugs, and bandits are like ghost markets. The steamer stayed in Guangzhou for many days. The crew members, considering the rampant thieves, warned each other not to enter the city. They only hid on the ship, waiting for news of their return to Hong Kong. However, gunshots could be heard intermittently at night, and the situation was extremely terrifying. According to foreigners living on Shamian Island, our Divine Eagle team sometimes reconnoitered over Guangzhou, occasionally dropping bombs in the suburbs. The × people could not sleep or eat in peace. On the eighth of this month, twenty-two of our aircraft were discovered flying over the Guangzhou sky, high in the clouds, and the national emblem of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth could be seen vaguely. This time, no bombs were dropped, but the × in Guangzhou were disturbed. On the way back to Hong Kong, no trace of × warships was found. Only when sailing to Humen (the Bogue) were several × cargo ships found loading and unloading goods there.

### Next Year's King of England's Birthday to be Celebrated on June 13th

Yesterday morning, the Hong Kong Government Gazette announced that the birthday of the King of England next year will be celebrated on June 13th (a Thursday), and a military parade will be held. Last year's celebration was on September 9th, and this year it was on June 8th.

### Aircraft Carrier HMS Eagle Replaces Captain - Mr. Blagey Succeeds

Captain Inedy of the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle of the British China Fleet has served for two and a half years and has recently been transferred to another position. The vacancy has been filled by Mr. Blagey, appointed by the British Admiralty. Mr. Blagey is currently the principal of the Dartmouth Naval School. After being appointed, he set out for China last week to take office.

### Zhiyong Middle School Celebrates Graduating Students

The Hong Kong campus of Zhiyong Middle School has more than 170 graduates from the senior and junior high schools this year. The joint association of the first and second grades of the senior and junior high schools of the school, considering that the graduation of the students of each department is near, specially held a celebration meeting at the North River Theatre at 8:00 AM yesterday. More than a thousand people attended the meeting, which was presided over by Mr. Yongji. After performing the etiquette as usual, Principal Su Tairui and all the teachers of the school gave passionate speeches. Then, Mr. Dai Yue, the representative of the graduating students, gave a reply. Immediately afterwards, art performances were performed. After the meeting, all the staff and students of the school took a photo to commemorate the occasion.

### Boy Scout Swearing-in Ceremony at Pei Ying Branch School

The First Brigade of Boy Scouts at Pei Ying Branch School has spared no effort in training since its establishment last month, and its progress has been remarkable. There are quite a few who have joined later. After passing the examination by the Hong Kong Boy Scouts Association, a ceremony of completion of the intermediate level and enlistment of the primary level was held at the school's exchange field on Bonham Road yesterday (17th). Mr. Hou Li Hua, the Hong Kong Italian Army Chief Inspector, attended the swearing-in ceremony. The order was rich, especially the construction of the bridge by the Eleventh Brigade of Pei Ying, which was very agile. The performance of the savage bonfire party by the Fifteenth Brigade of Kowloon was lifelike, both solemn and humorous. Other musical performances and songs were also quite moving. During this period of the War of Resistance, it is a sign of hope for victory that the children in the rear can promote our martial spirit.

### Hong Kong Government Revises Dangerous Goods Ordinance

For the sake of safeguarding public safety, the Hong Kong authorities have prepared a draft amendment to the Dangerous Goods Ordinance of 1875, which stipulates strict management methods for the storage of petroleum.

### Guangdong Relief Committee Sponsors - China Charity School Opens Today - Unsuccessful Teachers May Be Assigned to Serve in Refugee Camps

The Guangdong Provincial Relief Committee, in order to provide relief to out-of-school refugees, has established China Charity Schools in the three districts of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau, and organized a Committee for the Relief of Out-of-School Refugee Children to be responsible for the management. Preparations have been completed to date, and the registration, classification, testing of out-of-school refugee children, and the recruitment of unemployed teachers have all been completed. There are more than 6,000 registered students in the three districts of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau, who are accommodated in various schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon. It is now scheduled to open classes at 1:00 PM today, and opening ceremonies will be held separately in each school to distribute books and allocate student seats. Classes will begin on Monday evening. The teaching hours for each charity school have also been scheduled, from 5:30 PM to 9:00 PM from Monday to Friday, from 1:00 PM to 4:30 PM on Saturday, and classes will be held in the morning and rest in the afternoon on Sunday. Regarding the school buildings, 110 rooms have been borrowed from Ying Shi and Jiu Liang, and 70 to 80 more rooms are needed to accommodate all the out-of-school refugee children. The association is still continuing to negotiate with various schools in Hong Kong and China to borrow rooms. Furthermore, regarding the more than 1,000 unemployed teachers, only over 100 have been selected by drawing lots. How to arrange for the others is still a problem. The Relief Committee raised the issue for discussion at a meeting held a few days ago. After discussion, it was decided to telegraph Chairman Li of the Provincial Relief Committee for instructions, but there has been no reply so far. Some committee members now have the opinion that many out-of-school refugee children live in various refugee camps in Hong Kong and China, and this opportunity can be used to seek the consent of unemployed teachers to be sent to serve in various refugee camps, to educate refugees in the camps. The living expenses will still be paid by the Education Committee in the same way as employed teachers. In this way, the unsuccessful teachers will be resettled, and the refugees can receive education during the difficult period. The association is currently considering this matter.

### Memories of "City of Five Rams"

— Xia Yan

The performance of "City of Five Rams" brought me into a world of memories, first, the distant thoughts of the friends who created this script, and second, the feelings of longing for Guangzhou under the fierce bombing of Japanese planes at this time last year.

Shanghai four years ago was a place worth remembering for the spoken drama movement. At that time, we had a small magazine that we could edit based on our own plans, and we consciously published a series of rough and immature scripts in this magazine, but more or less contributed some help to the national salvation movement at that time. At that time, the people who always gathered together to chat were Hong Shen, Zhang Geng, You Jing, Ling He, Zhang Min, and me. We always ate at the Oriental Hotel, where Mr. Hong Shen often lived, every ten days or half a month, talking freely, and the result was that scripts like "Descendants of Traitors," "Foreign White Sugar," and "Our Hometown," which has now been adapted into "City of Five Rams," were produced from this kind of chat.

The environment at the time was quite delicate, but these short plays were just adapted to the wildfire-like needs of drama troupes across the country. Before the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, "Descendants of Traitors" was the most performed script, but precisely because of this, we were attacked by people who "loved Bi Shu" more than they loved the country. The four words "collective creation" became our crime, and the condemnation has continued to this day - although we do not take this kind of condemnation seriously.

In this kind of chat gathering, Hong Shen always spoke the most and Zhang Min spoke the least. Once I became interested in the personality of an old man who was just alert to the old but had a strong sense of justice. Starting from this personality, we chatted out another script. Because the location in the play was in Beiping, and Zhang Min had lived in Beiping the longest, the responsibility of writing was pushed on him. Among the many scripts created at that time, I preferred this one, because no matter what, it was a more structurally complete attempt to characterize several characters in the play.

As soon as the War of Resistance Against Japan began, the friends who chatted together at that time scattered, but it can be answered with pride to those who condemned us at that time, that this group of people are still standing on the front lines of drama in an unyielding battle. Hong Shen and Ling He have met in Hankou, Changsha, and Guilin. When I arrived in Shanghai this time, You Jing still said nostalgically, "Now there is no such gathering where we can talk about everything from ancient to modern times." He misses Min as much as I do. The silent and tenacious man has written many excellent scripts in the past year and a half. I am sure that the constant bombing of Chongqing will provide him with many touching and heroic materials.

Now "Our Hometown" has been adapted into "City of Five Rams."

At this time last year, we were in Guangzhou under a month-long bombing. From May 27th to June 30th, the bombing did not stop for a single day, but June in Guangzhou was so lovely! At that time, it was the season for ginger flowers and lychees! Although I was threatened by blood and smoke, and the threat of death, I couldn't raise the thought of leaving Guangzhou. This love for Guangzhou is no different for me than for Wang Zuzhang in the play, although this charming city is not my "hometown." I can frankly confess that I love Guangzhou more than the West Lake in my "hometown," but after leaving her in the early morning of October 21st, which I will never forget, I can only be tormented by homesickness as deeply as that group of people in the play. The shadow tree flowers have withered, and now it is the time for guavas, right?

I believe that Guangzhou, which can be so dearly loved by me, a foreigner, must be loved and hated by the Cantonese people a hundred times more than us. The Cantonese compatriots, who are known for their bravery and love of their homeland, will not allow the shame of staining Guangzhou to congeal in their hearts.

Go and see "City of Five Rams." Don't forget "Our Hometown."

The day "Before Dawn" is performed.

### Unprecedented Grand Reunion of Hong Kong-Based Drama Actors: A Joint Charity Performance of "Before Dawn"

— Shi Liang

In order to promote unity and cooperation within the drama community, to contribute high-quality theatrical art in its current stage, and to raise funds for charitable causes supporting the cultural endeavors of our homeland, domestic drama practitioners based in Hong Kong have, in a short period of time, swiftly combined their individual strengths and gathered into a powerful torrent. On the nights of the 16th and 17th, an unprecedented "Joint Charity Performance by Hong Kong-Based Drama Actors" was held at the Lee Theatre. The playbill, "Before Dawn," comprised four of the most exquisite and outstanding representative dramatic works, all depicting the poignant and inspiring stories of struggle leading up to the imminent arrival of dawn. Now, relying on my observations, I briefly write down a few points, considering them as my personal reflections after the performance!

The groups participating in this joint charity performance were the three most renowned domestic theater troupes based in Hong Kong: the China Art Theater, the China Traveling Theater, and the China Salvation Theater. The directors were Ouyang Yuqian and Jin Shan. The cast members (listed in order of the number of strokes in their surnames) were: Wang Ying, Li Jingbo, Li Danlu, Jin Li, Jin Shan, Jiang Ming, Ke Gang, Tang Huaiqiu, Tang Ruoqing, Tang Ruoying, Fan Zheng, Sun Zhaoxin, Qin Xiaozhu, Zhang Li , Huang He, Tong Yi, Yang Wei, Deng Zhujun, Ge Xin, Ya Mei, Zi Ying, Su Hui, etc. All are outstanding drama actors with profound accomplishments and a long history of dedicated involvement in the dramatic arts. Unfortunately, in the past, due to their respective working environments, their efforts in the salvation drama movement have been separate endeavors. This collaboration—such close cooperation—is truly a "groundbreaking first"!

Considering its role in strengthening the unity movement within the drama community—both in Hong Kong and nationally—this joint charity performance should have its historical value. This performance fully demonstrated the power of collective effort. Through this strength, all obstacles were overcome. Everyone worked diligently, sweating and struggling to keep their sleepless eyes open, and ultimately, because it was a collective effort and a scientific division of labor, it achieved such a multiplier effect.

And among the members encompassed in this collective, there were the "China Salvation" troupe, about to go abroad for promotion, and the "China Traveling Theater," which had split up into separate divisions working independently after a division. Under the call to raise funds for domestic cultural undertakings and strengthen the unity movement within the drama community, the members of the "China Traveling," "China Art," and "China Salvation" troupes closely joined hands. This point alone is of great significance to these three troupes themselves!

The overall title of the plays performed was "Before Dawn," comprising four one-act plays. These plays are among the best existing one-act plays in China. Apart from "Dawn," most of them have been performed many times. Two of the four plays, "The Thief" and "The Street Performer," had previously been presented to Hong Kong audiences under the banner of "Protecting the Motherland." However, the previous public performance by "China Salvation" was packed every night. Who doesn't still regret those who were turned away due to sold-out tickets and returned home complaining? This regret now has a chance to be compensated. "The Street Performer," also known as "Fleeing to Hong Kong," and "Put Down Your Whip," holds the record for the most performances both before and after the War of Resistance. Perhaps most Hong Kong audiences have seen this play, but Jin Shan and Wang Ying's performances in it are "nationally renowned." In the war zones, hearing the "Shanghai Salvation Drama Second Troupe" perform "Put Down Your Whip, the frontline brothers would be ecstatic." In "The Street Performer," Jin Shan plays a decrepit old man and Wang Ying plays a delicate young woman, both with uncanny likeness and touching depth. Additionally, Hua Zheng, a thirteen-year-old child with remarkable achievements in children's work, delivers the opening passage of the story in the play with perfect timing. No wonder the entire drama community in China recognizes their acting skills as standardized!

"Dawn" is the recent work of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, leader of the "China Art" troupe. Mr. Ouyang, who has been consistently dedicated to the drama movement for thirty years, wrote and directed the play himself. Combined with the acting skills of Jiang Ming, Li Jingbo, Li Danxia, Yang Wei, Sun Zhaoxin, Zhang Lifang, Tong Yi, Lin Yamei, and Ge Xin, although it is a one-act play, it left a profound impression on my mind. Li Jingbo, in this performance, played a chauffeur who wants to contribute to the country and serve his homeland, while Jiang Ming played a stingy wealthy man who becomes upset and angry upon hearing about fundraising, but does not hesitate to spend thousands of dollars on personal extravagance. Both actors portrayed their characters with remarkable skill, eliciting both laughter and disdain from the audience. Additionally, there was Li Danxia's wife, Yang Wei's second wife, and Sun Zhaoxin's daughter, each excelling in their respective roles. This is a new work by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, a moving scene.

The director of "Redemption" is Mr. Jin Yan, who also served as the stage manager for the previous performances. Mr. Jin Shan directed the play—in fact, Mr. Jin Shan directed three of these four plays, and "Redemption" is the most recent one he completed.

Most remarkably, the "Tang Trio" appeared together on stage in a one-act play, something rarely seen in recent years. The script invested considerable effort in psychological portrayal, and the actors also achieved excellent results in this aspect. The entire play was lighthearted and lively, leaving you without a trace of fatigue.

"The Thief" is an adaptation by "China Salvation." Jin Shan, who played the old man in "The Street Performer," and Wang Ying, who played the village girl, completely "transformed" in this play. One became a fashionable young gentleman, and the other played a sophisticated lady. Watching these two plays, one could be dazzled, unable to imagine that a person's appearance, age, and personality could change so quickly. However, the cast list clearly states the facts, leaving you with no choice but to believe. The script is lighthearted, humorous, and inspiring, combining both. Their performance truly brought out the full potential of scathing satire!

The contents of this performance all depicted the poignant and inspiring stories of struggle before the arrival of dawn. Contemporary themes, actors with great reputations in the country...these factors made this performance, even if it cannot be said to be a presentation of the highest standards of Chinese drama, a rare achievement in drama.

And the greatest success was bringing the Hong Kong-based drama actors together on stage, allowing them to showcase their individual talents and skills, while also closely uniting them to strive for drama!

### Prelude to the "Five Rams City" Charity Performance by the China Traveling Theater: An Introduction to Several Important Cantonese-Speaking Actors

— Lin Zhi

It is truly gratifying that in Hong Kong, where the drama movement is actively expanding, so many "charity performances" are being held one after another. The most recent and prominent ones include the joint charity performance "Huanghuagang" by the entire Hong Kong drama community, the "Phoenix City" charity performance by the "China Traveling Theater," the charity performance by "China Salvation" before going abroad, and the joint charity performance by Hong Kong-based drama actors "Before Dawn" held the day before yesterday... Many performances held by schools and organizations have achieved excellent donation results and powerful publicity effects. This phenomenon not only demonstrates the fervent patriotism of many drama groups but also shows that "spoken drama" has gradually attracted the attention of people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and is about to reach a stage where it is universally accepted by the public. Isn't this an extremely gratifying state of affairs!

Since its reconstruction, the China Traveling Theater has strived to do everything possible and appropriate for the times. Therefore, its first demonstration of work was a purely voluntary performance of "Phoenix City" at the Queen's Theatre, meeting with people from all walks of life and receiving encouragement and support from audiences and friends in the cultural and artistic circles. However, that was only a demonstration of a portion of the "China Traveling Theater's" strength, because "China Traveling Theater" now has two equally capable teams. In order to adapt to the dialects of the audience in South China, the Cantonese team was organized from the day of "reconstruction." Now, they have been burying their heads in preparation for half a year, honing their skills and waiting for action.

Now, the Cantonese team of the China Traveling Theater will also dedicate its first performance to the country. Zhang Xuefeng, the director of "Phoenix City," the previous Mandarin performance, needs no further introduction.

What must be especially mentioned here is Miss Deng Zhujun, who plays Li Baozhen in the play. She is the most important female actor in the Cantonese team. Due to her skillful acting and sincere work attitude, many plays are starred by her. She is from Sanshui, Guangdong, and is twenty-two years old, healthy, lively, and bright, truly like the warmth of "spring" and the meteor of "water." She began her dramatic activities at the age of seventeen, guest-starring in many plays in various schools in Guangzhou, and co-founded the "Feng Society" with Zhang Xuefeng, publicly performing many national defense plays. Later, she worked in Macau and launched many school drama movements. She is familiar with "Our Hometown." When it was publicly performed in Guangzhou, Mr. Hong Shen appraised it, believing that her expressions and movements were skilled and had a special magic that attracted the audience. Now her acting skills are even more refined, and her rehearsals are more serious. It should be possible to achieve even further progress!

Zhang Ying's portrayal of Wang Zhongwen is very appropriate. And what is most commendable is Li Heng's portrayal of Wang Jinwen. He truly grasps the character's personality and emotions to the fullest extent, dissolving them into his skillful acting. His profound and natural performance fully demonstrates that he is a drama actor with great promise.

Xu Man's female servant has few scenes but excellent gags. Zhang Lun's coarse performance is strong enough. Liang Shan also works hard to play Liu Xiansheng. Others such as Liao Zhaoxing and Zhang Yufeng also have appropriate performances.

There are also two very noteworthy Mandarin actors who take on two very important roles, because they are all Cantonese, so they can competently fulfill them!! One is Liao Fan, who plays Wang Zuzhang, depicting this unyielding old man sternly, surpassing all the plays he has played before, with insightful understanding and performance. The other is Huang He, who plays Yin Jiaming, acting as a villain with understanding and causing hatred among comrades during rehearsals.

In addition, Tang Huaiqiu from the Mandarin team plays a clerk in the play, and Zhao Shuo and others also go on stage to play minor roles, partly to express the spirit of cooperation of the "China Traveling Theater" and partly to increase the audience's interest.

Generally speaking, the "roundness" and "fineness" of the "Five Rams City" performance should surpass "Phoenix City." Wish them to work harder!

When the Student Self-Government Association of Lingnan University decided to hold a charity performance to raise funds for wounded soldiers and refugees and invited the "China Traveling Theater" to perform, the China Traveling Theater immediately agreed to repay the society with a Cantonese performance of "Five Rams City." It has now been decided that it will be held at the Queen's Theatre at 9 p.m. on the 22nd of this month. The nature and methods are roughly the same as the previous charity performance of "Phoenix City."

"Five Rams City" is a play that the "China Traveling Theater" has been preparing for several months. The script is adapted from "Our Hometown." Under the meticulous direction of Zhang Xuefeng, the entire play has developed extremely smoothly and vividly. It can be said to be delicate and vivid. Now I will specifically introduce my observations of their rehearsals and the most important actors in it, which may also be something that comrades who love drama are happy to know.

First of all, it is necessary to mention Zhang Xuefeng, who bears the responsibility of directing, stage design, and stage equipment, and also plays an old servant in the play. His abilities are multifaceted, and he is able to do everything himself. In addition to being responsible for the Cantonese team, he is in charge of all the stage decorations for the entire team. He participates in the rehearsal work of many school groups, meticulous and considerate, hardworking and dedicated.

### We Need Dawn

— Huang Hua

As long as we "realize that what is right now is right and what was wrong yesterday was wrong" and act accordingly, no matter how darkness and hardship fill the period before dawn, no matter how much suffering and cruelty there is, the dawn will eventually arrive.

The joint grand performance of "Before Dawn" by Hong Kong-based drama actors in the past two days is a sharp and essential satire of reality, exposing the present state of affairs before dawn and at the moment of the impending dawn. It portrays the contradictory phenomena in society before the light and inspires a unified resonance among compatriots from all walks of life. Whether they are thieves, corrupt officials, charming young men, wanderers, children, or old men... when they awaken, they all shout loudly! "We need dawn!"

Dawn—is a symbol of joy, liveliness, freedom, equality, and liberation. Dawn will illuminate our common goal of "Resisting the war will surely win, and nation-building will surely succeed." It is the torch of the greatest and brightest truth, the gospel of the Chinese nation.

This performance truly grasped and touched the hearts of countless audiences, tightly gripping the hearts of every patriotic Chinese son and daughter with its tragic, painful, and passionate actions, bringing the old and new sorrows of the country and family together before their eyes. Just the scene of "The Street Performer" alone made people unable to hold back tears of sympathy, followed by excited shouts. If we were to describe this performance in two sentences, we could really say that "the tragedy is tragic to the extreme, and the excitement is also excited to the extreme," especially for those of us who have fled to Hong Kong and have "the same feelings." We feel even more that the responsibilities we have fulfilled in the past are not enough and that we need "redemption."

The actors' earnest dedication and rigorous attitude are truly awe-inspiring. This point alone is already very difficult and worthy of praise.

This joint performance undoubtedly strengthened the united front of the local drama movement in Hong Kong and has shown unprecedented progress and unprecedented unity. We further hope to maintain and continuously strengthen this power.

We need the dawn of resisting war and building the nation, and we also need to reach the dawn of the united front of the drama community in Hong Kong.

Comrades, put your strength out, the dawn is in front of us!

### Theoretical Research on the Historical Drama "Liang Hongyu"

— Liu Danqing

The collective creation of "The Battle of Taierzhuang" by the China Salvation Drama Troupe was performed in Hong Kong, causing a sensation and unprecedentedly expanding the sensory effect and scope of drama. The script has been published by Life Bookstore as the first type of the troupe's books. The previous issue of this magazine already introduced it. Now, the second type of the troupe's series, the four-act historical drama "Liang Hongyu" (also known as "Huang Tiandang"), written by Liu Danqing of the troupe, will be published soon. This article is the theoretical basis of the play by Liu Jun, which is published here first. - Editor

The preparatory work for the China Salvation Drama Troupe's overseas publicity is multifaceted, and the preparation of the script is one of them. In addition to the already performed "The Battle of Taierzhuang" and other existing scripts, Mr. Hong Shen and Mr. Xia Yan have both promised to provide us with the latest works, but in order to adapt to the special circumstances and special requirements of certain places overseas, we plan to prepare some historical dramas for indirect publicity.

Among many historical stories of national heroes, we selected Yue Fei and Liang Hongyu. However, some gentlemen provided the opinion that tragedies are inevitable, and Yue Fei's tragic ending is inevitable, which is not in line with the current anti-war situation. We accepted this opinion, so we focused our attention on the issue of Liang Hongyu.

Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's opera "Liang Hongyu" is a good script in terms of both form and content. However, there are two preconditions for us to rewrite the historical drama "Liang Hongyu" in the form of spoken drama: First, we do not have many skills that can be used in Chinese opera, and we must use other things to make up for this shortcoming; Second, we do not want to use history as an old bottle to fill with new wine, calling it the Song Dynasty, to say modern things, because historical development has its own laws, and there are also different environments and styles to match, but they can explain each other. So, what is our basis? It is realism, historical realism, a historical, realistic character, tools, life, habits and style.

Reading the History of the Song Dynasty and studying the history of the Song-Jin War inevitably raises two questions: Why did the Jin win and why did the Song lose? Did the Song have enough strength to repel the enemy?

Regarding the first question, from the current point of view, it is a bit strange. In terms of soldiers, weapons, financial resources, and land, the Jin was not in an advantageous position, and the Song was not a weak country in a disadvantageous position, but the Song eventually took a backseat and suffered defeats. This is the fallacy of weapon theory. From another point of view, Jin was a backward small country, but it was able to grow stronger in the war. Although the Song was an advanced big country, it was weakened in concession. This proves that the national strength of the warring parties can be strengthened. The key to the change lies in the overall strategy and tactics. In the Song Dynasty court, loyalty and treachery were unclear, rewards and punishments were uncertain, and war and peace were undecided. The court lost the people's hearts and failed to rally the troops. The command of the pro-war factions was inconsistent, and the pro-peace factions were willing to compromise. The court did not reward the military and civilians who bravely killed the enemy, and did not investigate the traitors who surrendered to the enemy. It is no wonder that they were completely defeated.

The second question, did the Song have enough strength to repel the enemies? It can be said with certainty that it did. Before the Song moved its capital to the south, it never had a major decisive battle with the enemy. The four directions still had the troops of the various princes, and the southeast had ample wealth. In terms of generals, there were Li Gang, Zong Ze, Zhao Shidao, Yue Fei, and Han Shizhong. In terms of morale, there were Chen Dong, Xu Kui, and Ouyang Che. In terms of popular support, although the two rivers were lost, what the Jin guarded were only a few cities. The rest were mostly in the hands of the military and civilians who supported the Song Dynasty, thinking about the court sending troops to recover the lost land. Unfortunately, Emperors Huizong, Qinzong, and Gaozong and the likes of Li Bangyan, Huang Qianshan, Wang Boyan, and Qin Hui consistently suffered from fear of Jin and did not trust the strength of the country's military and civilians, and could not be at peace in their secure positions.

As the saying goes, raising a tiger leaves trouble. Jin, this evil tiger, was raised by the Song. Jin was originally a backward small country, but because it was able to concentrate power and make better use of human and financial resources, it gained ground and annexed the two rivers and two capitals, invaded the two lakes and two huai, seized the two emperors, and pursued Gaozong in Dinghai. From this, it can be seen that strong neighbors will never be satisfied. The atrocities of the Jin soldiers were even more difficult to describe. In the Pingjiang area alone, the Jin soldiers burned and looted, killing 500,000 people.

On the one hand, there were traitors who colluded with the enemy, and on the other hand, there were loyal and brave generals. Yue Fei fought in Guangde, winning all six battles, and fought in Changzhou, winning all four battles. Han Shizhong used 8,000 people to resist Wuzhu's 100,000 troops in the Yangtze River in Zhenjiang for forty-eight days.

In fact, the Jin soldiers were not terrible. When Wuzhu captured Lin'an and pursued Gaozong at sea, his momentum was like a broken bamboo, how proud he was. However, when he returned to Zhenjiang, he encountered Han Shizhong's army. In one battle, his soldiers were defeated and his generals were killed, and his son-in-law, the Dragon and Tiger King, was also captured. So he begged for mercy from Han's army, willing to offer all the things he had plundered in Jiangnan to Han's army. Han did not allow it, and offered famous horses, but he still did not allow it, and asked to meet with Shizhong to beg for forgiveness. From this, the Jin army's cowardly state can be seen.

Wuzhu had 100,000 elite troops. He was defeated at Huang Tiandang and defeated by Yue Fei at Niutoushan, Jiankang. However, the Jin troops were able to come from the north because the Han traitors used rockets to break through the heavy land and water defenses. This proves that the Song army only had tactics but no strategy, and could not have a lasting, comprehensive, and complete plan. However, it is better to say that the Song court had no strategy than to say that the Song army had no strategy.

However, the fact that Han Shizhong and Liang Hongyu used 8,000 troops from a defeated country to resist Wuzhu's 100,000 troops for forty-eight days is of great significance.

When we present the heroic story of Liang Hongyu beating the drums to repel the Jin soldiers on the stage in the form of a drama, we must emphasize the following points:

(1) The contradiction between the pro-peace faction and the pro-war faction; the absurdity and shamelessness of the pro-peace faction and fear of Jin; the anti-war strength shown when the pro-war faction takes the upper hand.

(2) The demands of Han Shizhong and Liang Hongyu, in line with the demands of the military and civilians, are full of unyielding determination to strive for victory.

(3) The expansion, treachery, ambition, cruelty, and weaknesses of the Jin soldiers.

(4) Resisting the Jin soldiers was the common responsibility of the military and civilians of the Song Dynasty at that time.

(5) The Jin soldiers can be overcome, and the Song Dynasty can be revived.

(6) Others.

The overall task is to show the strength of the Song Dynasty in resisting Jin, and to objectively criticize its mistakes, and to "visualize" all of this.

In fact, history is just history. History itself is a scripture and lesson that can be mutually verified and explained with current events, or give us a reference, but it must never be confused with current events. Our current war of resistance is a war of a small and weak nation against fascism. This is completely different from the Song-Jin War. Our nationwide adherence to the strategy and tactics of a protracted war and a comprehensive war is planned and progressive. This simply cannot be compared with the Song court, which was undecided on whether to wage war or seek peace. Our enemy, Japan, is a capitalist country with considerable economic progress. This is also incomparable to the Jin Dynasty, a fishing and nomadic nation. We are a large and weak country with a relatively backward economy, but we can progress and strengthen during the war. Japan is a strong country with a relatively advanced economy, but it can degenerate and weaken during the war. These are also different from the situation of both Song and Jin.

These are just to express a point of view on how to deal with historical materials, and do not have to be set out in the script. We invite you to watch the historical drama and let the audience use his own feelings and thoughts to accept the enlightenment of history!

We Extend Our Sympathy

Foreword: The establishment of Dadi Film Company in Hong Kong can be said to be a meaningful work that marks an era in the film industry in South China. Regarding this, we have already introduced it in the 24th issue of this magazine. In this article, we can reflect on how obscene and shameless one side is, and how solemn the work is on the other. At the same time, we can see their correct attitude and the spirit of hard work and struggle towards film production in the future! This is a declaration of determination and a bugle call to arms! For the future of true national defense art and for the sacred national liberation struggle, we feel infinite excitement and joy. Therefore, without avoiding the suspicion of publicity, we are eager to reprint it, and hope that readers will not ignore it!

### We Need Sympathy

— Cai Chusheng

Lifting my head from continuous, sleepless, and foodless work, grasping this pen again, I want to write something. Although I feel an inescapable fatigue, I also feel an indescribable excitement—besides, I can't help but feel a mix of emotions.

I remember Mr. Fei Mu saying something that was not publicly stated (it was at a gathering for the film industry hosted by Mr. Xu Hao): "Starving to death is a small matter, losing integrity is a great matter." These words at the time made me deeply resonate and almost brought me to tears. Although he didn't say it outright, he was secretly putting it into practice. But in this "degenerate world" (this phrase may still not be enough to describe it?), some people consider "starving to death" even "greater" than "losing integrity." Therefore, speaking can be as irresponsible as farting. Any beautiful terms or pleasant words can be brought out and used by people who don't know what shame is, to deceive others and also to deceive themselves! Are they human words or ghost words? Perhaps many people can't figure it out? Sometimes, even a common phrase that is only at the lowest level, if people are to actually implement it, becomes something more difficult than beheading. From this point of view, Mr. Fei Mu should be regarded as a fool, and our group who have long been judged as "bound to starve to death" are naturally not worth a thing!

However, the truth and justice of the world, before humanity can return to the prehistoric age of beasts, will one day be upheld. Just like after a long dark night, or a storm, or a period of gloom, the warm sunshine will surely shine upon the earth again; just like throughout history, countless invaders, large and small, although temporarily rampant to the extreme, will one day embark on the path of total collapse and destruction. These are inevitable and very natural things. Therefore, we need not tremble or be timid. We should strengthen our faith with unchanging determination, for truth and justice.

"Dadi" (The Earth) is a new organization established in this dark and oppressive atmosphere, unafraid of any difficulty. It does not contain any "worldly wise" "clever people," nor does it have any substantial capital that can make people "lose their souls." It doesn't even dream of becoming some "artistic power" (if there is even art in China) or commercial "trust" in the future. All it has is a group of "big kids"—a kind of spirit of struggling without knowing the hardships and difficulties of the world. At the same time, it does not have any "lofty" ambitions. It just wants to do some ordinary things that every "person" should do. To put it more clearly, we will adhere to the position of artists (if there are artists) in the "extraordinary period," and under the principle of not obliterating "artistic conscience," we will devote our greatest efforts to our work. To put it even more clearly, we will use practical actions to prove the truth of what we said in the past, which some people considered "just beautiful words," or which some people have "laughed and cursed" at. But we have no malice. On the contrary, we sincerely and with goodwill hope that those who have doubted us will have a day of "realizing that the present is right and the past was wrong," and jointly engage in efforts towards the same goal.

Our work has begun. Our manpower and resources are very limited, and our intelligence is even more limited. We are still young and naive, and we need the enthusiastic support and sincere guidance of those who are wise. We vow not to be "Ah Q's self-satisfaction," nor "megaphones for the oppressor"! If our work is not considered meaningless, then I would like to sincerely ask the gentlemen and ladies who read this article to give us fervent sympathy and encouragement, to regard "Dadi" as your "Dadi." And I—one of the workers in the "Dadi" group—will work with my comrades, sleeplessly and neglecting meals, to work even harder and more vigorously, to repay your expectations to the best of our ability!
