### How Youth Can Accomplish Wartime Tasks (Part 2)

â€” Special Dispatch from Xi'an by Airmail

The fifth lesson we have learned is that the development of an organization must go through certain stages. Generally speaking, when an organization begins to develop, it must first unite the activists and then rely on the activists to unite the broad masses. The organizations of the broad masses are often weaker in their initial political nature and gradually strengthen to become more advanced organizations. Local organizations can gradually become national organizations through development. Disunified organizations can gradually become unified organizations through development. Any organization must inevitably undergo complex evolution; conversely, it is impossible to establish an ideal organization all at once without complex evolution.

The sixth lesson we have learned is that the development of an organization must be closely aligned with the development of the war situation. The development of organizations in war zones is smoother than in non-war zones because the military and the government's need for youth increases during wartime, and the youth's need for organization also increases. In some places, no youth groups were allowed to organize originally, but once the enemy came and the situation became critical, youth work teams, service teams, self-defense forces, guerrillas, and all kinds of organizations were set up.

The seventh lesson we have learned is that the development of an organization must be closely aligned with the development of general mass movements. We youth are the vanguard of the mass movement, so we must not only do youth work but also organize the general masses. This is one aspect. On the other hand, we youth also need the help of general mass movements to avoid being isolated; and in many cases, especially in rural areas, if our elders do not help us, our work will be difficult to carry out. Therefore, the youth movement and the general mass movement must have appropriate links.

The eighth lesson we have learned is that in the development of an organization, the top-down method and the bottom-up method must be closely combined. Under favorable and possible conditions, the top-down method has a great effect. If, at this time, the organization is only developed from the bottom up and does not receive help from the upper levels, it will inevitably encounter difficulties; but only relying on the top-down method, completely adopting the method of ordering the establishment and ordering the joining, there is no hope of development. Even if it develops, it will inevitably be unconsolidated and lack strength.

There are many youth groups that have offices and operating funds, but they have no actual work for months or years. Some youth groups only have committee members and no members, because all the members have become committee members. Not only that, but some committee members and officers are not even members, or they are not even clear whether they are members, because they only remember taking salaries. They have neither joined the organization nor attended meetings, and of course, they have not withdrawn from the organization. Perhaps they have joined the organization, perhaps they have attended meetings, but this is involuntary; in this situation, they cannot declare their withdrawal; they can only use passive resistance to show that they are only honorary members who have been hired.

This is not a joke, but a fact that everyone can see. This is because these groups have not paid attention to the bottom-up approach and have not paid attention to the principle of democratic voluntarism. Such groups are only a sign and a badge, and signs and badges cannot resist the enemy or build the country.

In order to organize the broadest masses of youth to jointly resist the enemy and build the country, we must not only study our experiences and lessons in organizational work but also study our experiences and lessons in leadership work. Whether an organization can develop depends on our methods of organizing youth, but if there is a good organization, good policies and resolutions, and no good leadership to ensure their implementation, the organization will still disintegrate.

What is considered good leadership?

First, implement collective leadership and individual responsibility. All work must be discussed in meetings and implemented according to the opinions passed by the majority. "Three cobblers are better than Zhuge Liang." After everyone's discussion, our work arrangements must be much more thorough. Once the work is decided, it must be assigned to various people to take responsibility separately, I take responsibility for mine, you take responsibility for yours, and at the same time, everyone must take care of each other and take care of the whole, this is called division of labor and cooperation.

Second, have a plan. Work must have certain steps and a certain center, and must not fall into a chaotic state of so-called clericalism. Just as riding a horse must hold the reins, our work must also follow a plan and grasp the center in order to have a clear understanding.

Third, there must be inspection. Simply having a plan cannot guarantee the completion of the plan, there must be regular meetings and frequent inspections to urge the execution of the plan, and to study whether there are any difficulties or errors in the execution. If the scope of an organization covers a very large area, the leading organ must have inspectors. The task of the inspector is not to mechanically issue orders or deliberately nitpick, but to help the lower levels solve difficulties. Helping the lower levels is not to replace the lower levels, and attention must still be paid to cultivating the ability of the lower levels to work independently and to bring into play the creativity, initiative and enthusiasm of the lower levels.

Fourth, there must be self-criticism. When we inspect our work, we will definitely find the advantages and disadvantages of the work. At this time, we need serious and bold criticism. We should not conceal our shortcomings at all, and there should be not only top-down criticism but also bottom-up criticism. But our criticism is not to attack, but to help and educate, so our criticism should not be excessive; we should not only see the shortcomings, but also see the advantages and promote these advantages; and we should not only be passive criticism but also point out positive solutions.

Finally, and most importantly, we must implement genuine democratic centralism. On the one hand, we must be democratic, and important opinions must be discussed and decided by everyone, and everyone must participate in the discussion and jointly take responsibility; on the other hand, we must also be centralized, that is, the minority must obey the majority, and everyone must obey the leading organs elected by everyone and the resolutions passed by everyone. The so-called extreme democratization means that no matter when and no matter what happens, everyone must discuss it first, and if the minority has any opinions about the decisions of the majority or the decisions of the lower levels about the upper levels, they will not implement them, which will inevitably lead to the stagnation of work. The organization will disintegrate, and democracy will not be talked about. Having democracy does not mean that discipline is not necessary, discipline is necessary and is also a kind of education method. However, discipline should not be too harsh, and it should not be abused.

All organizational work and leadership work must be done by someone, and that person is the cadre. Without cadres, what we have said is just empty talk, so it is said that "cadres decide everything".

Our youth movement needs all kinds of cadres. We need military cadres, political cadres, cadres who can bury their heads in hard work, cadres who can promote, speak and write articles, cadres who are good at socializing, good at united front work, and good at sports and entertainment work. Anyone who has a skill can become our cadre.

The cadres of our youth movement should be such a kind of people: they are loyal to the cause of people's liberation, they are able to get close to the youth and gain the faith of the youth - they are not afraid to take responsibility, do not talk empty words but can actually work; they are content with their duties, and are not always half-hearted, regardless of the importance of the work; they should be very lively, because liveliness is one of the important conditions for youth work; they must also be able to constantly learn from work, correct mistakes in work, and improve their understanding.

Because of the rapid development of the war situation and the youth movement situation, these old cadres gradually feel that they cannot adapt well to the new working conditions, so our cadres urgently need a new round of training. Our cadres need to fully understand the working methods of the youth united front, especially the working methods in rural youth. Our cadres should carefully summarize all the experiences of the peasant work in the XXXX area, the XXXX area, North China and other war zones, and summarize all the experiences of students in the peasant work. Our cadres should learn well from the rural youth, be familiar with all their lives, and strive to cultivate a large number of new rural youth cadres. In addition, we need to pay attention to the specialization of youth cadres, pay attention to the mutual transfer of cadres in various regions and at all levels, and promote the atmosphere of mutual learning among cadres, which is also an urgent requirement of our work at present.

We need excellent cadres, and we need correct cadre policies.

We must be good at recognizing cadres. Cadres are not perfect, and they will never be said from a model. As long as we can see all aspects of the cadre, use his strengths and overcome his weaknesses, we will find that everyone is usable. Otherwise, we will find that no one is usable.

We are good at using cadres. We must promote cadres from actual work and from a political perspective. Do not lightly promote and transfer cadres, so that cadres cannot be competent and cannot be at ease. We must trust cadres and make cadres trust themselves: certain instructions and inspections are necessary. But never interfere in everything, so that he loses his automatic confidence.

We want to love cadres. We must often help cadres. If cadres make mistakes, don't exaggerate them, and don't use serious terms to make them feel panic and psychological pressure. We must also pay attention to the work emotions of cadres and the legitimate needs in life.

We want to unite cadres. Ideological consistency is the basic condition for unity. Questions should be discussed more often with each other. Before discussing, we should think carefully. The more fully prepared we are, the more we encounter ideas, and the easier it is to approach opinions. The attitude of discussion should be humble, objective, generous, and able to put ourselves in each other's shoes, and be able to give up small differences and seek common ground. In this way, even if different opinions arise, they will not tend to extremes, will not hinder the basic principle of consistency, and will not affect the unity of cadres.

With correct organizational methods and leadership methods, with excellent cadres and correct cadre policies, our Chinese youth will definitely be able to complete our organizational tasks, and therefore will definitely be able to complete our political tasks.

Because we Chinese youth are striving towards the same goal in the same environment, we not only shoulder the same organizational tasks, but also in all our organizational work, we should and can consistently adhere to the same working spirit and the same style of work.

Our style should first of all be a firm political stance. Our position is the common program of Chinese youth, which is to adhere to supporting the long-term resistance war Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—, supporting the National Government and Chairman Chiang, supporting the Three Principles of the People and the program of resisting the enemy and building the country, and supporting the democratic and voluntary close unity of youth across the country under these principles, regardless of party affiliation, class, gender, or race, to form a great united front (applause). Our position is not to be shaken in any way; if anyone tries to shake our position with threats or inducements, we will make him recognize the great power of our Chinese youth. (applause)

Our style should secondly be flexible, enterprising, and practical. Because our position must be embodied in daily work, we do not welcome dreamers and empty talkers, what we want are those who are down-to-earth and work hard, we do not welcome empty terms and empty formulas, what we want are calm and thorough thinking, concrete and practical analysis of the situation, and solving problems.

Our style should be one of hard struggle. Because our work is inevitably not simple and easy, if it were, our ideal would have been realized long ago, and there would be no need for us to work. We must fight to the end with perseverance, we must be prepared at any time and anywhere to encounter difficulties and overcome difficulties, and to encounter obstacles and remove obstacles, we must be prepared at any time and anywhere to sacrifice everything for the liberation of the nation and the liberation of youth.

Our style should be democratic. Because only democracy can unite the broad masses of youth to fight together, only democracy can eliminate prejudice, understand the overall truth, overcome closed-doorism, promote the enthusiasm of youth, and expose those who isolate the masses. Our youth groups now lack democracy the most, and our country now needs democracy the most, so we youth must promote democracy even more and help promote our entire country to the path of democratic politics.

Our style should be youthful. Because we ourselves are youth, our task is to unite youth, and to fight for the interests of youth, our actions must be lively and courageous, full of vitality, we must be familiar with sports and entertainment work, be able to speak the words that youth can understand, be able to do the things that youth like, and develop all the virtues of youth.

We youth should especially study. We have already said that youth is the era of learning, and the natural task of youth is to study. Only continuous learning can make us constantly progress, and our continuous progress is precisely what all our work requires. The tasks of our Chinese youth are very heavy and arduous, therefore, our hard study is of decisive significance.

We will use this style and this spirit of hard study to carry out our organizational tasks. We believe that the spirit of all Chinese youth is consistent with ours; and we also believe that only in this way can we be worthy of the youth of China today.

Because we Chinese youth have this spirit, we are not at all distraught and at a loss in the face of the unprecedented crisis of our nation. We fully believe in the future, because we fully believe in ourselves. We believe even more in our great motherland.

We have already received the profound grace of our motherland, and we believe that our motherland will definitely continue to love us and support us in the future; we hope that the national leaders, the leaders of all political parties, the military and political officials, and the advanced people from all walks of life will continue to lead us forward. They will definitely lead us, and we youth will definitely not let them down. We will dedicate our pure and enthusiastic blood to fighting to the end for the victory of the war of resistance, and to fighting to the end for an independent, free and happy Republic of the Three Principles of the People!

### How Can Youth Go to the Countryside?

â€” Special Correspondence from Xi'an by Feng Wenbin

First Question: What is the special significance of rural work?

We have said that the development of the War of Resistance has led to most of our important cities being occupied by the enemy. Therefore, our future work must be centered on the countryside. Of course, focusing on the countryside does not mean that we should relax our work in the cities. We still have many cities in our rear areas, and in these cities, there are millions of young students, workers, shop assistants, and clerks who need us to organize, unite, educate, and mobilize. But the fact is that a larger proportion of young people are now in the countryside.

Can we rely on our villages to fight to reclaim the enemy's cities? Yes, we can. First, China is originally a backward country, and cities cannot represent everything in China. The enemy's occupation of many of our cities cannot control our fate. Second, China is a country with a very broad territory, and it is impossible for the enemy's forces to occupy and blockade all our villages. Even the cities in our rear areas cannot all be taken by the enemy. Third, and most importantly, China has revolutionary classes, revolutionary parties, revolutionary armies, and people. These forces make our countryside not only different from the countryside in Europe and America, not only different from the countryside in small countries, but also completely different from the Chinese countryside in the era of the Eight-Nation Alliance.

There are many difficulties in rural work, which is undeniable. The countryside is generally scattered and unconcentrated. Feudal forces and feudal ideas are relatively strong. The minds of rural residents are more conservative, and their vision is often limited to the daily trivial matters of their own families. Their cultural level is very low, and they are generally ignorant of the national crisis. Moreover, their lives are the most miserable, and their burdens are often very unreasonable. Coupled with the madness of Japanese imperialism, their suffering is particularly severe. Precisely because of these many difficulties, rural work is particularly backward and requires our intensified efforts.

Second Question: How should we carry out work in the countryside?

1. To carry out youth work in the countryside, we must first understand that it is inseparable from general peasant work. Because feudal ideas are relatively strong in the countryside, and the status of young peasants is very low, not to mention young women. Therefore, to carry out work among them, we must first start with the propaganda and organization of middle-aged and elderly people. In addition, rural youths over the age of fifteen or sixteen are often already married and bear very important responsibilities in production. Therefore, their lives are actually not far from those of ordinary adults. Therefore, rural youth work is particularly closely related to general peasant work. Because of this, we will not necessarily specifically mention rural youth when we talk about rural work later.

Secondly, pay attention to becoming peasant-like. Intellectuals are too far removed from peasant life, so the biggest obstacle to going to the countryside is the inability to become peasant-like. In the past, there was a famous leader of the peasant movement in China. He was originally a young master from a large landlord family and a returned student. He went to the countryside wearing a suit and stood on the table to give speeches to the peasants. At first, some people listened, but later, fewer and fewer people listened. After learning this lesson, he wore peasant clothes, lived among the peasants, and helped the peasants solve many daily problems. Only in this way did he gradually gain the trust of the peasants. From this anecdote, we can see the importance of becoming peasant-like. Becoming peasant-like means wearing peasant clothes, speaking the language of peasants, and integrating with peasants in terms of daily life. In particular, we must understand peasant customs and habits, and pay special attention to the relationship between men and women and superstition issues. Don't let the peasants find it unpleasant. We must also study the peasants' labor life and their inherent political concepts clearly so as not to cause mutual estrangement and suspicion.

Some young people went to the peasants' homes, and the peasants warmly poured tea for them to drink. Seeing that the teacups were too dirty, they refused to drink. When asked to sit down, they took out a handkerchief and dusted the stool again and again. Naturally, the peasants were unhappy. It is nothing for urban youth to wash their feet in a washbasin. When they live in peasants' homes, they wash their feet in the peasants' washbasin. The peasants hate these young people very much. They have wasted a few years of schooling and don't even know the difference between the top and bottom of the body. Urban youth also do not pay much attention to waste paper and casually use it to wipe their buttocks. When the peasants see this, they feel that these young people are really not human. Peasant customs and habits vary from place to place, and languages vary even more, so there are more troubles. Some words are very common here, or even considered polite, but saying them there is scolding. If you are not careful, the peasants may fight with you. In the South, calling someone "boss" is polite. In some parts of North China, it refers to someone who runs a brothel. From this, it can be seen that it is indeed not easy to become peasant-like.

Thirdly, we must go through appropriate intermediaries and bridges. When we first arrive in the countryside, we don't know the masses in the countryside, so in order to get close to them, we must first go through some people who have prestige in the countryside and are respected by everyone, such as the Henan Women's Drama Troupe, which went through a respected woman in the local area. Or through rural intellectuals, especially primary school teachers. Primary school teachers in China generally lead very miserable lives, are relatively young, and have a relatively clear political understanding, so their anti-Japanese sentiments are very high. In the countryside, because they educate the children of the local masses and can often write letters and solve problems for the masses, they are easily trusted by the masses. Therefore, going through them to approach the masses is of great help to the work. Or through active elements among the peasants, through the peasants' own leaders. These people are probably physically strong, smart, and active, can speak, and have some ideas. Some people are afraid of confusing these people with local ruffians. In fact, the difference between the two is obvious, because ruffians are idle and do not engage in proper occupations, so they cannot gain the trust and love of the masses. Or through the relationship of relatives, friends, fellow villagers, and classmates. If there are no such relationships, then become sworn brothers, sworn sisters, or even sworn fathers and sworn mothers.

In order to get close to the peasants, we also need to choose appropriate opportunities and use appropriate methods. Rural temple fairs and markets are the most capable of gathering the masses. It is, of course, very convenient to carry out work at this time. When the peasants are busy, it is best to help them with their labor. Some young people in Shandong organized a rural anti-Japanese team, which helped the peasants harvest wheat during the day and talked with the peasants in the early morning. Popular art, whether it is pictures, songs, or dramas, can best attract the peasants, especially young people and children. Sometimes you can also go through them to approach their parents. Opening small-scale schools and providing simple medical care are also very effective in approaching the peasants.

Third Question: How to organize rural youth and the general public?

Generally speaking, the form of organizational work in the countryside should be as simple as possible and should be able to adapt to the rural environment. This should be combined with the peasants' own needs. For example, if it can be beneficial to their cultivation and harvest, it will be easily welcomed by them.

When there are few obstacles, establish new-style, relatively strict organizations, such as the Peasants' National Salvation Association and the Youth National Salvation Association. However, the methods of grouping and holding meetings should also be flexible so that the peasants do not feel constrained or forced. Otherwise, you can also adopt old-fashioned organizations or superstitious organizations, which still have a considerable foundation among the peasants. We should join them and work within them. We should not criticize gods and scold ghosts, because that will not break superstition, but only increase the peasants' hatred for us. In these superstitious organizations, we must first focus on winning over their leaders to the path of resistance against Japan. In order to gain their trust, we must be able to integrate with them, burn incense and worship Buddha, and do everything patiently. A youth organization in Henan used this method to establish a very close relationship with them. Later, they completely guided their organization into a force for national salvation.

Women's work in the countryside should be done by female comrades. It is even better to start with older women. Women's organizations need some transitional forms to prepare. For example, first mobilize them to learn to read, recite anti-Japanese scriptures, sew clothes for soldiers, wash clothes, etc., and then organizing them will be easier. When doing women's work in the countryside, we must pay special attention to the rural customs. For example, do not put forward slogans against family constraints, but promote family harmony. It is the same content, but the former will arouse opposition from parents, while the latter will not. In some places, there are many nuns in the countryside. If we start organizing women from them, we will definitely not succeed. It is the same reason.

When carrying out children's work in the countryside, we must also pay attention to the attitude of parents. In some places, parents are afraid that their children will also have to become soldiers, so they oppose the organization of anti-Japanese children's groups. But if the words "anti-Japanese" are removed, they will not object. Of course, this is not a common situation, but it can be used as a reference for us. Children's organizations should also suit children's interests and should be particularly lively. For example, when teaching them in class, they should attend classes, sing songs, and when teaching them military affairs, they should practice climbing mountains and charging, and standing guard. The same is true for other work.

Fourth Question: How to carry out rural work after having an organization? To carry out work in the countryside, we must pay attention to the united front between the upper and lower levels in the countryside. We must go through the upper levels, through the Bao-Jia heads, Lian-Bao directors, or powerful gentry. In this way, we can get convenience in all aspects. During the work, on the one hand, we must strive to assist the government's mobilization work, and on the other hand, we must pay attention to appropriately using the united front to improve the lives of rural youth and the general public. In particular, we must pay attention to earnestly reforming the method of conscripting soldiers and earnestly implementing the decrees on preferential treatment for the families of anti-Japanese soldiers. In this way, the work at the lower levels can be carried out well. In many places, because the conscription of soldiers is unfair, there is corruption and fraud, or there is all kinds of abuse of soldiers. This not only hinders the mobilization work but may even arouse popular unrest. In contrast, the extensive military work of Jin-Cha-Ji not only went through much prior publicity and explanation but also implemented various preferential treatment measures for the families of anti-Japanese soldiers. In Jin-Cha-Ji, the children of the families of anti-Japanese soldiers bowed to them when they saw them. Youth organizations often help them chop firewood, carry water, cultivate fields, and harvest wheat. Not only are the families of anti-Japanese soldiers very happy, but the soldiers are also very happy. Therefore, the mobilization work is also carried out very smoothly. Secondly, we must also pay attention to developing the mutual aid and production activities of rural youth and the general public. We must set up more cooperatives. We must set up more rural night schools, literacy classes, and training classes to improve their education. Finally, we must pay special attention to the establishment and rectification of various rural paramilitary organizations. If we are in the midst of war, then the establishment of guerrilla units and the development of guerrilla warfare will be the only focus of rural work.

Fifth Question: The question of intellectuals going to the countryside

Intellectuals now need to shift from the cities to the countryside, and the countryside also needs intellectuals. Why? Because intellectuals are the vanguard of rural work. This is true for rural youth work, and it is also true for general rural mass work. Local intellectuals are of course like this, and external intellectuals still have a great role to play. Although intellectuals also have their weaknesses, because they do not understand and are not accustomed to rural life, their advantages cannot be denied. That is, they have many social relations and a strong political understanding, so they can easily approach people from all walks of life in the countryside and easily develop a united front in the countryside.

There are several ways for intellectuals to go to the countryside. They can work through long-term or short-term organizations such as rural service groups and fellow-villager work groups. They can work through organizations such as anti-Japanese support associations and sacrifice alliance associations. They can work through organizations such as mass schools, rural education promotion associations, and rural cooperatives. It is even better to work through military and government agencies such as Bao-Jia, social training teams, and self-defense teams. If they can assume some important positions in them and have a considerable status, the work will naturally be much smoother. However, in any case, they must be able to be practical, hardworking, patient, and persistent, and set an example in their lives everywhere. They must not only integrate with rural youth but also be their model and gain their trust. Only in this way can they truly become cadres for rural work.

The general process of intellectuals working in the countryside is usually to enter organization through propaganda. When organizational work has developed considerably, youth peasant cadres will gradually emerge, and intellectuals will become relatively senior leaders. Here we must oppose two tendencies: one is to look down on rural youth, thinking that rural youth have no knowledge and cannot be cadres for organizational work; the other is to look down on intellectuals, thinking that intellectuals cannot play a vanguard role and cannot be promoters of rural youth. Both of these tendencies are wrong. We must use the vivid facts from all over the world to shatter them to pieces.

### Our Army in Jin and Hubei Score Successive Victories / Enemy Enlarges Yellow River Breach, Transfers Troops to West / Our Air Force Flies Over Northern Henan and Central Hubei to Bomb Enemy

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] According to the Chinese military spokesman here yesterday, the lines have gradually become quiet in recent weeks, seemingly due to the Japanese army's lack of combat personnel and its failure to decide on an operational plan. There have been no changes on the Guangdong-Jiangxi front. As for the banks of the Ao River, only small contacts have occurred. The Japanese army's crossing of the Xiang River and advancing towards Qianjiang is not actually important, as the combatants are only about a thousand men, and they are threatened by Chinese troops on all sides. Recent news from the front states that the Japanese army is trying to operate in western Shanxi and attack Jundu. The spokesman said that only small contacts have occurred in the area. It would be a misjudgment to think that the Japanese army in Shanxi is making a major offensive. He continued that the Japanese army in northern Henan is expanding the breach in the Yellow River so that during the rainy season, the floodwaters of the Yellow River will flow entirely into the sea through the new riverbed, forming a natural barrier to isolate the Chinese and Japanese armies. As a result, the Japanese army can transfer troops westward from east of that area. The breach has already been expanded from 200 meters to 1,000 meters. According to a certain Chinese source, the Japanese army's purpose in expanding the breach in the Yellow River is to transfer troops from the eastern section of the Longhai Railway to attack Zhengzhou along the railway and enter Shaanxi.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 7th] Chinese sources say that the Japanese army is currently fiercely attacking Yichang and has begun to occupy the crossing of the Yangtze River, 135 miles west of Hankou. It is also reported that the Japanese army that crossed the Xiang River is still stubbornly resisting. The report said that Chinese guerrillas raided Qianjiang last night and engaged the Japanese army in hand-to-hand combat. After Chinese aircraft bombed them, the Japanese army began to retreat towards the Xiang River.

[Central News Agency, Zhangshu, 6th] The battle situation near Gao'an has become increasingly quiet in recent days. There have been no changes along the Xiangfu Temple and Jin River lines. However, a certain unit of ours still attacked the enemy from time to time. One night, the enemy's artillery positions in Shayuan Hucun were shelled by our artillery, and most of the shells hit their targets, causing heavy damage. The next morning, the enemy retaliated by firing four or five hundred shells at our positions and sending seven aircraft to bomb Xiangfu Temple and Gao'an City, destroying only a few buildings. On the 3rd and 4th and at night, the enemy's artillery fired dozens of shells at us again, all of which fell on the outskirts.

[Central News Agency, Xinghua, 6th] A squadron of our air force flew to the area along the Longhai Railway on the 20th of last month to search for enemy traces. At Yiji, Xinke, and Zhengyang, they discovered enemy troop transport vehicles and ammunition depots. They dropped many bombs, all of which hit their targets, killing many enemies. When the enemy hastily sent aircraft to intercept them, our air force returned safely.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 7th] Chinese sources say that eleven Japanese aircraft bombed Yuyang yesterday, dropping eighty-five bombs, burning five hundred houses, and killing twenty-six people.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 6th] On the 1st, more than two thousand mixed enemy troops advanced from Lishi to Liujiawan, twenty miles southeast of Liulin, attempting to besiege our army's positions. After our unit bravely resisted, fighting fiercely for three days and nights, the enemy failed. By the morning of the 4th, the enemy had suffered heavy casualties and retreated to the northwest.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 6th] On the 2nd, three or four hundred enemy troops from the area of Jingledong Lirun in northern Shanxi advanced towards Qiaomen (northeast of Jingle). After our unit counterattacked, killing more than fifty enemy troops, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated immediately.

### One Week of Battle Situation / June 1st to 7th / Military Commission Announces

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] The spokesman for the Military Commission said that since the enemy's so-called "May Offensive" attempt suffered a serious failure, the battles on the northern and southern fronts have continued to stir restlessly this week, struggling vigorously. Our army, with the remaining courage of repeated victories, has continued to make persistent efforts and has gained many successes, further suppressing the arrogance of the stubborn enemy. Regarding the important battle results, roughly speaking, they are as follows:

Guangdong Province

There were no major fierce battles in the Dong River area of Guangdong. However, in the Shilongtan area, the enemy army occasionally tried to harass us with small units, all of which were repelled. In the West River area, more than a thousand enemy troops divided into three routes this week, one from Yangmei Baoshuitang, one from Dawuo Fuhu, and one from Sanshui Highway, and launched fierce attacks on Sanbian Tumeng. By using mobile tactics, we surrounded and severely attacked them one by one. More than half of the enemy died or were wounded. The remaining enemy once broke through the encirclement and occupied the market, which has been thoroughly eliminated. There were no enemy traces along the Xin'an and Xinhe highways. Since the enemy army advanced from Longkou to Niuguling in the North River, the battle situation has remained intense in recent days. Under our superior firepower, the enemy casualties have reached more than four hundred, and the puppet team leader and chief of staff have been captured, along with more than a hundred enemy puppet soldiers. The enemy's momentum is collapsing. Our forces, which are active near Guangzhou, once broke into the city and engaged in street fighting in Xihua Road and Shuangmendiqiao and other places, annihilating most of the enemy garrison troops, capturing prisoners, and burning down many enemy offices, barracks, and warehouses. Later, the enemy launched a joint land and air counterattack from Guanyin Mountain, and our forces withdrew safely. In the wake of their shock, the enemy is now in a state of unease.

Shanxi Province

After the enemy in Shanxi suffered setbacks in the Battle of Mount Wutai last week, they shifted their offensive this week. The enemy troops in western Shanxi, starting from the 1st, launched a westward offensive in multiple directions. One route, with more than two thousand troops, attacked Qikou, and another route, with four or five thousand troops, advanced towards Liulin, attempting to divide and conquer Jundu in a coordinated attack. They were respectively blocked near the highways leading from Qi to Liulin, and the intensity of the battle was unprecedented in recent months. Currently, both routes of the enemy army have been defeated and are collapsing. By the evening of the 6th, more than a thousand enemy corpses had been abandoned. More than three thousand enemy troops in southern Shanxi launched an offensive on the 6th from Zhangdian, Yuncheng, and Heling, engaging our army in fierce battles in Lingjiao Village and Longling and other places. Our officers and soldiers bravely charged and killed many enemy troops. Currently, all routes are still engaged in a stalemate at the original positions, continuing the battle. More than four thousand enemy troops who attacked eastward from Quwo in eastern Shanxi have encountered our army east of Dajiaozhen for several days, fighting fiercely for days. The enemy army once invaded Wuguanzi and Xiaganquan. Later, after sending strong troops to outflank the enemy's rear, we launched a pincer attack, killing more than a thousand enemy troops, including the enemy's regimental commander Nanbu. We shot down an enemy heavy bomber. The enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated in disarray to their original routes.

Hubei and Hunan Provinces

The enemy in central Hubei, who attacked Suizao, suffered a setback and retreated towards Jingshan, Anlu, Yingshan, Tianmen, and Yuekou, attempting to defend the final stronghold of Zhongxiang. After our continuous fierce attacks, we directly approached the city of Zhongxiang and used artillery to bombard the city walls. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. Another part of the enemy army invaded Qianjiang from Yuekou, attempting to contain our army. We saw through this treacherous plan. In addition to intensifying the attack on the besieged enemy in Zhongxiang, we increased the deployment of large armies to encircle Qianjiang and also launched a pincer attack on Yuekou. After three days and nights of bloody fighting, only a few hundred enemy troops remained in the city of Qianjiang, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them all. The enemy in Yuekou is also facing difficulties from all sides and is unable to defend themselves. They are planning to flee. As for the enemy who attacked the north bank of the Xinqiang River in northern Hunan, they suffered more than two thousand casualties and their momentum has been weakened. This week, our army continued to advance and recovered Yingdi, such as Guojia Great House and Mabu Great Mountain, gradually approaching the suburbs of Yueyang. In recent days, the enemy has continued to send reinforcements, attempting to put up a desperate fight.

Northern Jiangxi Province

More than five hundred enemy troops with several cannons from Nanchang launched fierce attacks in two directions, one towards Liugang and one towards Xincun Market, and also released large amounts of poison gas. Our officers and soldiers braved the poison and charged, with the force of a tidal wave, and finally defeated the enemy, killing more than three hundred enemy troops and destroying two enemy cannons. Later, the enemy launched a counterattack with reinforcements, and a fierce battle for control ensued. By the morning of the 2nd, the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated into the city. Also, our army, which attacked Fengxin, took Phoenix Mountain and Yaqiuling in one fell swoop on the morning of the 3rd. The enemy in the city is now completely within our control. As for our army along the Ruiwu line, one day and night they suddenly used a part of their troops to launch an attack on the county seat from the southeast of Ruichang. The enemy responded hastily and was killed several hundred. On the 2nd, our army near Wuning bombarded the enemy's positions and then launched a fierce attack in multiple directions. The enemy fled in disarray, abandoning more than four hundred corpses. In recent days, we have continued to pursue them and have captured many prisoners. Currently, the vanguard has approached the city of Wuning and is launching a fierce attack on the city.

Other Areas

In addition, in northern Suiyuan, we captured Kalahutong, Fengshengmei, and Xiagobi. In Hebei, we captured Qinghe and Tong County, surrounded Wudi in Lujing near Neiqiu, and attacked Laiwu. In eastern Henan, we captured Lincai and approached Taikang. In southern Anhui, we recovered Shunan and cut off the enemy's communication between Tongling and Datong. In Jiangnan, we captured Xingwei and entered Jurong, recovered Yuanwei, advanced to Yixing, and attacked Wujin. We achieved great success in both strategy and tactics, which is also worth reporting.

### Shanghai Financial Market Enters Tense State, Foreign Currencies See New High Prices, Legal Tender and Yen Trend Downward

[Reuters Shanghai, 7th] The yen price fell again this morning to 9 jiao 2 fen per yuan in Chinese legal tender. A week ago, each yen was worth 9 jiao 4 fen 2 li 5 hao in Chinese legal tender. Afterwards, the Chinese legal tender depreciated slightly against the shilling by one farthing (i.e., one-fourth of a penny), so the yen rose back to 9 jiao 4 fen. However, observing the general situation, the yen exchange rate is very unstable.

Generally Observed to be Beneficial to Us

[Reuters London, 7th] Regarding the depreciation of the Chinese legal tender, a Reuters reporter specifically sought opinions from bankers managing Far East banking affairs. However, the bankers had no news to report. Some of them believed that the intention behind the depreciation of the Chinese legal tender might be to balance the difference between China's imports and exports. Some believed that those managing China's monetary system might feel that the past price of the legal tender was too high, so they wanted to lower it slightly. Still others believed that the Japanese-controlled Hsing Chung Bank is attempting to control China's foreign exchange. The intention behind the depreciation of the legal tender might be to resist Japan's conspiracy. In addition, many others feel that those managing China's monetary system are deliberately depreciating the legal tender, so that speculators have no way to operate. Although this type of strategy has not been publicly acknowledged by the authorities, in fact, banks managing monetary systems in various countries have often implemented it.

Three Reasons for Suppressing the Legal Tender

[Reuters Shanghai, 7th] Shanghai's "Ta Mei Hsiao Pao," owned by Americans, stated that rumors that Britain had suddenly suspended its aid to China's monetary system were a serious error. The "Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund" decided this morning to stop selling foreign exchange at the previous rate, seemingly for three reasons: (1) In the past two months, Shanghai's foreign trade has seen a very large import surplus. As a result of the unlimited supply of foreign exchange, the monthly drain of foreign exchange reached over Â£2 million. (2) The Japanese are attacking China's foreign exchange fund and a decision has been made to stop them. Recently, the Japanese have obtained a large amount of foreign exchange from the Equalization Fund, unprecedented in quantity. The Japanese use this foreign exchange to support industry and commerce in Central China. Furthermore, the puppet Hsing Chung Bank, using the "Hongkou puppet currency," exchanges it for legal tender in large quantities, competing with the legal tender in Shanghai's open financial market. (3) Because the controlled exchange rate is no longer fully consistent with general exchange conditions, a new, lower exchange rate must be generated in the market. Therefore, the Equalization Fund can continue to operate. "Ta Mei Wan Pao" continued that the Equalization Fund will definitely continue to operate, because the Chinese government is unwilling to see Shanghai's exchange rate deteriorate further. Today, the Chinese government's monetary policy is about to be placed on a new foundation, and the legal tender exchange rate will soon return to a stable level.

### Shanghai International Settlement Searches Passersby and Hotels One Million Times in One Month, Municipal Council Releases Statistics

[Reuters Shanghai Correspondence] According to statistics released by the Municipal Council, police officers in the International Settlement conducted over one million searches in one month in April of this year, in order to crack down on terrorist activities. 950,000 pedestrians were searched, as well as 3,000 cars, 6,900 buses, 12,500 trams and trolleybuses, 41,000 rickshaws, and 9,390 cyclists. 320 hotels and inns were also searched. Currently, searching vehicles and pedestrians has become a routine task for the Settlement police officers. Everything from handguns to small packets of heroin is subject to inspection.

### Yunnan Provincial Assembly to be Established on the First of Next Month

[Central News Agency Kunming, 6th] The Yunnan Provisional Assembly is scheduled to be established on July 1st.

### Ã— Occupied Areas Currency Chaos

[Haitong News Agency Shanghai, 7th] Recently, the financial market in North China has been chaotic, with at least eight types of currency in circulation. In the Japanese-occupied areas, the new United Reserve Bank notes issued by the Japanese army, puppet Manchukuo notes, Japanese yen notes, Korean bank notes, and Japanese military scrip are circulating. In addition, the central government's silver dollar legal tender is still in circulation, especially in the concessions of Tianjin, where it is more popular. In Shanghai, the Japanese yen notes and Japanese military scrip in the Japanese-occupied areas are mostly the Huahsing Bank notes issued. However, the central legal tender is mostly used in the ports along the Yangtze River, with only a few places seeing yen notes and Japanese military scrip. In Xiamen, the legal tender is issued by the central government, and banknotes from the Bank of Taiwan are also commonly used. The central government's legal tender is designated to be issued by four government banks, and provincial banks are no longer authorized to issue legal tender.

### Ambassador Guo Visits British Foreign Office to Protest Extradition of Criminals in Tianjin

[Central News Agency London, 7th] Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi visited the Foreign Office again yesterday afternoon to protest the Tianjin British Concession authorities' transfer of Chinese involved in the sniper case to the Japanese side.

### British Employee of Shanghai Lun Chang Factory, Dinkler, Died Yesterday, Covered in Wounds, Death Extremely Tragic, British Side to Protest After Autopsy

[Reuters Shanghai, 7th] It is learned that the British authorities will soon protest to the Japanese side regarding the murder of Dinkler, a British employee of the Shanghai Lun Chang Printing and Weaving Factory. However, the wording of the protest letter may be determined after the autopsy.

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 7th] Shanghai news, Dinkler, a British employee of the British Lun Chang Company who was previously arrested by the Japanese army, died of his injuries at 4:50 this morning, at the age of 45. Dinkler had an argument with the Japanese army in Pudong yesterday morning and was seriously injured. The Japanese side sent him to Hongkou Gongji Hospital at 11:00 last night, where two Japanese naval surgeons and two German surgeons performed emergency surgery. Three armed Japanese soldiers were stationed outside the hospital as guards. When Dinkler was sent to the hospital, it was discovered that he had a head injury, likely caused by a gun butt, as well as three stab wounds to his abdomen and legs. Despite the surgery, he eventually died of his injuries.

[Reuters London, 7th] The British government is taking a serious attitude towards the Dinkler incident in Shanghai. It is pointed out here that the area where the factory is located has long been under Japanese control, and there have been frequent disturbances among the workers. After the British side protested, the British army had promised to go to the factory to protect it, but the Japanese side made a written guarantee that it would protect British lives and property, and the British army withdrew. Yesterday, the British Ambassador to Japan raised this question, saying that some Japanese were inciting strikes, and the Japanese side was not taking steps to maintain order.

[Reuters Shanghai, 7th] According to reliable sources, the conflict at the Lun Chang Factory in Pudong yesterday was caused by the Japanese navy going to maintain order, and Dinkler inspected them as if occupying a British factory. As a result, Dinkler was knocked down by a gun butt, and the Japanese army kicked him and stabbed him with a bayonet, causing multiple injuries to Dinkler's lower abdomen. This incident occurred at 9:00 yesterday morning. The Japanese side did not allow foreign doctors to treat Dinkler until 11:00 at night, when he was transported across the Huangpu River. A Japanese spokesman announced today that after Dinkler was disarmed, he attempted to attack a Japanese sailor, so he was surrounded by other sailors. The Japanese spokesman answered reporters' questions, saying that the British Consul-General requested the extradition of Dinkler, but the Japanese side did not grant the request until Mr. Dinkler died. Reporters then asked why extraterritoriality was not respected in this incident. The spokesman said that if a person with extraterritorial rights threatens the Japanese army, the Japanese side can take this action in accordance with international law, whether long-term detention or execution.

Short Commentary

### Fluctuations in Legal Tender Prices

The sudden drop in the price of legal tender yesterday caused quite a stir in the market. Before the truth is clear, all parties should not speculate wildly, only to alarm themselves. However, we should have the following two basic understandings here:

First, this sudden drop in the legal tender is clearly a response to the conspiracy of Japanese Ã— to undermine our finances. For example, the recent large-scale absorption of legal tender from the occupied areas by the puppet Hsing Chung Bank to exchange for foreign exchange, resulting in a sudden shortage of foreign exchange, is one example. However, our government has long had a correct policy to stabilize the legal tender and has received the unanimous support of friendly countries. This drop in the legal tender can be said to have been expected by the government, so there is no need to "worry excessively" on behalf of the government.

Second, the conspiracy of Japanese Ã— and traitors to undermine our finances has encountered a relentless counterattack. As mentioned above, the Japanese Ã— and traitors cannot harm our legal tender. On the other hand, the price of the Japanese yen has also continued to fall for several days. Last week, each Japanese yen was only worth 9 jiao 4 fen in legal tender, and yesterday it had fallen to 9 jiao 2 fen. This shows that Japan's difficulties are irreversible.

In addition to firmly supporting the government's belief in resisting Japan and maintaining the legal tender, we must strengthen our friendship with Britain and the United States, and we should also redouble our efforts to crack down on the activities of Japanese Ã— and Wang's traitorous faction in all aspects.

### Aviation Committee Memorial Week, Mao Bangchu Reports

â€” Mi Langping

The Growth of the New Air Force, From a Victorious Stalemate to a Victorious Counter-Offensive, The Shortcomings of the First Phase of the War of Resistance Have Been Overcome in the Second Phase, Yang Jingzeng, Director of the Eighth Ordnance Depot, Relates

[This Newspaper Guilin Special Dispatch] A month ago, Director Yang Jingzeng of the Eighth Aviation Ordnance Depot came to Guilin on official business. The reporter learned that his visit was to carry out two major tasks urgently needed by the current Chinese Air Force. At the same time, he also knew that he had recently participated in the Aviation Committee's expanded memorial week in Chongqing. Therefore, after finishing the lecture, the reporter braved the rain to visit his residence.

Director Yang had studied in the United States for ten years and has made many contributions to the organization and distribution of Chinese aviation equipment.

He wiped his glasses first, and then said naturally: "At the recent expanded memorial week of the Aviation Committee in Chongqing, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Mao (Bangchu) specifically pointed out the 'New Trends of the New Chinese Air Force' and had a detailed analysis. I can talk about the main points: Deputy Commander-in-Chief Mao said in essence: 'First, the Chinese Air Force was indeed able to fully demonstrate the Chinese Air Force's long-term success, boldness, loyalty, and spirit of sacrifice in the first phase of the War of Resistance. But now we deeply feel that these performances alone, detached from the various important equipment that are closely related, are still not enough. In Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Nanchang, although some basic records were created, they were merely simple expressions of the skills and courage of air combat personnel, or it can be said that they were caused by the cowardice of Ã—'s air combat personnel (of course, we also have those who are afraid and cowardly, but they are a minority). As for the poor quality of air combat toolsâ€”aircraftâ€”(there are also a few that can catch up with Ã—'s); the difficulty in obtaining oil and bombs, which are not enough to distribute; the poor equipment of airfields; the lack of effort and seriousness of ground air force combat personnel; and the failure to effectively increase the wartime work efficiency of manufacturing and repair factories; the panic in the supply of aviation equipment; the insufficient promotion of political work at the lower level; the non-compliance of all management equipment with regulations; and there are also many other minor shortcomings in various aspects. All of these are major shortcomings that are sufficient to reduce the gains of the first phase of the air war."

Director Yang spoke with great passion and regret, because he was one of the ground air force combat personnel. Although he had tried his best to work hard, he still could not meet the actual requirements, so he said: "To realize the new records of the second phase of the War of Resistance, we must intensify our efforts!"

He took a sip of tea, frowned slightly, thought for a moment, and then said loudly: "I remember Deputy Commander-in-Chief Mao continued by saying: 'Second, the new Chinese Air Force has new trends in the second phase of the War of Resistance. We have found more lessons from past failures, and these lessons are the shortcomings that our various departments in the first phase of the War of Resistance neglected and did not have time to do. It is different now. We have overcome the major shortcomings in the first phase mentioned above, and we have actually tried our best to make up for them and correct them as much as possible. (For example, our future air combat tools will be able to exceed the high and low altitude speeds of Ã—'s aircraft, and they will be more maneuverable and have increased firepower. The number of oil and bomb depots has increased, and specialized management personnel are being trained by hand, and special attention is being paid to transportation in the southwest and northwest. The number of ground air force combat personnel has increased significantly. Just in terms of mechanical technicians, it has increased from several thousand to tens of thousands of people, and foreign inspections and studies abroad have been intensified, and they have consciously and voluntarily made and corrected efforts. The number of aviation factories and monthly repairs has also greatly increased. Although no manufacturing plants have been added, they have been able to make further imitations and self-sufficiency. The number of various fuselages has increased from several to several per week. The number of aviation equipment depots has also increased, and transshipment agencies in Vietnam and Burma, as well as electric refueling trucks, have been added. The large-scale purchase and increase of airlift aircraft and automobiles, the increase in working hours, the unfolding of efficiency, and the rapid promotion of political work, and even the active improvement of various equipment, although slightly changed due to the expansion of the war zone, are all established facts. We believe that it is equally important to promote the experience gained from victory, and it is not enough to overcome and correct shortcomings. Intensifying the recruitment and training of air combat personnel in various departments, actively strengthening and improving combat technology, and promoting the spirit of loyalty, bravery, and sacrifice are also ironclad facts before us. Therefore, the new Chinese Air Force in the second phase of the War of Resistance has also embarked on a new path along with the shift of the war situation and the needs of the times. It can also be said that from the victorious stalemate period to the victorious counter-offensive period is a more active, more effortful, and more arduous period for the new Chinese Air Force. We must recognize the war situation, grasp the war situation, recognize the importance of the mission, the arduousness of the task, and recognize the spirit of self-loyalty and sacrifice. Now is a rare and great opportunity to cash in, and all our air force personnel should create newer records with the greatest determination and belief!"

Director Yang stopped suddenly at this point, looked at his wristwatch, and said: "It's 11:35. There are originally many important things to talk about regarding the Air Force and the War of Resistance, but due to time constraints, fortunately there are many opportunities to meet, so let's talk about it next time." Finally, he said: "We must be fair and honest, are we worthy of the country, the nation, and our own conscience!" (Salvation Society Agreement)

Qinghai Special Dispatch

### Visiting the Buddhist Holy Land of Tar Monastery (Part 2)

â€” Jun Sui

When we came out of the hall, we saw an ancient tree, surrounded by wooden fences, with intertwined roots and an old posture. It is said to be a "Sandalwood Tree," and Tsongkhapa's afterbirth is buried under the tree. It is also said that the tree branches and skin are transparent, and Tibetan scriptures appear inside, which is just an old legend. To its left is a temple, with statues of gods in male and female embracing positions. It is said that the Tibetan name of the god is "Jiao," which is the same as what I saw in the Yonghe Temple in Beijing. Beijing people call it the Joyful Buddha, and some say that it is specifically for instructing the young emperor to know the posture of sexual intercourse, which is also unfounded. It is said that this is a deity of Tantric Buddhism, probably taking the meaning of "Don't be surprised by strange things, and the strangeness will defeat itself." Going upstairs next to the hall, we saw two rows of Lamas sitting cross-legged, chanting sutras that could be heard clearly. The paper of the sutras was very thick and strong, and it is said to be produced in Tibet. It is shaped like a belt, about two feet long and six inches wide, with scriptures printed on both sides and surrounded by black lines, comparable to Song Dynasty editions. Entering another room, we saw an old Lama monk holding bells and chimes, chanting as he struck them, the sound shaking the roof tiles. To the left was the treasure throne where the Panchen Lama sat, shaped like an old-fashioned Shanghai carriage, but the whole carriage was painted yellow, and the cushions were all made of yellow satin. Because it was locked, we could not see it clearly. After going downstairs, we went up the ladder again to see the gold ornaments on the roof, some shaped like pagodas, some shaped like umbrellas, and some shaped like bottles, all steel-plated with gold, dazzling to the eye. Looking around on the roof, we saw on the left side of the mountain, towering buildings connected to the clouds, standing on the horizon, knowing that it was the living Buddha's residence, like the mansions of nobles. The living Buddha lived in luxury, truly worthy of the honor of a commoner king. To the right of the mountain was the residence of the Lama monks, with thousands of buildings, lined up close to each other, accommodating about five thousand people. Looking down from the right corner of the roof, we saw the Lama monks gathering in the square in front of the lecture hall, studying the classics, the sounds of questions, answers, clapping when judging, and the echoes of the listeners, noisy and clamorous, debating in groups, no different from the symposium of an academic group. After coming down from the roof, we visited their kitchen again, with three large iron pots one zhang in diameter in the middle, and countless tea buckets beside them, which are said to be used to cook tea and distribute it to guests during incense meetings.

When the visit was about to end, the Second Master invited us to their Guben Jiwa (i.e., office) to rest and have tea and snacks. When we arrived, the so-called First Master and Third Master were also present, and they entertained us warmly, serving tea with great respect. They had baked pot cakes shaped like bread, some with cream added, which tasted very delicious, and there was also a kind of fried noodles, like fried rice noodles in the South, mixed with cream and sugar, which was difficult to swallow. The tea tasted good, but adding cream and sugar made it tasteless. I asked the Lama monk who was serving tea for plain tea to quench my thirst, and I could drink five or six cups in one go, because I had been running around for a long time during the day, and I was very thirsty, so I felt that the tea tasted even more fragrant. At this time, the Second Master agreed to invite the reincarnated Dalai Lama out to meet us. While we were waiting for this future Living Buddha, we chatted casually with the Second Master and others, and they told us about the origin of Tar Monastery and their organization. They established three academies of Sutra, Vinaya, and Abhidhamma purely for Buddhist research institutions. The Neizheng Ge Xi Yiwai (translated as Sage) presides over the affairs of the three academies, with a Dharma platform below him, translated as Dean of Education, who is in charge of education, and a Ge Kui Yiwai (translated as Director of Discipline) who is in charge of managing the behavior of all the Lamas in the monastery. If they violate the precepts, they will be whipped with this leather whip, which hangs next to the Great Golden Tile Hall, and it is frightening to see it. It is said that the Living Buddha was also taught the classics by the Dharma platform when he was young, and if he made mistakes, he could also be given a slight Xia Chu, but before punishment, the professor must first bow and pay respects, so the little Buddha was always trembling and at a loss whenever the professor knelt down, which is a strange story. After a while, a Lama came carrying the little Buddha on his back. When asked, he was only four years old. It is said that his father was addicted to alcohol and good at riding, and did not take care of his family's livelihood. His mother had foresight, so the little Buddha's character was very clever. Although he did not know Chinese, the Second Master told him to shake hands with us as a courtesy, and he had no ordinary childishness. I took a photo of him, and he had no fear. The Second Master asked him questions, and the little Buddha answered fluently. According to the Second Master, the Dalai reincarnation is that the three major monasteries in Lhasa, Tibet, send people to visit everywhere. All smart children in Qinghai, Tibet, and Xikang who can select the real objects from the counterfeit products in the utensils used by the Living Buddha before his death are selected. However, the three little Buddhas must still be determined by drawing lots by senior Lama monks, so it is rumored that wealthy families bribe their fathers and brothers to seek their children to inherit the Living Buddha.

We met the little Buddha and said goodbye. We still took a car back to our residence, passing through the Little Golden Tile Hall in the temple, and went down to visit the army. We saw that the hall had two floors, and the copper roof was plated with Kui, echoing the Great Golden Tile Hall, but the scale was smaller than the Great Golden Tile Hall, but it formed its own pattern, and the architecture was also extremely magnificent. Inside, there were Buddha statues, hideous and terrifying, and the smell of greasy oil was unbearable. We didn't look at it in detail. Behind the Little Golden Tile Hall, there are eight small mountains, which are said to be where Nian Gengyao killed eight Lama monks during his expedition to the west, so eight pagodas were built to commemorate them. In fact, Buddhism takes the perfection of eight kinds of merits as its highest goal, and many Buddhist temples build eight pagodas in front to symbolize the eight virtues. This kind of legend is really unfounded. On the way, we saw two Tibetan women and asked them to take a photo, and they agreed. A little further away, we met four local women, and I also asked them to take a photo. One woman suddenly rushed to avoid us. Fortunately, with the persuasion of passers-by and companions, she also agreed. It can be seen that even if an old woman or a young girl in Cairo is photographed with a camera, she will not be refused. Including the Mongolian prince and his wife who entrusted me to take photos at my residence a few days ago, I have now obtained images of the four ethnic groups of Mongolia, Hui, Tibet, and Tu, with different costumes, different religions, and very different lifestyles, but they can live together in one place and live in peace, which is really commendable.

Tsongkhapa was a revolutionary of Buddhism, no different from Martin Luther of Christianity. Because Buddhism was introduced into Tibet from India before the tenth century, to its end, the actors used evil arts such as swallowing knives and spitting fire to confuse the world, and smoking, drinking, and prostitution were rampant, and all purity was lost. It was not until Tsongkhapa was born that he shouldered the mission of religious revolution, taking Sakyamuni's compassion for saving the world as the spirit, and advocating purity, non-action, and abstaining from worldly indulgence as the precepts. He was born in the fifteenth year of the Ming Dynasty Yongle, in Xining, and died in the fifteenth year of Chenghua, in Lhasa, Tibet. After his death, his disciples, Dalai, Panchen, and Jebtsundamba, etc., passed on his clothing and efforts to raise money to build this Tar Monastery. The Mongolian and Tibetan people were extremely faithful to Buddhism, and Tsongkhapa's disciples reorganized the precepts, so they were admired by the public, making Tar Monastery the third holy land of Eastern Buddhism. All Mongols who believe in Buddhism take a visit to Tar Monastery as their lifelong wish, while the Mongolian and Tibetan people of Qinghai take a visit to the three major monasteries in Lhasa, Tibet as their supreme honor, and the Mongolian and Tibetan people of Tibet regard a pilgrimage to Sakyamuni's holy land as their greatest blessing and wisdom, which is nothing more than the mentality of "a monk from afar can chant sutras."

On our way back, we couldn't help but think of many questions, and we felt that the general public's misunderstandings and misconceptions about Tar Monastery were really incredible. For example, saying that their property is enough to compensate for the Boxer indemnity and more, they misunderstand the copper tiles plated with gold as pure gold roof tiles. Some say that if the Living Buddha's reincarnation can be elected from the candidates in Qinghai, then Outer Mongolia and Tibet can be annexed, which is again a misconception that the Living Buddha is still enough to rule Mongolia and Tibet. Others say that Lamaism is not Buddhism, and that the four sects of Black, White, Red, and Yellow are divisions of Lamaism, but they do not know that Lama is the Tibetan translation of Living Buddha, and can only be regarded as a sect of Buddhism, not that there is a separate Lamaism outside of Buddhism, and there is no reason to divide into sects by color. Tibetan Buddhism before Tsongkhapa had reached a state of decay and corruption, and if there was no revolutionary spirit to rise up and reform it, it would have been exhausted like a woman. This is a sect that replaces the old with the new, and it is also necessary to clarify the misunderstanding that it is their religious name. The majority of the Mongolian and Tibetan peoples have been living a nomadic life for thousands of years. The people do not know and do not know, and there is no opportunity to be educated at all. They only rely on becoming a Lama monk to have the opportunity to study the classics and learn to read, which is similar to the scholars in European monasteries in the Middle Ages. Before the government can generally improve the lives and education of the Mongolian and Tibetan peoples, the attempt to break their religious beliefs is also too early of a misconception.

### Chamberlain Reports British Sends Representatives to the Soviet Union To Continue British-Soviet Negotiations, French Side Acknowledges Smooth Success

[Reuters London 7th] Chamberlain made a statement in the House of Commons today, saying that the Foreign Office has sent a representative to the Soviet Union to continue British-Soviet negotiations. The Prime Minister said that after the final exchange of views between the British and Soviet governments, they have reached a general common ground, aiming to reach the original goal. The British government has done its best to satisfy the Soviet government, and the British government is prepared to establish an agreement on the basis of complete reciprocity. Military assistance discussed by the three parties is not intended to be completely limited to attacks encountered by the three countries' homelands. In other respects, the Prime Minister hopes that the three countries can reach a common compromise. The Prime Minister concluded that, "It is impossible to offer guarantees to countries that do not need them."

### Anglo-French-Soviet Mutual Assistance Negotiations May Successfully Conclude; British and French Military to Confer on Cooperation; French Cabinet Studies Soviet Counterproposal; Britain Drafts New Proposal

[Associated Press, Paris, July 7] Regarding the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance negotiations, the British and French sides have been discussing matters in London and Paris for several days. The French Cabinet has now formulated several new tacit agreements for the British side to consider, and then to issue an Anglo-French counterproposal to the Soviet Union.

[Associated Press, London, July 7] Britain has drafted a proposal that is expected to satisfy the Soviet Union's request to guarantee its northwestern borders, while specifically avoiding mentioning Estonia, Finland, and Latvia.

[Central News Agency, Paris, July 7] Foreign Minister Bonnet gave a detailed report on Anglo-Soviet-French relations at yesterday's State Council meeting. Cabinet members conducted a thorough study of the new Soviet counterproposal and sought a compromise solution acceptable to both Britain and the Soviet Union. Britain and France are continuing to exchange views, and Parisian sources believe that there are no major difficulties in the future of the negotiations and that they can be successfully concluded.

Content of the Soviet Counterproposal

[Central News Agency, London, July 7] It is learned that Britain has drafted a proposal to meet the Soviet demand for guarantees to countries bordering the northwestern Soviet Union, without specifically mentioning Estonia, Finland, or Latvia. A United Press reporter recently obtained the Soviet counterproposal, which stipulates: (1) Article 1: If any European country directly attacks any of the contracting parties, this convention shall immediately come into effect; (2) Article 2: If the contracting parties are drawn into war to maintain the independence of Poland, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, and Latvia, this convention shall immediately come into effect; (3) Article 3: If any other country is subjected to aggression and requests assistance, the three countries shall immediately discuss how to provide technical mutual assistance to stop the aggression. Consultations between the three countries shall not be related to the procedures stipulated by the League of Nations; (4) Article 4: The contracting parties shall consult each other before accepting new obligations; (5) Article 5: The contracting parties shall not conclude separate peace treaties or armistice agreements with other countries; (6) Article 6: This convention shall last for five years and may be renewed upon expiration. According to news agencies, United Press was the first to obtain the full text of the Soviet counterproposal.

Japanese Ã—Ã— Conspiracies Abound

[Central News Agency, London, July 7] News from Tokyo states that the Japanese government has decided that unless the Soviet Union is drawn into the vortex of Europe, Japan should not accept constraints in Europe, nor should it accept promises from the Axis powers in advance to provide military assistance. The impression among people here upon learning of this is still quite good. However, according to the latest news, the Japanese military faction is still working hard to promote close cooperation between Japan and Germany and Italy. The Japanese ambassador to Italy is known for enthusiastically promoting Axis policies.

Hitler Issues Ã—Ã—

[Associated Press, Berlin, July 6] Hitler gave a speech here today to the German troops returning from Spain, saying, "When I heard the cries for help from our people and relatives, I immediately sent ships to protect their lives as much as possible so that they could return to their homeland. At that time, Spain produced a person who represented all its people with his own power. General Franco rose up in time to fight and save his country. Franco suffered international harm until July 1936, when I formally responded to his request and provided assistance. Since then, the National Socialist Party has been active in Spain to establish an independent Spain under Franco's rule. I know that doing so will not only warn Europe but also warn other countries with the same ideas. This is the first time we have been able to demonstrate a common idea, and the international plutocracy cannot understand the movement of this idea. I sent you to rescue an unfortunate country and help a bright patriot save his people from fire and water. You return today, completing this heroic mission. I would like to tell the German people how they should thank you. You have demonstrated the spirit of the Germanic race and won supreme glory. Today the war is over, and I have decided to welcome you back to the motherland as a reward and encouragement. All the German people congratulate you. I would like to thank the army and navy. Your struggle in Spain is a struggle for Germany and a clear warning to the enemy. At the same time, we thank our allied forces. The Italian army fought bravely to resist destruction. Finally, we thank Spain even more. Spain suffered greatly from the war, which you witnessed and experienced, and now it has finally gained freedom and independence. At the moment, we look forward to the Spanish people building a new country under the rule of General Franco as soon as possible."

Editorial

### Will Japan Immediately Join the German-Italian Military Alliance?

Today's newspaper carries two contradictory pieces of news regarding Japanese foreign policy. First, according to news from Tokyo, unless the Soviet Union is drawn into the vortex, Japan is unwilling to sign treaties with Europe. Second, according to the same news, there are various events that prove that the Japanese military is making great efforts to bring Japan closer to Germany and Italy. Even the Shanghai dispatch of the "Sing Tao Daily" claims: Japan has decided to join the German-Italian military alliance, and the three countries will re-sign a secret agreement, the content of which is that Germany and Italy will each transfer a division of troops to China in the name of volunteers to assist Japan in its operations. If the European situation changes, Japan can also go to Europe alone to supplement the manpower of Germany and Italy.

This may raise a question in the reader's mind: Is Japan's current foreign policy really going to the stage of immediately signing a German-Italian-Japanese military alliance, or is it still premature? On the surface, this question seems to be just a matter of foreign policy towards Europe, but in fact it is also a matter of internal division. We would rather say that it is a reflection of the struggle between two different forces promoted by the Japanese invasion of China.

We believe that as the machinations among various countries become increasingly acute, the crisis of a world war becomes increasingly mature, and the diplomacy of various countries enters the era of alliance diplomacy, the reckless and adventurous young Japanese military men will of course try their best to promote the realization of the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance in order to expand the situation and suppress the opposition at home. Therefore, on the one hand, the Japanese army in China frequently creates terror against third countries, anti-foreign and anti-British movements, which have recently spread from North China and Central China to South China; on the other hand, the military personnel stationed in Europe are also actively promoting Japan's participation in the German-Italian military alliance.

But according to our observation, the development of the situation is not so rapid. The stagnation and setbacks of the Japanese invasion of China have made the Japanese political circles feel that it is indeed necessary to change or refresh the China policy. It is no longer successful to rely on recklessness alone. It is particularly noteworthy that yesterday's five-minister conference of the Japanese cabinet passed the policy planned by the senior statesmen's meeting to deal with the European situation. Former Prime Minister Konoe, who had been in decline for a long time, is now active again and is linking up with Elder Saionji everywhere.

Judging from the situation in various aspects, the Japanese elder statesmen's faction is indeed very worried about the invasion war against China, and they are trying every means to end the war as soon as possible. Therefore, they advocate appeasing Britain, the United States, and France, and of course they do not approve of rashly joining the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance at present. Some commentators believe that the young military men's reliance on Germany and Italy is also aimed at ending the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible, but it must be known that the two divisions of volunteer soldiers from Germany and Italy do not have much effect, and the result is just enough to promote the Anglo-Soviet-French triangular military agreement, and will expand the scope of anti-aggression to the Far East.

Recently, the Hiranuma cabinet attempted to "embrace" the abandoned political parties. The Minseito party also put forward the proposition of "reform," while the right-wing maniacs such as Suetsugu were left behind. I think it is not accidental!

### Siam Changes National Title; Cabinet Resolves to Change to [Sai]; To Be Submitted on the 24th of This Month

[Associated Press, Bangkok, July 7] The Siamese Cabinet meeting resolved to change the national title to "Sai," meaning the Land of Freedom, and announced that the constitution must be amended before this matter can be implemented effectively. The motion to change the national title will be submitted to the National Assembly on the 24th of this month, which is the "Revision of Treaty Memorial Day" in Siam. According to Siamese National Party members, the current national name originated from the Dongpu Yuezhai, which used to belong to Siam and is now part of Indochina.

Regarding the Change of Title in Siam

Regarding the change of title in Siam, Mr. Lu Juefei, a famous doctor in Hong Kong, submitted a letter to this newspaper pointing out that the translation of the word "Sai" as "Land of Freedom" is wrong. He wrote this article to correct it and add further explanation.

The original word "Sai" is Thai, formerly translated as "Da," and is the name of the nation written by Qian Luoshi. Two thousand years ago, it moved from the southwestern border of China and scattered in the Mekong River basin. This tribe calls itself "Da Ren". Judging from its physique and lifestyle, it is quite similar to the "Baiyi" in Sichuan and Yunnan. Not long after, the "Mon" people from Myanmar and southwestern Siam moved in and competed with the "Da" tribe. For thousands of years, the Mekong River has become the battlefield for their two factions to compete for supremacy. In the northeastern part of Siam, in the deep mountains and dense forests, there are so-called "rotten wood" Khmirs people, who are actually the remnants of Funan (the ancient country of Xidi'an, now French) and Zhenla (now the French protectorate, named Cambodia). They are the most despised by the "Da" and "Mon" tribes. To this day, the two tribes still regard marrying "rotten wood" people as the most shameful thing.

Although the composition of the Siamese nation still has many other elements, such as Chinese and Malays, the above-mentioned "Da," "Mon," and "rotten wood" are still its backbone, among which the "Da" tribe is more dominant.

### British Submarine Tragedy; Secretary of the Navy Releases Report; Praises the Honor of the Deceased Officers and Soldiers; Construction Company Responds with Donations

[Reuters, London, June 6] Secretary of the Navy Stanhope reported on the Thetis submarine tragedy in the House of Lords today, saying that three electric cables have now been wrapped around the submarine, and air floats are also tied to the side of the submarine. If the weather continues to be good, an attempt can be made to hoist it within 48 hours. Regarding the difficulties encountered by the divers, Stanhope said that the currents there are strong, making it difficult for the divers to stand, and because the submarine is tilted, it is impossible to stand on it. These two points are the difficulties in carrying out the rescue work, resulting in a shocking tragedy. According to the survivors, when the Thetis submarine crashed, the officers and soldiers inside the submarine maintained the best order, showing the best glorious tradition of the British Navy. The other personnel inside the submarine were also like this. Stanhope finally praised the heroic character of the bereaved families of the victims of the submarine.

[Reuters, London, June 6] Cammell Laird, the construction company of the Thetis submarine, has donated Â£5,000 in response to the fundraising campaign launched by the Mayor of London to comfort the bereaved families of the victims of the Thetis submarine.

### The Fate of the World and the Future of the Far East

â€” Shu Di

(3) Looking at the internal divisions of Britain, the re-approachment between Britain and Germany is even more distant.

Everyone knows that the large pro-German group within Britain is the so-called "Cliveden Set," which represents the interests of the financial community, bankers, aristocrats, and feudal landlords. The figures known as the generals are Halifax, the current foreign secretary, Dawson, the editor of The Times, Lothian, the newly appointed ambassador to the United States, and Garvin, the editor of the Observer. Among these, the few whose names are mentioned above have always been strong pro-German advocates. But now, they have all changed their tune and stood on the anti-German side. Even more noteworthy than these people is Astor, the owner of the Observer, who is in the position of host of the "Cliveden Set," who has changed his attitude. Astor has always been regarded as the German diplomatic agent in Britain, but now he openly advocates that Britain can no longer make concessions. All this is a big change.

In recent days, Prime Minister Chamberlain has been constantly wandering on a two-way street, either with the Soviet Union or simply making concessions to Germany to the end. Each time, from the above-mentioned figures in the "Cliveden Set," he has received advice that is different from the past, that he should no longer succumb to Germany at all. Now, the only person who still retains his original position and advocates continuing the pro-German theory seems to be Wilson, the current adviser to Chamberlain. However, compared with the vast voice of all Britain to unite with the Soviet Union, his voice is not even as loud as the humming of mosquitoes.

However, these only represent a major trend. As for how it will be expressed when it comes to actual individual issues, that is of course another question. For example, what about the issue of Danzig? Now, no one dares to predict what attitude Britain will take. The German side also knows "the change in the attitude of these pro-German people in Britain recently, so in order to save the situation, Ribbentrop, the current foreign minister, who is known as a 'British expert,' dispatched" his confidant Gyr to Britain last week to carry out various activities in the social sphere. As soon as Gyr arrived in Britain, he immediately gathered all the pro-German people in the opposition and in the government to exchange many opinions. However, the effect achieved seems to be not great, and the biggest failure is that the news he spread about the German-Soviet negotiations after Litvinov's departure was immediately solemnly denied by Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky.

Just by looking at the happiness of Foreign Secretary Halifax after Ambassador Maisky's denial, it is clear how much Britain today hopes to approach the Soviet Union and alienate Germany.

(4) The Formal Announcement of the German-Italian Military Alliance and Japan's Retreat Halfway

The existence of the German-Italian military alliance has been around for more than a day, and the recent formal announcement did not cause much surprise. However, what caused a little surprise was Japan's retreat halfway. From Japan's point of view, this move is very unfavorable to itself. Japan, which has repeatedly declared that it wants to create a "New Order in East Asia," and the policy of maintaining the Nine-Power Treaty by the United States, Britain, and France, which have emphasized sending "final opinions" to Japan, have in fact cut off the possibility of compromise. Does it already intend to admit defeat and prepare to abandon the so-called "New Order in East Asia"?

Obviously, this is not the case. In today's Britain, the prevailing explanations seem to be only two: (1) the U.S. fleet's return to the Pacific; (2) the success of China's resistance war.

According to the news obtained here, Japan had originally agreed to send its navy to the Mediterranean to demonstrate. Later, seeing the tough attitude of Foreign Minister Ciano, who was responsible for the negotiations, Japan suddenly became afraid. Of course, it was afraid of making a mistake and truly starting a war with Britain, the United States, and France. So it hesitated, which caused its ambassador to Italy to almost resign in anger.

However, this absolutely does not constitute a reason to withdraw from the military alliance. Japan does not dare to fight against China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. In fact, at present, Germany and Italy do not have the courage to do so.

Of course, Britain still wants to separate Japan from the aggression group. However, Britain's attitude towards the Soviet Union and China has other considerations and will not fundamentally change because of this move by Japan.

This move by Japan, apart from chilling the hearts of Germany and Italy, seems to have little other influence. Its already isolated position is even more isolated. From the perspective of diplomatic application alone, this is really a very meaningless and very flustered look for itself. However, judging from various symbols, this retreat is only temporary. If it does not admit defeat and insists on creating some "New Order in East Asia," then, the trend of the times is that even if it knows that joining Germany and Italy is a risk, it will eventually be drawn in.

Local News

### Chinese Representatives Respond to Factory Association: Authorities Have Not Ordered Factory Relocation; Four Representatives Agree to Forward Concerns to Hong Kong Government for Reference

It was reported in the newspapers a few days ago that the government authorities had decided to improve the urban area and had designated King's Road on Hong Kong Island and Ma Tau Kok and Cheung Sha Wan in Kowloon as industrial zones, requiring all factories to relocate within the year. Factory managers were alarmed upon hearing this news and filed complaints with the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong, urging them to find a way to remedy the situation. The association then convened a council meeting to discuss the matter. Everyone agreed that if the newspaper report was accurate, it would not only result in significant losses for the factories but also create insurmountable obstacles. It was decided to send a letter to the four Chinese representatives to convey the situation, explaining everything to the government authorities. Yesterday, a reporter visited the director-general of the association regarding this matter. According to him, the association had received a letter from the four Chinese representatives informing them that the Hong Kong government had not made any proposals regarding the designation of industrial zones. Therefore, the newspaper report from a few days ago was not factual. The association's letter to the four Chinese representatives and the representatives' reply are transcribed below.

Worried About Relocation

The association's letter to the four representatives, addressed to Sir Lo Yuk-ho, Mr. Chow Tsun-nin, Mr. Lo Man-kam, and Mr. Tam Ah-shi, stated: "With respect, it was reported in the newspapers yesterday that the authorities had decided to improve the urban area, establish a City Design Ordinance for 1939, and organize an Urban Improvement Design Committee. After the implementation of this ordinance, the first step would be to designate different areas as residential, industrial, or commercial zones. We have heard that the industrial zones have been designated as King's Road on Hong Kong Island and Cheung Sha Wan Road or Ma Tau Kok in Kowloon. Factory managers in Hong Kong were alarmed upon hearing this news and have been inquiring about the truth of the matter, fearing that if it becomes a reality, the original factories will suffer unlimited losses, and closure will be inevitable. We immediately convened a meeting to discuss the matter and felt that you, as representatives of the Chinese community, share our concerns and are close to the government authorities. Therefore, we will convey the public opinion of the association to you, as follows:"

Six Reasons Against Relocation

"(1) There are over a thousand factories of all sizes in Hong Kong. The three industrial zones mentioned in the newspaper report would be difficult to accommodate them all. Furthermore, due to the impact of the war, transportation is inconvenient, and building materials are scarce and extremely expensive. It is practically impossible to construct or supply a large number of factories for the relocation of the original factories in a short period of time. (2) The cost of self-construction ranges from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the content must be factory-style. Once they are ordered to relocate, renting from others will not be applicable. Who will be responsible for the losses? (3) The construction costs of established factories, such as the installation of water and electricity, the assembly of machinery, and all labor and materials, range from thousands to tens of thousands of dollars. If they are ordered to relocate, the original construction costs will be sacrificed, and a huge new construction cost will be incurred. In addition to this, the relocation costs alone will be considerable, which is beyond the means of most factories. (4) The establishment of each factory must have been approved by the government. If they are ordered to relocate, the government will inevitably lose credibility, and the factories will suffer losses without compensation. (5) Factories that manufacture dangerous goods were ordered to relocate to the government-designated dangerous zone last year. However, the industrial zones mentioned in the newspaper report do not include the dangerous zone. This means that these factories will have to relocate again in such a short period of time. The losses to the factories are indescribable, and the government's inconsistent policies will inevitably be criticized and leave manufacturers at a loss. (6) Hong Kong has been a transshipment port for a century and is now changing its old appearance. The construction of factories is increasing rapidly, and it is possible to become an industrial port. However, the capital of Chinese factories is meager compared to Europe and the United States. Therefore, the government authorities should support and protect them, allowing them to grow, and should not impose harsh restrictions that make it difficult for them and hinder the development of Hong Kong's industry. Otherwise, those who come to Hong Kong for industry will inevitably go elsewhere, which will affect the prosperity of Hong Kong."

Requesting the Government to Delay Implementation

"The above are the reasons why our association members oppose relocating to the industrial zones mentioned in the newspaper report. We respectfully request that you inquire with the government authorities about the truth and convey the situation below. We would be extremely grateful. As for the proposal to establish industrial zones, it is certainly a good intention, but we also ask the government to adopt a gradual approach, allowing existing factories to remain in their original locations and requiring new factories to be established in designated industrial zones, gradually improving the situation, so as not to undermine the government's credibility, and the original factories will not suffer huge losses. This is what our members hope for with our humble sincerity. We hereby send this message and respectfully wish you good health. Ye Lan-quan, Chairman of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong."

The Government Has No Such Motion

The four Chinese representatives replied: "Chairman Lan-quan, With respect, we acknowledge your letter, which quoted the newspaper report from yesterday that the authorities had decided to improve the urban area and that the industrial zones had been designated as King's Road on Hong Kong Island and Cheung Sha Wan Road or Ma Tau Kok in Kowloon, and listed four points of the proposal, requesting us to inquire with the government about the truth and convey the situation. According to our understanding, the Hong Kong government has not made any proposals regarding the designation of industrial zones. However, the various points mentioned in your letter are precautionary measures, and we have conveyed them to the government for reference in implementing municipal facilities. Respectfully, Lo Yuk-ho, Chow Tsun-nin, Lo Man-kam, Tam Ah-shi."

### French Envoy Gosselin Has Departed for Haiphong, then to Chongqing

According to sources, French Envoy Gosselin took the "Pique" to Haiphong before going to Chongqing. He will not be stopping anywhere along the way, therefore he won't be visiting Hong Kong. It is estimated that he will arrive in Haiphong yesterday.

### Entrance Exams for Free Government School Placements Began Yesterday

The exams for free placements in Hong Kong's government-run boys' schools were held yesterday afternoon at the government-run Chinese Middle School. A great many students participated.

### Another Robbery!! Gunshots Ring Out on Tai Po Road; Police Detectives Encircle and Arrest Three Robbers; Shots Fired in Vain; Failing to Escape, All Were Captured

Yesterday morning, Kowloon detectives received a tip that a gang of thieves intended to commit robbery somewhere in the New Territories. Upon receiving the report, the police station dispatched Detective Inspector Beeby, along with several Chinese and Western detectives, to investigate. At 9:00 AM, they arrived at Tai Po Road and ambushed the area around the "Three and a Half Mile Stone" area. After waiting for two hours, around 11:00 AM, they spotted several men with suspicious appearances walking along Tai Po Road. The detectives ordered them to stop for inspection. Upon hearing the detectives' orders, the men immediately turned around and fled, scaling the walls on the side of the road and running down the hillside. While escaping, they appeared to be drawing their guns. Inspector Beeby led the detectives in hot pursuit and, realizing that the men intended to draw their guns and resist arrest, fired three shots at them as a preemptive measure. One man was immediately shot in the foot and injured. The other detectives also opened fire at the fleeing men, but missed. Inspector Beeby and the detectives continued their brave pursuit and eventually captured two of the men who were unable to escape. The remaining men escaped. After capturing the two men, the detectives searched the area and found two handguns. The detectives then took the injured man and the two captured men back to the police station for investigation. The man wounded by Inspector Beeby was sent to the hospital for treatment and then placed under police guard. It is understood that the men were carrying weapons and seemed to have some kind of plan. Unexpectedly, the detectives discovered their scheme and captured them. When the detectives were chasing them, the men initially wanted to open fire and resist arrest. However, due to a sudden malfunction of the gun mechanisms, the bullets jammed and could not be fired, so they had no choice but to abandon their weapons and flee. Otherwise, a fierce battle between the police and bandits would have been unavoidable. After the incident, the detectives carefully inspected the recovered handguns and found that the bullets were indeed jammed. The police are now preparing to charge the three men.

### Armed Robbery Case on Des Voeux Road: Suspect Interrogated Yesterday Morning; Liu Wenzhu Charged with Illegal Possession of a Firearm and Attempted Robbery; Suspect Still Recovering from Injuries, Judge Orders Remand for One Week

Liu Wenzhu, 31, the suspect wounded and captured by Chinese Detective Tam Song in the sensational armed robbery and murder of a bystander and a detective in Li Yuen East Street, was charged by Chief Detective Inspector Hockin in the Central Magistracy presided over by Justice Edwards yesterday morning with two counts: 1. Attempting to rob Zhang Dazhi on Li Yuen East Street on June 5; 2. Possessing a handgun and five rounds of ammunition without a police superintendent's license. The case caused a sensation throughout Hong Kong on the day it occurred. People in Hong Kong were eager to see the face of the fierce bandit who dared to rob passersby and resist arrest by firing a gun in broad daylight in the prosperous Central district. Therefore, the courtroom was extremely crowded with spectators. When the defendant Liu Wenzhu was brought into the dock, he was wearing a white shirt, his head was bandaged due to an unhealed wound, and there were bloodstains on his clothes. He looked quite haggard. After the clerk read out the charges against the defendant, the Chief Detective Inspector asked the judge to remand the case for one week before further questioning. The judge granted the request. It was also learned that Chinese Detective Yin Wen, who bravely captured the thief on the day of the incident, was shot in the abdomen and seriously injured. After being taken to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment, his condition had not improved by yesterday morning and had even worsened slightly, raising concerns about his life.

### Tan Ah-shi Explains Yesterday: Reason for Banning Pig Farming in Kowloon; Urban Areas Expanding Outwards, Animal Husbandry Hampers Hygiene; Government Considered Before Implementing the Ban; Continued Animal Husbandry Still Possible in New Kowloon and the New Territories

The health authorities' decision to ban pig farming in Kowloon by September 30 of this year has sparked a reaction from hundreds of local farmers, who have recently hired lawyers and sent representatives to the authorities to appeal, requesting that the order be withdrawn in order to maintain their livelihoods. Details of the situation have been reported in the newspapers. After receiving the farmers' petition, the health authorities realized that the farmers had many misunderstandings and did not fully understand the government's ban on livestock farming. At the same time, the health bureau's Chinese councillors, Tan Ah-shi, Chow Sik-nin, Tang Siu-kin and Wong Ping-yiu held a meeting on the afternoon of the 6th to discuss the government's ban on pig farming in Kowloon and the farmers' request for withdrawal in detail. Regarding the points misunderstood by the farmers, the Chairman of the Health Bureau, Mr Todd, specifically commissioned the Chinese councillor, Mr Tan Ah-shi, to give a detailed explanation to reporters, in order to dispel doubts and facilitate the progress of the government's administration.

Close to Urban Areas; Affecting Hygiene

When interviewed by reporters yesterday, Councillor Tan first explained the reasons why the government is implementing the ban on pig farming. He said that in recent years, Hong Kong has become increasingly prosperous with the progress of the times, especially with the rapid increase in population, and the suburbs have gradually expanded outwards. Kowloon, in particular, has made great progress. Areas that were once barren have now been transformed into tall buildings. As a result, pig farmers in Kowloon are gradually approaching urban areas. Because the grazing, excrement, and feed of all livestock have a great impact on the health of residents, the government authorities, in order to adapt to environmental needs, have adopted a policy that is not easy for the development of urban areas. Residents' hygiene should have complete protection. On the other hand, the farmers in the Kowloon area have lived and grown up there and have a long history in Kowloon. Once they are banned, their livelihoods will be affected. Therefore, the ban has been carefully considered. As a result of weighing the pros and cons, it was finally decided that it would be more appropriate to relocate the farmers. Therefore, there was a proposal to implement the ban by September 30 of this year.

Banning Animal Husbandry; Only Within Designated Areas

As for the locations where the ban will be implemented in the future, it is not as reported in the newspapers that all farmers in the Kowloon area will be banned, because the geographical division is very clear. The banned area only belongs to the Kowloon area, and its scope is south of Boundary Street. Within the banned area, farmers, whether or not they have licenses, are not allowed to raise livestock. The authorities have also recently decided not to issue any more licenses, as a preliminary step in implementing the ban. As for the area north of Boundary Street, which also belongs to the New Kowloon area, those who have licenses can continue to raise livestock after the ban is implemented. Farmers who hold old licenses can also exchange them for new licenses on schedule, but when the license holder changes jobs, they cannot transfer the license to others. Violators will have their licenses canceled by the government. As for the New Territories, the government has not imposed any restrictions. Livestock can be raised in any area, as a fallback position for the relocation of farmers in Kowloon.

Government Ban; Based on Regulations

Mr Tan further explained that the government is implementing the ban based on Article 15 of the 1935 Public Health and Cleansing Ordinance, which was approved for implementation in September 1938. This ordinance is also closely related to the history of the Health Bureau. Before 1938, the Municipal Health Bureau was originally the Cleansing Bureau. Later, it was reorganized into the Municipal Health Bureau. After this reorganization, the regulations were slightly changed. Since 1935, Article 15 of the Health Regulations regarding animal husbandry (including raising pigs, cattle, and sheep) has also made detailed provisions. The distance between the pigsty and the house must not be less than six feet. The ditches in the pigsty must not be connected to private or public ditches. The building materials of the ditches should be brick, stone, or materials that have been tested and approved. The pigsty must have adequate light. The floor of the pigsty should be paved with stone or covered with cement or impermeable materials, and the ditches must be connected to a water well. The water well must also be approved by the authorities. However, the authorities can be flexible in handling this point based on the circumstances.

Animal Husbandry Locations; Must Be Cleaned

The regulations also stipulate the location for raising cattle. Each cow must occupy 32 square feet of space and have 360 cubic feet of air space. The height of the cowshed must be 12 feet. Each sheep must occupy 8 square feet of space and have 90 cubic feet of air space. Each pig must occupy 8 square feet of space. The minimum height of the pigsty is 4 feet. In addition, all places and houses for raising pigs and sheep should be thoroughly cleaned twice a year. No other items should be stored in the pigsty at the same time. If the license holder is not residing in Hong Kong, their authorized agent must be responsible for reporting to the government veterinary officer, the health bureau, or the police station if livestock are infected with an epidemic. If livestock die of disease, they must not be moved without permission. They must be moved or buried with the approval of the veterinary officer. If the license holder violates the above regulations and is punished more than twice, the authorities have the right to revoke their license at any time.

Designated Areas; For Animal Husbandry

Farmers without licenses must have a clean water source near their livestock farming area and wash the farm frequently. The cattle or sheep they raise cannot be released to graze in the grassland without permission. However, this does not apply to lambs and pigs. As for the number of pigs, cattle, and sheep, two cattle that are one year old or older are counted as one head, and two lambs or goats or two pigs that are under four months old are counted as one head. Finally, Mr Tan said that before the government implemented the ban on pig farming in Kowloon, it had designated five areas for farmers to bid for as livestock farming locations: (1) Tsing Yi Island, (2) Ma Wan Island, (3) Tsuen Wan, (4) Kwai Chung, (5) the New Territories. The above five locations have abundant water sources and ample air, making them very suitable for livestock farming. Farmers in Kowloon can seek new locations in these areas and do not need to pay too much attention to the old locations. According to the authorities' accurate investigation, there are approximately 300 farmers without licenses in Kowloon, of which approximately 100 are in Old Kowloon and approximately 200 are in New Kowloon. Therefore, the number of people who will be considered to have difficulties when the government implements the ban is only the 100 unlicensed farmers in Old Kowloon. It should not have a significant impact on the general social problems.

### The War on Hainan Island is Increasingly Advantageous to Us; Counterattack on Lehui Nears the Suburbs; Fierce Battle with the Ã— for Three Days and Nights, Annihilating Over Two Hundred Ã—; Eastern Hainan Ã— Harassment at Xiantian Village Suffers Another Heavy Blow

(Southern Route Express Report) The war on Hainan Island has intensified again recently. The Ã— army, in late May, implemented a so-called "mopping-up policy," attempting to annihilate our security team guerrilla groups on a large scale. Therefore, the battle situation was quite fierce. However, due to the united and heroic fighting of the military and civilians on Hainan Island, and after weeks of hard fighting, the Ã— conspiracy was finally shattered. At the same time, Wu Daonan, the administrative commissioner and security commander of the Ninth District, has crossed over to preside over the war on Hainan Island, and the situation is becoming increasingly favorable to us.

Our Troops Approach the Suburbs of Lehui City

The invading Ã— forces, having suffered repeated heavy blows, attempted to launch a large-scale mopping-up operation against us. Starting on May 24th, the Ã— forces from various places in Wenchang, Ding'an, Lehui, and Eastern Hainan, with four to five thousand men, launched an offensive against us. Longtang, Tunchang, Ruimu, Puqian, and Xinyu were all targets of the Ã— mopping-up operation. However, due to our army's elusive strategy of avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, and launching surprise attacks on the Ã—, we were able to recover many important strongholds. Our security team, led by Deputy Commander Luo Lianjun, launched a large-scale counterattack on Lehui from the 27th to the 29th of last month, approaching the suburbs and engaging in a fierce battle with the Ã—, fighting hard for three days and nights. They are now tightly gripping the suburbs and continuing to advance. In this battle, over two hundred Ã— were annihilated. Our Long Regiment and a certain unit of Liang Brigade's garrison also suffered considerable casualties.

Eastern Hainan Ã— Army Harassment Annhilated

Jiaji City in Eastern Hainan County was once recovered by us, but later, in order to gain a strategic initiative, we withdrew again. On the 30th of last month, the Ã— forces in Jiaji sent out a team of over a hundred men to harass and search for our guerrilla forces. They were ambushed by our army in the Xiantian Village area and were intercepted. The Ã— forces, unable to withstand the attack, retreated along their original route. In this battle, over ten Ã— officers and soldiers were annihilated. On the 31st, the Ã— forces again sent over two hundred infantry and cavalry to plunder and search the villages near Huanggang Shangling. The villagers were accused of being guerrillas and were brutally killed. As for our guerrillas in various places, due to their elusive movements, although the Ã— forces have exhausted all means, they have been unable to annihilate them and are sighing at their own futile efforts.

### Jiujiang Ã— Hastily Builds Fortifications; Ã— Boat Spies on Gaoming Estuary and Opens Fire, Causing Disturbances; Shelling of Tangxia Destroys More Than Twenty Civilian Houses

(West River Express Report) The Ã— army entrenched in Jiujiang in the lower reaches of the West River, repeatedly plots and its ambition is extremely strong. In recent days, it has again harassed the territory of Gaoming and Heshan counties on the south bank of the West River. However, our strength is strong and our defenses are strict, so the Ã— army has not taken any special actions.

Reinforcements to Jiujiang

According to military reports from the front, the Jiang-Fo Highway has seen frequent Ã— transports recently, with military vehicles traveling back and forth even late at night. It is suspected that the Ã— army is reinforcing Jiujiang from Guangzhou and Foshan. From last month until now, the Ã— army in Jiujiang has increased to a total of 2,000 men. Its units, including the Katano and Takeguchi Village units, are stationed in the Daxu, Shakou, and Heqing areas. On the 4th, over a hundred men were sent to Taiping Xiaxu to garrison, and they are hastily building defensive fortifications, erecting barbed wire, etc., for unclear purposes.

Spying on the Estuary

On the same day, several Ã— military motorboats from Heqing Ã— army patrolled and spied on the Gaoming estuary area in the evening for about 30 minutes. About 30 minutes later, one of the motorboats sailed near the Shiqi Pagoda and rapidly fired dozens of rounds with machine guns at the shore. At the same time, it used searchlights to probe in all directions. Our defending troops, upon receiving the report, believed that the Ã— army was conducting reconnaissance and harassment, so they only strengthened their defenses and did not respond. At about 7 o'clock, those several Ã— boats then sailed towards the Jiujiang Shakou area.

Shelling Heshan Territory

Moreover, the Jiujiang Ã— army, in order to threaten the south bank of the West River, frequently fired shells at the coastal areas of Heshan to create a false impression of strength. It was found that on the morning of the 5th, a Ã— shallow-water warship anchored at Shakou moved downstream and bombarded the villages near the coast of Tangxia, firing dozens of rounds in a row, destroying more than twenty of our civilian houses. The artillery at the Shakou ferry also fired remotely at the Gubut estuary on the afternoon of the same day, intermittently for about thirty minutes, before stopping. After an investigation, there were no casualties on our side, and no shells landed in our area. It was found that the shells fired by the Ã— forces were not live ammunition, but were intended to intimidate and create a false impression of strength.

### Shantou City is Calm; The Shantou Branch of the Bank Has Moved to Chao'an to Operate

(Shantou Express Report) The situation in Shantou City has been quite tense in recent days. Political and military organs are making wartime preparations. The police station has been working overtime to strictly guard against traitors and spies. However, Ã— planes constantly pass through the area to reconnoiter various coastal areas. Due to the frequent air raid alarms, the people are inevitably somewhat restless. The public order in the city remains good. It has been verified that there has been no increase or decrease in the number of Ã— warships in the Shantou sea, only five. In addition, there are about ten armed fishing boats. The Ã— warships are constantly moving, patrolling Jiao Island and Nanao. The transit transport ships have not docked. The Bank of Communications and the Central Bank had prepared everything a month ago and believed that it was necessary to relocate important items. The Shantou Branch of the Guangdong Provincial Bank has recently moved to Chao'an to operate, following the original plan. As of 4:00 PM on the 7th, Shantou City was as peaceful as usual.

### Establishment of a Provincial Wireless Network is Being Planned

[Shaoguan Express Report] Since Commissioner Zhu Hui took over as head of the Construction Department, he has been actively planning and carrying out various construction projects in Guangdong Province. He now believes that wartime rear transportation is of paramount importance. In addition to stepping up the consolidation of the province's highway trunk lines and long-distance telephone communications, he also plans to establish a province-wide wireless network so that even after the Ã— people destroy our transportation, we can still use wireless communication to transmit messages. A large number of wireless equipment has been purchased, and wireless stations will be set up in various counties and cities in the future to ensure flexible communication.

### We and the Ã— Engage in Artillery Battles in Meishan; Ã— Cavalry Suffers a Major Defeat in Mulang; Ã— Planes Spy on Muzhou

(Zhongshan Express Report) The Jiang-Yu war has been deadlocked for many days. According to military reports from here yesterday, there were minor engagements on all fronts on the 6th, but no major battles. It is now known that the majority of the Ã— army is concentrated in the Ximen area of Hui City and the Qicha area. Our artillery near Daxiaomeishan engaged in artillery battles with the Ã— forces in the suburbs of Hui City on the morning of the 6th, which ceased at noon. On the afternoon of the 6th, the Ã— forces in Jiangmen sent dozens of cavalrymen to launch a surprise attack on our positions along the Xinhe Road. They were intercepted by our army near Mulang. Our army was extremely brave and engaged the Ã— in close combat with broadswords. More than ten Ã— soldiers were killed, and the invading Ã— forces were defeated. The puppet "Advancement Corps" captured in Muzhou, Xinsha, and other places are now being interrogated separately and sent to a certain place for custody, preparing to find ways to reform them. As for the puppet "Advancement Corps" commander Zhao Shanzhan and chief of staff Li Xinyong, after thorough interrogation, it was approved yesterday by the Fourth War Zone to execute them by firing squad nearby. Also, at 2:00 PM on the 5th, the Ã— plane that crashed in Jiuzisha, Sanjiang, crashed because it was taking aerial photographs and flying too low, and was hit by our army and caught fire. After crashing, the bombs carried by the plane exploded, destroying the entire aircraft. The four Ã— pilots were killed in the plane, their bodies torn apart, a terrible sight. It was reported that on the 6th, Ã— planes were again discovered flying to spy on Zhou, Sanjiang, Yangwei, Xinsha, and other places.

### We are Advancing on Zengcheng, East River; Fierce Battle Unfolds at Shetouling; The Ã— Army is Shaken and a Breakthrough is Not Difficult; Dan Rongpei's Troops Successfully Attack the Ã— Camp in Shitan

(Dongjiang Express Report) Since our army launched its second attack on Zengcheng and recovered Fuhe, the connection between the Northeast Jiang Ã— army has been cut off. The Ã— forces trapped in Zengcheng are surrounded and attacked by our Northeast armies. The strike force of the Lin Division of the Twelfth Army Group, on the 3rd, joined forces with the Chen Shuying Regiment, which guards the foot of Mount Luofu, and launched another attack on Zengcheng, which was very successful. They engaged in fierce battles with the Ã— forces at Shetouling, Pingfengling, and Lixiao'ao in the vicinity of Zengcheng. Our army used new mechanized artillery as the vanguard to bombard the Ã— positions and cover the infantry's charge. The Ã— forces stubbornly resisted in their defensive positions, and the battle situation was quite fierce. After a stalemate until the morning of the 4th, dozens of Ã— officers and soldiers were killed. The battle is still evolving, but the Ã— forces are already exhausted, the Shetouling position is shaken, and it will not be difficult for us to break through in one fell swoop. Recently, military vehicles of the Ã— army have been traveling back and forth frequently between Guangzhou and Zengcheng, but our guerrilla forces are also active, assisting the regular army in attacking. At noon on the 4th, six military vehicles of the Ã— army, carrying over two hundred Ã— soldiers, were traveling from Longyandong to Beikeng when they suddenly hit a landmine planted by our guerrilla forces near Dabu. With a loud bang, the Ã— vehicles were overturned, and dozens of Ã— soldiers' limbs were scattered in the air, their flesh and blood blurred. The remaining Ã— forces, seeing this, did not dare to advance and retreated in a panic. In this battle, in addition to dozens of Ã— being killed or wounded, two Ã— vehicles were also destroyed.

Also, the First Brigade of Zengcheng Guerrillas, led by Dan Rongpei, has been active along the Guang-Jiu Railway in the areas of Xian, Shitan, and Yao, repeatedly inflicting damage on the Ã—. In the early morning of the 5th, more than a hundred guerrillas from Dan's brigade suddenly attacked the Ã— camp in Shitan, rushing into the vicinity of the Zenntan Station in the northeast suburbs and throwing handmade grenades at the Ã— camp. The Ã— soldiers woke up and responded in a panic, and a melee ensued. After fighting each other for half an hour, we achieved our objective and retreated while fighting, dispersing into smaller groups. In this battle, more than ten Ã— soldiers were killed, two long guns were captured, and a Ã— armored vehicle parked at the station was destroyed.

### Xiang Hanping Inspects Bao'an

[Shenzhen Express Report] It is confirmed that General Xiang Hanping, commander-in-chief of the guerrillas, is touring various counties in the East River, inspecting the guerrilla warfare situation in various counties, and strengthening the guerrilla formations in various counties.

### Cholera Epidemic Raging; Numerous Deaths Among Guangdong Ã— Forces; The Defense Force in Humen is Weak

[Dongguan Express Report] According to people from Humen, there is a severe cholera epidemic among the Guangdong Ã— forces, and many Ã— officers and soldiers have died. In addition, the Guangdong Ã— forces have been losing on all fronts recently, and there have been many casualties, so the Ã— army is very panic-stricken and has transferred rear-area troops to the front lines to fight. The number of troops defending Humen is now less than a company.

### The Image Transmitter in America

â€” Hua Zhi

Major Cities Set Up Image Transmission Stations

The movement for radio image transmission has been promoted for a long time and has finally been concretely realized in the United States. There are currently twelve cities in the United States that have established image transmission stations to broadcast various programs. There are also as many as six factories manufacturing image transmitters. Its popularity among families is increasing day by day, and it is expected that it will soon eliminate ordinary radios.

The so-called image transmitter is shaped like a floor-standing receiver. The radio antenna is stretched on the roof with fifty feet of copper wire. However, the image transmitter needs to set up a large awning. There is a piece of glass in front of the machine, seven and a half inches long and ten inches wide. There is a gourd-shaped cathode tube on the side. Electrons are emitted from the tube and projected onto the glass to form shadows.

When turning on the machine, the room must be dark. The two buttons on the machine control the sound and adjust the aperture. This refers to the most complete type, which sells for 350 US dollars. There is also a type with images but no sound, which is only worth 125 US dollars. Although the projected scenes are not large, they are very clear. Five or six people sitting three or four feet away from the machine can see them very satisfactorily.

The programs in the image transmitter focus on the latest news events, such as the British Emperor's tour of Canada, or changes occurring somewhere on Earth, etc. Either the scenes taken at that time are broadcast, or the news events are narrated using "performance" methods. Secondly, there are sports and recreational programs, and interesting scripts are also the center of broadcasting, such as the Sherlock Holmes detective stories. Sometimes, scenes are also broadcast on airplanes, making people feel as if they are traveling in the sky.

The cost of the image transmission station is very high because just one act of a script requires many set-decorated darkrooms and many technician man-hours. The British broadcast station currently broadcasts programs for one hour a day, and the government subsidizes a total of about one million yuan per year. In the United States, each station broadcasts images for two hours a week, and the expenses are borne by the merchants themselves. They expect to earn back the advertising expenses after they develop in the future. However, because the technology is still underdeveloped, the transmission range of radio image transmission is only 45 miles. It must be improved in the future to be popularized.

The technicians on the image broadcasting station are specially trained. They are different from those on the silver screen and stage because a film or stage play can be done for a year, while image transmission shows are no longer used after being broadcast once, and they need to continuously provide new tricks. Therefore, the development of radio image transmission provides people with new stimulation and also enters a new era in art.

### The Shanghai Silver Sea Style is the Most Online

Yi Hua's Fang Peilin directed and acted in "Three-Episode Incarnation of a Woman". The entire project has been completed. Yuan Meiyun appears in this episode as a jockey, which is very lively. Han Langan and Guan Hongda massage Wang Yang, performing a fragrant and humorous scene that makes people laugh. This film will be released soon.

Tiansheng Company produced "Red Flower Vase," a masterpiece by senior director Zhang Shichuan. The plot is extremely bitter and thorough. The actors include Wang Lan, Shu Shi, Wang Hanlun, Tan Zhiyuan, Bai Yan, etc.

Sun Jingjin, Yi Hua's director, directed "Hong Kong Songstress," which shows great effort. Sun Jing is a new director who loves to use new talents, such as Yue Lin, Tao Na, Yan Hua, Cao E, all of whom are new to the film industry.

Wang Yuanlong, who wrote, directed, and starred in "Swallow Thief," has reached the end. There are rumors that he will go to Hong Kong, but Wang himself said that he will not leave Shanghai in the short term because Xinhua has invited him to guest star in a film.

Wang Hanlun is a pioneer among Chinese film actresses, with rich acting experience. She plays Wang Lan's mother, a high-ranking official's wife who has been reduced to a servant, in the film "Red Flower Vase." Her performance is full of tears and emotion, worthy of being a senior filmmaker.

Wang Lan, who starred in "Red Flower Vase One," is seventeen years old this year and sings Peking opera very well.

Zhang Cuihong refused to play "Wang Baochuan". Yi Hua has invited Bai Yan to fill the role. There are rumors that LÃ¼ Baiyang will come to Shanghai.

Wang Yang has been very active recently, showing a great determination to move forward, which is commendable.

Yan Yuexian's younger sister, Yueleng, will have a stunning performance in Zheng Xiaoqiu's "One Night Pearl."

Rumors have spread that Wang Xianqi's wife is heavily pregnant, but in reality, Wang's wife's belly has not changed at all.

### All Countries Attach Great Importance to Children's Films

Film has been recognized as a quick way to supplement children's education. Therefore, countries around the world currently attach great importance to children's films. The fourth of this month is Children's Day. Therefore, the author would like to briefly report to readers on the importance that various countries attach to children's films.

America

The United States is an advanced country in the film industry. Therefore, film education in the United States is also more advanced than in any other country. Many schools in the United States now have projection equipment and screen children's films every Sunday or holiday. Some of these films are specially filmed by the government collecting materials and writing scripts. Some are filmed by film companies, specifically for schools or educational institutions to screen. Even ordinary cinemas screen films with educational significance for children. Whenever children go to watch them, the ticket prices are greatly reduced.

England

In traditional and somewhat conservative old England, movies are naturally no exception, especially when it comes to children's movies. When examining movies, the film censorship committees in various places mark each film with either an "A" or a "U". "A" is an abbreviation for "Adult," meaning only adults are allowed to watch, not children. "U" is an abbreviation for "Universal," meaning adults and children can both watch. In recent years, the UK has set up a national agency to manage children's films, filming children's films and showing them publicly in public institutions or schools in various places.

Germany and Italy

The two authoritarian countries of Germany and Italy also attach great importance to children's films. However, since the rise of the Fascists, these two countries have successively put the film industry under control, and movies have been used as a tool for propaganda. Political function outweighs entertainment, so children's films are no exception. The government selects the materials for children's films and films them, some explicitly and some implicitly, to promote Fascism, National Socialism, and child propaganda. And various movie theaters and schools often have public screenings of these children's films.

Soviet Union

The progress of the Soviet film industry is extraordinarily rapid, which is enough to surprise anyone. In particular, they pay great attention to film education. Just in Moscow, every holiday, there are more than 500 cinemas that take turns showing children's films from 9 am to 9 pm. The low ticket prices are unseen in other countries. These films, including full-length films and cartoons, are produced by the government and specifically for children ages 8 to 16 to watch. In terms of production, the stories are all aimed at children, which is different from ordinary films.

### South China Moves to Haiphong; Draws 2-2 with Combined Team; Cheuk Shek-kam, Ill, Returned to Hong Kong by Plane Yesterday for Recuperation; Song Ling-shing Invited to Join the Military in Haiphong

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The South China football team, on its southern tour, arrived in Hanoi and fought two battles with local teams, both of which South China won decisively with scores of 6-0. On the 5th, they moved to Haiphong and faced a combined team. South China invited Song Ling-shing (a star player from Hong Kong's Eastern Athletic Association, who went to Haiphong for work at the end of this football season at the urging of friends) to play. However, because the formation was not complete, they drew with the Haiphong combined team, the result being 2-2.

Cheuk Shek-kam was favored by Manager Mok and included in the team. However, Cheuk felt unwell when departing. Upon arriving in Hanoi, his condition did not improve. Therefore, Manager Mok, for the sake of his personal health, ordered him to return to Hong Kong for recuperation. He arrived in Hong Kong by plane yesterday.

A certain player, using the pseudonym "Heroic Wind," wrote a Southern Tour Diary for this newspaper, which was sent by air mail yesterday. Those who care about the team's southern tour will surely enjoy reading it.

Sailing Out of Port - Great Winds and Waves

At 5:30 PM on May 31st, the Guangdong motorship left Hong Kong. The weather was overcast, with hazy rain and misty fog. Hurricane waves surged, and the ship rocked unsteadily. The comrades had a light meal and then went to their cabins to rest. Manager Mok received a notice from the ship's captain, informing him that the winds and waves would be severe that night, so he instructed all the players to rest early. The scheduled calisthenics exercises for that day were canceled due to the rough seas. Although some comrades had accompanied the team on southern expeditions many times, they still felt overwhelmed by the large waves. Tiger Balm and Pak Kwa Tan became their only companions on the journey.

Calm Seas and Cheerful Conversations

At dawn on June 1st, the comrades got up. The sun shone brightly, and the weather was hot. The huge waves of yesterday were nowhere to be seen. The comrades' spirits were lifted, and they engaged in cheerful conversations. They gathered in the smoking room to chat. Tang Kwong-sam and Kwok Ying-ki sang Cantonese tunes. Others played chess. Chan Chun-fai's outer clothing was soiled, leaving him with only his underwear and long sleeves. Because he was traveling with the army, he had nothing but what he wore. He hoped to arrive in Haiphong soon to buy new clothes and pants. If his teammates refused to lend him clothing, Chan Chun-fai would be forced to practice nudism. Fortunately, the ship would arrive in Haiphong tomorrow, and everything should be resolved. The teammates agreed to go to bed early that night to wake up early and watch the ship dock.

Shek-kam Returns to Hong Kong, Ling-shing Joins the Expedition

After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Haiphong became a vital transportation hub for our country, with thriving commerce and a surge in population. Last year, the Eastern Athletic Association and the South Pen Club football teams also visited here. On the 2nd, at six in the morning, everyone prepared their luggage. The ship docked at 7:30 AM. After customs inspection, the entire team went to the Ho Shek Mei Hotel for a brief rest. At noon, they had lunch at the Tao Yuan Restaurant. Compatriots gave the team a warm welcome. After lunch, the team, in response to an invitation from the Hanoi Football Association, had to travel directly to Hanoi on the Messi Ling express train at 1:30 PM for the first match on the 3rd. Coincidentally, Song Ling-shing, a star player from Hong Kong's Eastern Athletic Association, visited Haiphong. Coach Mok strongly invited Song to join the expedition. Song agreed and immediately went to Hanoi with the team. Upon arriving in Hanoi, we stayed at the Grand World Hotel. As instructed by Coach Mok, everyone rested at 10 PM. Those who disobeyed would be severely punished. Cheuk Shek-kam fell ill upon leaving Hong Kong, and his condition did not improve during the voyage. After being sick for seven days, for the sake of his health, it was decided that Cheuk would take a plane back to Hong Kong for recuperation. However, the southern expedition team gained one Song and lost one Cheuk, so there was no loss in overall strength.

First Match in Hanoi - Showing Off Power

The 3rd was the date of the first match of the southern expedition in Hanoi. The match location was at the Racecourse Stadium. The opponent was the Hanoi champion Alan team, a strong team in Hanoi. The match began at 5 PM. Before 5 PM, the audience was extremely crowded, especially with overseas Chinese. Our team fielded a complete lineup and, as a result, showed off its power with a 6-0 victory.

Pak Ka-ping

Lee Tin-sang Hau Yung-sang

Lee Kwok-wai Wing Chiu Kwok Ying-ki

Law Tau-man Lai Siu-wing Chan Tak-fai Fung King-cheung Yeung Shui-yik

Another Victory - Crushing the Combined Team

On the 4th, we fought the Hanoi Athletes team. Because the overseas Chinese were impressed by our team's reputation, the audience was twice as large as yesterday. We played with a heroic attitude and again crushed the Hanoi Athletes team with a score of 6-0. Our team's lineup was as follows:

Cheung Wing-choi

Lee Tin-sang Hau Yung-sang

Lee Kwok-wai Leung Wing-chiu Kwok Ying-ki

Law Tau-man Lai Siu-wing Chan Tak-fai Fung King-cheung Tang Kwong-sam

Moving to Haiphong - The Game Ends in a Draw

On the 5th, in response to a telegram from the Haiphong Athletes team, we traveled by car to Haiphong for the match. The stadium was uneven, the dimensions were not standard, and the grass was five to six inches long. Coach Mok tried a new formation, with Shui-yik playing on the left wing and Tin-sang resting. The lineup was incomplete, and the game ended in a 2-2 draw. We will take a train to West Buy at 5 PM on the 6th and will arrive in about 40 hours. Strong Vietnamese teams are ahead, and there will be intense battles. The lineup for the match against the Haiphong team was as follows:

Cheung Wing-choi

Lee Kwok-wai Hau Yung-sang

Tam Chun-fai Lau Hing-choi Song Ying-shing

Yeung Shui-yik Lai Siu-wing Fung King-cheung Lau Chung-sang Tang Kwong-sam

### Division B Basketball: International, Chun Fung, and Lai Hang Victorious

The Division B basketball finals had three games scheduled last night. In the first game, International defeated Wah Hung 36-22. In the second game, Chun Fung won by one free throw, 29-28, over Tsang Ying. In the last game, Lai Hang played against Kwong Chung. Initially, Lai Hang did not go all out and was closely followed by Kwong Chung. After halftime, Lam Yau-pui and Tak Tak-cheung and others displayed brilliant performances, and Kwong Chung became like a spirit under the ax. As a result, Lai Hang won overwhelmingly 59-32. Also, the Basketball Association announced that in the Chun Fung vs. Pui Ying game, the committee members discovered that Chun Fung had used an unregistered player. Therefore, an emergency meeting was convened, and the outcome of that game is currently pending, awaiting the referee's report before a meeting can be held to make a decision.

### From Ancient Greece to the Olympic Games

Introduction

Greece is the birthplace of European culture. All European religions, arts, philosophies, educations, crafts, sciences, etc., are influenced by the Greeks. This is related to geography. If you open a map of Europe, you will see that Greece is only half an island. Its shape is like the bones of a hand, protruding into the Mediterranean Sea, giving the impression of picking up seeds of various cultures. To the north, the Balkans act as an arm, which is slightly wider, while mainland Greece is only two hundred and fifty miles from north to south and one hundred and eighty miles from east to west, with a total area of â€‹â€‹only about 20,000 square miles. However, because it is surrounded by the sea on three sides, the climate in all seasons is very mild. Taking the city of Athens as an example, it only snows once every twenty years. Every year from May to September, citizens can sleep outdoors on the streets. Therefore, houses, furniture, and clothing are very simple and unadorned. As for daily life such as farming and labor, most slaves are made to do it, so their education does not necessarily require vocational preparation. Therefore, in a beautiful, purple-sea environment where life is very comfortable, Greeks enjoy a life of beauty. It is not only the center of Greek life, The Ounter P infs of Greek Life, but also the foundation of Greek culture. However, its great cultural development lagged behind the Persian Wars. Afterwards, because they had confidence, they dared to try to explain naturally what was previously attributed to mythology. Therefore, Aristotle Srisotle said, "Since the Persian Wars, people have been proud of their success and rushed forward. All knowledge is a field of activity, and they want to pursue deeper learning." However, although the Persian Wars were the driving force behind the formation of Greek culture, the completion of culture was still blessed by geography. Looking at the map again, the coastline of Greece is quite tortuous. Although there are no high mountains or large rivers, there are many small mountains running vertically and horizontally. Therefore, the terrain is very uneven, sometimes forming mountains and sometimes forming hills. These vertical and horizontal mountains create obstacles, dividing Greece into many isolated regions. In each region, it develops its self-sufficient economic life, independent ruling government, and even different systems, educations, laws, and customs. Each region has two opposing cities, surrounded by cultivated land attached to the city, expanding to the surrounding hillsides. This type of region is called a "city-state," Citg Ates.

These include Euboea, Loerio, Aetolia, Phocts, Boeotia, Achaea, Argolio, Eli, Aroiada, Meceoia, and Lnconiu. Its city is called Sparta Sbunta. There is also Attica AJicn, whose city is called Athens Asbens. Although these many city-states each develop their politics and economy, they compete with each other and are unwilling to give in. Fortunately, they contain a sense of ethnic self-awareness, organize a common religious alliance Amphictiony, and in order to protect temples and worship gods, they launched the Olympic Olympi Games to connect with each other. The above is a brief overview of Greek culture. The following is a description of Sparta and Athens, the hegemons among the allied states.

### China's Cotton Industry Since the War Began

(Translated from Millard's Review) Birmingham (Continued)

(9) Textile factories that were closed during the war but have resumed operations since last year include: Chongxin in Zhabei, registered under British business, and Ewo Yarns in Yangshupu District, British owned.

(10) The following textile factories whose machinery has reportedly been shipped out by the Japanese include: Hengfeng Textile Company, Shenxin Yarn Factory No. 7, registered under British business, Dihua Dyeing and Weaving Company, all located in Yangshupu, and Zhentai Yarn Factory in Zhabei, also registered under British business.

(11) The following companies were opened in Shanghai after the war began: Anda Textile Company, 15,000 spindles, China Textile Company, 26,000 spindles, 300 looms, China Yarn Factory, 15,000 spindles (all registered under British business), China Cotton Yarn Manufacturing Company, 26,000 spindles, Defeng Textile Company, 10,340 spindles, 128 looms (all registered under American business), Rong Yu Yarn Factory, 10,000 spindles, Hefeng Weaving and Spinning Company, 5,000 spindles, 150 looms, Xinsheng Yarn Factory, 10,360 spindles, Zhaoxing Yarn Factory, 8,400 spindles, Da Yu Dyeing and Weaving Factory, China Woolen Company, 4,000 woolen spindles, 100 looms.

The machinery of the above factories was either shipped out from inland cities such as Wuxi or purchased and transferred from other textile factories in our area.

Before the war, Japan had 45 yarn factories in China, 32 of which were in Shanghai. It is said that about 7 million spindles in the two factories in Shanghai and the nine factories in Qingdao were destroyed in the war. In order to increase the output of its yarn factories, the Japanese side has decided to install 900,000 spindles in Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai in the near future. Currently, 25 of the 32 Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai are in operation, and most of their products are dumped into occupied areas. (To be continued)

### Intellectual Debate

â€” Jin Ming

(I)

Sitting halfway up the mountain under a pine tree, inhaling a Douiee Fagle brought from a town ninety miles away, I intend to discuss some trivial matters. Yinglin said:

"...One day, we may be sitting here again, starving to death. Our ancestors didn't leave us anything suitable; it's especially miserable for the intellectuals. Farmers can grow grain, ranchers can manage some cattle and sheep, soldiers can carry weapons, but everyone else will inevitably suffer the same poor fate. The legacy of us intellectuals is not enough to console ourselves. We might as well look at the scenery."

I felt I had nothing to answer. Neither wanting to die nor wanting to live, this is a major flaw in people. Such thinking can only be considered "defeatism" worth less than half a penny, even if such days are indeed possible.

The cultural legacy our ancestors left us, not to mention anything else, is just words, the art of debate, which is enough to inspire people without weapons or resources that their existence is not without meaning. In ancient times, European orators like Demosthenes and Cicero had only one mouth when they were alive, and their legacy after death was just some glory, but their spiritual achievements never ceased, because the so-called 'Creator' intentionally arranged humanity in this way. Humanity itself is also willing to present its final glory to such people, and all they can hope for is this right.

I think, when war destroys everything, destroying all published culture, intellectuals will still hope for a way to "live," leaving the pen and still having a mouth.

In today's society, with the distribution and arrangement of socio-economic thought and material, the mouth probably doesn't have much use. The compassion of citizens and the sympathy of knights in the days of ancient emperors no longer exist. It is impossible to stir up great waves with just a mouth. But compromising and assessing situations, weighing gains and losses, advocating benevolence and criticizing injustice, using strategy and understanding plansâ€”these slightly corrective efforts against absurdities and barbarism will still continue in the modern age and the future. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* of Qi and Lu record that Wu Zixu met King Liao of Wu, and Liao talked with him for two days, "his words were without repetition," which shows that Wu Zixu still had a mouth even after leaving his weapons. Even when words couldn't move him, he still had wisdom to help HelÃ¼ achieve his ambition.

The *Poetry Beyond the Tradition* records that Confucius spoke about the art of persuasion with some meaning. Regardless of whether the words truly came from the Wang Ma Zi Old Shop, the fact that the ancestors told their descendants to learn "literature" so that they could live meaningfully is worth appreciating. He believed: "In the art of persuasion, maintain solemnity and dignity, act with integrity and sincerity, stand strong and firm, use apt metaphors, clarify with distinctions, send it forth with joyful fragranceâ€¦ this ensures that persuasion will always succeed." It seems that such a skillful mouth doesn't necessarily rely on some genius; it is originally obtained through self-cultivation.

(II)

Speaking of the skill of argument, many praise Yan Ying. Yan Ying was not as pedantic as the Confucians, nor was he solely focused on power like Su Qin and Zhang Yi.

"Duke Jing of Qi sent Yanzi as an envoy south to Chu. The King of Chu heard of this... His attendants said, 'Yanzi is the most skilled debater in the world. Discussing state affairs with him would be inadvisable. Your Majesty could sit with Yanzi, have an official lead a man from Qi past Your Majesty, and when Your Majesty asks about him, have him say the Qi man is a habitual thief and is being bound for that reason. This should be able to embarrass him.' The King said, 'Good.'... After a while, they led a bound prisoner past. The King said, 'What did he do?' The official replied, 'He is a Qi man who is a habitual thief, and he is being brought to the authorities.' The King laughed heartily and said, 'Qi is a land of hats and belts, a land of scholars. Are they truly prone to thievery?' Yanzi said, '...Has Your Majesty not seen the trees south of the Yangtze? They are called tangerine trees. When planted north of the Yangtze, they transform into trifoliate oranges. Why? It is the soil that makes them so. When the Duke was in Qi, he stood erect in his hat and belt, with the integrity of Boyi; now that he is in Chu, he is prone to wickedness. It must be the transformation caused by the soil!'"

This story is well known, but it is worth savoring again and again. Here are two more examples:

"Duke Jing of Qi was touring atop Niu Mountain, looking north at Qi, and said, 'How beautiful is my state! Lush Mount Tai! If there were no death in ancient times, where would I, the lonely one, go?' He lowered his head and wept, wetting his lapel. State Counselor Gaozi said, 'Indeed. I rely on your Majesty's bounty to be able to eat coarse vegetables and bad meat, and to ride a decrepit horse in a wooden cart, and I still do not wish to die, let alone Your Majesty!' Yanzi said, 'How joyful is my tour today. I see a cowardly ruler and two flattering ministers. If there were no death in ancient times, the Grand Duke would still be alive, and my ruler would now be wearing a straw hat and cloak, standing in the fields, concerned only with worries, with no time to think of death!'"

"Duke Jing of Qi went out hunting at the pool of Zhaohua. Yan Denzhu was in charge of the birds, and one escaped. Duke Jing was furious and wanted to kill him. Yanzi said, 'Deng Ju has four capital offenses. Please let me count them and then execute him.' Duke Jing said, 'Agreed.' Yanzi said, 'Deng Ju was in charge of the birds for our ruler, and one escaped. That is his first offense; for causing our ruler to kill a man over a bird, that is his second offense; for causing the feudal lords of the four kingdoms to hear of it and think that our ruler values birds more than scholars, that is his third offense; when the Son of Heaven hears of it, he will surely demote our ruler, endanger his state, and cut off his ancestral temples, that is his fourth offense. These four offenses deserve death without pardon. I ask to increase his punishment.' Duke Jing said, 'Stop. This is also my fault. I wish for you to apologize on my behalf.'"

Such "intellectual debate" can be said to be truly humorous, much more humorous than the impromptu utterances of Yuan Zhonglang. Of course, in an era of materialism, literary intellectuals disdain the subservient status of the past and therefore despise this kind of debating skill, which is a joke. At the very least, scholars can never be separated from social life.

During the Tang Dynasty, Han Yu quelled an impending internal rebellion with a clever debate. The unwavering words of Kou Zhun in the Song Dynasty forced the northern barbarians to give up their invasion. These are all effective examples of debating in defense, even though the effects are not always guaranteed, the art of debate itself is still worth appreciating.

### Five Minutes (III)

â€” Luo Feng

He Zheng's legs were a little weak, and he timidly moved his heavy feet backward. The shackles suddenly rang, and the sound reminded himâ€”cowardice and avoidance, aren't they just foolish self-deception? At the same time, he thought that under such circumstances, it was absolutely impossible to escape death. Now he even felt that being able to die sooner would be his victory.

One of his hands had already touched the fur of that beast. The fur was short and stiff. He Zheng thought: Tiger? Bear? Why hasn't it made a move yet? Is it asleep? Then he waved his fists wildly, trying to wake it up, accidentally hitting it on the head. Only then did he realize that it was neither a tiger nor a bear, but a horse.

Because of this horse, He Zheng once again had the illusion of escape: lying on the horse's back or sitting sideways, he could ride it to break through the enemy's blockade, escape this barren mountain, and return to his own troops safely...

The horse kept snorting.

Two guards patrolled outside the stable.

He Zheng stood blankly in place, indulging in his fantasy. However, that fantasy just kept rolling around in his heart, rolling around... never getting close to his ideal.

Suddenly, a strong, unsteady beam of light shot in from outside, dividing into countless white, thick lines by the sparse supports of the stable, sometimes landing on He Zheng, sometimes on the horse, or on the ground.

At this moment, the two guards had stopped patrolling. A lighter step replaced their footsteps, seeming to gradually intensify with the increasing light.

Now He Zheng had stopped his unrealistic fantasy. He completely understood what was coming. He wanted to greet it, but his whole body was too heavy to move a step. So, he had no choice but to offer his young life, waiting for it to seize him.

The large beam of the flashlight completely enveloped him, turning He Zheng into a blind man, unable to see anything. He could only hear the hurried, ruthless tone of the enemy commander, followed by the interpreter's words:

"Have you considered it?"

If not for this reminder, He Zheng would have almost forgotten it.

Within these five minutes, he had considered nothing at all, except for that bit of fantasy about escaping, and was only praying for death, as if only death could bring him supreme comfort.

He Zheng didn't answer the insulting question. He raised his head and walked proudly toward the strong light. Golden symbols flaunted on his bright collar badges. The interpreter translated the commander's words:

"The time has come!"

"Yes, I've been waiting for a long time!"

### From the Old Method of Praising to Criticism

â€” Xiaoren

Our usual flatterers always have an old method: they seize on a seemingly good point of the person they are praising and greatly exaggerate it, making people think that this is the entirety of their life's behavior. In the past, those who wrote "epitaphs" and "prefaces" for people played this trick. If the person occasionally gave a poor person a tattered piece of clothing, the flatterer would praise them as a great philanthropist, even though they were actually a parent who had beaten a servant girl to death; if there was a couplet written by someone hanging in their living room, the flatterer would call them "learned," even though they had never actually read a book in their life; even if they had only hired a doctor for their wife once, the flatterer would exaggerate that they had "extremely harmonious relations with their wife," even though they kept seven or eight concubines.

This method is excellent for flattery, because otherwise, the purpose of "praising" would be difficult to achieve. However, this can only be used for "praising." If one were to formally write a critical biography of a person, this method would lead to major problems.

For example, Feng Dao once recited other people's poems in front of the Later Tang emperor to illustrate the hardships of the people's lives. This story is naturally "learned" and "charitable"; but if one only seizes on this point and considers it the entirety of Feng Dao's personality, completely ignoring his focus on holding office and disregard for the state's demise, what kind of critical biography would that be? Think about it! Take another example: Ruan Dacheng was a talented writer. He was not only one of the great playwrights but also an excellent director. His "learning" was without any pretense. But if one only seizes on this side of Ruan Dacheng, praising only his literary achievements while completely ignoring his act of surrendering to the Manchus, what kind of critical biography would that be? Think about it! The opposite would be the same: if one were to assume that Confucius was an expert in picking up women simply because he met Nanzi, that would undoubtedly be a great injustice. This all illustrates that to assess a person, one must look at their major tendencies and draw conclusions based on these tendencies in order to arrive at a definition that can be considered definitive. Similarly, one cannot escape this circle when doing literary criticism.

The Qing Dynasty painter Wang Su once painted a very good set of pictures on agriculture and weaving. That set of sequential pictures is very famous and can indeed be called one of Wang Su's masterpieces. But should we, based on this, say that Wang Su is a peasant painter? Of course not. Because Wang Su spent most of his life painting the ladies of the upper classes, and agriculture and weaving cannot represent his entire body of work. To critique a literary artist, one must also look at their major tendencies. Otherwise, their face will be distorted. Seeing a few short essays by a Ming Dynasty writer without investigating the author's main achievements and blindly promoting them as a "master of natural genius," even placing a halo on their head to use as a talisman when they are suffering, one can believe that some people will believe it, but in reality, it is just nonsense.

Even when criticizing a single work or essay, one cannot escape this circle.

However, our old method has long been extended to the field of criticism. The so-called "quoting out of context" refers to this type of criticism. One can simply tear off a piece from a work and launch into a tirade of discussion without bothering to study the entire work. This is naturally very enjoyable for the critic, but it is not very good for the work itself. Just by taking the passage about Ximen Qing and Pan Jinlian from the *Water Margin*, and labeling the *Water Margin* as "an obscene book," people who have not read the entire *Water Margin* may believe it, but in fact, the *Water Margin* has been "lingchi'd."

However, if this kind of criticism advances further, it becomes "extracting sentences and interpreting them." This is naturally even more enjoyable. One can simply extract a sentence or two from tens of thousands of words or thousands of words and then show off the critic's authority. The brilliance of the method goes without saying, but the result is that it becomes a word game. The critic paints a line of powder on their own nose, and Jin Shengtan used this method to critique the *Water Margin* and other so-called "genius books," but don't we also feel that Jin Shengtan often seems like a clown?

According to the literary evolutionary view advocated by our scholars, this "extracting sentences and interpreting them" will advance to "extracting words and interpreting them." By extracting a word like "no" from tens of thousands of words or thousands of words, one can label it as promoting nihilistic philosophy. By extracting an "alas" from tens of thousands of words or thousands of words, one can label it as expressing pessimism. When critics reach this stage, they have reached a state of complete and utter satisfaction, but "where there is a benefit, there must be a drawback." It is a pity that criticism is sacrificed to accommodate the critic's satisfaction and disappears.

### Rats

â€” Yide

If you want to read some books in peace and quiet at night, it's impossible with rats around. There's chattering and noises from the east and the west. Sometimes they even march on the ceiling! It's like "not hearing commands, but only the sound of men and horses moving."

If someone else were sleeping here, they would suspect a "ghost" and probably huddle in their blankets. But I've gotten used to it. I do my own thing because I know these are all the "petty tricks" of rats.

Rats are truly "philosophical" in their understanding of the world. One night, I don't know which child left a steamed bun, so I put it on a stool next to the bed, selected a wooden stick about a foot long, and held it in my hand, thinking that when the rat came, I would give it a "surprise attack." But it didn't work. It seemed to have the "spirit of a human being" and didn't come. When I was prepared, it didn't dare to act.

But humans are civilized. The rat paced back and forth on the desk, while I lay in bed, trying to imitate the roar and posture of a cat, jumping and leaping (actually, it wasn't my feet that were jumping). The bed creaked, but the rat, after all, didn't behave like a civilized person who "judges others by their own standards." "Ha! Trying to scare me?" it seemed to say with a smile, and then it slowly walked away.

Helpless, I had no choice but to put on a show, rubbing my fists and palms. In the cold weather, who wants to come out and meddle in other people's affairs? Isn't it better to sleep in bed? It's just a slight loss of food, and it's disturbing. And the most important thing to be aware of is "throwing something at the rat but fearing damaging the valuables," so I had to tolerate it.

However, this is talking about the past, because my old cat is giving birth to kittens, so she doesn't have the strength to catch rats, and the rats aren't afraid of her. They even dare to walk in and out of the cat's nest. Now our old cat and the newborn kittens are all roaring; many rats have been bitten to death, and they will soon disappear.

### Returning Dream

â€” Luo Pin

A boat travels on the river

Watching the rolling yellow waves

Lofty mountains and plains

Lining the river and sky

Last night I docked at Luokou

Listening to Shao's boat songs

Fishing boat lights on the riverbank like a camp

On the small path, drawn

A blue lantern

Gamblers go home drunk

Tonight I rest

By the ancient fortress at the foot of the mountain

In a midnight dream

I hear the rooster crow at dawn

The sound of clappers and pestles

A refugee's returning dream.
