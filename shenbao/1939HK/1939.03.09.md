### Where is the Soviet Union Heading? – On the Report of the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party

— Yan

The 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is scheduled to open tomorrow, March 10th. At a time when the international situation is undergoing dramatic changes, fascist aggressors are intensifying their efforts to advance a world war, and the peace front is actively seeking to consolidate and expand its power, the attitude and internal affairs of the Soviet Union, regarded as a pillar of world peace, are naturally attracting worldwide attention. This 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party will not only hear important reports on all aspects of the Soviet Communist Party but will also make decisions based on these reports that will affect the entire Union and even the world. Therefore, this Congress is of particular interest to the people of all countries. At this Congress, Soviet People's Commissar Chairman Molotov will present a report on the "Third Five-Year Plan" for the development of the Soviet national economy, while Zhdanov will present an "Outline for Revising the Party Constitution." The reports of both Molotov and Zhdanov are particularly noteworthy because they not only explain the recent internal affairs of the Soviet Union but also foreshadow its future trends. Chinese compatriots, who have been heroically resisting aggression for twenty months and are continuing to advance on the path of resisting aggression and building the nation, should naturally examine the internal affairs and trends of the friendly Soviet Union calmly, removing emotions and prejudices. This will not only prevent them from being confused by the rumors and heresies that are rampant in the city but will also enable them to gain a correct understanding of the prospects for our country's resistance and nation-building and the international situation, and to strengthen their confidence in victory.

(1) Report on the Third Five-Year Plan

Molotov's report on the "Third Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet National Economy" (1938-1942) was published in millions of Soviet newspapers on New Year's Day this year and sparked enthusiastic discussions among the working people of the country, gaining unanimous and sincere support. Molotov's report first pointed out the

Success of the Second Five-Year Plan

The successful completion of the Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan means that it has completed its main historical task of building a socialist state. It has eliminated all exploiting classes. It has eradicated all factors that could lead to the exploitation of man by man and the division of people into exploiters and the exploited. It has completed the most difficult task of the socialist revolution—agricultural collectivization. The collective farm system is now deeply rooted, and it has established the first stage of socialism. The victory of socialism has been concretely embodied in the new Soviet Constitution. By the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, socialist industry accounted for 98.7% of the total production funds in the country. Socialist production has completely controlled the entire national economy, reaching 99.8% of the total industrial output value, 98.6% of the total agricultural output value, and 100% of the total trade volume. In 1937, workers and staff employed in the socialist economy accounted for 34.7% of the national population, collective farmers and handicraftsmen united in handicraft cooperatives accounted for 55.5%, and soldiers, students, dependents, and others accounted for 43%. Therefore, 94.4% of the national population is directly engaged in the socialist economy or closely related to it. In addition,

The Complete Technical Transformation of the National Economy

was the main decisive task of the Second Five-Year Plan, and it has now been largely successful. In 1937, more than 80% of the total industrial output was produced by factories newly built or completely renovated during the First and Second Five-Year Plans. About 90% of all agricultural tractors and combine harvesters were manufactured in the Soviet Union during the Second Five-Year Plan. The Second Industrial Five-Year Plan was completed ahead of schedule in April 1937, in four years and three months. The railway transportation sector was completed in less than four years, and its performance exceeded the plan. In the agricultural sector, grain and cotton production also exceeded the plan. It is estimated that industrial production in 1937 increased by 120% compared to 1922, while the original plan was only 114%. Furthermore, during the Second Five-Year Plan period, annual industrial production increased by an average of 17.1%, while the original plan was only 16.7%. In particular, since the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan, all economic sectors have cultivated cadres capable of mastering new technologies. The greatest success is the emergence of important cadres among the Soviet intelligentsia and the bold promotion of new leading workers in all economic sectors, because regardless of whether these cadres are party members or non-party Bolsheviks, they are all necessary for all aspects of socialist construction. (This spirit is naturally even more worthy of encouragement in China today.) In particular, the Stakhanov movement vividly reflects the success of Soviet construction in mastering new technologies. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, labor productivity in large-scale industry increased by 82%, while the original plan was only 63%.

Improvement of Material and Cultural Standards

The task stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan, "to raise the material and cultural standards of the working class and to increase consumption by more than two times," has also been completed. The number of workers and staff in all sectors of the national economy increased by 17.6%. The average annual wage of workers and staff in 1937 increased by 113.5% compared to 1932. The state allocated funds for workers', peasants', cultural, and material services (education, health, etc.) increased from 44 billion to 140 billion rubles. Furthermore, the total income of collective farmers increased by 2.7 times in the four years from 1933 to 1937. The production of necessities in 1937 increased more than two times compared to 1932, and the total amount of state and cooperative trade increased more than five times. During the same period, a cultural revolution actually took place in the country. The number of primary and secondary school students increased from 21.3 million to 29.4 million, and the number of university students increased to 550,000. The progress of the material and cultural development of the peoples of the Soviet East was particularly rapid.

A New Stage for the Soviet Union

With the end of the Second Five-Year Plan and the beginning of the Third Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union has entered a new stage, completing the construction of a classless socialist society and gradually transitioning from socialism to communism. Molotov gave clear instructions regarding the tasks of this new stage:

In this stage, the communist education of the working people is of decisive importance. It must overcome the remnants of capitalism in the hearts of the people (communist builders). The Soviet Union has been transformed into an economically independent country, capable of providing its national economy and national defense with all the necessary technical equipment. The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of industrial growth rate. The shortcomings of the Soviet Union's total industrial output compared to the most advanced capitalist countries in terms of technology and economy must be completely eliminated so that communism can achieve final victory in the historical competition with capitalism. We are now able to, and must, take on the responsibility of completing the main economic tasks of the Soviet Union ourselves, catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in Europe and the United States in the economic field, and solving this problem in the near future. At the same time, in the new plan, we must promote the increase of national income and trade volume, so that the consumption of the masses can be increased by one and a half to two times. In further coordination with such major tasks, we must improve the cultural level of all working people in cities and rural areas, so that the cultural and technical level of the working class—the leading force at the forefront of socialism—advances to the level of engineers and technicians.

Molotov's report pointed out that the industrial and national economy have developed greatly during the second five-year plan period. It is now required to further develop unhindered in accordance with a fixed plan, especially under the conditions of imperialism intensifying its aggression and surrounding the Soviet Union. We must create large-scale national reserves, first of all regarding fuel, electricity, a part of international industry, and the development of the transportation industry.

Contents of the Third Five-Year Plan

How will the Soviet Union implement the new tasks of the current new stage in Molotov's report? The third five-year plan, in coordination with the above tasks, puts forward the following provisions:

Industrial Aspect

It stipulates that in 1942 (the last year of the third five-year plan), the total industrial output value of the Soviet Union should be 1.8 trillion rubles, an increase of 88% compared to 955 billion in 1937. Among them, the production of production tools will increase by 103%, and the production of consumer goods will increase by 69%. This year, Soviet industry should produce 1.4 million tons of automobiles, 750 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 230 million tons of coal, 54 million tons of oil, 22 million tons of pig iron, 27.7 million tons of steel, 21 million tons of rolled steel, and a total value of 134 billion rubles of chemical products. The output of the machine manufacturing industry should increase by 2.25 times. Increase coal production, so that it is not only sufficient for domestic needs, but also can establish national reserves; establish a new oil base "Second Baku" in the Volga River and Ural Mountains, and expand the gasification of various fuels, especially underground gasification of coal, so that it becomes an independent industry; According to the gasification method of hard fuel, create an artificial liquid fuel industry, first implement it in the east, and use artificial methods to turn gas into liquid fuel. Increase the total power generation of each power plant to 2.1 times, and transform the chemical industry into one of the main industrial sectors to meet the needs of the national economy and national defense. In addition, the third five-year plan should also be a chemical five-year plan. The production of the chemical industry should increase by 2.3 times. The iron and steel industry should also continue to increase production, so that the same plan also becomes a special five-year plan. The production of general consumer goods should increase by 1.7 times, industrial labor productivity should increase by 65%, and production costs should be reduced by 11%.

Agricultural Aspect

The total agricultural output value is stipulated to increase from 198 billion in 1937 to 302 billion rubles in 1942, an increase of 53%; At the same time. The average annual grain harvest is stipulated to increase from 550 million bushels during the second five-year plan period to 700 million bushels, an increase of 27%; By 1942, the harvest of industrial crops is stipulated to increase to 300 million quintals of sugar beets, 32.9 million quintals of cotton, and 8.5 million quintals of flax. Among livestock, horses will increase by 35%, cattle by 40%, pigs by 100%, sheep and goats by 10%. The mechanization of agricultural methods should also be thoroughly completed.

Transportation Aspect

In terms of transportation, railway freight transport is stipulated to increase from 355 billion ton-kilometers in 1937 to 510 billion ton-kilometers in 1942; River freight transport will increase from 33 billion ton-kilometers to 58 billion ton-kilometers. The railway will add 7,370 locomotives and 190,000 vehicles. 11,000 kilometers of new railways will be built, 8,000 kilometers of double-track railways will be laid, and 1,840 kilometers of railways will be electrified. The navigable waterways of inland rivers will be expanded from 101,000 kilometers to 115,000 kilometers. By the end of this plan, the Arctic Ocean route will become a regular navigable waterway, maintaining normal traffic with the Far East. Automobile transport will increase by 4.6 times, and 210,000 kilometers of highways will be built and renovated.

Other Aspects

In terms of talent, Molotov's report suggested training 104,000 various specialized technicians and 600,000 specialized talents who have received higher education.

Furthermore, the total value of capital construction within the third five-year plan is stipulated to be 1.8 trillion rubles (the second five-year plan was 1.15 trillion rubles), of which 1.033 trillion is for industry, 358 billion is for transportation, and 106 billion is for agriculture. The total value of new and renovated factories opened is 17.9 billion rubles. The total power generation of each power plant is increased, so that it is increased from 80 billion kilowatts to 172 billion kilowatts. Increase coal production by 1.7 times, steel plant production to 24 million tons, pig iron industry to 2.4 times, aluminum to 3.8 times, automobile industry to 2.4 times, and cotton industry to 1.5 times.

Especially Accelerate Construction in the Far East

What is particularly noteworthy in the Soviet Union's third five-year plan is the provision to especially accelerate construction in the Far East. Molotov's article stipulates: The capital construction and factory construction in the eastern and far eastern regions should be accelerated, and efforts should be made to develop the metallurgical industry in these regions, create a large textile industry in the east, and use cotton from Central Asia. Ensure the further economic and cultural development of national republics and provinces.

The large factories to be built during the third five-year plan are several heavy machine tool manufacturing plants, five turbine manufacturing plants, several small automobile manufacturing plants, and multiple new automobile assembly and freight automobile plants in Siberia and the Far East. Several spinning machine and weaving machine manufacturing plants. Start creating the world's largest construction project, two hydroelectric power plants in Kuibyshev, with a total of 3.4 million kilowatts. Start building the Kaluga Hydroelectric Power Plant, creating the Uglich, Rybinsk, Chirchik, Kanakir, Svir (two), Niva (two), Sudomi, and other hydroelectric power plants. Start building one hydroelectric power plant and 91 local thermal power plants. Develop several new mines with a total annual output of 150 million tons. Open several new oil refineries with a total capacity of 15 million tons and several refineries with a total capacity of 4.5 million tons. Complete the construction projects of the Magnitogorsk Steel Plant, Novaya Tagil, Petrovsk-Zabaikalsky, Zaporozhye Plant, and Azov Steel Plate Plant in the Amur River; Start building several new steel plants in the South Ural and East Siberia. Build an electric pole steel pipe plant in the Urals and a steel pipe plant in the central region. Build 20 new iron-smelting blast furnaces. In the non-ferrous industry, complete the construction of the Balesh Copper Plant and the Central Ural and Buryatia United Plant. Start building the Dzhezkazgan and Almalyk Copper Smelting Plants, and the Altai Lead and Zinc Smelting Plant. Open the Ural Lead Plant, the Kandalaksha and Rybinsk Lead Plant, and the South Ural and Northern Nickel Plant. Start building several new lead, zinc, tin, tungsten, and other plants. In the chemical industry, start building several new soda and sulfuric acid plants, 14 artificial rubber plants, 14 tire plants, 7 canvas plants, and 46 natural rubber plants, and two artificial liquid fuel plants.

Renovate Both Old and New Cities

Moscow and Leningrad will continue to be developed and renovated according to the original plan. Complete the third section of the Moscow Subway and largely complete the Palace of Soviets.

In the agricultural sector, add 1,500 machine tractor stations and build several new granaries with a total capacity of more than 10 million tons.

To improve the cultural standards of working people in urban and rural areas, the consumption of the working people should be increased by more than 1.5 times. The number of workers and staff should increase by 17% compared to 1937, their average wages should increase by 35%, and total wages should increase by 62%. The state should allocate funds for cultural and material service undertakings, including social insurance, education, health, and allowances for children, which should be increased from 30.8 billion in 1937 to 53 billion rubles. The income of collective farmers should also be greatly increased.

In terms of education, universal secondary education should be implemented in cities, and the implementation of universal seven-year education (primary education) should be completed in rural areas. The number of primary and secondary school students in cities should increase to 12.7 million, in rural areas to 27.7 million, and the number of university students should increase to 650,000.

The state health expenditure should increase from 10.3 billion in 1937 to 16.5 billion rubles in 1942. The value of state and cooperative trade should increase from 126 billion in 1937 to 206 billion rubles in 1942.

The gross national income should increase by 1.8 times in five years.

Advancing Towards Victory

From Molotov's report, we can see: First, after the second five-year plan, the Soviet Union has eliminated all exploiting classes. It has eradicated all factors that could lead to the exploitation of man by man and the division of society into exploiters, and it has basically established the first stage of communist socialism in the country. Second, the third five-year plan is based on the new stage of Soviet development and aims to complete the construction of a classless socialist society, gradually transitioning from socialism to communism. Third, in order to complete the third five-year plan, the communist education of the working people has gained decisive importance. The current conditions have made the position of the Soviet intelligentsia increasingly important. They know how to work and struggle in the Bolshevik style, thereby improving the cultural level and communist consciousness of the working people. Fourth, Molotov also specifically pointed out in his report that in order to complete the tasks and opinions stipulated in the third five-year plan, it is necessary to launch socialist competition and the Stakhanov movement, resolutely maintain labor discipline, and completely eliminate the counter-revolutionary sabotage activities of the Trotskyist and Bukharinist fascists and foreign capitalist spies, such as strengthening the vigilance of the Bolsheviks. Finally, we can see from this report that after the political and economic position of the Soviet socialist society has been consolidated, cadres who can grasp production technology have decisive importance. This Soviet cultural force will lead the working masses to engage in a great struggle to strive for the complete victory of communism.

(2) Report on the Amendment to the Party Constitution – Modifying the Conditions for Recruiting Party Members

Zhdanov's report on the Outline for Revising the Party Constitution first suggested modifying the conditions for recruiting party members. Because the class boundaries among the Soviet working people have been largely eliminated since the completion of the second five-year plan, the economic and political contradictions between workers, peasants, and intellectuals have also been largely eliminated and are tending to disappear. The conditions for the Communist Party to recruit new party members should also be appropriately modified. Currently, the procedures for recruiting party members are divided into four classes according to the social status of the applicant. Chapter 1 of the All-Union Communist Party Constitution (unanimously adopted by the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party) stipulates:

1. All those who recognize the Party Program, work in a Party organization, obey Party resolutions, and pay Party dues shall be considered Party members.

2. (Omitted)

3. Acceptance of party members can only be carried out according to individual procedures. New party members are accepted from candidate party members who have passed the prescribed probationary period, received political common sense education, and understood the Party Program and Party Constitution. Workers, collective farmers, Red Army soldiers, students, and staff who have performed well in the sympathy group, in the Soviets, trade unions, youth leagues, cooperatives, and congresses, and who have received criticism from the organization where they previously or currently work, can be accepted as party members.

The procedures for candidate party members to become party members are as follows:

(1) Four categories are stipulated: 1. Industrial workers with five years of production experience; 2. Industrial workers with less than five years of production experience, agricultural workers, Red Army soldiers from workers and collective farmers, engineering and technical personnel who work directly in workshops or production sections; 3. Collective farmers, members of handicraft combinations, primary school teachers; 4. Other staff.

(2) To join the party, the first category of people must have three party members with five years of party membership to introduce them; the second category of people must have five party members with five years of party membership to introduce them; the third category of people must have five party members with five years of party membership and an introduction from the political department of the agricultural machinery station or a representative of the district committee; the fourth category of people must have five party members with ten years of party membership to introduce them.

(3) Omitted below

This method is not in line with the class structure of Soviet society after the victory of socialism. Therefore, Zhdanov's report proposed to abolish the current classification of recruiting party members. From now on, when new party members join, whether they are workers, peasants, or intellectuals, the procedures should be the same.

Increase the Provisions of Party Members' Rights

In the past, the rights of party members were considered self-evident and were not listed in the Party Constitution. This report proposed adding a new clause to the Party Constitution, stipulating that party members have the right to criticize any party staff at the party meeting, to elect and be elected into the party organs, to require attendance at any time when the activities or behavior of Japanese people are discussed and decided, to raise any questions, or to declare to any party organization, including the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party.

Regarding the Abolition of Party Purification Methods

The Soviet Party purification method was adopted when the New Economic Policy was first implemented. Now that the situation has evolved, this method no longer has any reason to continue to exist. At the same time, the experience in implementation has also proved that this method cannot individually examine each party member. As a result, it is not effective for opposition elements who are good at disguising themselves, but it is easy to expel loyal and conscientious party members on the grounds of "passivity." Therefore, Zhdanov's report proposed to abolish the method of periodic mass purification of the party, and suggested that when deciding on the issue of expulsion from the party, a very cautious and concerned attitude should be adopted, the reasons for the accusations against party members should be carefully examined, and the rights of party members should be protected so that they are not harmed by any arbitrary actions. Expulsion from the party should be used as the party's highest punishment and only used when it is unavoidable.

Truly Realize Democracy Within the Party

Zhdanov's report also proposed to list the various methods that the Soviet Communist Party has already implemented to effectively realize the effectiveness of democracy within the party as concrete clauses in the Party Constitution, such as secret voting in party elections, prohibiting nominations, party members can criticize and attack candidates without restriction, and periodically convene meetings of active party workers in urban areas. Because the primary organizational task of the party is the correct selection of cadres and the examination of the implementation status of resolutions, Zhdanov's report suggested setting up a Cadre Department under the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, and setting up cadres under the provincial and regional party committees, the central committees of the party of the national republics, and the city and district committees.

Add a Propaganda Department

In order to improve the party's propaganda work to a proper level, the report suggested setting up a Propaganda Department under the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, and setting up propaganda departments under the provincial and regional party committees, the central committees of the party of the national republics, and the city and district committees.

Because the pace of the party's and the country's life is accelerating, and in order to solve urgent problems in the party's policy in a timely manner, the report proposed to convene a plenary meeting of representatives of the party's local branches throughout the country at least once a year, and to empower the meeting with the right to recall members of the Central Committee who cannot effectively perform their responsibilities and to elect other members to replace them, but the number cannot exceed one-fifth of the number of Central Committee members elected by the Party Congress. The decisions of the above-mentioned meeting, except for the replacement of Central Committee members, must be approved by the Central Committee.

Party Department Supervises Production Institutions

Because the basic organizations of the party have become increasingly strong and their relationship with practical administrative and cultural work has become increasingly close, Zhdanov's report also suggested: In order to strengthen the status of each basic organization in each production institution, including state-owned and collective farms, and to increase its responsibility for each institution, it is necessary to empower the organization with the right to supervise the work of the administrative organization of each institution. The party organizations in each People's Committee cannot implement supervision due to the special working conditions of the Soviet organs. They must notify the Central Committee of the Party and the leading personnel of each People's Committee of the deficiencies in the work of each People's Committee and each of its staff members.

Promote New Working Cadres

Furthermore, in order to create conditions for promoting new working cadres to take on leadership work within the party, the report suggested stipulating that the minimum party experience for secretaries of provincial and regional committees and central committees of national republics should be more than five years (previously it was twelve years). The minimum party experience for secretaries of each lower-level party branch should also be reduced accordingly.

Conclusion: When the fascist aggressors are intensifying their attacks on democratic peace-loving countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and are implementing their war to redivide the world, in order to undermine the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy, undermine the growing prestige of the Soviet Union among democratic peace-loving countries and all righteous people in the world, and undermine the close ties between democratic peace-loving countries and the Soviet Union, they have spared no expense in spending huge sums of money and manpower to carry out a slander campaign against the Soviet Union's foreign policy, especially its internal situation. However, from Molotov's report on the Third Five-Year Plan, we can see the unprecedented progress and victory of the Soviet Union and the entire people of the Union in their economy, culture, and daily life. This progress and victory is still developing at a rapid pace. (Here we should know that the economic situation of the capitalist countries and their people, especially the countries under the control of fascist aggressors such as Japan, Germany, and Italy, and their people, and their material and cultural living conditions, on the contrary, are unprecedentedly regressing and impoverished—) At the same time. From the "Outline for Revising the Party Constitution" reported by Zhdanov at this Congress, we can see the improvement of the political status of the Soviet people and the leap forward progress of the entire Soviet Union. This progress itself is an invincible force. It silently shattered the rumors of the fascist foreign capitalists about the Soviet Union. It will also silently increase its prestige among the working masses and righteous progressives in the world, and fulfill its task as the most loyal and strongest guardian of world peace and culture.

### ×Devaluation of Legal Tender, Oppression of Chinese and Foreign Banks ×Failure to Obtain Foreign Exchange Led to Significant Impact from Counterfeit Currency Circulation

(Shanghai Correspondence) Since the implementation of our country's legal tender policy, due to sufficient reserves, it has gained the faith of both Chinese and foreigners. The Japanese, after failing to obtain foreign exchange through a "linked banknote" scheme, have forcibly devalued the legal tender, and both Chinese and foreign banks have been subjected to oppression. Representatives from banking circles in North China have arrived in Shanghai to report on the situation, details of which are as follows:

Counterfeit Currency Everywhere

Since the fall of Tianjin, the puppet organization in Peiping established the "China United Reserve Bank" and issued banknotes without any collateral, forcing their circulation in the market. As of January 10th of this year, the total amount in circulation reached a staggering 185 million yuan. In addition, there were unsecured banknotes issued by the "Central Bank of Manchuria" and the "Ji-dong Bank," with approximately 16 million yuan circulating in Peiping and Tianjin. Furthermore, the Hebei Provincial Bank has expanded its issuance to 58 million yuan. Recently, the "United Reserve Bank" has also issued three types of small-denomination, non-convertible paper money in denominations of five fen, one fen, and half a fen. The scope of circulation is extremely broad, and the quantity issued is unlimited.

Forced Devaluation

The aim of the puppet "United Reserve Bank" in issuing banknotes was to absorb our legal tender and seize foreign exchange. However, due to the Chinese government's control of foreign exchange and the people's increasing faith in the legal tender, the counterfeit currency was only accepted and paid out. As a result, the puppet organization's plan to obtain foreign exchange failed, and the circulation of counterfeit currency was greatly affected. Consequently, orders were issued, first forcibly halting the circulation of our legal tender in Peiping, Tianjin, and other occupied areas. Subsequently, the China and Communications Banks in Tianjin were limited to using legal tender banknotes at 90% of their face value. From January 20th of this year, the rate was further reduced to 60%, and from March 10th, the circulation of legal tender was completely stopped in the market.

Oppressing the Market

The puppet interim government's finance department, in conjunction with the Peiping Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association, stipulated that from February 20th, all deposit contracts using the term "legal tender" must be changed to the term "national currency" (meaning the puppet United Reserve Bank's banknotes). Failure to do so would result in a discount of 60% based on the second devaluation. Foreign banks would continue to pay in legal tender for drafts, but checks would be divided into legal tender and "puppet currency." During the second devaluation period, foreign bank notes could only be collected at a 60% discount. After March 10th, they could no longer be collected.

Real Currency Situation

In fact, in the guerrilla areas of North China and the concession and embassy areas of Tianjin and Peiping, legal tender trades at a premium of approximately 2%, and no one has ever been heard of using our legal tender at a 90% or 60% discount. This shows that the price of our legal tender remains stable and its credit is increasingly strong. On the contrary, although "puppet currency" is widely accepted in Peiping and Tianjin, its actual price is lower than that of legal tender.

### Various Circles in Chongqing Host Soiree for Families of Soldiers

[Chongqing Correspondence] The families of soldiers fighting at the front are the most glorious families in China's war of resistance. Their glory is like that of a family in the imperial examination era whose children passed the highest level exam... The bustling scene in Chongqing is the radiation and pervasion of the glory of these 'Glorious Families.'

Motorcades of cars offering support are speeding along, and dragon lanterns and musical ensembles are performing in the bustling areas. What deserves special attention is the grand 'Soiree in Honor of Families of Soldiers,' held at Daliangzi. By a little after 3 p.m., the venue was already packed, with every inch of the second and third floors also filled with people. In total, there were perhaps two or three thousand people, men and women, young and old, each with strong, healthy faces and smiles of reassurance and victory, symbolizing the health and happiness of the soldiers at the front.

At this time, the reporter interviewed sixty-year-old Jiang Yuncheng and fifty-year-old Lei Laotai. Strangely, they both unanimously told me that their children's conscription was out of their own free will. Jiang Pinggui is only eighteen years old and has been in the army for more than a year. He is a patriotic and filial child. His letter to his father read: "The lamb kneels for milk, the bird feeds its mother. How can a human being be inferior to birds and beasts? Therefore, I have saved twenty yuan from my pay to provide for you." Jiang told me that Pinggui used to support the family by ferrying boats, but later business declined due to the opening of steamships, so he joined the army to kill [the enemy], both to save the country and to help support the family. When Lei Laotai's son left home to enlist, he did not obtain his mother's permission. The old mother suddenly realized that her son was missing and became anxious, but later she knew that he must have joined the army because he had told her, "If we don't go to kill the Japanese [enemy], China will be destroyed."

Great Chinese nation! Who says it is still a sleeping lion?

Around 3:30, officials such as Ye Gongchuo, Shao Lizi, Lü Chao, Ms. Shi Liang representing Madame Chiang, and community leaders such as Hu Wenlan and Wen Shaohe led the opening ceremony on the platform. Minister Chen Cheng of the Political Department presided over the ceremony and delivered a message of condolence. Because of continuous meetings, his throat was already hoarse, but he still raised his voice and said: The Japanese [enemy] imperialists have been plotting for decades to destroy China and enslave our people. Our supreme leader knows the Japanese's vicious plot, so he resolutely launched the war of resistance. This war of resistance should be the responsibility of our entire nation. If we want to resist, we must have an excellent army. An excellent army is composed of our excellent people. The war has been going on for more than a year... the [enemy] has been unable to cope with our attacks. But we are becoming stronger and stronger. We are absolutely confident of achieving final victory. This is the achievement and glory of your children and husbands—dear families of soldiers. I want to tell you that your children and husbands at the front have a very good life and are very secure. I came from the front, and I feel that the front is better than the rear. I saw that the brothers at the front were very strong and healthy. Moreover, the government is very concerned about your children and husbands, so it has decided to give preferential treatment to the families of soldiers and has established a soldiers' comfort association to formulate comfort measures. Each family of a soldier receives two dan of grain, which is equivalent to fifteen yuan, and this will be issued every three months. In Chongqing, this will be handled by the Social Affairs Bureau. If it is found that a Baojia chief is abusing or cheating, you can report it to the government for investigation. Finally, one point is that our current war of resistance is directly related to defending our homeland. We are now going to kill the Japanese, so that they cannot come to Sichuan. Otherwise, if everyone does not take action, the Japanese can kill us in Sichuan and use cruel bestial behavior, like the people of the Lower Yangtze have suffered, to kill our parents, children, and [enemy] our sisters. In the past, the common people regarded being a soldier as a hardship. Now, it is no longer the same. In some places, the people are vying to volunteer to be soldiers. As long as everyone unites to eliminate the Japanese [enemy], our nation will have a way out. After Minister Chen finished speaking, Hu Wenlan and Wen Shaohe also gave speeches, generally saying that "the families of soldiers who have gone to war are the most glorious figures, so we should respect the soldiers and also respect the families of soldiers. In the future, we must further promote this significance, so that more people will join the army, and victory can be achieved more quickly." Ms. Shi Liang, representing Madame Chiang, also encouraged the women to encourage their husbands, sons, brothers, and younger brothers to kill [the enemy]. Madame Chiang will definitely use her full spirit to find ways to comfort our soldiers at the front, so that their families have work to do and their children have books to read. Chongqing is now preparing to establish a factory for the families of soldiers. In the future, when it is established, we hope that everyone will actively participate. Finally, the families of soldiers, Zhang Minglou, Luo Renzhai, and others delivered responses, thanking the authorities for their concern and happily comforting the soldiers. They unanimously believe that this is the duty of the people. "The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual. The victory at the front is the happiness of the rear. Moreover, it is truly an honor to have our children at the front killing [the enemy]," and so on.

The wonderful and cheerful entertainment program began, and two or three thousand hearts in the venue were transformed into emotions of glory and joy. (3.1)

### Our Counter-Offensive in Central Hubei Advances, Enemy Annihilated in Xiantao Town, Situation Tense in Henan, Major Battle Imminent

[Central News Agency, Shashi, 7th] The war in Central Hubei is extremely fierce. Our forces are actively counter-attacking on all fronts, achieving many victories. On the Hankou-Yichang Railway, our troops are approaching Wamiaoji. Five to six hundred [enemy] soldiers and more than twenty tanks at Sanyangdian were attacked by our forces multiple times, and [enemy] casualties were heavy. The [enemy] in Xiantao Town were annihilated by our forces, and Xiantao Town has been recaptured.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 8th] A foreigner who recently arrived here from Yichang told an Associated Press reporter that the Japanese army had occupied Anlu, and the situation in Yichang was somewhat tense. However, whether the Japanese army's next move would be to cross the Xiang River to the south or to attack Xi'an is still unknown. Military experts told the Associated Press reporter that the Chinese army is now preparing to defend against the Japanese army's advance along the Pinghan and Longhai railway lines in Henan Province. After occupying Anlu, the Japanese army may target Xiangyang and then attack Laohukou from Xiangyang.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 8th] A Japanese military spokesman said that there are currently about seventy divisions, totaling about 300,000 Chinese troops, fighting the Japanese army in the area south of the Longhai Railway and west of the Pinghan Railway. The Japanese army in Anlu is advancing towards Suixian. It is reported that the Chinese army has moved northwest. Also, about seven divisions of Chinese troops between Haizhou and Xuzhou are intercepting the Japanese army in northern Jiangsu. Yesterday, Sunday, Japanese air force units bombed Chinese cities and Ningxia in the northwest. At that time, about thirty Japanese aircraft attacked Ningxia, and about twenty aircraft entered the airspace and dropped bombs on the area.

[Central News Agency, Sihui, 8th] In the morning of the 7th, more than a hundred [enemy] soldiers, with three cannons, sneaked from Sanshui to harass Jiaogang. Our troops launched a surprise attack, occupying the area north of Jiaogang. During the fierce battle with the [enemy], our artillery in Ma Fang and the He Cannon fired in support. Several shells hit the [enemy] positions, killing dozens of [enemy] soldiers. The [enemy] could not withstand the attack and retreated towards Shang Mian in Sanshui.

(Special dispatch from Chang'an City, this newspaper, 7th) More than five hundred [enemy] soldiers from Dangcheng attacked Longjia Yao, east of Lingshan, on the 2nd, but were repelled by our forces, with more than fifty [enemy] soldiers killed.

### Vietnamese Government Sympathizes with China, Assists with Cholera Prevention Medicine

[This newspaper, Chongqing, 8th] The Vietnamese government is very sympathetic to our war of resistance and has assisted with 100,000 doses of cholera prevention medicine, which has been transported to Chongqing via Yunnan and distributed to various regions.

### ×Soldiers Revolt, Hua Nan ×Disputes Arise Repeatedly, ×Military Leaders Worry About The Future

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Due to repeated internal disputes within the Japanese army in China and frequent anti-war incidents, the military headquarters recently dispatched a large number of personnel to various regions to supervise. Japanese army supervisors Koki and Zhuang Tian in South China arrived here the day before yesterday. It is said that since the [enemy] army landed in the [enemy] region, until the end of December last year, there were a total of 27 internal disputes and anti-war incidents within the Japanese army in South China, including 15 anti-war incidents. The future of the war is particularly worrying.

Internal Disputes Abound, Nakano Heavily Attacked

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 8th] According to Japanese sources, Nakano may be dismissed from his position as a member of parliament for being absent from parliamentary meetings. The real reason is that Nakano gave a speech in Shanghai the day before yesterday attacking the government. Nakano and another member of parliament, Kimura, had requested a week's leave from parliament to accompany German and Italian reporters to China to inspect the war. Now they want to extend their leave, and it is said that the Seiyukai party has expressed opposition. If they are not allowed to extend their leave, they must return to the country within a week to attend the parliament. If they are overdue, they will be dismissed.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 8th] Local Japanese officials were furious about Nakano's speech yesterday and asked [the party] to deny that it had approved Nakano's speech draft. They said that he is the chairman of the Toho Society, but he does not have the power to influence the government. Japanese military officials said that Nakano is overly sensitive. However, it is understood that [they] have refused Nakano to accompany German and Italian reporters to inspect the [front] line.

### Gausmètre to Present Credentials Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] French Ambassador Gausmètre is scheduled to present his credentials on the 10th.

### Japan Deliberately Destroys Peace, All Nations Should Actively Aid China; Foreign Minister Wang Exposes Enemy Peace-Seeking Conspiracy; Our Diplomatic Situation More Favorable Than Before

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 8th] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui told officials of the United States today that "a roundtable conference convened by the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to discuss ending the Sino-Japanese War is the only feasible way to resolve the war and establish peace. China will agree to participate in this conference, provided that the conference must maintain China's territorial and administrative integrity, the Open Door Policy, and the principle of equal opportunity. The interests of Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union in the Far East are very great, the same as Japan. Can send notes to Japan (not necessarily joint notes), urging Japan to participate in this conference to discuss peace, but at present Japan obviously has no intention of accepting this form of mediation, because Japan's 'New Order in East Asia' policy is based on seizing hegemony over the entire Pacific region, which was clearly expressed in the Konoe Declaration in December last year. However, as the war lengthens, Japan's national strength is gradually turning [against it], and at that time, it will accept mediation. After the mediation of the third country tends to fail, active steps should be taken to aid [China], and passive steps such as boycotting Japanese goods should be taken. These steps can be effective. Recently, Great Britain and the United States have provided loans to China, and the attitudes of Great Britain, the United States, and France towards Japan have gradually strengthened. China's diplomacy has progressed more than a few months ago."

### Commemorating March 8th

— Soong Mei-ling

——Original Speech at the Chongqing Commemoration Meeting——

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] The original text of Madam Chiang Soong Mei-ling's speech at the "March 8th" Commemoration Meeting is recorded as follows:

Fellow compatriots, today we are holding a meeting to commemorate "March 8th." This "March 8th" was designated as International Women's Day at a meeting held in Copenhagen in 1909. It has been exactly 30 years to this day, so today is the 30th anniversary of "March 8th." Our women of the Republic of China, in today's [enemy's] invasion and the suffering of the country, in today's war of resistance and national construction, are holding this important commemoration. Each of our hearts must have a special feeling. The meaning of "March 8th," as everyone knows, is to seek women's liberation, but so-called "women's liberation" is not just liberation for its own sake. It requires the efforts of our women compatriots to enhance the status of our nation, to make national life influenced by women, thereby raising its standards in both spiritual and material aspects, so that the majority and even all of our compatriots can obtain independent, free, and equal happiness. We must recognize that women's liberation cannot be seen as merely a right, but should be regarded as a responsibility. Why do we demand women's liberation? It is to take on our women's responsibilities. In other words, if we want to truly seek women's liberation, we must first be able to take on responsibilities. Our leader, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, said a few very important words in a speech in 1924: "The reason why the revolution cannot succeed is that individuals fight for freedom and forget the freedom of the country. We must know that without the freedom of the country, individuals cannot be free." This is a very true principle. We need liberation, and we must also know that if the country is not liberated, the women of our country will not be truly liberated. Our country is being bullied and invaded by [enemy] people today, and the entire nation is under the military oppression of violence. All of our compatriots are suffering and in pain. If we do not first rescue this critical country, our 450 million men and women will all become slaves of a lost country. Where can we talk about women's liberation, and who can we ask for women's liberation?

I often say that women's liberation depends on the efforts of women themselves. If our women's knowledge and ability are constantly improving, and our women are making real contributions to the country, the nation, and the world, then women's status will naturally rise. Now some people may think that women's participation in politics is the first step in seeking women's liberation. This may be true. Modern countries cannot deny that women should have the right to participate in politics, but the true meaning of women's liberation is not just to seek for a small number of women to gain political and economic status, but to liberate the suffering of the majority of women and improve the lives of the majority of women compatriots, starting with education and organization to enhance women's abilities and improve women's status. Moreover, to be honest, it is not enough to only talk about women's liberation. We must use our women's strength to achieve the liberation of all our compatriots, and that is how we fulfill our responsibilities.

Today, many representatives of women's organizations are present, including women from intellectual circles, women from professional circles, and women from the working class. Among the tens of millions of female compatriots, we are considered to be more capable and influential. Although we cannot be said to be the first to know and understand, we are at least above the average level. We must think about how we can be worthy of our own knowledge and abilities. How can we be worthy of the education and training we have received? How can we be worthy of our country, our nation, and the era in which we live? Especially important is what attitude should these many women's groups take to contribute to the general compatriots?

I will tell you a story. I remember when Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands was young, her father had already passed away. One day, on her tenth birthday, her mother held a celebration for her, and tens of thousands of men and women came to the palace to congratulate her. The young queen saw this enthusiastic scene and was very happy and moved. She said to her mother, "Do these people belong to us?" Her mother said, "No, they do not belong to you, but you belong to them." I hope that the women compatriots present today will also recognize that we belong to the people, not that the people belong to us. When we do everything, we must not think that we can control the people, but we must think that we are servants of the people. We must approach the people, go deep among the people, and sincerely serve our compatriots, educate them, help them, relieve their pain, and create their happiness.

In this extraordinary period, the welfare of the country and the people is consistent. If we cannot win the war of resistance, our nation will not survive. If our national construction is not successful, we will not have any happiness. Today, our female compatriots must all measure the size of their knowledge and abilities and determine the weight of their responsibilities. The greater one's knowledge and ability, the greater one's responsibility. We must have enthusiasm, perseverance, methods, and, even more so, organization, to take on all kinds of work related to the war of resistance. We must promote thrift, encourage production, advance social education, preside over relief efforts, encourage joining the army to kill [the enemy], and assist in the war of resistance propaganda.

### British and French Consuls in Tianjin Protest to Japan Again; British Government Also Lodges Representations A Few Days Ago; Situation in Tianjin Concessions Surrounded is Grave

[Central News Agency, London, 7th] Regarding the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin placing barbed wire around foreign concessions, the British Consul there has lodged another protest. The British government also lodged a protest with the Tokyo government on the same day. According to responsible sources here, the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, lodged a protest with the Japanese government a few days ago.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 7th] Tianjin dispatch: It is reported that the British and French consular authorities met with the Japanese authorities yesterday, stating that the British and French authorities had previously issued a formal note pointing out the Japanese side's placement of obstacles around the British and French concessions. They specifically requested the Japanese side to explain who this action was aimed at and when it would be removed. However, no response has been received to date, and a prompt reply is requested. For several days, the obstacles near the concessions have not only not been removed but have also increased compared to the past. Reuters reporters recently inspected the boundaries of the concessions and saw that the British and French concessions had become a large-scale concentration camp (referring to the British and French concessions being surrounded on all sides by the Japanese). Wire mesh and other obstacles are piled up outside the boundaries, blocking all passages except for a few important roads. On both sides of the roads, there are armed Japanese sentries and a large number of Chinese police. So far, the Japanese side has not interfered with traffic inside and outside the concessions. A key stronghold near the concessions has a machine gun emplacement, which is very eye-catching. Electric fences have also been placed on the streets of various special districts near the concessions. Residents must navigate the electric fences when going out and returning home, like entering a maze, which is extremely inconvenient. Within the Japanese-occupied area, brick buildings have been erected on the main roads, occupying a large area, like barracks. In addition, sentry posts have been placed on the roads, making the roads narrower and causing great inconvenience to traffic. According to external reports, a bridge is being added between the Japanese concessions, leading to speculation among foreign communities here. It is said that the Japanese side plans to add a bridge south of the British concession so that all ships can be diverted to Special District 1. This area has become extremely prosperous since the Japanese side began large-scale development. These rumors have not yet been officially confirmed. However, Japanese bridge-building experts have now come to Tianjin, and a large quantity of materials for bridge construction is piled up in Special District 1. The location where the materials are piled up is near the rumored bridge site, indicating that the rumors are likely to be true. Failure to instigate Wu Peifu

### Shameless Behavior of Traitors; All Kinds of Ugly Performances; Failure to Incite Wu Peifu; Another "New Heavenly Way Society" Formed

[Associated Press, Peiping, 7th] Several former subordinates of Wu Peifu, who tried to persuade Wu to come out but failed to achieve good results, have now changed their approach and organized a so-called "New Heavenly Way Society." The society was established today in Zhongnanhai here, issuing a declaration requesting Taoist believers to oppose the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and to shake hands with Japan. The chairman is Jiang Yanxing, and the president is Jiang [illegible]. Chinese people here all sneer at them.

### Central Government Sends Senior Official to Inspect Yunnan Conscripts

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 8th Special Dispatch] The Central Government will send a senior official to Yunnan to inspect the training of conscripts.

### Xiang-Gui Waterway Project

— Changren

[Our Newspaper, Guilin Shipping News] In the 1940s, transportation, in terms of space, has developed from land and water to the sky; in terms of time, transportation has progressed to speeds that are difficult for the human body to endure. However, due to the two inversely proportional principles of the faster the speed, the lighter the load, and the faster the speed, the greater the cost, most transportation still seeks development in terms of heavy load and cost savings. For example, automobiles are indeed perfect tools in terms of heavy load and speed; however, the goods carried by twenty automobiles can be transported by just one railway freight car. Similarly, the goods that two hundred, or even four hundred or eight hundred, automobile drivers can carry can be transported by just two or three large railway drivers. In this way, the freight rate of trains is much cheaper than that of automobiles. Conversely, if the time allows for the use of shipping for the goods carried by a train, then even if one hundred steamboats or one thousand sailboats are used, low freight rates can still be achieved. This is one of the reasons for the competition between various countries in the world for shipping.

Everyone knows the importance of transportation in wartime. The purpose of war is to compete for time and space, and transportation is a means of this competition. Since the War of Resistance against Japan, our country has learned many lessons in this regard and has been striving to make up for the deficiencies in this area. Our country's air transport encountered setbacks during the period of development due to the war. Although it is still trying to develop under the threat of a superior enemy air force, the flight routes have actually been shortened quite a bit. After entering the second phase of the War of Resistance, railway transportation also greatly reduced its capacity due to the continuous occupation of railway lines. From now on, almost 80% of the transportation will have to rely on automobile transportation. In our current situation where we cannot manufacture automobiles ourselves and cannot refine gasoline ourselves, both military and economic aspects are considerably affected. For example, transporting a truckload of ammunition from Kunming to Changsha, according to a person in charge of automobile transportation, "one-third of the load capacity of a truck has to be used to carry gasoline; and because the roads are not as perfect as imagined, one-third of the life of a truck is shortened as a result." Extrapolating from this phenomenon, our consumption on automobile transportation in this phase of the War of Resistance must be very alarming.

Military authorities have long been concerned about this. In the Eastern Theater, the Lunan Battlefield, and various battles along the Yangtze River, in addition to using railways and highways as much as possible, water transport was more fully utilized. Furthermore, it was anticipated that the development of the war would inevitably enter the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the lower reaches of the Pearl River; at the same time, southern Hunan and Guangxi would inevitably be the sites where our troops must fight and defend, and must win. Therefore, starting in the first half of last year, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission was instructed to begin planning and carrying out the Xiang-Gui Waterway Project, hoping to connect the Yangtze River and the Pearl River in an "I" shape, like the Grand Canal connecting the Hai River, the Yellow River, and the Yangtze River, to compensate for the lack of and damage to railway and highway transportation and to increase the convenience of military and civilian transport.

The Xiang-Gui Waterway starts from Changsha in the north and reaches Cangwu, where the Gui River and the West River converge, in the south, with a total length of over 1,000 kilometers, almost the sum of the total lengths of the Xiang River, Li River, and Gui River. The traffic situation in the basin of this waterway is mostly the same as that of the canal basin between Jiangxu Wu County (Suzhou) and Jiaxing, Zhejiang, with parallel railway lines, highway lines, and waterways intersecting each other. The Xiang River and the Li River both originate in the Xing'an Mountains in northern Guangxi, flowing north and south, with one branch connecting them. Above Hengyang, the Xiang River can only be used by civilian boats. Between Weiyang and Changsha, small steamboats operate during the flood season in spring and summer; below Changsha, there are no Yangtze River steamers passing through. The Li River is a section of waterway from Xing'an through Guilin to [illegible] Le. Above Guilin, there is little benefit of boat travel during the dry season; between Guilin and Pingle, the deepest point is no more than four or five feet, and the shallowest point is only one or two feet. The river surface is about half a li wide in wide places and four or five zhang wide in narrow places, and it can be crossed on foot. Therefore, electric boats can only pass for two months of the year, and civilian boats pass at other times. The waterway between Pingle and Cangwu is called the Gui River, and the waterway gradually widens and deepens. However, because there are more shoals than in the Li River, electric boats can only pass for four months of the year throughout the year.

From the above description, it can be known that the section of the Xiang-Gui Waterway from Hengyang to Pingle is the most difficult, especially near Xing'an, which serves as the watershed. The waterways are still in their natural state, unlike the Yangtze River, which has been artificially dredged and constrained. Therefore, the "canalization" and "governance" of river management can be used together.

The Xiang-Gui Waterway Project Office, under the command of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, was established on September 1st last year. The director is Zhang Hanying. The official work started in late September. Because it was to meet the urgent needs of the second phase [of the war], and because engineering materials such as mixed concrete, steel bars, and steel plates had to be given priority for military use, fundamental work could not be carried out. The "control section" of 150 kilometers in Guilin County—that is, the waterway near the Xing'an watershed to the north and south—which was started to be surveyed in May last year, was also partially improved: increasing the water depth of the navigation channel during low water to eight public inches (approximately two feet or so). One is to shorten the transportation time, and the other is to increase the water transport weight. As for the Li River, sluice gates must be built above Guilin and the channel must be deepened so that work can continue to be implemented after completion.

The partial improvement project from Darongjiang north of Guilin to Daxu south of Guilin is currently underway. This includes four projects: dredging the navigation channel, diverting the flow, installing capstans, and blasting rocks. Unfortunately, it is not easy to recruit workers, so large-scale construction cannot be carried out. However, more than 20 projects can still be completed by the end of April this year. Early May to the end of September is the flood season, and next year's work will begin in October. It is hoped that this section of the project can be completed in the first half of next year.

The purpose of the Xiang-Gui Waterway Project is not only to connect the Yangtze River and the Pearl River and to open up a new era in inland navigation; its greater role is to have the mission of connecting international inland navigation. The mainstream of the upper reaches of the West River, from Cangwu to Guiping, is called the Xun River; from Guiping to Yongning (Nanning) to the west, it is called the Yu River; from [illegible] Ning to the west to Long [illegible], it is called the Li River (Zuojiang). One source of the Li River is the Guixi border area, which flows into French Annam near the Pingmeng Pass and re-enters the country near the Shuikou Pass; the other is the Jixi in Annam, which flows into the country near the Pingnan Fan and converges in Longjin. Although there is little convenience of navigation on the river channel above Longjin, Longjin is the southernmost major city on the extension line of the Xiang-Gui Railway, only more than 50 kilometers away from Annam. If the waterway project in this area is completed, the international transportation in our southwest will inevitably be changed again; at the same time, the value of the Pearl River, one of the four major rivers in our country, will also be re-evaluated.

### North China Railway and Highway [Japanese] are Planning to Control Them Again; Establishing a "Transportation Company" in North China; Greed for Railways in Central China is also Urgent

[Reuters, Tokyo dispatch] According to the "Nichinichi Shimbun" here, the Japanese "Asia Development Board" has recently decided to fully organize a so-called "North China Transportation Company" to specialize in controlling the railways and highways in North China. The Jinpu Line and the Ping-Sui Line are included in this company. The "Company" has a capital of 300 million yen, with each share at 50 yen. In terms of investment allocation, the "North China Development Company" will invest 150 million yen in materials, the North China puppet "Provisional Government" will invest 30 million yen in cash, and the Mantetsu Company will invest 150 million yen in cash. At the same time, the "Asia Bureau" is currently drafting another "Central China Transportation Company" to be controlled by a Central China Development Company to manage the railways in Central China, such as the southern section of the Jinpu Line and a section of the Longhai Line.

[Japanese] Puppet Exchange Control; Aim is to Expel Foreign Merchants

[Reuters, Tianjin, 8th] A business leader here told reporters that the North China puppet government's measures to restrict import and export trade are aimed at forcing foreign banks to use puppet currency and exchange it for exchange rates that they cannot currently obtain. Since the Chinese government's banknotes are circulating in the interior, it is doubtful whether this restriction will be effective. If foreign governments recognize this restriction, the business interests of foreigners in North China, which have been built up over many years, will be constrained by others. "The puppet state of Manchukuo can serve as a warning. Although this new restriction is said to be seeking cooperation with foreigners, its ultimate purpose is to weaken foreign interests and benefit Japan. Therefore, the only appropriate action is for various countries to take retaliatory measures against Japanese commerce."

### [Japanese] Attempt to Establish a Powerful Radio Station; Disrupting Public Opinion; Concealing [Japanese] Actions; Economic Constraints; The Dream of a Fool

[Hong Kong News] [Japanese] Recently regarding the establishment of international status, someone proposed to the council yesterday to allocate 22.2 million yuan to establish a powerful radio station, hoping to promote it widely. [Text missing] After the station is established, Japan can directly communicate with the following places, such as here, New York, San Francisco, Canada, South Africa, Europe, South Africa, Egypt, the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, etc., and establish wireless telephone and wireless television equipment. In the future, if the plan is implemented, communication with Hong Kong can communicate with 97% of telephone users around the world, and can receive wireless television photos from 15 countries. However, given the economic situation of the [Japanese], this plan is really the dream of a fool. (People's Society)

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] U.S. President Roosevelt told the press today that if the United States must have a national vote before declaring war, then the defense of the United States will easily be undermined by any such law. He seems to believe that representative government should be applied to war as it is applied to other matters. The defense or major interests of the United States will be undermined by "quasi-war" acts.

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Rear Admiral Leahy commented to reporters today on Japan's desire to achieve naval equality with Britain and the United States within six years, saying, "If other countries want to increase their naval strength, then the United States must also increase its naval strength." He then went on to disclose the results of the recent U.S. naval exercises in the Caribbean. It is reported that attacking destroyers and submarines have invaded several points in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and northeastern Haiti, but no ship has been able to invade the United States. According to the [illegible] Daily, Rear Admiral Leahy said that he believes that the U.S. Navy should be ready at any time to uphold national policy. If U.S. national policy includes maintaining commerce, then the Navy should be prepared to protect it. He also said that he believes that the U.S. Navy is sufficient to deal with any combined fleet attacking the United States.

U.S. Senate Passes Army Expansion Bill

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Cooke testified before the Senate Naval Committee today, strongly advocating the establishment of an air base on Guam as an "outpost." He denied that improving Guam meant fortifying the island and said that the U.S. Navy really needs a base there to more quickly [illegible] the enemy's movements.

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] The U.S. Senate today passed the government's 72 million pound army expansion bill by a large majority. The bill will largely realize President Roosevelt's 110 million pound defense plan. The bill has now been submitted to a joint conference of the Senate and House of Representatives for discussion to adjust differences of opinion. Also, yesterday the Senate passed a bill authorizing the Army Department to have 6,000 aircraft, while the House of Representatives previously passed a bill authorizing only 5,500 aircraft. A joint conference of the two houses will also try to reconcile this difference. The Senate has agreed to limit the aircraft funding in the Army expansion bill to 60 million pounds and has agreed to limit the profits of aircraft manufacturers and others from contracts under this bill to 10%.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 7th] U.S. Democratic Senator Barkley explained in the Senate yesterday that the purpose of President Roosevelt's foreign policy is to maintain peace in the Western Hemisphere and also to contribute to world peace. The United States is unwilling to intervene in European problems by force, but if its own interests are threatened, it will rise up to protect them. Navy Rear Admiral Cooke told the Senate Naval Committee that Guam could become a "lookout post" for the U.S. Navy after it is fortified. Also, during a debate in the Senate today, Senator Clark said that President [Roosevelt] had never implemented the Neutrality Act after the Sino-Japanese War broke out. Senator Barkley said that it is questionable whether the President has the right to decide to implement the Neutrality Act in a state of undeclared war.

[Associated Press, London, 7th] It is reported that Britain and France have now expressed their willingness to [illegible] the Spanish Civil War, but they fear that Germany and Italy will encourage Franco to attack Madrid. (Reuters, Paris, 8th) Newspapers here unanimously express that Liu is concerned about the recent developments in the Spanish situation, and the war will soon come to an end. The newspapers generally express joy, but all demand that General Franco be tolerant and benevolent. "Le Petit Parisien" said, "Although the Burgos authorities have won a victory, they should not be without friendly kindness to those who bravely defended Madrid. Now General Franco can easily use force to seize all that the Republican government possesses. We would like to say, you have gained enough honor, please do not abuse your victory." The newspaper believes that peace talks are proceeding satisfactorily and that General Casado initiated the negotiations has also been confirmed. It is also said that Madrid is now in need of a glorious peace.

[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] According to rebel sources, General Casado of the Spanish government army tried to contact Franco last Saturday to seek peace negotiations, but Franco did not respond, insisting that the government army surrender unconditionally before he would consider it.

Negrín has arrived here and declared that he will soon transfer to Switzerland.

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] French sources said that negotiations for a Spanish armistice are believed to have begun.

[Reuters, Madrid, 7th] The Communist Party held a rebellion in the world today, but it was quickly put down. General Miaja [illegible] called for maintaining order, saying, "We do not want to see any more senseless bloodshed. I have shared weal and woe with you in the past. What I expect at this time is to give you peace. If we restore common sense, then I am convinced that this senseless bloodshed will cease." The communist rebellion was centered on the Workers' Party and the old site of the Bourbon Building. Several gunshots were heard this morning, but the afternoon was calm. A Reuters reporter toured the city this afternoon, saying that there were military police patrolling the streets and the city was very calm. The communists who had occupied the two buildings have surrendered.

[Reuters, Saint-Jean-de-Luz, 7th] According to reports from Burgos, General Franco has decided to attack Madrid. It is rumored that he believes that this attack can achieve a decisive victory. The rebels are keeping silent about the Madrid incident. The position of the National Defense Council is not yet known. General Casado originally promised that the main [illegible] personnel protecting Dr. Negrín would not be [illegible]. The Burgos report also confirmed the communist rebellion in Madrid. It was heard from the rebel front line in University City that there were rifle and machine gun sounds. Conflicts were also reported in Cuenca, Albacete, and Ciudad Real. Burgos believes that the Madrid Defense Council cannot fully control the areas under the jurisdiction of the government army.

[Reuters, Madrid, 8th] Officials have recently announced that several military leaders followed the Communist Party and launched a rebellion against the National Defense [Council], but they have now surrendered.

[Reuters, London, 7th] Sir John Kennaway [illegible] reported to the British Red Cross on the situation of Spanish refugees in the French economy, saying that what the French authorities need is [illegible] assistance rather than criticism. He believes that the best assistance is for Britain to immediately send a well-equipped hospital ship to France. Sir [Kennaway] described in detail the suffering of the sick and wounded. Tuberculosis and typhoid are spreading among the refugees. Many of the sick men sleep on small beds and straw mats, and some have no clothes to wear and are naked. What France is dealing with now is not an ordinary situation, but a retreating army. He also [illegible] praised the female nurses of the French Red Cross.

Philippine labor leader Aberdeene declared to the outside world today, "The farmers are determined to fight for their economic freedom, and the government should not suppress them with force." It is rumored that socialist elements are inciting the uprising, attempting to organize thousands of farmers to forcibly seize the ripe crops in the fields. President Quezon will allocate 250,000 US dollars so that the troops can be stationed in the violent areas for a long time.

Brief Comments

### US Aggressively Expanding Military

On the 7th, US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Leahy, in response to Japan's announcement of expanding its navy within six years, stated, "If a foreign country materially strengthens its naval power, the US Navy must also increase its strength." This clearly expresses the US's determination to resist Japan. On the same day, the US Senate passed the government's proposed 72 million pound army expansion bill by an absolute majority, and also passed a bill approving an increase in army aircraft to 6,000. This further indicates that the US government, as fascist aggressors intensify their adventurist policies, has determined its resolve to deal with them with strength. This serves as a strong contrast and admonition to the continued blind actions of some democratic and peaceful countries that vainly hope for peace through compromise and concession. However, "successful resistance cannot be carried out in isolation." Therefore, cooperation between the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union in the necessary anti-aggression war should be the urgent international task at hand. Former US Secretary of State Stimson's call the other day for democratic countries such as the US, Britain, and France to unite in resisting aggressor nations can be considered the most urgent and humane call of the moment.

### Japan's Provocations Against the Soviet Union

In recent days, Japan has intensified its provocations against the Soviet Union over the fishing grounds issue, and the Soviet Union's extremely tough attitude towards the Japanese emissaries has caused international concern about a major war in the Far East.

Japan's new provocations are clearly intended to create a serious atmosphere, first to ease domestic anti-war sentiment, and second to respond to Italy and Germany and even to deceive Britain and France. The Soviet Union's tough attitude will not only fail to promote a major war in the Far East but will also be enough to prevent the expansion of such a war. Japan will not dare to take risks under the Soviet Union's tough attitude, which is to be expected.

Therefore, with regard to the increasingly tense relations between the Soviet Union and Japan, we should pay attention to the following: first, Japan's provocation against the Soviet Union will, on the one hand, be a preliminary step toward a greater offensive against China, and on the other hand, will practically intensify its southward strategy, and from the international aspect and the activities of Chinese traitors, attempt to realize the cessation of our country's resistance! Second, the Soviet Union's toughness is sufficient to express the Soviet Union's attitude of "not threatening other countries nor being threatened," with its strong strength as its backing, and has great significance for assisting our country's resistance.

### Japan's Financial Crisis

— Translated by Shi Chang, Original author Kurt Bloch, published in the February issue of Asia-America Magazine

Everyone knows that the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War was due to Japan's aggression because Japan did not want China to move towards unification and unity, so it launched this destructive war. As the war expands and prolongs day by day, we can clearly see that Japan is not only fighting China alone but also fighting against the powers' interests in China. The Munich Agreement and the division of Czechoslovakia gave Japan's strategic work no small encouragement. Therefore, Japanese Foreign Minister Ugaki, who advocated maintaining friendly relations with Britain and the United States, did not receive the support of the military and was forced to step down, and was succeeded by Arita, who publicly advocated the abolition of the "Open Door" policy in April 1938. Soon Japan began to attack Guangzhou, threatening Hong Kong. Therefore, it was no accident that the US government issued a diplomatic note to Japan on October 6 last year, maintaining the "Open Door." Of course, Japan's response was still ambiguous, but according to Japan's semi-official rhetoric, it has clearly stated that Japan intends to monopolize China.

This threat to the interests of the powers cannot be said to be insignificant. Since the outbreak of the war caused by the Lugouqiao Incident, Japan has borrowed from Germany through "Manchukuo." According to general estimates, the amount of debt is at least about 45 million US dollars. It is very obvious that this is a war debt. Of course, Germany will therefore enjoy certain preferential and special rights and interests. The Japanese representative of the South Manchuria Railway in Germany has also firmly promised Germany and Italy special rights in China. However, Germany is preparing for a large-scale European war, and its economic and commercial situation is deteriorating day by day, and its export capacity has also been greatly reduced.

The South Manchuria Railway has recently requested a loan of 2.5 million US dollars from the United States for railway equipment, but it has not been successful. In addition, the general manager of the Manchuria Industrial Development Corporation has also set off to the United States, hoping to obtain the cooperation of American manufacturers to develop Manchuria's automobile, steel, iron, and coal industries. These are all military-related industries. The automobile industry can mechanize the Japanese army. The development of the steel and iron industry can make Japan not have to purchase from the United States. The development of Manchuria's coal mines can also alleviate Japan's coal shortage. However, Japan's consumption is very large, and various industries in Manchuria are also obviously unstable, so this matter has little hope of success. On the contrary, at the very time that Japan's attempt to borrow from the US failed, the Washington Export-Import Bank, under the jurisdiction of the US Reconstruction Finance Corporation, allowed China a large amount of credit loans, totaling 25 million US dollars, to exchange American agricultural and industrial products for Chinese tung oil (tung oil is an important raw material for quick-drying paint needed by the US automobile industry). Similarly, the British government adopted a "parallel action" by lending 500,000 pounds to China through the Export Credits Guarantee Department to develop trade and transportation between Burma and China. Several days later, the US Secretary of the Treasury declared that the Chinese government had a large amount of gold reserves stored in the United States as collateral, and the US government was preparing to expand loans to China.

Of course, Japan severely attacked the British and American moves to loan money to China. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita criticized the US loan to China, saying: "This is an inappropriate move by the United States. The US newspapers believe that the United States opposes Japan, so it has adopted this political attitude; I think this is an extremely dangerous attitude. Japan can consider this an economic pressure on Japan. The results expected by the United States will not be realized." At the same time, he further stated that the foreign concessions and extraterritorial rights in China should be abolished, and the economic activities of foreign businessmen should also be subject to certain restrictions.

At that time, the puppet governments in Beijing, Nanjing, Hankou, and Guangzhou, all controlled by Japan, held a joint meeting to discuss protesting the British and American loans to China and considering retaliatory measures. A Japanese military spokesman informally stated that these loans would only extend the war, which was about to end, to the summer and would not be very effective. This statement is very interesting and happens to contradict Japan's declaration on its China policy, as if admitting that by the summer of 1939, Japan's economic and financial situation would be close to collapse and it would not be able to defeat China. On the other hand, military experts unanimously believe that the Chinese army has moved inland, maintaining its strength. Japan's heavy artillery and mechanized units have gradually become ineffective. Under these circumstances, Japan cannot win. Recently, the situation has changed, and the wavering attitude of Britain and the United States has gradually strengthened, deciding to financially aid China, and can compete with Germany's financial aid to Japan. This is naturally gratifying to China. From the perspective of Britain and the United States, this is nothing strange. Not long before the start of the Sino-Japanese War, the British Export Credits Guarantee Department established a special office in Shanghai to promote trade between Britain and China. The US Washington Export-Import Bank also approved a loan to China for the first time around this time to sell 20 railway locomotives to the Chinese Ministry of Railways. Therefore, the current loans from Britain and the United States to China are merely a continuation of the economic policy of 1937.

The situation in East Asia has undergone new developments. The return of Britain and the United States to the economic policy of 1937 is very important. In 1937, Britain and the United States loaned money to China because they thought that China was a country with strong manpower and poor military equipment, and hoped that by providing financial assistance, it could gradually prosper and become an excellent market. However, at the end of 1938, the views of Britain and the United States on Japan and China had changed dramatically. A year and a half of war proved that China's military equipment was not as weak as they had imagined in 1937. Similarly, a year and a half of war also proved that Japan's military equipment was not as strong as it boasted and could not establish a new order in East Asia. On the contrary, Japanese officers do not have abundant military knowledge and economic knowledge, and even pro-Japanese Germany strictly criticizes the Japanese army. The political situation is also like this. The current politics in the occupied areas of China are darker and more turbulent than at any time in Chinese history. Unfortunately, the dreamy Japanese leaders have not seen this fact, have not discovered the terrible Japanese crisis, which is why it has repeatedly angered the powers, creating reasons for itself.

In April 1938, Arita sternly opposed the "Open Door" policy. After he took office as Foreign Minister, he still did not change his opinion, although the tone was slightly milder. On the other hand, the "victories" announced by the Japanese military leaders in China can only obtain the remaining remnants of Chinese soil to supply friendly Germany, Italy, and enterprises under Japanese control. At the same time, they are also doing their best to drive out foreign industries and commerce. Western countries have realized that the freedom of trade with China and the development of commercial interests can only be obtained from the central government of China. This situation is created by Japan, and the Japanese can only blame themselves.

The US loans to China are based on its long-standing traditional foreign policy. The United States has always been friendly to China, and the American churches in China often assist China. In the great flood of the Yangtze River in 1931, the US Farm Bureau lent 15 million US dollars to China. In 1933, after attending the London World Economic Conference, Song Ziwen arrived in the United States and obtained a loan of 50 million US dollars for cotton and wheat. From 1933 to 1934, China obtained loans of 17 million US dollars from the United States and established the "China Economic Committee." The US silver policy in 1936 significantly affected China's finances. The United States continued to purchase silver, effectively helping China consolidate its monetary foundation. When the US Import-Export Bank approved a loan to China for locomotives, Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and the US Secretary of the Treasury agreed that China would purchase substantial gold from the US. Therefore, it is not surprising that this new US loan, guaranteed by the Bank of China, will mutually exchange goods between the US and China.

It is obvious that China's new loans have greatly disappointed Japan. Since the Munich Conference, the fascist tripartite group thought it could run rampant throughout the world. However, the facts have clearly told Japan that the British and Americans have financially supported China, and the dream of controlling all of China is difficult to realize. Moreover, China can obtain effective assistance from the Soviet Union. At the same time, the Japanese army has made no new progress since capturing Guangzhou and Hankou. Guangzhou is often threatened by counterattacks from the elite Chinese army. The attacks on Jiangxi and Hunan provinces have also stalled. Several attempts to attack western China and cut off China's transportation links with the Soviet Union have long failed. Economically, the result of developing China's resources is nothing more than adding to the disappointment, because Chinese farmers and workers are refusing to cooperate. In the "Manchukuo," the lack of manpower is very obvious, local peace cannot be maintained, and it is often threatened by the Eighth Route Army—all of these are preventing the development of Manchuria. As for Japan itself, the war has brought the people intolerable hardships. The mysterious fires and explosions can lead us to believe that the "silent masses" of Japan cannot remain silent forever.

Now is the best time for China to receive financial assistance, and it is also the best time for the powers to provide assistance. Japan is anxious to win before this summer and is gradually feeling uneasy, because the "China Incident" will be prolonged for longer than Japan's financial strength can support. The British and American loans to China, whether commercial or political, are indeed a blow to Japan.

Soong Ching-ling Presents Banners

Distributes to Five Women's Organizations

Madam Sun Soong Ching-ling then stepped onto the stage amid applause and said, "When I came to Hong Kong from Shanghai, I often heard statements that the work of women's organizations here was scattered and disorganized. At that time, I felt that it was indeed necessary to unite because unity is strength. Since the establishment of the Sino-American-French Charity Bazaar Committee, I have learned of the efforts of various organizations. To express my gratitude, I especially represent the Sino-American-French Bazaar Committee to present banners to the Women's Comfort Association, the War Relief Association, the New Movement Association, the Women's Association, and the Young Women's Christian Association," etc. The banners were made of red satin and praised as "Striving for National Salvation."

### Hong Kong Goods Blocked from Guangdong Ports, Business Severely Affected; Developing Markets in Southeast Asia

Since the Japanese army stepped into South China, Hong Kong's land and water transportation with the mainland has been cut off, with only the Hong Kong-Macau route still able to communicate with the mainland. Furthermore, the coastal roads in Eastern Guangdong, Chaoshan, and Southern Guangdong have been destroyed, causing great inconvenience. Coupled with the recent escalation of naval blockades in the South, the import of foreign goods and industrial products from Hong Kong to the mainland has come to a standstill. According to people in the industry who have been importing foreign goods and Hong Kong-made products, the business of most companies has been suspended for the past three to four months. Nowadays, foreign goods are rarely seen in the markets of the four rural districts of the mainland. Foreign companies and agents in Hong Kong have suffered significant setbacks. At the same time, many small industrial factories in Hong Kong, which rely on the mainland market as their backbone, have also been significantly affected. In order to maintain their own businesses, in addition to reducing the number of employees and saving daily expenses, they are actively seeking development in Southeast Asia, selling their products in large quantities to Southeast Asia to offset past losses.

### Two Police Officers Exchange Fire with Three Robbers Outside San Tin Village in the New Territories; Midnight Action, Police Anticipate and Shoot First; Gunfire Exchanged for Over Ten Minutes, Robbers Manage to Escape

At 1:50 AM yesterday, Chinese police officers Yang Jiu and Wu Hua from the Lok Ma Chau Police Station in the New Territories were patrolling outside San Tin Village when they suddenly saw three robbers dressed in black approaching. Their movements were unusually furtive. The two police officers were highly suspicious and immediately shouted to question them, intending to search them. Unexpectedly, before the two police officers finished shouting, the three robbers quickly dispersed and opened fire on the police officers, almost ambushing them. At that time, the two police officers, for self-defense, also drew their guns and returned fire. Both sides exchanged shots, and the gunfire sounded like a string of pearls. The villagers, startled by such loud gunfire in the middle of the night, thought that a major incident had occurred and woke up from their dreams, quietly watching to see what was happening. After more than ten minutes, the gunfire stopped. The three robbers had already disappeared without a trace after the gunfire stopped. Yang and Wu pursued them without success and returned to the station to report. The officer on duty, deeply concerned that the criminals might be plotting something sinister in the middle of the night, immediately mobilized all Chinese and Indian detectives to search the area, but the three robbers had already vanished.

### Commemoration of "March 8th"

— Yin Xia

A Lively Scene That Set a Record for the Hong Kong Women's Movement

As the War of Resistance has entered a more difficult stage, "March 8th" International Women's Day has arrived again. In order to further awaken women of all social strata in Hong Kong and embark on the path of freedom and liberation, more than forty women's organizations in Hong Kong have united together to plan and expand the commemoration of this day of women's liberation. The commemoration meeting was held at Lee Theatre. Chinese women leaders and all the women leaders in Hong Kong gathered together, a lively situation that created a new record in the history of the Hong Kong women's movement.

It was a clear morning. In the Lee Theatre by Jardine's Corner, female students wearing blue school uniforms, female workers wearing new homespun clothes, and women leaders wearing floral red, purple, and green gowns, groups of people, one after another, gathered. Before long, the second floor and the lobby were already densely packed.

Standing at attention in silence, the opening ceremony proceeded item by item. Next, Chairperson He Yuying delivered the opening address. A middle-aged woman of short stature took the stage with a dignified and gentle demeanor. In a fluent and brisk tone, she first described the origin of the March 8th International Women's Day, and put forward the "two major goals of the March 831 Women's Day" which are to protect women's rights and improve women's status. Then she explained that the world war situation is so dangerous, and women all over the world should actively stand up to uphold justice, promote peace, and practice self-discipline and service. If the women of the world, who account for half of humanity, can do this, the days of human mutual massacre may be avoided.

Speaking of the status of women in Hong Kong, she believes that it has improved a lot. At the same time, with the outbreak of the War of Resistance, women in Hong Kong can unite even more to donate money, donate medicine, raise orphans, and carry out various national salvation movements. This is a good phenomenon in Hong Kong's women's community. "However, that is still not enough!" She emphasized, "We should more deeply recognize that the War of Resistance period is an opportunity for women to seek liberation. Therefore, we must be more diligent and self-sacrificing. In the era of the great War of Resistance, we can share the joys and sorrows with men and share the hardships together. In the new China in the future, we will definitely be able to share glory and rights with men." She finished in one breath and sat down amidst continuous applause!

Next was a speech by Ms. He Xiangning. She is a pioneer in the Chinese women's liberation movement, and it is unnecessary for us to further introduce her. Although she is so old and her hair is already gray, her bright eyes, her lively mouth, and her fighting spirit all demonstrate the vitality of youth. She moved to the front and first talked about the history of "March 8th" Women's Day in China. Then she said, "When we commemorate the fallen soldiers and the deceased compatriots for three minutes, in that moment, we think of our sisters in the occupied areas, ××××××××××××××, and we feel infinitely sad and infinitely painful. We must resolve to avenge their humiliation, ×××××!" She spoke these words with too much force. Have you ever seen the tension of a warrior at the moment of life and death, when he is writing his will? "×××"! Everyone in the audience felt their blood rushing and their hair standing on end!

Speaking of how we women should strive to fight, she took a light breath and said, "We certainly want to fight for our equal status with men, but this is only for personal enjoyment, only for personal gain. If we want to achieve our freedom and equality, we must first obtain the freedom and equality of the nation." A burst of warm applause interrupted her. "I hope that everyone present today, especially the students, will actively promote and awaken all the women in Hong Kong, and extend it further to awaken the women all over the country, and rise up to fight for the freedom and equality of the nation!" She said forcefully, her hands trembling with excitement.

Speaking of the women residing in Hong Kong, she said in a sad tone, "Although the women residing in Hong Kong are so close to the motherland, the tragic facts can almost be heard and seen, but what I know is that many women are still indulging in pleasure day and night, pleasure!" Saying this, many people in the audience looked around, as if searching for something. In fact, some people were already blushing. In a calm atmosphere, she continued: "I hope everyone can wake up in time and use this kind of useful money to help our suffering compatriots and contribute to the country."

"The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of everyone," but the responsibility of women can be said to be even greater than that of men. How can this be said? If all the men in the country are killed, we women in the rear will also need to go to the front line to fight. I think that on average, one in ten women is pregnant, and that will add hundreds of thousands of soldiers in a few years!" A burst of light laughter interrupted her. After a pause, she continued: "I hope the female compatriots will rise up to fight!" The applause was as intense as firecrackers during the New Year. Almost everyone in the audience was moved to tears.

After the speech, the resolution to send a telegram to the National Government and the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission was passed. Everyone in the audience warmly applauded in support. At this time, Ms. He Xiangning stood up, ran to the microphone, and shouted loudly, "Starting from today, should all the women's organizations in Hong Kong commemorating the March 8th Festival form a Hong Kong Women's National Salvation Federation?" Good! Another burst of warm applause!

During Ms. He Xiangning's speech, Madam Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, quietly arrived. Thousands of eyes were fixed on her, as if she possessed rare treasures. She humbly sat in the third row of chairs. Unable to resist the earnest invitations from everyone, she finally took the stage and sat down. She was wearing a black cheongsam and a flannel coat, showing her calm dignity. She always smiled when talking to people, revealing her snow-white teeth. Her attitude was so gentle and amiable. Every word and gesture vividly demonstrated her unwavering vitality. The impression she gave us was noble, amiable, great, and outstanding.

The reporter asked her to express her opinion on the Hong Kong women's movement. She hesitated for a moment and said, "She has an article to publish about this tomorrow, so she has no opinion!" In fact, she didn't say much at the meeting because she doesn't like to talk much! Only when she presented banners to the three women's associations did she simply say, "During the Sino-British-French association, the five women's organizations united together and were able to exert their great working efficiency!" Although these were just a few words, they were weighty. The women's organizations in Hong Kong really need to unite and fight!

After the awards ceremony, the commemoration came to an end. Then there was entertainment. The one-act play "Chinese Sons and Daughters" was performed by the Guangdong Opera Association, and the results and effects were very satisfactory. Madam Sun and Mrs. Peel also stayed to enjoy the show. After the play ended and the audience dispersed, the commemoration of the March 8th Festival came to an end. Cai Lusheng

### "March 8th" Festival in Ap Lei Chau: An Unprecedented Mass Gathering of Women

— Cai Lusheng

Yesterday, women's organizations in Hong Kong enthusiastically and solemnly held celebrations simultaneously in five districts to commemorate the great anniversary of women around the world fighting for freedom and liberation – "International Women's Day." I attended the celebration in Ap Lei Chau, one of Hong Kong's three major fishing areas, across from Aberdeen, about half an hour's "bus" ride from the central district of Hong Kong. Because of the universality and popularization of the event, it gave the people in this culturally backward fishing area boundless excitement!

The event was sponsored by the "Ap Lei Chau Women's Group," composed of mass women such as fishermen and peddlers, together with intellectual women. The venue was a vast open space surrounded by fishermen drying a lot of seafood. A large bamboo stage was erected at the southern part of the space, and rows of long benches were neatly arranged in front of the stage. In addition to the necessary national flag and the portrait of the Premier hung on the stage, the space below was also filled with colorful slogans, such as: "Remember the March 8th Festival, don't forget the thousands of women at the front being ravaged by the × army; and the thousands of women in the rear being bombed by × planes!" "For the work of resisting Japan and building the nation, we women must work together with men!" "Buy fewer cosmetics and you can increase national strength!" What thought-provoking sentences!

Because the venue was in an open space, anyone could have the opportunity to participate. Before the meeting even started, it was already crowded with people – including the "Tanka women" and peddlers, merchants, and intellectuals who have always been "discriminated" against; and also noble ladies. In Ap Lei Chau, which has always been desolate and remote, this can be considered a grand and unprecedented gathering of women!

At a little after ten in the morning, the conference opened. After the ceremony, Ms. Yu Fengning, the chairman, delivered the opening speech – elaborating on the history and significance of the "March 8th" Festival in a penetrating and detailed manner, which received a lot of warm applause. Following that, Ms. Chen Yun, representing the "March 8th" Preparatory Committee, gave a speech on the progress made in the country in the military and political spheres during the twenty months of the War of Resistance, and the improvement of the international situation; and then on how women should position themselves today to make themselves a "person" and jointly shoulder the sacred task of resisting Japan with men. She also encouraged everyone to learn from the bravery of Zhao Laotaitai, the mother of the guerrillas, and to fight for the liberation of women and the liberation of the nation! This garnered even more enthusiastic applause from the audience.

After several other women representatives also expressed their opinions one after another, the entertainment began. First, the women's group of the Life Choir sang: "The Army Marches On," "We Need War"..., filling the entire venue with a generous and passionate sound that deeply moved everyone. Next was the performance by the Ap Lei Chau Women's Group, a one-act play "Freedom?". It was performed by Ms. Yu Fengning, the chairman of the conference, and Ms. Wu Qianqing, the backbone of the Women's Group, etc. Ms. Wu played a male role in reverse. Although it was difficult to distinguish between male and female, it made many innocent and simple fishermen laugh heartily, but the effect was very good. The third program was "The Cry of Women" performed by Ms. Zheng Min and others from the group. The performance was very energetic. The fourth program was a tableau performance of the Song of the Great Wall. Because the performance was so sincere, not only did the performers cry, but many audience members – especially women, were moved to tears and threw "mao zhi" (small denomination coins) and "cents" onto the stage. There were many other interesting programs, which cannot be fully recorded here due to space constraints. In short, the holding of this conference has awakened the women of Ap Lei Chau – especially the women of the poorer classes – from the darkness. In the near future, they will surely be able to prove in fact how they are following this great March 8th Women's Movement and striving to become a "person" – a healthy "person" who can jointly shoulder the burden of fighting for national freedom and liberation with men!

### Guangdong × Has a Major Tendency to Invade the West, We are Determined to Crush the Conspiracy of × to Invade Guilin, Guerrillas are Doubly Active, Repeatedly Annihilating Stubborn × in the Rear, Sanshui × Has Been Peeping and Harassing Our Coastline for Days Without Success

[Xijiang Fast Report] Since the × army on the Xijiang front has recently deployed a unit to increase defenses, they have been busy building pontoon bridges and constructing trenches and fortresses in various strongholds every day, seemingly preparing for a major invasion of the west. Therefore, the defense of the west line has become slightly tense. Generals Rao Xia and Deng Longguang of the Guizhou Province, who are responsible for defending the Xijiang, have requested instructions from He, the Southwest Commander-in-Chief, to seize the opportunity to kill the × enemy. Director Bai has a complete offensive and defensive plan for the military affairs of the Guangdong-West and Jiangnan Roads to crush the conspiracy of the × people to invade Guilin. The following is a record of the recent situation of × and us in Xijiang.

Large Army Guards the Southwest Road of Xijiang

Recently, it was rumored that × chieftain An Tenghui requested from the × headquarters to increase the number of three divisions to Guangdong, attempting to use force to make Guilin. The news was rampant. Director Bai Chongxi of the Southwest Commander-in-Chief had already made a great determination to aid Guangdong and protect Guilin. No matter whether the Guangdong × invaded Guilin by advancing along the Xijiang River or by landing on the southern road for a roundabout attack, there were strict defenses to prevent them. × will never succeed. The elite Wei Yunsong unit of Guizhou Province has been transferred to Qinzhou and other areas in southern Guangdong to strengthen the defense of the border between Guizhou and Guangdong. Our large army is gathered along the Xijiang River, and the defense is particularly strong. × dare not risk an attack.

Guerrillas Repeatedly Annihilate × in the Rear

After General Deng Longguang, the commander of the × army, moved his troops to the Xijiang River, in order to launch a large-scale guerrilla war to cooperate with the regular army's plan to attack the ×, he recently sent a large number of plainclothes guerrillas to the occupied areas from Sanshui Hekou Southwest to Foshan to carry out extensive propaganda to the villagers and persuade them to join the guerrillas to kill the ×. It is now found that our plainclothes guerrillas have penetrated deep into the rear of the × people and are extremely active. In the Foshan area, the misleading slogans posted by Li Daoyi, the pseudo-administrative commissioner of Nanhai, have been torn down by our guerrillas for days. At the same time, the pseudo-self-defense corps and × sentries have also been repeatedly killed. The × bandits entrenched in Foshan are panicked. Our guerrillas' strategy of disrupting the violent × by penetrating deep into the rear has achieved considerable success.

Sanshui × Army Peeps and Harasses the Coast

It was also found that after the increase of the × troops on the Sanshui front, they have been strengthening their defenses at various strongholds near Hekou, Zhennan, Xinxu, and Ganggen, Makou, Jiaowei, and Laoyazhou for days, and erecting floating bridges. On the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of this month, the Haikou and Ganggen Makou × troops sent infantry and cavalry to forcibly pull laborers from nearby villages to transport wood and erect military bridges. It is estimated that more than 300 people have been forcibly conscripted in recent days. According to intelligence, there are now × motorized boats and rubber boats, Chuan ships, and seven or eight electric boats berthed near Zhennan Xinxu and 口. On the 6th and 9th, the × motorized boats patrolled along the river, searching around Ganggen Makou and the old Ershui Jiaowei Laoyazhou area to search for our guerrillas. On the 6th, some × soldiers from the 墟 area rode motorized boats to Jiaowei to land and increase defenses. That night, two × motorized boats, each carrying dozens of × soldiers, sailed from Jiaowei towards Qingqi, using searchlights to illuminate and spy along the coast. Our sentries, believing that the × boats were harassing, strictly monitored them. The × soldiers, not seeing any movement and not knowing our reality, did not dare to approach the shore and sailed downstream.

Jiujiang Stubborn × Builds Defenses and Guards

Also, on the downstream of the Xijiang River, in the Jiujiang Heqing area, on the 4th, more than 100 × soldiers came to the two Longs from the Jiangfo Lu Ba Jiashui Teng. Currently, there are more than 500 × soldiers in Jiujiang Shakou Heqing. Apart from actively building defenses in recent days, there have been no other unusual movements. On the night of the 5th, more than ten × motorized boats sailed to Jiujiang to unload military supplies and forcibly conscripted our strong men to dig trenches along the coast of Shakou Heqing. There were no other changes. However, there were sporadic gunshots from the front line, which seemed to be fired by our guerrillas attacking the ×.

### Our Army on the Northeast Road Liaisons to Encircle Zengcheng, Although × Gathers in Zengcheng, They Dare Not Act Rashly, Dongbao Huibo Are All Solidly Defended

[Shenzhen Quick Report] The situation in Dongjiang has been uncertain for the past week, with frequent troop movements and fluctuating troop strength in the strongholds of Zengcheng, Shilong, Wancheng, and Taiping. Although the situation in the Zeng (cheng) Cong (hua) area seems slightly tense after the recent × gathering of troops in Zengcheng, the Dong (guan) Hui (yang) Bo (luo) area is still extremely peaceful. The military and civilians in various places are busy strengthening their defenses and resisting the ×. The following is a record of the situation in Dongjiang obtained here in the past two days.

Our Army Strictly Controls Zengcheng

It was found that the × army has been transporting troops from the Guangzeng Highway and the Zengtan Highway to Zengcheng, Zengkou, Fuhe, Zhucun, Shiqiao, and Shigang for days, increasing the number of × soldiers. However, Wu Qiwei, the commander-in-chief of our East Road, and Yu Hanmou, the commander-in-chief of the North Road, have already issued orders to transfer elite troops to be stationed in Longmen Boluo Conghua and other areas, adopting close liaison to strictly encircle and control the × army in Zengcheng. It will be difficult for the × to break through and flee. According to information received from a certain agency, the number of × in Zengcheng has increased, but they know that our large army is gathered, so they have not dared to act rashly in the past two days. Our positions are solid and our morale is high.

Dongbao's Defense is Becoming More Stable

In addition, except for Wancheng, Shilong, and Taiping, which are occupied by the ×, there are no × traces in the rest of the Dongguan territory, the downstream of the Dongjiang River, Mas, Qishi, Longjiao, Jitou, Tiangang, and Qiaotou. Although the areas adjacent to Dongguan City, Taiping, and Shilong are constantly harassed and threatened by the × army, the × army does not dare to occupy them. The pseudo-maintenance committees of various villages that were threatened by the × a few days ago have now disintegrated one after another, and the people are also enthusiastically joining the guerrillas to kill the ×. Therefore, most of the Dongguan County territory is still in the hands of our army. Zhang Wodong, the deputy commander of the Fourth Guerrilla Area and the county magistrate of Dongguan, is now actively promoting the Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Movement among the people in the occupied and non-occupied areas. As for the Baoan County territory, there are no × traces now. The × army has been spreading rumors of a renewed invasion of Baoan every day, but our teams have already strengthened their defenses with real knives. If the × invade, they will be severely attacked at any time. Zhang Wodong Liang 仁 , the two county magistrates, have also been discussing the measures to defend against ×, eliminate bandits, and maintain law and order for days. Therefore, the defense of the two counties of Dongbao is becoming more and more solid.

It is Rumored that More than 10,000 × Troops are Coming to Guangdong for Reinforcement

According to intelligence, An Teng, the head of the southern invasion ×, has requested assistance from the × country in view of the long east, west, and north Jiang front lines after launching the military operation to invade Hainan Island, the insufficient distribution of troops, and the pressure from our large army. In order to consolidate the original points and lines and prevent our large army from attacking and seize the opportunity for a final struggle, many × ships have arrived in the Pearl River one after another, carrying more than 10,000 × soldiers. One part has landed in Huangpu Humen and is reinforcing the east, west, and north Jiangs, and the other part is reinforcing Hainan Island.

### The National Economic Construction Commission Promotes International Trade, Organizes Joint Venture Companies, and Will Develop to Overseas Areas

[Shaoguan Correspondence] Since its establishment, the National Economic Construction Commission has been actively promoting the development of domestic economic affairs. In view of improving the quality of domestic goods and promoting the number of outbound sales, it has initiated the organization of a China National Products Joint Venture Company to promote international trade and exchange foreign exchange from overseas. The company's recent work plan is as follows: 1. Prepare for the establishment of national product companies in various places, and formulate the guidelines for the articles of association of national product companies in various places, the "Outline of Joint Taiwan Measures" and the "Organization Procedures." 2. Prepare for the establishment of national product stores in various places, and formulate the "Measures for National Product Stores in Various Places" and the "Outline of Joint Business Measures." 3. Act as an agent for public and private institutions and groups to purchase large quantities of domestic goods, including "Measures for Purchasing Large Quantities of Domestic Goods." 4. Undertake the promotion and sale of domestic goods entrusted by domestic goods manufacturers, and formulate an outline of a promotion cooperation method. Since the War of Resistance, the company, in view of the increasing enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for using domestic goods, has planned to contact local overseas Chinese to jointly initiate organizations in overseas areas in order to promote international trade and exchange foreign exchange. It plans to initiate them in Southeast Asia first, and plans to gradually plan to establish them in places such as Batavia, Manila, and Bangkok. In addition to the company first recognizing one-quarter or one-third of the subscribed capital, the rest will be provided by enthusiastic overseas Chinese or banks in each location. This is really enough to develop international trade and reverse the trade deficit.

The Market Situation Plummeted

### The Fifth District of Shunde Suffered a Catastrophe, The Place Has Become a Place of媚 to Seek Full-time Retribution

Since × occupied the area along the Fojiang Highway in the Fifth District of Shunde, its transportation has been greatly threatened by our guerrillas' attacks and sabotage from time to time. Recently, due to our large-scale counter-offensive, fearing that they would be intercepted by our guerrilla teams when retreating, they dispatched the Nanhai Pseudo-Political Police Force and the original Nanhai Detective Team, etc., a total of about 300 traitors, local bandits, and soldiers, led by the × chieftain, Captain Dashi, claiming to sweep away our guerrilla teams, and肆 to villages near the highway. When × arrived at Xinlong Township, the villagers immediately fled in investigation. Only three servants were guarding the township office. ×

, then proceeded to Dalou Township. When they arrived at the edge of Dalou Township, a local bandit named Li of the township contacted × in the name of the chairman of the township maintenance committee. × then ordered him to lead the way into the village. When they reached the bridgehead in the center of the village, the traitorous bandits and × soldiers looted the property of each store, causing huge losses. After × looted the area, they proceeded to Laocun Township along Daoxiang Township. At that time, the people of Laocun Township did not know that × was acting so × in Dalou Township. Therefore, ×× Lao×× Lao×× Liang and others recognized them as members of the township maintenance committee and went out of the village to greet them in advance. After × entered the village, they made a brief patrol and looted the wealthy households and overseas Chinese residences on Changtang Street, causing a loss of no less than tens of thousands of yuan. One day, × surrounded Yuebu in four routes from Lanshi and Shuiteng. He and other traitors in the township immediately welcomed × into the village in separate ways. After × entered the village, they repeated the old trick and looted the village, even taking away towels and cigarettes. After × finished looting, they fled back to Lanshi along Yuanji. When they arrived at Xiaoyong Township,節After the area was轮 through, farmers and merchants, etc., had already fled. The local security was lacking people in charge, and local bandits took the opportunity to纠 gang and拦 to intercept and rob,打 at night. Those who could not escape had to suffer再 bandits, which can be described as tragic.

The Market Situation Remains Desolate

As for the general market situation, various entertainment venues are still very deserted. × once forced the cinemas to reopen, claiming that if they did not comply, they would强 disturb their business. One was indeed forced at the time, but it was still closed due to the lack of films. Only a few restaurants, such as Jinlong, Jinlun, and Dasanyuan, are open. Although some stores have reopened, most of them have been forced to. Guangzhou used to have many foreign goods stores, but now they have been replaced by hundreds of × stores, selling × goods.

### The Food Problem in Chaozhou

— Zhang Wenqiang

The grain production in Chaozhou and Shantou is not as much as the people of Chaozhou and Shantou eat. The insufficient amount has always been supplied by importing national rice from southern Fujian and various provinces in the Yangtze River Basin, as well as rice from 安 两 , Siam, Yangon and other places. Therefore, before the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Chaozhou and Shantou, due to their geographical location on the coast and convenient transportation, could always get a continuous supply of foreign rice regardless of the local harvest, with only expensive rice and no rice famine. However, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, especially after the abandonment of Wuhan and the fall of Guangzhou, the transportation lines between Chaozhou and Shantou and the domestic rice-producing areas, except for a corner of southern Fujian, have been cut off by the enemy, and it is extremely difficult to transport foreign rice into Chaozhou and Shantou. The cost of various foreign rice has skyrocketed due to the relative devaluation of the national currency, and the cost calculated in foreign currency has skyrocketed. The price of sales in the country is too high, and merchants have no profit to seek, and imports have almost disappeared. Therefore, three months ago, even shortly after the winter harvest in Chaozhou and Shantou, the price of rice skyrocketed unprecedentedly, with each yuan buying only six or seven catties or so. The increased burden on the poor and the difficulty of life have been enough to weaken the strength of the War of Resistance. In the future, there will be more and more rice shortages. If the people's food is cut off, the self-reliance of Chaozhou and Shantou, and even the overall situation of the War of Resistance, will be affected. The food problem in Chaozhou and Shantou is really very serious and worthy of everyone's attention, research, and solutions.

At present, the food problem in Chaozhou and Shantou only has the phenomenon of expensive rice and has not yet developed into the degree of rice famine. Stabilizing the price of rice and relieving the suffering of the people is indeed the urgent demand of the people. How to prevent rice famine is even more of a "sufficient food" problem that is as important as "sufficient soldiers" in today's increasingly urgent policy of the enemy's southward invasion!

The population of Chaozhou and Shantou is about 4.5 million, and the annual consumption of rice is about 9.157 million dan. The rice produced by each county in Chaozhou and Shantou is only 7.4 million dan per year, with a deficit of about 1.75 million dan. In addition, most of the rice shortage in the counties of Meizhou is also purchased and supplied by rice merchants in Shantou. According to statistics, the amount of rice that needs to be supplemented from outside in Chaozhou and Meizhou each year is about 3.6 million dan. Before foreign rice was taxed, most of these 3.6 million dan of rice were supplied by Annam Siam Yangon and other places. After foreign rice was taxed, most of them were supplied by domestic rice. Xiang rice was transported from Changsha to Shantou via Guangzhou via the Yuehan Railway, and rice from Jiangsu and Anhui provinces was exported from Shanghai and shipped to Shantou by sea. Now that the Guangdong-汉 railway transportation has been interrupted, Xiang rice can absolutely not be transported to Shantou for sale. Although 50,000 to 60,000 bags of rice from Jiangsu and Anhui provinces exported through Shanghai have been transported to Shantou in the past month, which is the largest source of food for Chaozhou and Shantou, the enemy is jealous and has now begun to prevent Su rice from being transported to Shantou. Now the authorities in Fujian Province have also banned the transportation of rice out of the province, and the supply of domestic rice for the people's food in Chaozhou and Shantou has been cut off. If we do not take steps to save the situation as soon as possible, there is indeed a possibility that a severe rice famine will form in Chaozhou and Shantou.

The only way to prevent a rice famine in Chaozhou and Shantou is to open up the source of foreign rice. The reason why foreign rice cannot be imported in large quantities has been mentioned earlier, because the cost is too high. The reason why the cost is high is the high exchange rate and the collection of tariffs. To enable foreign rice to be imported, we must of course find ways to reduce its cost. The level of the exchange rate is a financial problem of the entire country, and it cannot be shifted with the local food problem. To reduce the cost of foreign rice, all we can do is to temporarily exempt the import tax on foreign rice, (to be continued)

Movies and Drama

### The Wife of an Arms Dealer: Hedy Lamarr

Twenty-three-year-old Hedy Lamarr is a dazzling, top-tier star in Hollywood, in the United States, and on screens worldwide. However, her past is a heart-wrenching novel. For seven years, she struggled to free herself from dire circumstances, and through her own efforts, she finally turned her long-held dream into reality. Here, we start from her starring role in her first film, "Ecstasy."

At that time, she was only sixteen years old, a girl who didn't fully understand the ways of the world. She signed the acting contract somewhat confusedly, not realizing how much this event would reshape her life. She grew to dislike the nude and romantic scenes in the film, not knowing that this was the starting point for her future fame.

Moreover, this film caused resentment from her parents, especially her father, a distinguished Viennese banker. Hedy said, "Lawyers advised him to make a statement about this, but he refused, because the film wasn't very famous at that time. Doing so would only attract more attention from pleasure-seekers."

He was wrong. The film eventually became a huge sensation in Europe, winning honors. Afterwards, it also gained significant attention in the United States.

After the film was completed, Hedy went to Vienna to live with her parents, hoping to alleviate their worries somewhat. Soon after, she stepped onto the stage, taking on the role of Empress Elisabeth in the local production of "Empress Elisabeth," and received another warm welcome.

Around this time, she often received flowers. Each time, among the large bouquets of fresh flowers, there was always one bouquet with the name "Fritz Mandl" attached. This person requested a meeting with her. Although Hedy remembered having such an admirer, she had never given him a response. Eventually, they finally met at her home, introduced by her mother.

He was a person who never stopped until he achieved his goals. In Europe, his name was often shrouded in an aura of mystery. To put it more clearly, he was a famous arms dealer, a powerful behind-the-scenes figure, a man with a heart of stone.

At their first meeting, he asked her directly, "You've certainly heard of me, haven't you?"

Hedy smiled, "Of course—but not particularly good things."

The environment had changed her, enabling her to skillfully handle every visitor or those who fell in love with her. She always avoided those with obvious ambitions, otherwise, she would face more trouble.

However, upon meeting Fritz, she felt an irresistible force. His formidable intelligence, various talents, love of sports, and his unique, assertive courtship all combined to make him such an active and energetic man that she inevitably, unconsciously, fell in love with him.

The wedding was quiet. Hedy was completely immersed in love, neglecting her future destiny.

After the marriage, Fritz kept her like a caged bird, giving her a separate residence. Everything she wanted, he would fulfill. Well, shouldn't a woman be content with this?

But no, he provided everything she needed, yet he handled these matters in the same way he ran his arms business. This was his biggest mistake. He was the master of his kingdom, giving orders to servants, giving orders to Hedy, giving orders to everyone. He was truly like an emperor, and Hedy was the empress. The empress had no real power.

Could Hedy truly stay in this kind of life for long? She was ambitious and had an early desire to become a Hollywood star. But now, after marriage, she spent her days in this luxurious but unfree life, becoming Fritz's prisoner, slowly being forgotten by the outside world.

Now, Hedy could talk about these things without hesitation, but when she was still a queen in the forbidden palace, she didn't even dare to say an extra word. Her phone was tapped, and she was secretly watched wherever she went. It was absolutely forbidden to dance twice with the same man. Fritz married her to monopolize her, and he wanted her to think the same way. Another woman might have had her life ruined under the same treatment, but not Hedy. Although she had been forced to stay at home, quietly being a prisoner, for quite a long time, she finally couldn't bear it anymore. She wanted to seek help from her parents, but unfortunately, her father was suffering from severe heart disease at that time, so she couldn't even tell him about it. Until one night, her father passed away, she felt that this was the time to escape, otherwise, she would be drowned by the "sea of sorrow" he had created sooner or later.

Even now, Hedy still doesn't dare to reveal who helped her escape from Vienna, and she herself didn't dare to be sure that she was safe until she set foot on the soil of London. This shows how much she feared her husband and his special, prison-like affection.

With a shattered heart, she met the film industry mogul Louis B. Mayer and his wife on the banks of the Thames. The flame of her desire to become a star was rekindled, and wasn't America farther away from her husband? So she immediately decided to sail to America with the Mayers. On the way, at Mrs. Mayer's suggestion, she changed her name from Hedy Kiesler to Hedy Lamarr, the name of the great movie star to come.

When she arrived in Hollywood, she began to study acting and English. Her childishness hadn't changed, and she preferred to go to the cinema to learn English rather than sit face-to-face with her private tutor. Of course, this didn't yield good results, so she couldn't get any roles for a long time. Eventually, even the people at MGM believed that she would soon be sent back to Europe.

About eight months later, she was discovered by Charles Boyer at a party. At that time, he had already been assigned as the male lead in "Algiers," but the female lead had not yet been decided. Hedy had only met him for a short while before he recommended her to Walter Wanger, the producer of the film.

"She's perfect for our female lead, don't you think?"

The producer looked at her and thought that might be true. So Hedy was temporarily borrowed to do a few screen tests with other people. After testing ten people, Hedy was officially borrowed to play the female lead in "Algiers."

As soon as this film came out, her reputation surpassed that of Charles Boyer. Although she had little acting experience and almost no close-ups of her alone in the entire film, the worst criticism against her was only that "she wasn't acting, and the film didn't show that she was a good actress, but we don't care about these things." In the end, she was still embraced.

Frank Borzage is the director of her new film "I Take This Woman." He is trying his best to make this film a great success, and MGM is also paying special attention to her. We hope she has better performances, and her future is limitless.

She has an elegant new house, furnished with the latest furniture, and hopes to bring her mother to live with her as soon as possible.

Because she and Reginal Gardiner are very close, she often visits him in the hospital when he is injured. There is some speculation outside again. However, although Hedy has a passionate personality, she also has a calm judgment. This matter is probably not what people generally think.

### Hong Kong Football Team to Visit the Philippines in Return Match; Fifteen Players Internally Selected; Li Huitang and Yige Shan'nu Included in the Internal List

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) During the Lunar New Year, the Hong Kong-Philippines Inter-City Football Match saw the Philippine team lose all three games and return south defeated. However, although they gained nothing in the competition, the large number of spectators resulted in ticket revenue totaling over 12,900 yuan for the three games. This excellent result was truly unexpected. Therefore, although the Philippine team suffered complete defeat, they returned satisfied.

The Hong Kong team is scheduled to visit the Philippines in return in late April. At yesterday's (6th) General Meeting, it was decided that the Hong Kong team would travel on the President Cleveland ship on April 28 and return to Hong Kong on the Pacific ship from the Philippines on May 10. As for the selection of players, the Management Committee will be responsible for handling it.

Yesterday, the Management Committee held a meeting to discuss the selection of representatives and internally selected fifteen players, including Tam Kwun-kan (South China Chinese), Li Tiansheng (South China South), Shi Han (Middlesex), Fizz Walter (Middlesex), Liang Rongzhao (South China South), Lie Li (Navy), Yamba Chen (Artillery Team), Feng Jingxiang (South China South), Li Huitang (Chinese YMCA), Yige Shan'nu (St. Joseph's), Kent Di (Navy), Hou Rongsheng (Kwang Wah), Yi Shi Du Lanchi (Hong Kong Club), Mu Ni (Middlesex), and Li Zhaorong (South China South).

However, this is an internal selection and not a final decision. Their opinions will be sought first to see who can travel and who cannot. Then, another selection meeting will be held. Therefore, although the internal selection is currently as such, whether there will be any changes in the future depends on their responses. (The Old Man of the Stadium)

### Looking Back and Forward

— Lai Duanfu

On the 4th of this month, Eastern, emboldened by their unprecedented victory over South China South, crossed the sea to battle Kowloon Club but were unable to win. I regret this. Examining the reason for their sluggish performance in the first half, it lies in the sudden use of Xu Jingcheng to return to the center forward position, while using Chen Yutian, who hadn't played for a long time, as a forward. If they had continued to fight with their existing formation, victory would have been assured. Instead, because of the draw, they lost another point, and their hopes for second place are now very slim. However, yesterday South China Chinese surprisingly defeated the Navy. This not only benefited South China South but also Eastern. I hope that Eastern can find their future direction and aim for second place for themselves.

The Chinese Combined Team fought the Governor's Cup on the 5th, falling behind three times, tying four times, and finally winning five to four. People say their courage and determination are commendable. I say they were improper in their approach. The Western Combined Team was hastily assembled and is by no means a strong team. The Chinese Combined Team is the elite of South China and Eastern. They should have achieved a complete and decisive victory. However, in this game, they often fell behind. Logically speaking, if this is their strength, how will they defeat strong teams in the future? Seeing this, I cannot help but worry about the future of the Chinese Combined Team.

Clearly, the Chinese Combined Team is not weak. Their abnormal performance was perhaps accidental. I am eager to see the Chinese Combined Team win all six championships at stake. I believe that the future of the Chinese Combined Team should be improved. For the sake of cooperation, in the future, whether selecting players from South China and Eastern or selecting two from one side and one from the other, it is advisable to have teammates play side by side. Do not have one player from Team A mixed between two players from Team B, leading to a lack of coordination. In the game on the 5th, two Eastern players, wanting to protect each other, actually ran straight from the left end to the right end, and then straight from the right end to the left end to help their teammates. This not only disrupted the formation but also caused the two to run too much, resulting in fatigue. This can serve as a lesson for future team selection.

Li Shuo You was sent off on January 1st and banned from competition until December 31st. Gao Lushi Yihua Gen was sent off on February 25th and also banned from competition until December 31st. It seems that the Football Association only knows about December 31st and nothing else. If that's the case, I suddenly have a strange idea: in the next competition, players with a lot of complaints may as well throw punches at the end of December. Wouldn't they have the hope of serving just a few days of "football jail"? Just kidding.

The Navy is about to go to sea for major exercises. This is a great opportunity for South China South and Eastern to defeat a strong opponent. However, the two Chinese teams should not have the thought of "waiting for good luck." They still need to work hard in practice to defeat strong opponents. Because the Navy will eventually return as a team after the exercises. Although it is said that key players such as Dickson, Hannyville, Tuo Ban, and Kent Di are about to be transferred, the Navy has many strong players. Their movements are uncertain. Even if those players leave, it will not be difficult for them to bring in even better players. Therefore, I believe that if the Chinese teams want to improve, they must implement a "self-reliance" strategy.

South China will clash with Eastern this weekend to compete for the special Silver Shield final. Both are Chinese teams. As neutrals, we will be equally happy no matter which team wins. We only hope that the two teams will focus on the game and performance at that time and not have a repeat of what happened on January 1st this year, giving people a bad impression.

If South China B can defeat the Shiwant team this weekend, they can secure the championship. It is said that South China will use Zhang Manrong as the left winger. This is good news. I hope they will win this time and break the deadlock of our B team not winning the league championship for many years.

### Venue Becomes a Problem; Shanghai Football Tournament Cannot Be Completed; Yiyuan and Racecourse Stadiums to Cease Operations; Over Forty Games Awaiting Rescheduling

[Shanghai News] This year's Western League football tournament has been repeatedly hampered for the past four weeks, with as many as 45 games awaiting rescheduling. The Yiyuan and Racecourse stadiums will cease operations from the 20th of this month (Monday). Only the Jiaozhou Park is available until the end of this month. Therefore, whether it is the league or cup tournament, it is difficult to complete this season. It will likely be stopped midway. According to Mr. Speke, the secretary of the association, they have decided to quickly complete the cup tournament first. Only the finals remain for the Scoto Cup, International Cup, Yu Lin Cup, and Junior Cup. The league matches of each group will also enter the final stage. However, the Group A matches, because they use a round-robin system, are the most difficult to resolve. The Scoto Cup final between the Shanghai Municipal Police and the Western Police team will take place next week. The International Cup final between Portugal and Scotland will be held the week after (i.e., the 18th or 19th). If, unfortunately, there is rain again, the Yu Lin Cup or Junior Cup will also not be completed, it is said.

### South China Chinese's Only Masterpiece This Season; Defeating the Maritime Overlord; Indirectly Benefiting South China South

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The outcome of football matches is difficult to predict. For example, in the Group A league match between South China Chinese and the Navy held at Jia Hill yesterday afternoon, anyone familiar with the current state of football in Hong Kong knows that the Navy has strong strength and is the most likely team to win the championship. In addition, the team is in a serious situation and is working harder to win the championship, with extraordinary ambition. Their past performances have also often been in good condition. Therefore, spectators made a positive prediction for yesterday's game, believing that the Navy would undoubtedly get these two points and that their top position could not be shaken by South China Chinese, who had already lost their championship appearance. The reporter also believed that South China Chinese had more bad luck than good luck, given the team's recent poor performance, frequent personnel changes, and lack of responsibility. What's more, Li Shuo You was suspended, and Yang Shui Yi disappeared. Alas, the phoenix has broken its wings. Liu Yisheng and Lin Depu were also injured and unable to play temporarily. Although South China has many talented players, there is no need to worry about replacements. However, with key players not present, their strength will be weakened. Experts believe that their situation will only worsen and that there will be no more good performances.

When South China Chinese's lineup was first seen yesterday, it was replaced by five or six players from the B team. The formation was incomplete. Spectators who saw this all believed that they would surely lose. The reporter also thought so, believing that their hope of helping their brother team (South China South) would become a dream. With such personnel, how could they resist the strong Navy? It would not only be difficult to win but also difficult to draw. It would be almost impossible not to lose. Who knew that the result of the competition would be the opposite of what we had predicted? The Navy, which was confident of victory and invincible, performed poorly. In the end, South China Chinese scored a goal and lost 1-0. Their championship position was shaken by this loss. Some say that the Navy had bad luck, with an upset occurring. South China Chinese's defeat of this strong opponent, although it does not benefit them directly, does indirectly benefit their brother team. If South China South wins the championship in the future, the contribution of the younger brother team cannot be ignored.

Last season, South China Chinese won the championship, half due to human effort and half due to luck. One reason was that their brother team repeatedly defeated strong opponents, creating their top position. In this season, since the start of the competition until now in May, South China Chinese seems to have been doing nothing right. Therefore, the indirect assistance to their brother team had not been seen before. But yesterday, they made a splash, revived their military might, and defeated the Navy, which was in a high position. This great achievement still shows the attitude of a champion. The value of this victory is not the same as ordinary victories. It greatly helps their brother team and is equivalent to giving them a reassuring pill.

The reasons for the Navy's defeat are threefold: (1) When they first saw South China Chinese using half of their B team players to compete, they had a sense of contempt, believing that it would not be difficult to win the competition. As a result, their players performed poorly. (2) In the first half, the Navy repeatedly attacked without success, achieving nothing. This turned their contempt into anxiety. When they were eager to win in the second half, the more anxious they became, the more chaotic they became, and they were defeated. (3) The three midfielders often went forward to help in the second half, leaving the defense unprotected. South China Chinese took advantage of their empty defense and launched a surprise attack. Their defenders were caught off guard and signed a treaty under the city walls.

South China Chinese did not win because of superior strength, nor did they win because of superior technique. The only factor was the effort of the entire team, fighting to the end, continuing to attack people, and搶抢 for the ball. Therefore, although the Navy gained momentum, their deep incursions were blocked. Even if they shot, they were saved by Tam Kwun-kan. The defense was tight, and no one could enter. In short, South China Chinese's victory was due to courage and diligence. Some say that the performance of South China Chinese's players in this game was brave and resilient, with the style of when they first entered Group A. This is also due to the deployment of many young players.

Now that South China Chinese's wish to benefit their brother team has been fulfilled, it is hoped that the players of South China South will work harder and continue to make efforts to achieve complete success, so as not to let down their brother team's kindness.

Considering the Navy's defeat, bad luck was also a factor. Just look at their attacks in the first half, the momentum of the siege of South China Chinese can be used as proof. At the same time, South China Chinese's right winger Ye Runbo missed opportunities frequently, not only failing to connect with the front line but also dragging down the defense. In the 28th minute of the second half, Yang Genbao shot a fierce ball, and Kotas 士 rushed out of the door. Ye rushed over and could have won with a calm shot. Unexpectedly, the ball flew over the door. The spectators all sighed with regret. Three minutes later, Genbao dribbled the ball male Huai and passed it to Runbo. Runbo 切切中, Dejin rushed forward and headed the ball, creating a miracle. This indirect contribution of Ye is enough to make up for his mistakes.

The most outstanding players for South China Chinese yesterday were Tam Kwun-kan and Chen Dehui. Tam defended in front of the goal, repeatedly defusing dangerous balls. The rest of the players were able to exert all their strength and tenaciously缠绕敌将军, Their功甚伟, It should be encouraged. The Navy's forwards can衝而不擅射, Resulting in常失良机, At the same time, right winger 菲频士Was产伤在足部 in the first half,蹣跚不前, So there was no雁行折冀, In the 18th minute of the second half, although菲频士Switched with肯地, Only奔走不能, Useless, Two minutes before the end of the game, Dragging会曾经有cold射, BothJunkan timelyWith one hand拖出门后, Only负角球, Yiyun fortunately, Here are the球负列后Of both sides,

### Open Tennis Tournament; The Lin Zhen Brothers Win a Hard-Fought Battle Against Guo Liang; A Total of Seven Singles and Doubles Matches Held Today

There were eight singles and doubles matches in yesterday's open tennis tournament. However, the matches were uneventful.

### Construction of Hong Kong Secondary School: Fitness Equipment, Sports Field, Promoting Military Training

Since Mr. Chen Shulin, a Master's degree holder, took over as the principal of Kowloon Heung Kong Middle School, he has been determined to reform the school's administration. The faculty members are all well-known figures from home and abroad. In terms of physical education, experts such as Yu Anbin, Deng Jixi, and Chen Dexin have been hired. It is said that the school's physical education facilities will be implemented based on the principles of militarization. Currently, Deng Jixi and others are responsible for planning the initial implementation guidelines, emphasizing the sound organization of student physical education administration, following the Ministry of Education's standards for primary and secondary school physical education curriculum, and implementing compulsory physical education step by step according to the situation, promoting military training. The results of physical examinations and school certifications will be used to determine the amount of exercise for students. Students with poor physical fitness will be divided into groups for special training. The results of physical education problem tests will be used to understand students' needs and the suitability of the venue, as a basis for providing teaching materials and formulating examination standards, with the application of teaching materials as the training center. Female students will be assisted in adding rhythmic activities and extracurricular activities will be implemented as appropriate, promoting medal sports and strict field life. Preparations are now underway to build a complete equipment and playground, including more than a hundred kinds of light and heavy fitness equipment and correction tools, as well as considerable equipment for military physical education and children's games. It is said that in the future, in addition to providing for the school's staff and parents, it will also be open at specified times to guide public sports.

### Matters to Pay Attention to When Teaching General Exercises

— —Excellence—

(3) Counting off: Counting off is a very important thing in the entire team. In the past, many people adopted the method of forwarding (passing the buck) for counting off. I believe this method of counting off is harmful and not applicable. What is the reason? I will tell everyone three points: A. In close proximity and with a loud voice, there is no need to forward to hear. In the army, this forwarding method of counting off is used at night and with whispered counting to prevent the enemy from knowing. We don't need it. B. Turning back and forth easily hinders the posture and majesty of standing at attention. C. When we count off, we must use all the energy from our dantian to push the sound from the trachea to the throat in order to be loud and resounding. If we make this kind of sound, the top of our head should not be in the normal state but deformed (twisting). On the one hand, it is easy to injure the trachea. On the other hand, the sound produced will not be accurate. Therefore, it is best not to turn your head when counting off.

E. Rhythmic chanting - Regarding the chanting of rhythmic beats, if it can be harmonious with the action, it can originally improve the interest in exercise and increase the efficiency of learning, but improper chanting can also hinder physiology and posture. Therefore, when we exercise, we should pay attention to the following points for chanting in rhythm:

(1) The chanting should be harmonious with the action.

(2) The sound of the chanting should be clear, fast, and strong.

(3) All movements of the torso, head, and neck are not suitable for chanting.

(4) Chanting during rapid exercise is harmful to the lungs and should not be practiced.

(5) Limb exercises should be chanted rhythmically to increase the interest in exercise and help the development of the vocal cords. (3)

### Where is Our Criticism?

— 品品

A few days ago, I met a friend who writes theater reviews. I know he works hard in this area, so I said to him, "You have hope of becoming a film critic." He immediately retorted, "No, no, for the sake of livelihood." Indeed, nowadays, no one can avoid struggling for breadcrumbs, but because of this struggle, good things are simply unseen: the criticism field is also like this.

In newspapers or magazines, I rarely find good critical articles. What I see are just the same old "praise" or "cheers": this is not Criticism but Reviewing. Of course, we don't need introductions. That's for passersby. Where is our criticism?

Criticism—literary criticism, film criticism, book review, theater review—is a department of art. Strictly speaking, before Sainte-Beuve, there was no such thing as criticism. Therefore, criticism only emerged in the 19th century. Although its history is short, it has gradually emerged as an independent discipline: therefore, to write a critique, one must have a certain level of expertise. We all understand: good criticism, like good creation, has a positive force. But what counts as good criticism?

Here, based on Murry's theory, I write down the standards for good criticism below:

First, express the effect and characteristics of the thing being criticized.

Second, trace the origins of this effect and these characteristics, and describe their necessary manifestations.

Third, establish the decisive factors of this captivating power (the author's background can be mentioned).

Fourth, examine the form and technique of the work.

Fifth, a more detailed examination of a particular feature.

Finally, the most important point is that the critic should elevate himself. Let us listen to Murry: "The critic should realize that he is an artist. He should pay attention to the responsibilities placed on his art; he should respect the technology of his work. He should not overvalue or be gullible. He should not be unfaithful, whether in praise or blame, especially in modern times, he should not be unfaithful in praise."

Murry's point is extremely thorough. For the sake of livelihood, great critics become cheap, disregard their own art or technique, and make unfaithful praise and blame - which we call "flattery" and "condemnation." Such people are still far from being critics. We need to rebuild criticism.

I also feel that one reason why China does not have good criticism is that there is not enough space given to criticism. Literary supplements rarely open a column for criticism, other supplements have restrictions, and magazines are out of the question now. In this environment, good criticism is naturally difficult to create. Criticism itself is an art, and it requires a certain amount of completeness.

If the above two conditions are met—no cheapness, no restrictions on space—how to achieve the five standards set by Murry? I dare to offer a method: the critic is an artist, then, like an artist, he must have cultivation and foundation. It's not easy to be a critic. Fleury said to Anatole France: "Sir, oratory, pure literature, philosophy, history, everything is here, criticism is not included, it includes everything. Yes, critics take turns as speakers, philosophers, historians." I hope that critics will not neglect their training for the sake of livelihood.

Critics, you are powerful, but don't devalue yourselves or be opportunistic.

### Hu Quan's Pro-War Argument

— Jie

——Random Notes on Reading History——

History is often an excellent lesson from reality. The mistakes made by the ancients are clearly shown in history to future generations, so that future generations can avoid repeating the same mistakes. This is like a ship that runs aground and sinks on a reef. This reef should have a sign to warn later ships.

In the Song Dynasty, which suffered from the Jin invasion, Emperors Huizong and Qinzong were taken away; areas north and south of the Yellow River fell one after another. Therefore, Emperor Gaozong of Song briefly crossed to Lin'an and established a small, safe, but incomplete court. At this time, the national crisis had indeed reached its extreme. However, at the time, there were virtuous ministers such as Li Gang and Zhao Ding internally, and famous generals such as Zhang Jun, Zong Ze, Yue Fei, and Han Shizhong externally; moreover, there were millions of righteous soldiers and heroes on both sides of the Yellow River who were under the command of Zong Ze and resisting the Jin. At this time, if Emperor Gaozong of Song had only made a determination to resist the war, it would not have been difficult to recover the lost territory—but unfortunately, Gaozong was昏庸 cowardly and weak, and lightly believed the false words of Wang Boyan, Huang Qianshan, Qin Hui, and other pro-peace faction members, and actually accepted humiliating conditions to negotiate peace with the Jin people. As a result, virtuous ministers were expelled, good generals were wronged, and the will of the millions of heroes on both sides of the Yellow River was frustrated, and they scattered and disintegrated.

While Qin Hui was in charge of peace negotiations, Hu Quan, a compiler in the Privy Council, strongly advocated resistance. In his memorial, he was passionate and somber, not only explaining the pros and cons of war and peace, but also boldly suggesting that the pro-peace faction be temporarily beheaded to show his determination never to humiliate and negotiate peace. In his eyes, the culprits of the pro-peace faction were Qin Hui, Sun Jin, and Wang Lun. He wrote in his memorial: "I wish to cut off the heads of the three men and impale them on poles in the Gaojie, then the envoy will stay, and we will blame them for their rudeness, and then ask for a teacher to punish them, so that the spirit of the three armies will double without fighting; otherwise, I would rather go to the East China Sea and die. How can I live in the small court?" After the memorial was presented, Qin Hui suspected that he had a mental illness, otherwise how could he have such bold and arrogant words? Qin Hui demoted him to Guangzhou. Wu Shigu of Yixing had Hu Quan's "Pro-War Argument Memorial" engraved on wood. The Jin people offered a thousand taels of gold to recruit it, which shows that the enemy also worshiped the upright and loyal officials of the Song Dynasty.

Later, when Emperor Xiaozong of Song ascended the throne, Hu Quan presented a second memorial, which again rejected peace negotiations and requested that troops be sent to resist the war. He analyzed the psychology of the pro-peace faction at the time in great detail. He believed that there were three types of people who advocated peace: one type was "stealing and cowardly," with no spirit of national revival, only knowing how to be greedy for life and afraid of death; the second type was "begging for peace," only knowing how to temporarily seek temporary comfort, not for the long-term plan of the country; the third type was "flattering," following the minister's suggestion that peace should be negotiated, in order to win the minister's favor. The country was ruined by these three types of people! It is strange that Hu Quan presented two memorials, but none of them were adopted. Emperor Gaozong of Song made a mistake in the past, and Emperor Xiaozong made another mistake in the future. As a result, the lost territory could not be recovered, and the Song Dynasty was in jeopardy!

Don't forget the past, the teacher of the future. The lessons of history, everyone should remember and never forget. We hope that everyone now should be Hu Quan who advocates resistance, and completely eliminate all pro-peace concepts of stealing and cowardice, begging for peace, and flattering. Whoever dares to openly advocate peace negotiations should "cut off his head and impale him on a pole in the Gaojie."

### Someone from a Certain Country

— Huang Ningying

This can only be blamed on the helmsman's carelessness—

Knowing that this is a treacherous voyage,

Surely to encounter a hurricane that capsizes the boat,

Ending innocent lives

In the starless night sea.

Even if he is a good swimmer,

It is also difficult to drift to the other shore.

He can't dry his wet, torn clothes,

He can't warm his body, he can't calm his breath.

(Who doesn't know that the low-pressure country can easily suffocate people?)

Even if he escapes, he must be emaciated.

Like a mountain bird in a cage;

He must also wither, like a green tree in a pot.

At that time, he hates himself again

He shouldn't have been a good swimmer.

However, who is to blame for this?

This can only be blamed on the helmsman's carelessness.

Scientific Essay

### Refining Tungsten

— Xin Jun

The world's tungsten producing country is China first. There are many mineral deposits in Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces. The national output accounts for 37 percent of the world's output. It is a major resource of our country. Tungsten is very similar to tin, so it is not easy to distinguish. It was not until 1781 that Scheele could distinguish it as a metal. Two years later, someone separated tungsten, and since then it has been used to make hard alloys. But it has never been used alone. In 1905, tungsten was mixed with paste and extruded from a mold to make the best filament for light bulbs. However, tungsten wire is very brittle, so it is very difficult to manufacture and inconvenient to use. Coolidge, a professor at General Electric of the United States, spent many years of hard work. He invented a method to make tungsten ductile (flexible). At first, general metallurgical experts thought it was impossible, because the usual way to make metal ductile is to heat the metal to above the tough point and then cool it to the normal temperature, so that the purpose can be achieved. However, using this method applied to tungsten can be said to be ineffective. Finally, the only method that can be refined and made tough has been found. This method is to crush the metal grains and beat them into grain strips. Soften them when they are cold, then heat them, not so high that they return to the tough point, and then hammer them very carefully. Reheat and hammer them after cooling, each time at a lower temperature than the previous time. Reheat and cool like this, continue hammering until the ordinary temperature is reached. If the same method is used for other metals, not only will they not become tough, but they will become brittle instead.

There is only this one method, but it must be done step by step according to the steps. When the metal grains are pulled out, the bar becomes tough. If you are a little careless, it will completely fail, and the tungsten will be pulverized at the slightest touch when it is cold.

Only after years of hard work and research can satisfactory results be achieved. The tungsten wire that has been made really has an extraordinary tensile strength: one thousandth of an inch thick can withstand a force of 600,000 pounds per square inch. This kind of tungsten wire is so soft that it can be wound into various patterns without breaking. As the saying goes: Refined steel turns into a soft finger, now it can really be said that refined tungsten turns into

The method of refining tungsten from tungsten ore is relatively simple. That is to extract tungsten trioxide, also known as tungstic acid, from scheelite, and then reduce it with carbon and tungsten trioxide to obtain impure powdered tungsten. This kind of powder is pressed into strips with large hydraulic force. It cannot be melted by heat, because the melting point of tungsten is 3370 degrees. This is higher than any other metal, white gold is only 1755 degrees. It takes a lot of procedures and is very complicated to make filaments from strips.

With tungsten wire, the efficiency of light bulbs has more than doubled, and the light emitted is brighter and whiter than any light used before. The efficiency of the phonograph needle made of tungsten steel has increased more than 50 times compared with the needles used before. Other things, like the target of X-ray tubes and the spark plug of cars, have been improved by using tungsten.

Tungsten has two names in Western languages: Wolfram and Tungsten.

### "Long Live Little Brother"

— Li Huiying

The Macheng River lay quietly across our path. We finally summoned the courage to wade across the river barefoot.

The river water was icy cold. When we dipped a foot in, the chill went straight through our soles and into our hearts. The water grew deeper, and Lao Kai found it a little hard going, but just then, the comrades started singing "Song of the Volga Boatmen."

"This quiet Macheng River isn't bad."

"The waters of the Volga River are full of the breath of freedom."

"This river doesn't freeze in winter. It can't compare to the Volga River."

"The Songhua River does freeze, doesn't it? One day, it will roar out a voice of protest from under the winter ice, bringing fresh air and freedom."

When we reached the opposite bank, we were indeed a little tired. Comrade Wang, being short, had his shorts wet half way up his thighs. "Juan's roar" blurted out a Sichuan curse, then laughed at himself and started wringing the wet water out of his pants.

"You probably can't find a fellow as short as you on the banks of the Volga River." Someone was teasing Comrade Wang.

The little brother didn't mind at all, but said with a chuckle, "I guess the people on the banks of the Volga River don't have noses as small as ours, do they?"

Everyone laughed. Shouting:

"Long live little brother!"

Ahead was a sandy beach. We had to cross the sand to get to the fields, and then we'd reach the main road into town. When one foot came out, the other would sink in. Fine sand stuck to everyone's feet. Looking back, the winding tracks looked like long ropes newly added to tie up boats.

"Faster!"

"Faster!" If we walked another three miles, we'd reach the important town of northeast Hubei—Macheng County.

### Manchuria's Snow

— Shu Qun

He must remember this task: alone, using a pistol to threaten a young woman from a good family, forcing her from her home to the secret room he has prepared for her; he has already investigated her thoroughly – her courtyard, her bedroom, her bed, even her whereabouts and where she goes at all times.

He must remember this task: to solve the hunger of thousands of comrades and guns, and at the same time, to determine several percentages of his motherland’s fate.

He is not a thief or a robber; he is just a student who studied the navy, a young man of twenty-one years old. He has neither participated in war, nor walked the edge of the battlefield: this kind of life-risking attempt is still new to him.

He wears a leather hat that tightly secures his jaw, leaving only his eyes and nose exposed outside the edge of the hat; on his feet, he wears a pair of felt boots that extend past his knees, with beautiful leather patterns inlaid on the edges and between each seam of the boots: in his hand, he holds a cane, with a kind of elasticity, which, when pushed forcefully against the wind, can produce a sound similar to that of metal. To unfamiliar eyes, he seems like a noble hunter who enjoys hunting as a hobby – someone who still loves his hunting attire while hunting; this kind of deception, using falsehood to conceal a troubled soul, is also a first for him.

However, he is not afraid; because what he relies on is a uniquely selfless belief. The courage generated by this belief is the most invincible.

Of course, he hopes for his own success. After success, in the snowy fields, between the flowing waters, comrades who have suffered for the motherland for years in the piercingly cold wind, can have one or two full meals – even if it is a thin sorghum porridge; at the same time, the gun barrels of their equally hungry guns can also be loaded with a few more bullets. After success, on both banks of the Songhua River's ice flow, in the middle of the snow-capped peaks rising from Changbai Mountain, there will be one or several glorious battles recorded in the motherland's history. After success, countless people will once again celebrate by setting off firecrackers towards the enemy: escaped birds can fly back, and fly back to their old nests. After success, when he returns, let countless hands of comrades cheer and embrace him, embrace and cheer:

'Defender of the Motherland!' Even

'The success of a hero!'

In the world, even if there are precious miracles, how can they compare to his glory and pride? At that time, his life will have received the greatest reward of life, he can die, die in a burst of laughter, and after death, have nothing to regret.

If he fails, he will calmly walk to the desolate execution ground, look at the people seeing him off with pitying faces in front and behind him, and return a sign of revenge, or words:

'Do not forget me, I die for the living – you are Chinese, you should avenge me!'

Or, towards the vast space, say one more sentence:

'Farewell, Motherland and comrades!'
