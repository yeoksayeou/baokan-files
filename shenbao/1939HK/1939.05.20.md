### The Anguish of Wartime Youth

Recently, I have frequently received letters from young people in various regions pouring out their anguish. From these letters, one can see the various contradictory phenomena occurring in the current stage of the War of Resistance as it enters a new period of hardship: for example, on the one hand, the government and other military, economic, and diplomatic institutions are experiencing a severe 'talent famine', while on the other hand, there are still thousands upon thousands of specialized talents and outstanding young cadres shouting from all directions, 'No way to serve the country'; on the one hand, war zones, occupied areas, and various regions in the rear urgently need young people from all over, especially overseas Chinese, to return to the country and their hometowns to serve, while on the other hand, many members of service groups are experiencing the tragic lament of 'difficult work, running into walls everywhere', and many young people are becoming pessimistic and disappointed about the future of the War of Resistance as a result. Yesterday, a young man who had returned to his hometown to serve sent a letter from the area of ××, in which he said: 'These hardworking and resilient young people are regarded as landmines in Eastern Europe, as if they will explode immediately if they are not cleared away. In this way, pointless friction occurs! Fortunately, the other party still understands the greater good and the matter was settled peacefully. But... this kind of friction is not limited to one place or one time, and there is a possibility of it continuing to develop. Therefore, I can't help but feel chilled to the bone, and I can't help but re-evaluate the future of the War of Resistance, and my own ideological problems have arisen... Therefore, I am eager to leave.' Another young man from a service group sent a letter from the area of ××, in which he said: 'There is no political ideal here, and no passion to fight for the nation and the country. A bunch of nondescript people have essentially become government offices, emphasizing hometown connections and personal relationships. What's the point of sacrificing my studies for this? I am determined to leave this atmosphere.' Generally speaking, this kind of anguish of young people during the War of Resistance is, of course, a problem worthy of attention. If it is not resolved thoroughly and appropriately as soon as possible, it will naturally have a significant adverse impact on the War of Resistance and national reconstruction.

All these contradictory phenomena, the anguish of young people, and even pessimism and disappointment, although they have various special reasons, can generally be summarized into the following points: First, the corruption of local political institutions; second, the ignorance and cowardice of a few authorities; third, the insidious poison of certain local feudal remnants; fourth, the rumors, slanders, provocations, and sowing of discord by traitors and wavering compromisers; fifth, the lack of political awareness of a few young people and errors in their service and work methods. We believe that the above five points are very serious symptoms. If these symptoms are not cured, the great cause of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction will inevitably be seriously hindered. However, at the same time, we must also recognize that these symptoms are absolutely not 'incurable diseases'. There are ways to cure them, and in fact, from the actual situation in various places since the War of Resistance, 'signs of improvement' have appeared sooner or later or more or less!

First of all, we must know that the Chinese nation is a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country. Since the September 18th Incident and up to the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident, we have encountered a modern capitalist imperialist country that has accumulated sixty years of planning to conquer us, mobilized its national strength, and launched a full-scale armed invasion. If we had not resisted at that time, then as the supreme leader has declared, China would have already been practically subjugated, and our people would have already practically become colonial slaves of Japanese fascism! But thanks to the wise and brilliant leadership of the supreme leader, and thanks to the close cooperation of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as all ethnic groups and social classes, we finally launched a full-scale War of Resistance. In the twenty-two months of heroic struggle, we have annihilated 800,000 to 900,000 Japanese soldiers and consumed a significant percentage of Japan's national wealth. In terms of the morale of the people of both countries in fighting, and in terms of the contrast in the international status of the two countries, on the one hand, China has gained widespread sympathy and assistance, and on the other hand, Japan is increasingly isolated and even reduced to a second-rate country! Our successes, both in their speed and greatness, are unprecedented in history! Even in terms of domestic politics, the fact that the government and the people are now standing on the same front, the fact that the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, as well as all ethnic groups and social classes, is now openly existing and gradually developing, the fact that achieving democracy, improving people's livelihoods, adhering to the War of Resistance, and building an independent, free, and happy new China, etc., have become the unanimous public opinion of the whole country and have been stipulated in the central government's program for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction and in the administrative programs of various provinces and cities - all these politically progressive phenomena today, how could they be compared to what was before the War of Resistance? What one dared to imagine? Of course, we do not think that the current contradictions and the painful phenomena that cause anguish to young people are not worth paying attention to, but we believe that from the perspective of the overall historical law and the curve of the development of the entire political situation, these painful phenomena are already a countercurrent or a residual influence. They absolutely have no power to reverse history, so all pessimism and disappointment are unfounded!

Secondly, the question is how to stop the development of these countercurrents or residual influences, and how to dredge and eliminate these countercurrents or residual influences? We believe that solving this problem is the common task of the entire nation in the current stage to overcome new difficulties, strive for greater victories, and lay the foundation for success. To undertake this task, first, we must rely on our concerted efforts to promote political reform towards a broader and more thorough direction in accordance with the Kuomintang's program for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction and the supreme leader's various declarations and announcements. The main thing is to consolidate and expand the unity of all parties and classes in the country and resolutely support the long-term War of Resistance. It is to seriously review and urge the faithful implementation of all resolutions and laws on improving politics since the War of Resistance. It is to strive for the realization of appropriate and necessary democratic politics and the improvement of people's lives. Second, it is necessary to enhance national self-esteem and self-confidence, and increase the spiritual strength to support the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. The main thing is to universally and effectively promote the National Spiritual Mobilization Program and implementation measures. It is necessary to intensify the resolute struggle against the conspiracies of traitors and wavering compromisers and the erroneous arguments of 'anti-communism', 'anti-Chiang', and 'peace', and fundamentally shatter Japan's poisonous scheme of a quick victory and quick peace, using Chinese to control Chinese and using Chinese to destroy Chinese. Third, it is necessary to make redoubled efforts to launch collective learning and cultivation movements, so that every one of our young people can develop the strength to persevere in fighting in dangerous and difficult situations and strive for final victory. Improve and mobilize all the methods of serving the people, wartime service and battlefield service.

Finally, we want to solemnly point out that all of this depends on the unity and struggle of our fighting and revolutionary youth! As long as we can unite and struggle, no countercurrents or residual influences can stop us from moving forward! Moreover, the entire international and domestic political situation is favorable to us! Young people are the main force of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, and young people are the masters of the ideal country of the future. We must never underestimate ourselves, and we must never shrink back from difficulties! The ancients said, 'If things were not difficult, what use would there be for us!' Buddha said, 'If I don't go to hell, who will go to hell!' The young people of China today should even more happily persevere in the arduous struggle for justice and freedom. We welcome greater countercurrents and residual influences, and we welcome greater darkness and danger, because after overcoming these, there will be light, freedom, and final victory!

### Launching the Youth and Student Movement with a Focus on Issues Vital to Young People

— Dou Guang

One of the greatest characteristics of the Chinese youth and student movement is that it has been closely linked to political activities from the very beginning. For example, the heroic and tragic 'May Fourth' and 'December Ninth' Movements launched epoch-making national movements with great historical significance against imperialism - especially against Japanese imperialism - and against feudalism. This demonstrates the progressiveness of Chinese youth and students. They have a high degree of national and political consciousness, and they grasp the political issues that are the key to solving all social problems. They know that only by achieving liberation and freedom in the nation and society can they have their own survival and happiness, and only by today's heroic struggle can they have a victorious and bright future.

In the great tide of today's national revolutionary war, many young intellectuals have already been swept up to participate in various aspects of the War of Resistance. They are bravely fighting in the front lines, the rear areas, and the areas behind enemy lines with a spirit of sacrificing everything. They have contributed a great deal to saving the nation and the country from danger. But let us look again at the general rear area that has a vast area. There are quite a few young people who are in a state of confusion. The youth and student movement is in a scattered and silent atmosphere. Even in places where it is active, it only represents a part of the progressive youth. This is still very far from the urgent situation of the War of Resistance today. Some people say that this is due to the weakness of the intellectuals themselves, a weakness of being afraid of difficulties, afraid of hardship, and easily changed. In fact, this is not a sufficient reason. The reason for this is that the problem is limited by the conditions left over from the historical environment, a political problem. Because even today, there are still some people, especially those who are responsible for leading the youth movement and education, who do not have a deep, thorough, correct, and concrete understanding of the national policy of Chairman Chiang's leadership in uniting to resist the war to the end and striving for final victory, the national defense education policy of the Program for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and the revolutionary spirit of the Three Principles of the People, or they are unwilling to understand it; they do not recognize or are unwilling to recognize that the nature of today's youth movement is anti-Japanese, national, and non-partisan; they have not experienced or are unwilling to experience the attitude that leading the youth movement should have a correct relationship between active leadership and respecting its independence. …These problems are precisely alerting us that the youth and student movement should be more closely linked to political issues and further develop this characteristic to fight. To make the majority of young people understand that only by more actively, more deeply, and more broadly participating in various aspects of the War of Resistance can they achieve the victorious resolution of issues vital to them.

Then, in order to develop this characteristic, in order to launch the youth and student movement, the shortcomings of neglecting the issues vital to young people should be overcome in the youth and student movement, and the overall task of the youth movement should be linked to the issues vital to young people. This is the central link of the youth and student movement today. What are the issues vital to young people?

The first is the issue of learning – Due to the lack of experience and knowledge of young people, in order to seek their own independence, in order to seek the liberation of the nation and society, and in order to achieve the lofty ideal of seeking progress and seeking light, they all have a high spirit of learning and go to all aspects to learn. Therefore, 'learning is one of the tasks of young people'. But today, many young people are showing morbidities of frustration, depression, and negativity in the issue of learning; especially for the young people living in schools: The curriculum in the school is still those old textbooks and teaching methods and learning methods that are irrelevant to the War of Resistance, and even opposite to it. They are learning all day long in order to cope with exams, and they have no free time to do extracurricular activities, to read newspapers, discuss various political issues, participate in national salvation work, and engage in sports. So that some progressives gradually leave the school, and some laggards are even more confused. Therefore, it is very necessary to resolve the demands of young people on this issue, provide opinions to the school authorities, ask the school to lead discussions on various issues, and enrich and reform certain topics in the curriculum.

Secondly, it is very important to solve the learning requirements of young people who have dropped out of school and hold various problem seminars, reading clubs, etc. Under the influence of the wartime environment, I do not know how many young people have dropped out of school.

The second is the problem of life – The characteristic of the lives of young students is a kind of joy, liveliness, and new sports and cultural entertainment, etc. They often organize various teams, singing teams, and troupes, etc. to compete and perform, and through and developing these characteristics, to achieve their desire for cultural life, especially to create various new forms of activities with the War of Resistance as the theme, such as practicing throwing hand grenades, climbing mountains, etc., which can not only restore fatigue after learning and working, can exercise a strong physique. And can increase participation in the skills of the War of Resistance. However, in order to enable this issue to unfold smoothly, the kind of development that was limited to artists and athletes in the past, and the kind of concept that was only for championshipism and sectarianism, should be destroyed: Only in this way can the relationship between each other become close, rather than hindering each other's unity: Only in this way can it become a development of mutual observation, rather than mutual jealousy and exclusion.

Secondly, the environment of the school, an environment that has basically organized them, and the youth also has a kind of gregarious psychology, a psychology that if you do it, I will do it too and hope that everyone will do it. It is very good to use and develop this environment and these psychologies to strengthen their organization and establish a democratic, tense, and disciplined collective life to cultivate correct and firm ideological consciousness, which has a guaranteed significance for consolidating the organization of the youth and student movement.

The third is the issue of career – Originally, it was supposed to be a social issue, but young students are just about to live independently, so it is also a vital issue that young people urgently need to solve, and they often hope and demand to solve the issue of their own career. In order to solve this urgent demand, organize organizations such as mutual introduction or mutual help of careers, in order to solve the problem of life: Especially in today's War of Resistance is in a new and severe stage, the country and the nation have a large number of human resources and intellectual resources to participate in various aspects of the War of Resistance: to the army, to the front, to the rear, to the national defense industry, to the transportation construction. …It is very necessary to have a large number of young people organized to serve the War of Resistance. For example, the current situation of the War of Resistance is to launch a wide range of guerrilla warfare in the rear, destroy puppet regimes, and increase the difficulty of the Japanese attack, so that it cannot turn the occupied debt area into a rear area for further advancement, which has a head-on significance. It is a work that is both suitable and willing to do to organize the young people who have fled from the occupied areas to the rear and advance to their hometowns to launch anti-Japanese work and guerrilla warfare, because they have a full of revengeful blood and are very familiar with geography and personnel. This is a practical and powerful work to launch the youth and student movement.

In order to be able to grasp the above several issues that are vital to young people well and enable the youth and student movement to unfold smoothly, then the following are the several main methods:

1. Unite progressive forces to unite all forces. To promote, activate, and develop the work, then it is of major significance to unite advanced elements and seek unity in action. However, it is not only necessary to unite the progressive elements in the youth and students, but also to unite all sympathizers in society and schools, people who strive for progress, and give them active help and leadership, and at the same time, the struggle for the laggards cannot be relaxed. In order to achieve this goal, first of all, there should be a broad mind and a spirit of mutual understanding, not for the dispute of some unprincipled small problems; all problems should be based on the overall situation and work benefits, rather than standing in extreme opposition to each other. Secondly, there should be a humble attitude, respect for other people's opinions, and always solicit other people's opinions, help them express their opinions, and discuss with each other. If there are mistakes, use the spirit of persuasion to correct each other; the conceited idea that only one's own is good and others are not good, and the idea of ​​heroism that oneself is great, should be overcome and destroyed.

2. Go deep among the masses. In order for the vast masses of young people to be mobilized and organized to participate in various aspects of the War of Resistance today, it is very necessary to understand their environment and understand their vital demands; then it is necessary to go deep into their lives. You should take advantage of various opportunities to approach them anytime and anywhere, approach them through the relationships of various relatives, friends, groups, and events, and approach them by using each person's personality and interests; you should not set the conditions for making friends with people too high, have too advanced of ideas, or only limit them to certain narrow areas. For example, only approach him if he is good to you, and do not approach him if he is bad to you; only see his shortcomings and not see his strengths, and then conclude that he is not good, do not approach him, and despise him. This unprincipled attitude is a sin against work. Secondly, in order to gain people's faith, you should also try your best to help them solve various difficult problems. If you can unite the masses more through these works, the easier it will be to achieve victory.

3. Improve people and improve yourself: To get into the community, it is not to mix with them in a vulgar way, but to be able to mobilize the community, then you should improve them, educate and exercise them, so that they have a correct and progressive outlook on life and the world, so that they recognize the current situation of the War of Resistance and their own tasks, and can actively participate in the War of Resistance camp; at the same time, you should also always be a learning model in the work and in the community, so that you can constantly improve and constantly improve in theory to meet the task of bearing this arduous national revolution.

Finally, we should firmly believe that the power of the War of Resistance, the iron current of the times, and the dawn of light are pushing everything forward. Some obstacles that block the progress of history will definitely be overcome and eliminated; do not be negative and distressed when you encounter difficult obstacles, but should have a fighting spirit of foresight of difficulties, recognition of difficulties, and crushing difficulties.

### The Spaniards in Suffering

— Original by Special Correspondent of the French Humanitarian Newspaper, Translated by Zhao Mei

February 6th, From Ceidife — At three in the morning, Comrade Chuanlie and I ran up the highway leading to Bou. Shize, which was bombed yesterday, was silent at the foot of the mountain. On the mountain, a heavy roar echoed down.

During the day, trucks kept driving up the mountain, sometimes filling the road, blocking a large group of people. At night, the trucks all stopped, lining up on the highway.

Countless Spanish soldiers arrived at the border, and the few members of the International Brigade who had been delayed along the way also arrived. Everyone gathered on the hillside. In the transparent night, rows of stretched bodies could be seen everywhere, tightly wrapped in blankets. In the distance, a long line of freight cars waited on the highway, continuous black shadows, endless.

In the close gaps between the vehicles, a constant stream of refugees passed. Men carried bags or briefcases; women, made wild by fatigue, moved forward with heavy steps. Some used cloth strips to tie babies to their chests because if their legs were still supporting them, their arms hung down broken. Powerless. Huge trucks, fifty, fifty, drove towards France. But the wait for the cars was too long. From two o'clock yesterday until now, not a single car had come to Shize. The waiting drove people crazy, and the firelight in the darkness would make people scream hysterically: what if an air raid comes?

That was the first terrible thing. As dawn gradually broke, revealing the calm waves of the Mediterranean Sea covered with pine, the horror of the people increased. In each car, piles of felt, luggage, and motionless people were lying. The morning was freezing cold, and the tarpaulins covering the cars were also covered with a layer of white frost.

Before the sky was fully bright, a whistle sounding the start of the march reverberated through the valley, and then, in the gray mountainside, countless warriors and refugees of the Spanish Democratic Republic stood up. The lying black shadows came to life and began to descend the mountain towards France. (G.Beaukais)

February 6th, From Paiduisifa — The retreat was carried out in the dark night, and heavy trucks drove past the maple trees on the road. All that could be heard was the sound of sandals rubbing against the ground, miserable moans, and slow sobs.

At the exit of the Paiduis Bridge, an infantryman was stationed. Several harsh lights ruthlessly illuminated the worried faces of the old men and women, and the painful expressions on the small faces of the children. Everyone lined up in a single line, divided into small groups, waiting to enter. The French soldiers next to them looked with pity at this heartbreaking line waiting in the dark.

Here, I found our comrades Barel, Grisa, Ang, and several members of the council, who were going to spend the night here and serve the refugees as they advanced.

A damp cold struck people's shoulders and backs. On the mountainside, the refugees waiting to enter became impatient and lit a bonfire to keep warm. Everyone sat around the fire. The red flames swallowed the darkness, illuminating the forest and the restless people. This was a rare night in the valley.

As soon as it dawned, the guards opened a path for the refugees to pass. The wounded, with their heads and limbs wrapped in dirty cloths, limped forward: their faces were like those who had been tortured, their eyes like those with a fever. Because the wounds were new, and due to the lack of sanitation equipment, they were not properly bandaged. Everyone had to be searched: on the side of the road, a young military doctor had to ask everyone to untie the bandages for inspection, which was very inconvenient for the wounded. Afterwards, everyone gathered at a designated location nearby, and the numbers quickly filled up. But there was no cover above, no bed below, no medicine, and no life-saving medicine. The comrades of the International Central Sanitation Department worked very hard because the government did not give them any help. Even the field hospital was not formed. It was not just insufficient, but as one military doctor said angrily: 'Intentional pretense!'

Those with lighter injuries supported the severely injured with broken arms and legs, a female refugee led a blind person, and a young man with a bandaged leg lay on the back of a mule, constantly moaning.

Due to the rapid driving of the drivers, although the number of cars was small, they quickly carried all the women, children, and wounded to Bulu (Boutou). But after the first batch left, another batch followed closely, tired and aching, holding children, always a heartbreaking line. A guard officer told me in an agitated tone about the tragic situation of the four children. The rebel planes only dropped bombs on civilians. Therefore, after each air raid, almost half of the arriving refugees were injured. The scene was unbearable to witness.

The soldiers treated the refugees very well. One officer took his own quilt and covered a mother and her baby, and then he hugged another frozen baby all the way to the car.

On the other hand, the wounded who were so injured that they could not move lay on the ground, damp with mist, in front of the bridge, gritting their teeth, waiting to be transferred to the field hospital. The severely wounded watched their wounds close and reopen, and became infected with poison, and their lives were leaving them every minute.

Could the French government not have taken all necessary measures earlier to help its sister country's people? Their fate is mostly due to the French government's foreign policy! We demand that the French Ministry of Defense immediately provide all sanitary equipment to help the refugees, not only morally should this be the case, but also in response to their fighting for so long to defend our borders.

(Emlle Dectolt)

February 28th, From Shibai — All night long, the light people continued to arrive, gradually decreasing until dawn.

Without any delays along the way, we arrived at this iron (Cerhl). The small station was converted into a field hospital, where four thousand wounded and sick people gathered. Several ambulances were parked on the tracks, loaded with medicines and supplies ready to treat this large group of patients on mud-covered straw.

These ambulances are Spanish. They waited here for eight days, waiting for the French government's order to allow them to cross the border. Unable to cross the border, they could not help the patients. Now only doctors and nurses from the Central Sanitary Department (Centrale Sanitaire) were treating the patients and the wounded under extremely poor conditions.

If they had been allowed to enter French territory earlier—that is, eight days ago—perhaps many people would have been saved. But there was something even worse: until now, no medical supplies had been sent from the French side. All that was being used came from Spain.

All the work was done by the heroic people of the Central Sanitation Department. In addition to constantly attending to patients, they also had to clean the toilets themselves! They were the ones who helped! Food and food distribution. Sometimes, because there were too many wounded and too few service providers, food distribution did not stop until three in the morning. They did all the work, but on the other hand, the station authorities maliciously hindered their work. We have already said that some people are deducting food. At noon, the refugees only get a large spoonful of lentils, or peas, a sausage, a little milk cake, and two small pieces of bread. In the afternoon, it was even smaller, and often cold. We know that the French government pays 7.50 francs per day to each refugee. If the person in charge of food is honest, each person should have a ton of rich food.

Therefore, we can understand why many wounded people cannot withstand the first surgery: the lack of food makes them unable to withstand the surgery.

In view of this, the comrades of the Central Sanitation Department once asked the authorities to allow them to prepare food. In fact, the food donated by the people of various places in France could be used to prepare good food for the refugees, but the answer given by the authorities was a flat refusal. The Central Sanitation Department then requested permission to run army-style mobile kitchens, and the answer was another refusal. They requested the installation of running water pipes, refused, requested the installation of heaters, still refused!

There are a few more things to say.

Last night, a wounded mother slept outdoors in the open air, holding her baby tightly in her arms. Near dawn, it was very cold. The mother woke up and found that the baby in her arms had frozen to death.

An ambulance carrying several severely wounded soldiers went to various hospitals in (Perpiguan), but none were willing to accept them, so they had to be brought back to Shibai, but two of them could not bear it, and died from the violent movement of the car back and forth.

There was no place to put even the corpses. This morning I saw two corpses lying on the railway tracks, lying on stretchers, soaked in sewage, close to the place where the wounded soldiers came out to breathe fresh air. The corpses of heroes. It is such a crime to put them in sewage!

There is one more thing, and that is that in Beibi Kang (Perpigiuan), someone is recruiting soldiers for Franco. There, refugees and wounded soldiers are inspected as soon as they enter the country. As soon as they enter the room, someone immediately asks you: 'Are you willing to go back to Franco?' Then, without saying anything else, they will give you a letter of voluntary service stating that you are willing to return to the rebel area!

Using this forced method, in one day, among the five thousand refugees, they even managed to drive eight hundred people who were willing (?) to return to the rebel side.

Those who are willing to return to the government army side have a yellow card, and those who are willing to go to the rebel side have a green card. I only saw one woman with four children, all holding yellow cards in their hands. I asked what this meant? She added: 'This, this is going to Nagrin!' At the same time, a trace of a smile appeared on her tired face.

Some refugees declared that they would rather commit suicide than go to Franco's side: 'Go there, to be slaves? To suffer to death?'

At the same time, news from Kangdai (Hendaye) said that a train carrying Spanish soldiers back to Bopengge drove into the tunnel near Bayonne (Mousserolle). Because the speed was slow, fifteen soldiers jumped off the train. Isn't this enough to show the true intentions of the Spanish people? (Geonges Beauhofs)

### Soviet Attitude towards British Negotiations

— Zhen

(Special Translation) The Soviet News reported in an editorial on May 12, "The events of the past few weeks have fundamentally changed the European situation. By this, we mean first of all Hitler's speech in the German Parliament, and secondly the conclusion of the Italo-German military and political alliance. Western European political leaders mostly claim that these two events have not changed the situation in Europe. In fact, this is not the case. Not only that, but the purpose of this kind of rhetoric is to deceive public opinion. In fact, these two events have indeed made the entire political situation worse. First of all, as a result of Hitler's declaration in the Parliament, two important agreements have been eliminated. The original Anglo-German naval agreement has been cancelled since Hitler's declaration. At the same time, the German-Polish non-aggression pact also ceased to exist due to Hitler's declaration. How can the sudden cancellation of these two important treaties be said not to have caused changes in the international situation? As for the establishment of the German-Italian political and military alliance, it has also dealt a heavy blow to the situation before the incident. Some countries had hoped and tried to break up the Italo-German relationship and isolate Germany. This kind of hope and attempt is now completely hopeless. The Soviet people have repeatedly stated that the Anti-Comintern Pact jointly established by Germany, Italy and Japan is actually a mask to cover up the aggressive group of countries against Britain and France. In the past, many people did not believe it or even criticized it, but now the facts fully prove it. Such an environment has prompted democratic countries to intensify their efforts to try to form a united front for peace to resist the developing aggression. For example, the British and Soviet negotiations. Regarding this negotiation, politicians and the press of various countries have repeatedly spread malicious rumors about the Soviet Union's attitude, falsely claiming that the Soviet Union requires that even if it does not immediately take confrontational actions against aggressor countries, it should conclude a direct military alliance with Britain and France. This kind of statement, which has absolutely nothing in common with the Soviet Union's attitude, is not worth deceiving. The Soviet Union's past and future claims are that if Britain and France really want to build a bulwark against aggression in Europe, they must establish a mutual assistance united front. This front should mainly include Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland, or at least Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. We must point out that this frank and fundamentally defensive and peaceful Soviet attitude, which is based on mutual principles and equal obligations, has not been responded to sympathetically by Britain and France. As everyone knows, Britain, with the consent of France, has put forward a counter-proposal, in which Britain avoids discussing the issue of the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance treaty, and believes that the Soviet Union should immediately provide assistance when Britain and France are involved in hostile actions due to the implementation of guarantees for Poland and Romania. As for the assistance that should be obtained from Britain and France in accordance with the five-phase principle when the Soviet Union is involved in hostile actions due to fulfilling its guarantee obligations to any Eastern European country or will give it, it is never mentioned. In this way, although the Soviet Union undertakes exactly the same obligations as Britain and France, its position is not equal. At the same time, a very significant fact is that under this kind of arrangement, the right to decide whether to actually resist aggression and when to start resistance is entirely in the hands of Britain and France. Although the heavy responsibility of resistance, due to geographical relations, should mainly be borne by the Soviet Union. Some people say that Britain and France's defense of Poland and Romania is actually equal to defending the western border of the Soviet Union. This statement is absolutely not true. First, the western border of the Soviet Union is not limited to the Baltic countries. Secondly, and more importantly, Britain and France's defense of the Baltic countries is actually defending their own country, not the western border of the Soviet Union. Because they have a five-party assistance treaty with Poland, Poland must turn around and defend Britain and France against aggression. As for Romania, because it has a treaty of alliance with Poland, it must follow Poland, so Romania is actually an indirect ally of Britain and France. The position of the Soviet Union is completely different. It has no mutual assistance treaty with Britain, France, and Poland, but now it should agree to assist the above three countries without receiving any assistance from the three countries, and when the Soviet Union is directly invaded, it can only rely on itself. In this way, the Soviet Union is obviously in an unequal position.

### Unprecedented Tension in Shanghai: Strict Security Measures in the Concessions; Rumors Abound of a Japanese Armed Seizure of the International Settlement; The Municipal Council Made Necessary Contingency Arrangements Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 19th] Shanghai dispatch: Since the news of the Japanese troops landing on Gulangyu was released, the Shanghai Concession authorities have been on high alert due to constant pressure from the Japanese, preparing for any eventuality. A senior police officer expressed that the Japanese army might enter the concessions at any time, causing widespread panic, which was not alleviated by the strong stance of the U.S. and Britain. From early morning on the 19th, additional defenses were set up between the International Settlement and the French Concession, restoring the tense atmosphere of July 7th last year. Except for the main roads that remained open to vehicles and pedestrians, the rest of the area between the two concessions was blocked by barbed wire and sandbags. The French Concession also dispatched a large number of Vietnamese police and French police to conduct house-to-house searches in residential areas, aiming to find firearms and contraband. However, no incidents had occurred as of noon. It was rumored that on the afternoon of the 18th, Japanese troops in Hongkou suddenly mobilized, imposing special martial law and setting up sentries in the Yangshupu area, before withdrawing at 7 pm. The sudden heightened security in the concessions might be related to this.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Shanghai foreign dispatch: All French Concession police officers, members of the merchant corps, and French naval and land forces were secretly mobilized last night, and starting at 6 am this morning, they began conducting an unprecedented large-scale operation in the French Concession. This morning, obstacles have been placed at street corners within the concession, as well as at the boundaries between the French Concession and the International Settlement. Roads from the French Concession to the International Settlement, except for the most important ones, have been completely closed to traffic. Police officers and merchant corps members are searching pedestrians at various entry points, in small teams of up to four people, conducting spot checks. Chinese residences are being searched. It is reported that the purpose of this morning's operation is to apprehend political elements within the concession. The plan was extremely secretive, with police officers and French military officers only receiving orders from the authorities at 8 pm last night, and informing their subordinates to mobilize only this morning. Members of the French Merchant Corps were notified individually by special envoys sent by the authorities to their residences between 9 pm and 12 am last night. As for the members of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps in the International Settlement, they were only notified by telephone by the authorities at 5 am this morning to report for duty. This plan was so carefully executed that terrorist elements were unable to learn of the authorities' actions and escape into the International Settlement or other places beforehand. As of now, no unexpected incidents have occurred, and no one has been arrested. This morning, all newspapers published brief news about the mobilization of the merchant corps, but no one knew the reason. Some said that the mobilization of the merchant corps was a show of force to Japan, which is further evidence of the authorities' meticulous planning.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 11th] This morning, cargo trucks were speeding through the streets, while Chinese workers from the Municipal Council's Public Works Department were dividing up and installing barbed wire on various streets, cutting off traffic. Although the Municipal Council had notified newspaper offices not to publicize the matter, last night various newspapers had already briefly reported on the rumors that the Japanese army would forcibly seize the International Settlement. Municipal Council police officers were ordered to patrol yesterday, and today a large number of British and American naval forces were also dispatched to conduct large-scale searches of Chinese residences and hotels, particularly in areas believed to be hiding anti-Japanese elements. British and American naval forces are assisting the police in the British and American defense zones, respectively, but the search work is still being carried out by the police. At the same time, the Shanghai People's Volunteer Corps has also been ordered to be ready to be mobilized at any time. Today's Shanghai has completely entered a state of wartime. All that can be seen in the city are soldiers, guns, and barbed wire. The purpose of the Municipal Council's actions is generally believed to be to prevent the Japanese from having an excuse, to show that the Municipal Council is working hard to curb anti-Japanese activities in the concession, and to show that the Municipal Council has taken strong measures to stop the activities of lawless elements in order to avoid disputes. Therefore, this may be a warning to certain "terrorist elements" who specialize in creating incidents, preventing them from causing further trouble. The police department refused to comment on this view. At the same time, they did not deny the other rumor that the Municipal Council's purpose was to cut off the communication between the western district gambling dens and opium dens and the concession. Some observers believe that the Municipal Council's actions, after continuing to reject Japanese demands, are a sign to the Japanese that the concession authorities can handle any situation and do not need the Japanese to help.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 19th] Last night, all military police and volunteer corps in the Shanghai International Settlement and French Concession were secretly preparing. At around 6 am this morning, searches began in the French Concession on an unprecedented scale. From midnight, three-quarters of the intersections in the French Concession were suddenly closed. At the border between the International Settlement and the French Concession, the International Volunteer Corps set up barbed wire to guard the area. Anyone entering the International Settlement from the French Concession was subjected to searches by military police and volunteer corps members. Military police patrolled the French Concession, questioning pedestrians on the street and searching Chinese residences, with the intention of clearing out political activities and terrorist elements. The French Concession authorities' actions were extremely secretive, and it was expected that these elements would not be able to escape. No incidents have been reported so far, and no arrests have been announced.

### Sharp Fall in the Japanese Yen: Breaks Record Since the Start of the War

[Reuters, Shanghai, 19th] The Japanese yen fell sharply today, to an unprecedented level since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, worth only 96% of the national currency, due to a lack of demand.

### Britain Resolutely Rejects Unreasonable Demands from Japan; Japan Believes the Response from Various Countries is Insufficient and Decides to Put More Pressure on the Shanghai Municipal Council

[Tokyo, 19th] According to Japanese sources, after the United States notified Japan on the 17th that it rejected Japan's request to revise the administrative rights of the Shanghai International Settlement, British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie also delivered the British response to the Japanese Foreign Ministry at 11 am today. The response completely rejected Japan's demands, including increasing Japanese representatives in the Municipal Council, revising the Land Regulations, and reorganizing the Special District Court. A Foreign Ministry spokesperson declared this morning that such observations from various countries would not affect Japan's established policies. Japan has repeatedly requested that various countries allow revisions to the Shanghai International Settlement situation, entirely for the important task of "establishing a new order in East Asia." The spokesperson also stated that Japan did not expect a response from various countries, and would continue negotiations with the Shanghai Municipal Council.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] A Foreign Ministry spokesperson declared today that no foreign country can change Japan's fixed policy on foreign concessions in China, but the Japanese government is still willing to hold friendly talks with relevant countries to resolve this issue.

### A Glorious Page of War History in Ronghe, Southern Shanxi: Our Suicide Squad Attacks Japanese Special Service Agency

[Central News Agency, Xingji Dispatch] The Taiyuan Special Service Agency was promoted to the Shanxi Provincial Special Service Agency this spring. Colonel Inoue succeeded Tani Oginohana Yu as the head of the agency, expanding the organization and spreading its henchmen to various occupied counties. The Yuncheng Special Service Agency established a branch office at Miaoqian Ferry, 45 li west of Ronghe County, as an important agency for directing and plotting conspiracies in southwestern Shanxi. At the same time, Nakamura Isamu was specially appointed as the instructor of the puppet Ronghe Imperial Collaboration Army and the advisor to the 2nd Detachment of the Puppet Imperial Collaboration Bandit Suppression Army, obviously an important element of the Japanese and puppets in southern Shanxi. The Yuncheng Special Service Agency's Miaoqian Ferry branch office was located in the home of Chen Zizhang, a civilian. There were originally six staff members, and recently four more have been sent from Yuncheng to strengthen the work in southern Shanxi. Japanese Captain Sakamoto led a unit of about 60 men, with four light and heavy machine guns, stationed inside the Fengzha Miaoqian Fort to cover the branch office. The garrison point was only 300 meters away from the branch office. Many of the veterans in the Ronghe puppet Imperial Collaboration Army were loyal and patriotic individuals, who often felt "their hearts were in Han while their bodies were in the barbarian land." They were often mistreated by Nakamura and hated him to the bone. Since March, Shang Lao's units, including Cai Qingsan and Wang Fuqun, have successively led their troops to revolt. Cai Qingsan's more than 500 men, with complete equipment, were the most powerful, which was a major blow to the Japanese and puppet forces in southern Shanxi. After Cai and others revolted, they were reorganized into the 1st Detachment of the Security Forces, and first thoroughly destroyed the highway and power lines between Wanquan and Yangzhu, about 40 li. Then they fought with the Japanese and achieved many victories. Nakamura Isamu deeply hated Cai and others for this, and detained all of Cai's family members, involving more than 40 people, and imprisoned them in the special service agency. On the morning of April 28, Cai was ordered to attack the Miaoqian Special Service Agency and was very excited. He then discussed the steps to complete the mission with his subordinates. Battalion Commander Jiang Ziyun said, "How can we get the tiger cubs without entering the tiger's den?" After he spoke, eleven team members volunteered to dedicate their lives. At the same time, four policemen from the Ronghe Public Security Bureau volunteered to participate. He then led 16 strong men, each with a pistol, and departed from Tong'ai, which belonged to Wanquan, at 2 pm on the fourth day of the month. At 8 pm, they arrived at Zhonglizhuang and asked familiar villagers to borrow kitchen knives. The villagers, knowing that they were going to attack the Japanese, immediately gathered 17 kitchen knives and said to Jiang and others, "We hope to kill the Japanese as easily as cutting vegetables." Taking advantage of the night, they continued to advance. At around 9 pm, they arrived at the Miaoqian Ferry and sneaked to the special service agency. They knocked on the ring, and soon Zhang Zihe, a Chinese traitor, opened the door. Jiang and others rushed in and immediately put a knife to Zhang's neck, forbidding him to make a sound. After asking about Nakamura Isamu's residence, they raised their knives and struck. This Japanese running dog was already decapitated. The group went straight to Nakamura's room. He happened to be lying down, and seeing the situation, he knew it was urgent and drew his gun to resist. He was quickly embraced by our brave soldiers, and they chopped him with kitchen knives. At the same time, they split up to search each room. The eleven members of the Japanese agency, panicked and scurrying, tried to escape through the door, but were all bravely hacked to death by our men, lying in pools of blood. These eleven heinous traitors were not spared. It is said that many of the Japanese special service personnel were familiar with our situation and well-trained. Killing these eleven men was like killing nearly a hundred Japanese. This matter took only ten minutes from start to finish. The forty family members of Cai Qingsan and others were also all rescued by us. We seized one pistol, one lightweight wireless radio, one letter of appointment for Nakamura Isamu, and more than ten other documents. The Japanese soldiers protecting the area heard the news and opened fire. Our strong men had already quietly left. On the morning of the 25th, the Japanese and puppet troops from Wanquan, Lingao, Ronghe, and other areas gathered nearly a thousand men and advanced towards the Zhicun Miao area of Wanquan County, as if facing a formidable enemy. When they arrived, the rooms were empty and the fields were cleared. We had not a single soldier. The Japanese attacked and found nothing, and retreated in despair. After reporting the incident, a certain commander praised the bravery and heroic sacrifice of the strong men who risked attacking the Japanese, and issued an order to commend them.

### Cooperation Between Britain, America, and France in the Far East: Well Received by All Parties, Considered the Only Good Policy at Present

[Central News Agency, Paris, 18th] After the naval and marine corps of Britain, France, and the United States landed on Gulangyu at the same time, government insiders here commented that the three major democracies have a linked relationship and have decided to jointly protect their interests in the Far East. Diplomatic protests alone can be said to be ineffective. If Japan joins the military alliance treaty and is encouraged by Germany and Italy to pursue anti-French and anti-British policies, then Britain, France, and the United States should jointly take defensive measures to deal with them. The United Kingdom recently convened the Pacific Conference in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, to discuss the protection of various territories in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The defense plan agreed upon advocated cooperation between Britain and France to mutually protect all territories. The British government has notified France of the results of the meeting, and the United States has also joined this defense organization in practice.

### Influential British Newspaper Bitterly Complains that Weakness is Not a Solution, Deeply Delighted and Fortunate for America's Strong Attitude

[Reuters, London, 19th] The "Manchester Guardian" recently published an article commenting on the Gulangyu incident, saying that this incident was clearly deliberately created by the Japanese to test the reaction of Western powers in order to prepare for a larger operation in Shanghai. The report also said that "the most exciting fact is the attitude of the United States government, which first protested and first dispatched sailors to land, and took cooperative action with all parties in Britain without shirking responsibility. This is enough to awaken the mentally confused government of our country, which, although it has repeatedly failed in Europe, still hopes to maintain its appeasement policy in the Far East. However, the only result of the appeasement policy is to provoke strong anti-British movements in Japan and the Japanese-occupied areas in China, because aggression must attack the opponent's weaknesses. Since the United States is prepared to cooperate with Britain to protect their common interests in Gulangyu, then the United States will also be prepared to cooperate with Britain to protect their common interests in Shanghai and other places when necessary. Some believe that once Britain forms an alliance with the Soviet Union, it may cause negative reactions in Japan's policy. This kind of fear can be comforted by the United States' willingness to cooperate."

### Japanese Forced Slaughter in Shanghai Concessions; Bombs Discovered at Slaughterhouse; Anti-Puppet Disputes Still Unresolved

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Shanghai dispatch: The Shanghai pig trade and fresh meat industry have announced a shutdown for several days due to their unwillingness to be controlled by the puppet regime.

### Kerr Leaves Chongqing for Hong Kong and Shanghai

[Reuters, Chongqing, 19th] British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, accompanied by his private secretary, left here at 10 am this morning, flying to Kunming.

### Three-Nation Naval Landings in Gulangyu Shock Japan; Asahi Shimbun Worries About Over-Expansion; Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Makes Twisted Explanation and Ridicules

[Haitong News, Tokyo, 19th] Japanese people in all walks of life were shocked to hear that the United Kingdom, France, and the United States jointly dispatched troops to land in Gulangyu. Last night, newspapers here all criticized the move, saying that it had anti-Japanese implications. However, Japan does not want to expand the incident, and the Asahi Shimbun said that there is a risk of the matter expanding, but the newspaper did not mention the outcome.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 19th] A Foreign Ministry spokesperson declared today that no foreigners in Gulangyu were injured by the Japanese naval and marine corps that landed. However, foreign newspapers carried contrary news. It is regrettable that Britain, the United States, and France have taken joint action, concentrated warships, and dispatched sailors to land, because the reason for these countries to take this action is that the Japanese naval and marine corps searched foreigners in Gulangyu. But in fact, the Japanese did not do this, and no foreigners were injured by the Japanese military. Last year, the Japanese army patrolled Gulangyu for two months, and foreign warships did not dispatch troops to land, nor did the Japanese receive any notes or protests from any foreign country.

### National Production Conference Declaration (3)

Mining Industry

To further develop production, let's discuss the mining industry. Developing the mining industry to enhance rear area production and enrich national finances is a crucial task at present. The mineral resources of the southwest and northwest provinces related to national defense, military needs, or civil industries include coal, iron, oil, copper, and zinc in provinces such as Sichuan, Kang (Xikang), Shaanxi, Gansu, Zhejiang, Yunnan, and Guizhou. Those related to international trade or foreign exchange include gold, tin, tungsten, antimony, and mercury in provinces such as Kang (Xikang), Qinghai, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi. Their distribution is wide, and their reserves are abundant. Furthermore, new mines are constantly being discovered, demanding full development. In the future, the unexploited mineral resources in the southwest and northwest provinces should be actively explored, and the best ones should be selected for mining and smelting. For existing mines and smelters, regardless of whether they use modern or traditional methods, efforts should be intensified to promote guidance, maintenance, adjustment, expansion, and improvement to achieve the greatest possible effect with available funds in the near future. Regarding the expenses for exploring new mines or expanding, improving, and relocating smelters, if there are insufficient funds, the government should allocate funds to assist, so that both state-owned and private mines can develop simultaneously, ensuring that the resources for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction will not be depleted. For state-owned mines, emphasis should be placed on cooperation between the central and provincial governments. This is the first point.

Sales and Transportation Methods

Regarding the sales and transportation of mineral products, they can be classified based on type as either for export or for domestic consumption. For mineral products that maintain foreign exchange and develop international trade, constructing or improving international railways to facilitate exports is crucial. For mineral products that supply domestic industry and military needs, branch lines of domestic railways should be connected to major mining areas in advance to increase transportation capacity and reduce transportation costs, time, and effort, so that the production and smelting of various important mineral products can gradually meet the corresponding supply and demand. As for mineral products that should be under state control, the central government should manage them in a unified manner. Any special control measures originally established by the provinces should be abolished to achieve consistency. This is the second point.

Talent Cultivation

Regarding the cultivation of mining industry talent, domestic university mining and metallurgy departments should emphasize both theory and practice. In addition to mining and metallurgy, students should be assigned to major mines and smelters for practical training. For mineral processing, equipment should be increased to allow students to practice at any time to prepare for application, so that various mixed ore minerals can be fully distinguished, utilized, and increase efficiency. In addition, special attention should be paid to the training of mine foremen and workers. This is the third point.

Administrative Laws and Regulations

Regarding iron industry administration, based on the current situation of the domestic mining industry, it is gradually becoming more consistent than before. However, the responsible government agencies in various provinces should strive for unification and simplification, and urge the increase in mineral production. It is not only necessary to increase surveying teams to facilitate the people's access to mining rights, but also to strictly enforce mining laws. For mines that have already obtained permits but have not yet started construction or have suspended work, strict measures should be taken to avoid the virtual occupation of mining areas and hindering production. For mines where people have applied for mining rights but have not yet been surveyed, they should be urged to conduct surveys within a limited time and transfer the permits to facilitate merchants and benefit production. In addition to the temporary measures for limited application and management of coal and gold mines that the government has already promulgated, the expansions that were previously approved for mining by the responsible government agencies in various provinces should all be presented for replacement with permits, in order to consolidate mining rights. Old soil mines that are privately mined should be ordered to establish rights in accordance with the law within a limited time to avoid affecting the entire mining industry. This is the fourth point. The above four points are all matters that the central and local governments should urgently undertake for mining production, and should be implemented earnestly to benefit the mining administration. The development and construction of agriculture, forestry, industry, and mining have been outlined, but without complete and inexpensive transportation, even if production increases, sales will be hindered, which will not only fail to supplement military supplies but may also lead to blockage and collapse. Production relies on transportation to facilitate flow, and then supply and demand can be adjusted, and trade can prosper, leading to development and prosperity. Moreover, during the War of Resistance, the basic resources needed for national defense and the large quantities of products exported rely on transportation as their lifeline. The southwest and northwest regions are vast, with continuous mountains, and relying solely on highway transportation is not only too slow to be effective but also too wasteful. The newly built international transportation railways cannot be completed in a short period of time. If no other remedies are taken, the future will become increasingly difficult. Today, those who discuss economic construction in the southwest place too much emphasis on alleviating the current commercial suffering and neglect the study of transportation, resulting in the problem of mismatch between supply and demand. The current plan must be to adjust all transportation materials and统筹(coordinate) them, and adjust the quantity of various materials, transportation capacity, the amount of labor and materials, and the presence or absence of motive power before pushing the entire work of产运销存(production, transportation, sales, and storage). We believe that today's transportation construction, in addition to the international transportation lines in the southwest and northwest, should be considered. The key to saving time is: first, the construction of light railways. Although standard railways have their advantages, they are too expensive and take too long, which is not as fast as the completion of light railways. They are cheap and easy to popularize, so it is recommended that the government promptly prepare for the construction of light railways, which should be listed as the main body of land transportation tools; The second is the sorting out of the existing highways, such as the reduction of the gradient, the improvement of the roadbed, the strengthening of the bridges, and the addition of ferry boats, which are all important tasks for today's transportation improvement. The righteous or difficult to implement because of the cost of the project, and do not know that under the current deteriorating state of the highway, the damage of automobiles every year is calculated in hundreds of millions of yuan, which can sort out the national highway and have more than enough. The third is the application of human and animal power. After the highways are sorted out, the new improved carriages can pass unimpeded, using our country's own timber to build cars, using our own mules and horses to transport, not only cheap and labor-saving, and the foreign exchange burden due to gasoline saving will also be uncountable. Fourthly, the drainage of waterway, the southwest provinces, with vertical and horizontal canals, are rich in the profit of boats. A little drainage can be used for boats, and wood can be cut down the mountain to build ships along the river. The amount of a boat exceeds the car, which is not only convenient for military transportation, but also can smooth the flow of goods. The improvement of domestic transportation tools is more difficult to clumsy 塞到外的漏巵(leak of blocking) and increase the convenience of transportation. All four of these suggestions are easy to implement. If they can be promoted step by step, they can not only benefit military transportation, but also help the development of production and construction. (To be continued)

### British New Note Sent to Moscow, Lloyd George and Others Deliver Passionate Speeches, France Hopes UK and Soviet Union Will Establish an Agreement Quickly

[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] According to senior diplomatic officials here, who told the Associated Press reporter last night, British Foreign Secretary Halifax has already notified the French government that Britain has accepted the Soviet Union's proposal in principle. If the Soviet Union provokes a war due to assistance to Poland, Romania, and Turkey, Britain will provide assistance on a reciprocal basis. They also notified the French government that Britain's new note is on its way to Moscow. In the note, Britain suggests that the UK, France, and the Soviet Union mutually guarantee each other to deal with wars caused by the UK and France due to assistance to Poland, Romania, and Turkey. However, Britain still refuses to guarantee the small Baltic countries, but may invite the Soviet Union to participate in a joint guarantee to Poland, Romania, and Turkey. If the Soviet Union provokes a war due to assistance to Poland, Romania, and Turkey, the UK and France will certainly provide assistance.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 18th] According to political figures here, Britain's new note was sent out this afternoon. The British note is based on the original French plan, stating that if the Soviet Union is drawn into the war due to assistance to countries guaranteed by Britain and France, Britain and France will provide assistance. In other words, if the Soviet Union gets into the war due to assisting Poland and Romania, Britain and France will immediately provide assistance.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 18th] Before the British reply to the Soviet Union was sent out, diplomatic negotiations were underway. Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited the British Foreign Office several times. After the visit, he returned to the embassy and discussed with Moscow by long-distance telephone. The press here, especially 'Le Radicale', hopes that the UK-Soviet agreement can be established in the near future and believes that Chamberlain will be able to present a concrete report at the House of Commons meeting tomorrow afternoon. According to the newspaper's opinion, Britain does not want to take on too much burden in the current situation, so it is unwilling to publicly establish a military agreement, so as not to give more basis to the theory of encircling the Axis countries. 'Le Radicale' also stated that France had urged Britain to establish an agreement with the Soviet Union as soon as possible. 'Le Parisien' denied that the Foreign Office had put forward a compromise plan and said that if there was still no success when the League of Nations met, Halifax might go to Moscow.

[Reuters, London, 19th] Lloyd George delivered a passionate speech in the House of Commons today in a debate on diplomatic events, referring to the next action of the dictatorial countries. He said, "The preparation of the dictatorial countries at this time is unprecedented and worthy of attention. Its purpose is to defeat us. If we want to obtain peace in place of alley warfare, we can only prepare military strength to deal with emergencies and cooperate with all countries to resist aggression. Regarding the Soviet Union, if we are unwilling to approach it, but we have made guarantees to Poland and Romania, why not quickly decide to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union, just like establishing an agreement with France?" Opposition leader Attlee believed that Lloyd George had made a dark and true statement about the current world situation. Attlee believes that Britain has no constructive peace efforts at present, but is only waiting for the next act of aggression, and said, "We must recognize the aggressive policy of the Axis countries. The armed thugs in Europe are prepared to blackmail anyone."

Chamberlain Discusses Foreign Policy

[Reuters, London, 19th] When the House of Commons debated foreign policy today, Prime Minister Chamberlain (pictured) rose to speak after Attlee to cheers from the crowd. He began by saying that he did not want to discuss diplomatic issues today, because the present time is a tense, urgent, and apprehensive period. He knows very well that his words can be heard not only by all members, but also by the whole world, and studied carefully. "There are some people who have ulterior motives and specialize in picking on words, which may distort what is said today and produce misleading meanings. Mr. Attlee has said that a long-term peace policy is needed, and the colonial issue is also a part of it. We in this country have no intention of buying peace at the price of concessions, so it is enough to cause endless demands. However, this does not mean that we refuse to discuss with other countries any way to satisfy the emotions of other countries, even if that method is to revise the current situation. We are also willing to discuss it. If this method can guarantee a discussion in a good atmosphere, the problem may be easily solved. If there are no special difficulties during the negotiation, there may be more concessions, but the acquisition of this concession must be used for what it has promised, and cannot infringe upon the freedom of others. Until we are completely satisfied that the other party has abandoned the attempt to invade others, it is difficult for us to discuss the final conditions of peace.

German Government's Actions Contradict Guarantees

The German government has declared that it has no intention of annexing others, but unfortunately, those who oppose it dare not believe it, and there are many. This attitude of disbelief is also what the German government has caused (cheers). If we are sure that the other party has abandoned the attempt to invade and has no intention of using force between Germany and other countries, I believe that we will not shrink back for long and explain our views and routes for discussing permanent peace. The United States' greatest desire is to maintain peace, which should be believed with an international spirit. Britain's desire is only that various needs can be balanced in order to achieve the best completion. This means that the requirements and rights of all countries should be taken into account, and then we can discuss how to establish a route for lasting peace." Referring to Lloyd George's speech, Chamberlain said that he did not ignore the seriousness of the situation, but Lloyd George exaggerated it. There is nothing unusual or surprising about the withdrawal of the British Embassy in Prague. Regarding the permission to transfer Czech property abroad, which is helpful to Germany, Chamberlain said, "I really don't know whether the German government knows that its actions have caused a major reaction around the world. I believe that the German government's actions completely contradict the guarantees it has repeatedly given to the world. It has caused more unease among people around the world than its annexation of others. This contradiction has completely destroyed the sense of security and created a widespread feeling that once any small country is noticed by Germany's ambitions, it will be difficult to preserve its independence. Therefore, we increasingly feel that if we cannot use some new elements to stabilize the situation today, a large part of the European continent will disintegrate. The British government, in view of this, feels that it should immediately join hands with France to intervene. If France provides the above-mentioned elements to stabilize the situation, the threat of German aggression is quite acute, so we have to persuade quickly. However, the guarantees we have made to Poland and Turkey are not the final goal of our plan. These guarantees are proposed to avoid further deterioration of the situation, and can be called 'emergency measures'. In other words, we should go further and plan for a more permanent countermeasure to strengthen the power of the above guarantee and try to reach out to other great powers who are willing to contribute assistance. Although, I would still like to be clear that our policy does not mean that the European countries will form hostile groups. The formation of these groups is incited by mutual 'bad feelings' and they think the war is inevitable. Before the war has broken out, I never feel that war is inevitable, and the dimmer the situation and the more pressing the war is, the more I feel the need to make efforts to stop the war. We believe that any policy, if it aims to create hostile groups, is inherently unstable, so it is fundamentally dangerous. As for the policy we are following today, it has no aggressive components, and we will never refuse the opportunity to discuss all differences with an international spirit of amity. This is a policy of precaution and will not be implemented unless in a certain situation.

Must Prevent Violent Aggression

Whether that certain situation will happen or not, the power is in the hands of other countries. This means that our policy is to prevent violent acts of aggression. Acts of aggression may not happen, and we hope that they will never happen. This is a necessary policy. Without this policy, we cannot achieve stability in Europe, and the lives of businesses will be affected, and the living conditions of the people cannot be improved. We have offered guarantees to several countries, but this is not enough. We are willing to have other countries join and assist these countries together, so we are negotiating with the Soviet Union and Turkey. Regarding the UK-Turkish negotiations, the UK and Turkish governments quickly expressed the same interests and opinions, so a declaration was established on May 12. The declaration was warmly welcomed, which is enough to show the honor of Turkey and the preciousness of its friendship. UK-Turkish friendship began during the era of President Kemal, and under the current President, this friendship is increasing day by day.

[Reuters, London, 19th] The "News Chronicle's" correspondent in the Yugoslavian capital reports that Prince Paul has returned from Rome.

Brief Commentary

### Abrupt Tensions in the Shanghai International Settlement

According to news reports today, the situation in the Shanghai International Settlement has suddenly become tense. Settlement authorities have implemented special martial law, with all foreign troops, police, and volunteer corps mobilized. The streets and alleys are filled with uniforms, firearms, and barbed wire, creating a state of wartime readiness.

The fundamental reason for the tension in Shanghai lies in Japan's preparation to implement armed occupation. The sudden and unprecedented surge in tension in the past two days indicates that the settlement authorities are unwilling to surrender all rights and interests to Japan. The emergency measures taken by the settlement authorities, similar to the landing of British, American, and French sailors on Gulangyu, is a clear warning to Japan: "Do not go too far. Britain, America, and France will not easily withdraw from the Far East!"

However, we remain pessimistic about the future of Shanghai, as we do about the Gulangyu incident and the situations in Tianjin and Hankou. Firstly, the desire to seize the concessions in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and other European powers' bases of influence and interests in the Far East is not only part of Japan's overall invasion plan, but also a necessary and urgent measure to remedy and reverse their setbacks in the invasion of China. Therefore, unless subjected to effective strikes by European and American powers, Japan's harassing actions will never "stop at the appropriate point"! All menacing threats are simply Japan's proud tactics and will certainly not scare them away! Secondly, the measures currently taken by the European and American democratic and peaceful countries to restrain Japan are obviously not strong enough. Moreover, the tactics employed by the settlement authorities today, such as overstepping their authority to suppress Chinese newspapers that support China, and carrying out large-scale crackdowns on anti-Japanese elements, may be said to be aimed at avoiding pretexts for Japan to provoke greater incidents. However, since Japan is looking for opportunities, they will not lack excuses. Instead of upholding law and order based on justice and the concession bylaws, they are yielding to Japan's demands by violating the laws, which not only undermine their own position but also provide Japan with opportunities to exploit. In the future, all Chinese residents in the concessions can be labeled as anti-Japanese or communist, and even if all Chinese are expelled, Westerners can still be accused of supporting China, being anti-Japanese, or being communist. What unimaginable disasters will lie ahead?

Therefore, we believe that in order to prevent Japan from further implementing armed occupation and annexation, the landing of British, American, and French sailors on Gulangyu and the adoption of wartime preparations by the Shanghai settlement authorities as demonstrations of strength against Japan are absolutely necessary and appropriate. We believe that our compatriots residing in Shanghai and other concessions will be happy to accept various restrictions in order to see the demonstrations of strength by democratic and peaceful allies such as Britain, America, and France. However, if there are only these demonstrations without further effective restraints on Japan, or even if these demonstrations severely suppress all anti-Japanese and anti-aggression forces, it will not only fail to prevent Japan's further encroachments but may even fuel their arrogance! Therefore, our task today is to intensify all diplomatic efforts, urge democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain, America, and France not to miss the last opportunity, strengthen their own unity, and step up efforts to support China and restrain Japan. Otherwise, what China loses will be only this much, while the European and American democratic and peaceful allies will be forced to withdraw completely from the Far East. In addition, all parties should learn from the experiences of Shanghai and Gulangyu, become serious and vigilant, abandon decadent and degenerate behaviors, and actively promote all work to return to the country and assist the motherland! Times are critical, don't dream anymore!

### Air Defense Commissioner Officially Announces Emergency Air Defense Drills Will Be Conducted at Any Time: No Prior Notice Will Be Given to Residents, Who Should Be Prepared for Blackouts at All Times; Seven New Siren Machines Arriving from England Will Reach Hong Kong During the Day

Hong Kong's air defense work, according to the original plan of the Hong Kong government, is being actively carried out. After more than ten months, considerable progress has been made, and the air defense work has entered another stage. It is understood that the current air defense authorities are actively seeking residents' cooperation with the government, widely promoting air defense, so that all residents of Hong Kong, regardless of gender or age, can understand and acquire knowledge about escaping air raids. On the one hand, they are intensifying the planning of disaster relief locations and the deployment of resident evacuation, so that in the event of war and Hong Kong being attacked, residents can follow the common sense they have acquired and evacuate in an orderly manner, without being caught off guard. Regarding blackout drills, several have been held in the past two years, but they have all been of a general nature. The authorities announced the dates in advance each time. This kind of regular exercise cannot meet the needs of wartime. Therefore, the Air Defense Committee has decided to hold a wartime air defense exercise in the near future to train residents to respond to emergencies. Regarding the duration of the exercise, the authorities have not yet made a clear announcement. The reporter interviewed the Air Defense Commissioner yesterday, who said that the air defense exercise could be held at any time. In order to test whether residents can calmly cope, the date must be kept secret and no prior notice will be given. During this period, residents of Hong Kong should be fully prepared at all times to avoid panic in an emergency. As for the sirens, the number was previously too small, and the sirens could not be spread to all areas of Hong Kong. Since the new sirens arrived from England a few days ago, a test has been done and good results have been obtained. A total of six of these new sirens have now arrived in Hong Kong, distributed in various areas of Hong Kong. There are still seven more being shipped from England and will arrive in Hong Kong during the day. The installation locations of these seven new sirens have not yet been determined and may be distributed in the Kowloon area in the future.

### China Salvation Drama Troupe Hosts Reception Today: Benefit Performances are Imminent, Departing Abroad Immediately After Performances to Seek Guidance; Notable Figures from All Walks of Life Invited to Attend

The China Salvation Drama Troupe, which has been fighting on the northern front for twenty months and is loved by millions of soldiers and civilians, will go to the Nanyang area to comfort overseas Chinese and complete a greater propaganda and economic mission. Since arriving in Hong Kong, the troupe has been warmly welcomed by various organizations. Various groups have admired the troupe's skilled theatrical arts and requested it to perform a large-scale public performance in Hong Kong before leaving China, in order to raise funds for disaster relief and expand the propaganda for national salvation. It has now been scheduled to perform "Long Live the Nation," "Defend the Motherland," and "Spring in Taierzhuang" and other famous plays at the Lee Theatre on the evenings of the 25th, 26th, and 27th of this month, which will surely create an unprecedented and grand occasion in Hong Kong. Entrusted by the Disaster Relief Federation, the Reporters Association, which is responsible for preparing the event, is stepping up its work due to the approaching performance date. It specially convened a "Salvation Drama Troupe Benefit Performance Committee" yesterday afternoon at 4:00 to discuss everything. Tickets are divided into five types: three yuan, two yuan, one yuan, five dimes, and two and a half dimes, and have also been distributed for sale. All sectors have a high belief in the troupe, and since the matter is to raise funds for disaster relief, the sale of tickets will surely proceed smoothly. It is heard that the troupe will leave the country immediately after the performance. The period in Hong Kong is approaching, and in order to seek guidance widely and thank all parties for their kind intentions, a tea party will be held at 3:00 p.m. today on the second floor of the Astor Hotel to invite celebrities from all walks of life, as well as the press, education, and theater to attend and provide guidance. A grand occasion is expected. It is also heard that the troupe has compiled a special publication for the performance, with extremely wonderful content, which has now been sent to the printers and will be published during the performance.

### Increasing Water Supply in Hong Kong: Submarine Water Pipes Near Completion; Can Temporarily Increase Water Supply by One Million Gallons; Will Increase to Sixteen Million Gallons in the Future

In order to increase the amount of water supplied to Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Water Authority has added a submarine water pipe to transport water stored in the Shing Mun Reservoir to Hong Kong. The project began in November last year and has been underway for several months. The completion date is not far away. The last few sections of the water pipes were also installed in the sea in front of the Queen's Pier yesterday. After the new pipe is installed, the amount of water supplied to Hong Kong Island from the Shing Mun Reservoir will increase compared to before. The old pipe supplied 8 million gallons of water per day to Hong Kong Island from the Shing Mun Reservoir. The new pipe will temporarily increase the supply by 1 million gallons. Once the second new main pipe is installed in the Kowloon Peninsula, it can be increased to 16 million gallons. The new main pipe has now been installed to Waterloo Road, where the water source will be connected. The Public Works Department engineers encountered many difficulties during the installation of the new submarine water pipe. When it was placed in the middle of Hong Kong Harbour, the project was suspended from time to time due to the rapid currents. Work could only be carried out when the flow slowed down. However, the difficulty of this project lies in connecting each section of the water pipe, ensuring that the two ends fit together perfectly. For this reason, the engineers used an installation machine for accurate measurement. This makes it easier for the coppersmiths to work. The inside diameter of the water pipe is 21 inches, and the old ones are only 12 or 18 inches. The inside of the pipe is attached with a layer of cement concrete, half an inch thick, to prevent corrosion. The outside is also attached with two and a half inches of cement concrete to prevent corrosion and damage from seawater and other causes. Each section of the water pipe is 55 feet long, and each two sections are connected with an extensible joint. After each section is connected, it is tested with a pressure of 300 pounds to see if it is properly connected. In addition, the project still has to connect to the Queen's Pier and the Kowloon Station underground. Once the work is completed in these two locations, the water supply to Hong Kong from the Kowloon Reservoir will be very abundant.

### Continue to Carry Forward the Fighting Spirit of the Martyrs: "Huanghuagang" to be Restaged Tonight: Hong Kong Film and Theater Circles Celebrate Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's Fiftieth Birthday

— Qi Zhuo

The spirit of "Huanghuagang" that created the Republic of China should be carried forward; the sensational Hong Kong performance of "Huanghuagang" should be repeated—

Time: Today and tomorrow;

Address: Kowloon Po Hing Theatre.

Why restage "Huanghuagang"?

First, to promote the spirit of fighting and sacrificing for national liberation;

Second, to raise funds for the Disaster Relief Federation to comfort the war dead and their families, and to comfort the martyrs in the afterlife;

Third, to consolidate and promote the unprecedented unity of the Hong Kong drama community.

In addition to the three points similar to the last time, there are new meanings in this restaging of "Huanghuagang".

First, the last performance of "Huanghuagang" was successful, and this great harvest should be broadcast;

Second, move to Kowloon in order to be universal. Let revolutionary thoughts and revolutionary actions occur in every corner.

Third, it is a gift from the Hong Kong drama community to celebrate the 50th birthday of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, a drama instructor.

——Looking at it this way, this performance. The significance of "Huanghuagang" is even more profound than last time.

Why should Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's birthday be celebrated? Because Mr. Ouyang is a pioneer in the Chinese drama world, and his decades of fighting spirit are worthy of praise and pride. Since the Anti-Japanese War, he has made no small contribution to the salvation drama and national defense films. We should give this old and strong artistic pioneer comfort and encouragement.

In addition to the sincere birthday wishes and unlimited hopes from the drama community for Mr. Ouyang, the China Art Troupe specially held a banquet to celebrate last night. Invite cultural, film, and drama circles in Hong Kong, with more than 200 participants, and the atmosphere was warm and lively for a while. China Film Studio also sent staff to shoot news films, and it was not until 1:00 a.m. that the party ended. Tonight at 8:00 p.m., a joint benefit performance of "Huanghuagang" will be held at the Po Hing Theatre to celebrate. Tickets are priced at two dimes, five dimes, one yuan, and two yuan to make it universal. Singing groups attending include the Chinese Amateur Chorus, the Guofeng Hao Singing Team, the Chinese Bookstore Singing Team, and the Fourth Women's Training Class Singing Team. It is hoped that the compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon will not miss this rare opportunity. At the same time, the Central Theatre is screening "Xiao Lingzi", the Cathay Theatre is screening "The Peach Blossom Fan", and the Nathan Theatre is screening "Mulan Joins the Army" and other famous films to help celebrate. All income will be donated by Mr. Ouyang to the Disaster Relief Federations. The above films are all masterpieces of Mr. Ouyang, and the film rental is donated by Huacheng and Huasheng Companies, and the theatre rental is donated by Central, Cathay, and Nathan Theatres. This is also a first in Hong Kong.

——Such a birthday celebration is a unique expression of the film and drama circles and is a very meaningful event. Taking advantage of Mr. Ouyang's birthday today, in addition to paying our highest national tribute to Mr. Ouyang and wishing him eternal youth, we should provide some suggestions from the standpoint of a journalist as a birthday gift:

1. The united front and common development of the drama community is an urgent task at present. Even if some people do not have common beliefs or mutual trust, this is an inevitable transitional phenomenon. It is hoped that Mr. Ouyang will continue to work hard and lead it well.

2. It is hoped that under the leadership of Mr. Ouyang, "Chinese Art" will carry out more meaningful and other salvation work in addition to salvation dramas, which will surely have greater success and greater effect. "Even eating and love are related to the invasion of the enemy." Mr. Lu Xun's statement is not wrong in our common experience.

3. The members of the Chinese Art Troupe, who have been trained for many years, are quite skilled in acting. It is hoped that Mr. Ouyang will lead them to go further and shoulder greater tasks of the times in all aspects more substantively and strongly.

### Landlords are Again Forcing Tenants to Install Water Meters Themselves: Using Water Meters as a Means to Exploit Housing and Increase Rent

Some landlords in Hong Kong, fearing the extension of the anti-eviction ordinance, are again carrying out last year's failed attempt. Before the Hong Kong government implemented the ice fee regulations on January 1st of this year, landlords took the opportunity to force tenants to install their own water meters under the pretext of complying with government regulations. Later, the authorities learned about this and promulgated an emergency ordinance, stating that if tenants were forced by landlords and not of their own free will, the Water Authority would reject their request. After the ordinance was implemented, the landlords had to comply. Recently, the landlords have not given up on this matter and have even consulted several times. The initial method is to ask the government to remove the existing water meters, and automatically reduce the rent, so that the tenants can install the water meters themselves and pay the water bills. The main purpose of the landlords is to earn an extra ten yuan in rent per water meter per year, and at the same time, they can get the deposit back. Secondly, there is a current shortage of housing. If the method is implemented, tenants will have to install their own water meters at a cost of sixty yuan (including the deposit, labor, and materials). Once installed, it will be difficult to move. At that time, the water meter can be used to exploit the tenants. If the tenant does not want to dismantle the meter when moving out and suffer losses, the landlord can take advantage of the situation and ask the tenant to find a replacement, and then rent it to a new tenant with high-sounding reasons and increase the rent again. Based on the above two points, it is no wonder that the landlords, who value money as their lives, disregard the suffering of the residents and act recklessly.

### Guangdong Relief Association and Hong Kong and Macau Student Relief Committee: Teacher Registration Lottery Held Yesterday: More Than 300 People Were Hired as a Result

The Provincial Relief Association and the Hong Kong and Macau Student Relief Committee recently held teacher registration, which ended on the 14th. Statistics show that a total of 1,520 teachers registered in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau. However, the quota was only 300. Therefore, the lottery was held at 2:00 p.m. yesterday at the library of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Yi Boyang, the person in charge of the Relief Association, announced the reasons for the lottery, saying that there are currently 1,520 teachers registered in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau. The Association has specially set the priority employment standards, and the employment methods are divided into six types: (1) Education: (1) Graduates of domestic and foreign university education departments, normal universities, or university normal departments or higher normal schools, (2) Graduates of old-style normal schools or new-style high school normal schools, (2) Experience: Served in a registered complete primary school for more than three years, (3) Teaching performance: Awarded by provincial, municipal, and county education departments or bureaus, (4) Certificates: Original certificates are fully submitted for inspection, (5) Family situation: Truly unemployed and the family is poor, (6) Service situation: Worked hard during the Anti-Japanese War.

Special Announcement

### Nanhua Singing Class

— Falling Sunset

The Third Session Was Born Last Night

"Arise! Ye who refuse to be slaves!" The roar of the Chinese nation echoes in every corner, inspiring every decadent person! Song, a majestic song, is like the bayonet in the hand of the soldiers at the front, a sharp weapon. In Hong Kong, the person in charge of the entertainment department of the Nanhua Sports Association has, in the midst of hardship, created a patriotic singing class. Gathering hundreds of excellent young people, he uses their weapon—song—to defeat the shameless collaborators. Now, this singing class has grown to be three years old. Although the number of people in the first session was only about one hundred, under everyone's hard work and training, the results were very excellent. They had participated in various charitable fundraising public performances and received very positive reviews. So, in the second session, the number increased to over three hundred, and the situation became even more enthusiastic.

Yesterday was the night of the birth of the third session of the singing class. In a wide hall, a group of lively young people gathered together, talking and laughing, filling the hall with joyful smiles. When the silver whistle blew, everyone quietly returned to their seats. The solemn national anthem filled the hall. The chairman gave a brief report on the history of the singing class, followed by a lighthearted introduction ceremony. The chairman, the secretary… one by one, the young people ran to the stage with smiles, gave a ninety-degree bow, and paid their respects to everyone. Then, the majestic song rose again. Mr. Zheng Guoping, the instructor of the Guangzhou Anti-______ Mobilization Committee, appeared with a smile and gave a stern speech, followed by another song.

Participating in the opening ceremony of the Nanhua Singing Class, we deeply feel the greatness of song and the admirable qualities of the person in charge of this singing class. However, starting a business is difficult. In Hong Kong, training a group of young people far from the front lines is certainly a difficult task. Therefore, everyone should work hard to overcome all difficulties!

### "Dead City" Four-Day Experience Record

A representative of the Hong Kong South China Morning Post recently traveled from Hong Kong to Guangzhou and stayed in the "Dead City" for four days. Upon his return, he wrote a "Dead City" Four-Day Experience Record, which was published in the newspaper. It provides a factual report on the desolate state of Guangzhou under _____ occupation, the chaotic financial situation, and the dark world of rampant robbers. The absurdity of the _____ propaganda that Guangzhou has recovered its prosperity can be refuted by anyone who has been to Guangzhou, and the _____ plot to attract people back to the city is difficult to achieve. The true face of Guangzhou after the fall can be glimpsed by reading the article.

The article first describes the author's experience of arriving in Guangzhou from Macau and the impressions he gained. He said that upon arriving in Guangzhou, on the way from the dock to Shamian by rickshaw, he was able to glimpse the face of Guangzhou after the looting. The first impression was reminiscent of the reports of the Great Fire of Guangzhou in the newspapers. The dilapidated walls and desolate scenery. Few large buildings were spared by the fire. The embankment was relatively prosperous. Most of the streets were deserted. Public buses and private cars were rare. The only vehicles running on the road were Japanese military vehicles, shuttling back and forth busily. At street intersections, there were often many Japanese soldiers, searching pedestrians in groups. Every few hundred yards, there was a Japanese soldier on sentry duty, with a stern look, making passers-by avoid him. Shamian was also affected, with business being unusually sluggish. Although the stores were open as usual, the staff had been greatly reduced. The Victoria Hotel was deserted, with only the author and his companion as guests. The number of foreigners in Shamian had sharply decreased, from several hundred to only fifty. Prices were the same as in Hong Kong, but fruits and vegetables were surprisingly expensive. Imported goods were no longer available in Guangzhou, and the shops sold Japanese goods. Most of the shops in the city were run by Japanese. Guangzhou has become a dumping ground for Japanese goods.

The financial situation in Guangzhou is extremely chaotic. The Japanese army ordered the citizens to use Japanese military scrip and prohibited the circulation of legal tender. However, most citizens were happy to use legal tender, so legal tender was still circulating in the market, but stores and restaurants run by the Japanese refused to use it. Guangzhou has become a dead city, with desolation everywhere. Few citizens have returned to the city. The exact number of people in Guangzhou is difficult to ascertain. According to a merchant in Shamian, it is estimated to be about 500,000, but another estimate is 150,000. According to a Japanese merchant, it is said that it is no more than 200,000 at most. According to the author's observation, the current population of Guangzhou is about 100,000, mostly from the poor classes. Although some merchants once returned to the city, they soon reopened because the area was unstable, robbers were rampant, and there was no business to be done. Those who were slightly wealthy were unwilling to stay in the dead city to be disturbed. Because the city was unstable, a curfew was announced at night. In fact, the Japanese army was on high alert day and night. There are about 10,000 Japanese soldiers in the city. As for whether or not there were battles taking place in the suburbs, it was difficult to ascertain. According to a Japanese military officer who spoke to the author, there were no battles within 30 miles of Guangzhou, but two days ago, Shamian still heard clear artillery fire. While the author was staying in Guangzhou, he often saw Japanese military vehicles carrying large numbers of wounded Japanese soldiers back to the city.

Movies and Drama

### Charlie Chaplin Receives Threats While Filming His New Film "The Dictator". Employs Special Guards for Rotation. Decides Not to Waver from His Original Intention and Works Hard to Proceed.

Charlie Chaplin, the giant of screen comedy, is making his new sound film, "The Dictator," the content of which, as everyone knows, is a satire of a certain dictator. He emphasizes the stupidity and absurdity of certain barbaric and unreasonable political phenomena in the current world situation and brings them to the screen in the form of comedy.

Striking the soul of those people before the world, of course, will make a certain kind of person feel angry and threatened, and therefore use their consistent rogue methods against Chaplin—threats—murder.

"The Dictator" has already started filming and is currently being actively produced. However, since it was decided to film this film, Chaplin has received countless threatening letters, mostly saying that "The Dictator" contains "defamatory" meanings, and demanding that he stop filming immediately, otherwise they will use terrorist methods to "put Chaplin to death." In order to prevent being murdered, Chaplin has recently hired an armed bodyguard who stays close to him to protect him day and night. Special detectives are also sent to monitor him while he eats his three meals a day to prevent bad people from poisoning him. At the same time, during the filming of the film, the surroundings of the studio are also guarded, and the situation is quite serious. However, it is said that although Chaplin has been threatened by the terrorists, his original intention has not wavered in the slightest. On the contrary, the production of "The Dictator" is currently being actively intensified, day and night, in order to present "this ridiculous comedy to the world's forward-thinking people" in the shortest possible time. According to Hollywood filmmakers, it is unprecedented in film history to be so heavily guarded, as if they were important figures in the political world.

### Hollywood Movie Star Representative Works

— Continued

Spencer Tracy, speaking of "Captains Courageous," it is even stronger than "Boy's Town" (this film has not yet been released in Hong Kong). It's just that Spencer Tracy plays a jovial father, and it's still felt that his personality is not very suitable.

Robert Young, "H.M. Pulham, Esq." is often regarded as Robert Young's representative work.

Nelson Eddy, with Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald's collaboration, "Maytime" is considered the most splendid.

Herbert Marshall, Herbert's "Trouble in Paradise" is also the best work of the newcomer Simone Simon.

Bruce Cabot, Bruce's "Suicide Squad" and "Sinners in Paradise" are indeed better than "Letty Lynton" and "Ann Vickers."

Dick Powell, Dick's works are difficult to distinguish. If strictly compared, then "Gold Diggers of 1935," co-starring with Alice Faye and Madelyn Carroll, is the most vivid.

Bing Crosby, Bing's song films are also difficult to compare. "Double or Nothing" seems to be the best recent work. (To be continued)

George Raft, George has also been less in the news recently. "Souls at Sea" is worth mentioning.

Charles Laughton's "Ruggles of Red Gap," which is a purely dramatic performance, is Charles Laughton's only successful work.

George Arliss, George may have become a retired actor. However, "The House of Rothschild" is indeed a successful work.

Edward G. Robinson, Edward's "Five Star Final," "Little Caesar," etc., are all famous works. "I Am the Law" is more vivid.

Ronald Colman, "A Tale of Two Cities" can be called his representative work. If there is an acting, the result will definitely be a failure.

Warner Baxter, Warner's style is similar to Colman's, and his best film is "The Prisoner of Shark Island."

Basil Rathbone, although John Barrymore and Lionel Atwill have recently been in supporting roles in famous films, their performances are still well received by the audience. John has had two films before, "Of Human Bondage" and "The Mad Genius." In the former, John played a lawyer, and his acting was just right. Lionel's "Dinner at Eight" and his recent film "You Can't Take It With You" are both good.

Leslie Howard, this British artist has two of the best films made in the South—one is "The Scarlet Pimpernel" and the other is "Pygmalion." The latter has not yet been released in Hong Kong. Both films were produced in Britain. "Intermezzo" is often considered his successful performance in Hollywood.

Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Douglas Fairbanks Jr. has recently recovered. Although his role in "The Prisoner of Shark Island" is small, he still received good reviews. "The Corsican Brothers" is also a good work.

Robert Donat, Robert's "The Citadel" is rumored to be even better than "The Count of Monte Cristo."

Charles Boyer, "All This, and Heaven Too" is better than "Conquest." His recent "Algiers" is the representative work.

Melvyn Douglas, Melvyn's representative work should be "Mr. and Mrs. Smith," co-starring with Carole Lombard. His performance in "That Uncertain Feeling" is also not bad.

Henry Fonda, "The Story of Alexander Graham Bell" is enough to rival Paul Muni's "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang."

Victor McLaglen, "The Informer" is definitely his representative work.

"I said I would make her like a duchess." As he said that, he excitedly took out a large envelope, "Look, this is an invitation to a dance from the Transylvanian Embassy. I have decided to take her there as a duchess."

The day to leave for the dance was getting closer and closer. Eliza worked hard to learn all the manners and etiquette, and finally that day came quickly. Higgins scratched his messy hair and said to Eliza, "Let's practice one more time."

She was extremely tired, covered her face with her hands, and said disappointedly, "I—I can't do it."

Although there were many things in the embassy's magnificent ballroom that were worth being interested in, Higgins stood absentmindedly next to Pickering, because he was uneasily stepping onto the key to success and failure, worried about the outcome. He had just seen a face that dispelled his hopes. This man now walked over, a smile on his face, and said,

"Professor Higgins, do you remember me? I am Alex Carbotti. You taught me phonetics. You can point out where a person was born in England, but I can point out where they were born in Europe. I am your best student."

Higgins knew that the man indeed had the same ability as himself. After the man left, he told Pickering, "If he hears Eliza, I'm done."

"I want a better job," he continued. "But because my accent is wrong, people don't want me. Can you help me?"

### South China Football Team to Play Charity Match with Joint Team Today. Hui Tang of South China and Da Gao of Joint Team to Compete. South China to Play Friendly Match with Foreign Sailors Tomorrow.

(Special report from this newspaper) The South China Athletic Association's football team, in the 1928-29 season, established a glorious achievement that will benefit future generations. It is truly rare and will be forever immortalized.

However, although their players have the glory of winning championships, they still do not consider this to be satisfactory. For learning is endless, and diligence leads to success. Recently, in response to an invitation from the Nanyang region, they are making an expedition again, departing on the 24th of this month on the French postal ship Bodume.

Even on the eve of departure, they are still generous. The South China touring team, at the invitation of the association's emergency work service corps, will play a charity match with the joint team at Caroline Hill at 5:15 pm today. This move is both for the sake of the compatriots in distress and also an opportunity to practice fully in preparation for the tour of Southeast Asia.

Today's tickets are divided into three types: one dollar, sixty cents, and thirty cents. However, viewers must not buy them outside the stadium, because fake tickets have recently appeared. Please do not be fooled.

Tomorrow at 5:15 pm, the touring team has also arranged a friendly match with the sailors of the British warship HMS Gannet, also at Caroline Hill. The ticket prices may be cheaper than today.

After the football season ends, many players go into seclusion. Therefore, although today's lineup for the joint team is arranged by the association, the South China Athletic Association first sought the consent of each member, who all agreed to contribute to the charity. This is how it can be realized. Since they have agreed to play, it is believed that they will not back down at the last minute.

The lineup for the joint team was announced the day before yesterday and looks exceptionally complete. The forward line has Da Gao, Shan Nu, Hou Chengtuo, Tuo Ban, etc., all first-class players, and their attacking power will definitely be sharp. The defense has Gu Ba, Xu Jingcheng, Hou Rongheng, Shi Han, etc., who are also well-known figures. If they all work together, it will definitely be pleasing to the eye.

The lineup for South China was only decided yesterday afternoon, showing a completely new look. In particular, the forward line has been positioned to suit each individual's abilities, and there is no longer the disadvantage of forcing people into positions they are not suited for. Moreover, in addition to the two wings being fixed, the three forwards can mutually adjust their positions when necessary, because all three forwards are suitable for both left and right, and can perform as desired in any position. This is the characteristic of today's forward line.

Some people say, "In exhibition matches that have no championship implications, the performances are never very intense." This situation may exist, but it is not necessarily the case. Because the two teams become enemies when they face each other. All who are involved in the battle will undoubtedly have the mentality of doing their best and striving for victory. Especially when the teams are evenly matched, the competition is even fiercer. They will not abandon their goal of achieving victory simply because there is no championship involved. It is believed that today these two teams, precisely because they are evenly matched, will have the ambition to not give in easily and will have the most exciting performances.

The various games of this year's Open Men's Basketball Second Division League, which were postponed due to previous events, have now been rescheduled by the League as follows:

### School Volleyball Competition Wah Yan forfeits, Pui Ying wins without effort There are six games today

Yesterday's scheduled School Volleyball Competition originally included three games at the senior, junior, and children's levels. However, when the senior Wah Yan vs. Pui Ying game came, Wah Yan was nowhere to be seen, so the referee ruled that Wah Yan had forfeited and Pui Ying had won. In the junior Wah Yan vs. Yu Cai game, Wah Yan's middle and rear rows were not perfect, with many misunderstandings, while the front row was more balanced. Yu Cai's side was unified, with the front and middle rows able to respond to each other, while the back row was slightly weaker. However, the overall coordination was very good and the entire line was stable, so Wah Yan was defeated zero to three. The first game was 21-9, the second game was 21-12, and the third game was 21-7.

In the children's grade, Fang Zhong vs. Ying Huang, Fang Zhong's entire army was quite strong in combat, and their attack and defense were consistent, so they won three to zero. The first game was 21-17, the second game was 21-2, and the third game was 21-13. Today, there are two games in each grade. The order is as follows:

Senior, Blake Garden Court

Ying Huang vs. Wah Yan, 3:30 PM

### Forging Football Tickets Defendant Guilty Fined or Imprisoned

Xu Ruifen, a teenager, 18 years old, was charged with selling four forged South China Athletic Association tickets at Caroline Hill on the 17th of this month. The case was heard yesterday morning by the Central Patrol Court. The case was prosecuted by English detective Jia Shiman. It was stated that the final battle for the Xuhe Cup was held at the South China Stadium at 5:15 pm on the 17th of this month. At that time, many people from all walks of life bought tickets to enter the stadium. At that time, the defendant was holding four South China Athletic Association fifty-cent tickets and selling them to people. He charged sixty cents for each ticket. Later, a person named Ou Yaoliang, without realizing it, bought the ticket from the defendant. When he held the ticket to enter the stadium, the gatekeeper discovered that it was a fake ticket. The official asked the defendant where he printed this kind of fake ticket. The defendant said that this kind of fake ticket was printed at a printing office at a certain number on Luoke Road. English detective Jia Shiman then stated to the official that when the police obtained the defendant's confession, they had already sent personnel to investigate the printing office, but the office did not have this kind of fake ticket. The official sentenced the defendant to a fine of fifty yuan or two months in prison.

### Current Students' Reforms for Physical Training Should Have (3)

— Zou Falu

Gymnastics has always been criticized as being rigid and boring, and the amount of exercise is minimal. Students who only value freedom will not even bother to look at it. However, it has special value: the difficulty is profound, the boundaries are clear, and the old, young, strong, and weak can all do it; it is symmetrical on the left and right, and comprehensive on the top and bottom, and all parts of the body can benefit; it does not choose time and place, and does not limit the number of people, and can be done anytime and anywhere; and its main feature is that it does not require a small amount of money, and it is the basic exercise of all sports.

Activated apparatus gymnastics is an exercise that most people think is too difficult to do, but movements such as vaulting over the pommel horse and side horse and releasing the hand on the uneven bars can foster a spirit of boldness, carefulness, bravery, and adventure; exercises on the mat, such as handstands, single and double swings, rotations, etc., can cultivate a sense of response to obvious rotations and rapid ascents and descents in aviation technology; and the dexterity and agility of the movements can also cultivate the ability to cope with ease when fighting on the battlefield.

Guoshu (Chinese martial arts) is a traditional method of body training in our country for thousands of years. The subtlety of its movements and the mystery of its changes are its unique functions. Although modern warfare relies on airplanes and cannons, when it comes to charging and hand-to-hand combat, Guoshu can show great power. In the past war of resistance, there were countless glorious battles in which the power of Guoshu was used to kill enemies.

Military sports, such as climbing, crossing obstacles, jumping over obstacles, climbing mountains, rolling forward, and throwing hand grenades, not only can be directly applied in the event of a battle, achieving the effect of being able to handle things with ease, command freely, and kill enemies; but also is a sport that is rich in naturalness, and we can use it as a substitute for track and field.

Although the above-mentioned sports have not been completely covered, they have given an outline. We can choose and follow them according to the current needs of sports rehabilitation, and considering the performance of various sports. Students can also understand the reforms needed for physical training materials.

3. Reform of practice methods: Exercise can strengthen the body, and whether the effect can be achieved quickly depends on whether the practice method is appropriate. If the practice method is appropriate, there is no need to be timid and look around, and the work done will not be in vain at all; otherwise, hesitating and hesitating will inevitably lead to futile efforts.

Economic Column

### Shanghai Lacks Investment Opportunities; Changes in the Domestic Economic Environment; The Abnormal Prosperity of the Shanghai Market Should Not Be Overly Optimistic; Development of the Southwest Economy Depends on Transportation Construction; Annual Report of Rising Banks

The annual report of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank for the 27th year of the Republic [1938] stated: Due to the spread of war, the domestic economic situation this year has suffered unprecedented misfortune, and the losses have been the heaviest in our country's history. Moreover, due to the different impacts of the war on various regions, various abnormal phenomena have occurred. In general, both production and consumption have declined. As for the economic situation abroad, the situations in various countries vary greatly due to different environments and policies, but signs of recession seem to be more prevalent. The following is a summary of the domestic economic situation, divided into finance, trade, prices, and industry and commerce:

Finance: Following the financial panic of last autumn, the "Regulations for Stabilizing Finance" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance continued to be implemented. The Discount and Loan Committee organized by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China also successively handled discount and loan matters in various regions. In addition, the government was determined to maintain the legal tender, and the governments and financial institutions of friendly countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States also provided assistance when appropriate. Therefore, although the war situation deteriorated day by day, the financial market was able to remain stable as usual. Not only was there no run on banks, but a large amount of previously fled capital also returned. Except for a few small banks, no financial institutions went bankrupt. The Shanghai interbank lending rate did not fluctuate abnormally throughout the year, and even the unofficial market for government bonds rose steadily. All of this was beyond our expectations and is gratifying. In this relatively stable situation, there were also some important events that deserve our attention, roughly as follows:

Black Market for Foreign Exchange: At the beginning of this year, the government continued to strive to maintain the statutory exchange rate. Later, due to environmental factors, on March 14, the "Measures for Foreign Exchange Application and Verification" were promulgated, stipulating that when banks needed foreign exchange for legitimate purposes after offsetting receipts and payments, they could apply to the Central Bank for purchase. After approval by the Central Bank, foreign exchange was sold at the statutory price, so as to appropriately limit the supply of foreign exchange. In June, regulations were successively issued to restrict the types of imported goods, and foreign exchange from exported goods should also be sold to national banks. On August 8, it was stipulated that applications for foreign exchange for goods shipped for import after January 1 of this year would no longer be accepted, except for necessities. The market's demand for foreign exchange could not be fully satisfied, and the so-called "black market" arose accordingly. The unofficial exchange rate of legal tender gradually declined from one shilling two and a half pence, reaching a low of seven pence eight seven five in August. However, since the second half of the year, the exchange rate in this black market has often hovered above eight pence. After the establishment of British and American loans, it became even more stable. It can be seen that the value of legal tender, even under the manipulation of the black market, can still maintain a considerable degree of stability.

Transfer Draft Discount: Shanghai's transfer drafts were originally scheduled to be cashed the next day. However, after the Ministry of Finance implemented the "Measures for Stabilizing Finance," the so-called interbank transfer drafts could only be used for transfers and could not be cashed, nor could they be used to purchase foreign exchange. Since its use was restricted, a discount method arose when it was exchanged for cash. This had already shown signs in the second half of last year, and this year it became even more intensified. Later, the Joint Reserve Board stepped in to maintain it and injected a large amount of funds, and it was then calmed down. By the end of this year, the amount of legal tender in the market had increased considerably, and the transfer draft discount had tended to decrease. Therefore, since the outbreak of the war, the Shanghai financial market has added a new type of fund. Customers often have to open two accounts, one for legal tender and one for transfer drafts, which is also an abnormal phenomenon of wartime finance. This year, the war gradually moved westward, and transportation between Shanghai and the interior became increasingly inconvenient. Before and during the war, the quantity of goods from Shanghai to the interior was quite large, while it was not easy to transport a large amount of local goods out of the interior and they were controlled by the government. The amount of funds remitted from the interior to Shanghai far exceeded the amount remitted from Shanghai to the interior, so the exchange rate became increasingly high, and there was the pain of not being able to adjust the exchange rate anywhere. In addition, the exchange rate between Shanghai and various ports in North China was also quite chaotic, so it was not easy for funds in various regions to support each other, which was also affected by the war.

Shanghai Capital: Since the war in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, the number of people from the interior who came to Shanghai to seek refuge has increased day by day, and a large amount of capital from the war zone has flowed in. Moreover, a considerable amount of capital that purchased foreign exchange before and during the war has returned due to the accumulation of interest. Therefore, Shanghai's capital has gradually become abundant, and the current deposits of financial institutions have increased considerably. The market funds have become increasingly loose, and speculative activities have followed, from the buying and selling of foreign currencies, gold, and stocks to the hoarding of various commodities, which is even more prosperous than before the war. Using funds for unproductive purposes cannot but be regarded as a wartime economic worry.

Southwest Finance: After the government moved westward, the economic development of the Southwest cannot be delayed. In order to meet the needs of people in the interior, the major financial institutions in Shanghai have opened branches in important locations in various provinces in the Southwest, and the number has increased day by day. Many financial institutions in the war zone have also retreated to the Southwest with the government, and people's capital has gradually moved in to be used for local production enterprises. At present, Shanghai's capital lacks investment opportunities. If it can be transferred to the interior under safe principles, it will undoubtedly contribute to the economic development of the Southwest. All of the above are characteristics of wartime finance this year. Although it is not entirely satisfactory, if we understand the seriousness of this war and the vastness of its spread, we must regard the stability of the financial situation this year as a rare phenomenon. The government's efforts to protect the currency, ensure financial security, and maintain credit, as well as the cooperative assistance of friendly financial institutions, have all made great contributions.

### The Dr. Shang Zhongyi That I Know

— Zhuang Zexuan

Southern Guangdong is unfortunate, suffering cruel trampling. Educators who have left us have already been three in succession. Among the three, the death of Dr. Shang Zhongyi is the most sudden. However, among the three, my relationship with Shang is the deepest. Twenty years ago, when I went abroad, Shang was still studying at the Tsinghua Secondary Vocational School, and I did not know him. Fifteen years ago, when I returned to China to teach at Tsinghua, Shang was about to graduate. At that time, I also served as a career guidance officer. I knew that he was enthusiastic about social service and strongly urged him to study education. Shang also wanted to enter Peabody College for Teachers at Vanderbilt University. Peabody is a well-known normal college located in the southern United States, as famous as Columbia and Chicago. Previously, no Chinese students had gone there. After Shang entered, he received a warm welcome from the local people and teachers and students in the school. Later, Shang went to Columbia Teachers College and obtained a doctorate.

Six years ago, I went to Hangzhou to teach at Zhejiang University, while Shang was at the Zhejiang Changmiao People's Education Experimental School, training many teachers for the people. I met Mr. Meng Lin in Guling and learned that Peking University needed educational talents, so I sought Shang's consent. At that time, Shang had married Ms. Wang Lifang, a Tsinghua classmate and sister of Guijun, who specialized in music in the United States. The husband followed the wife in singing, which was extremely happy.

A year ago, when I fled to Guangdong due to the war, Shang was the acting director of the Education Research Institute of Zhongshan University, striving to promote wartime education. Before long, Mr. Zaiyang returned from overseas investigation. Brothers Zhu Youguang and Zeng Zhaosen hosted several banquets for Mr. Zaiyang at the Lingnan Reception Room, and Shang and I were both present. I remember that there was a tense debate on a certain issue. Later, General Wo Qi heard of Shang's name and invited him to join the Political Department. Shang worked diligently day and night, and was uncompromising in the face of danger. When Guangzhou was evacuated, Shang sent his family to Guilin so that he could concentrate on his work. Initially, I did not expect that Guangzhou would fall and Guilin would be bombed. Shang went north with the army, while Madam Shang and her children came to Hong Kong via an indirect route.

This time, Shang was planning to take a car from Shao through Shantou to Hong Kong, but the car encountered an unexpected disaster near Shunning. Everyone else was slightly injured, but Shang died in the line of duty. Alas, why does Heaven rob us of educators more than those in other professions? Shang was in the prime of his life. With more time, his contributions to education would not have been limited to what he had already accomplished. We are already familiar with Shang's contributions to wartime education. If his leadership is desired for postwar educational facilities but cannot be obtained, wouldn't that be a great loss to the future of the country and the nation!

### Encounter

— Sun Zhenshi

After a round of poisonous interrogation, he was taken by several burly men into this dark iron prison. It was so narrow and suffocating, crowded with a large group of people. As soon as he entered, he almost tripped over a foot that was sticking out. Feeling his way forward, he sat down in the gap between people. He felt his brain expanding desperately, and every pore on his skin was exploding. A burst of soreness, a burst of numbness, he clenched his teeth subconsciously; his eyes gradually blurred and darkened, the world seemed to be spinning, and finally, he fainted.

A burst of intense pain woke him up again. Looking around, it was still pitch black. Some voices were groaning softly. A vague shadow flashed through his mind, and he silently sank into his memories.

One noon, he was about to walk out of the office when Captain Wang Zhongwen rushed over and whispered to him:

"Jin Gang, there is another task for you now. If you succeed, we will be even stronger."

"What is it?" He looked at Captain Wang.

Captain Wang immediately put his mouth close to his ear:

"Although we now have hundreds of comrades, we only have thirty or forty firearms. Under the paving in front of the ×× Elementary School gate in Town C, there are more than fifty short guns buried. They were left behind when the army retreated before. Now we are sending you to find a way to transport them out. As for how to transport them, you will have to see how things go when you get there." Captain Wang raised his head, looked at the blue sky, and continued quickly: "You must go tonight, it's good that you are familiar with the situation in the town."

So, in the twilight, he arrived in Town C and lodged in the home of an acquaintance. He began his activities.

Two weeks later, he led a group of enthusiastic young porters and sneaked into the uninhabited school at night, starting a difficult job. The river water beside the paving was flashing with black light in the dark night. A fishing boat was quietly waiting, urging them to work harder.

Using the light of the moon and stars, they dug and dug in the dark night. The soil was dug up several feet high, and a wide wooden board was discovered. It was said that under this, a pile of dark guns were buried. Countless eyes began to reveal waves of joy and happiness, and they used all their strength to tie the guns together and move them to the fishing boat parked by the river. The partners waiting on the fishing boat loaded the guns onto the boat and covered them with cloth.

The fishing boat began to move in the river, reflecting in the light of the stars and moon. The outline of the town was dreaming in a sweet sleep.

The surroundings were silent, and a sound of oars came from across the river. Before long, several strong beams of light shone on the boat, and a violent voice shouted: "What are you doing? Don't move!" Before the partners could put up a fight, the other side jumped over to the boat. So Jin Gang and his partners were taken to the pseudo-police station in a series. Before the interrogation, they were beaten severely by the yellow-clothed men stationed in the pseudo-police station. Fresh red blood burst out of their red skin, turning into a brownish-purple narrow brand on their bodies. After the beating, they were taken one by one to the interrogation room. Several hideous yellow-clothed men and puppet officials were sitting high above, revealing contemptuous sneers.

"Aren't you going to confess?" The voice from above floated in the air. Jin Gang was still standing calmly and solemnly, silently pondering. After a while, the side door of the interrogation room was lightly pushed open, and a young man in plain clothes came out casually, and saw Jin Gang, pretending to be surprised!

"Oh, it's Brother Jin Gang! What crime have you committed?"

He looked up and standing in front of him was Yang Yimin, a former classmate.

"Brother Jin Gang, joined the guerrillas? Haha - what a boring thing -"

Countless sparks burst out in Jin Gang's eyes. Before Yang Yimin finished speaking, he rushed towards him in one breath, and Yang Yimin was caught off guard and somersaulted.

After that, Jin Gang was dragged down and beaten severely by several burly men, fainting and waking up, waking up and fainting again, fainting and waking up several times. His whole body was red and swollen. In this way, he was pushed into this iron prison.

He missed the young porters and boatmen, and also missed his many comrades. In this way, he endured in prison, suffering hardships, waiting for an opportunity to break through the wall and fly away.

### Dawn

— Ma Yufeng

Farmers are used to getting up early,

The sky is only slightly bright,

Someone is walking on the porch,

Followed by the sound of opening the door.

Mother starts a fire in the kitchen

And tells her younger sister,

To carry buckets to inspect the round fields,

The outdoors is hazy.

### Prisoner

— Shen Si

The waning moon hangs on the government, accompanying us all the way. When the sun rises, we have already traveled twenty miles.

The roadside is full of places passed by the × army. In the villages on the west bank of the Fen River, there is not a single person's shadow.

We can no longer see the smoke rising from the chimneys in the morning, and we feel a continuous desolation in our hearts.

Dogs wandered on the roadside, licking the blood on the ground. In the distance, we saw the highway winding down from the mountain. Our alert troops were all over our heads.

Clap! Clap! Clap! It rang continuously.

As we passed the highway, four enemies fixed on this side of the highway from the village next to the highway.

We greeted them, and the quick gun rang loudly, and a Japanese soldier fell down.

"Surrender your guns, don't kill, treat you well!" The propagandist shouted slogans in Japanese, and our ranks continued to move forward

The other three Japanese soldiers ran to the village in front. Our soldiers, who were chasing closely behind, also shouted in Japanese.

We are the Eighth Route Army, we treat prisoners well.

Three living Japanese soldiers were disarmed.

I asked them: "Why are you deceived by the fascist warlords and come to China to be cannon fodder?"

They lowered their heads for a long time and did not speak.

Suddenly one of them spoke, his voice a little excited.

"We are fighting for the peace of East Asia, not for aggression."

I asked again:

"Fighting for peace, why come to China to forcibly occupy Chinese land, kill Chinese people, rape Chinese women, ...

He said, "Because China cannot understand."

I was a little angry and asked:

"What do you want us to understand?"

"I don't know what the government of my country thinks."

The political officer told them our proposition. He said, "We do not hate the Japanese people, we only want to overthrow the Japanese fascist warlords; most Japanese people are suffering just like us. We - Chinese and Japanese, should unite to attack the fascist bandits and relieve our own suffering.

They expressed their approval of the political officer's talk

The political officer's attitude was so sincere and sincere that it could really move people

Later, he said to them again: "If you come to China, you will never be able to go back, and your parents and wives at home will be thinking of you every day: If you come to China, you will not benefit!"

"Even if my family thinks of me, they will want to die!"

Tears came from the eyes of the three foreigners.

A cannon shot from Nanguan was very violent; so our political officer led a battalion of people to the mountains on both sides of the highway between Guangjiugu and Taohuapo. Prepare to intercept the passing motorcade.

### The Solitary Walk

— Grass on the Wall

I have always enjoyed walking. When I say enjoy, it's not because I agree with hygiene enthusiasts that it's a beneficial physical and mental exercise. Actually, it's because I have too much free time; when I'm happy, I just wander around, and slowly it becomes a habit. When people develop a habit, they often do it unconsciously and automatically. For me, walking is a good example.

Most of my walks take place late at night, because during the day, there are too many vehicles on the street, and the crowds are relatively dense. As vehicles pass, they stir up dust, which goes straight into my nose, making it difficult to breathe. At night—or even at dusk—the soldiers and police are fewer, and the crowds are sparse. This allows me to walk freely without bumping into someone's shoulder, or having someone step on my shoes, which would make my leisurely mood anxious and violate the original purpose of walking.

I don't like walking with a large group of people, because the pleasure it offers is no longer based on walking. Even on a small scale, the different paces of each person can create a lot of trouble in the mind. However, I do enjoy walking with two people, as long as the other person truly understands the pleasure of walking. But, in reality, I am often alone, just me by myself.

Therefore, I laugh at myself as a solitary walker.

Because I have walked so much, I am familiar with so many streets suitable for walking, most of which are relatively quiet but not deserted. I walk slowly on them, always muttering something like a masterpiece of a poem. In fact, I often don't think about anything. I pay no attention to the things around me; or I feel something, I perceive something. I think I belong to another world, and at the same time, I think that world belongs exclusively to me. But when I realize that my body is actually in the human world, in the ordinary hustle and bustle, I have overlooked things? I calmly want to emphasize my observation to discover the fun in them. I will stop under dazzling neon lights, moving my gaze and silently enjoying the colors and structural beauty of various goods. I will follow behind graceful women to satisfy my sensory comfort. Yes, I also feel such loneliness, so I often urgently want to meet an acquaintance. Even if it's someone I've only met briefly, I'll greet them, cast a joyful glance, and of course, I need a sincere handshake and a heart-to-heart conversation, which will warm my soul.

But the streets are like the ocean, and in the vast ocean, I am unfamiliar with the crowds.

The night is deep, and people have already gone to sleep. On this street, there is only me.

I look at the stars in the sky. I think with a sense of gain and loss, like a philosopher trying to understand the secrets of the universe.

Friend, do you want to ask me what I'm thinking about?

I tell you, I miss the suburbs. How wonderful it would be to take a solitary walk in the suburbs. I want to go to the suburbs.

### Snow on the Ground

— Shu Qun

As soon as the maid saw him, she immediately closed her mouth and shivered: she was like a lit candle, gradually melting away. She didn't dare to speak, only giving the detective some hints, as if to say:

"That guy, he's the bandit!"

So, the detective immediately pulled out his gun and watched Yu Wen. At this time, the maid slowly hugged Zhu Lin and dared to speak:

"Can't you see it's him?"

Zhu Lin was smart. She said:

"Are you crazy? Didn't he just come with me? Didn't you see him?"

"I saw him! But I just recognized him now! Miss, I remember his eyes, don't you think they're strange?"

"Don't talk nonsense!"

"Miss, who is he?"

"He's my friend!"

The detective's gun was quietly put away again. The maid was bored and lowered her head. In order to avoid the detective's and the maid's suspicion, Zhu Lin deliberately took Yu Wen's arm to show that this person was not to be violated because:

"He's my lover!" However, from the time they met until now, she didn't love him, just as he didn't love her. What he and she loved was the same third party—the country.

The snow has been falling for three days. This heavy snow is common, because it is the snow of Manchuria.

After this parting, she returned to her family and soon moved to a new address; he was soon transferred to another job and went to another place. Because of the changes on both sides, it was impossible to find out their addresses. For five years, all news was cut off. However, in these five years, they often asked their comrades, their friends:

"Do you know Zhu Lin?" and "Do you know Yu Wen?" (The End)
