### European War Clouds and Soviet-Japanese Conflict

These past few days, the international situation has been extremely urgent. The three most sensational events that have shocked the world are: first, the war clouds in Europe are thickening again; second, the Soviet-Japanese conflict is intensifying; and third, Japan's threats and blackmail against Britain, France, and the United States. Except for the third event, which has been repeatedly commented on by this newspaper and does not require further elaboration, we would like to briefly express our views on the first and second events to our compatriots from all walks of life and friendly countries.

First, regarding the war clouds in Europe, since the Munich Conference, although some blind and stubborn commentators have praised the "xxx compromise policy" for its contribution to world peace, we not only cannot agree with this view, but have also earnestly pointed out that the fascist aggressors are greedy and insatiable. Any compromise or concession policy will not only fail to achieve peace and stability, but will inevitably encourage the arrogance of the "xxx people" and increase the risk of a world war. Recently, the British and French governments recognized the Spanish rebel regime, and we must point out its assistance to the fascist aggressors and the harm it causes to world justice and peace. We must point out that the fascist invasion of Britain, the United States, and France to redivide the world has developed to a more serious stage. The current development of events is generally as expected. Today's newspapers quoted a Reuters dispatch from London as saying: "While various circles in Europe still largely maintain an optimistic attitude towards the European situation, there is reliable news confirming the movement of Italian troops near Italy, Libya, and Djibouti, as well as the secret dispatch of mysterious troops within Germany, which seems to coincide with Hodson's previous speech in Olympia, which is quite shocking." Another report stated: "France and Italy are both actively preparing their border defenses in Tunisia and Libya. French journalist Baudinet stated in a speech at the Anglo-French Association that Britain and France must cooperate in the Red Sea to prevent the outbreak of war in Europe, as Italy is now preparing to launch a war in Africa. If it arbitrarily achieves a partial victory in the Red Sea region, Britain and France will inevitably be forced to declare war. Regarding Germany's intentions, rumors abound. According to general observations, it is widely believed that Germany seems to be using the demand for its old colonies as an exchange condition to prevent war, but Germany is currently mobilizing its troops on a large scale, which has caused great anxiety among various governments." The two major fascist aggressors, Germany and Italy, are already preparing to launch even more shocking and dangerous actions under the compromise policies of Britain and France to provoke war, threaten democratic and peaceful countries, and redivide the world. This is an undisguised secret.

Second, the Soviet-Japanese conflict is not news in itself, but at a time when Western aggressors are intensifying the crisis of a major war, it is more noteworthy that Japanese aggressors are vigorously launching provocations against the Soviet Union. According to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 4th, "Well-informed sources mostly believe that the Soviet-Japanese fishing agreement dispute is more likely to cause war than the European situation, and Japan's dispatch of a military delegation to visit the Axis powers seems to be directly related to this danger." The dispatch also stated, "If Germany's attitude towards the anti-German movement in Poland is so peaceful, then the Libyan and Tunisian border issues and the Soviet Russian Far East fishing ground disputes must be given more attention." This shows the international attitude towards the Soviet-Japanese conflict. According to a Reuters dispatch from Changchun on the 4th, "This morning, Soviet and puppet troops again engaged in battle on the border north of Manzhouli. It is reported that the situation on the Soviet and puppet border is more tense than before." We should have at least the following basic understandings of this event: first, Japan not only does not have the strength to attack the Soviet Union and win today, but also does not have the determination to launch a real anti-Soviet war, as can be proven by its surrender to the Soviet Union in the Zhanggufeng Incident. Second, today's Soviet-Japanese disputes are entirely based on the Japanese rulers' strengthening of their collusion with Germany and Italy, threatening and enticing the democratic powers in order to achieve their ambition of dominating the Pacific. Third, Japan has recently been constantly using the Soviet-Japanese dispute to conceal its defeats in the invasion of China and to alleviate anti-war sentiment at home and in the military. Fortunately, the Soviet authorities have constantly and ruthlessly exposed the conspiracies of the Japanese aggressors. After the Zhanggufeng Incident, they have repeatedly struck back at the provocations of the Japanese and puppet troops. Now, the entire Soviet Union is united in preparing to repel any aggressor's attack, and its national defense strength and international prestige are also increasing day by day. Therefore, the result of Japan's provocations against the Soviet Union will not be the Soviet Union that is threatened and harmed, but the Japanese aggressors themselves!

Regardless of whether it is the war clouds in Europe or the Soviet-Japanese conflict, we can draw the following conclusions by analyzing their basic causes and development status: (1) Under the continued implementation of the British and French compromise policies, international fascist aggressors will become even more rampant, and the Second World War, in which they invade Britain, the United States, and France to redivide the colonies, has reached a more serious stage; (2) The Eastern aggressor, Japan, has already taken advantage of this new situation, using a bluffing anti-Soviet war to support Italy and Germany's dangerous actions in Europe and Africa, while also vying for the interests of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands in the Pacific; (3) In this new and serious stage, democratic and peaceful countries, especially Britain and France, have reached a crossroads. A small number of rulers representing financial capitalists are still continuing to lead the country to the path of danger through compromise policies, while the broad masses are launching a struggle against compromise and against fascism under the leadership of revolutionary parties and progressive people; (4) The prestige of the Soviet Union's peace policy has greatly increased internationally, especially after the Zhanggufeng Incident and the recent repeated expressions of opposition to fascist aggression and support for democratic and peaceful forces. Even Poland, which has always been close to Germany, has recognized this point and changed its attitude, and the British government, under the lessons of this fact and the calls of the domestic masses, has had to reconsider the adjustment of British-Soviet relations.

Based on the above conclusions, we can more clearly understand the path of struggle to save the current crisis: first, we understand the nature of today's world war, which is a war in which fascist aggressors attack democratic and peaceful countries to redivide the world. The main targets of attack are colonies and semi-colonies, and the countries that own all rights and interests in colonies and semi-colonies, such as Britain, the United States, and France. Therefore, whether in Europe, Africa, or the Pacific, the democratic and peaceful countries of Britain, the United States, and France should quickly unite further. Second, the new world war launched by fascism will harm colonies, semi-colonies, and all small and weak nations, and will sacrifice the oppressed masses of the world. Therefore, all small and weak nations and the oppressed masses should unite to establish a united front to resist fascism and resist aggressive war; third, the governments and people of China and Spain have resolutely expressed their continued struggle with the fascist aggressors for national liberation and the maintenance of world peace and democracy. The governments and people of all democratic and peaceful countries, all oppressed nations, and the working masses should unite to effectively support China and Spain in continuing the war of resistance; fourth, the new major war crisis being promoted by fascism is clearly contrary to the Soviet Union's peace policy and policy of national independence and liberation, and at the same time, it is contrary to the interests of the Soviet Union and the working masses of the world. Therefore, the Soviet Union has been and is more actively leading the struggle of the united front against fascism and against aggression. This struggle should obviously and must receive the warm support of all democratic and peaceful countries and all people who love justice and freedom. The new dangerous plans of the fascist aggressors have already begun in the Far East and will soon begin in Europe. All democratic and peaceful countries, all small and weak nations, and all oppressed masses, all proletarian and working masses, should unite under the banner of anti-fascism and anti-aggression, and fight for eternal justice and freedom!

### Overseas Chinese in Annam

â€” Yuan Yun

The Scenery of Annam and the Overseas Chinese. When Annam is mentioned, people will think of the story of the victory in the Battle of Lang Son, followed by seeking peace and ceding territory. However, it is hard to imagine that today, this place of national historical shame has become the artery of international transportation for the long-term war of resistance. From Haiphong through Dong Dang to Longzhou, and from Haiphong through Hanoi to Hekou, are shortcuts to the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Guangxi. Therefore, the warring country at that time was not Italy or Germany, but France, which can be considered a stroke of luck in misfortune.

The first impression of Annam that makes people feel good is their municipal administration, especially Hanoi. The straight asphalt roads, the straight green trees on both sides, the straight rows of streetlights in the middle, and the pedestrian paths on the left and right, which are about half the width of the roads, plus the interspersed green lawns and the light gray and light yellow Western-style buildings, truly make you feel like you are in a garden, without feeling the noise of the city. If you walk out of Bulevard Road at dusk, stroll around Sword Lake, listen quietly to the scarlet music flying over from the opposite lake, and look at the rainbow-shaped red palace-style cafe under the lights and clouds, with a gentle breeze carrying bursts of ancient temple bells, you are guaranteed to have the feeling of being in Zhongnanhai or Summer Palace's Kunming Lake in Beijing. This kind of leisurely and tranquil scene does not have a strong coppery smell, nor does it have a completely Western color, but rather contains the life attitude of Chinese style, a harmonious beauty of artificial and natural.

In Annam, the second impression is the Annamese people. In my impression, the Annamese are inseparable from betel nuts. In Lang Son, Dong Dang, and Haiphong, many Annamese people have a row of black teeth, chewing betel nuts non-stop, spitting out mouthfuls of blood. Women all open their chests and tie cloth belts, while men wear half-length black long shirts. Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã— Once you get to Hanoi, the situation is very different. Annamese men in leather shoes and suits, and Annamese women in silk clothes and white pants, have an elegant look that is no less than that of modern Chinese ladies. The physique of the Annamese is not strong, and women are especially weak and overwhelmed. Plus their charming dress, with a bunch of soft hair draped behind their heads, wearing tight gauze on the upper body and white silk pants on the lower body, with a pair of open-toed slippers tied on their feet, walking along, suddenly, completely conforms to the demeanor of ladies in ancient Chinese paintings. No wonder Chinese people come here to cheer loudly and voluntarily assimilate with the Annamese.

In Annam, the third impression is the overseas Chinese. When we enter Annam, we don't understand the language or the roads, so we can travel freely everywhere entirely thanks to the guidance of the overseas Chinese. On the road, when we see shops with the signs of "Guang" or "Fu," they are shops opened by Cantonese or Fujianese people. Based on this principle, buying things and asking for directions is foolproof. In Hanoi, the Railway Station Street, Guangdong Street, and Fujian Street are the commercial centers of the overseas Chinese. In Haiphong, Chinatown and Tokyo Street are also gathering places for overseas compatriots. When overseas compatriots meet, they don't ask about the weather or the market, but mostly about the news of the war of resistance. Their concern for national affairs is evident.

Among the overseas Chinese in Annam, Cantonese people are the most numerous, followed by Fujianese, and then Guangxi and Zhejiang people. All the businesses and public institutions of the overseas Chinese are in the hands of the Cantonese. In Hanoi, Haiphong, and Nam Dinh, only the Cantonese and Fujianese gangs can cooperate harmoniously and jointly promote public welfare. In the Saigon area, there are separate gangs just for the Cantonese, such as the Guangfu, Siyi, Chaozhou, Dongguan Nanlu, and Hakka, and the spirit of cooperation is far inferior to that of Hanoi and Haiphong. The gang leader system has a long history. The gang leader serves a term of two or three years. The qualifications for gang leader must be that of a local overseas Chinese who is wealthy, enthusiastic about public welfare, generous in donations among the overseas Chinese, and has both virtue and seniority. In some places, the gang leader is elected by the overseas Chinese and then recognized by the local government. In some places, the government predetermines several gang leaders and then hands them over to the overseas Chinese for election. The latter situation is extremely rare. The only task of the gang leader is to collect taxes for the French government. The personal tax of the overseas Chinese (16.5 yuan per year) and the business license tax of each shop are collected by the gang leader and handed over to the Vietnamese authorities. The right to elect and be elected as gang leader by overseas Chinese is limited to shops that have a business license. Each shop has only one vote. The election takes place at the city hall. In previous years, there have been no incidents of bribery or uproar in the elections. The person who becomes a gang leader can be exempted from their own business license tax and the personal tax of all family members. In addition, the Vietnamese government also provides a salary of about 1,000 to 2,000 yuan per year, which is drawn from the tax revenue of the overseas Chinese. However, those who become gang leaders are all wealthy households who are not interested in money, so the salary is mostly donated to public welfare undertakings, or to support schools or hospitals, or to donate to guild charities. The overseas Chinese value face the most, and being a gang leader is the most prestigious, so wealthy people are willing to resign after serving one term as gang leader. To be a gang leader, one must be able to spend money and manage the affairs of the neighborhood. A good gang leader is often the one who donates the most money and is the most willing to do good. Mr. Huang Lizhou, the former Cantonese gang leader in Haiphong, and Mr. Luo Weiji, the current gang leader, are both patriotic figures and have good relationships. It is said that in Saigon, there are too many separate gangs, and some clear-headed people have realized the disadvantages of the overseas Chinese dividing into gangs and are carrying out a gang merger movement, but it is hindered by the French and Vietnamese authorities, who believe that this traditional habit does not need to be changed to avoid complications. In the eyes of the rulers, the more divided the organization of overseas Chinese, the better. This "unity" request is something they greatly disapprove of.

In Hanoi, there are about one or two hundred Fujianese overseas Chinese who, because they have lived in Annam for generations, their wives and relatives are all Annamese people. Their children also wear Annamese clothes. They do not admit that they are Fujianese, but form their own organization called the Mengxiang Association, which is between the Fujianese and the Annamese to show the difference. The license and personal taxes they pay are based on the Annamese method, which is more than half less than what the overseas Chinese pay each year. Their children attend Annamese schools, and their families and living habits cannot find any Chinese style. However, the Fujian Guild Hall in Hanoi was originally initiated and built by them. To this day, their relationship with the Guild Hall is only to come to burn incense and worship on major holidays. This kind of forgetfulness of one's roots is worthy of our concern. Fortunately, only a very small number of people do this. Overseas Chinese... it can be said that they are everywhere, and yet they are nowhere to be found.

Intermarriage between overseas Chinese and Annamese is not very popular, probably more common among Fujianese. Cantonese people must return to their homeland once when they grow up, get married, and then come out again. The personal tax for women, children, the elderly, and the weak here is extremely low, only a little over one yuan per year, so it is not a burden on the family. Overseas compatriots do not value Annamese people very much, which is probably due to traditional reasons. However, in fact, Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—, they urinate everywhere, spit betel nut juice all over the ground, are fond of eating and lazy, and are weak and afraid of things, as if they were born to be ruled. Once, when I visited the Hanoi Exposition, I saw a pair of gold-lettered couplets in the main hall. The first line said,

"Even if there is accomplishment, why bother climbing high mountains and looking at the distant sea?" The second line said,

"If the government has nothing to do, why not drink wine and get close to women?" The sound of national demise is vividly written on paper. Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã— Fooling the people policy can be regarded as reaching its peak.

The recreational life of the overseas Chinese in Annam..., the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Haiphong has a Party Department reading room, with only a few Datang newspapers. The newspapers they read are always news from four or five days ago. Saigon has a Chinese newspaper, but its management is not improving. Some overseas Chinese in Haiphong have recently planned to run a newspaper, but because the import of machinery and tariffs are too high, it has not yet materialized. The organization of the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce is currently under preparation. It is said that it will be established soon. This is also a major event worthy of reporting for the overseas Chinese in Annam!

### A Memorial Meeting of Blood and Tears

â€” (Special Dispatch from Dijiang) Lin Heng

"Comrades," Mr. Chen, who was also the most moved, began to speak in a firm tone. "Look, one side of the sun is covered by dark clouds. This symbolizes the death of the Japanese invaders is coming soon. The other side symbolizes that China has a bright future. Victory in the war of resistance is right in front of us. Comrades, laugh! Laugh!" Mr. Chen made a gesture of appeal with his hand, and he himself gave a wry smile. Some people followed him and cried, but the sound was very small. But some people seemed not to have heard Mr. Chen's words and were still silent. Mr. He's line of sight was focused on the fortress opposite him for a long time without moving. Mr. Ma lowered his head. Mr. Tan did not know when he started to focus his sight into his steel helmet. Comrades Liang, Wang, and Yan were still crying non-stop, secretly wiping their hot tears with white handkerchiefs. Comrade Liang looked at the handkerchief after wiping away her tears and suddenly hid it in frustration, as if saying in her heart, "I want to keep this tear stain as a souvenir."

"To commemorate 'January 28,' we must examine the current world situation, the situation in China, the situation in Dongjiang, and the serious crises that exist now. Does our own organization have any crises? What are the shortcomings...? We should bravely admit our weaknesses and overcome them... To commemorate 'January 28,' our task is to persist in a protracted war and set up guerrilla bases in Dongjiang... To commemorate 'January 28,' I hope that all comrades will work hard to overcome their own weaknesses... To commemorate 'January 28,' I call on comrades to have a general review meeting tomorrow, thoroughly reviewing the past work and style, and use the general review meeting to commemorate today's memorial meeting."

"Support!" A group of young people shouted this slogan in unison.

4.  On the Way Home

"Blood! Blood! Blood taught everything! Never forget today's memorial meeting of blood and tears! Use the general review meeting to commemorate today's memorial service! To commemorate 'January 28,' we must swear to avenge the warriors and fight for national liberation..."

"Arise, you who refuse to be slaves..." After shouting the slogans and singing the March of the Volunteers, this group of young people walked down Feie Ridge step by step. The singing was worse than usual. After singing weakly, there was another silence. After a long time, Mr. Gao told everyone, "Honestly, I have never been so moved in my life as I am today!" Then many people nodded in agreement. Then Mr. Han said, "We must convey this memorial meeting of blood and tears to the General Headquarters, to all comrades, to all compatriots, and to the people of the world! We must write it into a newsletter so that all readers will cry as sadly and indignantly as we do..."

Still few people spoke, completely different from the situation when they set out. With a sad and indignant mood, they slowly stepped into the Kangxian Huiyang County team headquarters.

In Huizhou City, three days after "January 28."

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Instructions at the National Education Conference

Our first National Education Conference was convened in May of the 17th year of the Republic of China, and the second National Education Conference was convened in April of the 19th year of the Republic of China. This is the third National Education Conference, more than eight years since the previous conference. The conference is being held at a time when our entire nation is actively engaged in the War of Resistance and nation-building, so its mission is particularly important. The task of this education conference is, of course, to review the current situation in the education sector, study methods of improvement or remedy, and resolve various difficult problems currently facing education. But what I ask of all of you present is that you further confirm the needs of the Republic of China at this time, grasp the central issues in education, and take on the responsibility of saving and building the nation with full enthusiasm and sincerity. That is to say, we must recognize a definite goal in education, and take the Three Principles of the People, which saves the nation through revolution, as the highest standard of our nation's education, implement the outline of the War of Resistance and nation-building, and create a new life for the modern nation. I often say, "The vitality of a modern nation is composed of three elements: education, economy, and military force. Education is the foundation of all undertakings, and it can also be said that education is the general hub connecting the economy and military force. Therefore, we must take developing the economy and strengthening the military force as the direction of our education." Especially during this period of the War of Resistance and nation-building, we must develop the economy to enrich the national strength during the war and lay the foundation for nation-building after the war, and we must also strengthen the military force in order to win victories on the one hand and build the nation and the people on the other. We must create a modern nation with vitality and a promising future for our China from the midst of various hardships and difficulties during the war.

Currently, the most hotly debated issue in education is the issue of wartime education and normal education. That is to say, should we break down all formal education systems, or maintain the normal education system while incorporating methods for extraordinary times? Regarding this issue, my personal opinion is that the solution is very simple. I have often said in the past few years, "In peacetime, we must treat it as wartime, and in wartime, we must treat it as peacetime." I also said, "Wartime life is modern life. In the present era, whether individuals or society, if they do not practice wartime life, they cannot exist and will be eliminated and destroyed." If we understand this meaning, we do not need to have the debate between normal education and wartime education. It is because we could not treat peacetime as wartime in the past that many people cannot treat wartime as peacetime now. These two mistakes are inherently related. We can never say that all education can be isolated from the world, outside of the needs of the nation, close its doors, and ignore the external environment, even when foreign enemies are pressing in. We can still maintain the status quo and not become tense at all. But we also cannot say that because it is wartime, all academic systems, courses, and education laws can be put aside. Because it is wartime, we unconditionally drive all young people in school out of classrooms, laboratories, and research rooms, send them to another situation, and do emergency work without choice or purpose. We need soldiers, and when necessary, we may even have to mobilize professors or university students. We need various cadres for the War of Resistance, and we cannot but organize training for various emergency talents outside the usual education system. But at the same time, we also need profound technical talents in all fields and various types, and we need scholars with specialized research. Moreover, especially during the War of Resistance, we need to focus on expanding various basic educations. In order to adapt to the needs of the War of Resistance and conform to the wartime environment, we should use the methods of extraordinary times to achieve the original purpose of education, and use an extraordinary spirit to expand the effect of education. This is what we should do. For example, our schools at all levels should strive for frugality in equipment, simplicity in living, and hard work during the war. We see that the ancients taught their sons by drawing in the ashes, using such simple

### Fierce Battles East of the Xiang River: We Recapture Jiukou but Suffer Heavy Losses; Northern Section of the Yuehan Railway Remains Under Our Control

[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 5 PM, 5th] Jingmen Telegram: In Central Hubei, the enemy is now using three mixed brigades to launch a full-scale offensive against our Jingshan-Zhongxiang road. The intensity of the battle is unprecedented since the second phase of the War of Resistance. We are engaging them in full force east of the Xiang River. The enemy is using aircraft, artillery, and poison gas in a combined assault on Sunqiao and Guanqiao. We are also fighting desperately with all our might. After nine days and nights of bloody battle, our total casualties have reached five to six thousand, a one-to-one ratio, setting a new record since the War of Resistance. The enemy has suffered repeated heavy blows but continues to increase their forces, intending to eliminate our army on the Xiang River. We are continuing our efforts, fighting to the death in a bloody battle.

[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 5 PM, 5th] Jingdou Telegram: The situation on the highway east of the Xiang River is still stable. The enemy suddenly increased forces and detoured near Dongqiao and Jiukou, engaging in fierce fighting. One of our units advanced eastward from a certain location, and reinforcements were added in a certain area nearby. A certain famous general of ours is now commanding in a certain area in the front, and strictly ordered all units not to cross the river to the west without authorization. The morale is high, with each soldier capable of fighting like a hundred. It is expected that the great victory of the Battle of Linyi will reappear today.

[Central News Agency, Yichang, 5th] The enemy who invaded western Hubei along the west side of the Xiang River was ambushed by us yesterday near Jiukou, suffering heavy casualties. However, due to the enemy's use of poison gas, many of our officers and soldiers were poisoned, and we were forced to shift our positions. Jiukou then fell into enemy hands. Subsequently, after our army reinforced and counterattacked, we successfully recaptured it that evening.

[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 4th] (Delayed) Jingdou Telegram: The enemy forces invading Central Hubei along the Hanyi Road have increased to 7,000, with more than ten artillery pieces and more than ten tanks. They were attacked from the side by one of our brigades north of the highway and shifted their attack to a certain army position in Yangjiahe. Part of the force then detoured from Xia Yanggang and Hejiaji, via Fujiatai, launching a fierce attack, attempting to expand the war and break our main force, not hesitating to use aircraft and artillery to bombard us heavily, and advancing dangerously. An unprecedented bloody battle for control has unfolded in the past two days. Our positions were repeatedly in danger, but our officers and soldiers resisted desperately, falling one after another, engaging in hand-to-hand combat, and finally turned the situation around. As of the 4th, they were still fighting fiercely. The enemy's casualties were double ours. Their wounded were all transported from Wamiaoji to Zaoshi. A certain company of a certain regiment of our left wing attacked the enemy's command post in Yiheji, killing over a hundred enemy soldiers and capturing many light machine guns, rifles, and military supplies. One of our regiments attacked the enemy at Liujiaji, destroying eight armored vehicles and killing over a hundred enemy soldiers. We are concentrating our main forces to continue our flanking attack on the enemy.

[Central News Agency, Miluo, 5th] The enemy in the northern section of the Yuehan Railway, after suffering repeated attacks on Yanglousi and Yangloudong by us, is now stationing a considerable force in those two locations to defend against our further attacks. According to reports, in addition to a certain enemy division's detachment stationed in the area, there is also an enemy brigade headquarters and 1,600 infantrymen. In addition, there are more than ten enemy military warehouses scattered throughout the area. Also, there are still five to six hundred enemy soldiers in Taolin. The enemy at Xitang has built a military bridge at Yougang. The enemy situation in Matang, Yueyang, and other locations remains unchanged.

[Central News Agency, Pingjiang, 4th] Yesterday, there were no changes on the front line. Our guerrillas behind enemy lines have been taking advantage of the rainy season in recent days, constantly attacking the enemy between Tongcheng and Chongyang. Contact occurs almost daily, and each battle yields considerable gains. The enemy's movements in Tongcheng and Chongyang are entirely under our control.

[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 5th] The enemy troops in Changxing City have now increased to about 700, showing signs of attempting to invade westward.

We Destroy the Datong-Puzhou Railway

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 5th] Before dawn on the 2nd, one of our units destroyed about two li of the Datong-Puzhou Railway at Dacun, north of Anyi. They removed many telegraph wires and railroad spikes and buried landmines nearby. When a column of enemy guard troops passed by, they triggered the landmines, killing more than ten people. Over a hundred enemy soldiers from Zhangdian heard the explosion and rushed to attack us. Our army fought the enemy for three hours, killing and wounding more than ten enemy soldiers, and then retreated.

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 2nd] At 5 PM on the 3rd, an enemy force of about 100 people took advantage of the dense fog and advanced on our Wenjiazhuang defense line. They were fiercely attacked by one of our units, suffering more than ten casualties and were forced to flee. We only had one soldier wounded.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 4th] On the evening of the 28th of last month, a certain detachment of our army attacked the puppet troops of Duyang in Shangqiu, completely annihilating them. They seized more than 20 rifles, one Mauser pistol, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, two Rising Sun flags, more than ten documents, two artillery shells, dozens of bottles of Western medicine, five gas masks, more than 20 mules and horses, and captured more than 20 prisoners.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 4th] On the 2nd, a certain unit of our army ambushed the enemy invading westward in Yizhuang Village, Hejian. After a day of fierce fighting, they completely defeated the enemy, killing and wounding over a hundred enemy soldiers and leaving over thirty corpses. We seized one light machine gun, one heavy machine gun, more than 20 rifles, one grenade launcher, more than ten cases of rifle ammunition, and a portion of other military supplies.

[Central News Agency, Hequ, 3rd] The enemy in Ningwu has increased by over 1,000. On the 1st, they launched a fierce attack on our positions at Fenshuiling in the southwest of the county and at Dongzhai, supported by four aircraft. The battle was extremely fierce. As of the evening of the 2nd, the situation at Dongzhai was unclear.

[Central News Agency, Si'an, 4th] Wounded soldiers and corpses of Japanese soldiers being transported from southern Shanxi to Shijiazhuang are quite common these days. Electrically controlled landmines have been installed in the suburbs of Taiyuan City to prevent our army from attacking. This shows that our army's guerrilla warfare has been successful. The Yamagane Brigade, numbering approximately 2,000 men, is currently entrenched in Taiyuan City and strictly prohibits merchants from transporting goods and doing business, making it impossible for them to operate.

### Popular Resistance on Hainan Island; Enemy Planes Bomb Haikang

[Central News Agency, Xuwen, 5th] (1) The enemy occupying Qiongzhou Island has recently been harassing everywhere, robbing, killing, and committing all sorts of atrocities.

They also killed over seventy enemy soldiers on the Xiazi Road in western Qiongzhou. The enemy is extremely panicked. (2) The enemy is carrying out large-scale activities in the occupied areas, entering people's homes at night. The local people are now often disguised as women, taking the opportunity to kill the enemy. As a result, many have been killed.

[Central News Agency, Xuwen, 4th] At 9:50 AM on the 4th, four enemy planes dropped five bombs over Haikang City. One hit Tongren Hospital, killing an old doctor. One hit a civilian house, destroying it. The rest landed in wasteland.

### Puppet Troops in Tianjin Rebel, Engage in Fierce Battle with the Enemy

### National Education Conference: Speech by Chairman Chiang

(Continued from page 2)

Even with simple teaching tools, outstanding individuals can be cultivated, just as diligent study can be pursued even in poverty. This is what our teachers and students in wartime should emulate. Regarding student training, the expansion of subjects, the reduction of unnecessary courses in social education, and the maximum utilization of school resources and personnel, these problems can be solved by generalization and cannot be exhaustively enumerated.

In conclusion, we must not forget to treat wartime as peacetime, and we must not forget the fundamentals for the sake of expediency. This war is not only about fighting for national survival but also about transforming our people and revitalizing our country during this period. Therefore, our educational focus should not only be on wartime but also on the post-war era. We must estimate what level our national knowledge and abilities should be raised to if our country is to become a modern nation. If we want to build our country into a modern nation, we need tens of thousands of specialists, hundreds of thousands or even millions of technicians and engineers in various sectors, and even more millions of teachers and cadres to train the people. These must all be provided by our education community, and these problems must all be solved by our education community. I do not have time to discuss all the specific details of education. I hope you will focus on the most fundamental point, which is to strengthen our national will to resist the war and establish our spirit of nation-building, and especially to constantly improve our inherent national morality. Everyone knows that our country, with all its material deficiencies, is in such a dangerous and difficult period and still has to shoulder such extremely heavy responsibilities. If we do not overcome material difficulties with spirit, we will not be able to achieve victory in the War of Resistance. If we do not utilize our inherent morality and revolutionary spirit, and if we do not generate strength and create material wealth from this spirit, we will not be able to achieve success in nation-building. Moreover, what the Japanese are now trying by all means is to attack our spirit, overwhelm our spirit, and eliminate our nation's inherent morality and revolutionary spirit, so that our national life has no foundation. Therefore, the most urgent need at present is to revitalize and concentrate our spirit. Recently, the Central Government proposed and the National Political Council decided to implement a general mobilization of spirit, with the aim of strengthening our national spirit to shoulder the historical mission of resisting the war and building the nation. Methods will be determined soon and promoted nationwide. We hope that all educators across the country will resolutely take on this important responsibility and lead by example to advocate for all sectors and universally implement it. As the ancients said, "To transform the people and create customs must be done through education." Every word and deed of educators will affect the social atmosphere. No revolutionary movement in recent decades has not been enthusiastically advocated by the education community and ultimately brought to fruition. Today, it is not just a question of reviving and reforming, but a question of survival or extinction. We must promote the inherent spiritual morality of our nation, arouse the independence and self-esteem of all our people, awaken the entire nation to the determination to sacrifice against the Japanese invaders who are invading and destroying us, and establish a deep sense of self-confidence in the revolutionary future and the nation's future. Then, we can encourage the determination to move forward, make progress, and struggle actively. Only then will this vast and ancient nation be able to give birth to a bright and brilliant new life from thousands of hardships. I believe that for our country today, the lives of all educators should no longer be the leisurely life of teaching behind closed doors. Educators should not simply follow the curriculum, transmit knowledge, and treat it as a personal livelihood or private profession. Today's educators should see themselves as frontline warriors who break through enemy lines, as social mentors who change customs, as pioneers who blaze new trails, and as sages and heroes who continue what is broken and preserve what is lost.

Today, we can no longer agree with the long-misunderstood slogan of educational independence, which makes educators an isolated group who only adhere to national laws and the responsibilities given to them by the state. I believe that when we talk about education today, we should integrate education with military affairs, politics, society, economics, and all other undertakings. How can we integrate education with military affairs? We must create in all students a sense of national defense, self-defense, and the ability to govern themselves and the country. Students who are not of age should be able to serve the country's military when they grow up. Students of age should be able to enlist in the army when the country needs them. When not conscripted, each person should have a skill that can be used for war-related work. How can we say that education is integrated with politics? The Book of Rites says, "To be a teacher is to be a leader." In ancient times, teachers were the source of political cadres at all levels. Today, our educators should also take on the responsibility of training and organizing the people. How can we say that education is integrated with society? Recently, I have often heard that school educators regard running social education as a burden. I believe that while the budget, time, and energy must be considered appropriately, fundamentally speaking, school education cannot be separated from society. The ancients said, "Learn from each other to make up for shortcomings." We cannot bear to ignore the suffering of our fellow countrymen in society. In order to achieve the purpose of education, and to prevent being influenced by bad elements, we should also develop the general knowledge of the people in society to improve the school environment. How can we say that education is integrated with economics? This is even more a key point in our nation-building plan. We must teach the people according to the needs of national economic construction, emphasizing labor, productivity, and especially encouraging the ability to create. All educational plans must be coordinated with economic plans, so that our educational function can become a factor in creating the vitality of a modern nation.

### Enemy and Puppet Authorities in Beiping Conduct Extensive Searches

Anti-Traitor Elements Are Quite Active; The Puppet Government's Gang of Cronies Is Extremely Panicked

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, Sichuan, News] Beiping External News: The Japanese constabulary and Chinese police are continuing to conduct strict searches in city markets, theaters, brothels, streets, and city gates. The Chinese side said that the main reason for the authorities' intensified precautions was to prevent a "terrorist element" hiding in Tianjin from coming to Beiping to carry out activities. It is known that two uninvited guests went to the residence of a certain Chinese editor of the Butoku Shinbun, a mouthpiece of the Japanese military, on a certain day. The editor happened to be out, and the people told his family that they were from Tianjin and would threaten the editor's life. It is also rumored that someone attempted to assassinate a senior official of the "Provisional Government" here two days ago. It is also said that eight terrorists went to the "Provisional Government" office late at night and fired at the guards before fleeing. Although these three incidents have not yet been verified, all parties said that they did happen.

### Second Phase of War of Resistance Propaganda Week Begins Today; Nationwide Intensification of Propaganda Work; Ministers and Officials of Various Departments Will Broadcast Speeches

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] The period from the July 7th Incident to the fall of Yuezhou was the first phase of the War of Resistance, and the period after that is the second phase. In the first phase, the Japanese army's conspiracy to force us into submission without a fight and to quickly resolve the war was broken by us. Now, in the second phase, the military has turned to mountainous areas far from transportation lines. The Japanese army has lost its geographical advantage, while we have gained it. Furthermore, with various chaotic situations within the Japanese army, the Japanese army is in a dilemma. In order to try to save the decline, the Japanese army put forward the so-called outrageous slogan of establishing a new order in East Asia, attempting to quickly make peace and let us be their puppets forever. In order to expose the Japanese army's conspiracy, we have organized the first propaganda week of the second phase of the War of Resistance from March 6th to 12th, based on the main points of the President's rebuttal of the ridiculous statement and the opening speech of the Fifth Plenary Session. The methods are as follows: (1) Propaganda meetings will be held in all parts of the country during the propaganda week; (2) Special broadcast speeches will be held; (3) Special issues will be published in various newspapers and periodicals; (4) Propaganda teams will be organized in various places to distribute propaganda in the countryside; (5) Lecture meetings will be held in various schools; (6) Special propaganda will be held in various cinemas, theaters, and entertainment venues. In addition, a large number of propaganda materials have been prepared to be sent to the battlefields for distribution. In addition, the Central Broadcasting Station has invited ministers and officials of various departments to give broadcast speeches during the propaganda week. It is reported that those who have been scheduled include President Kong of the Executive Yuan, President Dai of the Examination Yuan, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister Chai of the Central Propaganda Department, Minister Chen of the Political Department, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, and Minister He of the Ministry of Military Administration.

### In a Restaurant Commemorating Lost Territories

â€” Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya

Alone in Changde, strolling the streets, I unexpectedly ran into old friends Liu Chongren and Jinwu Erjun, whom I hadn't seen in ten years, along with a new acquaintance, Mr. Xu. We were all as delighted as if we had shot down an enemy plane out of nowhere. We decided to go to the "Jing Su Cuisine Restaurant" for lunch to enjoy a long-overdue reunion. Unexpectedly, as we were about to attack the cold appetizers, a siren wailed loudly. Other customers rushed downstairs, and we had no choice but to follow their lead, hurrying down to grab a boat to cross the river (many small boats were moored along the Yuan River bank for people to escape). However, those who couldn't row themselves were left drifting in the middle of the river, exposed targets for machine-gun fire. We drank the west wind in the graves for half an hour on the opposite bank before returning to eat the cold dishes newly seasoned with â€“ bomb-shaken dust. This was like a warning: "Don't forget the national crisis while eating!"

The Jing Su Cuisine Restaurant has clean windows and attentive service, a unique style among inland restaurants. It's said that the restaurant was recently opened by a group of capable Suzhou refugees, based on the principle of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength." In their organization, the upper-class refugees with legal tender in their pockets naturally became shareholders and bosses; the middle-class refugees, who were either close relatives of the upper class, sociable women, or skilled cooks, took on roles as accountants, buyers, receptionists, and chefs; and the rest, lacking the qualifications of the upper two classes, were generally demoted to delivering dishes, washing dishes, and doing odd jobs. Initially, I thought: since they â€“ the people are from Suzhou, speak Suzhou dialect, and the cuisine is purely Suzhou style with dishes like "Ten Tragic Scenes" and "Lion's Head" â€“ why not simply rename the restaurant "Suzhou Cuisine Restaurant"? Wouldn't that be even more popular? But they didn't change it that way, and later I realized that Jesus had his own reasons.

Speaking of the restaurant's waitresses, some might imagine they are seductive and mysterious women like their fellow townsman Lin Daiyu or their professional peer Zhuo Wenjun. In fact, they have no mystery at all, nor do they deliberately act coy or seductive. They serve you dishes briskly and chat with you seriously. And sometimes, when they are chatting happily with you, she will suddenly raise her eyebrows, clap her hands together as if they were half-opened ivory fans with a loud "bang," as if she has caught the most hateful thing in the world and wants to grind it to dust in her palms, rubbing them vigorously for a few moments before quickly separating her hands with a slight sigh. Friend, if you are not a fairy from the moon, but a citizen of the Republic of China, you will immediately realize that she is a modern woman with the same family and national hatred as you.

On that day, I asked one of the waitresses, who had such a standard demeanor, in a counter-attacking manner: "Geli dou yi jiao guan hao, a xiang hui Suzhou qu?" (The scenery here is very good, do you want to go back to Suzhou?) This sentence of "classically awkward" Suzhou dialect actually received the desired effect:

"Wei fu xiang hui qu!" (Why wouldn't I want to go back!) But she seemed to know that I hadn't received a "Suzhou Language School" diploma, so the second sentence she spoke in fluent Mandarin: "We left our lovely hometown the winter before last! When we set off, we were so scared by the heavy gunfire that we didn't even pack our luggage properly and fled from the countryside. On the way, we learned that the Japanese hadn't yet reached Suzhou; it was Liu XX's troops, who had always had bad discipline, causing trouble. Later, after suffering countless hardships, we fled to Wuhan. After finally catching our breath, the situation became tense again, and we were evacuated here. We fled to three or four provinces, and we pawned and ate everything. If it weren't for my younger brother shining shoes and earning a few cents to survive, we would have been helpless in Hankou long ago... Recalling our lovely hometownâ€”Suzhou, where there are our beautiful mountains and rivers, our fields and ancestral graves, our relatives and friends, especially my old grandmother, my mother and sister who were lost on the way; drifting in a foreign land, whenever we encounter difficulties, we really wish we could immediately grow wings and fly back to Suzhou, find my loving mother, and cry to her to my heart's content in her arms, even if it means dying!

"However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized it wasn't right;" Her tone suddenly changed from mournful to passionate. Her eyebrows were also raised at this moment: "Our hometown is still under the rule of the Japanese and traitors. The Japanese have killed tens of thousands of our male compatriots in our occupied areas. Are these male compatriots not human? They have raped countless of our sisters. Are they supposed to be supplies for the Japanese army to ravage? If we go back now, aren't we jumping into a fire pit with our eyes open, and giving ourselves to the Japanese to be slaughtered and humiliated in vain? Wouldn't that kind of miserable situation of being slaughtered and humiliated be thousands of times more painful than fleeing?

"So, since we're here, let's stay. Before we drive the Japanese away, even if we wander for a lifetime and die in poverty, we will never dream of returning home to be obedient citizens; unless we go back as female guerrillas. Also, the reason our restaurant is called Jing Su Cuisine Restaurant is not just because of the special dishes of Jing and Su, but to remind the customers who come here to eat sooner or later: If we are fellow villagers, we should not be happy and forget 'Su'; even if they are compatriots from other provinces, they should not easily forget the lost territories..."

Her conversation, woven almost entirely with blood and tears, expressed the tenderness of a daughter in its sorrow and the heroic spirit of a knight in its tragedy, both of which could win the sympathy and indignation of the listener. She and her group of sisters, in this earth-shattering wave of resistance against Japan, will surely produce a character like the heroine of Zola's book "Nana," a singer of similar background and worth. I wanted to ask a few more â€“ at least questions about the real situation of the refugees, and chat with them patiently. However, I was afraid that my three friends would misunderstand, thinking that I was not there to treat them, but to interview women from Suzhou. So, I had to turn the conversation back to the three of them.

The heroic victory in Taierzhuang, the fierce battle for the Dabie Mountains to defend Wuhan, all three of them participated in these events, and two of them even bore glorious wounds. They talked about how fierce these major battles were, how brave our army was. They described everything so vividly, it felt as if we were there. It was truly inspiring and exhilarating. On the contrary, we frankly admitted that during the first phase of the war of resistance, our weapons were slightly inferior to the Japanese, which sometimes led to the heroic sacrifices of the soldiers on the front lines. But hearing this did not discourage us. It only deepened our respect for the spirit of sacrifice of the soldiers!

For example, Mr. Xu said with great sorrow: The XX army came from a certain border province, and most of its soldiers were simple, honest, and brave. They usually believed in the doctrine of spiritual victory over material, and when they fought, they would rush forward with courage. Of course, this often led to great victories, but it also resulted in tragic deaths and sacrifices. The reason why this army was able to make outstanding contributions and win praise at home and abroad in the Taierzhuang battle was due to this.

Mr. Xu was a junior officer in that army. On the second day after the army was urgently deployed to the Taierzhuang front line at night, in the faint morning light, amid unfamiliar scenery, Mr. Xu vaguely saw several turtle-shaped objects arranged in the grass in front of him, but he couldn't tell what they were. Fortunately, there was a squad leader named Wang under Mr. Xu's command who had traveled to many places and had a broader knowledge, so he went over and asked him:

"Squad Leader Wang! What are those strange things?"

"It doesn't matter. Those are Shandong tombstones."

But less than three minutes later, those "Shandong tombstones" began to crawl and move, and under the cover of several tongues of fire spitting out "ge ge ge" sounds, they rushed towards our direction!

"Damn it, these strange things are probably tanks, right? I don't believe they can swallow people!" Squad Leader Wang bravely jumped out of the trench and used hand grenades to welcome those things that were really tanks. The other brothers caught sight of Japanese soldiers following closely behind the tanks and rushed forward like hibernating dragons emerging from the earth, tigers descending from the mountains, and immediately launched the first fierce melee combat between the strong men of that province and foreign soldiers!

The result of this fierce melee was a great victory, but it also led to a pitiful joke, namely, Squad Leader Wang's mistake of recognizing tanks as Shandong tombstones while trying to look smart and knowledgeable. However, this example of risking life and limb against steel and iron not only did not affect the glory of the victory in Taierzhuang but also made the results of the first phase of the war of resistance even more heroic. In short, this was an inevitable phenomenon in the first phase of the war of resistance. In the current second phase of the war of resistance, not to mention the battlefield between the north and south, we have mechanized units, chemical units for passive anti-gas warfare, and the new and sharp air force actively adopting offensive tactics, all showing a spirit of progress and innovation, successively producing unprecedented wonders, and about to bear the beautiful fruits of a new worldview!

### U.S. President's Speech Condemns Dictatorial Regimes, Resolves to Defend Freedom of Religion, and Requests Congress to Allocate Funds to Strengthen National Defense

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] President Roosevelt, in a speech commemorating the 150th anniversary of the U.S. Congress today, solemnly declared the benefits enjoyed by the American people under a democratic system and compared them with those enjoyed by people under dictatorial rule. He stated, "Some people outside believe that our system is outdated and will restore a system of personal rule. However, the system of personal rule has been proven to be autocratic and incompetent for two thousand years. The United States will not encourage them to believe in this system. Our representative democracy is very different from the dictatorships of recent years." President Roosevelt stated that there are two major differences between these two systems: the principle of democratic politics is that "everyone can freely choose policies and that there is a bill of rights to protect American democracy." He also stated that American trials implement a jury system, while trials in some countries follow methods from the dark ages. He wondered if Americans have compared the two.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] President Roosevelt submitted a report to a joint session of the Senate and House of Representatives today, stating that the United States cannot encourage countries with tyrannical regimes. Before Roosevelt's speech, Pittman and Chief Justice Hughes also delivered speeches. Chief Justice Hughes was the first person in American history to deliver a speech in Congress. In his speech, he praised the protections granted to the people by the Constitution and warned the people not to be emotional or influenced by prejudices, lest they endanger the fundamental interests of democratic countries. In his speech, Roosevelt stated that there are two types of systems in the world today: democracy and dictatorship. The former is based on human rights stipulated in the Constitution, while the latter is based on personal intentions. Freedom of religious belief is a universal right of mankind. Where democratic systems cannot prevail, the freedom of the people's belief is also completely deprived. Should we ignore this phenomenon and promote the arrogance of rejecting religion? The United States will never do this.

[Reuters, Berlin, 5th] President Roosevelt's speech in Congress yesterday has once again aroused the anger of Germany. Semi-official commentators stated that President Roosevelt's words were completely fictitious, especially Roosevelt's claim of religious persecution, which was even more absurd, and they also expressed great dissatisfaction with Roosevelt's proposal for freedom of publication.

[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] The U.S. President has requested Congress to allocate more than 122.3 million yuan to strengthen national defense, including more than 55 million yuan to strengthen the army's strength, 44 million yuan to build coastal defense works, more than 760,000 yuan to increase the air force's strength on various islands, 730,000 yuan to train 20,000 civilian pilots, and the rest to be allocated to nautical surveying expenses. At the same time, he requested Congress to increase the number of naval personnel by more than 110,000. It is said that the most serious issue in increasing naval personnel is the construction of warships. According to official estimates, the number of Yu army officers can increase from 448 to more than 10,000, and the number of Marine Corps officers can increase from 73 to more than 1,400.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] President Roosevelt recently sent a letter to Speaker of the House of Representatives Bankhead, requesting the immediate passage of an additional army budget of $122,383,237 (note: the House of Representatives has already passed the funding required for the army portion of the national defense expansion plan, $499,857,936). Its uses are as follows: (1) Purchase various necessary military equipment, such as anti-aircraft guns, tanks, defensive artillery, cannons, gas masks, etc.; (2) Train 20,000 civilian aviation pilots; (3) Supplement the defense of the Panama Canal, requiring a total of $1,416,373. At the same time, President Roosevelt also stated that he would later request Congress to approve funding for the construction of roads in the Panama Canal area.

He has now returned to the capital and immediately met with Prime Minister Mussolini to present a report.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 4th] The French-Italian dispute, which had been put on hold because of the Pope, has now "resurrected" with the election of the new Pope. Political figures here believe that Cardinal Pacelli's election is very promising. The new Pope enjoys a high international standing, has a broad vision, and is familiar with international diplomatic issues. Although the Pope will not come forward to mediate the French-Italian dispute, it is hoped that he will indirectly find a way to resolve the French-Italian problem through diplomatic channels, as everyone still remembers that the new Pope's first speech was that he would take promoting international peace as his duty.

### U.S. Labor Dispute, Roosevelt Intervenes to Resolve

[Central News Agency, Port of Astoria, Oregon, USA, 4th] The Japanese cargo ship "Norway Maru" wanted to load 21 cars of steel at this port for transport to Japan. The dockworkers at this port refused to load it, and the strike has lasted for eight days. Some Chinese women and children have organized a picket line to monitor the docks. The local authorities have decided to prohibit the shipment of steel to Japan from tomorrow. The picket line immediately withdrew, and the dockworkers also expressed satisfaction, ending the strike.

### European Diplomatic Activities: Cooperation Between Romania and Poland; Germany's Demands Cause Unease in Italy

[Reuters, London, 5th] While current European diplomatic activities appear calm on the surface, their content is far from simple. Diplomatic sources believe Mussolini is waiting for the complete end of the Spanish Civil War before making his demands on France. Although no one dares to predict the specific content of these demands, it is generally believed that Mussolini may focus on political rights rather than territorial claims. The current focus of diplomatic activity seems to be in Warsaw and Beijing. Reports from Rome state that Italian journalist Gaida, after accompanying Ciano on his visit to Poland and returning to Italy, announced that Poland would soon form a joint front with Germany and Italy, proposing colonial demands. Gaida suggested that countries with large colonies should cede some of them to countries with large populations and strong development capabilities, replacing complete occupation with free trade. However, some uncultivated land in the world should be fully occupied by populous countries. Gaida concluded that Germany, Italy, and Poland are countries with cultivation labor, while Britain and France are not. According to news from Warsaw, the Polish government has decided to establish a colonial affairs department, specializing in domestic and international propaganda related to Polish colonies. The department will hire experts with knowledge of African languages and agricultural science to train "colonial pioneer personnel." After Ciano left Poland, Polish Foreign Minister Beck has been in intensive consultations with Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, who recently led a delegation to Poland. According to the Warsaw correspondent of the Times, the main issues discussed by the two foreign ministers were two: one was the attitude of both countries towards the Soviet Union, and the other was the discussion of Hitler's eastward expansion. The discussion of these two issues will begin with consideration of the existing Polish-Romanian military alliance. However, King Carol of Romania refused to help Poland establish a common border between Poland and Hungary after the Munich Conference, so relations between Poland and Romania have recently cooled. The correspondent also said that it is generally believed that King Carol of Romania has now expressed deep regret for this move, realizing that Germany's expansion of power through Ruthenia is a more serious threat. The Romanian Foreign Minister, entrusted with important responsibilities by his government, explained Romania's views on this issue and promoted Polish-Romanian cooperation, establishing a common barrier to prevent German or Soviet invasion. It is reported that the foreign ministers of Poland and Romania will also negotiate to improve relations with the Soviet Union. According to indirect messages received from Bucharest, Romania is paying close attention to this negotiation, and the results may completely change the attitude of Eastern and Southeastern European countries, adopting a policy of breaking away from German influence. It is said that Germany's economic demands in the Danube region have caused indirect unease in Italy. Observers believe that Polish Foreign Minister Beck's warm welcome to Ciano and the anti-German demonstrations in various parts of Poland occurred simultaneously for this reason. According to unconfirmed reports, the foreign ministers of Poland and Romania will discuss the Danube River issue. In addition to providing Polish goods with special convenience for transportation to the Black Sea and Danube ports, Romania will also grant Poland a free zone in Gdynia when the "Polish Corridor" has difficulties to compensate for Danzig and Gdynia. Polish Foreign Minister Beck is also attempting to improve relations between Hungary and Romania.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 5th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu arrived here this morning. Foreign Minister Beck hosted a banquet for him in the evening and delivered a speech, saying that Poland and Romania are rich in vitality, which is deeply believed by people. Although there are various changes in the international situation, our attitude is extremely calm and not pessimistic at all. Foreign Minister Gafencu replied that the determination of both countries to cooperate is an important factor. Other countries, regardless of size or distance, should consider this factor if they are working for European peace and culture, and it can be used as external assistance.

### Franco Government: U.S. Has No Immediate Intention of Recognition; Plan for Receiving Madrid is Drafted; Fascists Discussing Resumption of Transportation

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] Local newspapers say that the recall of U.S. Ambassador to Spain, Bowers (who returned to the U.S. yesterday from France on the Queen Mary), is a preliminary step towards the U.S. recognizing the Spanish rebel government. However, this statement has not been confirmed. It is claimed that the ambassador's return to the country is for government consultation, as with other ambassadors in recent months. If the Spanish government surrenders unconditionally, then the U.S. recognizing the Spanish rebel government is inevitable. However, Washington heard that the Spanish government forces will continue to resist. Local newspapers have listed countries that have not yet recognized General Franco, including all British dominions except Australia. General sentiment here does not encourage immediate recognition of the Franco government.

[Haitong News Agency, San Sebastian, 5th] According to the announcement here this morning, the military and technical plans of various departments regarding the reception of Madrid and various parts of the Spanish Republican Army have been prepared. Even if there is no resistance in the future, it must still be handled according to the steps of the military plan. It is reported that troops will be sent to garrison various villages and towns first, and relief groups will arrive later to distribute food and treat patients. At the same time, administrative organs will be established to maintain order.

[Haitong News Agency, San Sebastian, 5th] According to news, a senior military officer of the Spanish government will arrive in France to discuss the treatment of refugees in concentration camps in France and the issue of sending them back to the country. It is reported that the Spanish government has held talks with the French ambassador to discuss the resumption of postal and railway transportation between the two countries.

[Haitong News Agency, Burgos, 5th] According to news, the Spanish Franco government's tax revenue in 1938 increased by 400 million pesetas compared to previous years. General opinion believes that this is because the Franco government's economy is progressing. All taxes, except those promulgated in 1936, have no new additions or surcharges. Even during this wartime period, the increase in tax revenue is a good sign, and it is firmly believed that other economic advancements can be realized after Spain restores peace.

[Central News Agency, Burgos, 5th] General Franco has blockaded the various seaports of the Republican government and is bombing towns and cities of the government forces on the east coast. The Nationalist army has concentrated a large army of 200,000 people, preparing to launch a surprise attack to the south. Once there is a sign of demoralization in the government forces, the attack will begin immediately.

### British Ambassador to Germany: Henderson's Speech; Using the Words of the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary; Answers Concerns of Berliners

[Reuters, Cologne, 4th] British Ambassador to Germany Henderson delivered a speech at a banquet celebrating the establishment of the Anglo-German Association tonight, answering the concerns of Berliners. What Berliners are concerned about is: "What guarantee is there that your country's military buildup is not intended to attack Germany?" Henderson said that Chamberlain has stated in the House of Commons that Britain's military equipment is only used for self-defense. Foreign Secretary Halifax has also stated in the House of Lords that no politician in Britain wants to wage a war of aggression. Even if there is one, he cannot gain the support of the people. However, when Britain's independence and important interests are endangered, people of all parties will resolutely resist for the sake of self-defense.

### Yu Bin in America: Establishes Office; Asks Red Cross to Continue; Aiding Chinese Refugees

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] Dr. Yu Bin, Bishop of the Nanjing District, lectured to all the students of Columbia University and New York University in New York on the 1st of this month. After the lecture, he went to Washington to meet with Davis, President of the American Red Cross, to express his gratitude for the organization's charitable efforts to aid refugees in China, and asked the organization to continue to aid Chinese refugees. Bishop Yu has established an office at 1514 Wisconsin Avenue in Washington.

### German Passenger Plane: Disappeared Last October; Found Near Nice

[Reuters, Berlin, 5th] Lufthansa announced yesterday that a wrecked plane near Nice is the company's plane that disappeared last October. The plane was an ordinary passenger plane, flying between Frankfurt and Milan, with two pilots and a capacity of ten passengers.

### Weidemann Goes to San Francisco: To Take Office as Consul General; Hitler During the Great War; Used to Transmit Telegrams for Him

[Reuters, New York, 5th] Weidemann arrived here yesterday and is transferring to San Francisco to take office as German Consul General there. He refused to talk about politics, saying that his only purpose here is to seek "goodwill." Talking to visitors, he said that during the World War, Hitler was his subordinate telegraph transmitter, and was truly a "good soldier."

Short Commentary

### An International Situation of Mixed Surprise and Joy

Spring has arrived; horses are fat, and people are healthy. It is the season for battle. The international news of the past few days has already begun to use the most sensational words of battle: "tension," "serious," "critical"! This news tells us how the fascist aggressors are more crazily expanding the crisis of world war, which is shocking. This news also tells us the awakening and preparations for resistance of democratic and peaceful countries, which is exciting. In addition to the comments in today's editorial, we feel that we should also list the recent facts of the active strengthening of the peace front.

First, the United States' attitude of supporting democratic countries with strength is more obvious. As a result of the Senate debate on national defense issues on March 3, the isolationists Johnson and Nye have failed, and most senators support Roosevelt's guiding foreign policy. At the same time, during the large-scale US naval exercises, the State Department is also conducting research with the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and Belgium on the issue of exchanging wartime raw materials.

Second, in addition to actively expanding its military and strengthening its defenses in the Far East, Britain has recently considered improving its relations with the Soviet Union. Although this cannot ignore the true face of the British rulers, Britain will be the main force in promoting Anglo-Soviet cooperation for its own interests and the demands of its people. At the same time, the approach of Britain and the Soviet Union will at least provide better conditions for Sino-Soviet cooperation.

Third, under the unanimous demand of the people, the French government has begun to increase its military strength in North Africa and the Far East, and has clearly stated that it will never give in on the colonial issue. The strength of the People's Front under the leadership of revolutionary and progressive parties continues to grow, and the voice of restoring Franco-Soviet cooperation begins to rise again.

Fourth, although the more progressive attitude taken by the British and French governments recently is a manifestation of easing the people's opposition movement after recognizing the Spanish rebels, it can also be seen that the strength of the People's Front in Britain and France has developed significantly.

Fifth, the anti-fascist and anti-aggression movements of the Japanese people and in Taiwan and Korea have been successively exposed under heavy guard and suppression, and anti-war and idle war movements have also occurred in the Japanese invading army in China.

In addition, what is particularly important is the oath of Soviet leader Stalin and the entire Red Army to defend the motherland and defend peace, and the development of defense forces and the strengthening of naval and air forces in the Far East, which are a major blow to the aggressors and the leading force for democracy and peace.

These facts increase our confidence in victory and our determination to struggle. We must use redoubled efforts to develop this struggle.

### Nursing Staff Association

The Hong Kong government authorities, in order to be prepared for danger in times of peace, have recently been actively preparing to cope with the advent of extraordinary times. Now, they are planning to organize a nursing staff association, preparing to participate in hospital nursing during wartime. Dr. Dewey, the host, announced yesterday that he hopes that women from all walks of life in Hong Kong will actively participate.

Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—Ã—, what will they think when they see this news? The Hong Kong authorities have to step up their wartime preparations, can it be that we Chinese sons and daughters have forgotten that our motherland and hometown are in the midst of an unprecedented disaster?

There are indeed many women in Hong Kong who have been and are working hard to save the country. Their fighting spirit under double oppression is often more admirable than that of men. However, they still account for only a very small minority of the total number of people. The number of people who are idle and indulge in love, superstition, and even gambling is shockingly large. We at least hope that all educated women will immediately choose a kind of work to learn or serve society and the motherland. We at least hope that women's organizations will take advantage of the eve of the March 8th Women's Day to mobilize the young women who have fallen outside the circle of saving the country, and let them embark on the broad road of fighting for their own liberation and defending themselves.

### Spain Under German-Italian Management

â€”Written by Frank Hanighen, Translated by Tan Zinong

Germany and Italy have a consolidated economic position in Spain, and they will certainly not want to withdraw. In the future, Spain will be a supply base for raw materials and a development area for commerce for Germany and Italy. Their superior position is like that of the East India Company in the 18th century and the Cecil Rhodes Company in the 19th century.

After Franco's victory, the economic potential of Germany and Italy will certainly increase, and democratic countries such as Britain and France will definitely be beyond their reach!

This expansion of Fascist economic power had already begun long before the Spanish Civil War. In 1934, Italian banking groups and German industrialists sent an engineer and a mining expert to the Iberian Peninsula (Spainâ€”translator) to investigate the geology. Sure enough, they left and returned by sedan chair, and they found rich mineral deposits, especially tungsten, carbon, and other major military raw materials. That was just when Franco was rebelling in Morocco.

Germany saw the rich resources and wanted to get involved. This may be a major reason why Germany helped Franco's rebellion. After Franco occupied the entire territory of Morocco, he controlled the entire mining industry of Morocco, and a German company, Hismalowo, managed the export affairs. Franco needed a large amount of military supplies to seize power, so he transported a large amount of pig iron to Hamburg as an exchange for purchasing military supplies from Germany. Before the war, the average monthly output of pig iron there was 70,000 tons, but under the control of Hismalowo, it has increased to 130,000 tons.

After Franco's army, with the assistance of German and Italian aircraft, advanced to the north of the Iberian Peninsula, the copper mines in the towns fell into the hands of Germany and Italy again. Before the war, Italy and Spain controlled the world's mercury market, and Almaden in Spain was the place with the richest mercury production. It is not surprising that Italy wants to occupy Almaden.

In 1937, Franco repeatedly advanced towards Bilbao in an attempt to seize the iron ore there; needless to say, this was also instructed by Germany and Italy. Therefore, Hitler said in a speech in Hustburg at that time, "I hope that after Franco's victory, he will seize the iron ore there."

However, this conflicted with Britain. Most of the iron used in British industry is imported from Spain, accounting for more than one-third. In Bilbao, several British mining companies are shareholders of the largest mining company in northern Spain, Aloguna La. Therefore, after Franco occupied Bilbao, the British government immediately sent a "commercial envoy" to negotiate with the Franco government to maintain Britain's interests in Bilbao, so that the iron there could continue to be transported to Britain. Sure enough, it was successful. The establishment of the "Non-Intervention Committee" was originally to play such a trick!

However, we have to say, does Franco really not benefit Germany? Needless to say, of course not. In December 1937 alone, 35,000 tons of pig iron were transported to Germany in the port of Basque. Therefore, the rumor that Germany and Britain shared the iron ore in Bilbao is not necessarily unfounded.

In addition, Germany has also established factories in Franco's occupied areas. For example, in Andaloosa, the textile center, there is Andaloosa Company established with German capital. A rayon factory and several tobacco companies established in the German section of Morocco are also German capital. Hamburg Shipping Company has also set up a branch in Spain. Germany is also planning Spain's transportation and aviation network, and many air routes have been completed and can be used.

While Germany's economic power is constantly expanding to Spain, Italy is also following suit, joining in the fun. In Milan, I saw Italian merchants smiling happily, making war profits from Spain. Italy's imports of Spanish pig iron increased from 33,000 tons in 1936 to 180,000 tons (1937); iron sheet imports increased from 327,000 tons to 500,000 tons; magnesium increased from 23,000 tons to 75,000 tons. Italian officials said that in 1937, they obtained 22,000 tons of pyrite from Spain.

In Milan, I saw many architects and engineers receiving construction business in Spain after the war. It is said that Italian magnets, rayon, rubber, and other goods are also being transported to Spain for sale in large quantities. Rome has also organized a semi-official financial institution to promote Italian business in Spain. The most important thing is the establishment of the Italian-Spanish Bank, with its headquarters in Rome. This is the driving force behind the expansion of Italian financial power to the Iberian Peninsula!

According to reports from Rome, the Italian government sent people to assist in the formation of the Franco government. Therefore, some people say that Franco's government's domestic and foreign affairs are solely led by Italy. Italy has sent many political spies to Spain. Bo Zhini, the head of the Italian secret police, has personally visited Spain. This is to start from the political aspect to achieve the effect of political and economic aggression.

However, will the expansion of the power of Germany and Italy conflict? There are different opinions on all sides. Some people think that since they are believers in Fascism and partners of the Berlin-Rome axis, they will certainly not conflict. Moreover, not only will they not conflict, but they may also unite to squeeze out the vested interests of democratic countries such as Britain and France in Spain. In Milan and Rome, I was told that British merchants would lend money to Franco as a bargaining chip.

According to the January issue of the "London Financial News," Italy's investment in Spain is 2.5 billion lire, while Germany's is 800 million marks. Some people say that Franco wants to borrow money from Britain and France to repay Germany's and Italy's debts and keep the raw materials for his own use. However, Germany and Italy will definitely oppose it.

After Franco's victory, Germany and Italy hope that Spain's economic system will be like theirs, so that Germany, Italy, and Spain can join hands economically. Will democratic countries such as Britain and France shrink back like this? (Translated from "The New Republic Weekly")

### Luohu Bombing Incident Resolved! Hong Kong Government Accepts Japanese Compensation of HK$20,000; Tanaka Visited Hong Kong Again Yesterday for Further Discussions; Opening of the Pearl River is Difficult to Achieve in the Short Term

(Central News Agency, London, 4th) It is confirmed that the Japanese government has paid HK$20,000 to the Hong Kong authorities as compensation for the previous bombing of the Hong Kong border by Japanese planes.

[Local News] Regarding the compensation issue for the losses caused by the wanton bombing of Luohu by Japanese aircraft, the negotiations between the British and Japanese representatives in Hong Kong, and the Japanese side's willingness to compensate only HK$20,000 for the losses in Luohu, has been reported in the newspapers. According to Western news, after the Hong Kong authorities negotiated with the Japanese side, they reported the amount of compensation that the Japanese side was willing to pay to London to wait for a decision. It is reported that the British authorities have accepted Japan's compensation, but on the principle that the Japanese side earnestly guarantees that such incidents will not happen again. As for how to guarantee, nothing has been heard yet. It is found that the Japanese plane invaded Luohu this time and dropped a total of six bombs, killing eight people, most of whom were Chinese. The loss of other tracks and houses is very large. This mere HK$20,000 is not enough to compensate. It is also found that Tanaka, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in South China, who came to Hong Kong to apologize to the British and negotiate compensation, has been in Hong Kong for many days. In addition to negotiating the Weihu issue with the British side, he accompanied Miyasaki Daiping and others again last night to meet with the local military and political authorities for further discussions. Regarding the opening of the Pearl River, according to the reporter's investigation, it is difficult to achieve in the short term. At present, the shipping between Guangdong and Hong Kong is once a week for Japanese merchants and twice a week for British ships.

### Preparing for the Arrival of Wartime! Actively Recruiting Nursing Staff; Hong Kong Government Organizing a Nurse Supplementary Service Corps; Seeking Participation of Women from All Walks of Life in Hong Kong for Training

The Hong Kong government authorities, in order to be prepared for danger in times of peace, are actively carrying out facilities related to preparing for the arrival of extraordinary times. In addition to air defense matters, which are handled by the Air Defense Commissioner in charge, and are being prepared properly, they are also carrying out the British Civil Service Plan. The recruitment of volunteer workers for firefighting and rescue is also being actively promoted. According to reliable sources, the proposal to establish a hospital nurse supplementary service corps is now being actively implemented, with Dr. Dewey in charge. According to Dr. Dewey, Britain is now conducting a universal recruitment of women to prepare to participate in hospital nursing work during wartime, encouraging them to study nursing techniques. The organization of the Hong Kong Nurse Supplementary Service Corps is to give those who are interested in obtaining this knowledge the best opportunity, and hopes that women from all walks of life will actively participate. It is reported that the implementation method of the plan is to provide essential training for nurses in lectures at the Mary Hospital every Wednesday morning at 10:00 am, starting from the 15th of this month. Participants are requested to submit application forms to Mrs. White of the Department of Health in the post office. The association will establish close contacts with organizations such as the St. John Ambulance Brigade Women's Air Defense League. Each of these associations will send representatives to serve on the association's subcommittees. Those who pass the first aid and nursing training exams can go directly to the hospital for practice. The Mary Hospital and Kowloon Hospital are currently designated as practice locations for students. Those who are not proficient in English will go to Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital and Lai Chi Kok Hospital for practice. As there are many women in Hong Kong who have nursing knowledge, the association is eager for these personnel to fully cooperate and serve as trainers or other teaching positions. The association is currently raising funds to recruit these workers.

### Demand Exceeds Supply: Major Landlords in Hong Kong and Kowloon Are Building New Apartments; All Units Are Pre-leased Before Completion; Monthly Rents Are More Than Double the Previous Rates

Recently, due to exchange rate fluctuations and the need for wartime supplies in various countries, the prices of metals have soared, especially the demand for iron. Taking Hong Kong as an example, its value is several times higher than it was a few years ago. According to general construction experts, although the price of iron is high, Hong Kong has not reduced its imports due to the high price. In recent years, wars have broken out in China, and both the rich and the poor consider Hong Kong a safe haven. The poor, unable to support themselves, have to rely on relief from aid organizations, but they are willing to rent cramped spaces to seek temporary shelter. The rich spare no expense in searching for land to build their own residences, or even pool large sums of money to invest in real estate. Therefore, recently, new buildings have sprung up everywhere on King's Road, near the Causeway Bay Police Station, Wanchai Road, Lockhart Road, Gloucester Road, and in Kowloon City, Sham Shui Po, and Gascoigne Road in Kowloon. However, due to demand exceeding supply, many people seeking housing negotiate rents with landlords in advance before construction is completed, to avoid being preempted by others. However, most of these new buildings have an area of one living room and two bedrooms. In normal times, the rent would be at most fifteen to twenty dollars per month. Today, it would be at least sixty or seventy dollars, but no one objects. Therefore, those who seek profit by hoarding goods are investing heavily in real estate construction, regardless of the high price of iron. The construction experts added that those who are unaware may think that the construction industry is booming this year, and those engaged in it should make big profits. In fact, it is not as good as a few years ago. Previously, the prices of various construction materials were low, so making a profit was easy. Today, apart from iron, the prices of other materials such as wood, copperware, and paint are also affected by rising prices. Many people are engaged in this, competing with each other to bid at low prices, so where is the profit? In short, the only ones who can really make big profits are the major landlords and large property owners.

### Student Relief Association Held a Representative Conference to Discuss Commemorating the Death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen

It is heard that to fully prepare for participation, the Student Relief Association specially convened a representative conference of various schools at the Hong Kong University Auditorium at 2:00 PM yesterday. About 100 people attended. First, the chairman of the association, Li Zhengyao, announced the reason for the meeting and mentioned the expectations of young people around the world for Hong Kong students. Then, they began to discuss mobilizing all students to participate in the memorial service to make all students understand the significance of this conference. There were also questions about the relationship between school work and student relief work. The meeting was adjourned at 5:00 PM.

### New Milk Disinfection Regulations Will Be Implemented Next Month; Violators Will Be Punished

To prevent the spread of cholera, the Hong Kong health authorities promulgated new regulations last year, stipulating that all milk shops in Hong Kong must sterilize and disinfect the milk they sell before selling it, to limit the spread of the disease. After the promulgation of these new regulations, the original plan was to implement them on January 1st of this year. Due to various reasons, the implementation has been postponed repeatedly. According to reliable information, the authorities have decided to fully implement the milk disinfection regulations from the 1st of next month. After that, all milk sold on the market must be disinfected in accordance with the regulations. Violators will be punished.

### Coal Coolie Shot Dead in Hamilton Street, Yau Ma Tei; Several Assailants Fled After the Attack; Victim Had No Quarrels with Anyone, Suspected of Being Mistakenly Killed

A tragic murder occurred on Hamilton Street, Yau Ma Tei, the day before yesterday afternoon. The victim was a coal coolie who was stabbed and sent to the hospital for treatment. The assailant fled without a trace. The injured person eventually died in the hospital at zero o'clock yesterday morning due to his injuries.

Coolie Stabbed

It was found that at 12:20 PM the day before yesterday, a coolie was walking along Hamilton Street in Yau Ma Tei when he was suddenly attacked by several people holding cleavers, iron bars, and sword-like weapons, without any reason. He was stabbed several times and seriously injured on the spot, collapsing in a pool of blood. Nearby residents who witnessed this and recognized the stabbed person immediately informed his mother. Upon hearing that her son was attacked, his mother rushed to the scene to see what happened. Before long, the police siren sounded, and the on-duty police, upon hearing the news, rushed to the scene to investigate. The assailants, seeing the situation was not good and fearing arrest, immediately fled. The police then called for an ambulance to take the injured person to the hospital for treatment, while strictly searching for the assailants. However, the assailants had disappeared without a trace and could not be found.

Seriously Injured, One Life Lost

It was also found that the injured person was named Huang Jingxiang (26 years old), his father was Huang Rong, who worked as a coolie, his mother Zhou Huan, who usually worked in Baker Street "peeling garlic", and his younger brother Huang Li (14 years old) lived on the third floor of No. 855 Canton Road, Yau Ma Tei. He usually transported coal as a coolie in the Hamilton Street area and was always safe and sound. Unexpectedly, he suddenly encountered an accident the day before yesterday afternoon. After being admitted to the hospital, although doctors performed surgery, his injuries were extremely serious, and he eventually died in the hospital at zero o'clock yesterday morning due to his injuries. When Huang was dying, he said that he vaguely recognized one of the assailants, a man named Liang, and another named Cai, as triad members. The police are now strictly investigating the assailants. It was also found that the deceased was stabbed a total of four times, once in the chest, once in the back, once in the waist, and once in the left wrist, deep enough to see the bone. According to his family, Huang was always peaceful and never had any quarrels or other incidents with anyone. It can be determined that Huang's sudden accident was a case of mistaken killing.

### Late at Night, a Dancing Girl Was Lured and Robbed; Kwan Hing-hing Lost Up to One Hundred Dollars

Kwan Hing-hing, a 20-year-old dancing girl from the Imperial Palace Dance Hall on Des Voeux Road Central, who lived on the second floor of No. 65 Wing Lok Street, was returning home at about 2:00 AM yesterday morning after dancing. When she arrived in front of the dance hall, she suddenly encountered a man named Ah Tong, nicknamed Dirty Tong, who approached her and spoke to her, inviting Kwan to go to Lockhart Road, Wan Chai, saying that a certain Westerner was waiting for her there. Kwan, knowing Tong as an acquaintance and such things often happening, did not suspect him. When they arrived at a certain number on Lockhart Road, Tong led Kwan straight to the rooftop, telling her to wait a moment while he brought the Westerner over. Kwan nodded. After a few moments, Tong returned, and as Kwan was about to ask him about it, Tong suddenly and unexpectedly pushed Kwan down and threatened her, forbidding her from making a sound. He forcibly took her two gold rings and a gold watch that she was wearing and ran down the stairs, fleeing without a trace. Afterwards, Kwan went to the police station to report the case, stating the above, and saying that the lost jewelry was worth about ninety-five dollars, requesting that the case be filed and investigated.

### War Affects Internal Transport; Hong Kong Rice Merchants Rarely Profit; Population Increase Leads to a Boom in Small Rice Shops; Hong Kong Government Stores Large Quantities of Grain Sufficient for One Year's Needs

Hong Kong's food supply relies on rice from Siam and Annam. The annual import figure is enormous. At the same time, Hong Kong is also the general hub for the export coast of South China. The foreign rice sold to the mainland is all supplied through Hong Kong. Therefore, the annual sales of foreign rice in Hong Kong and its re-export through Hong Kong amount to tens of millions of dollars. Last year, due to the outbreak of war and the blockade of the Pearl River waterway, the import of foreign rice into Guangdong was severely hit. The transport of Annam and Siam rice to Hong Kong plummeted. Taking October of last year as an example, the number of Siam rice shipments to Hong Kong was the lowest on record for the past year, decreasing by more than 80% compared to normal times. In November, it slightly picked up and gradually returned to normal. However, after December, it fell drastically again. Although some merchants searched for and purchased large quantities to transport north during this period, they still could not make up for the losses. On the contrary, the Hong Kong market was quite prosperous due to the increase in the number of people coming to Hong Kong. This situation was unprecedented. However, judging from the business of rice shops last year, few were able to make a substantial profit.

Population Increase, Huge Supply of Foreign Rice

It was found that before the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Siam rice had the second largest market share in Hong Kong, according to the export statistics issued by the Siamese Government's Statistics Bureau. Later, due to China's control over the import of foreign rice and the imposition of heavy taxes, it had dropped to eighth place. In the past, many of those who re-exported foreign rice from Hong Kong to mainland China shipped it directly from Annam and Siam. At the same time, the South China Rice Industry Company set up methods in various provinces of South China to regulate grain, using domestic rice to help out where needed. Hong Kong's position was purely as a transit station for the import of foreign rice. Now, due to this impact, the number of rice imports into Hong Kong has inevitably been declining. During this one year and ten months, Guangdong Province, due to disasters, droughts, and poor harvests, repeatedly appealed to the central Ministry of Finance to exempt rice taxes, so as to regulate food and relieve people's difficulties. At that time, all rice merchants in Hong Kong believed that it was a good opportunity for their business. However, each time the Ministry of Finance approved it in the form of registration, the Hong Kong rice merchants were greatly disappointed. Fortunately, the number of people fleeing to Hong Kong increased daily, and the number of residents suddenly increased by hundreds of thousands. The demand for foreign rice was huge, and the rice shop business gradually showed vitality, and it was quite profitable. Although it could not restore the prosperity of the past, it was still barely satisfactory. However, in general, few were able to make a profit.

Adapting to the Environment, Small Rice Shops Increase Greatly

However, the business of general small rice shops was quite good. It was found that in the past year, the lowest rice price was about 13 catties per dollar. To stabilize the people's food supply and meet future needs, the Hong Kong government has continuously stored huge quantities, which has increased the demand for foreign rice and greatly helped the development of the rice industry. It is estimated that the current rice reserves in Hong Kong can supply the residents of Hong Kong for more than one year. On the small rice shop side, before the Lunar New Year, they jointly organized a "distribution house" to directly purchase rice from major rice shops in Annam and Siam for retail. As for the distribution houses, in order to maintain their business and compete with the small rice shops, after several meetings and discussions, they set up distribution points in various districts, a total of 30 in the first six months, distributed throughout Hong Kong and Kowloon, for systematic sales. The business situation was extremely smooth. Therefore, in addition to the 30 distribution points set up by the distribution houses, people in the rice industry also followed suit and set up no less than 20 or 30 distribution points. At present, there are a total of 60 or 70 newly established small rice shops in various districts of Hong Kong, and their business is quite developed.

### Salary System for Senior Hong Kong Civil Servants Will Be Improved; Second and Third Grades Will Be Merged into One; Annual Salary Can Also Be Increased for Those Without Promotion Opportunities

According to a reliable source cited in the Hong Kong English Sunday newspaper, the part of the Hong Kong government civil servants' salary grade plan concerning senior and accounting personnel is about to be implemented. The new method concerns senior civil servants receiving salaries in pounds, whose salaries will increase annually, from the current 445 pounds to 560 pounds. According to an explanation by a senior civil servant, in short, the main point of this new method is to merge the second and third salary grades into one. Because under the current method, the salaries of civil servants receiving pounds are divided into three grades. The highest amount for the first grade is an annual salary of 700 pounds, the second grade is 560 pounds, and the third grade is 445 pounds. Because there are not many vacancies in the second grade, even if they reach the highest amount in the third grade and have been there for many years, they cannot get a salary increase because they have not been promoted. Therefore, there are many civil servants who are stuck in the third grade. According to the new method, even if they are not promoted, they can continue to increase their salary annually, up to the highest amount in the second grade. Also, according to the new method, the salary method for civil servants selected in England to come to Hong Kong will also be adjusted accordingly. Some of them stipulate that the relevant civil servants can choose the new method or the current method. It is heard that the main point is that the base salary is reduced, and the housing and other allowances are increased. Not long ago, the Western police also made a request similar to the above plan regarding the salary method, abolishing the grade restrictions for lower-ranking police officers, increasing their salaries annually without promotion, and the maximum amount could be increased to the salary of a regular police inspector.

### Every Inch of Land is Precious; Old Houses Are Being Rebuilt; There Is a Great New Building on Connaught Road

Recently, due to the sudden increase in population in Hong Kong, every inch of land is precious. Not only is this true for residential housing, but ordinary office space is also extremely difficult to rent. Therefore, speculative landlords are mostly rebuilding old houses into high-rise buildings to meet the demand. Recently, the Hong Kong Land Company's property at No. 2 Connaught Road (next to Taikoo Yanghang) was completely demolished and rebuilt into a twelve-story building, which will be used exclusively for office space when completed. The drawings are currently entrusted to Palmer and Turner architects for design. After the drawings are reviewed and approved, demolition will begin.

### Hong Kong News in Brief

### Car Crashes into a Large Tree; Three Westerners Injured on Yuen Long Road; Driver's Injuries Are Quite Serious

At 2:15 PM yesterday afternoon, a car accident occurred near the Fanling Refugee Camp in the New Territories, injuring people. It was said that three Westerners were driving a private car No. 3310 from Tai Po to Yuen Long. When driving to the section between Sheung Shui Wai and the Fanling Refugee Camp, the driver accidentally crashed into a large tree on the side of the road. The entire car was destroyed. The throat of the Westerner driving the car was seriously injured by glass. The two Westerners sitting in the back of the car were also injured. After the accident, nearby villagers witnessed the situation and immediately called for an ambulance to the scene to send the three injured to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. It was found that the driver's injuries were quite serious.

### Japan's Trade with Hong Kong Increases Greatly; Cloth Imports, Tungsten and Silver Exports in Large Quantities; Imports in January Increased by 500,000 Yuan Compared to the Same Month Last Year; Japanese Gray Cloth Intended as Native Cloth Is Also Shipped in a Steady Stream

According to the Hong Kong Import and Export Department's import and export statistics for January of this year, both imports and exports of Japanese goods have increased compared to the previous year. The statistics only state that imports and exports of Japanese goods have increased, but do not explain in detail what items have increased. The reporter believes that this matter has attracted much attention in society, so he tried to investigate the situation. The following is a summary report of what has been found in recent days. In January, Japanese goods imported into Hong Kong increased by more than 500,000 yuan compared to last year. In January last year, the imported Japanese goods were only worth 1,267,770 yuan, while this year it increased to 1,751,228 yuan. Nearly all of the increase of 500,000 yuan is Japanese cloth. This Japanese cloth is not high-priced cloth but cloth costing a few yuan. The Japanese cloth that is usually sold by street vendors as Kowloon native cloth is 9 out of 10 from Japan. There are about 20 or so cloth shops in Central that specialize in selling this kind of Japanese native cloth. Late in the Lunar New Year, it was January in the Gregorian calendar. Ordinary families often bought new clothes at this time. They either benefited from the cheaper price of Japanese native cloth, or lacked the ability to distinguish it, and ended up selling Japanese goods in large quantities. Last year, the 20 or so Japanese cloth shops all made profits. As a result, Japanese cloth imports to Hong Kong increased by hundreds of thousands of yuan. Secondly, imports of Japanese raw cloth were also high last month. These raw cloths have no color. Some merchants buy them, add dye to the color, and turn them into "native cloth" again. Exports of goods to Japan also increased last month, from 257,962 yuan to 261,896 yuan. One reason for this increase is that the sales of tungsten to Japan have been increasing daily. Another reason is the increase in the export of silver bracelets to Japan. What is the intention of exporting silver bracelets to Japan? Those who know know. Some merchants specialize in melting silver into silver bars and hammering them into silver bracelets before shipping them to Japan. This is why the export of treasures from Hong Kong also increased greatly last month.

### Thieves Are Becoming Increasingly Rampant; Three Car Thefts in Two Days; Major Theft Case Occurs on Connaught Road Central; Losses of Silver and Goods Exceed 1,500 Yuan

Recently, thieves in Hong Kong and Kowloon have become increasingly rampant. Yesterday, the owner of No. 29 Connaught Road Central, Ho King-lo, was visited by thieves, who stole silver and goods worth 1,500 yuan. He was also robbed of his handbag, with losses amounting to 110 yuan. He reported the case to the police station. Also, a staff member of Jardine Matheson & Co., Mr. He, had his private car stolen by a thief on Friday of last week. The car was parked in the Pedder Street car park at the time. Also, two car thefts occurred yesterday. First, Mr. Swaff had his Austin car stolen by a thief, license plate number 1692. The car was parked in the Connaught Road Central car park. Second, a Westerner, Mr. Porter, parked his private car in the Chater Road car park at 8:30 PM yesterday. When he returned at 12:00 AM, the car was gone.

"Charity Scoundrels" Make a "National Crisis Fortune" - Kind Benefactors Should Be Careful When Loosening Their Pursestrings!

### "Charity Scoundrels" Make a "National Crisis Fortune" - Kind Benefactors Should Be Careful When Loosening Their Pursestrings!

In the early days of the all-out sacred War of Resistance, there were truly countless organizations soliciting donations door-to-door. At that time, overseas Chinese believed that these people were all running around with enthusiasm for the country, so they did not hesitate to donate as much as they could. Cunning people took advantage of this weakness, working hard to run around and appeal during the day, and in the evening, they happily divided up the donations obtained through grand fundraising appeals in rooms booked at hotels. Later, the police authorities, fearing that someone would take advantage of the situation (in fact, there were already quite a few successful villains), began to crack down on this kind of disorganized fundraising method. Because it was not as free as before and added many obstacles, these poorly organized fundraising groups quietly disappeared not long after! And those "people who were working hard to save the country" at this time, except for a few who had already amassed a sum of money, had to find other ways out. Because "fundraising" seemed to be their unique expertise, they had no choice but to continue doing fundraising work. On the other hand, it seemed that fundraising could not do without them, so they turned to more legitimate fundraising organizations!

Those who run these more "legitimate" fundraising organizations seem to be people who are "a bit famous." Although we dare not say that they are scoundrels, their unconscious behavior cannot help but arouse our suspicions. In particular, the fundraisers they recruit are simply too repulsive to us. Not long ago, two fundraising organizations sent people out to solicit donations. It is true that the fundraising goals they advocated were worthy of our sympathy, but what was surprising and unsatisfactory was that every time they came, the faces of the people representing a new organization to solicit donations were familiar to us. Every time, they would fluently state the purpose of the fundraising this time, smiling and encouraging people to contribute a little more. However, their professionalized fundraising methods no longer arouse the sympathy of the general public, but rather deepen their disgust!

The reporter encountered two groups of fundraising staff sent out by a certain organization raising funds for the injured and disaster relief yesterday in different locations. As expected, it was still those familiar faces, sophisticated fundraising methods, and persuasive rhetoric.

I have never been able to figure out whether the "legitimate" fundraising organizations themselves have become professionalized, or whether the professionalized fundraisers have professionalized the fundraising organizations! In short, no matter what, it will not have a good impact on the future of legitimate fundraising.

We cannot bear to see the patriotic people in society have their useful money pocketed by these social vermin, which instead reduces the economic power of the War of Resistance. Therefore, we take this opportunity to frankly and candidly inform the public of these matters, hoping that when compatriots donate money, they should pay attention to the following points:

(1) Whether the fundraising organization is a legal organization.

(2) Whether the person in charge of the organization is reliable.

(3) No matter how much the amount is, it is safest to hand it directly to the bank.

(4) For those who have not solicited donations, pay attention to whether they are people who are professional fundraisers. If so, the request should be refused, because any "organization" represented by these people has not been organized through legal procedures, so they do not hesitate to use false fundraising as a sharp tool.

Finally, the reporter solemnly declares to the readers that the motive and purpose of writing this article is only to expose the tricks of the scoundrels, so that the donations made by the public will not end up in the pockets of the scoundrels, but will be used for the sacred purpose of saving the country. I hope that the public will have a more correct and appropriate understanding of the channels for donating money in the future, and I hope that they will be able to work harder to donate money in the future, and do not be discouraged because bad guys and scoundrels are making trouble!

### The Offensive is Exhausted; Our Troops on Hainan Island Still Hold the Initiative

Local Guerrilla Forces Also Rise Up in Activity to Annihilate the Enemy; Wang Yi Leads Soldiers and Civilians in a Vow to Fight to the Death Against the Enemy

[Guangzhou Quick Report] Since the enemy landed on Hainan Island, actively reinforced their forces, and attempted to penetrate deep into our territory, they have met with strong resistance from our local security forces and self-defense corps. The enemy offensive is exhausted, and the battle has gradually reached a stalemate. The following is a record of the war situation on Hainan Island obtained from here:

Enemy Occupies Wenchang, Committing Heinous Massacres

It has been found that the enemy troops from Haikou Qiongshan dispatched infantry and cavalry along the Qiong (Shan) Wen (Chang) Highway a few days ago, advancing and occupying Wenchang County, an important stronghold in the northeast of our Hainan Island. Because the enemy troops encountered heroic resistance from our troops during the attack, they suffered heavy casualties. After entering the city, they carried out extensive burning and looting, inspecting and searching civilian houses and shops in the city in an attempt to eliminate our security forces and guerrilla teams. They subjected the villagers who could not escape in time to insults, harm, and murder. Furthermore, enemy soldiers went out to rape and plunder everywhere. All the grain, food, and property stored by the people of the whole city have been completely looted. According to intelligence, the enemy who attacked Wenchang numbered only five or six hundred. After our troops resisted step by step along the way, especially during the fierce battle with our troops in the suburbs, they suffered a severe blow, with casualties reaching three or four hundred. The enemy troops currently stationed in Wenchang city are thinly staffed and fear being attacked by guerrillas lurking nearby. They have been setting up machine gun positions at strategic points outside the city for several days, dispatching sentries to guard and watch, with extremely strict precautions.

Enemy in Ding'an Under Our Control

Since the enemy occupied Wenchang, they have been eager to eliminate our guerrilla forces lurking in the counties of Qiongshan, Wenchang, Ding'an, and Chengmai, and to coordinate with the enemy troops in Jiaji, Qiongdong. In recent days, they have been searching and advancing towards the surrounding villages. The enemy to the north of Ding'an and Chengmai have also repeatedly invaded southward, attempting to penetrate deep into the central part of our Hainan Island. However, the local villagers, seeing their fields, gardens, houses, and graves trampled and ravaged by the enemy, are filled with national hatred and family grievances, and they have all risen up to kill the enemy, joining the guerrilla organizations one after another. Therefore, the emergence of guerrilla teams everywhere in recent days is like a rising wind and surging clouds, attacking the enemy in various strongholds. The enemy is already feeling overwhelmed. In particular, our guerrilla teams in Qiongshan and Ding'an are even more active, launching repeated surprise attacks on the enemy troops in Qiongshan, Ding'an, and other places, with repeated gains. After our army withdrew from Ding'an, it took control of the surrounding mountainous areas and still held the initiative, surrounding and monitoring the enemy. Now, Ding'an is under our control.

Soldiers and Civilians Vow to Fight to the Death with the Enemy

It has been found that in recent days, the enemy troops have been continuously transferring reinforcements from Weizhou, Taiwan, Xiamen, and Guangzhou to Hainan, actively carrying out expanded invasion operations. It has been found that the defensive line of the enemy on Hainan Island is the ring road around the island, from Wenchang to Lingao, forming an isolated arc. The enemy is still trying to continue to extend this line and advance inland. However, as a result of the heroic resistance of our soldiers and civilians on Hainan Island, the enemy troops in various places have made no progress. Now, our army has built solid fortifications in Ding'an, Chengmai, along the south bank of the Henan River. If the enemy in the north continues to invade, we will resolutely strike head-on. Our security forces, self-defense corps, guerrilla teams, etc., stationed in Dongchuan, Ruixi, and Taiping areas, have more than ten thousand people, and have sufficient supply of weapons, ammunition, and food. They are led and commanded by Wang Yi, commander of the security forces brigade and garrison commander of Qiongya, and are determined to hold out against the enemy to the death. It will be difficult for the enemy to succeed in their attempt to advance further.

### Visitors from Haikou Talk About Haikou Becoming a World of Monsters and Demons; Female Hero Liu Shujue Rises Up and Kills More Than 200 of the Enemy; The Enemy Forms a New China Welcome Japan Allied Nations Association with Traitors; Enemy Merchant Sheng Tian Guides Enemy Troops to Attack Haikou and Other Places

Since the enemy landed on Hainan, the situation has been turbulent. Young men with even a slight sense of national consciousness have risen up to fight against the violent enemy. Those who cannot bear the enemy's oppression but have no power to resist have mostly fled in various ways. In the recent ten days, there have been many people escaping from Haikou by sailing boats to Guangzhou Bay and transferring to Hong Kong. Yesterday, a reporter met a merchant who had just escaped from Haikou in a business association and was told about the real situation in Haikou. The main points are recorded below:

Red Army Female General Rises Up

After the enemy landed in Haikou on the 16th, they dispatched hundreds of cavalry and infantry towards Wenchang County on the 28th. Our side, seeing that the enemy was fierce, retreated to the west of Jiaji (place name) to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. Liu Shujue, a veteran Red Army female general, rose up and organized more than 200 male and female guerrillas, who were based in the jungles and fought to the death with the enemy. Although the enemy had sharp artillery fire, they did not know the terrain, and ultimately suffered losses. In this battle, more than 200 of the enemy were killed.

Enemy Merchant Katsuta Acts as Guide

The fact that the enemy was able to quickly occupy Haikou, Xiwei, Haiyan, Saishi and other places was due to the guidance of Katsuta, an enemy merchant who had been in Haikou for decades. The local defense forces were negligent in defense on the one hand, and sparsely manned on the other. After the enemy occupied Haikou, shopkeepers and merchants who had something, ended their businesses and fled, Haikou suddenly became a dead city. Therefore, as soon as the enemy entered Haikou, they were eager to restore the prosperity of the market, while the enemy merchant Katsuta led the enemy troops to the nearby villages to summon the residents to return to the city to do business. Because the people refused, countless people were killed. Some people were forced to flee back to avoid their ferocity. The enemy now supplies funds to the general ignorant masses to open gambling dens, brothels, etc. They also tempt the citizens to organize the "New China Welcome Japan Allied Nations Association", with the traitors Mao and Tang as chairmen, doing all kinds of evil. At present, Haikou has become a world of monsters and demons.

### Our Supreme Military Authorities Allocate a Large Number of Warplanes to Guangdong

[Wengyuan Quick Report] According to news from military agencies here, the central government is extremely active in the military affairs of central Guangdong. Regarding the entire offensive and defensive strategy, they send telegrams to Commanders Zhang and Yu at any time to follow and implement. After the front lines in central Guangdong have been properly reconfigured, the central mechanical units and heavy artillery units have also entered Guangdong one after another to assist. As for the air fleet, a large team of new-type fighters manufactured in a certain country has also been allocated within the shortest possible time, and another special squadron XX has been placed under the direct command of the Fourth War Zone. It is foreseeable that the war in Baiyue will have a brand-new development.

### Enemy Transports a Large Number of Counterfeit Coins in Occupied Areas; Authorities Provide Methods for Distinguishing Genuine and Counterfeit Coins

[Shaoguan Quick Report] Since our country's war of resistance, the enemy military has suffered repeated failures, and their intelligence is exhausted. Recently, they have even used economic policy to invade, disguising enemy goods and mixing them into our country. Recently, they have intensified their efforts, privately transporting a large number of counterfeit Central Bank five-yuan banknotes to the south, and instigating traitors to use them in the occupied areas of Guangdong, attempting to disrupt our rear financial system. Our authorities have now ordered all military and civilians to be strictly on guard. The differences between the genuine and counterfeit coins are as follows: (1) Paper material: counterfeit coins have a waxy and smooth surface and are easily broken, while genuine banknotes are lustrous and resilient; (2) Paper pattern: counterfeit coins are blurry, while genuine banknotes are clear; (3) Watermark: counterfeit coins are vague and invisible, while genuine banknotes are clear; (4) Sun Yat-sen's image: genuine banknotes are exquisite and clear, while counterfeit coins are the opposite. The light patterns on the left and right of the image are thicker and blacker than the genuine ones; (5) Characters: genuine banknotes are bright black, while counterfeit coins are rough and dull black. There are no paper water ripples on the left and right of the characters; (6) Patterns: genuine banknotes are brightly colored, while counterfeit coins are the opposite; (7) Red seal: counterfeit coins are bright red, while genuine banknotes are jujube red.

### Dongzengbao Commando Executes Puppet Maintenance Society Chairman

â€”Yuan Huazhao is Still Aliveâ€”

[Shenzhen Quick Report] Yuan Huazhao, commander of the Dongzengbao Guerrilla Commando, has commanded his team in attacking the enemy in the guerrilla areas under his jurisdiction, and has achieved remarkable results. Yesterday, it was reported that Yuan had died of illness. The reporter visited Battalion Commander Wang of the XX Detachment of the unit currently stationed in Shenzhen to inquire about everything. According to Battalion Commander Wang, Commander Yuan suffered from dysentery at the end of last year and went to Hong Kong for treatment, staying at the Imperial Palace Hotel in Kowloon. Because his mother was living in Meiwo, Cheung Chau, Yuan returned home on Lunar New Year's Eve to visit his mother and spend the New Year for several days. Later, the troops received a letter from Yuan saying that the dysentery had healed and he would leave Hong Kong and return to the unit soon. However, due to his sickly body, he feared that he would not be able to cope with the heavy work, and he intended to resign. As for the saying that he died of illness, it is often a rumor. The reporter asked about the recent situation of the unit. Battalion Commander Wang said that apart from a small part of the unit being in Bao'an, the main part is still stationed in various parts of Dongguan Zengyu, attacking the enemy according to the opportunity. Ten days ago, the enemy troops burned Zhangmutou because the XX team of the unit moved from Dongguan to Dalang, captured the chairman of the Maintenance Society, and executed him. Afterwards, the enemy sent troops to search, but our team had already moved to another place. The enemy did not dare to advance any further, so they burned the villages in the area to vent their anger.

### Military Commission Orders All Counties to Organize Trained Young Men into Teams

[Shaoguan Quick Report] In order to mobilize trained young men from all provinces across the country to participate in the war of resistance and national construction, the Military Commission has now telegraphed the National Military Training Offices of all provinces to instruct the general headquarters of the social training corps of all counties to organize the trained young men into volunteer corps, and to organize various task forces for guard duty, construction, transportation, communication, rescue, and first aid. They must all hold separate assemblies and exercises. Furthermore, in order to examine the results of social training in various provinces, it has been decided to send a large inspection team to review the trained young men in various provinces and cities starting from March 1st. Li Jiewen, commander of the military training office, telegraphed all county and city social training chiefs yesterday to inform them.

### Wanting to Weaken Our Resistance; The Enemy in South China Implements a "Beauty Trap"; Sending Enemy Women Deep into the Interior to Incite the Villagers; The People Have a Deep Understanding of Righteousness and Are Not Tempted by the Deceptive Schemes

[Jiangmen Quick Report] The enemy's methods to harm us are extremely despicable. Apart from military means, they use everything. According to military intelligence, the enemy chiefs in South China have made no progress since entering Guangdong for several months. They know that they cannot win by military means alone. Recently, they have come up with a brilliant idea and sent out large groups of spies and instigated traitors to infiltrate our interior. In addition to spying on military intelligence, they also use various methods to mingle with our people, promoting their toxic propaganda and alienating our people. At the same time, in Guangzhou and Foshan, they have sent two or three or four or five Taiwanese and Korean women who have been trained and are familiar with the Cantonese language, who are divided into groups and infiltrate the occupied areas, or live in villages connected to the occupied areas, using their seductive tactics, sweet words, and vigorously promote the enemy military, and incite our ignorant women to prevent their husbands, sons, and nephews from joining guerrilla organizations, in the hope of weakening our resistance. Their intentions are extremely sinister. It has been found that many such incidents of enemy women's activities have recently been discovered in the villages of Sanshui, Nanhai, and Shunde counties. After receiving the report, the authorities yesterday issued a special order to all county governments and guerrilla commanders to strictly prevent and control them.

### After the Enemy Troops Withdraw, Shiling and Wancheng are Controlled by Us; Ye's Troops Attacked Wancheng Yesterday, Temporarily Gaining Dozens; Liang Baoren Sends Troops to Advance to Huangsonggang

[Shenzhen Quick Report] Wang Ruozhou, commander of the Fourth District Guerrilla, and Zhang Wodong, deputy commander, upon learning that the enemy entrenched in Wancheng Shiling Taiping was troubled and pressured by our guerrilla teams, and had withdrawn one after another, immediately ordered all subordinate units and teams to take advantage of the weak strength of the enemy troops in various places to launch attacks according to the opportunity. After receiving the order, various units have been advancing towards Wancheng Shiling Taiping and other places in recent days, strictly controlling the enemy troops. Liang Baoren, the county magistrate of Bao'an, has also transferred a group of elite troops, travelling along the Baotai Highway to the Huangsonggang Foziao area to set up an ambush, preparing to directly attack Taiping. It should not be difficult to eliminate the enemy troops entrenched in Dongguan County in one fell swoop. It has also been found that Ye Tieliang, commander of the Ninth Battalion of the Dongguan Self-Defense Corps, seeing that most of the enemy troops in Wancheng had withdrawn and their strength was weak, led his troops to launch a night attack on the enemy troops in Wancheng on the 2nd of this month. In the faint starlight, they arrived in Wancheng. The enemy troops were caught by surprise and did not know the strength of our army, so they retreated to a corner and resisted stubbornly. Our team then used its capabilities to surround the enemy on all sides and pounce on them. After more than an hour of melee, as dawn approached, our team gave a secret signal to withdraw in different directions along the original route. As a result of the fierce battle, more than twenty enemy officers and soldiers were injured and killed, and a large number of spoils were seized. At present, there are no more than two hundred enemy troops in Wancheng, retreating to the south of the city, guarding themselves all day long, daring not to move, and constantly panicking.

### When Transferring Positions, Telegraphs and Telephones Must Be Thoroughly Destroyed

â€¦The War Zone Command Issued a Notice Yesterdayâ€¦

[Shaoguan Quick Report] The commander's office of the Fourth War Zone believes that in the past, when the combat troops transferred positions, the destruction of telegraph and telephone lines was often overlooked, which was used by the enemy. Even if there was destruction, it was not thorough. The enemy could use it with a little repair. In the future, before the transfer of each unit, the unnecessary ones must be designated to be withdrawn by the responsible unit as much as possible, depending on the urgency of the situation. Those that should be retained should be thoroughly destroyed when transferring, so that the enemy cannot use them. The destruction methods are as follows, and the subordinate units were ordered yesterday to comply with them: (1) Cut off the pole one foot from the ground. If there is enough time, cut it into several sections; (2) Burn or blow up the telegraph pole; (3) Cut off the wires close to the insulators; (4) Destroy the magnetic insulators; (5) Remove the crossbars on the telegraph poles; (6) Extend the iron wires into the ground between the longitudinal gaps of the telegraph poles; (7) Wrap the heaviest iron wire between the two wires.

### Guangdong to Convene Provincial Financial Conference; Gu Yiqun to Schedule Meeting After Returning to Guangdong; New Financial Plan Submitted to Central Government for Review

[Shaoguan Quick Report] Due to the impact of the war, the province's tax revenue has sharply decreased, resulting in a monthly shortfall of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan in the province's revenue and expenditure. Gu Yiqun, director of the finance department, in addition to actively increasing revenue and reducing expenditure in order to fundamentally solve the problem, has also requested temporary subsidies from the national treasury. Gu also took the opportunity to go to Chongqing to attend the National Local Bank Conference to visit the central financial authorities and ask for instructions on the future direction of reorganizing the province's finances. According to recent news, Gu brought a new wartime financial plan for Guangdong Province to the north for submission to the central government for review. Once approved, Director Gu will schedule a provincial financial conference after returning to Guangdong, convene financial experts, local financial officials, announce the new plan and various measures, and take a general overview of the financial and economic situation of each county and city in the previous month in order to improve the province's finances.

### Cai Tingkai Appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Twelfth Army Group

â€”Has Departed from Chongqing to Guangdong to Assume Officeâ€”

General Cai Tingkai recently responded to Chiang Kai-shek's telegram to Chongqing to instruct on the military details of Guangdong Province. After arriving in Chongqing, Cai visited the chairman of the committee several times. According to accurate information, Cai was recently appointed as the deputy commander-in-chief of the Twelfth Army Group, and has departed from Chongqing to return to Guangdong. It has been found that after the Fourth Route Army was reorganized into the Twelfth Army Group, Xiang Hanping, the original deputy commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army, requested to resign, and the request has been approved. The vacancy has been vacant until now, and Cai has been appointed to succeed him.

### Shipping Special

Movie and Drama

### The News Photographer Who Escaped Death and Entered Life (Continued from Yesterday)

He said, "We were at the Maine seashore, wanting to film a novel stunt called 'balloon jumping.' The method involved attaching a dozen or more large balloons to a person, having them run a short distance with the balloons, and then jump. The balloons would lift the person up and then slowly bring them down.

'I wanted to jump over a car with the balloons. This required even more balloons. We kept adding them until there were more than thirty. I knew there were too many balloons, and I was hurrying to untie a few when a gust of wind came and blew me off the ground, higher and higher. When I reached one hundred and fifty feet, the only rope connecting me to the ground snapped. In no time, I was at fifteen hundred feet and still rising. Fortunately, a northeast wind was blowing, so I wasn't carried out to sea. I saw my partners on the ground jump into a car and start chasing me. Even more luckily, the route I was flying was parallel to the road below; otherwise, they wouldn't have been able to catch up with me.

'I rose into the clouds, unable to see the ground. I could only hear the sound of their car horns. More and more people gathered to chase me, and I kept rising, to an altitude of three thousand feet, flying into a rain cloud. Moisture condensed on the balloons, adding some weight, and I descended to twelve hundred feet. At this point, a minister among the people chasing me, who was a good marksman, got hold of a rifle and started shooting at the balloons. Thank goodness for his amazing marksmanship. He shot and burst several of the five-foot balloons tied to me, and I was able to return to the ground on solid footing. If his shooting hadn't been so accurate, those bullets could have finished me off!'"

That wasn't all. He once tied himself to the radio mast of a submarine to film the real scene of the submarine submerging. He and the people in the submarine agreed that when he made a certain hand gesture towards the periscope, the people in the submarine would raise or lower the submarine a little. First, they filmed the scene of the deck and turret disappearing into the water, which was not difficult. He made a gesture to sink further; even the periscope was below the surface of the water â€“ this was the most dangerous â€“ only the radio mast he was on was exposed above the water, and the water had reached his waist. He felt it necessary to estimate how long he could hold his breath underwater. Fortunately, the submarine surfaced, averting the tragedy of a drowned photographer. Afterwards, he told people, "I felt that was the best (and last) opportunity to film the submarine submerging."

For a newsreel photographer, climbing the steel frames of skyscrapers and the beams of iron bridges, or even the wings of airplanes in flight, for the convenience of work is not unusual. But sometimes, one can get a good opportunity to travel abroad with a diplomatic mission, like Bob Donahue of PathÃ© Industries.

At a banquet in London, the Prince of Wales, who was also the Duke of Windsor, was present, but photography was strictly forbidden. Donahue left the dining room and wrote a note to the Prince, saying, "I am a photographer specially sent by my country. It is my duty to photograph Your Highness and the diplomatic personnel of my country. I wonder if I could have the honor of your approval." He returned to the dining room and managed to place the note on the Prince of Wales's plate.

After the meal, Donahue had an opportunity to meet the Prince. He said, "I am the one who wrote that note just now. Can Your Highness allow me to?"

The Prince of Wales looked at him strangely for a moment, nodded, and invited many guests to take photographs together.

A few years later, Donahue was sent to South America to film a sound newsreel of the Prince of Wales. When he approached the Prince, the Prince asked him, "You are the one who wrote me a note in London last time, aren't you?" It seems the Prince of Wales had a good memory.

Sometimes, minor skills outside of photography can also provide great convenience in work. Barney Batchelor, a Fox Movietone newsreel photographer, once encountered this. He danced a "one-step Charleston" well and happened to meet the former King of Greece, who also liked this tune. So, on the condition of teaching him to dance, he was allowed to shoot many films. The two parties traded, satisfied and departed.

King Alfonso of Spain also served as a photographer's apprentice once. That was during a cavalry drill in Guadalajara. A Fox Movietone photographer was there to produce a newsreel. He was a small, thin man from Italy, weighing about one hundred and fifteen pounds. The weather was extremely hot, and he was carrying a camera that weighed almost as much as himself, making it hard to breathe. Alfonso saw his predicament and beckoned him to ask,

"Can your camera be disassembled?"

"Yes, Your Majesty."

So, His Majesty the Emperor carried part of the camera, and one of his ministers carried the tripod. And it seemed that His Majesty the Emperor was very interested in this work.

The photographer later said to people, "I have experienced many thrilling and strange things, but having an emperor help me carry the camera is always a great honor."

The more important the person, the more willing they are to cooperate, this is a common belief among photographers.

President Roosevelt never refused to be photographed. He also often used film terms when talking to them. After each shoot, he always liked to ask, "How about it, want to do it again?"

The wife of former President Coolidge was also a photography enthusiast. When people were taking pictures of her and her husband, she would also hold a camera and mingle among them, busying herself. Sometimes when the President walked out of the camera's range, or when one of the photographers suddenly ran out of film, the First Lady would always do her best to help. This event gave them a very good impression, and some people still remember it. President Hoover also once delayed his train for some time to allow them to take photos. These are all good examples of great men not being pretentious.

Filming some people requires a lot of effort, like when Garbo returned after touring Europe. At the same time, some people come to you. These are the starving masses. They flocked to the company, asking to be filmed in newsreels, hoping to evoke public sympathy on the screen.

Newsreels are prohibited from containing scenes with advertising properties, but the late oil tycoon Rockefeller broke the rule once. When the photographer asked the rich man to say a few words during filming, he said, "God bless, God bless everyone." Then he added, "God bless Standard Oil Company"â€”that was his business. Originally, this last sentence would have been deleted, but this time it was exceptionally preserved, so audiences everywhere could hear his blessing of his own industry.

The photographer, Hurth, who filmed the assassination attempt on President Roosevelt, coincidentally obtained all the footage at the time. However, this is something that can only be encountered by chance.

"I had already set up the lights before the President arrived," he said. "When the President arrived at nine o'clock, I had already pushed the camera into an excellent position. However, the President's car came from the opposite direction, so all I could film was a back view. So I hurried up and said to the President, 'Please turn around and take a front photo.'"

Just as he was speaking, the President turned around, and the assassin fired the gun. Anthony Cermak, who came with the President, immediately fell to the ground in response, and blood splattered on the photographer. The police immediately came up to surround the President, protecting him as he walked outside. Hurth quickly returned to the camera, and he filmed various shots of President Roosevelt going outside and the assassin being arrested. After everything calmed down, he realized how dangerous it was. At the time, the position he was standing in was in a direct line with the bullet. [To be continued]

### Re-battle and Re-win, the Chinese Federation Wins the Governor's Cup Again, the Battle Situation is Tense, Four to Five, the United Federation Wins After Losing

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday the sun seemed a little shy and often refused to show its face, but the weather was mild, which was perfect for ball players to be active.

At three forty-five in the afternoon, the great football drama rehearsed in Jia Shanâ€”the Governor's Cup finalâ€”attracted ten thousand spectators. The atmosphere was lively, and with two famous actors performing, every moment was tense and every moment was wonderful. It was truly a great drama for the eyes.

I think the overall situation had three 'mores': more changes in the battle situation, more wonderful shots, and more stimulation for the audience. During the ninety-minute competition, both sides had gains and losses, and the battle was tied seven times at a score of 1-0 (West Federation leads, Chinese Federation follows), 1-1, 2-1, 2-2, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4, 4-4. Until the last five minutes, the Chinese Federation finally gained one more goal under a fierce attack, establishing the victory.

In this battle for victory, the Western Federation took the lead in one breath, completing the work of the first half with a score of 3-2. However, the Chinese Federation was able to catch up quickly after each goal lost. Therefore, the entire battle situation underwent great changes in the tense sound of chasing. In short, this drama can be called a battle for victory or a battle of pursuit.

Yesterday I had this comment: "The Western Federation's failure to use Gaonu as center forward is really a misstep, and this kind of lineup is beneficial to the Chinese Federation. I certainly don't want to see it change again and become perfect." My meaning refers to the fact that if the Western Federation's front line adjusts Gaoshi to the center or changes again, it will be better than the original. And the facts really came true. Although Gaoshi was absent yesterday and Heshi was nowhere to be seen, it was precisely because of this that its front line was able to improve with the addition of people. The power of the attack was indeed terrible. It can be believed that its front line, if it performs according to the original full team, may not be more outstanding than this.

The most obvious factor for the victory of the Chinese Federation is that the flanking attack method is more effective than the central assault method. The two goals scored in the first half were both due to the flanks. The first goal was a wonderful pass from Guangsen, which was passed to Dehui and scored by Jingxiang. The second goal was Chengtuo's high-speed flanking attack. Gao Luda Shi could not catch it and broke free, and Jingxiang took advantage of the situation and scored a goal. According to this, it can be seen that in a competition, if you want to win, then being good at using the flanks is an indispensable strategy. However, yesterday the Chinese Federation provided very few opportunities for activity on the flanks in the first half, especially on Chengtuo's side. There was not much to show, and the focus was only on the triangular pass in the center, so there was no way to achieve results, and they had to be in a losing position first. As for the third and fifth goals scored in the second half, they were also direct and indirect contributions from the flanks. The first and fourth goals scored by the Western Federation were also due to the flanks.

The Chinese Federation's front line scored five goals, while the rear lost four goals. The distinction between this success and dereliction of duty is very clear. Therefore, the merits and demerits of each guard must be discussed. In my opinion, Jingcheng worked hard in this game, but he could not stop Ambarson's activity. As a result of Am's invasion, the Chinese Federation was in danger. Shaohan's foot injury was not completely healed before he went into battle. His football strength was weak, and his performance was mediocre. Rongying lost a move in the battle with Dixon in the middle. Therefore, there were quite a few flaws in the defense of the three. In addition, the Western Federation's front-line contact was good, attacking from the left and suddenly attacking from the right. The central road was also often threatened, so Jingcheng and Lingsheng did not dare to launch a light attack. However, Lingsheng's attack was very good and was the most outstanding member of the rear. Although Tiansheng often used skill to deceive people, the loss of the fourth goal was the effect of his cleverness backfiring. Rongcai, except for the loss of three goals, was because his observation was slightly lacking in agility. In addition, he was not bad, but since he was newly appointed to this important task, he inevitably showed a little nervousness in his attitude.

I also saw that the supply from the Chinese Federation's front line to the forwards was very small. However, there were more opportunities to find their own way. However, it was not that the forwards did not want to provide more supply. Unfortunately, the rapid invasion of the Western Federation's forwards was too scary, so they still felt that the defense was not enough. Therefore, there were very few attacks and supplies across the midfield. On the other hand, the Western Federation's Dixon, because of the strong cover, could often see the style of attacking with the ball. However, the reason for the Western Federation's defeat also seemed to be in this point. Because Dixon often went out far, Parker and Filswater could not help but come forward at the same time to provide supplies. However, they were completely focused on the attack, and they inevitably neglected defense. Once the Chinese Federation's front line found a way out, they immediately launched a surprise attack, and it was common to see Dixon unable to save in time. Therefore, most of the five goals lost were based on this reason. From this, it can be seen that there are both advantages and disadvantages to the forwards attacking.

In terms of the strength of both sides, the Chinese Federation was originally richer, and it was the result that they should have won the final victory. However, because they could not use the flanks for passing and flanking attacks at the beginning, the progress was difficult and they were trapped in a hard battle. If they had used this move earlier, they might not have been in a precarious situation at all times, and only won the victory in the last nine minutes.

Within ten minutes after the start of the game, the Chinese Federation had a strong momentum, and the five forwards often ravaged the opponent's hinterland, but to no avail because the Western Federation's guards were well-trained.

At fifteen minutes, the Western Federation worked hard and launched a fierce attack. Finally, Ambarson forced a corner kick. The kick was wonderful. Gurney welcomed the ball with a header and opened the record first.

At sixteen minutes, the Chinese Federation took advantage of the kick-off and launched an overwhelming general offensive. All that was seen in the smoke and dust was that Dehui passed the ball to Jingxiang, and Jingxiang swept the ball into the net in the crowd. 1-1, the first time the score was tied.

At twenty-six minutes, Liao Yachen made a sneak attack on the frontier, cutting it just right. George intercepted it and sent it away. Gurney arrived just in time and shot from 20 yards away. Rongcai could not touch it. At this point, the Chinese Federation lost another goal.

At thirty-four minutes, Zhaorong passed the ball to the left, and Chengtuo advanced rapidly alone, dodging Billyburn, and then shooting. The ball was patted out by Golluders. Jingxiang arrived in time and added a kick. The ball went straight into the net. 2-2, the score was tied again, and the tense situation can also be imagined.

At thirty-nine minutes, Tiansheng and Gurney fought each other. The ball was obtained by Dixon, who fired a cold arrow 30 yards from the goal. Rongcai did not expect this, and lost another goal. 3-1, the first half was over.

At thirteen minutes of the second half, Chengtuo copied the border and passed it beautifully. Dehui ambushed under the city and jumped high for a header. Sure enough, he scored. Golluders could not save him. 3-3, the score was not yet divided. The fans in the stands watched with fascination.

At eighteen minutes, Jingxiang got the ball, opened up a path, and made a short pass forward. Zhaorong and Dehui became a double sprint. Wurich and Billyburn could not stop them, and Dehui shot in one. 4-3, the Chinese Federation reversed the situation and won.

At twenty-six minutes, the Western Federation's Ambarson broke through several barriers in a row and handed the ball to Gurney. Tiansheng rushed forward and entangled him. Gurney passed the ball on the baseline, and Kendy rushed towards the ball. It was difficult for even the gods to teach him, so it became 4-4, and the Western Federation returned the color to the Chinese Federation. At this point in the battle, the wonderfulness was fully displayed.

At forty-five minutes, Dehui quickly robbed the ball and sent it to Zhaorong. Zhaorong dodged the guards. At this time, Wurich and others rushed forward to block him. Zhaorong was resourceful. Instead of shooting, he handed the ball to Guangsen, who took advantage of the emptiness and entered. He shot into the corner of the goal, creating a 5-4 victory. After the war was over, the Governor of Hong Kong presided over the award ceremony. In addition to keeping the shining silver Governor's Cup for one year, each player also received a small silver cup. After three cheers, they went down the mountain together.

### Nanhua Club Friendly Singles Tennis Final: Chen Zhiqiang Wins Against Huang Funan; Huang Has Enough Experience, But Lacks Endurance

The friendly singles and doubles tennis tournament organized by the tennis section of the Nanhua Sports Association held the final match between Chen Zhiqiang and Huang Funan at 3 p.m. yesterday at the club's Royal Garden court. As a result, Chen won three to zero and won the championship. Mrs. Cai Dongsheng awarded the prizes afterward at around 4 p.m., and the meeting was adjourned. Chen is brave and good at fighting, running around the whole court without any tiredness. He is especially good at high chops and cuts, and his forehand and backhand shots are also very powerful. Therefore, it did not take much effort for him to win three sets straight. Although Huang has rich experience, he could not do anything about it. Huang is a well-known athlete who has participated in the Hong Kong Open Grass Tournament for many years. His skills have improved a lot. Although he has not reached the point of perfection, his experience is rich, which is something Chen cannot match. Therefore, his loss yesterday was due to lack of endurance and inability to fight for a long time. At the same time, the baseline shots were inaccurate, with frequent mistakes, giving people opportunities. If he did not have rich experience, there would be no room for struggle. In the first set, Chen's momentum was fierce, and he attacked desperately, winning 6-3 first. In the second set, Huang had an advantage, but eventually lost again 5-7 due to lack of stamina. At the beginning of the first set, both sides thought it was the final stage, and the number of wins and losses was at stake, so they all worked hard. Therefore, at the beginning, both sides were in a stalemate, but Huang eventually lost again 4-6 due to lack of stamina. The results were 6-3, 7-5, 6-4. The rankings of each item are also recorded below: Singles champion: Chen Zhiqiang, runner-up: Huang Funan, singles handicap champion: Wu Jinda, runner-up: Zhang Guansheng, doubles champion: Chen Zhiqiang, Lu Guifen, runner-up: Huang Funan, Chen Mianman, doubles handicap champion: Huang Zhichi, Wu Jinda, runner-up: Li Junhong, Ye Guanming

### Keyi Middle School Team's Tour of Macau (3)

â€” Liu Dianguang

I woke up the earliest the next morning and, together with Comrade Zhang from the First War Zone, took a car we had brought to inspect the outskirts of Tangjia outside the Barrier Gate. In the distance, we could see the land near the sea, where many important fortifications had been built. In the fields and hills we passed, there were many young guerrillas rich in the struggle for national liberation. The walls were covered with slogans of the "Anti-Ã— Comrades Association." Each guerrilla team had a simple and solemn spirit, which was admirable. On the way, I talked with Comrade Zhang about the people who should have fought but didn't, and those who turned their guns and fled. We both sighed. When we returned to Macau, it was already 9:45. All the comrades were waiting for lunch at Lin's residence. After breakfast, we rested for 45 minutes and did 15 minutes of calisthenics. When it was 10:00, everyone was free to act. We decided to leave at 2:00 p.m. I then visited Principal Chongshi Yan Ming with Principal Chen. Principal Liang has a long history in Macau. He is not only a famous educator, but also an old revolutionary. At twelve o'clock, we were invited to lunch, and among those seated with us were reporters Zhao, Huang, and Lei, as well as Principal Liang's attendants. Their sincerity will never be forgotten. When it was almost time, we shook hands and made an appointment to meet again. At 1:30, Principal Chen ordered a general mobilization and personally supervised the army. Military advisors Tang Linghan and Hu Zhenbiao had already arranged the battle array. The whole team marched out in full armor towards the new port. Military advisor Hu was suffering from skin problems, so he followed in a rickshaw. In an instant, we had reached our destination. The barracks beside the mountain played music to welcome us.

### Reverie in Teaching

â€” Huang Kaiyin

The moment I stepped into the church, I immediately felt a sense of low pressure, and I couldn't help but piously make the sign of the cross on my chest. I held my breath, endured the sound of my feet, and occasionally coughed, and felt ashamed as if I had committed something.

The stained-glass lamp formed a golden fire flower. Standing in the church was the Virgin Mary holding the infant, her expression transcendent, her face radiating a holy and inviolable light. To the side was Christ nailed to the cross, the blood flowing from the nail wounds in his hands and feet already congealed. His tightly locked brows made one feel as if they were experiencing his pain, and thereby feel his greatness. The superb nature of religious art may be one of the important reasons for its irresistible mystery, right? As an atheist, I had to bow here and fall into deep thought.

Sunlight crawled in from the round windows inlaid with yellow, blue, or green colored glass, hanging on the milky white wall, and thus became thousands of auspicious lights, making the room bright and beautiful. The deep yellow door was always open, even though the key was always left in the lock, ready for anyone who was weary of life to come here to confess and pray, with two cold tear streaks on their face. Come on, those standing outside the door! Saint Mary will caress you and forgive your mistakes. Someone dressed in a black robe, shining with silver, will say so.

Let's go outside the door for a tour of the scenery. The landscape is picturesque, the sun is bright, and it is a rare weather in winter. A pillow chair is placed next to the stone railing in front of the steps, so the entire view of the narrow island is clear. This is because the church is built on top of a small hill. When ships return from overseas, and the outline of the peninsula is vaguely visible, the first thing that catches the eye is often this golden-topped building. What a lighthouse on the sea, and don't the bishops and priests who live in the church feel lonely like lighthouse keepers? A huge black dog came wagging its tail. I teased it, and it intimately lowered its head and lay on my knees. It is such a docile creature, and probably also tasted the sorrow of loneliness, and craved someone's company, right?

Below is the boundless sea and the buildings piled up like children's toys. It is already winter, and the leaves are still so tenderly green. The sea is calm, and the waves gently lean towards the shore. I unconsciously have fallen into a landscape painting. According to my past temperament, I would often be unable to help but sing loudly, just as someone said: "Who doesn't want to let out a long sigh of emotion when climbing to the top"? And I even presumptuously had the intention of looking down on everything. But what time is it now, and what place is this? You are so willing to forget yourself; have you long forgotten the fragrance that fills the fields, the pastoral emotions of the pastoral? Look at the end of Dongwangyang connected to the foot of the mountain, the endless land, with a little difference in distance, aren't the people living there like they are in two different worlds? Yes, yes. I was wrong! Thank you for your instructions, so that I don't go to the maze. Alas, how can I forget the familiar fields?

There are many barren, primitive islands nearby. It seems that apart from decorating the simple sea, there is really nothing to them. However, isn't the place where I am standing also a place of rugged mountains and thorny roads? After a hundred years, it has already possessed the scale of a modern city, not to mention that it has now become our place of survival, retaining a life. I can't help but admire the greatness of human power. The sky is vast and quiet. Vaguely watching the passing clouds, I felt waves of thought. When the electric clock on the top of the church suddenly struck six times, a ship from Hong Kong slowly sailed into the harbor, and dusk had quietly stood in front of me.

### The Fate of Japanese Women

â€” Feima

We all know that Japanese women are very affectionate and serve their husbands very well. However, because the constitution of this capitalist society of Japan still contains a strong feudal flavor, we can say that the affection of Japanese women is precisely the fatal tragedy of Japanese women.

Hollywood movie companies in the United States once seized on the affection of Japanese women and filmed a new, sad and beautiful film called "Madame Butterfly." Those who have seen that film may feel a kind of yearning for Japanese women. It's not so much wanting such a woman to be considerate and serve, but feeling that if there really is such a woman's love in the world, and if men didn't play with women like that American sailor, then it would be a sweet world!

But this is ultimately an ideal. Precisely because Japanese women are excessively affectionate, Japanese women are even more tragic. Since the War of Resistance, whenever we see Japanese women writing letters to their husbands who are engaged in the war of aggression in China in the newspapers, no matter how biased a patriot we are, we always feel how tragic Japanese women are!

During the "January 28th" incident, the Japanese once organized "Comfort Groups." During this "August 13th" incident, because of the strict news blockade in Japan, although we have not seen any news about Japanese women, we can imagine that facts that are even more tragic than the "Comfort Groups" must be performing a lot in Japan. Not long ago, in Shanghai, two Japanese soldiers committed suicide because their wives became prostitutes in Shanghai to "comfort" the soldiers fighting in China!

The fate of Japanese women is so tragic to this point. But there are even more tragic things. As yesterday's newspaper carried a news report from Tokyo: it said that the Japanese government recently stated that the number of soldiers who died in China was extremely large, and the number of widows left in the country was increasing. The issue of pensions has become a major economic burden for the country. Now, in order to reduce this heavy burden, it is planned to send 30,000 widows to South America, Brazil, after giving them four months of colonial training. Because there are 200,000 Japanese immigrants in Brazil, and many of them are unmarried, they can accommodate this batch of widows. It is also reported that the Japanese Colonial Ministry is also planning to send a large number of widows to "Manchukuo." The request for an annual expenditure of 170,000 yuan was made at the budget session of the Diet a few days ago to provide for the resettlement of widows.

I copied the above news, not to object to or oppose the remarriage of widows, but to feel that such a relocation of widows only increases the tragic fate of Japanese women, which is something everyone can imagine! Why? Because this relocation contains the meaning of aggression!

So how can the fate of Japanese women be improved? Of course, Japanese women need to consider it themselves, but the day when China's War of Resistance finally wins is also the day when Japanese women escape that tragic "relocation" fate!

### In Memory of Nameless Heroes

â€” Wang Ye

Before your nameless tomb,

I offer a small wreath,

Your ardent blood once spilled across the motherland's garden;

Your soul also strived for freedom.

Dear one, here â€” may be the battlefield,

You smile and rest well;

Your comrades are still fighting on the front lines.

Dear one, here â€” may be the battlefield,

You smile and rest wellâ€”

Ah! In a little while â€” friends,

I will deliver to you the news of victory.

### The Extraordinary Romance of Double Phoenixes

â€” Zou Xiao

â€”â€”On National Novels

"The Extraordinary Romance of Double Phoenixes" is a novel based on the story of Zhaojun's marriage to the Xiongnu. There are indeed too many works of art about Wang Zhaojun. Taking Hu Danfeng's "Chronicles of the Green Tomb" as an example, there are more than four hundred poems praising Wang Zhaojun. In terms of popular literature, there is the "Biography of the Bright Consort." In terms of drama, there are also four kinds of Yuan Zaju plays: Ma Zhiyuan's "Autumn in the Han Palace," Guan Hanqing's "Zhaojun Cries," Zhang Shiqi's "Zhaojun Departs the Border," and Wu Changling's "Zhaojun Walks in the Moonlight." Unfortunately, all but "Autumn in the Han Palace" have been lost. Ming and Qing legends include "Records of Making Peace" and "Records of the Green Tomb," as well as Zhou Wenchuan's "The Pipa's Words." Ming and Qing miscellaneous dramas include Chen Yujiao's "Zhaojun Departs the Border" (included in the first collection of Sheng Ming miscellaneous dramas, mistakenly attributed to Zhang Gong's "Wang Zhaojun" instead of "Records of Making Peace," see Lingnan Journal, Volume 2, Number 2), You Tong's "Lamenting the Pipa," and Xue Dan's "Zhaojun's Dream." The latter two are included in "Newly Compiled Miscellaneous Dramas," and Zhen Duo discovered the complete collection of "New Compilation" the year before last. Zhang Shoulin's "Points and Drops in the Evolution of the Story of Wang Zhaojun" (Literary Annual of Yenching University, Issue 1) and Huang Qixiu's "The Evolution of the Story of Wang Zhaojun" (Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University Folklore Weekly, Issues 121 and 122) have listed all of the above dramas. However, the latest "Romance of Double Phoenixes" legend seems to have been omitted by all. Yushuangyi has a manuscript copy of this legend. Du Yingtao's "Notes on Manuscript Operas Collected by Yushuangyi" in the Journal of Dramatic Studies says: "The Romance of Double Phoenixes," one volume, not divided into chapters, author's name recorded in red, performs the story of Wang Zhaojun, the same as the popular "The Extraordinary Romance of Double Phoenixes" novel. Originally, it consisted of two volumes, upper and lower. This copy only contains the upper volume, a total of twenty scenes, ending with Li Ling copying and executing Mao Yan's family. The lower volume is missing." It is likely that this drama was compiled after "The Extraordinary Romance of Double Phoenixes."

It seems that "The Extraordinary Romance of Double Phoenixes" is the only novel version. Sun Kaidi's "Catalog of Chinese Popular Novels" is lost, consisting of eighty chapters. Zhang Shoulin believes it was published in the mid-Qing Dynasty and has a popular edition. This book mostly takes from "Autumn in the Han Palace," "Records of Making Peace," and "Chronicles of the Green Tomb" and slightly alters them. "For example, in Autumn in the Han Palace, Zhaojun plays the pipa, and Emperor Yuan hears it," thus gaining favor. In the novel, it is changed to being heard by Empress Lin, who then tells Emperor Yuan, adding another layer of complication. A line in Autumn in the Han Palace says: "A flaw mars this inch of autumnal wave of her eyes." The novel says: "A small black mole is drawn under each eye in every picture."

Records of Making Peace says that Zhaojun draws her own portrait, and the novel agrees. Records of Making Peace says that the official Su Shanyin replaces Zhaojun in marriage, and the novel agrees, but there is no name for the palace maid. Records of Making Peace writes of Zhaojun appearing in Emperor Yuan's dream after her death, asking him to take her younger sister, Wang Xiuzhen, and the novel agrees, only changing Wang Xiuzhen's name to Sai Zhaojun.

Currently, only two scenes, "Departing the Border" and "Sending Zhaojun," remain from Chronicles of the Green Tomb. Recently, Zhu Chuanming and Hua Chuanhao of the Xiandian Society have performed it several times, with very good dance movements. This drama features the imperial brother Wang Long sending Zhaojun off, and the novel also follows this idea, only changing Wang Long to Liu Wen (the same name as the main character in "Visiting the Grave").

In this way, the novel "The Extraordinary Romance of Double Phoenixes" can be said to be a compilation of legends.

### Li Changren (Continued)

â€” Li Tian

The sun had long set below the mountains, and the earth was now ruled by the god of night. Anxious to leave this oppressive and dangerous area, the two of them had no choice but to grope their way forward through the pitch-black night. The rugged mountain roads, the muddy riverbanks, whether there were * people ahead, whether there were bandits behind them â€“ they had no time to consider any of it, only to speed up their pace.

Estimating the distance they had run, it was about three in the morning. They arrived at a place where a very high earthen embankment blocked their path. From the darkness, with no moonlight but only a few faint stars, they could vaguely see that this embankment was not only twenty or thirty feet high but also seemed to stretch endlessly on both sides.

"Eh! The front * is probably a trench, right? We have to be careful going up!" He warned the messenger.

The slope of the embankment was about sixty degrees. After much struggling to climb and fall, they finally reached the top of the earthen embankment. But the moment their toes stepped up, they touched two parallel railroad tracks. Along with the gusts of southeast wind, the sounds of distant groans drifted to their ears. Li Changren stretched his long waist, his hair standing on end a little. Unexpectedly, as they were carefully walking, three stiff corpses were strewn beside the road, a little more than ten feet ahead. Two 79 rifles were thrown on the ground. Without hesitation, they picked up the two rifles and continued to move forward.

A train station was ahead, and they could vaguely recognize it. They walked to the stone plaque with the station name, but because of the dim light, they could not make out the words on the plaque. Fortunately, he had the advantage of his tall stature. He forcefully raised his heels and desperately raised his arms. At the same time, he used the sense of touch of his fingers and finally made out the three words "Jishan Station."

"Ah, Jishan, that's not far from the * village where my relatives live." In the faint starlight, the messenger could see some relief appearing on Li Yin's face. In order to determine the direction of the * village, they finally relied on the distant barking of dogs to explore their way forward. But because they had increased the weight of the guns on their backs, their speed was inevitably slower than before.

They entered the village and arrived at the home of his relatives. After changing into local clothes and eating a comfortable meal, they had a chance to rest temporarily. The east was about to turn white.

The sun shone in through the window. As soon as he got out of bed, the sounds of gunfire came from outside the village. The villagers cried out in panic, "The * people are coming!" Then they took the old and the young and fled in a panic toward the back road of the village. Li Changren mixed in with the crowd and left the village. He arrived at the foot of a tree on a hill on the other side of the river and was resting there when the messenger had long since disappeared. As he was still in shock, he looked back and saw that the roofs of the * village were quickly being engulfed in plumes of white and black smoke, and in a little while, the entire sky was stained red!

As he was about to step across a small river more than ten feet wide, a team of horses with strange and harsh noises galloped up from behind. Li Yin knew it was unavoidable and was forced to pretend to be carrying his back and walk faster, mixed in with the fleeing villagers.

"Hey! Hey..." Their hurried footsteps were stopped by the * soldiers who were close behind.

Forced to turn their heads, their faces pale and white, they looked up and saw a large group of * soldiers on horseback holding rifles. They were shouting something, their hands frantically pointing forward and then suddenly pointing backward. Li Changren and the refugees could only stare at them blankly.

Perhaps the * soldiers understood the barrier between their languages. Two of them jumped down from their horses and busily took out notebooks and pencils from their pockets and wrote:

"Are there Chinese soldiers here?"

Li Changren examined their attitude. It did not seem that they intended to do evil to him personally, and their expressions showed a considerable degree of panic. Li Changren frowned and thought clearly in his mind, intending to try his empty city strategy.

"Yes," he mustered his courage, snatched the pen from the * soldier's hand, and replied to them.

"How many?"

"Many," Li Changren further probed him.

Sure enough, upon seeing such a reply, these two * soldiers immediately increased their level of panic and shouted:

"Many? Many! Very many? Many..."

The * soldiers behind him were attracted by the tense expressions of the two men and jumped down from their horses one after another. Five or six hands pointed to Li Wei's "many" in unison. Everyone's faces were covered with an expression of panic and doubt, and they asked in unison:

"Many? Many? Many..."

Li Changren's heart changed from fear to complacency. He deduced that his plan had been successful and that he had taken the initiative. But in a flash of thought, in order to avoid being entangled by the * soldiers, he planned his second escape plan, and he wrote again:

"That was yesterday."

"Ah! Yesterday!" The * soldiers cheered as if they had been relieved of a heavy burden.

"Where are they now?" A * soldier who spoke Chinese with about five or six points of accuracy rushed to ask.

"Toward that way," Li Changren randomly pointed to the left and said.

"Ah..." They shouted wildly in a mix of satisfaction, each of them mounted their horses and galloped off to Li Changren's right.

The hooves of the * soldiers' horses gradually disappeared in the dust in front of them. The refugees standing behind Li Changren, who had been frightened to the point of turning pale, breathed a sigh of relief, on the one hand, despising the * soldiers' cowardice, and on the other hand, admiring Li Changren's wit.

On his lonely journey, in his crazy wandering, one day, he finally arrived at his unit, at the original garrison location before being ordered to move out â€“ * * village, Panyu County â€“ He hurriedly ran into the usually most prosperous street in the village, but now he could not find half a person. Only many hungry cats and stray dogs in the streets and alleys were howling wildly, welcoming the man who had wandered from afar. (The End)
