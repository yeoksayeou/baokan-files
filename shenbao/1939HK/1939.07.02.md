### Concerning the Evacuation of Capital from Shanghai

— Wu Zejin

The ever-increasing prices in Shanghai have become the most serious phenomenon here. This publication has previously earnestly requested scholars and experts to discuss in detail the reasons for this and methods to stabilize the situation. Many gentlemen have expressed insightful opinions, but it seems that few have offered concrete and practical suggestions and methods.

In my opinion, the rising prices in Shanghai are due to many factors, such as reduced production, reduced supply, concentrated population, and the establishment of a black market for foreign exchange. However, in addition to these reasons, the significant expansion of currency in circulation in Shanghai is undoubtedly one of the main reasons for the rising prices. In the previous symposium, some gentlemen, especially Mr. Guangdi, said that "the amount of currency in circulation in Shanghai after the war is not only less than before the war, but also seems to be tighter." This may refer to the situation just after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, but since the National Army withdrew westward, the wealthy from all over the country have concentrated in Shanghai. Along with them came large amounts of capital. The sharp increase in bank deposits after the war and the current atmosphere of optimism and speculation in the market are clear evidence of this. Because the capital is concentrated in one area, it has created the current special prosperity, which is also the cause of the current high prices. Therefore, to stabilize prices, in addition to studying and dealing with the other reasons mentioned above, it seems that more effort should be put into how to properly evacuate the surplus capital concentrated in Shanghai. As for the methods of evacuation, I see two points:

First, the government should issue a short-term financial treasury bond designed to regulate Shanghai's finances, authorizing the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong to approve its implementation. The four banks should, in addition to the currency in circulation actually needed in Shanghai, try to use this treasury bond to absorb general floating capital as much as possible. This method is not new. In 1934, Britain also used this method to solve its financial surplus panic at that time. However, in present-day Shanghai, this method has difficulties. First, because Shanghai is an occupied area, although there are concessions, it is questionable whether the environment allows the public promotion of government bonds. Second, the promotion of large amounts of bonds can easily cause misunderstandings among the people and doubts about legal tender.

Second, various banks should organize a large-scale banking syndicate to encourage and absorb the capital of general wealthy people, making planned internal transfers. This capital should be guaranteed by the banks with a corresponding interest rate for a considerable period of time. At the same time, the government should also guarantee the interests of the banks. This method can arouse the interest of general asset holders in investing in the interior. Because in the past, their capital would rather stay in Shanghai than move inland, mainly due to their ignorance and uncertainty about the interior. Now that the banks guarantee the interests, they will definitely be happy to help. At the same time, the government guarantees the banks, so it is beneficial and harmless to them.

In addition, such measures as Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong raising the interest rate on interbank deposits to absorb interbank idle capital, various banks raising the interest rate on fixed deposits to reduce the current nature of demand deposits, and refusing to lend funds to general speculators and manipulators are also quite capable of reducing floating capital and stabilizing prices.

The above points are just my humble opinions and cannot be regarded as suggestions. I hope that those who pay attention to the issue of Shanghai's capital will have another detailed discussion and study. This is just for reference.

### A Week in World Trends From June 25th to July 1st, 1939

— Gong Zhao

The great war of resistance of the Chinese nation is almost two full years old. In order to solve the crisis of total collapse caused by its military invasion of China, Japan is looking for solutions in the occupied areas of China, in our domestic capital, and internationally. Thus, there is the recent intensification of the coastal and northwest battles, the activities of Wang Ni and his chorus of echoers, and the Anglo-Japanese conflict and Anglo-Japanese negotiations. All of this is something we cannot ignore.

Like our country, the old British Empire is also threatened by invaders, and the situation is even more serious than in our country. However, its policies to deal with the invasion and their implementation are not as firm and rapid as ours. Therefore, the negotiations with the Soviet Union for mutual assistance have not yet yielded results, and it is constantly putting itself in unfavorable positions with Japan and Germany. In the East, the Tianjin incident is becoming increasingly serious, and the entire Far East power is in danger of being expelled. In the West, the situation in Danzig is extremely tight, and the guarantee to Poland has reached the point where it is forced to be fulfilled.

Now, let's try to give a brief report on the international situation in the past week:

(1) A Bird's-Eye View of the Overall Situation is Quite Optimistic. We Must Be Vigilant Against the Enemy's Conspiracy

Although important cities have fallen one after another and compatriots all over the country have suffered in China's two-year war of resistance, Japan's attempts to "subdue without fighting," "quick battle and quick decision," and "quick peace and quick settlement" have been completely shattered. Moreover, more than one million soldiers have been killed or injured, and military expenditures have consumed several million. Japan's feet are sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of invading China, while we are gradually eliminating corrupt elements and new forces are gradually growing. The shackles of long-term enslavement have been broken, and the dawn of final victory has been revealed. We feel infinite excitement when we take a bird's-eye view of the overall situation of the war of resistance.

At present, Japan has encountered major difficulties militarily and has to place the focus of its invasion of China on politics, with military affairs as a supplement. Therefore, Japan's future military strategy for invading China is to implement "using war to support war," focusing on consolidating the occupied areas, using China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support the military and prepare for war, and seizing the opportunity to conquer our entire country. In recent days, although the war of invading China has become more intense on all fronts on the surface, especially the coastal situation in Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces, the daily intensity has increased. Japan landed in Shantou on June 23, captured Chao'an on June 27, and Dinghai Island on the coast of eastern Zhejiang also fell on June 23. The Japanese army is also actively deploying to attack Fuzhou and Wenzhou; Yuhuan Kantou was forced to abandon on June 28. However, the deployment of these offensives by Japan, in addition to mainly destroying British business in South China and intimidating Britain, the military significance is only to consolidate its occupied areas in eastern China.

At the same time, our various front lines and the rear of the Japanese army have made considerable progress. First, the heroes of Zhongtiao Mountain in Shanxi have broken the Japanese army's seven attacks in late June, captured Yuanqu on the 25th and Fuluo on the 26th. More than 20,000 Japanese troops who invaded south were annihilated by more than 2,000 in a few days. Secondly, our army in northern Guangdong achieved a victory in the counterattack. On the 28th, a unit rushed into the Longyandong Yantang Shahe area on the outskirts of Guangzhou. In addition, considerable gains have been made in the fierce battles in Yixing on the eastern front and in various parts of southern Shandong.

However, at present, while consolidating the occupied areas and using war to support war, Japan is taking a posture of focusing on attacking Shanxi and Shaanxi, actually coordinating with political conspiracies to undermine our active, comprehensive, and protracted war. Therefore, we cannot privately rejoice in the temporary safety of a corner of the southwest, and we must actively and comprehensively launch an offensive to break Japan's conspiracy to use war to support war.

(2) Wang Ni Runs Around North and South to Sell Out the Country. The Name of the Puppet New Government is Determined

We already know that Japan's invasion of China has fallen into extreme difficulties and crises, and Japan's own strength cannot solve these difficulties and crises. Therefore, it is urgently seeking to strengthen the rule of the occupied areas in order to intensify the use of China's manpower, material resources, and financial resources to solve its difficulties and crises, increase its combat effectiveness, and divide our war of resistance forces in order to conquer our entire country.

Wang Jingwei's betrayal and his proposition and activities of "anti-Chiang, anti-Communist, and anti-war of resistance" have become the most appropriate tool for Japan.

This week, Wang Ni and his wife have been running around the north and south, preparing for Japan to establish a puppet new government on the occasion of the second anniversary of the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, in order to unify and strengthen Japan's rule over the occupied areas. According to Reuters, the puppet new government will be named the "National Government," and its ruling scope will include all occupied areas south of the Longhai Line in South China. It will potentially use the Qingquan White Sun national flag with a five-color flag in the lower corner as the puppet national flag. The puppet temporary government in Beiping will continue to maintain itself on a semi-independent principle, and will announce that all Kuomintang members who oppose Chiang Kai-shek are allowed to operate in the territory of the "National" government, and the Japanese military will train troops for the puppet new government.

Wang Jingwei is thus acting as a dog for Japan in name and in fact. It is not surprising that traitors become traitors. It is also not unexpected that the puppet new government may not be able to survive safely due to internal disputes between the Japanese and Chinese traitors and the development of our battles behind the enemy lines. What we currently consider serious: First, the Japanese, Wang Ni, etc. may further put on a political trick, such as "appeasing" the occupied areas and "withdrawing troops from Guangzhou," etc. Second, some of the people who value private and temporary rights above the interests of the country and the nation are expressing their agreement with a part of Wang Ni's proposition in words and in facts, which is precisely what Japan and Wang Ni are aiming at in dividing us. We still need everyone to be more vigilant and increase our self-confidence!

(3) Britain and Japan Prepare for Tokyo Talks. Our Country Calls on the Powers to Be Vigilant

In order to solve the current difficulties and crises, in addition to coordinating with the above-mentioned military and political conspiracies, Japan also has a policy of intimidating Britain. The purpose of this strategy is (1) to destroy and forcibly seize all the interests and properties of Britain in China in order to monopolize the "development" of its occupied areas, and (2) to induce Britain to compromise with Japan and jointly pressure our country to surrender to Japan. The steps for the implementation of this strategy are (1) to blockade the British concession in Tianjin, forcibly occupy Shantou Chao'an Dinghai, and cut off foreign trade in Fuzhou and Wenzhou, using these to threaten Britain, (2) to intensify the provocation against the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia. For the past week, the situation on the Soviet-Mongolian border has been extremely serious. This is to induce Britain and at the same time can promote its Western and Italian allies to settle down and immediately take action to form an alliance with Britain from the West, (3) After the above steps have been carried out, Xinjin agreed to hold Tokyo talks and attempted to expand the scope, that is, the talks are not limited to the Tianjin incident, but also involve the basic problem of the entire Anglo-Japanese national relations, that is, attempting to turn Tokyo into Munich, inducing the British government to cooperate with Japan to subdue our country, and then driving out all British forces in the Far East.

Our Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui immediately broadcast to Europe on the 28th, pointing out that Japan's aggression is endless, and attempting to compromise is seeking skin from a tiger, which not only cannot solve the Far East crisis, but also leads to further demands. Our Ambassador to the United Kingdom Gu Weijun also delivered a speech earlier on the 28th, denouncing Japan's aggression, which not only destroys China's territorial sovereignty, but also when China is swallowed up, the interests of foreign countries in the Far East will inevitably not be spared. This kind of warning naturally has a considerable impact on the international community. Political circles in London have expressed that "Britain does not intend to change its established policy on the Far East issue." However, we must recognize that we want to strive for foreign aid, but not rely on it. What we rely on is self-reliance and the mobilization of all the people. Only by relying on the people, adhering to unity and war of resistance, and breaking all the conspiracies of the enemy can we not be shaken by changes in external forces, just like a swimmer who is not drowned by water.

(4) Germany Continues to Conspire to Annex Danzig. The British Foreign Secretary Makes His First Lion's Roar

As mentioned earlier, Japan's threat to Britain has international significance. Sure enough, just like the collapse of the copper drum in the west, the Luozhong bell responded in the east, Japan's Western ally, Germany, has also launched in Europe! Danzig is in danger! Danzig is in danger! These big words have appeared in world newspapers again.

The Free City of Danzig is the lifeline of Poland's 35 million people. It is not only Poland's only port of intake and output economically, but also a crucial link that determines Poland's fate militarily and politically. At the same time, from Germany's point of view, Danzig is a corridor for attacking northeastern Europe. Therefore, taking this corridor first has long been set in Hitler's second step of attack plan.

However, since Poland has repeatedly and resolutely stated that it will never allow Danzig to be annexed by Germany, and Britain has recently solemnly announced its guarantee of Poland's security, Germany's current actions will be the last test of British diplomacy!

Now, Germany's conspiracy to annex Danzig is becoming more urgent, and 4,000 German troops have sneaked into Danzig on the evening of the 28th. The Polish side believes that the situation is serious and has actively prepared for both land and sea to implement new deployments. What about Britain? British Foreign Secretary Halifax made a "first tough" speech on the 29th, saying, "If there is another act of aggression, we will use all our strength to fulfill our oath of resistance!" This is an unprecedentedly clear declaration! However, enlightened politicians such as Eden and Churchill in the British side have long suspected the sincerity of Britain in fulfilling its promise to resist aggression. They have all said that "It is difficult for Britain and France to fulfill their promise to guarantee Poland without the help of the Soviet Union," and where is the sincerity of Britain's negotiations with the Soviet Union?

(5) The Peace Front Has Made Some Progress. Friendship Between China, the Soviet Union, and France Has Increased

Speaking of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, they have been full of twists and turns, almost causing headaches. Soviet Member Zhidanov said it well: "This is enough to prove that Britain and France do not want to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union on the principle of equality. Britain and France actually want to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union in which the Soviet Union unilaterally does all the work and bears all the responsibilities; however, such a treaty cannot be signed by a self-respecting country unless it wants to become a toy. The Soviet Union's military strength and dignity have always been recognized by the world. How can it sign such a treaty?"

However, the international situation can no longer allow the democratic and peaceful countries to continue dreaming! Therefore, the movement to maintain peace and oppose aggression has made considerable progress this week! The main ones are:

(1) China and the Soviet Union signed a trade treaty on June 16. This treaty is completely based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and at this time when all the ports in southeastern China are blocked, its assistance to the war of resistance and national construction is naturally particularly significant. The Soviet Union's sincere friendship with us can naturally serve as a model for other countries.

(2) The Chinese-French credit loan, totaling 1.5 million pounds, is said to have been established on June 22, which also provides important assistance to the development of the Far East peace front.

(3) The Anglo-French consultation meeting on joint defense in the Far East in Singapore ended successfully on June 25. The detailed internal investigation is still kept secret. What has been announced is that Britain and France have decided on wartime cooperation methods and maintain close contact with the United States.

(4) The Anglo-American raw material barter agreement was signed on June 23.

(5) The Anglo-Polish military agreement has been drafted and will be signed soon.

(6) The Anglo-Romanian financial negotiations have reached an agreement on June 24.

(7) The agreement on the joint guarantee of Mediterranean security between France and Turkey was officially signed on June 23.

(8) The new joint defense of the Balkan countries is actively being prepared.

(9) The United States' attitude towards Japanese exclusion is gradually becoming stronger (Central News Agency Washington, 23rd) American political circles are enthusiastically discussing the embargo on arms to Japan (same as above, 24th)

Finally, speaking of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, according to the Central News Agency's telegram from London on the 29th, the British government, in view of the urgency of the situation, has prepared to "accept all" of the Soviet Union's proposals and instructed its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Xici, to grant full power and establish an agreement as soon as possible. The angry tide of anti-aggression is rising higher and higher!

### Our Army in Southern Guangdong Achieves a Victory in Counterattack. Eastern Zhejiang is Tense, and the Battle in Jin and Lu is Fierce. Japanese Troops Open up Outside the Pass, and Their Strength is Empty.

[Special Telegram from Our Newspaper in Chongqing on the 1st] After the war in eastern Guangdong broke out, we took preemptive action in southern Guangdong and launched a full-line offensive. Japan mainly transferred the original forces to other places, so they collapsed and were forced to abandon important military strongholds such as Shemgang. The Japanese in Xinhui Jiangmen also showed signs of retreat. The Japanese troops along the Yangtze River in E, Xiang, and Gan adopted a defensive posture with the minimum number of troops. We have completed our deployment and will take advantage of the weakness to give them a head-on blow. The situation in eastern Zhejiang is gradually becoming tense, and the battles in the guerrilla areas of Su, Lu, and Ji are extremely fierce. Japan's "mopping up" plan is about to run into a wall. The Japanese troops in Jin have been defeated in every battle, and their strength has been greatly damaged. Their chaotic actions are no longer worth paying attention to.

[Central News Agency Report from Xingji on the 1st] Recently, because of the serious situation on the border between Manchuria and Mongolia, Japan deeply felt that its troop strength was insufficient, and there were no troops to transfer from within the country. Therefore, it has recently transferred a large number of Japanese troops in North China. According to sources, there are many military trains traveling north on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, averaging more than five trains every day and night, all full of combat troops, military vehicles, gasoline, tanks, artillery, and military supplies. These trains all depart from Tianjin and head to the Northeast. According to other sources, Japanese personnel said that from July 1, the Japanese army will completely withdraw all Japanese troops from various stations along the Tianjin-Pukou and Ping-Han Railways and various places in Ji Province and concentrate in Changchun.

Full-Line Counterattack in Southern Guangdong. Japanese Planes Reconnoiter and Bomb Eastern Guangdong for Days

[Special Dispatch from Nanfeng News Agency in Shaoguan] After our various armies in Guangdong Province launched a full-scale counterattack, our army in Beijiang, divided into two routes, headed south. One route advanced along the Guangzhou-Huaxian Highway after recapturing Xinjie, approaching Shijing. Japan urgently increased its troops by more than a thousand to defend the Gang, attempting to resist our other large army surrounding Zengcheng. Another Yuan brigade advanced along Longyandong, and is now launching an offensive towards Longyandong. The sound of gunfire can be clearly heard in Guangzhou. The puppet regime is shaken, and people are leaving the urban area one after another. Taipingchang will be restored soon. Our army in He-Xin, divided into two routes, launched an attack, advancing towards Huicheng. One route recaptured Daxiaomeishan, approaching the suburbs of Xinhui City, and the other route advanced along the Heshan Highway.

[Fast News from Dalu News Agency in Huizhou] The Japanese army that invaded the south launched the Chaoshan War, implementing its so-called conspiracy to intensify its coastal activities. In recent days, more than a dozen Japanese ships of various sizes, including an aircraft carrier, have been moored in the areas of Haomen, Ma, Shanwei, Qiantian, Zhelang, Jiazi, Jinxiang, and Jieshi. On the 30th, according to intelligence from institutions here, three Japanese ships were found on the sea off Shanwei Port, seemingly intending to reconnoiter. A Japanese seaplane was dispatched from the Japanese ship, and after flying low for a week, the Japanese warship fired more than ten shots, randomly bombing the barren islands off our coast. This kind of boring behavior is aimed at probing our reality and is still free of any other abnormalities. On the 27th, seven Japanese planes took off from the Japanese ships in Shanwei, four planes flew to Haili, Zijin, Xingning, and Meixian for reconnaissance, and three planes flew to bomb the county seat of Lufeng, dropping four bombs, killing and wounding more than a dozen civilians. When the Japanese planes bombed, the prisoners in the county prison took the opportunity to escape from prison. Fortunately, the prison guards and police discovered this and immediately divided into groups to intercept them, killing two on the spot. The remaining prisoners, seeing this, did not dare to cross the line.

[Central News Agency Report from Zhaoqing on the 1st] After our army recaptured Daxiaomeishan, it immediately joined forces with a certain unit to attack Jiangmen Xinhui. On the 29th, Wu, the vanguard, occupied Jinniushan, Licun, Shuanglongku and other places, and took advantage of the victory to advance to Ma'anshan, Foziao, and Shichu. In the evening, our plainclothes team attacked Xinhui County, destroying the Japanese power plant and the Japanese-puppet organization, the Tong Sheng Club. The entire city was plunged into darkness and the order was disturbed. At the same time, Jiangmen Zhongshan Park and Yandun Mountain were attacked by our guerrillas, and several battles broke out. Now Jiangmen Xinhui electric messages are not getting through and the situation is chaotic. The Japanese-puppet were in panic and terror, and after responding to the battle in a hurry, they set fire to the nearby villages, seemingly preparing to withdraw.

[Haitong News Agency Report from Chongqing on the 1st] According to Chinese military authorities, the Chinese army has made further progress in Guangdong, recapturing several important stations and pressing to within thirty-one miles of Guangzhou. It is also reported that several thousand Japanese troops in Shantou are holding their ground against the Chinese army northeast of Shantou.

Walled-in Yicheng Under Siege. Small Gains Made in Northern Hunan Offensive

[Central News Agency Report from Luoyang on the 30th] The situation in Zhongtiao Mountain, since the recapture of Yuanqu, there have been no Japanese troops from Pinglu to Yuanqu and south of Hengling Pass, and the front line is extremely solid. The Japanese troops who harassed Yicheng on the 27th are being lured and annihilated by our army. A certain unit of our army in Lanhancun launched a guerrilla attack on the 28th and encountered the Japanese troops in Zhangdian. They were defeated by our army. At present, all the troops of our army in Zhongtiao Mountain have fully demonstrated the tactics of mobility.

[Central News Agency Report from Xingji on the 30th] More than a thousand Japanese troops from Quandiandian on the Baijin Highway launched an offensive on the morning of the 25th, divided into three groups. One group of about two hundred advanced to Niujiashan (west of Quandian, one mile) via Wangcun, one group of about two hundred attacked Changjiacun (fifteen miles west of Quandian), and one group of more than five hundred attacked Laoniu (ten miles southwest of Quandiandian). Our army divided into groups to meet them head-on, and the left and middle routes have already been completely defeated and fled to Maijiazhuang, five miles west of Zoumazhuang. They are currently being pursued by the Japanese troops.

[Central News Agency Report from Xingji on the 30th] The Japanese troops who occupied Hongzidian Bailing in the northwest of Pingshan, western Hebei, launched an offensive westward in separate routes. They captured Xiaojue and Xiakou on the 20th. The Japanese troops in Shangshezhen (north of Meng County, eastern Jin) advanced eastward via Chelu. They have now merged with the Japanese troops in Xiaojue and Xiakou, totaling about 2,500. In recent days, there have been more than a dozen Japanese planes reconnoitering and bombing between Xiaojue and Bailing, attempting to launch a large-scale offensive westward. They are currently engaged in a fierce battle with a certain detachment of our army in the Xiaojue Tianli area.

[Central News Agency Report from Boluo on the 30th] A certain powerful guerrilla detachment of our army encountered a part of the Inada Inaba Division on the night of the 29th near Shimiya, north of Dayun Mountain, southeast of Yue. After being surrounded by our troops for about two hours, the Japanese troops retreated north. Our troops captured thirteen Japanese rifles, two steel helmets, and killed more than twenty Japanese troops.

### Under Our Guerrilla Control: The Lu Bureau Constrained to a Corner; Qingdao's Japanese Textile Factories Still Unable to Recover; Many Puppet County Heads Claim Illness and Dare Not Take Office

[Special Dispatch from Shanghai] The Shanghai English-language newspaper "Great Drop Report" published a detailed dispatch describing the recent situation in Shandong Province. It stated that in the early stages of the Sino-Japanese War, when Chinese forces withdrew from Shandong Province, they left as little as possible behind, allowing the Japanese army to occupy it. Factories and industrial enterprises in Qingdao were systematically destroyed, railways were dismantled, and bridges were blown up. However, the Chinese army left behind guerrilla forces. The Japanese army has been fighting these guerrillas in Shandong Province for over a year. Chinese policy is to impose a significant economic burden on the Japanese army whenever possible and to use guerrilla forces to hinder Japanese reconstruction efforts. The following points demonstrate the success of the Chinese policy: (1) The Japanese army has to maintain expensive military defenses throughout the province. (2) The guerrilla forces constantly lure the Japanese army into "pacification" campaigns, consuming even more resources. (3) The Japanese army's power is limited to areas marked by bayonets, while inland economic resources are cut off, preventing the Japanese army from obtaining them. Of Qingdao's 160,000 inhabitants, 23,000 are Japanese, with an increase of 600 each month, as ships sailing from Japan to Qingdao are fully loaded with Japanese people. The destruction of Japanese industries in Qingdao is estimated at 400 million Japanese yen. Although some reconstruction is underway, it is progressing slowly due to a lack of capital in Japan. Although the Japanese army has occupied Qingdao for over a year, the Zhonglong Textile Factory, with losses amounting to 23 million Japanese yen, has yet to resume operations. Qingdao's 1,000 White Russians have been organized by the Japanese army into an anti-communist alliance and used as an "automatic" demonstration parade. The Japanese side claims that the Shandong guerrilla forces are mostly located in the mountains east of Qingdao and southeast of Jinan. However, out of Shandong Province's 107 counties, the puppet provincial government has only appointed county heads for 76 counties, and more than one-third of them are receiving monthly salaries for county heads due to "weak health," yet have not taken office, demonstrating that Chinese forces are also active in that area. According to a certain Japanese army lieutenant general, the Shandong guerrilla forces are equipped with rifles, machine guns, and some field artillery. The lieutenant general also said that the individual courage of the guerrillas is very high. Observers say that the current number of guerrillas is not much different from the number six months ago. In terms of guerrilla activity, the area around Jinan is one of the most troublesome areas for the Japanese army. In the mountains around Jinan, the troops of Navy Admiral Shen Honglie often launch attacks on Japanese garrisons from their bases. On the night of May 16, about 600 Chinese soldiers attacked Japanese garrisons in southeastern Shandong Province. The Japanese garrison in Jinan had to urgently dispatch troops to rescue the attacked Japanese platoon. The Japanese army in Jinan has a strict defense. Chinese entering the railway station are subject to strict searches, and no entry or exit is allowed after 10:00 PM. However, guerrillas often enter the city to trade and occasionally engage in anti-Japanese activities. Several "provincial government" officials have been assassinated in this Japanese-controlled provincial capital of Shandong. Japanese investment in Jinan is not as large as in Qingdao, and most of the establishments are taverns and brothels. Earlier this month, the Japanese army in Shandong Province began attacking the two divisions of Chinese troops and guerrillas numbering over 100,000 between the coast, the Longhai Railway, the Jinpu Railway, and the Jiaoji Railway. The Japanese authorities in Beiping stated that their purpose was to "disperse these anti-Japanese elements" and gain control of cotton and peanut production areas. At the same time, other Chinese forces are attacking south of Yantai, attempting to wipe out the "new order" claimed by the Japanese side. All of this is a general overview of the current situation in Shandong Province.

### Returning Triumphantly from Zhongtiao Mountain: Conversation with the Commander-in-Chief of the Henan-Shanxi War Zone; We Choose Advantageous Terrain for a Successful Counterattack; The Enemy's Morale is Exhausted, Showing Signs of Collapse

[Dispatch from Luoyang via the Central News Agency, 30th] The stubbornly resisting [enemy] launched an eighth offensive on Zhongtiao Mountain a week ago, creating an extremely tense situation. A certain commander-in-chief personally crossed over to the front lines to supervise the battle, employing a swift and mobile strategic [approach] to drive out the strong [enemy], conquer Yuanqu, and kill or wound five or six thousand [enemy] troops, once again creating glorious achievements. The certain commander-in-chief returned to a certain place on the evening of the 29th, passing through here, and over two thousand people from all walks of life arrived at the station to welcome him. A reporter from this agency went to a certain place to congratulate this certain person on his victory and to express his gratitude for his hard work. According to this certain person, the victory on Zhongtiao Mountain was due to the commanders using their lives and especially the assistance of the people. The stubbornly resisting [enemy] launched an offensive with 15,000 to 16,000 men, divided into four routes, with the intention of "sweeping away" our strength in one fell swoop. Since our side saw through [the enemy's] conspiracy, we avoided fighting at the "time and place desired" by [the enemy]. We then voluntarily abandoned several strongholds, luring [the enemy] deep into our pre-arranged advantageous areas. In other words, we waited for [the enemy] to fall into our encirclement, and then we launched a full-scale encirclement. Fortunately, the heavy rain and the people's firm policy of clearing the fields disrupted [the enemy's] communication and supply lines, so we were able to defeat the stubbornly resisting [enemy] in one fell swoop. This is certainly a factor in our victory, and the low morale of the [enemy's] combat units was also a reason for our army's victory. According to reports, the panicked state of [the enemy's] forces during this offensive on Zhongtiao Mountain was even worse than before. The [enemy's] officers and soldiers at all levels regarded Zhongtiao Mountain as a fearful path, and they all hesitated to move forward, which led to the [enemy] using machine guns behind the lines to suppress and kill retreating lower-ranking officers, indicating the deepening of the internal crisis of the [enemy]. At this point, the base person also cited the example of Wu Peifu's army, which had previously roamed the country, invincible, until it joined forces with the National Army in Wuhan. At that time, the morale of Wu's army had declined, and senior officers also used machine guns and ammunition behind the lines, but ultimately they could not avoid defeat. Generally speaking, when commanders are fighting, if morale declines, it is a sign of collapse. Finally, the [said] person believes that the [enemy] on Zhongtiao Mountain has suffered a heavy blow, and its elite forces have been exhausted. Now it has reached a point where it is difficult to advance or retreat. If this continues, it is expected that [the enemy] will soon experience a total collapse, and Shanxi, the last shield [of China] in North China, will definitely become more consolidated.

### Fuzhou is Peaceful; The US Will Protest the Bombing of the American School; [The Enemy] Threatens to Block the Min River on the 6th

[Dispatch from Chongqing via the Central News Agency, 1st] A Shanghai dispatch reports that the British authorities have announced that the Japanese Navy has agreed to extend the period for blocking the Min River to the 6th to allow British nationals in Fuzhou to evacuate at their leisure. The British Consul in Fuzhou is now advising British women and children to evacuate as soon as possible.

[Local News] Fuzhou expatriate groups here received a telegram from the Fuzhou authorities yesterday, stating that the situation in Fuzhou and Wenzhou is as peaceful as ever and that no fighting has occurred. After occupying Shantou, the [enemy] army declared that it would block the ports of Fuzhou and Wenzhou, but this move is impossible because the number of [enemy] ships sent to Fuzhou is small and insufficient to be dispatched. A number of cargo ships recently sailed from Wenzhou to Fuzhou, seeing [enemy] ships cruising in the distance, prohibiting the transport of passengers and goods, until in the afternoon the [enemy] ships suddenly redeployed completely, and the transports were able to enter the port as usual, and traffic was as smooth as ever.

[Dispatch from Washington via the Haitong News Agency, 1st] The State Department announced that the US government will protest the bombing of the American United High School in Chuanzhou by Japanese planes. Secretary of State Hull said that the United States will seek compensation for all damaged American property.

### Air Battle Over Chongqing: We Shoot Down Several [Enemy] Planes

[Local News] According to the German-owned Sichen Four Newspaper, yesterday afternoon, [enemy] planes bombed Chongqing, blindly dropping bombs and indiscriminately bombing civilians, causing many fires. Our planes intercepted [the enemy] planes in the air, resulting in the shooting down of several [enemy] planes. Details are still unknown.

[Dispatch from Chongqing via the Haitong News Agency, 1st] Yesterday, Friday afternoon, after the air raid alarm sounded here, ten million people immediately went to air raid shelters to take refuge, and the order was well maintained. Soon, the streets were empty. When the time came, the all-clear signal was heard. It was reported that 30 Japanese planes attacked Liangshan in three teams, and the losses are unknown. Also, the day before yesterday, 27 Japanese planes wreaked havoc on Fengjie and Yunmo.

### Wang the Traitor Flatters [the Enemy] and Sells Out the Country; Volunteers; Asks to Train a Puppet Army to Serve as [the Enemy's] Lackeys; [The Enemy] Does Not Value It and Ignores It

[Dispatch from Chongqing via the Central News Agency, 30th of June] A Shanghai dispatch states that [Zhao] Yong has been running errands for Wang the Traitor, going to Tianjin to discuss with the North China puppet government the matter of organizing a puppet central government. He returned first on the 26th, while Wang the Traitor only returned on the 29th. According to Zhao Xiangren, the North China puppets are still quite distant in their attitude towards Wang the Traitor. Also, Miao Bin met with Wu Peifu on behalf of [Wang the Traitor], but Wu remained unmoved. Wang the Traitor did not mention the previous rumors that he would request to continue using the Qingbai flag at all. Furthermore, the [Enemy] side did not fully agree to the demand to withdraw troops. Wang the Traitor flatters [the Enemy] and, even though he first accepted the intention to train a puppet army of many divisions, allocate them to various places, replace [the Enemy] troops, maintain order in the occupied areas, and gradually go to the front lines to relieve [the Enemy] troops who have been exhausted by prolonged fighting so that they can be transferred back for reorganization, the [Enemy] side has not yet agreed. Therefore, Wang the Traitor's negotiations in North China were of no result at all. At the same time, [Wang's] comrade Hong [Wei] opposed Wang the Traitor very strongly due to conflicts of interest. Wang the Traitor invited [the Traitor] to Shanghai for face-to-face negotiations, but if he does not come, Wang the Traitor is determined to make a trip to Nanjing within days.

A Traitor Newspaper Resumes Publication Today

[Dispatch from Shanghai via Reuters, 1st] The "China Daily" newspaper, sponsored by Wang Jingwei, which ceased publication in August 1937, will resume publication tomorrow. It is reported that Wang Jingwei will personally handle the affairs of the newspaper.

Buying Up Newspapers to Incite People's Hearts

[Dispatch from Chongqing via the Central News Agency, 30th of June] A Shanghai dispatch states that the Guide newspaper announced that it would cease publication on July 1 because the publisher, Fei Shi and Bao Na, were bribed with 10,000 yuan by people sent by Wang the Traitor. Therefore, the Guide newspaper suddenly announced its cessation of publication. The cooperation and printing problems of the "English Night Report" are also feared to be difficult to continue, and Fei [Shi] will take over the machinery according to Taiwan's contract, but the authorities are arguing according to Indian precedent. Also, Mr. Fei is scheduled to return to his country by ship on July 10, which is one of the conditions proposed by Wang the Traitor's side. In addition, the Translation Newspaper bribed by Wang the Traitor will also cease publication.

[Dispatch from Chongqing via the Central News Agency, 30th of June] A Shanghai dispatch states that the China Daily newspaper, run by Wang the Traitor, is planned to be published on July 7th or 8th. Also, the Wenhui newspaper, which was bribed, will be reprinted and republished by the China Daily after the China Daily is published.

### Genghis Khan's Coffin Arrives in Gansu

[Dispatch from Jingning via the Central News Agency, 30th] Genghis Khan's coffin arrived in Jingning on the 29th. People from all walks of life went to the suburbs to welcome and send it off, numbering over 20,000. It will arrive in Dingxi on the 30th and Yuzhong on the 1st. According to the Mongolian Xian [Yun] Bu, the special envoy protecting the coffin, the Mongolians vow to uphold the spirit of Genghis Khan's eastern and western expeditions, unite with the people of the country, and defeat Japan.

### Social Organizations in Various Places Send Telegrams of Condolences to Compatriots in the Tianjin Concession

[Dispatch from Chongqing via the Central News Agency, 1st] The China Construction Society, the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, and three other cultural organizations, as well as the China National League of Nations Comrades Association, sent telegrams of condolences on the 1st to compatriots and friendly people from all walks of life in the Tianjin Concession. Also, the China Labor Association, the National Social Affairs Federation of Trade Unions, and the special envoy office of the Chinese Seamen's Union also sent telegrams of condolences to the laborers in Tianjin.

2. Honored Disabled Soldiers

Weren't the vehicles that came with us also carrying a portion of honored disabled soldiers? Seeing the slogan "If the [Enemy] bandits are not eliminated, the warriors are ashamed to enter this gate," they all seemed to have their own feelings. One of them even fell into deep thought for a long time, perhaps silently thinking about the sad affair of "Lofty ambitions unfulfilled, the body falls first, often brings tears to the hero's eyes." Unexpectedly, as the car swerved to avoid a power pole, his left arm, which was resting on the side of the car and forgotten to guard, was unfortunately severed by four fingers. At that time, there were no medical supplies available, only some cotton and a piece of A-shaped handkerchief that a friend gave me were used to wrap his wound, but he shook his head and declined: "I'm afraid of getting the handkerchief dirty!" Honorable and lovable honored warrior! How self-denying and tolerant of pain were you on the front lines? How heroic and sacrificial were you? From this, we have already seen the great spirit!

Since they are all honored disabled soldiers, of course, each has a moving and inspiring history. One tall and thin Shandong man, in the fierce battle of XX, was captured after penetrating deep into the [Enemy]阵. He saw with his own eyes how the [Enemy] used many cruel methods to insult and kill our soldiers and civilians who had lost the ability to resist.

Because he was a skinny man and also had skin diseases like scabies all over his body, the [Enemy] mistakenly thought he had opium and did not kill him, but wanted to use him. But although they did not kill him, they insulted him in every way. Every time they told him to eat leftover soup and scraps, they would not allow him to use chopsticks or hands, but had him crawl on all fours like a dog to eat... Fortunately, he finally escaped from the tiger's mouth, and after many fierce battles, he captured many [Enemy]. Recently, he came to the rear with honor.

Another stout young man with a purple-tan complexion volunteered from Guizhou to Nanchang, which had not yet fallen at that time, to take the aviation exam, but he failed. He then enlisted in the army and fought in various places north of the Yangtze River until his leg was severely injured. He still wanted to fight desperately on the front line, but [his superiors] gave him four yuan in legal tender and insisted that he crawl back on his own. Later, he slowly crawled down. How was he carried to the hospital by the stretcher team in the middle of the journey? How did he lose a leg after waking up from a nap? He didn't know anything. Later, he was transferred here, and people warmly received him along the way. Some even gave him a commemorative badge of "National Hero," which made him too happy. He said that he has now become so fat, and he wants to find a way to fight the [Enemy] happily again. He will not give up!

They also said: Wounded soldiers have already completed the procedures to remove one hand or one leg to verify them as first-class disabled; if the right eye is injured, or the hands and feet are not flexible, it is second-class disabled; if the left eye is injured, it is third-class disabled. The salaries for each class of disabled are fully paid until the end of their lives. If they wish to return home for recuperation, they can be issued travel expenses of more than sixty yuan. After the war ends, first-class disabled can receive a pension of 200 yuan per year, second-class 100 yuan, and third-class 70-80 yuan. But they do not hope to sit idly and eat, they want to engage in production work as much as possible in a safer place, and they must work hard to eliminate the [Enemy] people as they did on the front line!

Bao City is more than forty miles away from Manchuria, and the places passed are all fertile fields. While the honored warriors were talking loudly, the car had already arrived at Hanzhong City, which is prone to causing nostalgic thoughts.

3. Nanzheng Under Various Lights

Although Hanzhong City is named after Emperor Zhaolie becoming the King of Hanzhong, the actual hometown of the King of Hanzhong is Jiuzhoupu in the east of Mian County (more than a hundred miles away from Nanzheng, with an old fort that has been washed away and is unusable), not the current Nanzheng County seat. However, in terms of wide terrain, abundant products, convenient transportation, and higher cultural level, it is worthy to call Nanzheng the representative county of the Shaanxi-South Hanzhong area.

The main streets in the city are still quite wide and clean, but unfortunately, there are few trees planted on the roadside. Although [Enemy] planes have bombed here twice, the increasing number of regular entrances, the prosperity of the market, and the successive construction of new shops have not been affected. The Northwest United University and other schools have relocated a part of them here; there was a small lithographic newspaper here, and recently the Xijing Daily has also published a Hanzhong version, which can add color to the cultural cause of Hanzhong.

The clothes, conversational tone, and lifestyle of the people are all very Sichuan-flavored. On the first night the reporter arrived, he went to the bathhouse to take a bath, and the attendant refused to accept the tip, which is a kind of beautiful custom that is not found in Sichuan and Shaanxi. Only Houjie and Dongguan are more lively at night. When I went there, I saw that the lamps used by the shops for business were electricity, gas, foreign candles, and oil fire, each throwing their own light, which was very inconsistent. Some even had no lights, and they had to grope forward, but the sound of children singing anti-Japanese songs could help break through the layers of darkness. The two places with great light were two cinemas; one screened "Soviet Union Expelling [Enemy] Report", and the audience was extremely crowded; one screened "Kanto Swordsman", and there were few customers. Then, when I walked to the East Gate, I saw another place emitting strange lights, but when I went closer to look, it was very disappointing: it was a superstitious act of doing salvation for the dead. At that time, the wheel of dharma had not yet turned greatly. Five or six red-eyed and yellow-skinned Taoist priests were talking and picking lice in front of the brightly lit spirit tablet, shamelessly.

Some self-proclaimed "people of the Ge Clan without [the] Clan" saints and sages, no, "[idle] people" and layabouts, despite the extremely tense situation, they always lie in the teahouse all day long, sipping tea as usual. There are storytellers in the teahouse, self-playing and self-singing. The content of the former is nothing more than "Emperor Qianlong's Visit to Jiangnan," and the latter is nothing more than "Consort Yang Intoxicated." In addition, it also attracts a group of poor young people, standing on the road listening attentively. There are also two theaters that perform Qin Opera and Peking Opera, and the advertisements also show that they are mostly performing stale and low-interest dramas. If we don't find a way to thoroughly change this style, I don't know how many more idle people and layabouts will be created in the future!

Returning to the hotel, the inspector of the gendarmerie was lecturing a traveler in a neighboring room; he said in a Changsha accent: "You must know that regarding this type of books, even in our military, only officers of general rank are allowed to read them for reference; as for officers below the rank of school officer, they are all prohibited from reading them. You are here from Chengdu to study, how can you buy this type of books to read? What's more, you said that the bookstore sells them openly, and that it's just for research purposes. If I take you to the headquarters, you'll be free in at least four months!"

"That guest is also asking for trouble," the waiter said softly as he opened the door. "Who told him to buy Japanese [Enemy] books at this time!"

As a result, only the book was confiscated, and the accountant was instructed to send it to the headquarters tomorrow for review. It was not the Japanese [Enemy] book that the waiter said casually! (End)

### Twenty German Planes Soar Over Danzig; It is Rumored That There Will Be an Incident This Weekend; Poland is Watching the Development of the Situation

[Dispatch from Paris via Reuters, 1st] It is widely rumored in London and Paris that there will be an incident in Danzig at the end of this week, but here it is still not possible to officially confirm this rumor.

[Dispatch from Paris via Reuters, 1st] The newspapers here today discussed the recent developments in the situation in Danzig, especially pointing out that the main hope for peace lies in the firm attitude of the democratic countries. "Le Figaro" said, "The Danzig senators are considering the importance of their responsibilities. If the Germans demand the rights of Danzig, then our reply contains only one word, which is 'Czechoslovakia'." "Paris Soir" said, "Unless we have lost control and are led by a love of useless danger, the Axis countries will no longer doubt our determination."

[Dispatch from Berlin via Reuters, 30th of June] This afternoon, people in foreign political circles here are discussing the rumor that Hitler plans to go to Danzig on July 20th. The German government refused to deny this rumor, only saying that they have absolutely no reason to believe it is true. They believe that Hitler would not make such detailed arrangements so long in advance. However, the rumor suggests that other Nazi Party officials, including General Goering, may go there earlier before Hitler goes to Danzig. It is also rumored that if German government officials go to Danzig in the future, they will not notify the Polish authorities in advance as usual. However, it is said that Danzig seems to have heard nothing about the above rumors at this time. Officials and the press have not shown any disturbance about the situation.

[Dispatch from Danzig via Reuters, 30th of June] Today, twenty German planes flew to East Prussia. When passing through Danzig, they circled over Danzig. A team of German plainclothes officers has arrived here by special express train to take over the Advance Corps. These Advance Corps have been renamed "Fatherland Army" and have been patrolling the streets. At this moment, the number of Germans infiltrating is greater than the number of Poles there, but National Socialist Party members are sincerely afraid that Poland will adopt German tactics and launch a preemptive strike. This may be a word of nervous tension. Although people in Danzig witnessed German planes flying over, they also knew that Polish artillery teams were practicing in the city and that various military preparations were being carried out outside the border. Dr. Burckhardt, the League of Nations High Commissioner in Danzig, has not made any statement, but has recognized that the situation is serious.

[Dispatch from Warsaw via the Central News Agency, 30th of June] Political circles here attach great importance to the development of the situation in Danzig and say that the various military measures taken by the Danzig authorities are clearly intended to use psychological pressure to make Poland mobilize its economic and spiritual strength in order to destroy its resistance. At this moment, although Poland remains calm, it will definitely respond to any provocative actions with appropriate means. British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech the day before yesterday was the last warning to Germany. In short, any attempt to change the status of the Free City of Danzig, no matter whether it comes from outside or from within, must be regarded as a cause of war. This is the same in Britain as it is in Poland.

[Dispatch from London via Reuters, 30th of June] British Ambassador to Poland, Sir Kennard, returned to London by plane today. It is said that his trip is to return home for vacation and that there is no special mission.

[Dispatch from Paris via Reuters, 30th of June] The French Ambassador to Poland recently returned home for a trip. French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with him today.

Polish Newspapers Expose German Conspiracy

[Dispatch from Warsaw via the Central News Agency, 30th of June] German Socialist Party in Danzig The Free City's organization of a volunteer corps has recently been revealed by various newspapers here. It is said that yesterday four cannons were transported by waterway to Danzig City, pulled by thirty-two horses to Boskov Mountain, and immediately prohibited anyone from climbing the mountain. In addition, the municipal authorities hired 3,000 workers to rush to build barracks for the volunteers to station in. All of these members are German youths, aged between nineteen and twenty, coming from the province of East Prussia. The municipal authorities have recently ordered 4,000 sets of uniforms and 4,000 pairs of leather boots from clothing stores and shoe stores within the territory. The required wool and leather are all supplied by the National Socialist Party. The Warsaw Evening News reported that the German side now has two paths to follow, one is violent action, and the other is to threaten with war. The latter is the most imminent, but it is sufficient to cause a crisis. As for the authorities of the Free City of Danzig, they are also preparing for the mobilization of residents. One point of attention in the occurrence of various phenomena is that all preparations made by Germany before taking violent actions against Austria and Czechoslovakia were extremely secret, but now in Danzig they are not hidden. Therefore, it can be inferred that this is also a tactic, to make Poland restless, so that Germany can choose an opportunity to take provocative actions in a short period of time. The result of this will make the scope of involvement even wider than before, which is not yet certain, and so on.

[Dispatch from Paris via the Central News Agency, 29th of June] The Danzig City issue has become more acute. Sources here said that Germany is now planning to resolve it in a short period of time, but still hopes to settle it without war through a policy of intimidation. In general, Germany will choose one of the following measures: (1) Using the existence of the disguised German troops in Danzig City to carry out threats, and having the City Council announce a merger with Germany. Regarding this level, Poland will definitely regard this action as an act of aggression and resist it because its access to the sea will be seriously threatened. If so, France will immediately aid Poland, there is no doubt. (2) Germany may seek to hold talks with Poland, attempting to establish a peaceful settlement plan. Regarding this level, the Free City of Danzig still has the necessity to maintain a demilitarized state.

Women, Women

What women need: Before fourteen – good health and good parents; From ten to forty – beauty; From forty to sixty – a good personality; After sixty – money!

From a psychological point of view, marriage is more beneficial to men than to women. There are fewer husbands with nervous disorders than widowers with nervous disorders, but there are more wives with nervous disorders than old maids with nervous disorders.

Girls need four more years to live than boys because girls have more to say.

"Hey! Move aside a bit!"

"Hey! Why? Are you walking as fast as me?"

Voice: It's my father.

### One Person a Day - Su Dongpo

Su Dongpo was clearly different from Han Yu of the Changli School; he particularly liked to associate with monks and Taoists.

One day, Great Su went to visit a large temple again. The large and small Buddhas in the temple, seeing the great benefactor and talented scholar arrive, all formed a welcoming party to greet him. Only one senior monk sat proudly in the temple, completely ignoring him. Great Su was quite displeased. He went up and asked the reason. The monk said:

"Great Benefactor surely knows that the Buddha said: form is emptiness, emptiness is form. This is called: welcoming is not welcoming, not welcoming is welcoming."

Great Su immediately went over and knocked three times on his bald head, "Dong, dong, dong!"

"Does the Venerable Monk know? This is called: hitting is not hitting, not hitting is hitting."

### Maritime Storms 1

— By Captain Launton, Translated by Yang Bi

Previous Summary: In the autumn of 1914, Jack, the radio operator of the Qiukes Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, took a trip to Europe on the German ship "Käpleronqi." On board, they received news that England and Germany had declared war and that British warships were going to intercept the ship. The ship frantically fled. Soon after, they encountered icebergs and were bombarded by British warships. They barely escaped and returned to the American waters of the White Sea. Jack and Bill then returned to New York to see Mr. Qiukes. Qiukes asked them to go to Europe on the "Saint Uke" to find his son.

"That's right, but I don't think that's his name. There's another name. Ah, never mind, what's the use of remembering it – anyway, Mr. Johnson has a bad temper. Just now, when you rejected his letter, I think half of him exploded."

The criticism of this temperamental passenger was suddenly interrupted because a voice burst into Jack's ear. At that moment, one earpiece of the headset was not properly placed. He quickly adjusted it, then gave Bill a toothy smile.

"That's our old friend, the 'Bovik'," he said. "She's waiting for us outside, but this time, don't worry, we're flying the American flag."

The "Saint Mark" stopped on the Atlantic Ocean. The cruiser gradually approached. If this had been on the "Käleronqi," it would have been a thrilling scene.

"Looks like we have a good relationship with her, don't we?" Jack said as they watched the "Bovik" approach, about five hundred yards away.

"If it weren't for that heavy fog, the relationship would probably be even closer," Bill laughed. "Look, they're launching a small boat."

A small boat was lowered from the side of the cruiser, filled with soldiers in full uniform. At the stern sat a spirited junior officer. A row of oars rhythmically struck the water. The "Saint Mark" hurriedly lowered a small ladder. Before long, the young British officer boarded the big ship.

In the first-class lounge, the passengers stood in a line, answering questions about their nationality. They passed through without any difficulty. Then to second class, and finally to steerage. In second class, two German reservists were taken away as prisoners. In steerage, there were as many as six. They seemed not to mind being arrested, even though they knew that this arrest would mean being imprisoned in Halifax or the Bermuda Islands until the end of the war.

Jack and Bill watched with great interest.

"I guess it will be several months, or even years, before these poor devils can see their homes again," Bill said.

"Yes, but you could also say they are the lucky ones in wartime," Jack sighed endlessly.

The inspection work proceeded quickly. An hour later, the prisoners were taken away, and everything was cleared. The two ships saluted each other and separated. The "Bovik" continued her patrol work, and the "Saint Mark" continued her voyage.

### Abnormal Price Hikes Affect Social Stability, Price Increases in Various Businesses Outside the Concessions Should Be Corrected, Hardships for Common Laborers Intensify, Overview of Price Hikes

(Special Dispatch from Shanghai) Shanghai's prices, normally closely linked to those in other parts of the country, are usually a focal point of concern due to Shanghai's role as a national commercial center and a major hub for import and export goods. However, post-war Shanghai prices have been subject to abnormal increases due to imbalances in supply and demand, coupled with government control of foreign exchange leading to drastic fluctuations in the black market, significantly impacting the livelihood of citizens. Details are noted below:

Alarming Price Increases

After the war, agricultural products, industrial products, and mineral products have generally trended upwards. (1) Agricultural products with increases of over 100% include tea, gallnuts, and tobacco leaves. Those with increases of over 50% include tung oil, red sorghum, raw silk, timber, and corn. Those with increases of over 30% include cotton, peanut oil, sesame, and yellow cattle hide. Those with increases of less than 26% include Saigon rice, white rice, wheat, soybeans, dried cocoons, pig lard, table salt, and crude oil. (2) Industrial products such as flour, cotton yarn, cloth, silk, paper, hardware, cement, paints, and chemical raw materials have all trended upwards. In particular, imported paints, chemical raw materials, hardware, and newsprint have seen the most significant increases. Cotton yarn and cloth have also risen sharply, due to factors such as increased overseas shipping costs and the tightening of foreign exchange in the black market, leading to higher costs. (3) Mineral products with widespread and relatively important applications, such as coal, mineral oil, copper, iron, tin, lead, and antimony, have all risen in price. Coal has increased by over 100%, as it is an essential commodity for both industry and daily household use. Oil prices have skyrocketed due to the tightening of foreign exchange in the black market. Other mineral products have also risen in price by approximately 30% to 50% due to transportation constraints.

Merchants Manipulating and Threatening Civilians

Since the 7th of this month, the Shanghai black market exchange rate has decreased from 8.25 pence to 6.5 pence due to adjustments made by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee and restrictions on supply by HSBC and other banks. The cost of imported goods has increased sharply, leading to widespread price increases. These include enamelware, leather goods, thermos flasks, paints, briquettes, iron wire, glass, paint, tin foil, Western medicine, cosmetics, rubber, soap, nails, beer, taxis, foreign paper, woolens, cloth, yarn, cigarettes, ink, hardware, machinery, coal, and petroleum wax. However, raw silk, domestic rice, miscellaneous grains, and domestic food products, which are not directly related to foreign exchange restrictions, have also seen price increases. It is undeniable that some speculative merchants are attempting to manipulate prices for huge profits. In particular, the increase in the price of domestic rice is not far from the price in the winter of 1937, when the war first broke out. Current rice stocks in Shanghai are considered sufficient, and there is no legitimate reason for such a rapid rise. This is clearly due to manipulation by speculative merchants. If measures are not taken to prevent this, it will inevitably have a significant impact on the livelihood of the population.

Widespread Hope for Price Stabilization

In order to stabilize the prices of daily necessities in various regions and to crack down on speculation and manipulation, the National Government has promulgated the "Methods for Assessing Prices and Cracking Down on Speculation and Manipulation during Extraordinary Times." Price stabilization committees are to be established by relevant agencies, chambers of commerce, and trade associations dealing in daily necessities in various regions to manage local price stabilization. Price stabilization committees have now been established in all major cities. However, the situation in Shanghai is special. If a price stabilization committee were to be established, there would be many difficulties in implementing crackdowns. Although some hope that the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, together with various trade associations, will be responsible for assessing the prices of daily necessities and cracking down on speculative manipulation, various trade associations believe that this is practically difficult. However, with regard to the soaring prices in the concessions, it is hoped that the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession will carefully consider and address this issue. Special attention should be paid to the selling prices of industries related to the people's livelihood, in order to avoid impacting the livelihood of citizens.

### Classmates

— Geng Zhi

The union between people based on blood relation results in "same surname," and that based on geographical relation results in "same hometown." Both are undoubtedly beneficial. In addition, the union based on background results in "classmates," which seems to have some benefits as well. I cannot help but devote some ink to praise it.

A few years ago, we heard that "a certain major" [classmates from a certain university] controlled education in a certain province, and thus the education sector of that province became "the alumni association of that university." On a slightly smaller scale, the faculty and staff of a certain school were all classmates from a certain university, and thus that school also became "the alumni association of that university." Similarly, we also heard that the judicial officials of a certain province were all classmates from a certain law and political science school, and thus the judicial sector of that province became "the alumni association of that law school"; or that they were all classmates who had studied in a certain country, and thus became "the alumni association of those who studied in that country"… Once one becomes a classmate, one's prestige increases tenfold, and one's job security is guaranteed, allowing one to enjoy endless benefits. This is the so-called benefit of being classmates.

Since it is an "alumni association," naturally "non-classmates" can only be squeezed out and cannot get a foothold. These "non-classmates" are naturally resentful and angry. However, I think for their sake, there is no need to be so resentful. Who doesn't have classmates? Why not create a few "alumni associations" of your own to play with, instead of relying on others or trying to share their spoils? As long as you can organize your own group tightly and have the ability to do so, throughout history, people have been allowed to create pure groups and exclude dissidents. There is no need to be polite! By creating your own alumni association, you can also sit back and enjoy the benefits.

Originally, all classmates are bound to be very loyal and will do their best to help each other. For example, take Sun Bin and Pang Juan of ancient times. I believe they were both true to their friendship as classmates, because without Pang Juan, Sun Bin would not have had his kneecaps removed, achieving eternal fame and becoming a great man. And without Sun Bin, Pang Juan would not have been shot to death in the Ma Ling Road, leaving a notorious legacy and also becoming a great man! -- A great man should either achieve eternal fame or leave a notorious legacy. By analogy, therefore, their later classmates Su Qin and Zhang Yi, although generally speaking, seemed to have different views and their relationship was not considered very good, they complemented each other, one advocating alliance and the other advocating vertical alliance, achieving the same goal through different paths, and both achieving the position of ministers. The four of them, in the six states, thus formed a small "Guida (Ghost Valley University) alumni association," which can truly be compared to the modern "certain university alumni association."

Another example is Guan Ning and Hua Xin. Although they ended up "severing their mats," I believe they still lived up to their status as classmates, because it was Guan Ning who inspired Hua Xin to make achievements and even participate in the great event of "forcing the abdication of the emperor," and wasn't it also Hua Xin who shaped Guan Ning's noble deeds of not serving kings and nobles? This is also a case of opposites complementing each other, each with its own merits.

To take current events as an example, we often hear that a certain classmate from a certain school does not engage in proper business and specializes in borrowing money from other classmates. The alumni association specifically issues a notice, urging everyone not to be deceived. A certain student from a certain school has committed a disreputable criminal case and is being held in jail. The alumni association hastily publishes a statement in the newspaper denying that they have such a classmate... In all such cases, I still believe that classmates are very loyal and willing to help each other, because in this way, it is enough to make the mean man honest and the cowardly man ambitious. They are inheriting the consistent style of the "Guida alumni association." As for adding a bowl of rice to the classmate who is beneficial to oneself, that is of course the proper thing to do and not worth mentioning.

The virtuous policies of the alumni association are truly so beautiful that they cannot be described, and they truly make me resolve to remain silent after praising them. But there are things that are as beautiful as alumni associations, or perhaps even more beautiful, and I cannot help but write about them in connection, otherwise I will always feel that my views are not broad enough.

This is what is called "same mountain gate," abbreviated as "same mountain" or "same production." It is well known that "same mountain" can help one bargain and fight, but if one wants to achieve great things, if you are the "big brother," you must have many "virtuous brothers" from the "same mountain" to help you. Zhao Kuangyin, Zhu Yuanzhang, and the like were able to ascend to the throne thanks to this. Nowadays, this trend is gradually flowing into the scholar-official class, and it has a tendency to replace the "alumni association." Perhaps the alumni association will even be eliminated!

However, before the "alumni association" is eliminated, I always envy "classmates who are young and not lowly, ride fat horses in light furs." I wish I could insert myself into every such "alumni association"!

### Riverside

— Yu Saifu

Gently descending the steps one by one, we saw the river water in a torrent: mist, permeating the surface of the water… many ragged people, yellow-faced and emaciated, carrying two wooden buckets, descending one step at a time, all the way to the river surface, then picking up two full buckets of water, so heavy.

The water at the riverside is so turbid. But without it, people cannot live. Along the riverside, the cooking smoke drifting out from those dense, dilapidated houses, combined with the silver mist.

The streets along the riverside are mostly muddy, never drying all day.

Oh, this is just the spring stream.

In the summer, when the snow in the mountains melts, it rushes down like a waterfall, all the way into the river, and the river water rises day and night.

An old man said to us: "The summers here are often marked by floods."

When we asked him if he knew about the Japanese bombings, the expression on his face immediately became tense. He pointed to a dilapidated opening in the rear wing on the right.

"It was there that the Japanese planes dropped a dozen bombs, killing more than sixty people…"

"Aren't you afraid?" one of us asked him.

"What is there to be afraid of? It is what it is. We can only fight to the end!

"Even a three-year-old child understands that." He said with a pair of moist eyes, the clothes in his hand were dirty, he placed them on a stone, and struck them incessantly with a wooden stick.

An old man squatting by the river washing clothes is quite rare in the countryside. – I can say that it was the first time I had ever seen it.

"Why are you washing clothes yourself?"

"There's no one… my son went to the army. He wrote in a letter that they are working really hard… My daughter-in-law… my daughter-in-law was killed in that bombing, and two grandchildren also died…"

He seemed to be trembling as he spoke. The pale whiskers under his sausage-like nose trembled slightly with his rapid breathing.

"... Sir, I will be leaving soon, to farm in the mountains... I think that in war, grain is also important. I have a younger brother in the mountains…"

"What kind of work do you do here?"

"Me? I shred tobacco…" As he spoke, he dipped the clothes into the water again, and immediately lifted them up again, without even wringing them out, he carried them away wet, looking very uncomfortable.

We waited for a small sailboat because we had to cross the river. The small sailboat moved very slowly, and it took a long time to come alongside the stone steps. The fellow punting the boat jumped from the boat onto the stone steps via a plank.

The mist still floats on the surface of the river. The water at the riverside is so turbid, the fellow punting the boat is very skillful in pulling the sails.

### Sketches of Living People

— Zhuang Duanyuan

This is a dark age of massacres. There's nothing to say. When the fighting just started, many cities were being bombed on a large scale. The city I arrived at was calmly buried between mountains and rivers, so serene for a year and a half, untouched by barbaric hands. I felt a little joy.

Then came a day of tragic killing. Modern warfare encompasses the vast rear areas, and a county town with a dense population often becomes an ideal target for bombing. Slaughter is distributed as evenly as sunlight to everyone, allowing no personal choice.

The newly made siren emitted a dull, lingering sound, a sound that was both gloomy and mournful. Pushing open the window, it rushed in like a rapidly broadcasted sixty-fourth note, the *di di* sounds echoing. The curtains were rolled up and then lowered again.

I thought I should go to the suburbs. It's an instinct for self-preservation. A bomb drops, destroying houses and people, even though the slaughter is distributed as evenly as sunlight to everyone, allowing no private choice.

On the street, carriages and horses as thick as water blocked the way. On the bluestone road, vehicles trailed past one after another. People fled from their houses, and seeing the panicked crowds, they also became agitated. One hand clutched the money in their pocket, the other pressed down on the hat on their head, rushing into the crowd. Mothers with children covered the mouths of their crying children with their palms. Young wives carried their mothers-in-law on their backs between overlapping backs, tentatively moving forward with shaky steps. An old woman who witnessed a massacre decades ago, her eyes dim, didn't forget the large string of sandalwood prayer beads in her hand. Although she had never experienced the true horror of the massacre in this era, she chanted Zen phrases.

A young woman suddenly fainted and fell on me. I reached out, purely by accident, and touched her chest. I recoiled. Then, she stood up in such embarrassment, and we hurriedly went our separate ways.

Time slipped backward with silent footsteps.

I came to the outskirts of this city. People had already exhausted their ingenuity behind earthen mounds and under bridge piers, calculating angles, light, and shadow, trying to minimize reflections into the sky. A subtle but tense sound of roaring airplanes was in my hearing, recounting and intimating like a repeated memory that another massacre was lurking. I found a trench without a cover and walked into it.

The narrow trench was already crowded with several people. Yes, there was nothing to say. Everyone seemed immersed in bitter thought, not even exchanging glances. I could only stand in the narrow ditch, discovering the fragile soul of a living person unintentionally. He came in, shivering, and stood behind me, nudging me with his elbow.

I turned my face to look at him, and almost simultaneously, I stared. A fat body, a bald forehead, wearing a neat silk-padded robe, and a heavy watch chain hanging from the pocket of his black mandarin jacket. I stared, the round, plump face having lost its original rosiness, gradually revealing traces of cyanosis from the ashen color.

The planes formed nine tight black dots in the distant sky.

Such a noble man, he had a heavy watch chain, he had money. Just the heavy watch chain alone told me that he should be timid, he should always preserve his life to enjoy his life. But the planes drew closer, the loud engine making people afraid. I saw him squat down, despicably squatting at my feet. For once, I felt proud that I was sheltering a life, a fragile life trembling at my feet, trembling more violently as the engine sound grew louder. But I still felt that I couldn't put his mind at ease. He might still think that hiding at my feet wasn't safe enough. Of course, the best thing would be if he could shrink, if the fat man could shrink to the size of a small bead, and I could bend down to pick up this small bead and put it in my pocket while the planes circled overhead. This shouldn't be too indecent. When the engine sound faded away, I would take the small bead out of my pocket again, let her turn back into a fat man, still rich, with his heavy watch chain, and return to the city. He would still be a happy man, stretching his waist and living his wealthy life.

The sound of the first bomb roared, and at the same time, the first anti-aircraft gun fired. The nine light bombers scattered in the sky, scattering as if the number of planes had increased. This was a little terrifying, right? Machine gun bullets also started to fire down from the planes. The fragile life squatting at my feet trembled again. I saw him lowering his head, burying his face deeply in his hands. Yes, if there was another small trench connected to this ditch, he would definitely spread his limbs and quietly crawl into it.

A continuous cough rose from the other end of the trench, like the cough of someone with pulmonary tuberculosis. I felt someone's shoulder bump against my leg. Looking down, the living person had raised his face and said pleadingly.

"Sir, please ask him not to cough."

What I heard was a trembling voice, low, but earnest. A person should have the right to cough, I was silent.

Finally, he stood up halfway, craned his neck a little, and said in a scolding voice:

"Hey! Keep quiet."

The cough couldn't be suppressed and came up again, seemingly even more severe.

"Do you want to die? The plane is overhead, and you're coughing on the ground."

"What if I cough?"

"If the plane hears, can you guarantee you can afford a bomb?"

These words provoked a burst of unrestrained laughter, but the third person immediately interjected, as if changing the atmosphere at that moment.

"Chinese people are sacrificing themselves by the thousands, by the tens of thousands, who guarantees it?"

"Okay, you're cursing people, fuck you..."

A plane aimed a heavy bomb at a residential area within a hundred yards. The power of the bomb changed the air pressure, and the clods of earth in the ditch trembled and fell. The bomb interrupted that arrogant speech.

"You should take off the watch chain, the watch chain will reflect light."

I saw a fat and white hand raised, quietly removing the seemingly heavy watch chain.

### Plunging Towards the Motherland

— Jin Yi

—A Story of a Girl—

So she left, along with several colleagues. It was on a clear afternoon that they boarded the train at the station across the sea.

There were many people in the third-class carriage, but she couldn't understand their language. Similarly, they wouldn't understand her language either. It was said that it would only take three hours by train to reach the destination, so she calculated in her mind how to arrange accommodation, have dinner, and it wouldn't be dark yet.

The wheels rolled powerfully on the tracks, making noise as if uneven. Her mood was like a blank piece of paper covered with road maps. She remembered that in the past, she had also sat on a train leaving her residence, walking a heavy, step-by-step path: returning to her residence, with a gradually lighter and more joyful heart. Now she had nothing. Although she tried to restrain her useless thoughts of home from time to time, there was always an unusual feeling in her heart. She lost her personal trivial joys and sorrows. Her heart, like the hearts of many young people, beat sincerely for the revival of the entire nation. Sometimes it seemed indifferent, but in essence, it earnestly looked forward to that anticipated immense gratification.

It seemed that after traveling a third of the way, they crossed the boundary of the concession. In the areas under their own governance, some were naturally insufficiently developed, and some obviously left behind the remnants of destruction by the enemy. The people in the carriage pointed and spoke to their companions through the glass, but she couldn't understand anything. She could only observe from their expressions, knowing that their hearts were filled with indignation.

Qingzhi pondered to herself as she walked. She remembered that since the beginning of the war, although she had done some work, she had not had the direct experience of escaping the massacre. In the newspapers, she saw enemy planes bomb and kill countless innocent people. Even within that deformed concession, she would painfully watch enemy planes flying low in groups of three or five, dropping bombs. But those bombs would not fall into the concession, so those merchants, young ladies from wealthy families, rich young men, along with herself, could still survive without losing a hair, living in peaceful times. How could such a life be worthy of the brothers who shed their blood on the land to defend the country? (To be continued)

### Local Overseas Chinese Schools Registered Domestically Will Implement Spiritual Mobilization Education; Outlines to be Drafted Soon and Promoted by Overseas Chinese Education Associations to Strengthen Students' Understanding and Beliefs

The National Spiritual Mobilization Plan, resolved and passed by the National Political Council of Representatives last year, and announced by the supreme leader to the whole country for conscientious implementation, has led to overseas Chinese at home and abroad rising to swear allegiance to its implementation. The aim is to make the general public aware of the principles of the nation first, the ethnicity first, military affairs first, victory first, contributing money if you have money, and contributing strength if you have strength, and to strengthen the understanding and belief in the War of Resistance. The overseas Chinese in Hong Kong who have sworn allegiance to the spiritual mobilization have sprung up like a whirlwind and held ceremonies separately. It is heard that the overseas Chinese schools registered domestically, in order to give overseas Chinese a deep belief and practice of national spiritual mobilization, intend to implement spiritual mobilization education. Because each student is for the future construction of China, the need for direct indoctrination is important, but indirect indoctrination is even more sufficient to popularize it among the general overseas Chinese. Therefore, they have identified the implementation of spiritual mobilization education as a key element of wartime education. The implementation method is to use the morning and evening or memorial week assemblies in the school, or class meetings, parent-teacher meetings, etc., to make students practice spiritual mobilization in various ways. On the other hand, they will use the teaching materials in the curriculum to instill the meaning of mobilization, and will create an implementation outline for spiritual mobilization education and ask the overseas Chinese education associations to promote it.

### Ford Cars Sell Well; Exports Improve Year After Year; Many Advantages; Equipment Mostly Unavailable in Other Cars

Since the establishment of the Ford Motor Company, the best and most reliable of its products should be the 1939 Ford car and the Mercury engine. The appearance is quite similar to an 85-horsepower engine, but it is not. It can actually generate 10 more horsepower, and the number of revolutions per minute is reduced by 200 (that is, 3,600 revolutions per minute instead of 3,800). It can also generate greater drag or pulling force, reaching 13 percent, and the number of revolutions per minute is 100 less than the 85-horsepower engine. As for its weight, including the transmission case and the starter, it is only 7 pounds more than the 85-horsepower engine. In terms of horsepower, its weight is actually lighter than any other Ford engine. The pound ratio for the Mercury engine is 6.38, the 60-horsepower engine is 6.75, and the 85-horsepower engine is 7.05. In addition, all Ford Mercury and Lincoln Zephyr cars use baked enamel, which is durable and unparalleled. The Ford has a ventilated Y-shaped windshield, which is not available in other cars. The view is clear because the front edge window is not fitted with metal crossbars to avoid obstructing the driver's view. Other features include curved handles inside and outside the car doors, with no risk of snagging clothes. The top of the front seat back is fitted with soft padding. If a car accident occurs, rear-seat passengers can be protected from injury. There are no protruding handles or controls on the front of the dashboard to ensure safety. The ignition button is mounted on the front of the steering column, so the driver's knees will not touch it. It is also equipped with foot controls to increase or decrease light intensity, and both hands do not need to leave the steering wheel when overtaking other cars and need to reduce the light. In addition, this year's Ford Mercury and Lincoln Zephyr cars are specially equipped with door latches. This simple equipment allows the car doors to open wide for easy entry and exit. All of these are safety features. In addition, there is a special variation. The Ford and Mercury seats are all equipped with flexible compound springs, making them extremely comfortable to ride on. This year's Ford products have all the above advantages. It is appropriate for people in society to purchase Ford cars more enthusiastically than in previous years with sufficient foot controls for headlight beam intensity.

### The Lan Ting in Happy Valley Suddenly Closed Down; The Government Recovers the Land Base

The Lan Ting in Happy Valley is located in a very important location, but no one paid attention to it before. It was abandoned for many years until 1920, when the Tram Company submitted a request to the government to apply for the land to build a repair room, first to allow passengers to avoid sunlight or wind and rain, and second to allow drivers and ticket sellers to rest here for shift changes. Later, it suddenly became a tea room, also selling sweets, biscuits and other foods, with booming business. However, the Lan suddenly moved out completely the day before yesterday, which surprised all sectors. According to people in the store, they told reporters that the government has now recovered the land, so they had to move out.

### Two 10,000-Ton Giant Ships Are Being Built in Hong Kong; A New Atmosphere in the Hong Kong Shipbuilding Industry

The Hong Kong shipbuilding industry has been very prosperous in recent years, with many ships being built in Hong Kong. In the past three months, the urgency of shipbuilding work in various shipyards has opened up a phenomenon that has never existed in Hong Kong before. It was found that on the 30th of last month alone, the tonnage of ships under construction in various shipyards reached 29,760 tons, of which two were 10,000-ton giant ships of the Jardine Shipping Company, which were being built in the Taikoo Shipyard. One is about to be completed and is scheduled for launching on the 19th of this month.

There are three ships that have been launched, weighing a total of 732 tons.

### Two People Injured by Vehicles in Wan Chai and Queen's Road Central Within Three Hours; Wan Chai: Tram Crashes into Tricycle; Queen's Road Central: Child Crushed and Fractured Skull

Yesterday, from morning to noon, within three hours, two traffic accidents occurred in Hong Kong one after another. A man and a child were injured. The child's injuries were particularly severe. It was found that at 11:30 yesterday morning, a tram with a certain number was traveling from west to east, intending to drive to Shau Kei Wan. When it drove to the vicinity of Gilman Motors, a truck suddenly drove out from the side road and crossed the road. The tram driver saw the situation and immediately applied the brakes and stopped to let the truck pass. After the truck had passed, it continued to drive. A tricycle followed closely behind it, unnoticed by the tram driver, and it crashed into the tricycle. With a loud crash, the car was knocked over, and the driver was thrown off the car, injuring the back of his head on a stone, with blood gushing out and unconscious. After the accident, the driver immediately stopped the car, got out of the car to help, and some passengers from the east side helped the injured person up and sent him to the No. 2 Police Station to report the case. After giving a slight dressing, they immediately called the St. John Ambulance to take him to the Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. The injured person's name is Dong Pei, 21 years old, who lives at a certain number in Hill Village Road and makes a living by animal husbandry. He was driving home yesterday because he sent meat to a certain butcher shop, but he was involved in an accident. Also, at 2:00 in the afternoon of the same day, a car with a certain number was driving along Queen's Road Central, near the China Pharmacy. A child, about ten years old, ran out from the arcade, wanting to cross the road. The driver saw the situation and hurriedly turned off the switch and stopped the car, but it was too late. The child was knocked down, and the wheels ran over his head, his skull was broken, and blood and flesh were blurred, dying. The scene was extremely tragic. Afterwards, the driver of the accident car took him to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. The child's injuries were very serious, and there are fears for his life.

### Graduation Examination of South China Middle School Completed

In addition to the invigilator Ge En, Principal Guo Zhaohua, and the directors and teachers invigilating the examination every day, Supervisor Zhang Zimuo also personally came to the school to invigilate the examination on the first and second days, and the order was very good.

### At a Time When Guidance Services Are Flourishing, Female Massage Therapists Have Also Emerged; Fees are Charged by the Hour, Which Is Worth Studying

In recent times, the world advocates the equality of men and women. Women's participation in politics and women's occupations are sung to the skies. Among women's occupations, the most common are female workers in restaurants and tea rooms, dance hostesses, and the recently emerged female tourist guides. As to whether the scope of business of female tourist guides matches their name, this newspaper has exhausted its efforts to expose it. Under the name of tourist guides, engaging in multi-faceted "guidance services," such as the so-called "indoor tourist guides," people can understand the meaning by the name alone. A few days ago, the newspaper reported that the general public had started to petition the Chinese representatives to ask the Hong Kong government authorities to ban them. This is the reason why the guidance business has developed rapidly and the public is eager to eliminate it. Now, at a time when the Hong Kong guidance business that leads people to pornography and leads people to the decadent enterprise is still looking down on the world, there are also massage, foot massage, foot scraping, nail trimming, and corn removal services by women. Although their business methods are different from those of female tourist guides, their claim that "on-call service is available at half a dollar per hour" has the same effect as the guidance business. Whether their business scope is really just massage and nail trimming, or also involves other work, is difficult for outsiders to rashly judge. But judging from the half dollar per hour, we know that there must be something fishy. There are formally trained female nail trimmers, but we have never heard of charging by the hour in such a strange way. In short, with the increasing number of such organizations, those who indulge in the sea of ​​erotic desires, tired of calling "tourist guides," will definitely want to try calling "massage girls." The activities of private prostitutes and courtesans, under the temporary prosperity of the guidance business, already have a sense of opening up the rose bushes. It will soon be seen that "massage girls" and "tourist guides" will have another battle between dragons and tigers. But I don't know whether the tourist guides will not be banned by the authorities, and I don't know whether the massage girls will be able to openly engage in business without being banned.

### The "China Salvation" Farewell Charity Performance; "The Banks of the Yongding River" Was Enthusiastic and Unprecedented; Fundraising for Women's War Relief Society to Relieve Wounded Soldiers and Refugees; Tonight "Catastrophe of the Land" Tomorrow Night "Blood Splattered Peach Blossom"

The "China Salvation" has profound artistry and has long been a sensation in Hong Kong. The first day of the performance yesterday was the national defense drama "The Banks of the Yongding River," which is a masterpiece of the "China Salvation" and national playwrights. It was the first performance in Hong Kong. The drama's purpose was enthusiastic and great. The audience in the full house, in a solemn and tragic atmosphere, applauded warmly, which shows that the troupe's profound artistic cultivation can indeed transfer the audience's emotions. On the evening of the 2nd, they will perform the wonderful drama "Catastrophe of the Land," and on the evening of the 3rd, they will perform "Blood Splattered Peach Blossom." These dramas are all forged from the reality of the War of Resistance and compiled based on practical experience and artistic effects.

### Association of Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Merchants in Hong Kong Held Inauguration Ceremony Yesterday, Over Eighty Members Attended, All Rules Passed Immediately

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Merchants from Jiangsu and Zhejiang in Hong Kong, in order to connect feelings and promote the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, have been preparing to organize an Association of Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Merchants in Hong Kong. After much preparation, it is now largely ready. The association held its inauguration ceremony at 3 p.m. yesterday at the Chinese Club. Over eighty members attended and immediately passed the association's charter and elected directors and supervisors in accordance with the charter. Detailed information is provided below:

Those present on the day included Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Shaoping, Qian Xinzhi, Ruan Weiyang, Chen Binhe, Bei Songsun, Pan Shuan, Zhu Youshan (Bank of China), Xu Guanying (New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory), Xu Jingfu (Bank of Communications), Xi Shiwei (Meiya Factory), Wu Hao (Dada Silk Factory), Xu Mifu (China Industrial Bank), Chen Yuzhang (Datong Bookstore), Wang Maotang (King of Silver Ear), Chai Yuanfu (Tianfu Silk Shop), Liu Songlin (Fuhe Tobacco Silk), Zhou Kuangwen (Yongli Chemical Industrial Corporation), Chen Yaren (Yongli Chemical Industrial Corporation), Dong Boying (Yifeng Porcelain Factory), and more than eighty others.

After the presidium took their seats, Wang Xiaolai was publicly elected as temporary chairman. Wang then delivered a speech, stating that there are many fellow Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincials residing in Hong Kong. Although there was a Jiangsu and Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce before, its scope was still narrow and not well-suited to the needs of the present era. If this organization could be expanded and the spirit of sincere unity advanced, it is believed that it could certainly grasp the assurance of resisting [unclear symbol] and winning. Mr. Zhu then reported on the past situation of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Chamber of Commerce. Finally, Wu Zhihao reported on the preparatory process. The discussion of the charter then began. First, the name of the association was passed as the "Association of Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Merchants in Hong Kong." The association's charter was then discussed in detail.

### Actress Newly Engaged in Fundraising, Sets Out Despite Illness to Donate Flag, Fourth Day's Results Better Than Before

Famous actress Xin Jiu is fundraising for women and war victims by donating standard national flags. Yesterday was the fourth day.

### Today's Tennis Charity Match: Wang and Xu to Perform

To be Held at the Chinese Recreation Club at 3 PM This Afternoon

[Our Newspaper Special Dispatch] A friend who recently arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing once said to me with great emotion, "Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, I have been to many places inland, and the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people in various places I have seen shows that compatriots residing in Hong Kong are the least concerned. Some have simply forgotten their motherland." I wonder if what my friend said is correct. Compatriots in Hong Kong should search their hearts and ask themselves.

I understand that how many people can live in peace while being mindful of danger? Hong Kong is a comfortable haven, and there are many wealthy and leisurely people, so a decadent phenomenon has formed.

However, the general sports community in Hong Kong has in the past done its best to contribute to disaster relief. However, due to environmental constraints, they have not been able to fully express themselves.

The Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Sports Community Wartime Service Corps often has new initiatives for fundraising work. Today, they are holding another tennis charity match, with newly arrived from Chongqing tennis master Wang Wenzheng, Hong Kong's tennis pride Xu Weipei, as well as Xu Jianpei and Xiao Linzhen taking to the court to perform.

Tennis is becoming increasingly aristocratic, and it is believed that this charity match will attract many dignitaries to attend and contribute to the cause.

Wang Wenzheng's skills were honed in Shanghai. In recent years, he has been working in Sichuan and has had few opportunities to compete with good players, so he has not made astonishing progress. He has many masterpieces in his life. Winning the Shanghai Hard Court Singles Championship in 1933 and winning the top spot in tournaments against masters in the Philippines were his most satisfying achievements. Philippine star GVIA, during his most popular era, was twice defeated by Wang. Others such as Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai have also been defeated by Wang. The maturity of his tennis skills can be imagined.

Xu Weipei needs no introduction. His appearance today to compete against Wang almost implicitly suggests to us that this is a major occasion to compete for the number one spot in the country. Of today's three events, this match is the most important and most eye-catching.

The competition will begin at 3 PM at the Chinese Recreation Club in Causeway Bay (next to the Navy Football Field). The program is as follows:

(1) Singles

Wang Wenzheng vs. Xu Weipei

(2) Mixed Doubles

Diao Zuo [unclear] and Yang Weibin vs. Ling Daoshe and Mrs. Zhao Juncao

(3) Doubles

Xu Weipei and Xu Runpei vs. Wang Wenzheng and Xiao Linzhen

Tickets are available in three denominations: $2, $1, and $0.50. Those who purchase raffle tickets will have the chance to win two Dunlop tennis rackets. Philanthropic patrons are invited to arrive early. (The Tennis Court Deity)

### Chinese Baseball Team Defeats Western Team Decisively: Score 15 to 2

Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, the Chinese baseball team decisively defeated the Western team with a score of 15 to 2. The huge difference in the score was unexpected. The Western team tied the score at 2 to 2 in the third inning, and the situation was quite tense. However, in the fourth inning, the Chinese team scored three hits, with Rong Jun, Bingfen, Cansen, and Guodong scoring consecutively. In the fifth inning, Zheng Qu caused Cavalio to mistakenly reach base, and the path to hit led Bingfen, Cansen, Guolian, and Chen Fang to return to home base one after another, scoring a total of five points. Afterwards, Lin Ye made a sacrifice hit and was still on base. Zheng Wenjie was struck out after three strikes. Except for Lian Liang, who advanced to first base, at this time Wenjie, seeing that Lian Liang was barefoot, specially gave his shoes to Lian Liang. The umpires Chang Lingjian and Buling said that when Wenjie passed the shoes, he touched first base. According to the rule that two runners touch the base at the same time, Lian Liang should be called out. However, the Chinese team was sure of victory and did not protest. (Note: In this situation, Wenjie has already been called out and is not a runner, so the umpire should not apply the rule that two runners touch the same base.) In the last inning, the Chinese team scored four more points, resulting in a victory of fifteen to two.

Chinese: 0 1 1 4 5 0 4 = 15

Innings: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Total

Western: 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 = 2

### Today's Baseball League: Youbie Team to Play South China; South China's Appeal Case Still Not Scheduled for Discussion

This morning at 10:00 AM, the public baseball league will feature a match between the Youbie team and the South China Athletic Association. After losing to the Chinese team last Monday, Youbie is even more arrogant. This time, when playing South China, Youbie certainly won't take them seriously, without a doubt.

Since the loss of their star player, South China's resistance has weakened day by day, leading to defeat after defeat. Although pitcher Zheng Kangyong throws with great force, his pitches are monotonous, often exploited by opposing batters. In addition, in the last three innings, he often suffers from a lack of strength, resulting in chaotic technique. This is not the result of not trying hard, but rather a lack of experience. It is hoped that Zheng will respond calmly, use a cool head to take care of each base, and at the same time, examine the batter's stance, pitching to their weaknesses. By using his brain, he will surely improve greatly.

The American warship "Diannu" was originally scheduled to fight the Hong Kong Association today, but because it was ordered to sail to Guangzhou and could not return in time, today's battle is suspended.

During the fierce battle between South China and the Western Association last week, Situ Bi stole to third base. The third base umpire said that Situ had safely reached the base, but umpire Dejilishi, standing behind the pitcher, ruled that Situ was out. South China protested, and the baseball association has not yet held a meeting to discuss who is right and who is wrong. It is still necessary to wait for discussion. The lineups of the two teams today are recorded below:

(Position) Youbie Team South China Team

Pitcher Xia Gaoli Zheng Kangyong

Catcher Wu Yiwen He Xiancheng

First Base Li Anna Chen Yutian

Second Base Susha Tang Rongguang

Third Base Ao Xiagaoli Liang Zhuoquan

Shortstop Li Anna Wu Zhenbang

Left Wing Ao Ma Situ Bi

Center Fielder Ya Bashi Zhu Guolun

Right Wing Ali Huang Yaozong

### Wimbledon Men's Singles: Reaching a Critical Juncture; The Final Eight Have Revealed Four

Yesterday was the fifth day of the Wimbledon Championships. The weather was sunny and the breeze was gentle. There were no unexpected changes in the competition, and the situation became even more heated. The men's singles has gradually reached the final stage, and four players have reached the final eight. (In addition to Austin, Riggs, Corky, and Gugujiezhake, whose fourth-round results are still awaiting tomorrow morning's telegraph, the other four who have already entered the fifth week are Henkel, Pansek, Muhammad, and Smith.) It is unknown whether there will be any surprises afterwards, but it is expected that the ideal candidates for the "final four" will be Austin, Riggs, Henkel, and Pansek.

German number one Henkel defeated French veteran Brunon, one of the four musketeers, 6-1, 6-3, 6-0. Although Brunon's skills were good, his energy was insufficient, so Henkel won easily. This old general no longer had the fierce state of yesterday.

Yugoslavian number one Pansek defeated Argentina's Aixel. Except for the second set, which was more competitive, Pansek always had the upper hand. In the third set, Pansek became more courageous as he fought, and it was even more controlled by him alone. The result was 6-3, 8-6, 6-1.

Thus, Henkel and Pansek have reached the final eight.

The most eye-catching of the day's famous matches was the Indian player Muhammad, who defeated Hungarian Cup player Zigtei in two hours and forty-five minutes and also entered the "final eight." Muhammad has repeatedly performed well in Europe this year. He also shone brightly in the Queen's Club competition before Wimbledon, where he reached the final. Now he has repeatedly defeated strong opponents and passed four rounds in a row, which is really gratifying. Muhammad's performance in yesterday's match was extremely brilliant. The match lasted five sets, and the result was 6-4, 14-16, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, which can be called a fierce battle.

American youth star Smith previously caused a great surprise by defeating famous players Mengchaer and Zhina. Yesterday, he took it a step further and defeated Hungarian Gabolai with a fierce attack, winning in straight sets without much effort. The result was 6-0, 6-4, 6-3.

In the second week of men's doubles, the British team of Collins and Geller and the Southern team of Daros and Parada had a fierce encounter. At the start of the match, the British team lost two sets in a row. In the third set, they went all out and won after a hard fight. Afterwards, they won two more sets in a row, achieving the final victory. The score was 4-6, 3-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-2.

Another doubles team, Oliv and Ai Shi (England), defeated their compatriots Aimo Shuai and Guneier's team in straight sets 6-2, 6-4, 6-4.

The results of three mixed doubles teams are as follows:

In "Mixed Doubles," the top-seeded team of Riggs and Mei Baier (USA) defeated the team of Philpe and Wei De Xu (England). The result was 6-4, 6-3. The American team advanced to the fourth week without much effort.

Another American star McNeil and Dutch star Mrs. Stanmas collaborated to defeat the Geerz Xingdizi ladies team (Germany) in a fierce battle of 14-12, 6-3 and entered the third week.

The team of Corbin and Miss Diman (England) defeated the team of Bai Luosiji and Qude Lisiji Shi (Poland). The result was 6-2, 6-3. The British team also entered the third week.

In the third week of women's singles, there were no surprises. All seeded players entered the fourth week.

Stanmas (Netherlands) easily defeated Miss Brown (England) 6-2, 6-2.

Mrs. Spilin (Denmark) easily eliminated Wute Nu Shang (England) 6-3, 6-1.

Mrs. Fan Ping (England) defeated Miss Hender Baiqu (England). The result was 6-0, 6-3.

Mrs. Madieu (France) defeated Miss Kang Moqi (Hungary). The result was 6-0, 6-8, 6-3.

Another unseeded player, Harf (France), defeated Mrs. Lier Ge Fo (England). The result was 6-3, 6-2.

Also, in the second week of women's doubles, a group result was reported retroactively: Na and Nichols (England) defeated Mori Xun and Wu Women (England). The result was 8-6, 6-0.
