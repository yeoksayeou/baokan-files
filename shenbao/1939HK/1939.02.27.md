### Two Grave Problems Confronting the Nation

Recently, in the development of the international situation, two points are particularly worth noting: one is the abrupt turn for the worse in the Spanish war situation, and the other is Japan's insane recklessness in the Far East. Both reveal the new offensive of the Fascist aggression front and the tendency for the world war crisis to expand prematurely. To what extent this situation will evolve and what impact it will have on China and the world depends entirely on the attitude of the democratic and peaceful front, especially the United Kingdom and France, before a relatively definitive judgment can be obtained. Therefore, we have a serious question today: Under this situation, where will the rulers of the United Kingdom and France go?

The Spanish war was originally a war in which the Spanish democratic republican government was suppressing the Fascist rebel army led by Franco. This war by the Spanish government gained the enthusiastic support of the vast majority of the country's people who advocated democracy, loved freedom, and equality domestically, and it also received the sympathy and assistance of people from all over the world who cherished democracy and peace internationally. Conversely, the Fascist rebel army led by Franco was driven by the aggressors of Italy and Germany and violated the public opinion of the entire nation internally, so it originally had no chance of winning by luck. However, because of the compromising policies of the democratic and peaceful countries, especially the rulers of the United Kingdom and France, under the slogan of "non-interventionism," on the one hand, they prevented the Spanish government from purchasing ammunition and military supplies from the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union according to law. On the other hand, they condoned Germany and Italy's continuous dispatch of naval, land, and air forces and all kinds of military fire and military supplies to assist the Spanish rebel army in combat. Finally, there was the recent fall of Catalonia, which caused the Spanish legitimate government's war of resistance to encounter an unprecedented crisis. However, if the rulers of the United Kingdom and France could realize the danger of condoning the aggressors at this time, resolutely abandon the compromising policy, and use force to assist the Spanish government in sanctioning the rebel army and its commanders, the authorities of Italy and Germany, then, given the fact that Italy and Germany were outwardly strong but inwardly weak, not only could the Spanish situation turn from danger to safety, but the European situation would also have the hope of turning to stability. Unexpectedly, the rulers of the United Kingdom and France valued their own class interests more than the interests of the country and the world, and finally adopted a policy of further compromise with the aggressors of Italy and Germany, superficially attempting to suppress the Spanish government, end the Spanish war, and achieve temporary peace by recognizing the Spanish rebel army and its regime. Unfortunately, the result of this policy is not only directly sacrificing Spain, but also after Italy and Germany win in Spain, their feathers will become more prosperous, their arrogance will become higher, the European situation will become more and more dangerous, and the crisis of the great war cannot but become more urgent and expanded!

Japan's aggressors have recently expanded their recklessness in the Far East, such as forcibly occupying Hainan Island, bombing Luohu in the New Territories of Hong Kong, and robbing the concessions in Shanghai. The reason why they have advanced their launch at this time is that the intensified implementation of the compromising policy of the rulers of the United Kingdom and France on the Spanish issue is the most important motive! Japan's reckless actions in the Far East are, on the one hand, the prelude to the new strategy implemented by the Italian and German aggressors in Europe, and on the other hand, the alarm of the "September 18th Incident in the Pacific." The purpose of the first step is to  force the authorities of the United Kingdom and France to abandon their aid to China policy and force our country to stop resisting Japan. The second step is the unfolding of the "Pacific Hegemony War," and those threatened will not be limited to Hong Kong, Singapore, Annam, Burma, and the Philippines, which is an inevitable trend. All hopes of surviving under the iron fist of Fascist aggressors will be shattered without a trace by bloody tears. How to prevent this crisis, on the one hand, depends on the heroic perseverance of the Chinese nation's war of resistance against Japan, and on the other hand, it still depends on the mutual unity and cooperation of peaceful and democratic countries, especially the rulers of the United Kingdom and France, abandoning any compromising policies, actively promoting the democratic and peaceful front, and sanctioning Fascist aggressors.

According to recent intelligence, the United Kingdom and France have paid close attention to the new recklessness of the aggressors in the Far East, believing that the situation is very serious. Japanese newspapers also published a message from Germany on the 25th of this month, stating that the United Kingdom has completed its Pacific defense plan, and that Singapore, Darwin, and New Guinea have been connected to form a line of resistance against attacks. According to a Reuters report on the 26th of this month, the British government will transfer British-Indian troops and heavy artillery from Singapore to Penang Island, a transportation hub between Europe and Asia in the Indian Ocean and the Strait of Malacca, next Wednesday. On the same day, a Hanoi telegram relayed news to Paris, stating that French military technical experts have already drafted various plans on how to defend Annam. Mr. Bosquet, vice chairman of the French House of Representatives Naval Committee, recently, in view of the possibility that Japan may jointly attack Annam with Siam, also strongly urged France to strengthen the defense of French Annam. These news are generally reliable, which shows the positive attitude of the rulers of the United Kingdom and France towards the Far East. However, we must recognize that the recklessness of the three major aggressors, Japan, Germany, and Italy, is different in terms of geographical area, namely Europe, Africa, and East Asia, but in fact, they all aim to realize their new demands by coercing the rulers of the United Kingdom and France. Therefore, the rulers of the United Kingdom and France will never be able to compromise in Europe and win strongly in the Far East alone. Therefore, we certainly hope that the United Kingdom and France can quickly take a strong policy of resisting aggression in the Far East and actively strengthen the military defense forces in the Far East, so that the reckless blackmail conspiracy of the Japanese aggressors, who are outwardly strong but inwardly weak and full of crises, will completely fail. But we hope even more that the people of the United Kingdom and France will urge their governments to quickly abandon the compromising policies that harm the country and the world, and comprehensively implement the actions of united democratic and peaceful countries to resist Fascist aggression. Because only in this way can the position and prestige of the United Kingdom and France in Europe and the Far East be guaranteed, and only in this way can the crisis of world war be thoroughly reduced and eliminated, and the reasonable resolution of the difficulties of various countries and the reasonable development of the interests of various countries be promoted.

### The New Appearance of Changsha

— By Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya

Following the fall of Guangzhou, the retreat from Wuhan, and the great fire in Changsha, which once drew immense attention and infinite sympathy from the world, only a few months have passed. However, the local authorities and people of the province, adhering to the government's policy of "resistance on one hand, and national reconstruction on the other," are actively engaged in relief work and promoting reconstruction plans. It seems that Changsha, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, will soon display its new appearance amidst the great torrent of the national reconstruction effort.

The reporter returned from Miluo to Changsha, getting off the train at around four o'clock in the morning. A porter led the way to find a hotel, walking through several unnamed streets and alleys. Although the roads had been cleaned up very neatly and one could walk normally, the east was not yet bright, and it was drizzling. Looking at the dilapidated walls on both sides that had not burned down, they seemed to sway precariously, as if about to collapse head-on. The kerosene lamps hanging on the police booths in the middle of the road emitted a dim and eerie light. Occasionally, stepping heavily, one would elicit echoes like those in an empty valley. Faced with this desolate and gloomy environment, hearing these particularly mournful sounds, a feeling of loneliness and darkness that breeds unease couldn't help but frequently assail the heart.

After a while, a large group of people came towards us. The sound of hooves clattering, and the shadows of people looming, seemed to be about a battalion in strength, walking past us on the right, one file after another. The head of the column was indeed rushing silently with a gag in their mouths, not uttering a word, until at the end of the column, a commanding officer with a Northeastern accent scolded a soldier: "What are you doing with your hands behind your back!" What a "What are you doing with your hands behind your back!" This not only allows one to imagine how strict the military discipline of this unit usually is, but also seemed to strike a loud morning bell in the surrounding quiet and dark air!

Indeed, the morning bell really rang, and the sky gradually brightened. It turned out that after the darkness, there was indeed "light"!

After placing the luggage in a hotel across from the Finance Department on Zhongshan Road, bathed in the morning light filtering through the thin clouds, and with a conflicting feeling of wanting to see but being unable to bear it, I went to inspect the disaster areas. In fact, the disaster area was right outside the door; moreover, it was burned as the saying goes, "Changsha is one piece," not knowing which area to go to first. Later, I decided: Since I'm walking aimlessly, I might as well just walk and see what happens.

Now that I have walked and seen, because the disaster area is particularly large and the disaster situation is extremely serious, it would be difficult to describe it in detail. Therefore, I can only use a summary method to briefly explain it:

The central urban area, except for the Finance Department, the theater, and twenty or thirty houses near the National Products Exhibition Hall on East Zhongshan Road that were still spared, the houses in major streets and alleys such as Zoumalou, Huangcang Street, and Yaowang Street have all been completely burned to the ground. The devastation is comparable to the Zhabei and Nanshi districts destroyed by fire during the August 13th Shanghai battle, and the Guilin disaster area that has been bombed and burned by enemy aircraft many times. The western part, such as Taiping Street, Daxi Gate, and Xiaoxi Gate, has also become a field of rubble. In the south, except for a part of Bixiang Street, Liangchangping, and Huilong Mountain, the rest have all been reduced to ashes. In addition, there are many areas that have not been inspected, but eight or nine out of ten are also razed to the ground. In short, the ancient capital of the Chu Kingdom for thousands of years has been reduced to a de facto scorched earth!

Government agencies: the Finance and Education Departments were unscathed, the Civil Affairs Department still had a part left, while the Provincial Government, Telegraph Bureau, Telephone Bureau, etc., all perished together. Public places: the National Products Exhibition Hall, with its magnificent architecture and a variety of goods, and the Tianxin Pavilion, with its towering buildings and beautiful scenery, except for the National Products Exhibition Hall retaining some reinforced concrete remains to勉供 a few refugees to live in, all the rest of the scenery was buried by the ruthless fire. Spinning mills, electricity companies, and some foreign properties, and 民居望衡對宇 also inevitably suffered the disaster of being implicated. Temples and monasteries scattered in various districts and streets, and statues of bodhisattvas, mostly formed an indissoluble bond with the God of Fire, and ascended to heaven together; only the "Tianfu Bodhisattva" remained in the mortal world. The ignorant people, blindly believing in its power, made the incense particularly prosperous at that time.

The total loss of this Changsha holocaust, according to the comprehensive survey by the city's Provisional Fire Relief Committee, is estimated as follows: there were 31,884 houses, of which 20,838 were completely destroyed, 290 were partially destroyed, and 10,747 remain. About two-thirds of the entire city was destroyed.

The number of deaths in the fire, according to the organizations responsible for burying the bodies, totaled 656. However, among them, there were those who froze to death, starved to death, and died of illness. It is difficult to determine how many were burned to death, but it is estimated to be around 500. Among them, there were 220 bodies resembling wounded soldiers. Most of the others who died of illness, starvation, and freezing were also wounded soldiers (those who were scattered and missing were not included), which is particularly regrettable! It is urgently hoped that the central government and the responsible agencies in various war zones should take full responsibility for the treatment of wounded soldiers in the future, and strive to properly ensure the safety of these wounded and sick soldiers, which is the way to preserve soldiers with rich combat experience, and to enhance the nation's morale in resisting the war. According to the Changsha Municipal Government, the number of injured was about 27, and the number of displaced people was about 254,507.

The property loss is currently not accurate. If estimated according to the Changsha Municipal Government's estimate for the eight towns and four townships under its jurisdiction, the house loss totaled 89,033,880 yuan, and the goods loss totaled 55,893,010 yuan, but the actual loss should be more than this. It is said that the area of Changsha City is 21 square li, equivalent to 700,000 square zhang. The average construction cost per square zhang is about 400 yuan, so the total loss should be 280 million yuan. Among the 700,000 square zhang, if one-tenth is used as a commodity gathering place, and each square zhang is calculated at 100 yuan, then the commodity loss should be 70 million yuan. Other telephone and electricity projects, public and private equipment, and direct business losses and relief costs are about 50 million yuan, so the total should reach 300 million yuan.

When the fire was spreading, many military and political officials, such as Provincial Chairman Zhang Zhizhong, did not leave Changsha, and tried to remedy the situation. In particular, after receiving the telegram, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek immediately came to console the people and took the following four measures: first, arrest the responsible persons and punish them severely according to the law; second, allocate huge sums of money to relieve the affected people; third, mobilize heavy troops to strengthen Changsha's defense; fourth, reorganize the local military and police institutions to handle all the aftermath.

Commander Chen of the × War Zone immediately ordered Commander Yu Jishi of the ×× Army Corps to lead his troops to guard Changsha and Zhuzhou, and to do their best to maintain order and restore traffic. The Political Department also sent a large number of staff to Changsha to manage the work of comforting and providing relief to the victims. The Political Work Brigade of the Ninth War Zone also entered Changsha to handle the aftermath of the disaster area. There was also a large team of cadres from the Hunan People's Anti-Japanese War United Committee who rushed from Xiangxiang overnight (the team members were reorganized from the battlefield service corps concentratedly trained by Hunan high school students, and they were all enthusiastic young people who volunteered to serve on the front line). They all used their dragon-like and tiger-like skills to implement the four aftermath principles personally ordered by Chairman Chiang. The tense working scene at that time was simply like Changsha, whose body had just been burned to ashes by a wildfire, being revived spiritually.

First of all, the responsible persons for the fire, the Provincial Garrison Commander 　Ti, the Second Regiment Commander of the Provincial Garrison Brigade Xu Kun, and the Provincial Police Chief Wen Chongfu, etc., were arrested by the Hunan Provincial Government and sent to the Military Affairs Commission to organize a high-level military trial, sentenced to death, and executed. At the same time, the Director of Security Xu Quan was also removed from his post for investigation, and Changsha Mayor Xi Chulin was also dismissed but retained in his post. Provincial Chairman Zhang Zhizhong felt deeply guilty for misusing his subordinates and requested the central government to punish him severely. He was ordered to be dismissed but retained, and ordered to handle the aftermath. As a result, the anger of the generally affected citizens was slightly appeased.

Secondly, regarding the aftermath, the Provisional Fire Relief Committee of Changsha City was quickly formed to expand the provisional relief; the funding was determined to be 500,000 yuan (including 200,000 yuan issued by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and 300,000 yuan raised by the Hunan Provincial Government). Many disaster relief centers, temporary markets, and food distribution points were established to provide food and accommodation for the victims who did not want to leave the province; those who were not in the provincial capital, but were at the evacuation destinations registered with the Education Department before the disaster, were given 2 jiao and 5 fen of foreign currency for every 30 li of distance, plus 3 jiao of foreign currency for relief. Those who wanted to run small businesses were given loans of 10 yuan. On December 9th, a one-time emergency relief of 5 yuan was issued. It was estimated in advance that no more than 20,000 to 30,000 people would receive this emergency relief, but the result exceeded the predetermined number by about two times, and tens of thousands of yuan of relief funds were issued. In total, 110,000 victims received relief. Based on the past population of Changsha of 300,000, there were still more than 100,000 people outside the grace of the country.

Although Changsha is now mostly in ruins, due to the improvement of the front-line situation and the drive for survival, more and more people are returning to the city and building temporary houses on the ruins. In some areas, the population has increased compared to before the fire, creating a prosperous atmosphere. However, excessive concentration of population is extremely dangerous, and enemy aircraft have bombed the area once since the disaster, so the provincial government has to find ways to resettle the people.

Regarding the permanent construction agency in Changsha, the Changsha Post-Disaster Reconstruction Committee was also established. A fund of 10 million yuan was allocated from the Hunan Construction Public Bonds of the 27th year of the Republic, and construction experts have also been recruited. The first manifestation of this work is the city-wide solicitation of plans for the construction of the New Changsha District. According to Zhang Zhizhong, chairman of the committee: "However, this is still a plan, and the time is not yet right for implementation." Originally, our war against Japan will be difficult to completely resolve in the short term. All our new construction projects must be planned for a longer and more practical period. In other words, the construction of New Changsha during the war of resistance should be centered on military affairs. It should not only build a new, beautiful city with air defense facilities, but also a military fortress suitable for long-term war resistance. So as to avoid repeating the mistakes of the construction of Nanjing and Shanghai, which were ridiculed as "gardens without walls," and were trampled by beasts. Finally, what I want to describe is the truth about the cause of the fire, which is also the main point of what I want to write; although this is not an easy task. Fortunately, the cause of the fire has been investigated and announced by all parties: 1. It was caused by the local military and police officials mistakenly believing rumors, being unprepared beforehand, and being rash and flustered at the time; 2. It was because the people who had engaged in destruction preparation, and the people (members of the self-defense corps, Ding Sen, etc.), in view of the enemy aircraft's continuous bombing... aroused by national indignation, believed that the enemy was coming, and immediately set fire to their houses, which led to the preparation work turning into action. As a result, a fire broke out in one place, and it spread everywhere, until it became out of control.

In "general principles," the main cause of the Changsha fire was indeed the above two points; however, how did the facts evolve, and how was the disaster mechanism formed? It seems that it is still difficult to give a concrete answer at present. However, it is of course inappropriate for villains to take the opportunity to fabricate and spread rumors, and spread various rumors.

In fact, the strict investigation of the chief culprits of the Changsha fire, in the final analysis, is of course "Japanese ××." The huge sacrifices and losses caused by the Changsha fire should be recorded in the general account of Japanese aggression and plunder against us, and we should settle it all together in the struggle to win the war of resistance. On the other hand, the motives of those who should be held responsible for the fire on our side are "to avoid helping the enemy" and "out of indignation"... Then, tracing the original intention, their criminal behavior can be attributed to the "errors of gentlemen," which is somewhat understandable. Based on this meaning, the specific causes of the fire that I have heard, choosing the ones that are closer to reason, are generally recorded as follows:

First, our army withdrew from Yueyang on November 11, and the enemy continued to invade southward along the railway line. The next morning (12th), Changsha was filled with rumors, and people's hearts were restless. In terms of military deployment, when our army withdrew from Yueyang, the × Brigade Commander led his troops to serve as the covering force. The × Regiment Commander was ordered to lead his elite troops to attack a strong enemy position near Yueyang late at night on the 11th, and was scheduled to return to a certain place the next morning after completing a certain task. Regiment Commander × was extremely brave in combat, and this time he was determined to die. That night, he led his troops to bravely attack the enemy, advancing and retreating repeatedly, and falling forward and following each other. Finally, he broke into the enemy's position, and was about to retreat according to plan, but unexpectedly, because of the bloody battle lasting too long, it was already dawn, and enemy aircraft suddenly flew into the air to bomb wildly, and enemy artillery also concentrated on the position to bombard fiercely. As a result, Regiment Commander × and the remaining less than one-third of his remnants had no choice but to temporarily remain in the original position to cover the resistance, and waited for the enemy's firepower to weaken slightly before rushing out. The situation was helpless, and there was nothing else to do.

Brigade Commander × stayed in a certain place overnight, but still did not return after the time had passed. He was worried in his heart, and gradually had the thought of "easy to go, hard to return" for Regiment Commander × and his troops. Later, he received a report from a liaison officer that they had broken into the enemy's position, but had not come out again. As a result, he believed that the entire unit must have made a heroic sacrifice. Moreover, Brigade Commander × feared that there were not many remaining soldiers beside him. Fearing that the enemy would take advantage of the situation to cover up, he would not only be trapped in heavy siege, but also would not be able to report back. Therefore, he thought of marching 　and retreating to Miluo, and quickly reported to Changsha, and said that he had not seen our army deploying defenses along the way. What an emergency alert in Changsha! Before long, Regiment Commander × also led dozens of remnants to rush out of the enemy's position and rushed to Miluo to confront them. The reported situation was even more dangerous. As a result, they were both ordered by the Commander-in-Chief's office to return to a certain place on the front line to await orders from their direct superior and participate in the war.

It should also be pointed out here that the two urgent reports from Brigade Commander × and Regiment Commander ×, both on the night of the 12th, had a fear-inducing stimulus to the hearts of the people, which was no different from two ignition charms.

What poured oil on the ignition charms was the sudden news that × cavalry had attacked near Miluo that night!

Looking at the strategies adopted by the enemy in invading our northern and southern battlefields, in addition to often playing the two old tricks of "central breakthrough" and "outflanking encirclement," they also used a small trick: when occupying each of our central cities, they would drive dozens of Mongolian puppet light cavalry to disrupt our rear with gunshots, deliberately creating suspicious formations. They threatened our retreat. For example, when we were stalemated with the enemy in the Jin'guanqiao area of the Nanxun Road, and fierce fighting was taking place in Ruichang, a small number of enemy cavalry initially moved towards the southeastern area of Ruichang. The defending army did not understand the situation, allowing them to take the opportunity to窜into Xintangbu Minshan, threatening the southeast side of our Nanxun Road. Also, when Wuhan was withdrawing, we still had some military supplies waiting to be transported in Huayuan, but because a small group of enemy cavalry suddenly disrupted the territory of Yingshan, we were unable to transport them out in a hurry. Now, the intention of the enemy cavalry disrupting near Miluo is nothing more than this. If it succeeds, it will be a great benefit, and if it fails, it will be a small loss. Later, although the defense line north of Pingjiang Miluo was strengthened with troops, the position was stabilized, and the attacking enemy army was repelled, Changsha, which was full of fire, was unfortunately sparked by the pouring of this ruthless fire oil, and the unprecedented prairie fire broke out!

However, at the most dangerous moment before the fire, that is, when Changsha was preparing to implement destruction of military-related buildings to prevent them from being used by the enemy and it was considered to be the final juncture, there was still a most important focus: whether the culprit 鄷悌 and others had received any order related to the fire. It is said that there was no order, but there were various rumors. Moreover, 鄷悌 and others were still calling for injustice when they were executed. It is said that there was an order, but the relevant parties absolutely deny it, and there is no conclusive evidence to rely on. As the saying goes, "What is the ultimate merit and sin of the Changsha fire? It can only be left to historians to study."

One theory is that since Changsha was facing the war zone, the timing of the pre-prepared destruction was originally said to wait until the enemy had reached 30 li from Changsha before the action could begin; but 鄷悌, in his panic and eagerness, listened to the telephone and mistook 30 li for 300 li, and the distance from Miluo to Changsha happened to be 300 li, and thus made a big mistake.

In wartime, the methods used to transmit orders, such as telegrams, telephones, flag signals, sound signals, notes, and verbal instructions, each have advantages and disadvantages. During the Xuzhou Battle in the past, a certain engineer team suddenly received a telephone call from its superiors one afternoon, ordering it to "bake tofu and fried dough sticks" at that time; the team did not know why, and after further inquiry, it turned out to be a mistake for "bombing Bengbu Yangqiao." Also, Mr. Feng ×× once convened a meeting of officers above the rank of major in a certain army in Nanyang for a training session, and ordered each to bring "Tactics" (book title), but later the messenger mistakenly heard each to bring "family members," which led to the joke that the trainees actually brought their wives to the lecture hall together. By analogy, it is difficult to believe that the mistake of 300 li for 30 li is certain, but it is not impossible.

A certain commander casually mentioned the Changsha fire in a casual conversation on a certain occasion, and said indifferently: The death of 鄷悌 and others was not without sacrifice for their duties. He then turned to his subordinates and continued: In the military, when there are important orders or reports, it is best to execute them based on documents, or at least record them at the time to prevent errors, and so on. Although the words are irrelevant, they are not without purpose.

Mr. Tian Han, deputy director of the Changsha Fire Relief Committee, said about the fire: "Today, we must put the war of resistance first. There is no need to make useless complaints afterwards, so as not to distract our attention from the Japanese aggressors, and we should make the most of our efforts in the difficult task of cleaning up the broken bricks and tiles... so that Changsha can still play an important supporting role in the rear of the war of resistance." His words are heartfelt, and I cannot help but feel the same.

### Our Counter-Offensive in Hebei and Shandong is Going Smoothly / The Enemy is Busy and Chaotic with Troop Movements / The Battle in Hubei is Still Fierce and Stalemate

[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Bureau on the 26th] News compiled on the evening of the 25th: There are no changes in the overall war situation. The enemy is still busy with troop movements and deployments in the valley. Major battles in South China and Northwest China are brewing. The enemy's attacks on us in the occupied areas such as Hebei and Shandong are still fierce, but due to our successful counter-offensive, the situation has stabilized. According to a telegram from Guilin, the number of enemy troops that have arrived on Hainan Island is still less than two divisions to date and are still urgently invading our inland areas. Enemy aircraft are constantly flying low and bombing various places on the island every day, seemingly focusing on attacking our guerrilla forces in the coastal counties, attempting to quickly establish a puppet regime and build air and naval bases, and further attempting to cut off our communication with the island. However, with the cooperation of the military and civilians, we have also created many heroic achievements and inflicted great blows on the enemy. It is absolutely impossible for the enemy to occupy the entire island in the short term as they claim. The local battles in central Hubei are still fierce, and our troops and the enemy are in a stalemate near Tianmen and Jingshan. In western Shanxi, we are besieging Xiaxian and have gained a lot of ×獲. The railway on the Tongpu Line has been damaged and cut off in many places by us. The enemy in Yuncheng is attempting to invade westward, and we have taken strict precautions.

[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Bureau on the 26th] Telegram from Guilin: The battle situation on Hainan Island is still fierce. The enemy continues to invade inland along the highway in Wenchang, Anding, and Chengmai. After our interception, there have been many casualties. Enemy aircraft are still constantly bombing the island. The enemy in southern Guangdong is still busy with troop movements.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 26th] On the morning of the 24th, more than 100 enemy infantry, with two artillery pieces, went to Taipingchang, Huangniguo, Yinxi Cave, and Shiqianshi to search for food ××. They were attacked by our guerrillas along the way and suffered heavy casualties. They then retreated to Taipingchang in defeat.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 26th] There were 400 enemy troops in Shilong. Wen Zhongping, the pseudo-maintenance chairman of Liaobu, was assassinated by local patriotic villagers on the 21st.

[Our Chongqing Bureau, 26th] Telegram from Luoyang: Our strength in the occupied areas of Hebei, Shandong, and Chahar has increased, and we can control the overall situation in the future. The enemy's plan to clear the occupied areas will become a bubble. Our politics are being actively promoted under the principle of adapting to the war of resistance.

[Special Dispatch from Our Xi'an Bureau on the 29th] More than 500 enemy troops attacked Songgang, Lixian on the 24th and are currently engaged in a fierce battle. The enemy intends to attack Suning again.

[Our Chongqing Bureau, 25th] It is reported that the enemy on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is concentrating food and military supplies in Xuzhou, attempting to invade westward. The enemy on the Nanxun Line is recently forcibly recruiting laborers to repair roads, attempting to attack Nanchang. Our army has strict deployments on these lines. If the enemy invades, they will be severely hit.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] News from Tianjin: The enemy has been publicizing an encirclement battle in central Hebei. Recent battle reports show that the enemy has been besieged by us in Nangong, Jixian, and Juye. Our guerrillas have repeatedly achieved victories. Our army adopts a strategy of "clearing the fields and strengthening the walls" after the enemy arrives, 　围 from all sides. When the enemy entered Nangong City, there was no rice or firewood, and no place to find water, and the enemy's supply line was cut off. Therefore, after a few days, the enemy could not stand and窜去 in full numbers. The enemy's losses were very heavy. In the recent battle in the Jixian area of Shanxi, the enemy's losses exceeded those of the Pingxingguan campaign, it is said.

[Central News Agency, Zhongxiang, 26th] The purpose of the enemy's recent westward invasion in central Hubei is to expand the security line on the southern side of the Pinghan Railway, consolidate 　 defense of various strongholds, and prevent our counter-offensive. Recently, although they have constantly sent small units to take advantage of opportunities to invade, they are also guerrilla in nature. They retreat immediately when we counterattack. Currently, the right wing front line is still confronting near the Yuekou檄厂集.

### Suiyuan Unable to Control; Mongol Puppet Troops Waver; After Reorganization, Only Several Thousand Remain in the German-Li Puppet Troops; Guisui Traitors Hiding in the City Are Panic-Stricken

[Central News Agency, Hequ, 20th] A person arriving from Guisui states that the puppet army's strength in Suiyuan is extremely weak. Constantly fearing attacks from our guerrilla forces, sandbags are piled up at every remote alley entrance, blocking traffic. Defenses are only set up and maintained at major thoroughfares. A broadcasting machine is installed on the old city drum tower, and communication personnel are stationed in villages within a dozen or so *li*. In case of emergency, lights are immediately used as signals, and the broadcasting machine reports the news to the soldiers and civilians of both cities, who quickly prepare for defense. Because of insufficient troops, Japanese and Korean merchants are conscripted during the day and formed into guard teams at night. Due to financial constraints, a dismissal and reorganization meeting was convened a month ago, and the Mongol puppet troops were greatly reduced in number. Although the German Wang and Li Shou-xin rebel factions are nominally called ten divisions, they actually only number several thousand. After the reorganization, their numbers were further reduced. Furthermore, the Mongol puppet troops were ordered to be organized separately and not to be mixed or connected, for fear that their strength would be too great to control. The two traitors, German Wang and Li, and the puppet Mongol troops are very resentful of these measures and may revolt at any time. The puppet army's strength in each county is also very weak. Although reinforcements are sent from time to time, ostensibly to increase defenses, in reality, this is just a consistent deception tactic. Everywhere, one sees emptiness and panic. The highest political organizations are nominally the puppet Mongol Autonomous Government and Provincial Government, with German Wang as a puppet. However, another office is set up, entirely controlled by the Japanese, who wield real administrative power. The *tuanwei* (local defense corps) and police organized by local gentry in each county have recently been changed, replaced by trusted Han traitors of the Japanese. This can be described as "once the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked," serving as a warning to those who willingly act as Han traitors. Because our guerrilla forces are lying in ambush in the suburbs, the puppet regime's decrees are currently difficult to implement outside the city gates, leaving them at a loss. In recent months, the puppet regime has twice launched large-scale encirclements of the Daqingshan Mountains, attempting to destroy the bases of our guerrilla forces, but ultimately failing to achieve their goals. Therefore, they have recently intensified their efforts, employing both hard and soft tactics, driving residents along the Ping-Sui railway line and both sides of the highway to move to areas designated by the puppet regime. Those who disobey the order are slaughtered, intending to "strengthen the walls and clear the fields" to control the lurking activities of our guerrilla forces. These desperate actions of the puppet regime are in vain and will ultimately be of no avail.

### ×Planes Bomb Coastal Areas of Fujian and Zhejiang

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 25th] At noon on the 25th, three ×planes flew from Guangdong along the coastal areas. Air raid alerts were issued in more than twenty counties in southeastern Fujian. The planes turned south and flew out to sea at about 8:00 AM.

[Central News Agency, Lianxian, 26th] One ×plane attacked Huiyang on the afternoon of the 26th, dropping four bombs and injuring two people. Also, at 1:50 PM on the afternoon of the 26th, four ×planes attacked Xuwen, dropping eight bombs, which landed at Tongren Hospital, fortunately without causing any injuries.

### North China ×Panic-Stricken; Compelling Japanese to Return Home

[Minge News Agency, Xingji, 26th] The ×Commander of North China has recently issued a secret order to all Japanese businessmen, students, and travelers staying in North China, except for those on official missions, to return to their country before March of this year.

### U.S. Maintains a Strong Stance to Protect Interests in China; Tensions High Among U.S. Consulate Staff; ×To Submit Another Note to the Shanghai Municipal Council

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Shanghai dispatch: Regarding the Japanese demands, sources familiar with the matter say that the U.S. Consulate is taking an increasingly firm stance against Japan. The details of this incident have not been announced by relevant parties, but U.S. Consul General Gauss and many consulate staff members are now working late into the night, exchanging telegrams with Washington frequently, resembling the situation during the "January 28th" and "August 13th" incidents in Shanghai.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] Shanghai dispatch: The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a public announcement at 8:00 PM tonight that Municipal Council Chairman Fessenden visited Japanese Consul General Miura at 6:00 PM this afternoon and personally delivered the Council's reply to the Japanese demands of the 21st. This reply is currently under study by the Japanese diplomatic, naval, and military authorities. Japan is scheduled to submit another note on the 27th.

### Tianjin ×Adopts Provocative Posture Toward U.S. Troops

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 25th] Tianjin dispatch: × and the British have decided to implement a second blockade of the French Concession in Tianjin. On the 24th, Tianjin × convened a meeting of relevant personnel and urged them to handle the matter as soon as possible. The specific methods have been largely determined and will be even stricter than before.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Tianjin dispatch: Japanese troops are erecting electric fences and barriers between the Special District (former German Concession) and the British Concession. Since the barracks of the U.S. Marine Corps are located near the Special District, this move by the Japanese actually surrounds the U.S. barracks with barriers, indicating that the Japanese's main objective is clearly to deal with the U.S. troops. According to the Japanese Consulate authorities, the Japanese are erecting electric fences around the U.S. Navy barracks to facilitate naval operations. How this statement should be interpreted is unclear to all. The Japanese Consulate claims that this action is unrelated to the new foreign exchange control law that the authorities in North China and Japan are scheduled to implement on March 11. However, in fact, many citizens here are rushing to buy National Government *fapi* currency to purchase foreign exchange before March 11.

### Japanese Sentry Forcibly Seizes Mail; Soviet Consul Lodges Protest

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Hankou dispatch: The Soviet Consulate General here has protested to the Japanese Consul General, stating that on the 24th, a Chinese postman was delivering mail to the Consulate General when a Japanese sentry seized the mail at the entrance.

### Jiangnan Guerrilla Troops Attack Suzhou; Stage Demonstration in Pudong

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Shanghai dispatch: Along the Jing-Hu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway line, our guerrilla forces launched an attack on Suzhou during the Lunar New Year. On the morning of February 20th, they briefly recovered Likou, less than 30 kilometers from Suzhou, and captured countless spoils of war. As they advanced towards the city, Qing Bai Hong national flags were discovered on the 21st and 22nd at Qimen. National flags were also flying on all bridges along the Suzhou-Shanghai highway, apparently raised by our guerrilla forces as they passed through. Furthermore, our troops blew up various bridges during their passage to cut off the transportation of × troops.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] Shanghai dispatch: Because of frequent incidents of the guerrilla forces confiscating weapons, the Pudong puppet police have confiscated all firearms, and the puppet police are now standing guard empty-handed. At around 4:00 PM on the 25th, about seventy or eighty of our guerrilla forces, all carrying light weapons, paraded and demonstrated on the main streets of Pudong, shouting slogans such as "Down with Japanese Imperialism!" At that time, the puppet police, lacking real strength, pretended not to see them. Even the Japanese soldiers in the Takabashi area and the Japanese warships anchored on the river did not dare to move slightly, showing that the Japanese puppets are no longer able to control the situation.

### China-Britain Air Route To Open Tomorrow

[Reuters, Chongqing, February 26th] China is endeavouring to improve communications with Burma in view of the fact that the majority of seaports are in Japanese hands. A passenger and mail carrying air service between Chongqing and Rangoon will commence on Tuesday, with a weekly service thereafter from Chongqing. The Chinese authorities are also making the fullest possible use of the recently completed Burma Road, with drivers and mechanical personnel being trained on a large scale, and animal drawn transport being prepared.

### Test Flight Arrives Back in Yunnan

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 26th] The No. 7 Picket-Crawford aircraft of the Sino-British maiden voyage returned from Rangoon on the 26th.

It will continue to fly to Chongqing at 9:00 AM on the 27th. According to our pilot, Tan Huanjun, the flight was very smooth, and the weather changes were not severe. However, the conditions during the rainy season are still unpredictable. After our aircraft arrived in Rangoon, it received a warm welcome from the local overseas Chinese, and the locals also expressed their welcome, believing that this move would greatly promote Sino-British relations.

### Chinese Institute of Engineers Holds General Meeting in Chongqing; Chen Lifu and Others Deliver Speeches

### Since the Start of the War, ×Planes Lost Exceed One Thousand; Average Monthly Loss is 56 Planes; 24 Planes Have Been Destroyed This Year

[Central News Agency, ××, 26th] An Air Force spokesperson told reporters that the ×Headquarters announced on January 20th of the 28th year (1939) that since the start of the invasion war until December 31st of the 27th year (1938), a total of 710 army and navy aircraft were lost. Another 300 were damaged beyond repair, totaling 1,010 aircraft. The results of verification and our statistics coincide. Of these, 221 were shot down in the air by our Air Force, 179 were destroyed by our Air Force bombing, 88 were shot down by our anti-aircraft units, 107 were destroyed by our army attacks, 11 were destroyed by our artillery, 19 ×planes landed on their own, and 27 were shot down by us but their whereabouts are unknown, or severely damaged and forced to land in × territory, totaling 647. In addition, based on the minimum damage rate due to flight accidents, an estimated 363 aircraft (the actual number is certainly more than this), totaling 1,010 aircraft, with an average monthly loss of more than 56 aircraft, can be said to be an extremely heavy loss. Since the beginning of the 28th year (1939), 24 aircraft have been shot down or destroyed by our Air Force, anti-aircraft artillery, and army units. Among them, our brave Air Force warriors shot down 15 of the latest and most advanced heavy bombers recently purchased from Europe and the West over Lanzhou, giving the ×Air Force a serious blow.

[Reuters, Beiping, 26th] A Japanese military spokesperson recently admitted that during a recent Japanese air raid on Lanzhou, a fierce air battle took place with the Chinese Air Force. As a result, three Japanese aircraft were shot down, killing three sergeants and fifteen aviators. It is said that one aircraft was also shot down during the raid on Lanzhou on the 20th.

### President Kong Reports at the National Political Council; International Situation Improves; Continued from Yesterday

—One of the March Political Reports—

The international situation will inevitably become more perilous. People with vision in various countries, seeing this point, all want to unite, pool their wisdom and efforts, and find ways to salvage the situation. The World Anti-Aggression Conference was formed in this way. Last summer, American civilians initiated a "Committee Against Participation in Japanese Aggression Actions," with the aim of encouraging the American people to voluntarily refrain from providing Japan with tools of aggression. Because although merchants may not intend to participate in aggression, supplying Japan with tools of aggression is actually equivalent to participating. This association is a civilian movement in the United States, unrelated to the government. Their starting point is not treaty obligations or national interests, but individual conscience and righteous indignation. Recently, Mr. Stimson has taken on the role of honorary president, and their work will surely become more active and effective. The Japanese *zaibatsu* may despise such actions based on conscience and righteous indignation, but we are fighting for peace and justice. Our victory or defeat is not determined by temporary advances or retreats on the battlefield. Moral victory is the foundation of our ultimate victory and a sign of our ultimate victory.

The improvement in the international situation is, of course, due to the unity, sincerity, loyalty, and bravery of our entire military and civilians under the leadership of the Supreme Commander. The Japanese government's ambition, which has become even more evident since the statement was issued, is also a very important reason. When the September 18th Incident first occurred, we announced to the world that it was the beginning of Japan's unlimited ambition. However, the world's observation of us was always half-believing and half-doubting, thinking that our propaganda was inevitably exaggerated. When we withdrew from Wuhan and the interests of the lower Yangtze River were monopolized by the ×people, and Konoe and Arita formally declared the true face of the Japanese government, various countries' governments and people finally understood the treachery, and their attitudes naturally changed accordingly. Chairman Chiang has already announced his views on the Konoe-Arita statement on December 26th. I don't need to repeat his words. But what we want to specifically point out is that the Chairman's views coincide with the notes of the British, American, and French governments. For example, the Chairman said, "If China recognizes Konoe's 'New Order in East Asia' and 'Japan-Manchuria-China Cooperative Relations,' it would be turning all of China's territory into a large concession owned by Japan." The conclusion of the British note also said, "His Majesty's Government cannot understand how Prince Konoe can declare that Japan does not want China to cede territory and respects Chinese sovereignty, while at the same time saying that Japan must forcibly impose conditions on China that have no other effect than to place China's political, economic, and cultural life completely under Japanese control, allowing Japanese troops to be stationed in China indefinitely, and almost completely separating Inner Mongolia from China." In a broadcast speech on November 3rd, Konoe said that the Sino-Japanese war "is a tragedy of fratricide." This statement makes sense, but who caused the tragedy between China and Japan? Whose fault is it that the tragedy continues to unfold? This responsibility, needless to say, should be borne by the militarists of Japan. In recent years, the Japanese have often liked to present themselves as protectors of Eastern civilization, wanting to use the name of Eastern culture to appeal and attempt to organize an Eastern bloc to deal with Europe and America. But in this war, what is the purpose and what are the means of Japan? Where is the element of civilization, and where is the spirit of Eastern civilization? In fact, China is the source of Eastern civilization. Japanese culture was given to them by China. Now our resistance to Japanese aggression is fulfilling our responsibility to protect the culture of the East. Last month, a professor at Oxford University said in a letter to Chairman Chiang, "British people used to have some doubts about the true meaning and value of Chinese culture and scholarship. But today, on the one hand, in view of the tyranny and hatred of narrow nationalism, and on the other hand, in view of the solemn and composed attitude of China's anti-Japanese stance, we can no longer doubt who is the leader of world culture." This is the judgment of famous scholars in the world regarding the leadership of culture. Japanese enlightened people, after reading this, I wonder what they would think.

Upon careful examination, the reason why Japanese propagandists are so eager to talk about cultural issues at this tense time of war is nothing more than two purposes. First, they want to use the confrontation between Eastern and Western cultures to drive out the forces of Europe and America in East Asia, create a Japanized New Order in East Asia, and complete their dream of a "Manchuria-Japan-China" linkage - a whole set of tricks. Without knowing that Eastern culture is the spiritual heritage passed down by our ancestors for thousands of years, we should of course do our best to promote and carry it forward. But the way to promote it cannot be to be complacent and self-enclosed, nor can it be to fabricate a situation of East-West confrontation. We firmly believe that communication between Eastern and Western cultures is beneficial to both sides. The Japanese should not forget their history of the Meiji Restoration. The so-called Meiji Restoration was to accept Western civilization, such as science, engineering, and constitutional government, on the basis of Eastern civilization. If it were not for the enlightened people of Japan in the Meiji era who humbly accepted Western civilization, Japan would probably still be in the dark age of the shogunate division of politics. Now Japan has turned around and rejected Western civilization. Konoe even said that the discord between China and Japan was caused by the influence of the reactionary tide after the European war. But which is reactionary, China or Japan?

The second slogan of the Japanese propagandists is joint anti-communism. They believe that by raising the banner of anti-communism or defense against communism, they can confuse the world's perception and make the world believe that their war of aggression is a war against communism. In fact, now who doesn't know that the Japanese warlords have only the plunder of China's resources in their minds, and there is no such thing as any kind of *ism*. Does a nation with a history and an *ism* need external instigation to fight for its own survival?

Before the outbreak of this war, China tried hard to avoid it, but could not avoid it. Then what other method do we have besides resistance? Now the new Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma declares that Japan must invade to the end based on its established national policy. I also do not hesitate to repeat that China must resist to the end based on its established national policy.

Based on the above, the exposure of ×people's conspiracies and the changes in the international situation in the recent three months, our future response to diplomacy, besides making every effort to respond to ×people based on our established national policy, we should especially pay attention to propaganda, trying to awaken the Japanese people, making them understand the crisis of their own country, stopping their suicidal actions, in order to restore peace in East Asia as soon as possible. To various countries, we should cultivate good relations based on the ancient training of repaying kindness with kindness and repaying injustice with justice, so that those who are close to us will be more helpful to us, and the friendship of those who are distant from us will gradually increase, in order to harmonize all nations and promote international cooperation. To the repeated resolutions of the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, we should urge them to be implemented as much as possible. To the necessary laws and order in the international community, as well as the dignity of treaties, we should consult with relevant countries and make joint efforts to maintain them.

Although the international situation has improved, we must still make our greatest efforts at all times and never have a mind to rely on luck. The Anti-War and National Reconstruction Program formulated by the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang last year, the so-called simultaneous advancement of anti-war and national reconstruction, is because national reconstruction is not possible without resistance to Japan's aggression. So this time the anti-war can be called the war of national reconstruction in the future history. Secondly, because during the anti-war period, all facilities should strive to conform to the country's century-long plan, we cannot follow the old ways or get by with what we have. Our work in this great era must take into account the present and the future, and must be beneficial to the anti-war as well as national reconstruction. (To be continued, the following is the domestic affairs section)

### Visiting Old Mrs. Zhao

— Mu Lin

【Special Air Dispatch from Kunming】A struggling China has produced countless heroic warriors—a great China has created countless great historical achievements!

Recalling the Northeast after its fall, countless heroic men and women emerged, running between the mountains and rivers, constantly striking the enemy. In the rural areas of Xiuyan County, Liaoning Province, the roar of those unwilling to be slaves erupted: "Treat resistance as life, and the guerrilla隊 as family." From February of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932) to the present, Old Mrs. Zhao has led her family, responding to the enemy's brutal aggression with bullets and bayonets. She has traveled from beyond the Pass to North China, then from North China to Central China, then to South China, then to Southeast Asia, and then to Annam. What is the reason for this? To fight for the motherland and win glory. Furthermore, she has not only made the compatriots in the places she has been to see the ferocious faces of Eastern fascist enemy, but also made the compatriots in the places she has passed through see the victorious future of resisting the Japanese and building the nation.

On the evening of February 2nd, Old Mrs. Zhao Hongwenguo, accompanied by Wang Aiqun of the Northeast National Salvation General Association and Wang Yue, two subordinates of Zhao Tong's troops, arrived in Kunming. This resounding bell, this "mother of the guerrilla隊," this female revolutionary warrior, this reporter had the opportunity to meet her. It was like seeing the red light of a torch, and starting to talk with her was like hearing the sound of a loud bell.

Old Mrs. Zhao is very short in stature, with bronze-colored skin and wrinkles covering her face, showing the brave traces of her struggle. The felt hat she wears and the qipao she wears are both as dark as iron. Her front teeth have fallen out, and her temples are as frosty as snow. She is already fifty-eight years old. However, shining on her face is the color of youth, and filled in her eyes is a sharp light. On her body, we cannot see the slightest sign of aging; on the contrary, contained in her body is strength! Strength! Strength! The strength of a young person, the strength of copper and iron!

She first said to the reporter: "Since the 'September 18th Incident,' when the Japanese occupied the Northeast, I didn't know anything, I only knew that Japan wanted to destroy our China, and Japan is my enemy! So I donated my family property and risked my life to organize a guerrilla隊 to strike the enemy, because I thought, who will protect those who have lost their country! Only each person with a knife or a gun can protect themselves, otherwise... I am already fifty-eight years old, what else is there to think about!" She took a sip of tea and loudly continued: "I don't want to be a family mother, I want to be a mother to the masses, so I organized the guerrilla隊. My children and grandchildren, a total of more than thirty people, I sent them all into the guerrilla隊, because I think every mother should send her children to the front line to fight with the enemy, and every mother should also join the front line." Old Mrs. Zhao said here, and the gentlemen present all applauded. The old lady said even louder: "Since young people have gone to the front line, what are we old people still living for? Everyone thinks that the rear is safe, and runs towards the rear as much as possible, but is the rear really safe? In many places I have been, I often see corpses strewn across the fields, all sent to their deaths by the brutal enemy. Aren't those in the rear, why were they bombed to death? I think if they had gone to the front line, perhaps it would not be like this. I have been in the guerrilla隊 for a full seven years, from the Northeast to North China to Central China, and South China, but I have not died!" She laughed twice very proudly, and continued: "We don't want to die in bed, we don't want to die at home, we don't want to die in the rear, we go to the front line! Who knows that the front line will not necessarily make us die! Everyone must kill a Japanese person, and if they sacrifice, it counts as fulfilling their responsibility for the country. If they shed blood, then they are the descendants of the Republic of China! Everyone must fight enemy imperialism and resist to the end, this is what everyone knows, but many people only shout slogans and do not act. Therefore, these people are discovered by the enemy and considered hateful, so planes and artillery are fired at them all at once. I am not like that, I want to fire bullets into the Japanese body before I make a sound!" At this time, her voice became even higher and asked the reporter if he agreed with her opinion. Just as the reporter excitedly replied to her question and uttered the word "yes," she said again with great energy: "When I went to Southeast Asia, many overseas Chinese came to welcome me. Among them, most were important figures. I told them that your grand welcome to me really makes me feel very uncomfortable, because although I have been fighting with the enemy since 1918, but seven years have passed without any result, and the country is now in danger. I have come here not to ask you for money, nor to publicize to you, I have come here to bring you the news that the motherland is in danger, hoping that you will hurry back to save the country. The compatriots in Southeast Asia are also very concerned about the War of Resistance and are working hard. At that time, many of them wanted to return to China with me to join the guerrilla隊, but due to various reasons, I could not allow them..."

The reporter then asked her about the recent guerrilla situation in the Northeast. She responded: "The righteous volunteer guerrilla隊 in the Northeast are rushing to the front line to strike the enemy. The guerrilla隊 in North China are fighting in the vicinity of Ping. Since the fall of the Northeast seven years ago, the guerrilla隊 I have organized number about 20,000 people, fighting in the Northeast and North China, from the Changbai Mountains to the Taihang Mountains. My wish is for everyone to unite, regardless of party affiliation, regardless of North or South, and everyone support the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. I have been preaching everywhere for several years, preaching the way to defeat enemy imperialism..." Her angry expression gradually became tense, and her wrinkles changed in blocks, further discussing her family's heroic story of resisting the enemy. The loud voice conveyed the brave historical achievements, making the reporter feel like listening to a great recitation poem. The more she spoke, the more energetic she became, and the more I listened, the more absorbed I became. I felt that the person talking to me was not Old Mrs. Zhao, but Dolores Ibárruri of Spain, or perhaps Chelidona of Sparta, or even Gorky's "Mother"! Pelageya Nilovna Vlasova.

At this time, Old Mrs. Zhao continued to talk to the reporter about the causes and consequences of the Northeast Incident, and also recounted the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, as well as the reasons for the failure of the Taiwan resistance led by General Liu Yongfu. Her conclusion was: "Because at that time our China did not mobilize the masses, we ended up bearing the great yoke of slavery of the 'Treaty of Shimonoseki'!" After severely criticizing the traitorous remarks of Wang Jingwei and his ilk of so-called "traveling without fighting," she said again, "All Chinese people should stand up and stand on the front lines of resisting the enemy and saving the country, and use our flesh and blood to defend the motherland's territory, do not be lazy, do not steal peace! And do not hesitate! The responsibility of those of you who use your pens to participate in the War of Resistance is even greater than the responsibility of those who take up guns to participate in the War of Resistance!" When the reporter shook hands with her to say goodbye, she specially and solemnly spoke these precious words.

Learn from Old Mrs. Zhao's spirit of struggle, and use the action of struggle to put into practice the correct instructions she gave us!

### Western Republican Government Accepts British Proposal, Prepares to Negotiate End to Civil War; France Signs Agreement with Franco

[Central News Agency, Paris, 25th] After the British government decided in principle to recognize the Franco government, it immediately entrusted the Western Republican government's ambassador to Britain, Asgarate, to make a proposal to the authorities in Madrid, asking them to stop the war. The Republican government's foreign minister, Talba育, came here today to talk with the country's president, A省納, for a long time. According to informed sources here, Foreign Minister Talba育 submitted a report to the president, saying that the cabinet meeting had decided to accept the British government's proposal to stop the war in preparation for negotiations with Franco's army to end the civil war. The fact that President A省納 will resign tomorrow has been confirmed by Western Republican government officials here. It is said that A省納 will issue a declaration before his departure, stating that the decision of Britain and France to recognize the Franco government is the reason for his resignation.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 26th] It is rumored that Spanish Republican President A省納 has left the Western Embassy here to go to 薩和, but the Western Embassy denied this yesterday afternoon. It is generally believed that A省納 will soon leave Paris. Regarding the future transfer of the Spanish Embassy to representatives of the Franco government, it is not expected that difficulties will arise. If A省納 leaves for another destination, Spanish Ambassador 馬田尼齊 will also withdraw immediately with all his staff.

[Haitong News Agency, Geneva, 26th] The delegation of the Spanish Republican government stationed here at the League of Nations left the country on the direct express train to Paris on Saturday morning.

[Reuters, Burgos, 26th] A communiqué was issued here stating, "The talks between French parliamentarian 比拉德 and General 佐登納 were held in an atmosphere of mutual understanding and proceeded smoothly, enabling several outstanding issues between the two countries to be resolved satisfactorily." 比拉德 also left for his country after signing an agreement with the Franco government, believing that the task entrusted to him by the French government had come to an end.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 26th] Franco government Foreign Minister 佐登納 and French special envoy 比拉德 signed an agreement in Burgos yesterday. The contents of the agreement have not been officially announced, but it is believed to be related to France's recognition of the Franco government, the handling of Spanish refugee issues, and the return of gold and armaments stored in France. After signing the agreement, 佐登納 immediately reported to General Franco by telephone.

[Reuters, Burgos, 29th] 比拉德, the representative of the French government who went to the Franco government for negotiations, spoke with Franco by phone this afternoon and then set off to return to Paris. Before his departure, 比拉德 and Franco government Foreign Minister General 佐登納 signed three documents, and complete coordination has been achieved.

[Central News Agency, Andaye City, Southern France, 25th] French Senator 比拉德 signed an agreement with Franco government Prime Minister and Foreign Minister General 佐登納 at noon today. The content is divided into three protocols, which have firmly decided the establishment of diplomatic relations between France and the Franco government. 比拉德 returned to this place from Burgos City at 8 pm and immediately took a car to the city of 聯往翰德呂士, used a long-distance telephone to report everything to Foreign Minister 龐萊, and then returned to Paris at 10 pm.

[Haitong News Agency, Burgos, 26th] The Spanish Franco government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Saturday that the Bolivian government of South America has formally recognized the Franco government as the sole regime in Spain.

[Reuters, London, 25th] According to sources in London, Franco has submitted to British representative in Burgos, 赫哲森, written guarantees regarding the issue of retaliation and the maintenance of Spanish integrity. The document contains the policies of the Spanish National Army, but does not undertake any commitment or request recognition of the Spanish National Army government as an exchange condition. It states that after the Spanish National Army completely occupies Spain, except for criminals, those captured will not be subject to retaliatory treatment. At the same time, maintaining the integrity of Spanish territory is the position of the Spanish government. Although this type of written guarantee differs slightly from the original intention of the British government, London officials expressed satisfaction with this guarantee. It is believed that when the Spanish National Army appoints an ambassador to the UK in the future, 亞爾巴, who has been stationed in London since the outbreak of the Spanish War, will be the natural first ambassador.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 25th] The British government has already drafted a document recognizing the Spanish National Army and is currently storing it temporarily in the Foreign Office, pending delivery to the Spanish National Army representative in London, 亞爾巴, on Sunday. It is expected that Prime Minister Chamberlain will make a special speech on the Spanish issue in the House of Commons on Sunday. When the document recognizing the Spanish National Army is delivered to 亞爾巴, Chamberlain will simultaneously instruct British representative stationed in Burgos 赫哲森 to inform Franco of Britain's intention to recognize the Spanish National Army. Because of the issues arising from the recognition of the Spanish National Army, the British ambassador and chargé d'affaires stationed in the Spanish government army will lose their diplomatic status. Therefore, the British government must find a proper solution to entrust all the benefits enjoyed by Britain within the Spanish government army to the British Consul for full responsibility. This move is also very possible.

### Britain Prepares to Allocate £10 Million for Trade War with Dictatorial Nations; Britain and Germany to Hold Trade Negotiations

[London, 25th] The British government is prepared at any time to allocate tens of millions of pounds for the cost of protecting trade, if there is no possibility of understanding with the dictatorial nations, that is, if the dictatorial nations do not stop their policy of dumping cheap labor, then this move is imperative. For example, if a German car sells for 100 pounds abroad, a British car will reduce the price to 90 pounds. Another example is that if a Japanese cotton coat sells for one shilling, the British charge six pence. In order to maintain foreign trade, Britain will not hesitate to use all its strength to counter it. The biggest problem in this is the automobile industry. Britain and Germany are currently competing fiercely in the world vehicle market. However, the German car production rate has obviously increased greatly, and Britain cannot but worry about it. Today, the capital of thousands of British merchants and the lives of thousands of workers are on the verge of danger. Unless the two countries can conclude an agreement, Britain and Germany will inevitably flow into a bitter trade war until Germany's financial resources are exhausted. It is heard that most German industrialists hope to establish an agreement with Britain to stabilize market prices, but unfortunately the Nazi left wing insists that Germany alone should control the world market. This single individual is the most dangerous element. Dr. Fink, who was recently appointed as the German economic dictator, knows that Germany cannot use more than 60 million pounds for trade war needs. On the contrary, Britain can double it and have more than enough. This is the reason why Fink is willing to negotiate with the United Kingdom. As for Hitler's recent loud cry, "We must export goods, otherwise we will only die," this is not a challenge, but a mournful cry for help. If a trade war is not carried out immediately, the British are absolutely certain of victory, because Britain's financial resources, apart from the United States, are more abundant than any other country in the world. British and German representatives will soon convene trade negotiations in Berlin, and this fact is an unforgettable image in the minds of every representative. Sir ラック is the head of the British delegation, and the above-mentioned facts are also the key to his victory. In the process of negotiations, the British side hopes that every industry will seek a uniform sales route and a uniform market price. This Berlin negotiation will have a significant impact on European peace, because Britain has long decided that if the negotiations unfortunately break down, the government will subsidize exporters with a huge amount of money, the amount of which is unprecedented in various countries, and the manufacturing standards of British industry will also be tightened accordingly. All waste or excess will be avoided. At the same time, some industries can reduce styles and concentrate on mass production, which can reduce costs.

### US Labor Movement, Roosevelt Conducts Unification, Letters of Persuasion to Green and Lewis

### Papal Conclave to be Held Day After Tomorrow, Candidates Difficult to Predict

[Reuters, Vatican, 25th] The Papal Conclave will be held in the Vatican Palace starting on Wednesday. Approximately 300 bishops and attendants will participate. The conference will last for about four days. When the conference opens, participants will be isolated from the outside world, and all windows in the Vatican will be closed, pending the election of the Pope. Regarding the new Pope, there is much speculation here. Some quarters believe that the position of Pope will belong to the Italians, but the liberal and conservative factions of the church policy will inevitably compete. The liberals support Bishop 巴士里, while the conservatives advocate Bishop 拉維特羅. If the election undergoes changes, and if the two sides are deadlocked, it may be changed to elect pure church figures Bishop 士特 as the Pope. However, these speculations are not certain, and there may still be unexpected results.

### Penang Implements Increased Defense, British Heavy Artillery Team and Indian Army to Depart Day After Tomorrow to Prevent Attacks from the Indian Ocean Side; US to Consider Philippine Islands Issue

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 26th] British military authorities have decided to begin deploying the Penang fortress on March 1st. The island is located in northern Malaya and is the gateway to the Indian Ocean and the Straits Settlements. Its geographical position is extremely important and is a natural fortress. In the past, the British military authorities were very worried because there were no fortress fortifications in this place, making it easy to break through.

[Reuters, Singapore, 2穴th] The new Penang fortress in northern Malaya is designed to prevent attacks from the Indian Ocean. Starting next Wednesday, heavy artillery teams and British Indian troops will be sent from Singapore to defend it. The geographical situation of Penang is an ideal place to set up a fortress. Military points are now fortified, and British people are sincerely afraid that the island will be attacked after the outbreak of war.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 26th] According to foreign observers here, the US House of Representatives' rejection of the Guam fortification plan has actually led Japan to change its "easing policy" towards foreign concessions in China. It is found that the Japanese government paid close attention to the US House of Representatives' heated discussion on the Guam fortification and the British House of Commons' fierce debate on Far East affairs. In order to avoid "bad effects of expanding the situation," the Japanese army showed "some goodwill" towards the Tianjin, Hankou, and Shanghai concessions, and at least did not dare to take excessively active actions. Now that the US Congress has rejected the Guam fortification plan, Japan has seen through the weaknesses of China and the US. Therefore, 24 hours after the news of the US Congress's rejection of the Guam fortification plan came out, the Japanese army in Tianjin immediately built fortifications in the US Navy defense zone and surrounded it. At the same time, similar fortifications were built in the former German concession and the British concession. These measures taken by the Japanese army have obviously exceeded the scope of "necessity." In other words, the actions of the US Congress are tantamount to directly giving the Japanese army supreme encouragement. According to the US Navy, although the US Congress rejected the Guam fortification plan, it has no impact on other naval plans. The US government will consider the issue of the Philippines, because this issue is the focus of the United States' Far East policy.

### Italian-Polish Cultural Relations

Ciano to Propose Discussion

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 26th] After Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrives here, he will present for discussion a method of constructing cultural relations between Poland and Italy. An agreement on various cultural collaborations is being drafted by the two governments. Italian and Polish universities will increase the number of professors from each country to exchange various academic knowledge.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 26th] When the Italian Foreign Minister visits Poland, he will discuss how to develop Italian-Polish cultural relations. A draft cultural agreement on scientific, artistic, and literary works will be discussed. Italian universities will add Polish lectures, and the Italian Cultural Institute in Warsaw will be greatly expanded.

### US Naval Exercise, Britain and France to Cooperate, Permission to Borrow Islands

[Associated Press, Washington, 26th] According to reliable sources, Britain and France have agreed to cooperate on the issue of the US fleet exercise. The British government has allowed the US Navy to use British islands near the Caribbean. As for the use of French islands, although negotiations have not been completed, the French side has also expressed in principle that they will allow borrowing "when necessary." The scope of the US naval exercise extends from the Atlantic to the countries of South America. The defense line of the Caribbean Sea is to prevent the enemy from setting up naval bases there. The authorities have not allowed the announcement of who the enemy is, but it is undoubtedly assumed that the enemy is the fascist forces. The offensive base of the hypothetical enemy is far away in Africa. The recent rapid changes in the European situation further prove the need for this US naval exercise.

### 3,000 Italian Overseas Chinese Leave France to Return to Their Country

Goebbels Issues Statement Denying Germany Sent Troops to Africa

[Reuters, Marseille, 25th] Three thousand Italians living in various parts of France left France today to return to their country, because Italian Foreign Minister Ciano promised to find them jobs in the country. It is said that the Italian consul in Ajaccio recently notified the Italians there to prepare to return to their country without delay. One thousand of them will soon return to Italy and transfer to Libya for colonization.

[ 通社, Berlin, 26th] This agency reporter has learned from authoritative German sources that the report in yesterday's "Manchester" guide about German troops going to Libya is purely a rumor. Private sources also cannot prove that German troops have been transferred to Libya or Italian East Africa. In addition, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels said in an interview with the Citizens' Observer that recently foreign newspapers have pointed out that Germany sent officers to Abyssinia to train colonial strategies, etc. This is the most unwise rumor, the purpose of which is to disturb people's minds and create a terrible situation.

### Television Broadcasting, Hundreds of British Theaters to Install Equipment

### Soviet Secret Police Officers Abuse Authority, Four Have Been Tried, Admit to Arresting School Children

[Reuters, Moscow, 26th] It was announced here yesterday that four former secret police officers abused their authority and falsely accused school children of being politically reactionary and arrested them. The four are now on trial in 列寧斯克. Three of them previously served in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and one was the acting judge. They frankly admitted to the detention of school children aged ten to twelve. This is the third case of its kind this year. The previous two cases occurred in 基夫 and Moscow. This is due to the authorities' investigation into the movement to abuse authority, which was initiated by the new Minister of Internal Affairs, 羅倫斯伯里.

### Soviet Radio Operator Dismissed and Tried

[Reuters, Moscow, 26th]  Arctic explorer pilot Levanevsky, who disappeared en route from Moscow to America via the North Pole, radio operator Vonisenesky, is accused of obstructing the search. The trial opened on [date indistinct], with 508 spectators including polar and arctic pilots, staff, and journalists. Vonisenesky's testimony was low. He said, "I could not resist the lonely situation of being alone for long and the adventurous work, and I was already sick." He admitted that he was too tired and stopped the radio, did not receive or send important information about Levanevsky's flight, and transmitted incorrect weather conditions, which delayed the rescue work. When the Moscow authorities suspected his actions, they immediately telegraphed to dismiss him. After receiving the order in secret, he replied, "Levanevsky is dead and his body is missing." The prosecutor stated that Vonisenesky's superior, Grigoriev, was responsible for commanding 27 staff members in the Arctic colony, and failed to strictly supervise Vonisenesky, leading to the delay. He is an enemy of the people, and has also been arrested by the authorities.

### Queen of the Netherlands Visits Switzerland

### Hungary Purges National Socialist Party Members; Party Originated in Germany; Keen Attention Paid to Reactions in German Newspapers

[Reuters, Hungarian Capital, 26th]  It was learned yesterday that 47 leaders of the Hungarian National Socialist Party have been sent to concentration camps, and the authorities have further purged its members, arresting 200 to 300 people in various places. The police confiscated the party's funds and seized other secret documents, proving that the "Black Arsenal Line" that bombed the synagogue on the 4th of this month was a secret organization of the party. Seventy-seven members of the Black Line Party were arrested, and some party members fled to Vienna. The Hungarian National Socialist Party is entirely composed of Hungarians, with no Germans, but there is no doubt that the party originated in Germany. Currently, all parties are closely watching how the German newspapers react to this move by the Hungarian government.

Hungarian Prime Minister's Special Broadcast

### British Government to Formulate Palestine Plan; To be Submitted to Arab and Jewish Sides Today; Jews Demand Participation in Political Power

[Reuters, London, 25th] The British government's plan for Palestine will be submitted to Arab and Jewish representatives on the 27th. The content of the plan has not been officially announced, but it is generally believed to be a preliminary step towards establishing a "Palestinian state" in order to achieve equal rights for the people, protect the Jewish nation, and closely cooperate with the British military. According to rumor, a legislative council will be jointly formed by the British, Arab, and Jewish sides, and the Arab and Jewish sides will be invited to participate in the administrative power of the state. Currently, only the outline of the plan is given to the Arab and Jewish sides, which will be explained by Colonial Secretary MacDonald.

[Reuters, London, 26th] The Jewish delegation did not have a meeting today, but Weizmann and several Jewish leaders met with MacDonald at St. James's Palace yesterday. The Jewish side believes that it is incredible to propose granting Palestine independence without Jewish approval and cooperation. They stated that, whether viewed from a historical background or the current situation, it is sufficient to prove that Jews do need to participate in Palestine's political power.

### Semi-Official Italian Newspaper Attacks Democratic Countries; Claims that Military Expansion is a Danger to Peace; But Tone is Not as Intense as Before

[Reuters, Rome, 25th] A semi-official newspaper here, "International Relations," today criticized the military expansion of democratic countries, but the tone was moderate, not as intense as before. The article stated, "The military expansion of democratic countries is a danger to peace. Politically speaking, since the Munich Agreement, Europe has been like a 'brake car', and today the situation is even worse. Democratic countries attempt to contain totalitarian countries through military and economic means. If England, America, and France want to drag Europe into war, they can continue to proceed with the previous method. Once a European war occurs, it will inevitably split the British Empire and eliminate France's power in Europe."

Brief Commentary

### Strive for the Defection of Puppet Troops

Since the start of the second phase of the War of Resistance, the Japanese invading forces have been unable to continue their advance, and the combat effectiveness of the Japanese army has been declining. Recently, the anti-war rebellions of Japanese army and air force officers and soldiers in various places, and the large-scale defection and brewing of rebellions by puppet troops in various places, are the most important explanations.

According to a report from the Central News Agency in Hequ, 24th, the Suiyuan puppet army's strength is weakening, and the Mongolian puppet troops are brewing a defection. The puppet Prince De and Li Shou-hsin's troops are being reorganized, claiming to be ten divisions, but in reality, there are only a few thousand people. This shows the weakness of the puppet army in North China and its continued brewing of rebellion and defection. Recently, the overall Anti-Japanese War front has been tight, and the Japanese army's forces are becoming increasingly dispersed. The main way to alleviate the crisis of insufficient troops is to organize a large number of puppet troops. Now that there is such instability within the puppet army, it is an important factor increasing the crisis of the Japanese army's collapse.

Regarding expanding political work and actively launching anti-war rebellions by the Japanese army, this newspaper has repeatedly stated its importance. At the same time, with the development of the situation, the work of striving for the defection of puppet troops should still be regarded as one of the major tasks of current political work. However, in this regard, we believe that there are still two points that must be noted: first, the work of striving for defection must have a whole plan, especially targeting the deceptive slogans such as "anti-communism and saving the people" and "national independence" used by the Japanese in organizing puppet troops, the work of striving for puppet troops must be combined with propaganda to strengthen the true meaning of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and unite all ethnic groups in the country to seek liberation. Second, to strive for the defection of puppet troops, we must broadly develop political work in the occupied areas, and at the same time focus on the implementation of democratic politics and the improvement of the people's lives in areas where the government's power reaches, in order to thoroughly smash the Japanese deceptive propaganda of organizing puppet troops and their sinister "appeasement policy."

### The Sino-Japanese War and the Anti-Communist Pact

— Translated by Shi Chang

Original by ASIATICUS, published in the January issue of "Asia-America Magazine"

Although Germany's strength is expanding day by day, the firm policies of England, America, and France can still prevent fascist aggression. The power of China to support the long-term War of Resistance, the main defense of Hong Kong, and the position of Britain in the Far East are not pessimistic. The expansion of the Japanese Navy has been greatly weakened due to the strengthening of the army. Therefore, any improvement in the position of the Japanese Navy cannot prove the increase in Japanese strength. Japan is now deeply mired in the war against China. If war breaks out in Europe, it will definitely not be able to transfer the main force of its army or navy to attack the Soviet Union. This is beyond doubt. Conversely, the Soviet Union's Far Eastern Army and China's continued resistance are enough to threaten the existence of Japanese imperialism, and at the same time, there is no need to request reinforcements from the European part of the Soviet Union.

The weak foundation of the Japanese-Roman-Berlin axis is not mysterious. The conflict with the Soviet Union on the Siberian border last summer (referring to the Zhanggufeng Incident) clearly showed this. Japan launched this incident to encourage the activities of fascist countries in Europe, and at the same time hoped to receive enthusiastic assistance from Berlin and Rome. But the paper tiger was exposed. The Soviet Red Army not only showed verbally, but also in action, its willingness to resolutely fight. The result was a miserable failure for Japan. Japan miscalculated, believing that given the unstable world situation at the time, the Soviet Union would not accept the challenge on the Siberian border. This shameful failure also exposed the effectiveness of the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact: fascist countries can only help each other by threatening other countries, and cannot provide actual and effective assistance. At that time, Japanese reconnaissance planes reported the actions of the Red Army. The Red Army not only worked hard to advance its positions in the Zhanggufeng area, but also implemented advances towards the entire Manchurian border. At this time, Germany and Italy advised Japan to implement "localization of the border incident." The result is very obvious: Japan's "small war" against China has hindered the final plan for a "big war" against the Soviet Union. There is also another result, which should be known to the countries concerned in the Pacific region: Japan's aggression, whether due to orders from Tokyo or initiated by local military authorities, can be stopped by applying resolute and rapid retaliatory actions!

It is not surprising that Germany and Italy, Japan's belligerent friends, are leading diplomatic attacks and instigating "peace" with China. The peace they seek is the kind of peace that Czechoslovakia obtained last year. The result of "mediation" will inevitably produce victims under the Anti-Comintern Pact. The signatories to this pact can be divided into two categories: masters and stewards. The latter are the despicable "Manchukuo" government, General Franco, and any Chinese government that negotiates "peace" with Japan. Japan now desperately needs help to achieve peace, so as to rest from the endless and exhausting "victory." The wider Japan's "conquered" area, the more serious the problems of dealing with the Chinese regular army and guerrillas, and protecting transportation lines. The louder Japan's cries for international assistance and solidarity against the "communist threat!"

The Chinese puppet government under Japanese control has an important responsibility for maintaining the pretext of the "communist threat." Japan can use this puppet organization to call for peace, station troops in the "occupied" areas, and help "punishment units" attack "communists." The puppet government also has an important task: Japan can use it to create economic blockades and pass all laws and regulations that damage the trade and treaty interests of other countries; but Japan has not yet achieved this goal. Japan desperately needs peace to avoid collapse, so it has rejected the joint mediation of Britain and the United States. It is not surprising. England and the United States may be able to establish an international force to prevent Japan's hegemony on the mainland—no matter how small this force is—for this reason, Japan refutes that England and the United States have not recognized a new fact in the Far East, and believes that Germany is a "impartial" country that can persuade the Chinese government to seek peace with Japan to save itself from the scourge of communism.

Fortunately, some people in China have not expressed their willingness to make peace. On the contrary, the Chinese people unanimously and resolutely believe that true peace cannot be obtained until the Japanese aggressors are completely driven out of the country. China's mortal war for freedom is the only effective way to prevent Japan from infringing on the interests of the great powers in the Far East. The failure of Japan to attempt to conquer China is the only guarantee to prevent Japan from threatening other areas in the Far East and the Pacific! (To be continued)

### Preparing for Conscription in Times of Emergency; Hong Kong Government Actively Preparing for National Registration; Exemptions to Registration to be Implemented After Regulations are Set; Funds Allocated to Organize Fire Brigade Volunteers to Cope with Emergency

In order to ascertain the number of technical personnel for the purpose of conscription in times of emergency, the Hong Kong government previously promulgated the National Registration Ordinance. However, the date of implementation of the ordinance has not yet been determined. It is understood that the reason for the delay in determining the date of implementation is that the regulations for exemption from registration are still under consideration. At the same time, other preliminary implementation measures have not been finalized. However, the government is very actively preparing for the national registration, and it is believed that the announcement of the implementation date will not be far off. The National Registration Ordinance promulgated by the Hong Kong government is limited to British residents in Hong Kong, while Chinese and British-Chinese are not restricted. In addition, the Hong Kong Air Defense Authority has paid much attention and effort to the work of coping with emergencies. Recently, it has approved a first-phase budget of $11,000 to organize a fire brigade volunteer team, recruiting 50 members for a training period of four to five months, learning various firefighting techniques, and knowledge of extinguishing incendiary bombs. The recruitment of team members will begin soon and the team will be formally established. The Hong Kong emergency firefighting plan has been planned by the Fire Brigade and Air Defense Authority. All members of the Fire Brigade are now learning air defense knowledge to reduce the danger of air raids in Hong Kong and assist the public.

### Flames of War Everywhere; Hong Kong's Spring Trade This Year is Weak; Export Trade is Half Suspended; Textiles, Piece Goods, and Rice Industry are All Depressed; Most Foreign Sundries Go Unnoticed

For Hong Kong Chinese merchants engaged in the export business, there is a so-called "Spring Trade" after the Lunar New Year every year. This trade is actually the largest part of the entire year's business. As a rule, this batch of orders has already been collected before the seventh day of the first month. In short, the annual business situation of Chinese export merchants in Hong Kong is determined by the amount of the spring trade in that year. This year, the situation of the Spring Trade of Chinese merchants in Hong Kong is a matter of social concern. This reporter spent several days investigating the actual situation of various industries, and now reports as follows:

Textiles: It should be said that the largest part of the Spring Trade of Chinese export merchants in Hong Kong is textiles and piece goods. In recent years, large and small textile factories have sprung up in Hong Kong, numbering in the hundreds. Except for a part of the products sold in Hong Kong, most of the rest are exported to Nanyang, Haiphong, and coastal ports. Some are also exported to the Dutch East Indies and mainland China. This year, Haikou was invaded by the enemy, and the delivery of goods was suspended. At the same time, textile factories in Shanghai have also resumed spinning, competing for business with Hong Kong factories in Haiphong and other places. Therefore, Hong Kong's Spring Trade has been affected to some extent. The factories in Hong Kong sometimes trade with the Philippine Islands, so the business is still very prosperous.

Piece Goods Industry: As for orders for piece goods, they are also affected by products from the occupied areas and enemy products. According to what this reporter knows, shops in Hong Kong, such as [indistinct] and [indistinct], have received many Spring Trade orders from various places, but the piece goods of these shops are completely transported from the enemy side to Hong Kong, impersonating domestic goods and dumping them in various places. The cost of enemy goods is lower, and the goods of Chinese merchants are attacked. Also, because Guangzhou has fallen, the piece goods in Hong Kong have lost one outlet. Those in Guangxi and other places no longer ship goods from Hong Kong. Currently, the piece goods shops in Hong Kong are still seeing customers like clouds, but large orders are rare. The future of sales is difficult to be optimistic about.

Sundries Shops: The Spring Trade goods of sundries shops are also in a state of suspended animation. The trading in Haikou has completely stopped, and Fuzhou and Xiamen have long been ignored. Although there are orders from Shantou and other places, the number is not large. Among the sundries, such as rubber shoes, there is still some improvement. Other items, such as children's toys, leather balls, felt, felt hats, kettles, Western-style clothing supplies, etc., are almost unattended. It is estimated that among all export goods, the sundries industry is the most depressed.

Rice and Grain Industry: As for the export of foreign rice, it is also very weak. Both the source and transportation are in a turbulent autumn. The environment is not constant. In the past, each ship arriving in Hong Kong from Annam would carry at least ten thousand bags, but the three Annam ships that recently arrived in Hong Kong carried only about six thousand bags. And this includes more than two thousand bags of miscellaneous grains. The actual number of white rice carried is only three thousand bags. If this continues in the future, the future of rice supply in Hong Kong can be seen. As for exports, because South China is in a military state, large exports are generally weak. In short, the Spring Trade of Chinese merchants in Hong Kong this year is in a state of semi-suspension. Although there are orders, the number is not large. Unless the situation in various places becomes stable, it will be difficult for Hong Kong's export business to improve.

### Cargo Boat Robbed on Ma Chau Waters; All Twelve People in the Boat Were Driven Ashore; Both Boat and Goods Stolen, Loss Reaches Over a Thousand Dollars

The waters near Hong Kong have always been frequented by pirates. The robbery of passing ships, and even the theft of ships, is often heard. Yesterday morning, the 24th, in the waters of Ma Chau, a Chinese territory close to the British border, another cargo boat was robbed, with a loss of several hundred dollars. It was found that the cargo boat, No. 1233, had been fully loaded with bamboo poles from Dongguan on the 23rd of this month and was coming to Hong Kong. At about 2 a.m. the next day (the 24th), when it reached the waters of Ma Chau, which is opposite Nantou in Baoan County, the sea was dark. The boatman Zhao De (52 years old) knew that the waters there were frequented by pirates, so even though it was dark and he could not tell the direction, he did not dare to stop. In addition to the bamboo poles, the boat also carried seven passengers and five boat companions, a total of twelve people. At that time, the passengers and two boat companions were already asleep. Only the boatman Zhao De and two companions were driving the boat. Suddenly, a small boat was seen speeding from the shore. There were five burly men on the boat, all between the ages of twenty and thirty, wearing black or gray cloth short shirts and pants, and one was holding a pistol. When the pirate boat approached, the men on the boat yelled, demanding that the cargo boat stop. The people in the cargo boat did not dare to disobey and were forced to stop. The pirates then drove the boat alongside the cargo boat, jumped onto the cargo boat, threatened everyone on the boat, and tied them up one by one. Then they drove the prisoners into the cabin. The pirates then searched everyone's belongings and drove the boat to a small island opposite [indistinct] , driving Zhao and the other eleven people ashore. Because the pirates were extremely fierce, Zhao and the others had no choice but to obey. The pirates then sped away with the boat, heading towards the Chinese waters. They had no choice but to walk back to Hong Kong. As they were walking slowly, they happened to meet another familiar cargo boat passing by, so they asked for help to take the individuals back to Hong Kong to report the case. The rest of the people have not yet been able to return to Hong Kong. The cargo boat is worth about six or seven hundred dollars, plus two hundred dollars worth of bamboo poles and clothing, for a total loss of over a thousand dollars.

### First Prize in the Lottery is $250,000; Let's See Who Gets It Today; Derby Race Drawing Announced at 4 PM This Afternoon

The holding of the Spring Derby Race has given a great stimulus to the general leisure class. According to the final cutoff yesterday, the Hong Kong Racecourse's one-dollar Derby lottery has sold up to 550,000 tickets. There is not much time left now. I am afraid that purchasing power will gradually weaken. Even if more tickets are sold, it will only be a little over ten thousand. The Derby Championship Lottery will be held again at 4 o'clock this afternoon, and the special lottery will also be drawn. It is estimated that the first prize can be obtained is 250,000 yuan, the second prize is about 66,000 yuan, and the third prize is about 33,000 yuan. There are a total of 29 qualifying ticket numbers, and each ticket can get about 3,000 yuan. This lively situation reminds people of ten years ago when the South China Athletic Association held the Derby Lottery every year, and the first prize was often around 300,000 yuan. Many changes have occurred in the middle of the situation. After at least seven or eight years, the magnificent number has not been heard. Now, it is gratifying that the grand event can be reproduced, but I don't know which lucky person will get this windfall. I would like to tell the readers here that if any of you are lucky enough to match the horse "Ni Huili" or "Nu Siyi Li", I dare to congratulate this person in advance, because it can be said that this person has almost won half of the first prize. According to everyone's observation, plus the results of last Saturday's race, it seems that there are only two horses in today's competition, namely "Ni Huili" and "Nu Siyi Li." The former ran one mile and two furlongs in the trial race, and the latter ran six furlongs in the maiden race. Dedicating his skills for the first time, he returned singing a triumphant song with a distance of more than one horse, which gave us a very good impression!

### Overseas Chinese Compatriots Enthusiastically Donate, Reaching Over 40 Million in One Year, Hong Kong Alone Over One Million

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese compatriots have enthusiastically contributed, consistently and tirelessly, greatly benefiting the future of the War of Resistance. The amount is by no means small. It is estimated that from July of the year before last to the end of June last year, donations have been successively remitted from overseas. According to the investigation, the amount received yesterday totaled 43,686,128.55 yuan in national currency. Regarding the regions of the donating overseas Chinese, Europe includes England, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Portugal, Czech Republic, Turkey, Russia, Switzerland, and Sweden. The Americas include various states of the United States, Canada, Cuba, Panama, Mexico, Chile, and Peru. Asia includes India, Annam, Burma, Siam, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, British Malaya, Dutch East Indies, American Philippines, Honolulu, as well as ports in Africa and Oceania. Regarding the types of donations from overseas Chinese, in addition to using local currency, they also contributed gold, silver, rice, grain, or negotiable securities with sincere dedication to protect their motherland. Recently, the President of the Executive Yuan, Kong, announced the number of disaster relief and charity donations from overseas Chinese from July of the 26th year of the Republic of China to June of the 27th year. The total amount for each continent is as follows:

### Chinese Clerical Staff Association Held a Frugal Donation Ceremony Last Night, Achieving Remarkable Results

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, three amateur professional groups have emerged in Hong Kong with a new look. The Amateur Friendship Association includes professional members from all walks of life; the members of the Literary and Clerical Staff Association are mostly employees of foreign firms; and the Banking Amateur Friendship Association is purely for employees in the banking sector. Promoting proper entertainment and serving society and the country are their common goals.

Although there is a division into three groups on the surface due to the natural tendency of language and occupational background, in fact, they are three in one, sister groups with different paths but the same goal. The cadres of the three groups have close ties in spirit and take care of each other in their work, actively seeking common development.

This fact illustrates that as the motherland struggles on the line of life and death, the alert compatriots of Hong Kong are also moving away from the "licentiousness and shamelessness" and towards the "serious work" path.

This time, promoting a new way to celebrate the Lunar New Year, all three groups have made the greatest effort. What the reporter wants to report here is the news from the Chinese Clerical Staff Association:

Before the "New Year," the association distributed a large number of red envelopes with "Frugal Donation Envelopes" printed on them to its members, ten per person. The front cover was written with a mobilization slogan (Save on Unconscious Waste, Strengthen the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction). In addition to donating freely themselves, the association's more than 180 members should also distribute other donation envelopes to relatives and friends to donate as much as they can. It goes without saying that this influence is quite extensive.

At 7:30 last night, the association held a donation ceremony at its clubhouse. After the ceremony, Li Hanping gave an opening speech, followed by guest speeches, and Chen Shuangyu gave a reply speech. Next was the most exciting program. Enthusiastic members enthusiastically presented donation envelopes. Encouraged by the shouting, everyone was busy opening, counting, and registering the donation envelopes. The results were quite impressive. Finally, entertainment performances were held to celebrate, and everyone dispersed happily. The association's donation results last night were as follows: HK$313.59, national currency $40.50, fractional currency $9.40, Guangdong fractional currency $0.081. The largest individual donation that night was: staff of the shipping department of Jebsen & Co., a total of HK$90, and Mr. Han Jincheng alone donated HK$10. It is heard that a small part of the donation envelopes has not yet been handed in, and the total amount will be calculated tomorrow.

### Chinese Night School Teachers' Association held a Reunion Meeting at Kong Saint Hall Yesterday Afternoon

Special Dispatch from This Newspaper: The Hong Kong Vocational Night College is an educational institution under the management of the Hong Kong Education Bureau. The Chinese Teacher Training Department is an academic group for local primary and secondary school Chinese teachers to study. This organization has a history of over twenty years. Because it rarely interacts with the outside world, the public's perception of it is so vague. They themselves feel that there is considerable strength in this group and that it should be organized as much as possible to contribute to society, hence the organization of the Night School Alumni Association. In addition to the goals of general alumni associations, this organization also has a determination to serve social education. - This association has been established for more than ten months.

Yesterday (26th) at noon, they held their third reunion at the Kong Saint Hall in Caroline Hill. The meaning was to connect the feelings between classmates and students on the one hand; on the other hand, it was to sincerely hope to get guidance from outsiders. It was held grandly with the cooperation of classmates and teachers. More than 500 people attended, including the director of the school, Luo Renbo, as well as teachers, classmates, and guests.

The venue was decorated simply and solemnly. The Chinese and British flags were hung at the front door, and a dark blue curtain was hung on the stage, with the party's flag and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen in the center. The ceremony began at one o'clock. Although filled with the joy of a reunion, they remotely expressed solemn and silent sympathy for the soldiers fighting in front and the compatriots in distress. The director of the school, Wei Renbo, personally gave instructions and described in detail the special educational environment of Hong Kong and the knowledge that educators in Hong Kong should have. Teacher Huang Guofang of the school also gave sincere encouragement to the association.

In order to not forget the War of Resistance during the reunion, a flower sale was held to respond to the One Dollar to Repay Debt movement. An immediate calculation showed a total of $21.40, which was decided to be handed over to this newspaper for transfer to the government.

The entertainment program included the drama "On the Front Line" performed by the Heming Drama Society, "The Roar of the Fugitive" and "Seeking Survival from Death" by the Whirlwind Drama Society; the chorus by the Life Choir, the solo of the South China Sea Situation by Huang Haizhi, the xylophone solo by Zhao Enrong and his son, and the dwarf song and dance. The entire audience had considerable tension. The song South China Sea Situation is the theme song of the film South China Sea Situation being directed by the famous director Cai Chusheng, expressing the charm and enthusiasm of the fishermen as much as possible. The performances of the dramas were all quite successful, especially the play "Seeking Survival from Death," which was most able to grasp the audience's psychology and attention.

### Unprecedented Feat: Entire Hong Kong Drama Circle Mobilized, Patriotic Performance of "Huanghuagang" on National Holiday, Director Team and Staff of All Departments Elected Yesterday, Immediate Start of Active Work, Performance on March 29th

The China Art Drama Troupe, the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, and the Guangdong Drama Association Compatriots in Hong Kong and other three major drama troupes, launched a joint performance of Huanghuagang by all Hong Kong drama groups on the great commemorative day of our nation - Huanghua Festival - to help refugees in Shenzhen and Jintian.

### Charity Sale and Amusement Fair

From morning, the sun did not show its face, and spring rain sprinkled sparsely. In this kind of distressing weather, people seemed to have nothing to do but doze off. At this time, perhaps the directors of the Charity Sale and Amusement Fair organized by the Hong Kong British Disaster Relief Association Fundraising Committee were deeply praying to heaven, asking the merciful master of all things to save a little rain and give more sunshine, otherwise, the charity sale and amusement fair that opened yesterday afternoon would probably be in trouble. Sure enough, perhaps the refugees still had some blessings, and in the afternoon, although there was still no sunshine, the drizzle suddenly stopped!

The main entrance of King's College had long been decorated as brightly as a brocade. It is said that the cost of decorating this grand facade was borne by the Hop Hing Peanut Oil Factory! The cost of other decorations inside the venue was also borne separately by enthusiastic people. All proceeds from the amusement and sale are donated to help refugees who are displaced, hungry, and cold. Before three o'clock, male and female guests had arrived in droves, making it very lively. The male and female staff who entertained the guests were all very busy.

At 3:00 pm, the opening ceremony of the sale and amusement fair was held. The hall of King's College was really crowded with people, packed like sardines. First, Chairman Lei Yincong gave an opening speech, followed by Lu Yun reporting on the preparations, Ye Lan thanking the businesses for donating goods; finally, Luo Xuxue and Sir delivered speeches. People standing further away were probably not able to know what the people on the stage were saying, but even if they couldn't hear it, they would probably guess eight or nine tenths of it. What they said was nothing more than those words that encouraged our audience to do more good deeds.

When it came time to cut the ribbon to open the amusement and sale, Sir Luo Xuxue was about to cut the ribbon, but unexpectedly, the person in charge was negligent and forgot that scissors were needed to cut the ribbon, which made Sir Luo wait for more than ten minutes before finding the scissors. After the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the guests poured down from the upstairs, and the amusement area and the sale area immediately became active.

The venue was arranged with the sale area on the right and the amusement area on the left, and the tea room further in. Upstairs in the sale area was the singing area. The sale area displayed various factory products, in various styles, beautiful and dazzling, which really made the viewers reluctant to let go, and the prices were low, all sold at market prices, so shopping was very enthusiastic.

The amusement programs were all meaningful and fun, such as "Beating Traitors" which made people laugh. Other games such as fishing, spinning wheel prizes, shooting, etc., were also thought-provoking. In addition, there were also Feiqiu, throwing airplanes, flying needles, hitting pool, adding number awards, trying strength awards, flying ring copper buckles, shooting raw fruits, flying immortals into plates, five-color ball throwing, cycling competitions, green butterflies into place, hitting big dice, rubber gun balloons, final victory, aviation salvation, throwing sand tube rubber bead human caves, etc., a total of twenty west items. Each item was listed on an amusement table, all of which were amusement in nature. At the cost of one hao, you could get items whose value was several times the price.

The first to patronize the amusement park was Lawyer Luo Wenxin. He "hit the traitor" many times, and finally hit the "female traitor" and won a prize; however, Lawyer Luo did not care about what prizes he won, it seemed that he was just doing his best. I think, if there were more enthusiastic people who did not care, the harvest of the amusement part would be better. Remotely opposite the "Hitting Traitors" section was "XXX", and the number of people patronizing these two sections was more than other sections, which shows how enthusiastic the people were, and how they wanted to eat the flesh and sleep on the skin of the traitors. According to one "Hitting Traitor" player, beating the traitor this time was much more enjoyable than beating Qin Hui and his wife at Yue Wang's tomb in West Lake a few years ago. Now, the spring outing ladies of West Lake are probably gone, which is cheaper for Qin Hui, the ancestor of the traitor. The slogans in the venue were also very eye-catching and powerful, such as "Those who grow wealth should be able to provide relief, otherwise it is just wealth," "Foreigners are still helping our compatriots in distress, what should our people do?" I believe that many people will be unhappy or ashamed after seeing such slogans!

The fair will last for two more days, and I would like to plead on behalf of the countless compatriots in distress here. Overseas Chinese, please be kind and generous, and come to the occasion that combines entertainment and relief to give these compatriots in distress as much help as you can! Come on! This charity sale and amusement fair will satisfy you. (New)

###  Japanese Troops Anxiously Attempt to Occupy the Entire Island, Japanese Warships Gather Off the Coast of Southern Guangdong, Approximately Seventy Japanese Warships Assembled Near the Qiongzhou Strait, Our Garrison Soldiers Vow Not to Retreat an Inch of Land Easily

[Fast News from the South Road] It has been more than ten days since the Japanese army launched a military operation to invade Hainan Island. After our soldiers and civilians fought bravely separately, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. This severely hampered the Japanese ambition to occupy the entire island as expected, forcing them to exhaust all resources and transfer troops from Taiwan, Xiamen, Tuandao Island, and other places to provide reinforcements. Therefore, in recent days, Japanese warships have been frequently traveling to and from the coast of southern Guangdong, and the transportation of military supplies has been particularly busy. According to information received by a certain agency yesterday, there are approximately forty Japanese warships assembled off the coast of southern Guangdong, most of which are concentrated in the Qiongzhou Strait. In addition, there are more than ten ships in Dongchang, Jianjiao, and Hai'an ports belonging to Xuwen County. Near Haikou, Qiongzhou, there are two giant engineering ships, five battleships, three submarines, eight transport ships converted from merchant ships, and seven or eight gunboats. In addition, they patrol the coastal ports to spy. The military equipment, food, and supplies that have been transported in recent days are all unloaded at Haikou and forced our fishing boats to transport them to Qiongshan, Chengmai, and Ding'an to provide for the Japanese troops in those areas for continued invasion.

It is also reported that our brave soldiers guarding Qiongya have made a great determination to defend Qiongya. They will never easily retreat even an inch of land. Therefore, under the command of Commander Wang Yi and Commander Yang Yongren, they have been fighting bravely. Many Japanese soldiers have been killed in the Jiaji and Lingshui areas. In addition, the Japanese army rapes, loots, and kills everywhere, and the people are filled with hatred for the Japanese atrocities. They vow to avenge their hometown and have joined the guerrillas to participate in the War of Resistance. Their strength is increasing day by day. The difficulties the Japanese will encounter in the future will be even greater. The Japanese dream of penetrating deep into the interior and occupying the entire Qiong in a short period of time will be difficult to realize.

### The Situation in Dongjiang is Tight Again, The Japanese are Building Fortifications as if Preparing for a Major War, and Shameless Traitors are Rampant

[Fast News from Shenzhen] After the Japanese troops in the Dongjiang Shilong, Shitan, Taiping, and Wancheng strongholds were reinforced, in the past week, the Japanese troops on the Wan Tai, Wan Long, and Guanghu highways have been busy transporting food and military supplies. The Japanese troops in each stronghold have expanded the outer defense line and built fortifications, as if preparing for the arrival of a major war. Therefore, the situation in Dongjiang is gradually becoming tense, and at the same time, traitors are unusually rampant.

### Japanese Fear Our Guerrillas, Burn Zhangmutou

[Fast News from Dongguan] On the 19th of this month, more than 3,000 Japanese troops opened Zengcheng from Guangzhou, and the Japanese troops in Zengcheng immediately advanced to the Shilong and Shitan area. On the 21st and 22nd, more than 400 Japanese infantrymen, with 12 small steel cannons, advanced south along the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway from Shilong. On the 23rd, they arrived near Zhangmutou Station and immediately occupied various key points, claiming to check the household registration of each village and ordering the gentry to hand over the guerrillas. Zhangmutou is only composed of two villages inhabited by Yuan and Luo clans, in addition to the highway station and small market. The Japanese feared that our Huizhou teams would advance and lurk here, threatening the middle section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 23rd, they sent half of the Japanese troops to advance east along the Huizhang Highway to deploy defenses near Shima to prevent our Huizhou teams from attacking. The rest set fire in separate groups in Zhangmutou Station and the Yuan and Luo villages, prohibiting rescue. At one time, the fire was raging, spreading in separate groups, and the residents fled in succession, their cries shaking the sky. The situation was terrible. The fire continued to burn until the 24th and had not been extinguished. The houses and huts in the station area of the station highway and the Yuan and Luo villages were all burned to the ground, and many residents died of cold and starvation on the road. On the afternoon of the 24th, the Japanese troops in Shima began to withdraw and returned to deploy defenses near Zhangmutou Station to prevent our Huizhou troops from tracking them down.

### The Guangdong Provincial Government Cares About the People, Orders Shipping Companies to Stop Collecting War of Resistance Fees

[Fast News from Shaoguan] Since the War of Resistance, local authorities in Guangdong Province have levied various War of Resistance fees and security fees in order to maintain the team's salaries and supplies. Since Li Hanhun took office as the chairman of Guangdong Province, he has made it his responsibility to relieve the people's suffering and rectify official corruption. He has received many complaints from merchants and people about the collection of War of Resistance fees in various counties, requesting that strict prohibition be implemented to comply with government instructions and the decree that local officials are not allowed to levy any donations. Chairman Li has also sent personnel to various counties to investigate, and it has been confirmed that the collection is true. He has ordered the commanders of the guerrilla zones and the magistrates of the counties to immediately abolish the War of Resistance fees to reduce the burden on the people and benefit the traveling passengers and goods. It has recently been found that the counties that control the transportation channels have abolished the War of Resistance fees, but the fees were originally collected from the passengers and goods' fares by various ferries. However, since the abolition, the ferries have not deducted the fees and are still charging as usual. Chairman Li has heard about this matter and yesterday ordered the commanders of the guerrilla zones and the magistrates of the counties to instruct the shipping companies to immediately reduce and exempt the War of Resistance fees in the passenger fares, and not to collect any fees on behalf of local officials. If anyone still collects War of Resistance fees from passengers and secretly sends them to local officials, they will be severely punished.

### Fierce Blood Battles Continue Between Jiaji and Ding'an, The Japanese Suffered Heavy Casualties from Our Annihilation

[Fast News from Jiaji] Since the Japanese launched the landing at Haikou on the 10th of this month, they have divided their troops to occupy Qiongshan and advanced into the inland areas of Chengmai and Ding'an. Another warship was sent to cover the Japanese troops to land and invade the counties of Yaxian, Lingshui, and Qiongdong from Zhaohai. However, the Japanese troops landing in various places have been met with strong resistance, and there has been no progress so far. The Japanese troops who invaded Jiaji, Lingshui, and Chengmai have also been repeatedly annihilated by our army, suffering heavy casualties, and have been unable to make contact with other landing Japanese troops. However, the Japanese army's conspiracy to wipe out our team has not been reduced in the slightest. In recent times, they have been desperately advancing, so fierce blood battles have been fought between Jiaji, Ding'an, and Wenchang in recent days.

### Qiongshan and Wenchang Counties Suffered Heavy Losses, Japanese Brutally Violated Women, Massacred Young People, and Bombed Schools

[Communication from Guangzhou Bay] According to fishermen who escaped from Wenchang County, the order was chaotic when the Japanese captured Haikou, and the military discipline was corrupted. The local women suffered miserably. Hundreds of women who were robbed were imprisoned in one place in Haikou's Five-Story Building and were all brutally violated. Also, when Qiongshan County fell, more than 150 young people in Qiongshan were unable to escape and were all massacred. Before Wenchang County fell, the county middle school was completely bombed by the Japanese planes. The principal, Zhan Hangrui, was injured in the foot by the bombing. The school is located in an open space in the suburbs and occupies a large area. The Japanese's purpose is clearly to destroy our cultural institutions, which is extremely cruel.

### Annihilation Battle in the Dongjiang Luofu Area

— Special Correspondent Bai Wei

Since the withdrawal of the × army from Huibo on October 9th of last year, the military situation in Dongjiang has experienced a relatively long period of silence. In fact, this is due to the × people deeply feeling that their forces are insufficient and having to tighten their defense lines. At the same time, it is also due to the magnificent posture of our counter-offensive and the threat of the people's guerrilla forces. It can control Chaozhou and Meizhou in the upper reaches, defend Guangzhou in the lower reaches, and connect the coast of Daya Bay on the side. In terms of geographical situation, Huizhou—including Huibo, Hezi, Hailu, and other counties—still retains its considerable military value. Therefore, this retreat of the × people was not voluntary, but due to insufficient strength.

Because of this, the × people naturally did not give up their attempt to occupy the area. However, in order to save troops, they changed their form. The Lufeng riot led by the × people at the end of last month was a change of military strategy, adopting political means instead. By February of this year, they felt that the people of Dongjiang were highly agitated and the political conspiracy had completely failed. They then changed their military strategy back to military harassment. The battle of Lianhe Market in the early days and the current battles of Longhua and Changning are examples. In fact, this kind of military harassment by the × people is not only fruitless, but also allows us to complete our attrition and attraction strategy. In particular, it provides our armed peasants with more opportunities to show their skills.

Regarding the battles of Lianhe, Longhua, and Weining, the reporter happened to meet Mr. Xiao Jianxiong, the secretary representing the Boluo County Government, who came to Huizhou to report this afternoon. Combined with information from the Dongjiang Detachment Headquarters, the details of the process are quite clear.

The motives of the × people's repeated harassment all contain the effect of a smokescreen. First, to disrupt our sight and contain the military strength of our Dongjiang forces. Second, to attack as a defense and prevent our offensive. Therefore, when the Lianhe Market was attacked, one or two × ships appeared in Daya Bay, and one or two × aircraft appeared in the sky above Dongjiang. They did not land or drop bombs, proving that it was a coordinated overall plan. As for the intrusion of Longhua and Changning this time, most of it seems to be to cover and coordinate the attack on Hainan Island. The second reason is a means of retaliation for the loss at Lianhe. According to Secretary Xiao's report, in the Battle of Lianhe, six of our people were killed or wounded, but the enemy was killed 52 people, (43 stationed in Shiwang, 5 in Shilong, and 4 in Zengcheng). In the hearts of the × people, what a huge difference.

In view of the lesson of Lianhe, the team that the × people attacked this time amounted to more than 3,000 people. They advanced in two routes. On the afternoon of the 8th, one route of infantry and artillery, more than 1,000 strong, and 300 cavalry came from Shilong via the Jinglan and Masi trails, with the destination being the Longhua area. Another route consisted of infantry, artillery, and cavalry, totaling more than 2,000, with multiple aircraft, coming from Zengcheng, with the destination being the foot of Mount Luofu.

At dawn on the 9th, the × people from Shilong had crossed Baijiao Township and arrived at Longhua. The detachment stationed in Longhua, led by Bu Zhiyang, rose up to resist together with the armed villagers. Although the × aircraft covering the advance continued to bomb, and the × people's mountain artillery continued to bombard, they did not retreat. Relying on the shelter of the houses in the market, they fired at the × people. It was not until the houses on the outer perimeter of the market were almost destroyed that they retreated into the nearby hills. After retreating into the hills, they still hid in the forests, using their Mauser rifles and local rifles to continue to counterattack the × people. This heroic posture is rarely seen. Therefore, the × people entered Longhua and set fire to vent their anger, not daring to stay for long. At 1:00 p.m., they returned to Zhufan, and on the 10th, they returned to Shilong. Along the way, in the villages and townships they passed, Shangcun, Hexu, and Xiacun, the × people burned and killed as they went. Our armed peasants also attacked whenever they encountered them. Due to the peasants' fearless efforts, although our sacrifices were quite large, with nearly 100 casualties, it is expected that the number of × people intercepted by us was not far off. A local rifle, a broadsword, defeated the × people's planes and artillery. The brave peasants and detachment members are eternally worthy of praise. Unexpectedly, this small town actually extinguished the fierce flames of the × people.

The × people from Zengcheng also launched a large-scale attack at the same time, passing through the Fu, Tian, Changning, and Dongping markets in the Fourth District of Boluo, and scurrying to Mount Luofu. The detachment Lin Junsheng's department had already made a frontal resistance, and a fierce bayonet fight broke out. In the end, feeling the disparity in numbers, they led the team to retreat into the Luofu Mountains and the Lan River to carry out guerrilla side attacks. When the × people were advancing along the Luofu Mountain Highway, we were on the mountain of Baiheguan, (rows of light machine gun bullets, swept down like a string of beads, it can already be known how many × people were stained with blood on that road, and when the × people's large team chased after them, we climbed over another mountain, and swept down in the same way, and saw the × people falling one by one, Luofu Mountain can truly be said to be the grave of the × people. Unfortunately, the × people tried desperately to cover up and transport back the bodies of those killed, otherwise, not only would the highway be stained with blood, but there would also be ready-made souvenirs. Team leader Lin Junsheng just arrived in Huizhou to report yesterday. From the tone of his report, the reporter was able to understand how happy and excited he was in this battle. Due to the strange losses, the × people extended their team to Lanshi, and did not dare to miss or prolong the time any longer, and immediately fled back to Zengcheng on the afternoon of the 10th.

If the × people want to calculate what they gained from this operation, I am afraid there is only one thing—burning our villages. Burning is the × people's specialty. From Masi to Longhua, from Futian to Lanshi, although there has been no detailed investigation, it is estimated that about 2,000 houses were burned in total. However, he set fire to the homes of farmers, how is it different from setting fire in the hearts of the farmers, watching our brave and strong farmers, calculate the fire account for their homes and the × people. At the same time, we must widely launch a consolation and relief movement to help these homeless and helpless comrades.

Now the conspiracy of the × people has obviously failed. The team of the × people has retreated to Zengcheng and Shilong, and our team, including the armed masses, is following them to Zengcheng, closely entangled, and launching multifaceted attacks. The Dongjiang Guerrilla team fully implements the basic guerrilla tactics of "I resist when the × people come, and I harass when the × people retreat," so that the × people have no possibility of breathing or taking the initiative. This will make the × people in Dongjiang suffer, weaken, and perish.

### From Shantou to Saigon (Continued)

— Hua You

When I took the jade ring, I felt a little happy. I was about to step back when the tiger-bully said to Mr. Zhang, "I'm a little unhappy with him." As he spoke, he glared at me. When Mr. Zhang asked him why, he said that I shouldn't make a big deal out of it. There are "Mazin" from Chaozhou, Fujian, Hainan, and Hakka here. If I didn't want to give it to him, I could have just stated it. Why did I have to report it to the consulate? I said to Mr. Zhang, if I hadn't done this, I wouldn't have been able to get the meat out of the tiger's mouth.

After returning to the hotel, the Yong'an boss and other guests were all very happy. They said that my victory in this negotiation was the first time ever. Generally, when overseas Chinese come here, they take away a lot of things from them. No one has ever negotiated with them.

It is said that in the past, Saigon customs officials did not take things as much as they do now. The reason why the French are so unscrupulous is as follows:

A Mazin Neglect of Duty—The "Mazin" used in the Qifu Clothing Box Pavilion cannot fulfill their duties. They turn a deaf ear to any difficulties of the overseas Chinese. Not only do they not help you, but sometimes they collude with those customs officers to exploit the overseas Chinese. Recently, the Consulate in Saigon plans to send personnel to the Clothing Box Pavilion to help the overseas Chinese. I don't know if it has been implemented. I think that if the consulate can implement the above plan, the benefits to the overseas Chinese cannot be counted in numbers. If the consulate can send personnel to supervise, those customs officers will naturally not dare to take things from our overseas Chinese arbitrarily. Any difficulties can also be negotiated with him face to face. In fact, at that time, I believe there will be nothing to negotiate, because since we have officials there to supervise, I believe they will be quite polite, because the friendly relations between China and France are very friendly at present.

B Lack of Group Organization—The biggest defect of overseas Chinese in general is that they are too selfish. When they go to Nanyang, they only seek to make money. As long as there is money to be made, they can endure any anger. People catch your weaknesses and naturally do whatever they want. According to the estimation of overseas Chinese, every time a ship docks in Saigon, the losses suffered by overseas Chinese are always in the thousands. This is a huge amount of money accumulated over the years. My meaning is that the persons in charge of Qifu should find a way to make up for this leak. The easiest way is to hire a few more full-time legal advisors. If those customs officers arbitrarily rob the things of the overseas Chinese, they should refute them with reason. Our overseas Chinese luggage, they should handle it according to the regulations. There is absolutely no reason to forcibly seize people's things and take them for themselves.

C Afraid of Trouble—After the author recovered the jade ring, Deputy Consul Zhuo protested to the local tax office. According to the opinion of the tax office, as long as evidence can be collected, they will definitely strictly investigate and deal with it. Therefore, Deputy Consul Zhuo entrusted me to collect some evidence on their behalf, but it took a lot of effort to submit the evidence. They all hid "deeply" for fear that if they came forward, if they needed to testify in court in the future, they were afraid that there would be some problems with their residence. In short, the educational level of overseas Chinese in general is too pitiful. They are mostly unable to distinguish right from wrong for all events. Even if they understand right and wrong, they lack the strength to do anything. So, they can only listen to others and let them slaughter them.

The weaknesses of overseas Chinese in general and the losses suffered have been described above. It is not impossible to remedy these losses. In my humble opinion, as long as the staff of the Consulate in Saigon make use of the current friendly relations between China and France, and further, according to the principle of equality and mutual benefit in the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty signed in Nanjing the year before last (?), request the French colonial government to improve the treatment, I believe it can be done.

A Regarding the opinion that luggage cannot be carried with you when going ashore, the most painful thing that overseas Chinese feel when going to Saigon is that they have no quilts and no clothes to change. Although Annam is located in the tropics, when it encounters the rainy season...the sixth, seventh, and eighth months of the lunar calendar are the months with the most rainfall in Annam, and the climate is cool enough. When night falls, you have to cover yourself with a blanket. We are not allowed to bring even a blanket with us when we go ashore. In this way, when we arrive at the inn, we have to let the cold air bully us (the nature of inns and hotels are different. Hotels have bedding, while inns have nothing except a bed and a wooden pillow). It is a torture not to have a quilt, and it is also a torture not to have clothes to change, not to mention that since disembarking from Shantou, I have not taken a bath—the Pacific third ship, except for the official cabin equipment with bathrooms, there are no bathrooms in the large cabin. In this way, you can only endure until you get ashore, but it is even more painful not to have clothes to change after you get ashore. This is what almost every overseas Chinese thinks is the most painful thing. Therefore, when the ship enters Saigon Port, everyone wears one or two more clothes, (some even wear six or seven pieces. These are generally unconscious women who want to avoid paying taxes, but in the end, they are embarrassed on the spot—they are seen by the customs inspectors). In order to prepare to change clothes when going ashore, the French customs officers think they are trying to evade taxes. I have personally seen a few overseas Chinese wearing two casual shirts (one gauze shirt to pay taxes, and even if they only wear a new gauze shirt, they will be stripped off to pay taxes [To be continued]

### Yesterday's Football Charity Match: Hong Kong Combined Team Forced a Draw with South China, 1-1, the Whole Performance Was Understated

[Special Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday's charity football match at Jia Shan was an understated performance throughout. While sometimes exciting, it also felt ordinary; while sometimes relaxed, it occasionally had moments of tension. In short, this meeting between the two teams was for the sake of disaster victims, with no championship issues at stake. Therefore, the performance aspect outweighed the competitive spirit. Everyone's actions were based on skill, and the match was still pleasing and watchable. The general public also felt their trip was worthwhile, and they donated generously, feeling at peace.

In the morning, there was light drizzle and the weather was dull. The weather cleared up in the afternoon, ensuring the match wasn't affected. Both teams arrived on time, and there were three to four thousand spectators, making the scene quite lively. However, this time, the number of spectators was slightly less than the previous charity matches Li Huitang participated in this year. The reasons for this seem to be due to the following three factors: (1) There have been too many matches recently, and the fans are tired of watching; this is inevitable. (2) From the inter-port trials to the official matches, Huitang has appeared several times, connecting with the fans. Unlike before, when he only appeared after much anticipation, the general longing has turned into a sense of normalcy due to his frequent appearances. (3) The rain yesterday morning suppressed the fans' enthusiasm.

Neither side fielded their originally selected lineup for this match. For South China, Tan Zhenhui replaced Liu Weipei, and Luo Dou replaced Liu Songsheng. However, the overall strength was not diminished at all. For the Hong Kong Combined Team, Gao Shannu was nowhere to be seen. The spectators assumed he wouldn't appear, and had a pessimistic view of the Hong Kong Combined Team's forward line. Mo Shi replaced him as center forward. Shu Shi was also absent, so reserve Li Dishi played left forward, and the unnamed Tan Mashi, who was temporarily invited to play, played left wing. Therefore, at the start of the match, everyone thought South China would win by a large margin. Just comparing the forward lines of the two teams, South China's five tigers were so formidable that even if the Hong Kong Combined Team's defenders weren't scared away, they would be beaten away and unable to withstand their threat. However, despite what people thought, the result after seventy minutes of competition was a 1-1 draw. Moreover, South China's goal was clearly scored when Huitang was offside, but because the referee didn't see it clearly, Huitang was given an unexpected goal. Therefore, although the score was a draw, South China was actually defeated.

This match was for performance purposes, so there's no need to overemphasize the win-loss issue. In terms of strength, South China was indeed stronger and often had the advantage, but in the end, they couldn't find a way to win. They only scored an accidental and offside goal. Was this because South China's forward line was weak, or because the Hong Kong Combined Team's defense was strong? In my opinion, the biggest reason was that Huitang was closely marked by Biludu, who didn't allow him to move freely. Biludu was originally a very good center forward who liked to dribble and attack, but yesterday he changed his style and adopted the third inner defender method, sticking to Huitang like glue. Sometimes, Hou Rongsheng or Shi Han also helped, combining the strength of several people to block Huitang. Therefore, Huitang's central attacks couldn't be unleashed in this match. Throughout the game, he only had two chances to shoot in the first half. Also, because it was a charity match, he wasn't fixated on winning and didn't change his strategy. (In the previous match between the Chinese Combined Team and the Philippine team, he used a retreating strategy, luring the opponent's center back out, and then attacking from the flanks, which achieved remarkable results.) This showed his casual approach. Sun Lai, Mai Shaohan, and Tan Mashi were injured in collisions and had to leave the field. He then retreated from the forward line to the back line to fill the gap left by Shaohan, changing from attack to defense. The general public saw this and talked about it. As far as I know, many years ago, the Shanghai Lehua team toured Hong Kong and put on exhibition matches. At that time, Huitang was still in the Lehua team and played inner defender, performing very well. However, he had never played that position again after returning to Hong Kong. Yesterday, he occasionally played that role, which felt a bit awkward. However, his ability to adapt and retreat showed that he was not someone who had been in the army for nothing.

Some people said that this match was the least exciting charity match ever. However, the outstanding performance of the two goalkeepers is worth praising. Zhang Rongcai's skills are indeed extraordinary. He pounced and jumped at crucial moments to save the ball from danger. His agility and stability in avoiding collisions and saving balls are far superior to ordinary goalkeepers who blindly kick the ball out. This is a great help to the offensive side. Heli still made twisting and diving saves, so Zhao Rong's several quick shots were ineffective. He is also tall and has long arms, and is not afraid of charges. As for the one goal he conceded, he certainly felt it shouldn't have happened.

The Hong Kong Combined Team's forward line performed well. Mo Shi, the center forward, was fierce and had powerful shots, threatening South China quite a bit. The two wings also had good moments. On the defense, because Biludu was focused on marking Huitang and didn't dare to attack, they were able to consolidate their defense and ultimately remain undefeated. I believe that Biludu deserves the most credit for the Hong Kong Combined Team's ability to avoid conceding more goals.

Because the South China players focused on skillful performances, their passing and dribbling were precise. However, because there was too much passing and dribbling, they often competed in midfield, resulting in a situation of mutual contention.

After discussing the football, let's talk about the match situation. The lineups of the two teams during the match were as follows:

[South China Club]

Zhang Rongcai

Li Tiansheng Mai Shaohan

Tan Zhenhui Liang Rongzhao Liu Qingcai

Luo Douwen Li Zhaorong Li Huitang Feng Jingxiang Deng Guangsen

[Hong Kong Combined Team]

Heli

Shi Han Hou Rongsheng

Xu Cheng Biludu Ni Bolu

Tan Mashi Li Dishi Mo Shi Ni Anbachen

When the time came, the god of war arrived, and the two armies began to fight fiercely. Huitang took the lead, with Zhaorong and Jingxiang dividing their forces to assist the attack. The Hong Kong Combined Team's midfielders saw this and met them with a three-pronged attack. After a few rounds, Huitang and others led their troops back. Anbachen stole through the defense and cut the ball in. Dishi fired in the middle, and Rongcai stepped forward to save it, very well done.

Douwen and Zhaorong joined forces, but were blocked by Hanni Bolu and couldn't advance further. On the other side, Tan Mashi launched a rebellion at the border gate, cutting in perfectly. Mo Shi rushed forward to shoot, but Rongcai dived to save it, another great play. Although the Hong Kong Combined Team got a corner kick, they retreated without any advantage. Rongzhao, Zhenhui, and Caicai, three heroes, covered the forward army and pushed forward. Indeed, Huitang broke through the barrier and entered. Douwen responded and forced a corner kick. The bottom line came open, and Zhaorong shot fiercely, but Heli saved it well, turning danger into safety.

Dishi stole into the encirclement and fired a cold arrow. Mo Shi fired in succession, with a strong momentum. Fortunately, Rongcai had quick eyes and hands, and was not caught off guard. Then, Lishi attacked again, but Tiansheng calmly saved it. Dou Tian then waved his troops forward, crossing into Rongsheng's position and shooting fiercely. He hit Heli's body, failing to achieve his goal, which was a great pity. However, South China did not lose heart because of this. Rongzhao escorted, and Huitang rushed forward to seek victory. The cannonball was fired, but unfortunately landed outside the field. Zhaorong returned and the Hong Kong Combined Team's defenders saw his menacing momentum and prepared in earnest. Zhaorong rushed into the encirclement and shot at the goal, hitting the goalpost and bouncing out. Guangsen spurred his horse to catch up and added a foot, but again missed, losing a good opportunity.

The Hong Kong Combined Team's crisis had passed, and Anbachen was determined to counterattack, but his shot was inaccurate and ineffective. Jingxiang advanced on the right, and Douwen responded from the side. He got the ball and shot fiercely, but was rejected by Heli out of bounds. Guangsen opened the corner kick, but still didn't gain any advantage. Then Huitang, Douwen, Jingxiang, and Zhaorong's coalition forces rushed in, like an overwhelming force. Heli stood forward and tried to stop them, and Shi Han and Rongsheng came out to resist, managing to reverse the dangerous situation. The first half ended in a draw.

Switching sides to fight again, South China went all out. Guangsen approached the Hong Kong Combined Team's position, but was entangled by Shi Han and was finally defeated. Biludu became the protector of the forward army, rushing into South China's key area. Mo Shi rushed forward to respond, but fortunately Rongcai calmly dealt with it, turning swords into ploughshares.

Huitang advanced in the middle, receiving a pass from Guangsen. He kicked up and headed the ball out of bounds, which looked pretty good. After a while, Dou Tian passed the ball to Huitang again, who crossed Hanni Bolu. Rongsheng didn't know the direction, and Heli only wanted to save it, but Huitang's kick was already up, and the ball went into the net. Heli could only sigh as he watched the ball. Huitang was originally offside, but the referee didn't see it clearly, so he got this unexpected gain.

The Hong Kong Combined Team first conceded a goal, and was determined to counterattack. Tan Mashi forced a corner kick, but didn't achieve anything. Guangsen raised his troops again, and Heli came out to intercept. Douwen rushed to catch it, but was too hasty and shot out of bounds.

After a while, Zhaohan was injured in a brave battle and left the field, leaving only ten people to fight. Huitang was afraid of losing the rear, so he retreated to the rear army and guarded the inner guard. Unexpectedly, Tan Mashi secretly crossed the border and cut in front of the goal. Lishi rushed forward desperately and kicked the door. Rongcai slapped the ball out, but was intercepted by Haobachen, who passed it back lightly. Garni arrived and kicked it in, reversing the defeat. After that, both sides made progress, but neither side had a chance to win again. At the end of the game, the score was 1-1, and the spring colors were divided equally, and the army was withdrawn down the mountain.

### Swimming Tent at Repulse Bay: Government Has Not Yet Made a Decision to Prohibit Them

Repulse Bay in Hong Kong is a great place to escape the summer heat. Every summer, many residents build tents on the beach for recreation. However, it has recently been rumored that the government will prohibit the construction of tents at Repulse Bay this summer, which has caused concern among those who like to swim there. According to the Director of Public Works, Henderson, the issue of beach tents is under consideration, including whether to allow the construction of tents on the beach there. The committee has not yet reached a conclusion, and it is difficult to predict what its recommendations will be in the future. However, as of now, there is no decision to prohibit the construction of private tents.

### Open Men's Basketball Tournament: Registration Deadline Tomorrow, Reporter Team Prepares to Register and Participate

Since the Hong Kong Basketball Association started accepting registrations for the Men's Open Basketball Tournament, various teams have enthusiastically participated. It has been verified that the teams that have already registered include Pei Yang A and B teams, Indian Police B team, Sing Tao A team, Hong Yuan A and B teams, and the Eastern team. The Zhong Sheng and Li Xing teams have also decided to join, but have not formally registered. Now that the league believes the start date is approaching, it has decided to close registration on the 28th of this month, and will not extend the period. If any teams have not yet registered to join, they can fill out the registration form at the Sing Tao Business Department within a short period of time. Once registration is closed, a representative meeting will be convened, and the opening game can be held around the 10th of next month. Also, the Hong Kong newspaper reporters have a basketball team organization. Last year, they participated in the open tournament and won all seven games, achieving excellent results. When the Sports Special Committee of the Reporters Association was established to manage all sports matters for reporters, the reporter basketball team respected the association's special committee and the members of each team agreed to cancel the team's name. In order to expand their strength, it will be organized by the Sports Special Committee. Now the Sports Special Committee has many good basketball players among its members, and has specially appointed Mao Ziming as the basketball team leader, and Xiao Dianlian and Xu Heng as instructors to take charge of the matter. The Sports Special Committee has been re-elected as a member of the Basketball Association, and as the open tournament will start soon, it has decided to send a team to participate in order to get more opportunities to learn from outside teams. Therefore, starting today, training will begin. At 3 pm, gather at No. 10 Puqingfang, the second school building of Fanglin Middle School, to change clothes, and review the strength on the Xia Park basketball court. If any members who are interested in this sport and want to represent the team, must notify Li Zhiming, the director of the organizing department of the Sports Special Committee (Circulation Daily Editorial Department) no later than 8 pm tonight, otherwise they will be missed when the quota is full. Also, the following gentlemen, please be sure to come to the venue today: Hu Hao, Ma Zhaohua, Liu Xiwena, Liang Zhuchang, Huang Seming, Cheng Baoqi, Liu Bingwei, Lu Yenong, Tang Muran, Pan Zhuoyu, Shao Weixin, Mo Jianyao, Luo Ciqing.

### First Division Football League: Navy Wins Big, Defeating St. Joseph's 6-2

[Special Report from this Newspaper] The Navy football team played a First Division league match against St. Joseph's at the Causeway Bay stadium yesterday afternoon. The Navy is a strong team with the highest hopes of winning the championship, with plenty of talent. In addition, they were eliminated by St. Joseph's in the special silver shield semi-final the other day, leaving them with endless regrets. Therefore, yesterday they came to the league match with their spirits up, determined to win. St. Joseph's, on the other hand, had Gao Shannu absent and Biludu playing for the Hong Kong Combined Team in a charity match, lacking two major players and their strength was slightly reduced. Therefore, in the battle against the Navy, they admitted that they were inferior and were defeated by a large margin of 2-6. Now that the Navy has won another game, their score is even higher.

### Such a Teacher

— Li Liwen

In recent days, the newspapers here have published two such news items:

The former principal of a provincial girls' middle school, ××, did not make a clear account. The school donations collected by him were not accounted for at all. After questioning by the current principal, he also gave ambiguous answers in the newspapers, causing dissatisfaction in the local public opinion.

When the former principal of a county middle school, Yang ××, handed over his duties, he only handed over two national currency to the new principal. After the new principal's thorough investigation, he learned that the former administration was extremely corrupt, and that hundreds of yuan of student deposits and student union donation deposits were also unaccounted for. The students of the school were shocked when they heard the news.

These two news items are of the same type: vaguely speaking, "the account is unclear," and frankly speaking, it is "embezzlement of public funds."

The protagonists of these two news items are also sacred middle school principals.

This makes me unable to avoid feeling a little "something inside."

The purpose of secondary school education is to emphasize the following two points:

a. Laying the foundation for various basic knowledge,

b. Cultivating the character of young people.

Neglecting a is certainly not acceptable, and neglecting b is even more unacceptable. This is naturally very clear. For example, we often say: young people are like a piece of white cloth, which turns red when thrown into a red dye vat, and turns black when thrown into a black dye vat. This means that young people have no opinions of their own. If those who are weak-willed are not properly guided onto the right path, they will rush into the traps. At the same time, we all know that young people are the most precious vitality of the nation and the country. If they are not properly nurtured to become good citizens, the loss to the nation and the country is simply irreparable. Secondary school education precisely undertakes the great task of nurturing the character of young people. Whether a piece of white cloth becomes red or black, secondary school education is actually the person who throws the cloth into the dye vat. In this way, we can understand the importance of secondary school education to the nation and the country. Especially in this era of arduous struggle for the nation, because our struggle cannot be limited in time and is difficult step by step, the nation and the country naturally rely on young people even more, which is to say that the cultivation of young people's character is even more worthy of attention than before. What's more, this is also a watershed era. We must not allow our young people to continue to follow the old, corrupt path. We must guide our young people onto a new, bright path.

But in such a serious period, we still see such two middle school principals. Moreover, we also know that in all sectors, whether military, political, or educational, even to this day, there are still countless people like these two principals. Therefore, I really can't bear to imagine.

However, now is a time of battle, and everything is in battle. In an atmosphere full of wartime emotions, we must not be passive anymore. For the nation, for the country, and for saving the millions of young people facing the abyss! We can no longer tolerate it. We should immediately reach out our fists and launch a fierce battle to eliminate the people around us like those two principals—that is the urgent and important work to be done now. ——In Lingdong

### "Not Knowing the Taste of Meat" and Others

— Hanbo

Recently, a news item about "not knowing the taste of meat" was published in the newspaper, briefly mentioning the general situation of economic panic in the invaders' homeland, such as the gold rush, the soaring meat prices, etc. These are all external factors of "not knowing the taste of meat." In my opinion, it is still more appropriate to annotate the "not knowing the taste of meat" of our neighbors from a psychological point of view.

Since many years ago, when the quasi-wartime social structure entered a real wartime state, the hardships of the neighbors have been enough to eat early on (this naturally refers to the group of people who cannot enjoy the profits of war). However, in the past, they could still pretend to be something, and got by somehow. But now, it is no longer possible. Husbands and sons, wearing a thousand-stitch vest, die in foreign lands. The shops at home are closed down, and those that are not closed are also on the verge of bankruptcy. The recession of non-military industries has shattered their jobs. In addition, there is also the harsh government, which is fiercer than a tiger, and the comfort work that can be assigned at any time... The "source" is cut off and the "flow" is not frugal. The hearts of the widows are broken all year round. When their minds are worn out, they have no energy to do anything. "Absent-minded, eating without knowing its taste," so they "do not know the taste of meat." Needless to say, they can't eat meat. Even if they can eat it, they swallow it with tears. Where do they know whether it is sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, or salty?

"Not knowing the taste of meat" is the sorrow of the invaders' homeland. As for the millions of "soldiers," there are more people who "do not know the taste of salt": "Salt" is not just a reference to the fine white table salt. In a broad sense, the sea contains salt, and the ocean also contains salt. Everything that is indispensable in life contains some abstract flavor—family, hometown, husband and wife, freedom and peace, etc. The "soldiers" in foreign lands smell gunpowder, see the desolate plains and vast mountains, and hear monotonous whistling sounds and monotonous soulless work. There is no purpose in their hearts, no free will. They cannot see the blue sea at the foot of Mount Fuji, and cannot enjoy a bit of saltiness. Sometimes, they are trapped in a desperate situation, which is even more truly "not knowing the taste of salt." The sorrow of these people is completely suppressed by the horse whip. However, judging from the fragmented and known events, it is no less than the sorrow of the people who "do not know the taste of meat."

"Meat" is a healthy nutrient, and "salt" is the vitality of the body and mind. It is unimaginable what the result of "not knowing the taste of meat" and "not knowing the taste of salt" for many years will be. Today's double sorrow will not be difficult to become a double blow in the future. The people who only know how to "march in the alleyways" only think about the long-term existence of military fortunes, but forget that what is more important than "military fortunes" is that they themselves, a class of people, know the taste of salt and meat, but they cannot think of the suffering of those who "do not know the taste of meat" and "do not know the taste of salt." Naturally, they cannot avoid the wailing that will be linked together by these two sorrows in the near future!

### Sending Thoughts Afar

— Dawn Arises

Late night,

The southern port city is quiet,

While a French ship is setting sail at this moment.

It's going to Marseille,

It's going to Venice,

It's going to Liverpool, and also to London,

It's going to all the lands of Europe,

But alas!

Will it also go to where you live?

If possible,

I would like to send a little memory,

Through this massive thing to you.

Or perhaps even tuck in a handkerchief,

With a cloud embroidered along the edge.

When I search through all the shipping routes on the map,

I am disappointed,

Only watching,

With my mouth agape.

### Current Shortcomings of Popular Literature

— Latte

The re-emergence of slogans for current popular literature proves the new awareness of literary authors has become widespread after the war of resistance. At the same time, the theory of popular literature has been considerably enriched and consolidated. Although there are still no large-scale works of popular literature rapidly produced and promoted to the people, when we examine the facts, we cannot but admit that works of popular literature are already competing and advancing, and will surely bloom into a bright flower of literature, creating excellent art for the national war of resistance.

Naturally, we cannot close our eyes and overestimate the merits of current works of popular literature. We should also examine whether its shortcomings are currently quite serious. This is what we must point out first, and hope to overcome.

What shortcomings does current popular literature have in its creation? Generally speaking, there are the following two points:

First, the unconditional use of old forms: It cannot be said to be wrong to use forms loved by the masses and inject content related to the war of resistance and national construction as a tool for propaganda. However, many literary authors often inject content into old forms without disinfection, resulting in an unhealthy combination of form and content, which invisibly causes the loss of a work's appeal to the masses. For example, using vulgar tunes to incorporate propaganda about the brutality of the enemy army, or using grand operas of feudal categories to incorporate the historical facts of national heroes' battles. This will certainly not achieve a powerful expression or an effective response. Unfortunately, some literary authors are committing this problem. It is certainly possible to put new wine in old bottles, but if the old bottle can be washed and disinfected before filling, then the new wine will surely show its better flavor. Therefore, strengthening the careful selection of old forms is something that cannot be ignored.

Second: Loss of diversity in the content of war of resistance and national construction. Although many literary writers have been able to inject the content of war of resistance and national construction into old forms, this content is very monotonous and boring. One work after another sings the praises of flesh-and-blood great walls, and chants the charges of cannons, but rarely do we see reflections of the entire lives of ordinary people in every corner of the war of resistance and national construction, and even less do we see concrete descriptions of the war-weariness and anti-war sentiment of soldiers on the enemy side. This kind of military-centrist popular literature can certainly excite people for a while when first read, but it becomes somewhat tedious after reading further. This also indicates that so-called popular literature with new content in old forms, if not extracting its themes from diverse scenes, will inevitably cause the future of popular literature to stagnate in a very narrow alley. This is also something that cannot be ignored.

I feel that the above two points are common problems with today's popular literature. In order to remedy the shortcomings of the popular literature movement, we must grasp reality, and there is a need to start anew.

### "Drinking Tea" in Leisure

— Baiding

Although my intention is not to "eat heartily" while hiding in the rear, sometimes I cannot help but be "dragged" by friends to a teahouse.

The teahouse is extremely lively. In addition to being packed with people, there are many standing and waiting to "eat." Several waiters shuttle back and forth, shouting "Big buns!" "Shao Mai!" incessantly. Shoe-shining boys, medicine sellers, cosmetic vendors, and even cigarette salesmen busily approach each of the "hearty eaters" to solicit business.

However, the gentlemen who are accustomed to "hearty eating" leisurely light a cigarette and chat with their acquaintances while taking small sips, from counting family treasures to discussing hot political topics—they are truly talking freely!

Not long after my friend and I found a corner to sit down, a rather scruffy-looking gentleman suddenly came over, timidly yet seemingly very respectfully handing over a small piece of paper and walking away. I thought to myself, this is probably some kind of plea for help. But my friend took the paper, glanced at it, and handed it to me, saying, "Guessing back and forth, it's nothing more than these words." I took it and looked at it. It turned out to be a riddle, neatly written with four lines:

"A girl of sixteen is naturally charming,

Her eyes convey affection and steal souls,

Alas, she suffers from lovesickness,

…" (Guess a character)

I thought for a moment and asked my friend, "Isn't this the character 'Ying'?" "That's right!" my friend nodded, while writing the character '櫻' on the back of his cigarette pack.

After a while, the riddle-solving gentleman came to collect the answer, smiling obsequiously, clasping his hands in a bow, his attitude even more respectful than before. He saw the character '櫻' already written on the cigarette pack and said very flatteringly, "Hehe, sir has already guessed it, hehe... Sir, a reward. Hehe..." His hands kept bowing. My friend took out a copper coin from his pocket and gave it to him, saying, "These are all guessed so well, there's no interest."

The riddle-solving gentleman took the coin and said repeatedly, "Thank you, thank you," then pulled out another piece of paper from a stack in his hand and placed it on the table. He then ran to another seat to find a customer. I took it and looked at it. This time, it was not catering to low-level tastes, but had a strong political satirical tone, so I specially copied it down:

"An erotic telegram leaves my heart,

Even the dean steps down,

Two traitors offer the same advice,

Rambling on the war for eleven years" (Guess a character)

What character is this supposed to be? My friend and I thought for a long time but couldn't figure it out, and the riddle-solving gentleman didn't come back to deliver the answer. However, I feel that this kind of riddle, although that riddle-solving gentleman is close to opportunistic, is quite thought-provoking.

### "Strange"

— Ziyou

The newspapers of the 24th of this month reported: "A strange aircraft was spotted in the skies over Kowloon last night." Following the enemy aircraft's "accidental" bombing of British territory, there comes this "strange aircraft." The people of this paradise feel somewhat less "paradise-like."

Shanghai once had strange fires, and the Singapore port also discovered strange sounds a few days ago. Now, a strange aircraft has been spotted in Hong Kong. In this way, the sky, the ground, and the sea all have the potential for "strange" occurrences. Mr. Dong Gong said: "When a state is about to perish, there will surely be monsters." This seems to make some sense! Ha! Ha!

Airplanes and warships being "strange" means either their appearance is unfamiliar or their actions are peculiar, to the point where it is impossible to distinguish them as not strange. After all, the twentieth century is a world of science. "Flying heroes" only show a few children practicing on Mount Emei, and "foreign devils" have been transformed into "foreign masters" for many years. There is nothing inherently strange in the world. The strangeness lies in the people who say it is strange. It's not like the saying, "See the strange and be not strange, and the strangeness will defeat itself." We must face it squarely! Calling those airplanes and warships strange, that is what is strange.

Before July 7th, or to be precise, before August 13th, whenever Japanese airplanes or warships were discovered in Chinese territory, newspapers often wrote "strange aircraft" and "strange warships," but it was an open secret that these were euphemisms for enemy aircraft and enemy warships. Reporters who saw the airplanes did not not know they were enemy aircraft, but due to "good neighborliness" (?), they had to say they were "strange aircraft."

Often, some people are doing things that deceive themselves. Mencius' eating meat while keeping away from the kitchen and Ah Q's spiritual victory are all examples of this. As for clearly and openly getting punched a few times, but in order to maintain friendship, insisting that it is unknown what strange hand ran over him and punched him a few times, this also does not escape the circle of self-deception.

Speaking in roundabout ways is very unpleasant, and is only done as a last resort. Who doesn't know that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line? But what if you are not allowed to walk a straight line? Some people could walk straight, but they love peace too much, no, it's appeasement, but they insist on walking a curved path. Not only do they walk a curved path themselves, but they also try to make others follow them to a place where "this road is blocked." This is a very strange thing.
