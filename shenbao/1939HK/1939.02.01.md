### Proposals of the Fifth Plenary Session

The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang (KMT) was convened at the beginning of the second phase of the all-out War of Resistance. The second phase of the War of Resistance is a stage of turning defeat into victory, and weakness into strength, which has the significance of completing the entire undertaking of resisting the war and building the nation on the basis of the first phase. Therefore, this supreme meeting of the Kuomintang, which leads the War of Resistance, naturally carries a very important mission, and the people of the whole country are also eagerly awaiting the announcement of the resolutions. Although the process and resolutions of this meeting have only been fully announced today, the gains of this meeting are quite significant. Just in terms of the assembly situation, the number of people at this assembly was even more than the previous three times. Although the discussion only lasted for one week, the resolutions were quite specific and in line with current needs. Here are some thoughts on its achievements: According to the main resolutions published in various newspapers, there are sixteen in total, covering all aspects of party, government, military, and economic construction. Regarding the resolutions on party and government affairs, the most important ones are roughly three points: (1) Emphasis on the implementation of methods to improve lower-level party and government organizations; (2) Improving the working methods of the party; (3) Children of party, government, and military personnel at all levels should lead by example in serving in the military. These are very important resolutions. If we speak in the spirit of "not refusing medical treatment for illness," the experience of the eighteen months of the War of Resistance has indeed made us feel that the lower-level party and government organizations are too unsound, and the staff is too corrupt. Furthermore, during the process of the War of Resistance, the upper-level party and government organizations were constantly being improved, but the reform of the lower-level party and government organizations was very lagging behind. Therefore, the work efficiency of the party has also been greatly affected. In addition, party and government personnel at all levels evade responsibility and cannot set an example for the general public, which further hinders the progress of the War of Resistance.

Regarding the resolutions on military affairs, the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council is the most important. According to a special dispatch from Chongqing in this newspaper a few days ago, the Supreme National Defense Council established this time has a more substantial organization than the existing National Defense Conference. It has been decided that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will concurrently serve as the chairman, and the other six members will be filled by two party and government leaders and two highly respected "celebrities outside the government." Here, we can point out two points of progress: (1) The organizational members of the Supreme National Defense Conference are no longer limited to military personnel, but also include party and government leaders. The discussions and resolutions of the National Defense Conference in the future should be better able to adapt to the objective needs of mutual cooperation between the party, government, and military; (2) The Supreme National Defense Conference in the future will no longer be just an organization for upper-level leadership in the War of Resistance. The addition of celebrities outside the government to its organization can, on the one hand, show that our political institutions are becoming increasingly democratic as needed by the War of Resistance. On the other hand, the highest leading body of the War of Resistance can also gain insight into public sentiment and adapt to the demands of the people through the participation of celebrities outside the government, so as to enhance the strength of the War of Resistance. Therefore, the selection of these two candidates from outside the government is of great importance. The main condition is that they truly understand public sentiment and can represent the will of the people. Although the candidates seem to have been internally determined, their relationship is of great importance, so I do not hesitate to bother and remind the authorities of this here. Secondly, improving the conscription methods is also a very important resolution. We often hear many black scenes of conscription fraud in various places, and its disadvantages even affect the people's aversion to war. Today, in the second phase of the War of Resistance, which focuses on "building the army," the improvement of the conscription method is an urgent issue.

The remaining resolutions, generally speaking, are all about methods of economic construction. The main points are nothing more than improving the plan for wartime finance and finance, promoting the production, construction and control of the western provinces, improving foreign trade, and stepping up the promotion of cooperative undertakings. Among them, the improvement of wartime finance and finance is the most important. Not only can it increase the source of huge expenses for military and political affairs, but it can also stabilize wartime industry and the social economy, such as regulating local finance. In addition, encouraging the exchange of cash, silver, and strengthening gold production work and efficiency is also an important case for improving wartime finance. Secondly, improving production and trade is also an important strategy, because war is a huge consumption. In order to fill this consumption, there are only two active methods: one is to increase domestic production, and the other is to increase international income. In this resolution, the regulations on these two parts are quite specific. In terms of production, the focus is on the construction and control of the west. The specific methods are to promote and encourage handicrafts and step up the promotion of cooperative undertakings. In terms of foreign trade, the focus is on encouraging exports and improving foreign exchange. These resolutions are of course basic key points for economic construction, but we still hope that the authorities can do three more things based on these basic resolutions, namely stabilizing legal tender, dredging finance, and facilitating people's transport.

In addition to the resolutions, this conference has two major gains: the anti-war concepts and specific methods indicated by the Chairman's speech, and the three principles indicated in the plenary declaration for promoting anti-war strategies: namely, strengthening unity, actively fighting, and stepping up construction. Regarding the Chairman's instructions, I have already written an article to elaborate on them a few days ago. Now I will briefly talk about the latter three principles. Our War of Resistance is a great undertaking of all-out war, so we must "be united as a country, and have one heart from top to bottom" in order to overcome all difficulties and achieve success. However, unity values sincerity, so all parties and factions must cooperate sincerely with the spirit of "mutual trust." Secondly, our War of Resistance is to fight for final victory, and this kind of War of Resistance is the most difficult fact, so there is a danger of giving up halfway through because of fear of difficulties. The so-called "he who travels a hundred miles is only halfway to ninety" refers to this. We are now only one step away from success. If we can take ten more miles, the final goal can be achieved; otherwise, all previous efforts will be wasted. Therefore, the whole country must endure and overcome this final hurdle. Again, the point about stepping up construction is the key to the specific methods of the War of Resistance. We have repeatedly discussed economic construction, but construction is not limited to the economy. In addition, spiritual construction and political construction are even more important. We must carry forward the education of the Prime Minister's soldier spirit, so that 450 million people will have the spirit of "if we don't succeed, we will die for the cause." We must also "strictly enforce rewards and punishments, comprehensively examine the reality, concentrate our strength, and increase efficiency," especially "strengthen people's organizations, unify people's actions, relieve people's suffering, and improve people's lives" in order to implement political construction.

In short, the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session this time are practical and specific. We sincerely hope that the central and local governments at all levels can implement and promote them in accordance with these resolutions.

Correction: There are three errors in the editorial on the 28th. They are corrected as follows: In the eleventh line of the lower paragraph, "The basic spirit of a planned economy lies in the Three People's Principles of centralization" should be "…democratic centralization." In the thirtieth line of the lower paragraph, "Especially the discipline issue one" should be "…the Party's discipline issue." In the thirty-second line of the lower paragraph, "The Kuomintang is the party of the War of Resistance" should be "The Kuomintang is the party leading the War of Resistance."

### Fierce Fighting Along the Yangtze River in Hubei: Our Two Army Corps Bravely Advance and Press Forward, Stalemate East of Qianjiang

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, January 31] Along the Yangtze River in central Hubei, our troops are engaged in fierce fighting along the Caojiang, Heilu Du, Guanyin Du, Wa Miao Ji, and the Dabie Mountains. Our two army corps are bravely advancing.

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, This Newspaper, January 31] In the battle situation in western Shanxi, we definitely hold the advantage. ×'s claims of a great victory in the Zhongtiao Mountains are purely false. Although there has been fierce fighting over the Zhongtiao Mountains, we still hold all strongholds with no major changes. We have further increased defenses along the river. There has been fierce fighting in Da'an, Gu Ren, and Yongle in recent days. × has suffered 2,000-3,000 casualties, and we have also suffered considerable losses. The battle lines in Xia County, Jiang County, and Pinglu are under our control. × is conducting intense guerrilla warfare against us. × is attempting to invade westward again at Hejin, but we have already blocked them.

Shanxi × Troops Harass in Multiple Directions

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 30th] Military intelligence: × aircraft at Yuncheng have increased to 30-40 in recent days. At Zhangcun and Qucun in southern Yuncheng, there are × 600-700 troops with 7-8 cannons. At Dunhualing and Jiling, there are × over 3,000 troops with over 10 cannons. Since the 23rd, under air cover, they have launched attacks towards Huanglongling, Majiazhuang, and Taohuacha (southeast of Jie County), currently engaged in fierce fighting with our army.

[Central News Agency, Tongguan, 30th] In recent days, × has increased by over 2,000 troops from Yuncheng towards the north, with unclear intentions. × has recently been attacked by our army in Wanquan and other places, with extremely fierce fighting.

[Central News Agency, Yanqu, 30th] The × troops at Huo County launched a two-pronged attack on us at 9:00 AM on the 28th, but were repelled. One group of over 1,500 infantry and artillery, accompanied by four mountain guns, advanced towards our Shawo Li via Qingcao Ping and Yin Di Cun. Our Ai Regiment pre-emptively controlled forces in favorable areas north and south. At noon, × successively entered the vicinity of Shawo Li. At 1:00 PM, our Tian Battalion launched a frontal attack, while the Wang and Guan Battalions launched pincer attacks from the Xiacheng Cun and Jian Kou towards the north and south of ×, respectively. After two hours of fierce fighting, × suffered heavy losses and collapsed. Another group of over 300 infantry advanced towards Jugu Li via Shangxia Dong Ping, but were repelled by Zhang Battalion of our Yue Regiment.

[Central News Agency, Yanqu, 30th] After capturing He Shun County in eastern Shanxi on the 23rd, over 3,000 × troops, a portion of over 1,000 troops, advanced along the Liaohe Highway towards Liao County. On the 27th, they reached Hanhu Town, and on the 28th, they reached Caojiazhai. Our army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with × in favorable areas to prevent their advance.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 30th] Over 1,000 × troops, with over 100 cavalry and nine cannons, launched a four-pronged attack on our Chajianling and Yangjiachuan positions on the morning of the 24th. Our army pre-emptively dispersed its forces and responded with tactical methods. × was unable to grasp our position and retreated. Our army killed over 50 × troops.

Our Armies Achieve Successive Victories in Hubei and Hunan

[Central News Agency, Zhongxiang, 30th] Over 200 × troops from Yingshan, with two cannons, arrived at Haojiadian from Longquan Town and engaged in fierce fighting with our guerrillas for about four hours. × troops were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed eastward. In this battle, the × commander, Captain Ota Kan, was killed, along with over ten soldiers and over ten horses.

[Central News Agency, Changde, 30th] The × troops at Bailu Ji have been harassing various places in recent days. Yesterday, a part of them sneaked to Hejiaqiao, about ten miles away from Zhuqiao. Our army has dispatched a team to meet them.

[Central News Agency, Wanjia Bu, 30th] Our commando team destroyed the railway at Danjia Da Wu on the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway on the night of the 26th. They encountered over 200 × troops and engaged them. After completing their mission, we immediately withdrew.

Our Aircraft Bomb × Warships

[Foreign Dispatch from This Port] According to Chinese sources from Guangzhou Bay this morning, Chinese Air Force bombed Japanese warships parked near Weizhou Island yesterday. It is not yet known whether they were hit. It is also reported that Chinese aircraft also bombed the Japanese army on Sanzao Island.

[Reuters, Guangzhou, 31st] After the situation in Shameen gradually returned to normal, the ban on Chinese entering the area has now been relaxed compared to before. Chinese can freely enter and exit between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM. Martial law remains in effect in Guangzhou, and Chinese and foreigners passing through traffic checkpoints must still present permits for inspection by Japanese sentries. The puppet "Maintenance Association" is currently starting to organize a police force to maintain public order, issuing orders for former police officers to return to their districts to serve.

[Central News Agency, Jiujiang, 30th] On the 28th, over 600 × infantry, over 100 cavalry, and dozens of cannons arrived at Jiujiang. The commander is Major Akio. There are also over 100 × troops at Heqing, numbered as the 3rd Detachment of the Terakawa Garrison. They often send small teams to harass nearby villages.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 31st] At 1:35 PM on the 31st, eight × aircraft took off from Beihai and invaded the skies over Nanning, dropping bombs. At the same time, three × aircraft dropped bombs in Zhaoqing. The extent of the damage is unknown.

[Enlightenment Society, Rapid News from the South Road] Since the invasion of Guangzhou, the southern invading × army has been in place for more than three months. Aside from being able to defend only the outer lines of Nanhai, Panyu, Sanshui, Dongguan, Zengcheng, and Shunde, they have made no further progress. With protracted campaigns failing and war fatigue setting in, the internal contradictions and negative trends of anti-war fervor and financial panic, and the depletion of troop resources are growing more and more prominent. In order to remedy this situation, the × warlords have recently increased naval deployments to Weizhou Island, attempting to land in Guangxi via the Southern Route, Anpu, Beihai, and Qinzhou Bay, cutting off our country's southwest international transportation routes. They also appear to be using the strategy of elite troops to strike quickly, launching attacks in four directions. According to military analysts, the offensive plans of these four directions of × troops will focus on three prongs for the main attack, with one prong as a supporting attack. The main attacks will be: (1) along the Anpu-Lianjiang-Shijiao highway to enter southern Guangxi, Chuanchuan, Yulin, Beiliu, using Beiliu as a base; (2) from the Beiliu base, dividing forces eastwards to Rongxian and Cenxi, to encompass Wuzhou and Taizhou, and westwards to Xingye Guixian and Binyang to seize Yongning; (3) splitting off from Beihai via Qinxian to attack Yongning, encompassing Longzhou Zhennanguan, to cut off Guizhou-Vietnam traffic; (4) as a supporting prong, splitting off from Anpu Lianjiang to Huaxian, Maoming, Xinyi, and Luoding, to occupy Nanjiangkou, cutting off the Xijiang traffic, attempting to shake our army teams, and the positions of Gao Yao and other places in Xijiang, using electric launches and bark boats to leap forward along the river from the river mouth of Sanshui. Examining the strength of the × army, they are on the verge of exhaustion. The limited number of troops sent to the Southern Route this time is a trick using the strategy of elite troops to break through. Geographically speaking, this type of troop advancement strategy of × is several times more difficult than leaping forward along the Xijiang River from the front, because the Gou Lou Mountains on the Guangdong-Guangxi border extend from Annam into the border, with the main peak, Gou Lou Mountain, located southeast of Beiliu County. Its rocky holes and curved leaks stretch from Rong County to Beilun Pass, eastward to the Shiwan Da Mountains, Yunkai Da Mountains, branching into the Yunwu Mountains, stretching across Qinzhou, Lianjiang, Gaozhou, Huaxian, Luoding, Yunfu, and Yulin, which can serve as bases for guerrilla teams in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The Gui province army from Huaiji Cangwu in the southeast, to Longzhou Nanning in the west, has stationed heavy troops in mountain passes and strategic locations, defending them tightly. Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Headquarters and concurrently Chief of Staff, yesterday ordered Xia Wei, Commander-in-Chief of the West Route, to sit in Wuzhou, and Military Commander Liao Lei to sit in Guiping, to preside over military affairs. On the Guangdong side, Hepu Beihai is defended to the death by Gui army division commander Huang Gu, leading troops in cooperation with Qinlian Garrison Commander Mo Shujie. Wu Fei, the Administrative Inspector of the Eighth District, leads the Hepu County Guerrilla Commander of the League Zhuding Hua, the Lingshan Commander Huang Zhisheng, the Qinxian Commander Huang Tongcai, the Fangcheng Commander Mao Xiangcheng, the Suixi Commander Li Jiaju, and the Haikang Commanders Lin Zhaotong and Xuwen Cai Rongchun, leading the self-defense teams of each county to defend key passes. Zhou Jingzhen, the Administrative Inspector of the Seventh District, leads the Maoming County Guerrilla Commander Huang Maoquan, the Huaxian Commander Pang Cheng, the Wuchuan Commander Huang Zhen Lianjiang Commander Kuang Wu,

Commander Xiao Qiu, Xinyi Commander Lai Dongrong, Dianbai Commander Tang Wei, Yangjiang Commander Chen Xiujue, etc., leading the self-defense teams of each county to defend key passes. All divisions, replenishment regimental units, have been sent to Huaxian, Huijiang and other places to gather for war preparations. Gui army commander Xia Wei, has previously increased and transferred two elite divisions to Anpu Beihai to increase defenses. If × were to invade Gui from the Southern Route, a major war will unfold in the mountainous areas on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi. All of the × army's heavy weapons, tanks, and other mechanized units will lose their effectiveness. The assistance of aircraft will also be made more difficult due to the complexity of the rocky mountains. Geographically speaking, the × army will definitely be unable to fight the war in the Southern Route, increasing its number of deaths, injuries, and illnesses, leading to difficulties in terms of finance, economy, politics, diplomacy, and military affairs, and hastening their collapse.

### 乂 Forcibly Demands Scrap Iron in Occupied Areas: When the Akita Maru Sailed to Japan, It Carried Away About 1,000 Tons Again

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Shanghai Dispatch: Since × launched its war of aggression against China, it has consumed a great amount of ammunition and military supplies. Because its domestic steel is insufficient, it has forcibly demanded it from various war zones. Recently, it has forced the puppet government to hold iron donation campaigns on behalf of various puppet counties and cities. The × transport Akita Maru, fully loaded with 1,000 tons of copper and iron, set sail for Japan on the 30th.

### Philippine Police Authorities Strictly Prohibit Private Fishing: Conflict Involving Japanese Fishermen Escalates; Police Chief Announces Details of the Case

[Associated Press, Manila, 31st] The Philippine Islands Police Chief, Mr. Ramos, recently went to Maya Bay to investigate the conflict involving Japanese fishermen on January 19th. He has now completed the investigation and returned to Alki City in northern Luzon, reporting the details of the incident here: The Japanese fishing boat Beya Maru, carrying 28 fishermen, sailed into the port and refused inspection by the water patrol, leading to a dispute. A water patrol ship happened to be passing by and opened fire, injuring the Japanese shipowner, who was then arrested and is currently being held. At the same time, Manila officials have now begun to strictly prohibit private fishing, and 25 fishing boats have been suspended from sailing.

### XinYu Wireless Telephone Soon to Open; Northwest Transportation More Convenient in the Future; Close Relations Between the Central Government and Border Provinces

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 31st] The wireless telephone between Xinjiang and Chongqing made its first test call on the 30th. In the future, transportation in the northwest will be more convenient, truly opening a new era in the history of transportation in our northwest. Previously, the Dihua Radio Telegraph and Wireless Telephone Bureau under the Xinjiang Provincial Government Transportation Office purchased the latest wireless machinery and equipment at great expense, and actively arranged everything. Everything was ready, and it officially opened in Dihua on the 30th. On the afternoon of the 30th, at 4:30 PM, the provincial chairman, Li Rong, made the first test call to the province's representative in Chongqing, Zhang Yuanfu, via wireless telephone. Chairman Li asked Representative Zhang to pay respects to Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, the presidents of various academies, and various military leaders, and said that the whole of Xinjiang is peaceful and the masses are extremely concerned about the war situation. Zhang then reported on the recent political situation in the central government. The two sides spoke for twelve minutes, and the sound was clear. The wireless telephone will be officially put into use soon.

### Japanese Seiyukai Diet Member Kono Criticizes the Hiranuma Cabinet, Pointing Out that the Current Cabinet Lacks Popular Support; Friction Between the Diet and the Cabinet Intensifies

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 31st] Tokyo Dispatch: The × Diet's interrogation campaign is becoming increasingly sharp, revealing that ×'s internal unease and anxiety are like a volcano, beginning to erupt. In both houses of the × Diet, there are many questions regarding the so-called policy of building a "New Order in East Asia," but Hiranuma and Arita's answers still do not deviate from Konoe's statements. In the morning, Seiyukai Diet member Kono Ichiro made a frontal attack on the Hiranuma Cabinet in the House of Representatives Budget Committee, which is noteworthy as it is an unprecedented phenomenon since the outbreak of the war and the last Diet session. Kono said that the Hiranuma Cabinet is the most unpopular cabinet in Japanese history. First, because the Hiranuma Cabinet is an extension of the Konoe Cabinet, and Konoe has already lost popular support, how can Hiranuma reverse the situation? Second, because the Hiranuma Cabinet has no concrete policies that can win the support of the whole country. When Kono asked questions, the entire room was silent, and the cabinet members on the stage listened attentively. Hiranuma, Itagaki, and Yonai frequently exchanged wry smiles. Hiranuma then stood up to answer, saying that the current cabinet is not an extension of the Konoe Cabinet. Although the current cabinet continues the previous cabinet's policy of establishing a "New Order in East Asia," one should not immediately assume that the current cabinet also continues all other policies of the previous cabinet. Kono rose again to attack, expressing his dissatisfaction with Hiranuma's response, but hoping that Hiranuma would quickly reorganize the cabinet and recruit new figures. Thus, a battle of words barely came to an end, but the friction between the Diet and the cabinet, the friction between political parties and Hiranuma, and the anger of the people in the country were all clearly visible. When Seiyukai Diet member Haraguchi asked, in order to carry out a long-term war, it is necessary to make a living and occupy the area. Itagaki replied that he felt the same way and would pay more attention to it. Haraguchi then asked, what are the specific strategies for the joint anti-communist problem? Arita replied that it was under study and could not be made public. Haraguchi then turned to question when the war expenses, which were so huge, would continue. Ishiwatari replied, "I don't know yet, but we should make sure that it is not wasted." From this, it can be seen that in the × House of Representatives, there is a deep aversion to war due to the burden of such huge military expenses, which cannot be extended any further. Oriental Society Diet member Kita Ikki continued to ask, "The military authorities have a tendency to emphasize North China and downplay Central China and South China. We must know that the importance of Central China and South China is no less than that of North China. What is the cabinet's policy?" Itagaki replied, "The military authorities have not downplayed Central China and South China. After Konoe's statement was released, there was a rumor that troops would be withdrawn from Central China and South China, but this is actually a rumor." Yonai also replied, "The navy and the army have the same opinion." From this, it can be seen that the so-called Konoe statement is completely insincere. The Japanese warlords not only want to place North China under their control, but they also tightly grasp Central China and South China. The poison of their intentions is obvious. Kita continued to ask, "What is the period of stationing troops in China?" Itagaki replied, "The period of stationing troops depends on the needs of security and combat, and cannot be predicted." Kita asked again, "How is the food supply for the troops in China resolved?" Itagaki replied, "A part of it is levied locally, and in the future we will strive to have it all supplied locally." From this, it can be seen that × is trying to levy our country's food supply to supply its troops, saving labor and reducing the burden of transportation. We should thoroughly destroy their tricks.

### ××The People Are Sick of the War of Aggression; A Strong Atmosphere of Peace Inside the Country; Many University Professors in Prison

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 31st] Army Minister Itagaki declared in the Diet yesterday that the recent rumors that Japanese military operations in Central China and South China will end soon are completely unfounded. At the same time, Navy Minister Yonai also said that even if the war situation comes to an end, Japan will still send the navy to China to garrison.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 31st] Education Minister Araki gave a speech in the Diet, expressing regret over the issue of some professors violating the law. However, the Japanese government will purge dangerous elements in imperial universities to achieve the goal of building an ideal university. Also, Treasury Minister Ishiwatari said in the Diet that extreme attention has been paid to the development of the economic productivity of Japan, its puppet states, and China.

### Hengyang Four Major Events (Continued from yesterday's Second Edition)

— Wang Ping

"Friends of the Wounded Soldiers" Movement

Hengyang is located at a vital point on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, making it one of the gathering places for wounded soldiers. In addition to several collections of cotton clothes and quilts and regular慰勞 (consolation/comfort) efforts, local people, along with a foreign friend, organized a "Friends of the Wounded Soldiers" movement and are preparing to expand the movement nationwide.

The meaning of "Friends of the Wounded Soldiers" can be fully understood from the name itself; it is organized entirely to serve the wounded soldiers. They initiated two movements in Hengyang to wash clothes and cut hair for the wounded soldiers, and the results were quite good. It is only a pity that the organization is not very sound, lacking dedicated personnel and more people/groups participating to widely promote the movement. It seems that it has now reached a "standstill."

Establishment of a Symposium on Anti-Japanese War Work

It is said that Hengyang is the most complex place in Hunan, and the deep-rooted feudal forces are unmatched by other places. Based on the reporter's observations over a long period, this is indeed the case: the struggle between new and old forces, and the internal contradictions within the new and old forces, can be seen from all aspects.

Therefore, in the anti-Japanese war work, everyone acts on their own, indifferent to each other—and even slandering each other. This is indeed a great loss to the work. After several lessons, everyone felt that they should overcome this immediately, otherwise, the devil's hands of the × people will soon reach this ancient city. However, no one was willing to propose it, so the newly created "New Stage" ten-day publication and the visiting group, the Eighth Team of the Anti-Japanese Drama Troupe of the Political Department of the Military Commission, raised this request at a meeting to welcome the Guizhou War Zone Working Group. It immediately received a satisfactory response. Each group immediately sent a representative to form an "Anti-Japanese War Work Symposium." All working groups and cultural institutions in Hengyang were members. They met once a week, and each group took turns convening. The topic of the symposium was determined at the previous meeting and could be added or deleted by the convener. The first symposium has already been held. The topics discussed were how to develop the work in Hengyang and strengthen the anti-Wang Jingwei movement.

Slowly, Hengyang will stand up in the anti-Japanese war, stand taller, and contribute more.

Finally, a new publication "New Stage" has been published here, with Wen Tao, a famous woodcut artist, and Xiang Yu as the persons in charge. This is entirely a people's publication. The first issue contains the full text of Chairman Chiang's instructions, Zhou Enlai's discussion of the recent war situation, a special anti-Wang Jingwei issue, and Mr. Ye Jianying's "The War Situation in the New Stage" written specifically for the publication...etc. The sales are quite good, and it is likely to become one of the cultural pillars of the Southwest.

January 17th, in Hengyang

### Fascist Countries Plan Further Collusion; Japanese House of Representatives Once Discussed; Shiratori Toshio Active in Europe

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 30th] Tokyo News: Today, the House of Representatives held a budget debate, which discussed strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact and war expenses. Seiyukai member Haraguchi first proposed strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact. Haraguchi argued that the pact should be strengthened. Foreign Minister Arita replied that although various newspapers have different records of the purpose of the Anti-Comintern Pact, the pact was originally established by the contracting countries to jointly prevent communist "destructive activities" and had no other purpose. The Foreign Minister declined to explain what specific measures the Japanese government is currently considering to stop the "destructive activities" of the Communist Party. As for war expenses, Japanese Minister of Finance Ishiwata said that it is still difficult to determine when the Japanese government will issue the war expenses raised for the "Sino-Japanese Incident." However, the war expenses raised by the Japanese government due to the European War started in 1916 and continued for ten years. The war expenses used during the European War were paid separately by the government, he said.

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 30th] Tokyo News: A Foreign Ministry spokesman said that regarding the recent meeting of Japanese ambassadors and ministers to several European countries in Paris, although various newspapers have different records, its purpose was to have the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori Toshio, report on the news about China and Japan to the ambassadors. The spokesman also hinted that similar meetings will be held in Berlin and Rome.

### Norwegian Merchant Ships Still Not Released; Norwegian Official Lodges Protest

[Associated Press Shanghai, 31st] A Japanese military spokesman admitted that Norwegian officials had protested the Japanese detention of Norwegian ships in Qingdao, but the two ships have still not been released. The spokesman added that the detention of the British ship "Paul" has been satisfactorily resolved by the British and Japanese sides, and the "Paul" has now been escorted from Qingdao to Shanghai by the British warship "Birmingham."

### Aw Boon-Haw Mining Group Arrived in Yunnan Some Days Ago

[Our Newspaper Kunming, January 30th, Special Dispatch] (Delayed) The mining group organized by Aw Boon-Haw has arrived in Yunnan and will go to various counties to explore and mine in the coming days.

### Four Thousand Refugees Go to Yunnan to Build Roads

[Our Newspaper Kunming, January 31st, Special Dispatch] The Central Relief Commission has decided to allocate 4,000 refugees to Yunnan to participate in the construction of the Yunnan-Burma and Sichuan-Kunming Railways.

### Zhejiang Province Controls Freight Transport in Oujiang and Ningbo Rivers

[Shanghai Correspondence] Wenzhou and Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang are the only navigable ports after the war. The export of native products from the interior and the import of foreign goods are both transshipped through the two ports. The Zhejiang Provincial Government is planning to establish a Monopoly Bureau to control freight transport and develop the efficiency of transportation, while also organizing joint water and land transport with Jiangxi, Fujian, and Hunan provinces. The details are as follows:

Cargo Volume Soars at Ningbo and Oujiang Ports After the war, the volume of cargo entering and leaving the ports of Wenzhou and Ningbo has soared. The original customs has increased the number of customs officers to provide services, and tax revenue has increased accordingly. For example, last year, the value of goods imported into Wenzhou Customs was 1,923,000 yuan in national currency, and the value of goods exported was 6,240,000 yuan in national currency. The value of goods imported into Ningbo Customs was 1,212,000 yuan in national currency, and the value of goods exported was 4,768,000 yuan in national currency. The increase in exports set a new record for the two ports. In the previous year, Ningbo Customs exported only 26,000 yuan, and Wenzhou Customs exported only 541,000 yuan.

Establishment of a Monopoly Bureau to Control Freight Transport The Zhejiang Provincial Government, recognizing that Wenzhou and Ningbo have become important ports for the import and export of goods from various inland provinces, resulting in a limited number of ships and a state of undersupply, causing shipowners to arbitrarily raise prices, and merchants to feel great pain, has now planned to establish a Monopoly Bureau by the Finance Department to control freight transport in the Oujiang and Ningbo Rivers in order to regulate the social economy, dredge freight transport, increase provincial treasury revenue, and develop the efficiency of transportation.

### Hitler's Speech: Demands Colonies, Declares Intention to Aid in Wartime, Openly Shields Japan's Invasion of China

[Reuters, Berlin, January 31st] Hitler's long-awaited speech to the Reichstag was finally delivered last night at the Kroll Opera House. The theater was filled, with not only all members of the Reichstag in attendance, but also members of the diplomatic corps. Overall, the entire speech contained no surprises, nor did it hint at any future actions of the Nazi Party. The main points of the speech were roughly: (1) to reiterate the demand for colonies; (2) to reaffirm that Germany would be Italy's ally in wartime; (3) to make clear that Germany would not tolerate any interference from Western countries in its internal affairs. Furthermore, Hitler fiercely attacked Jews, stating, "If international Jewish financiers attempt to incite another great war, the result will not be the destruction of Germany, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe." At the beginning of his speech, Hitler recounted to the 85 members of the "Greater German" Reichstag the circumstances of the Nazi Party's rise to power on January 30th six years prior. "At that time, approximately 130 million male and female citizens voted, supporting the Nazi Party under my leadership. Another 20 million voters were scattered among about 15 other small parties, united only by their shared hatred of the Nazi movement. They engaged in a long-term struggle against the Nazi Party, vying for leadership and colluding with Jews to protect their interests. Bishops with political agendas in various churches blessed these individuals. The situation was such that only a 'miracle' in the final moment could save Germany's life. We were confident in this 'miracle,' while our enemies mocked it. If Germany had indeed fallen into Bolshevik chaos, Western civilization as a whole would have faced an unimaginable crisis. The emergence of Mussolini and Italian Fascism marked the beginning of a glimmer of hope in Europe. After our Nazi Party gained power, we expanded this movement on another front. Today, we witness the international Jewish conspiracy being bravely overthrown by us, as they sought to diminish Europe and its culture. Over six years, we have realized dreams of centuries past, though the ignorant and unknowing may believe we have not experienced any struggles. They fail to realize that before the unification of Germany this year, we fought bitterly for our political ideals for nearly 20 years. We held firm resolutions, acted bravely, and fought for the victory of these ideals." Hitler then revisited the events of 1938, explaining in detail the annexation of Austria and the final unification of "East Prussia" with Germany. "We expedited the success of all these endeavors with breathless speed. Our faith in the swiftness and efficiency of the new German army has not only not disappointed us but has surpassed our expectations." Hitler mentioned the German army's mobilization during the Czech crisis, saying, "We did not threaten anyone. We merely sought to defend ourselves against unwarranted interference from third parties. This has been the case in the past, and it will be in the future. If any Western European country interferes in matters solely concerning us, preventing the fair and natural resolution of these issues, we will absolutely not tolerate it. Our good friend Mussolini suggested that we should immediately seek out certain principles that would not only allow for the peaceful resolution of pressing issues but also provide a rational approach to all other important matters. We were all delighted by this suggestion. The composed acceptance of Mussolini's proposal by Chamberlain and Daladier is also worthy of our respect. Such unity among strong nations could not have been achieved without a determination to find a solution to this problem. While we do not need to brandish swords to achieve domestic unity, we must resort to such measures for self-defense in the face of external intimidation. German youth have undergone their first trial and emerged with honor." Hitler then solemnly declared that for a country to be strong, it must have domestic discipline, order, and unified national action.

German Economy Hitler also mentioned the economic situation in Germany and foreign rumors of an impending economic collapse due to a "credit panic," stating, "One thing is fully understood by the German people: Germany has always been in a particularly difficult economic position. There is no doubt that we must fight, but there is also no doubt that we will achieve victory. And I dare to tell you plainly that we have already won." Hitler denied the claims by democratic nations that Germany coveted the Netherlands. He stated, "Some people falsely claim that because the political systems of countries like America, South America, and the Netherlands differ from Germany's, we will attack them. This is absolutely untrue. We have no desire to export National Socialism." Hitler also stated that from an economic perspective, depriving Germany of its colonies was utterly meaningless. Before the war, democratic politicians heard that British trade would greatly increase after Germany's disintegration, but after the war, the British people were not any wealthier than before. "Germany's strength today is unprecedented. We do not want to use colonies as bases for troop deployment. We are quite content with our large population. However, we need colonies to solve Germany's economic problems. We need to buy food and raw materials and sell manufactured goods. The quality of our products is no less than that of other countries. Economists often say that the value of currency is based on gold reserves. This is ridiculous. We believe that the value of the German Mark must be based on the ability of its workers and the quality of its products. To alleviate Germany's economic difficulties, first, its living space should be expanded. Currently, this space cannot be fully utilized by Germany, so Germany must increase exports. From an economic standpoint, returning colonies to Germany is the more sensible approach. It is more important to provide jobs for seven million unemployed people than to increase wages. We must export goods to buy food, or we will starve to death. However, I can assure you that the German people will continue to survive, and their leaders are willing to exert every effort to work diligently. Furthermore, Germany harbors no hatred towards Britain and France and wishes to live in peace with them. We have already used German newspapers as our mouthpiece to respond to all those who profit from war, and we have told Germans that Germany has an average population of about 135 people per square mile, with no room to accommodate Jews. Other countries have more room, but they say they cannot accommodate them. If the international Jewish financial group launches another war, the result will not be the destruction of Germany but the annihilation of Jews throughout Europe."

Disarmament Issues Hitler addressed the relationship between politics and religion, stating, "If the Church feels dissatisfied with the current situation, Germany is prepared to follow the example of the United States and separate politics and religion." Hitler expressed his views on disarmament issues, stating, "It would be more appropriate for all countries to first negotiate political and colonial issues with Germany from an economic standpoint, rather than wasting huge amounts of money on arms merchants and burdening the people. Conversely, if politicians in other countries want to threaten us with economic sanctions, I can assure you that if this happens, it will trigger an economic war. In this war, we will be better equipped to cope than other countries whose 'productivity has already exceeded the saturation point.' Furthermore, if Italy is drawn into war, Germany will absolutely assist Italy. Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany will guarantee the safety of European culture. Germany's assistance to the Spanish Nationalists was because Germany did not want Spain to become Bolshevik. The Nationalists will save the Spanish people and annihilate 'political missionaries' or enemies of the Spanish people. Germany had previously attempted to unite various Protestant churches but failed due to the resistance of a few bishops. I believe the world will have a long period of peace; only rumor-mongers believe war is imminent. Germany has no territorial demands on Britain and France, except for colonies. If they think the colonies are worthless, they should return them to Germany, which would not displease them. It is ridiculous for some to claim that Germany is incapable of managing colonies. If we examine the arguments of all opponents, we will see that today's problem is one of strength and not one of justice or reason. A country cannot maintain its economic survival without sufficient space and necessary raw materials. Our relationship with North America has been maligned by unfounded rumors. We will not allow the United States to interfere in our internal affairs. Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Yugoslavia are all neighbors, and our trade relations with the Balkans are also good. We hope that the internal situation in Czechoslovakia can be rectified and that it will not once again adopt the dangerous policies of its former president, Beneš."

German-Japanese Relations Hitler expressed his views on German-Japanese relations, stating, "Today, this world is threatened by Bolshevism but marches blindly forward. Our relationship with Japan was decided after confirming the need to do everything possible to stop the tide of Bolshevism. I believe the Anti-Comintern Pact will become the crystallization of several countries because the ultimate goal of these countries is none other than to eliminate the Bolshevik devil, a threat to world peace and culture. Japan has shown many heroic examples in the past year (?) They are indeed fighting for culture on the other side of the world (?) Therefore, the collapse of Japan would not benefit any civilized nation in Europe or elsewhere in the world but would only lead to the victory of Bolshevism in the Far East (?)". Hitler's speech lasted two hours. After the speech, Goering thanked him for his achievements over the past six years. Finally, he shouted "Hail Victory," at which point all members sang the German national anthem and the Nazi Party anthem. Officials announced that Hitler's speech would be broadcast in a simplified form in English, French, and Italian.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, January 30th] Hitler's speech commemorating the sixth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, long anticipated by all parties, will be delivered at 8:00 PM this evening. According to reliable sources, Hitler's speech will be the longest of his life. Sources with inside information say that the speech is nearly 200 typed pages, and even with wide spacing, it cannot be completed in less than two hours. The speech is extremely important. It is said that Hitler made final revisions to incorporate the latest news.

[Reuters, Berlin, January 30th] Before Hitler's speech to the German Reichstag this evening, German Interior Minister Frick declared that the country's four-year self-sufficiency plan would be implemented for another four years. General Goering has been unanimously re-elected as Speaker of the Reichstag.

International Commentary [Haitong News Agency, London, January 31st] Political circles here are quite satisfied with Hitler's speech to the Reichstag because recent rumors have been dispelled, and they are pleased that Hitler reaffirmed his guarantee that Germany has no territorial demands on Britain and France. However, they are somewhat dissatisfied that Hitler did not endorse Chamberlain's proposal at Buckingham Palace to hold consultations among all relevant countries. Most newspapers also argue that there will be a long period of peace. The Daily Mail expressed sympathy for Germany's demand for its former colonies, saying that Chamberlain should seize the opportunity to resolve the colonial issue because Britain is the guarantor of Germany's former colonies and should initiate this move for moral and obligatory reasons. It also stated that Hitler did not encourage Italy to reclaim its colonies. The News Chronicle reported that Britain should address the colonial issue as part of international relations and resolve it together with arms limitation. Barrett commented on Hitler's speech in the paper, saying that the German leader's speech should reassure those in democratic countries concerned about the international situation.

[Central News Agency, Washington, January 31st] Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said last night after listening to Hitler's speech on the radio that if Hitler's future actions are as moderate as his speech, war is not likely to break out immediately. The State Department is paying close attention to Hitler's statement that Germany will assist Mussolini no matter what.

[Haitong News Agency, Washington, January 31st] Last night, all major newspapers here rushed to print extra editions, publishing the full text of Hitler's speech. They paid particular attention to Hitler's remarks on supporting Italy and whether the United States has the right to interfere in Germany's relations with South American Latin countries. Officials have not yet expressed their opinions.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, January 31st] "Le Petit Parisien" published an article today criticizing Hitler's speech, saying, "Mr. Hitler is not necessarily seeking to create a crisis," but pointed out that Hitler's main goal is to "maintain the Rome-Berlin Axis." Other right-leaning newspapers also echoed, praising Hitler's statement, "I believe in lasting peace."

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, January 31st] Hitler's speech to the Reichstag was broadcast throughout Italy. Millions of people, due to the tense relationship between France and Italy, expressed excitement upon hearing Hitler's message that Germany would provide assistance if Italy were attacked. According to government sources, Hitler's speech is a new proof of the stability of the Rome-Berlin political axis.

### Soviet Third Five-Year Plan: Economic Construction Program, Molotov to Report, Striving to Increase Military Supplies Production

[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, January 30th] Communist Party Chairman Molotov will present the economic construction program of the Third "Five-Year Plan" at the Communist Party Congress to be held in March of this year. According to its principles, it is indeed striving to increase the production rate of military supplies. The plan will be implemented from 1938 to 1942. According to the report published in today's newspaper, the total industrial production of the Soviet Union can still be doubled by 80 percent within these five years. That is, in 1942, the production of production tools (machines, etc.) can be increased by two times and 35 percent. The gold industry and machine manufacturing industry can increase by two times and 55 percent compared with 1937. The military supplies industry is included, and all these industries will occupy a primary position in the future economic construction period. The chemical industry will increase by two times and 77 percent, the electrical industry by 6 percent, the coal production by one time and 81 percent, the steel production by one time and 52 and 56 percent, and the timber production by one time and 80 percent. The Soviet authorities hope that "strengthening workers' discipline" and implementing the Stakhanovite production method can achieve the above-mentioned goals. If so, by 1942, the annual production volume can be increased to 62 billion rubles.

[Associated Press, London, January 31st] According to sources here, Prime Minister Chamberlain will deliver a speech in Parliament on Tuesday, and Mussolini may also deliver a speech on Wednesday.

[Reuters, London, January 31st] Today, the British House of Commons debated foreign policy events. Although the focus will be on Europe, it is expected that Members of Parliament concerned about Chinese affairs will urge the government to take more active action in the Far East, namely, to assist China on the one hand and safeguard British interests in China on the other.

### Brief Commentary: British Imperial Airways Plane Attacked

Yesterday (January 31st), the British Imperial Airways plane, the "Delhi," was flying from Hong Kong when, while passing over the west of Weizhou Island, it was suddenly bombarded by Japanese warships. Details can be found on the Hong Kong news page of today's newspaper. This matter deserves our serious attention and should prompt all friendly nations to make a stern representation.

First, we must understand that since launching a full-scale invasion of China, the Japanese aggressors first blockaded our country's coast, cutting off our maritime transportation with friendly nations. They then attempted to blockade our country's skies, cutting off our air transportation with friendly nations. Although the × people have justified this illegal action as a special wartime situation, the important purpose is to cut off trade with China and undermine the interests of various countries in the Far East, in addition to military significance. Moreover, the Japanese aggressors have not formally declared war on our country and have not obtained the rights of a belligerent state. Therefore, the Japanese side has repeatedly attacked the merchant ships and civil aircraft of various countries, constantly creating terrorist incidents, which is not only a disregard for the rights of third countries but also a crazy provocation against third countries.

Second, since launching a full-scale invasion, and speaking only of the skies, the Japanese have successively attacked the China National Aviation Corporation's "Nanjing" and "Zhejiang" aircraft, jointly operated by China and the United States, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's No. 15 aircraft, jointly operated by China and Germany, and the British Imperial Airways' "Dorado" aircraft. Because various countries only protested at the time and did not impose effective sanctions, the Japanese side has become increasingly bold and rampant. Now, if Britain, the United States, and other friendly nations tolerate this kind of ×× provocative ×× destructive behavior without thinking of closely uniting to deal with it effectively, then terrifying unfortunate events will inevitably become more frequent and severe.

Finally, we must especially point out that as long as the Japanese aggressors do not withdraw from China, the interests of friendly nations such as Britain, the United States, and France in the Far East will be unprotected. Therefore, people from all friendly nations should step up efforts to urge their governments to take active actions to aid China and restrain Japan. For example, in response to the Japanese atrocities of indiscriminately attacking aircraft, they can step up assistance to our country with aircraft and technical personnel, and strengthen our country's air force, so as to protect the safety of the skies.

### Hitler's Wild Words

Berlin, January 31st, reported that Hitler delivered his "speech eagerly awaited by the world" in the Reichstag on the evening of the 30th. He declared that the current attitude of Fascist Germany is (1) to demand colonies; (2) if Italy participates in the war, Germany will absolutely assist Italy; (3) to resolutely support Japan's invasion of China. From this, it can be seen that what those "eagerly waiting" people got was not peace but a greater war threat!

Hitler's first demand, the so-called recovery of colonies, is in fact a demand to expand the war and newly divide the world. Because everyone knows that Germany's old colonies are mostly poor and disease-ridden areas, which absolutely cannot "remedy Germany's economy" nor can they supply "the food and raw materials needed by Germans." Hitler's so-called "recovering colonies can give seven million unemployed workers jobs" is purely a deception of the people. If one examines Hitler's "achievements" in the six years since he took power, and looks at the severe economic crisis and the poverty of the people in Germany today, it will be even clearer that the recent surge in anti-Hitler movements within Germany is by no means accidental. Hitler is now not satisfied with the plunder of Austria and Czechoslovakia, but is still using the slogan of recovering colonies to intensify the expansion of external wars, which is precisely a manifestation of shifting the internal crisis to compete with Britain and France for territorial sovereignty.

Hitler's speech especially emphasized Germany's determination to assist Italian aggressors in fighting and to defend the invasion of China by Japanese fascist warlords, which further proves the fact that the international fascist aggression front and the democratic countries' peace front are in serious opposition. There are still a few people in our country who adhere to the superficial theory of pros and cons that seems to be right but is actually wrong, denying the fact that the aggression front and the peace front, which are truly combined due to interests, are in serious opposition. For example, yesterday, various newspapers published news from the German aggressors, and some people even interpreted it as Germany and the Soviet Union getting closer and Germany and Italy being about to disregard Japan. Although it may make people happy on the surface, in reality, this kind of argument is like a dream. This can be seen from Hitler's speech in support of Japan and Italy. We must eliminate emotions and fantasies when observing the facts. We are not afraid to face the ugly reality, and we must not only not cover it up but also urge people to be especially vigilant.

Fascist aggressors have grown stronger under the compromise policies of the British and French authorities, but their abnormal development has also increased their internal crises. Therefore, they will launch even more crazy external adventures, and their collusion - between Germany, Japan, and Italy - will inevitably become closer. They are still making wild threats, fabricating words to alienate peaceful countries, and slandering the Soviet Union. We must develop the peace front and severely打击them. We must also help the people's front within the aggressors to expand and jointly overthrow the strongholds of fascist aggressors.

### Arbitrary ×× Imperial Airways Plane Flies Over Weizhou Island × Warship Actually Opens Fire Grounded Aria Suffers Danger Yesterday Morning Shortly After Taking Off From Hong Kong Fortunately the Pilot Quickly Evades Disaster Arriving Safely in Hanoi

Yesterday morning, Imperial Airways' plane, the "Ge-li-li-ya", flew from Hong Kong to Penang. While passing over Weizhou Island, it was unexpectedly attacked by ×× with artillery fire. Fortunately, the pilot calmly dealt with the situation and evaded swiftly, thus avoiding the clutches of ×× and arriving safely in Hanoi. However, it was a close call. After the incident, the plane immediately sent a telegram to Hong Kong to report the details, which are as follows:

West of Weizhou Island Suddenly Attacked by × Artillery Fire

Imperial Airways' Hong Kong-Penang air route had two planes flying out yesterday. The route first landed in Hanoi, unloaded passengers and mail, and then transferred to Penang. The "Ge-li-li-ya" and "Dan-na-bo-na" planes flew out as scheduled yesterday morning. The "Ge-li-li-ya" took off at 7:00 AM, carrying two passengers, Mr. Deri and Mr. Mike-chuchen. The pilots were Wilson and San-wei-lu, as well as some mail. Mr. Deri would transfer to Sydney, Australia, after arriving in Penang from Hong Kong, while Mr. Mike would go directly to Penang. As for the "Dan-na-bo-na", it flew out at 7:30 AM, carrying two passengers, Mr. Mei-li-shi, the General Manager of Imperial Airways in the Far East, and Mr. Jian-shi-da, an employee of Imperial Airways in Australia, as well as a batch of mail. Shortly after the two planes flew out one after another, the Kai Tak Airport communications station suddenly received an urgent telegram from the "Ge-li-li-ya", stating that while flying over the west of Weizhou Island, they were suddenly fired upon by anti-aircraft guns from a Japanese warship anchored off the coast of Weizhou Island. The telegram was very brief, and the outcome was unknown. The communications station immediately sent a telegram to inquire about the news, but did not receive a reply. At 11:25 AM, the communications station received a second telegram from the "Ge-li-li-ya" in Hanoi, stating that it and its sister plane, the "Dan-na-bo-na", had safely arrived in Hanoi, and that both people and planes were unharmed. The company was relieved after receiving the telegram.

Imperial Airways Attacked This is the Second Time

After receiving the news that the "Ge-li-li-ya" had been attacked by × artillery fire, the reporter immediately visited Mr. Morse, the director of Kai Tak Airport, to inquire about the incident. Mr. Morse declined to comment, only stating that it was a fact that the plane had been attacked, but fortunately it had not been hit and had now safely arrived in Hanoi. It is understood that this is the second time that a British Imperial Airways plane has been attacked by × warships. The first time occurred in March last year, when the "La-duo" plane was in danger. At that time, it was almost shot down by × warships, and shrapnel had penetrated the passenger cabin. Fortunately, the pilot remained calm and escaped disaster. Afterwards, the × authorities apologized to the British, claiming that they had mistaken it for a Chinese plane, leading to the accidental firing.

### Preliminary Hearing for Shooting of British Detective Concluded Huang Shu's Theft Detailed Determination Examination Officer Describes the Situation of Detaining the Defendant Defendant Admits to Shooting British Detective to Escape

The man Huang Shulun (also known as Li Xiuxi) was previously charged with the case, alleging that he had, late at night on December 2nd of last year, shot British police officer Ta-lu-te at No. 26 Des Voeux Road Central, above the Wing On Bank, with intent to harm, and privately possessed firearms and ammunition on the third floor of the Luk Kwok Hotel. This case was formally brought for preliminary hearing by the Central Magistracy Justice Yi Si at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday, but because the testimony had not yet been fully recorded, it was brought up for further hearing at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon. First, British police officer Hua-jia testified about receiving orders to search the Wing On Bank on the morning of December 3rd last year, and finding three bullet casings in the corridor. Next, Yu Liang, the room manager of the third floor of the Luk Kwok Hotel, testified that the defendant checked into the hotel last December, using the name Li Xiuxi, and stayed in room 317 on the third floor. On the night of the 2nd of that month, around 1:20 AM, Yu saw the defendant return to his room from outside. Then, British police officer Ao Yun testified about going to Queen Mary Hospital to retrieve the plaintiff Ta-lu-te's bloodstained clothes and filing the case at the police station. After that, Examination Officer Shi Shi testified, briefly stating that on the morning of December 3rd last year, he and many colleagues went to the Wing On Bank to search, and as a result, they found three bullet casings. Then, they went to room 317 of the Luk Kwok Hotel and knocked on the door. A woman opened the door (i.e., the dancer Chen Aili, who had previously been accused of colluding with Huang Shulun to privately possess firearms and ammunition). After entering, he saw a person lying in bed covered with a quilt. He pushed the person awake, and upon seeing the person, it was the defendant currently accused in court. Later, he found a handgun and three bullets in his bed at 6:25 AM. Then, he charged him with the case, stating that he was charged with three crimes: (1) harming the body of police officer Ta-lu-te, (2) attempted murder, and (3) privately possessing firearms. Shi Shi then explained the charges to the defendant in English. The defendant then replied, "I really had no intention of harming Ta-lu-te, and he is not my enemy. However, because my actions were being monitored and I could not escape, I was forced to fire the gun in hopes of escaping. The gun belongs to me and is not licensed, but this matter has nothing to do with Chen Aili." Next, Yu Xiongqu, the secretary of the Wing On Bank, testified, briefly stating, "I found a bullet hole on the edge of the door on the third floor that went straight through the wall, about two inches wide, and another bullet mark on the door frame." The recording of the testimony was completed at around 4:00 PM. The judge ruled to submit the case for detailed determination.

Special Feature

### A Group of Poor and Helpless Compatriots The Life of Rickshaw Pullers

— Compassion

Poor and helpless compatriots are most likely to gain people's sympathy. As the ancient saying goes, "The heart of compassion is in everyone." The compassion of people from all walks of life in Hong Kong is very strong, as fully demonstrated in disaster relief work and saving refugees in war zones!

Rickshaw pullers, a group of poor and helpless people, have a very difficult life. If they rent rickshaws directly from the rickshaw company, the rent is six dimes per car, and miscellaneous expenses are several yuan per day, which is a relatively small burden. As for those cars issued by the "pi tou" (middlemen), there is an additional layer of indirect exploitation. They must first pay the "pi tou" a tea fee of twenty-four yuan... Two people pull a car, and the "pi tou" earns forty-eight yuan per car for nothing... A deposit of twenty-two yuan, and a daily rent of six to six and a half dimes. They can temporarily live in the rickshaw hall. Such a heavy burden is really not easy to maintain. In today's developed transportation, the business of rickshaws is very limited. The daily income is at most one yuan (those who pull during working hours earn even less). In addition to the car rental and various miscellaneous expenses, two meals are not easy to maintain. Those with children are even more miserable!

There are more than 350 rickshaws in Kowloon, and about 800 to 900 rickshaw pullers. The rickshaws are issued by five companies: Yan Chengkun, Huang Xixiang, Gu Zi'an, Zhou Yaoting, and Maofeng. The companies and the "pi tou" and the rickshaw pullers are usually at peace with each other. However, the "pi tou" Yan ×× of ××× is particularly different. His exploitation of rickshaw pullers is particularly severe, and he constantly imposes unreasonable oppression. Yan ×× receives 15 rickshaws from the ××× company and pays the company a rent of five dimes per car per day, but he charges the rickshaw pullers eight dimes (two and a half to three dimes more than other companies and "pi tou"). He pockets several dimes for nothing, and he also exceptionally charges the rickshaw pullers a monthly lodging fee of two yuan, but in reality, he does not provide a place for the workers to live—because his rickshaw hall is very small. There are 33 workers in the entire hall. He collects the lodging fee but uses the rickshaw hall for business, selling porridge and herbal tea, etc. The workers have no choice. They pay the lodging fee but have no place to live, so they have to rent a place to live separately. Yan ×× forcefully extorts two yuan from each person every month for nothing!

Of course, the workers cannot bear this unreasonable ××. The difficult life forces the workers to make reasonable demands on Yan ××: like ordinary "pi tou", reduce the car rental to six or six and a half dimes, and at the same time, provide a place to live. However, Yan ×× ignores them and continues to oppress the workers. These rickshaw pullers were forced to repeatedly request a reasonable solution from the Chinese Civil Transportation Department several days ago in accordance with the law, but it has not been resolved yet. Yan ×× continues to increase the rent as usual, and also falsely accuses the workers, using the excuse to dismiss more than a dozen workers—confiscating the tea fee and deposit, and renting the rickshaws to other pullers—this kind of unreasonable oppression is beyond human common sense—the life of rickshaw pullers cannot be solved, and this kind of unreasonable oppression can no longer be tolerated. They decided to request a reasonable solution from the Chinese Civil Transportation Department again in accordance with the law, and also sent letters to the ××× Association and Mr. ××× to uphold justice, so that this incident can be resolved as soon as possible, so that these dozen rickshaw pullers and their families will not starve to death.

This group of rickshaw pullers, this group of poor and helpless compatriots, should receive the support and assistance of all sectors of society in upholding justice and showing compassion!

### Salis Arrives in Hong Kong from Shantou Testimony Says Incident Involving the New Heimun is Inaccurate The Ship is Currently Remaining in Xiamen and Can Return to Hong Kong This Week

Yesterday, there were widespread rumors in Hong Kong that more than 270 overseas Chinese from Nanyang, who had returned to their country on the De Jili Shi Company's New Heimun ship from Yangon, were intercepted by two × submarines on the 14th of the month off the coast of Shantou, forced to stop sailing, and then a large number of × soldiers boarded the ship and detained the passengers. More than 200 overseas Chinese from Guangdong were killed, while more than 60 overseas Chinese from Fujian were fortunate to be unharmed. It was also said that a Westerner, the owner of the New Heimun, was electrocuted. Since the news spread, people in Hong Kong have been quite concerned. In recent days, people have visited the De Jili Shi Company, and all said that they had not received this news. Yesterday (30th) morning at 10:00, the company's Salis ship arrived in Hong Kong. According to a senior official of the ship, this ship also heard the rumor of the New Heimun's misfortune during the voyage. One day, when the ship arrived in Xiamen, the New Heimun also arrived. They inquired about each other and learned that the claim of the ship's misfortune was not true. Strangely, the New Heimun also received news during the voyage that this ship (Salis) had been in an accident. The circumstances of the reported accident were exactly the same. In fact, both ships were safe. The New Heimun is expected to return to Hong Kong within the week. As for the rumors circulating outside, they are groundless and no one knows where they came from.

### Completing a Meaningful Work! The Youth Association Joint Performance Opened Last Night Mr. Cai Chusheng Attended the Lecture and Offered Encouragement A Performance Review Meeting Will Be Held This Saturday

(Special Report from This Newspaper) The situation of the first night of the joint performance by the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association at South China Middle School was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It was found that the most popular performances on the second night were the "Sanjiang Hao" by the Xuezhen Drama Society and the "Chinese Daughter" by the Guangdong Drama Association's Hong Kong compatriots. Last night was the third and final night, and the venue was still full. The "Spring Smile" performed by the Ren Dou Drama Society, the "After the Fall" performed in Mandarin by the China Bookstore Drama Society, and the "Seeking Survival from Death" performed by the Bow Drama Society were all very wonderful and moving.

The ironclad facts prove the great role of drama and singing. In order to carry out collective self-education, the association plans to hold a review meeting of this performance at South China Middle School at 7:00 PM this Saturday.

### Hong Kong Has Become the General Hub of Domestic and International Postal Transportation Foreign Mail Will No Longer Be Transferred Through Shanghai to Prevent × Inspection Central China and North China Will Be Transferred Through Fujian to the Southwest, and Shantou and Vietnam

(Special Report from This Newspaper) Mail from overseas countries to various parts of North and Central China was mostly transshipped through Shanghai before the war. However, since the outbreak of the war, Shanghai has been occupied by × forces, and the mailing of mail has been greatly hindered. Moreover, × people have set up so-called "inspectors" in Shanghai, and all incoming and outgoing mail is subject to illegal inspection. Therefore, mailing letters from abroad to China via Shanghai is not only delayed, but also subject to accidental loss due to the × people's abuse of inspection. The General Directorate of Posts of the Ministry of Communications of China recognized that this had to be improved. Therefore, it was decided that all mail between China and foreign countries would no longer be transshipped through Shanghai, but would be concentrated in Hong Kong. Therefore, Hong Kong has now become the general hub of domestic and international postal transportation. All mail from overseas to China will be transshipped through Hong Kong. As for the entry points, they have also been designated. Mail to North and Central China will enter through Fuzhou, Fujian Province, and will be attributed to Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi Provinces. Mail to the Southwest will be entered through Shantou and Annam (Vietnam) and Burma. This method has recently been notified by the General Directorate of Posts to the postal administrations of various countries for compliance. After implementation, all domestic and foreign postal transportation will not pass through Shanghai, which will not only avoid × inspection, but also eliminate any obstacles in the future. (Ju Ren)

### Legislative Council Meeting Tomorrow Will Amend the Rules to Strictly Prohibit Landlords from Forcibly Evicting Tenants If Landlords Forcibly Evict or Attempt to Forcibly Evict Tenants Can Sue for Compensation in Civil Court

The Hong Kong Legislative Council will hold a meeting at 2:30 PM this Thursday afternoon. The most important item on the agenda is the first reading by Attorney General Yan Libo of the 1938 Amendment to the Ordinance on Preventing the Eviction of Tenants. If this case is passed, the right of re-occupation enjoyed by landlords under common law will be suspended during the validity of the original ordinance. Before the tenant moves out, if the landlord implements re-occupation or intends to re-occupy, the tenant may sue for compensation. According to the amended rules, the court is authorized to decide on rent disputes in order to seek fairness in the rent amount. In addition, before a judge or clerk issues a seizure warrant in accordance with the 1883 Rent Arrears Seizure Ordinance, the applicant must provide evidence to prove that the tenant refuses to pay rent or that the rent increase is excessive. According to this new ordinance, landlords may not arbitrarily force eviction or arbitrarily raise rents, and cunning landlords who refuse to collect rent on purpose, claiming that the tenant owes rent, and request the court to issue a seizure warrant to take back the building, will not be able to sell their tricks. The other items on the agenda are: (1) Unofficial member Pu Lejue Shen questions whether the Hong Kong government has made a statement on the financial situation of Tung Wah Hospital and its affiliated hospitals; (2) Secretary of Administration requests the passage of the Financial Meeting Report No. 11 of December 22, 1938; (3) Attorney General Yan Libo requests the passage of the regulations made by the Attorney General on the 12th of this month in accordance with Article 32 of the Higher Court Ordinance, Ordinance No. 3 of 1873; (4) Attorney General Yan Libo requests: (1) First reading of (A) the Amendment to the 1935 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, (B) the repeal of the 1934 Governor's Office and Hong Kong District Expansion Plan Ordinance, and the allocation of the surplus amount under the account set up in the Finance Department in accordance with Article 4 of the Ordinance to general revenue, (C) the aforementioned Amendment to the 1938 Ordinance on Preventing the Eviction of Tenants, (D) the Amendment to the 1889 Evidence Ordinance, (E) the Amendment to Article 45 of the 1938 Amended Rules of the 1865 Ordinance on Assaulting Others; (2) Second and Third readings of (A) the Further Amendment to the 1915 Asian Immigration Ordinance, (B) the Amendment to the 1899 Criminal Procedure Ordinance.

### Anti-Japanese East River Captain Arrives in Hong Kong to Raise Funds Hopes That Overseas Chinese Will Actively Sponsor

The Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team was established in the winter of the 26th year. Since the outbreak of the South China War, the work of the team has become active, and it has been divided into three district teams: east, west, and north. After the fall of Guangzhou, the East River District Team traveled to various places in the west and north of the two rivers, walking to the Dongjiang River, Heyuan, Huiyang, and Boluo areas to participate in political training for local civil defense groups and guerrilla teams, mobilize the people, and provide military service and rescue work. Now, in order to promote various tasks, the team has specially dispatched Captain Tan Jiaju and team members Chen Qiaozhen and Li Jiazhen to Hong Kong to raise donations and medicines. Mr. Tan and others have been contacting various parties in recent days and have made considerable progress. It is hoped that the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong will actively sponsor the team.

### Chinese Ancient Book Pre-Exhibition

— Yu Lang

Daytime Exhibition in England Promotes Chinese History and Art

The exhibition of famous paintings from various dynasties of our country, which are to be transported to London, was pre-exhibited yesterday (30th) by the "Hong Kong Art Research Association" in the conference room of the South China Morning Post.

Perhaps because the place was too small, only twenty-seven pieces were exhibited. Although the quantity is said to be small, the quality is extremely rich. Only the old saying "a feast for the eyes, a beauty that surpasses all" can describe this painting exhibition.

Upon entering, there is the well-known large ink painting "Entering Cloud Dragon" by Chen Suoweng of the Song Dynasty. The ink is used to create clouds, which are changing and realistic, and extremely lovely. The ink dragon, which "sees its head but not its tail," is also very agile, and it is indeed a flawless masterpiece.

The four large figure sketches of ploughing, weeding, gathering firewood, and fishing by Zhan Zidu of the Sui Dynasty are skillfully executed, and the lines are vigorous. "Autumn Mountain Gathering Firewood" and "Standing Fishing" are even more charming.

In the center is a green pavilion landscape "Datong Hall" by Li Sixun of the Tang Dynasty. The picture is particularly large, with carved beams and painted rafters, winding railings and small pavilions, and the high pavilions of the main hall are detailed but not rigid. The author's魄力 is truly not small.

Li also has a "Autumn Mountain Journey Map", also a green landscape, depicting more than thirty horses and more than twenty people. Each horse and each person has a different posture—on the rugged mountain path, some are leading horses, some are watering horses, and some are riding horses over small bridges. In the middle of the mountain, there is a small tea pavilion, where eight or nine old wild mountain people are drinking tea, each with a different expression, which is very interesting. The horses resting outside the pavilion are either lying down or standing. Without a "spirit-transmitting brush," such a good picture could not be written. Su Hanchen—a man of the Five Dynasties—painted "Dragon Girl Picture," which is resplendent and meticulously rich.

The landscape painting of the Song Dynasty Mi Fu, "Imperial City in the Clouds, Ten Thousand Homes with Spring Trees in the Rain," can be said to be the most outstanding work in the entire exhibition. Mi Fu's landscape is a unique school, with皴法, dots, tree methods... all having unique styles. The painting of stones is even more extraordinary. It is indeed "uncommon." Although the landscapes of the Tang Dynasty are beautiful, they lack the majestic vigor of the Song Dynasty landscapes and the清逸 of the Yuan Dynasty landscapes. That's why I say that Mi Fu's landscape and Xia Gui's landscape of the Song Dynasty, Huang Gongwang's "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains" of the Yuan Dynasty, and Wu Zhen's "Four Seasons Picture" landscape of the Yuan Dynasty are better by two筹.

Li Guizhen's "Five Ethics Picture" of the Song Dynasty has the imperial inscription of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, the originator of calligraphy and painting. Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty was a painter, and his appreciation of works must be more valuable than the imperial inscriptions of other emperors. In the picture, a pair of桐花風 is very meticulous and agile.

Many modern people write peacocks with meticulousness and gorgeousness, but unfortunately, nineteen out of ten lose their rigidity. Here, there is a flower and bird painting by Diao Guangyin of the Tang Dynasty, depicting a pair of peacocks, lively and eager to live, which are rare works.

There are many other works such as album pages and horizontal scrolls. Based on the reporter's personal memory, "hanging one and missing ten thousand" is inevitable. In short, from these twenty-odd works, one can already see the greatness of ancient Chinese art.

Art is a sharp weapon to connect human sympathy. Let our great ancient art go abroad so that friendly countries can have a more accurate understanding of us!

### Old Nickel Coins to be Abolished After the Lunar New Year; Authorities Hope Merchants Will Exchange as Much as Possible Before the End of the Year

The Hong Kong authorities have issued new nickel coins in the denominations of one亳 and five仙 in order to unify auxiliary coins and prevent criminals from counterfeiting and disrupting finance. The issuance of the new nickel coins is about to reach one year. Due to various reasons, the old coins have not yet been fully recovered. Mr. 布力氏, the Director of Temple Affairs, told reporters yesterday that the authorities originally planned to announce a deadline for the withdrawal of old coins at the end of the lunar year. Within a certain period after the announcement, they would be declared invalid and no longer in circulation. However, because the year-end is approaching, the market needs more auxiliary coins in circulation. If an announcement is issued at this time, citizens will rush to exchange them, which may cause some disturbance to order. It has now been decided to issue the announcement a few days after the New Year. It is hoped that merchants will exchange as much as possible within this year so that the government's future withdrawal of old coins will be easier to handle. The first batch of new coins issued for circulation in the market, including one亳 and five仙 denominations, totaled about three million yuan. The second batch issued also totaled about three million yuan. Currently, the total in circulation in the market is six million yuan, and the Treasury Department has a large number of new coins in stock, which are prepared to be fully issued within the lunar year.

### After the Fall of Qingdao, Foreign Businesses Greatly Affected; Import and Export Trade Has Virtually Ceased; Jiaodong Area Constantly Attacked by Us

[Shanghai Correspondence] According to the North China Daily News, Qingdao, an important port in Shandong Province, is a beautiful summer resort, and in addition to being a year-round ice-free naval base, superior to Yantai and Dalian, it is also an export port for Shandong products such as tobacco, silk, cotton, and coal. In terms of waterways, it is very close to Shanghai, and by land, the Jiaoji Railway connects the Longhai and Beining Railways, connecting prosperous areas of North-South products. Before the outbreak of the current war, there were less than 1,500 Japanese people in Qingdao. Now, Japanese merchants from Japan and Northeast China have poured in, reaching 25,000 people. Foreign trade in Qingdao is now being ostracized due to the arbitrary suppression by the Japanese side. Foreign importers are restricted in exchange rates and shipping, and are forced to stop doing business. This restriction is implemented by the Japanese Army and Navy Headquarters and is unreasonably self-evident. Foreign importers who had transactions with large and small commercial firms in our country before the war are now greatly affected, and therefore, many of these commercial firms have closed down or have been forcibly occupied by the Japanese side. Once it falls into the hands of the Japanese, foreign raw materials are no longer needed. Therefore, foreign importers have to close their Qingdao offices. Foreign ships sailing in the sea and along the coast are also subject to strict restrictions and cannot freely use the docks, but can only anchor on the sea. However, ships owned by the Japanese can freely use all dock facilities and断驳 transport. Although the驳 transport fee is carried out by Japanese ships, their service is extremely unreliable. Therefore, ships are subject to various difficulties after sailing to Qingdao and suffer completely unnecessary losses. The import and export trade of foreign firms has virtually ceased. Only foreign tobacco is still operating, and the impact on it is not as great as on ordinary foreign firms. The Japanese are麻醉ing the daily life of the Chinese people, which is evident everywhere, such as the five-color flag and the Japanese flag hanging crisscross, and photos of the Japanese army and friendly traitors. Every few days, the Japanese authorities order the puppet maintenance association to致愚the people and teach them to shout slogans. Recently, there was a so-called anti-communist parade, carrying absurd books, guided by a band, and setting off firecrackers along the way, which was extremely ugly. Some members of the anti-communist association, some White Russians, participated in the parade. These White Russians were organized into an anti-communist association by the Japanese side, and everything they said and did followed their主仑, that is, the Japanese military authorities. The Japanese military authorities even ordered White Russian children not to enter foreign schools in Qingdao, such as British schools, because the Japanese side said that the training and education in these schools did not conform to the ideals of the Japanese side. Therefore, all White Russian children returned to White Russian schools. All public conveniences and services such as telephone, electricity, power,自水, and public buses are completely in the hands of the Japanese. All dock operations such as驳 transport are monopolized by the Japanese under the protection of the Japanese Navy and Marine Corps. Industries, flour mills, iron mines, and iron factories are all taken over by capitalists of large Japanese firms. It is undoubtedly certain that a small number of factories still operated by Chinese people will soon be taken over by the Japanese. In short, every kind of profitable trade in Shandong has either been taken over by the Japanese or is in the process of being taken over, and foreign businesses,无论如何, will be forced to be driven out. Coastal shipping of foreign companies is decreasing, and because there are few export goods, very few sea ships sail to Qingdao. However, Japanese ships are sailing frequently, and various Japanese goods are continuously输人, and most of them藉口 military supplies without paying tariffs, so foreign firms cannot compete with them. All properties of our government and administrative personnel have been confiscated as properties of the Japanese Navy and Marine Corps. Wealthy residents have all fled to other places. As the number of Japanese people has increased, Japanese tea rooms, hotels, liquor stores, and department stores have also opened one after another. Large buildings and schools that once belonged to Chinese people are now stationed by the Japanese army. There are few conflicts between foreigners and the Japanese army because Qingdao has no concession, so the Japanese army is not very tense about the feelings of foreigners. The Jiaoji Railway connecting Qingdao and Jinan is still the target of constant attacks by our guerrillas. These guerrillas, it is said, are commanded by the former Qingdao mayor Shen Honglie. Every night, they attack the railway line, and any negligence by the Japanese army will cause the train to derail. In addition, along the coast of Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Yantai, several Japanese soldiers are inevitably ambushed and killed or injured by guerrillas every day. In short, Qingdao is of great value, both militarily and economically, and the Japanese army will not be willing to give it up once they get it.

### Travelogue of Xiang and Gui (Continued)

— Shuai Liangcang

Otherwise, it would be said that without a strong northerly wind, it would take a "天拋天" (Note 2) to arrive. I had long admired the scenery of Hengyang, so on the afternoon of the fourth day, when the ship arrived at Zhuting, I landed and transferred to the Yuehan train first. After staying for a few days, I was able to make a tour of Hengyang, the leading big city in Hunan Province. My impressions are described below:

A Glimpse of the City—The city of Hengyang is divided into inner and outer cities. According to the county chronicles, "The inner city is two丈 five尺 high, one丈 six尺 thick, and has a circumference of one thousand two hundred and seventy-eight尺. The outer city is more than one丈 high. The city walls still exist today. There are seven gates in the city, namely Binri in the east, also called Ran. Hui in the south. Xi'an in the west. Dan in the north. Gejiang in the southeast, also called Tie. Xiaoxiang in the northeast. And Wanghu in the northwest. The scale of the roads and the prosperity of the businesses within the city are not inferior to the central area of Nanchang. Especially Nanzheng Street and Xizheng Street are the city's最. Recently, due to the opening of the Xiang-Gui Railway, the number of passengers has been increasing day by day, and inns have sprung up in the通街巷, like bamboo shoots after the rain. But when I arrived in Hengyang and got off the train, I ran into more than a dozen inns after entering the city before I finally found a room in the Xiang-Gui Restaurant near the Silver Flower Cinema. Most of the inns in Hengyang are called restaurants. The best-equipped is the Guangdong Restaurant.

Turning from Xizheng Street to the crossroads of Nanzheng Street, a transparent electric light illuminates the advertisement for "Beautiful Girl Hairdressing." It turns out that there are many barber shops in that area. Generally, the barbers are beautiful girls of eighteen or nineteen. Their soft hands are slender, and the sound of scissors is铮铮. It attracts young men in suits. Whenever they pass by the door, they naturally raise their hands and touch their heads, silently asking themselves, "Has it grown yet?"

As the sun sets and the lights come on, the two giant mouths in front of Silver Flower and Shengping Cinema devour crowds of young men and women, and then slowly spit them out after two or three hours. It turns out that they are showing anti-war movies. When they come out, each young man's face is露出ing a state of excitement and indignation. Hengyang is roaring.

Scenery Points—Hengyang is named because it is located on the yang side of Heng Mountain. According to the book, the peaks of Nan Yue span the two borders of Changsha and Hengyang, with Huiyan at the head and麓 at the foot. With a long history, there are naturally many scenic spots. The county has eight scenic spots:

(1) Yan Peak in Misty Rain, outside the Huiyan Gate, with the Misty Rain Pool below.

(2) Flower Medicine Spring Creek, about three 里 east of the west bus station.

(3) East Isle Peach Waves, about three 里 south of the east bus station. There is the Chuanshan Temple on the isle, built by Peng Yulin of the Qing Dynasty to commemorate Wang Chuanshan.

(4) Prison Pavilion Snow, outside the west斗.

(5) Stone Drum Landscape, outside the north gate, with Zhu 菴's inscription saying "A good place in the郡."

(6) Zhu Ling Back Cave, behind Stone Drum Mountain, where Dong Fengxian of the Tang Dynasty practiced the Hua Dan method.

(7) Green Grass Fisherman's Home, outside the north gate. Whenever the setting sun is on the mountain and the fishing boats sing in the evening, it is truly a beautiful景.

(8) West Lake Lotus, outside the small west gate, with the Ai Lian Pavilion, where Zhou Dunyi of the Song Dynasty studied.

A Beautiful Woman's Soul Leaving Her Body—Almost everyone who has read the Taiping Guangji knows about the story of a beautiful woman's soul leaving her body. The story goes like this: "During the Tang Dynasty, there was a man named Zhang 　, who lived in Heng 　. He promised his beloved daughter, Qian Niang, to his nephew Yu Zhou. But in the middle, there was someone who expressed affection for her字. Qian heard郁 and was depressed. Zhou was慨. He claimed to be going to the capital and bought a boat and left suddenly. He could not sleep on the boat at night. Qian Niang suddenly came to the cabin. After meeting, they decided to elope. They lived in Sichuan for five years and had two sons. Later, they returned to Hengzhou. Zhou携 his wife and children to Zhang to apologize. He was surprised to find that Qian Niang had not left闽阁 and was lying ill in bed. When the two women met, they immediately became one."

During my stay in Xiang-Gui, I often chatted with the tea博士 after dinner and tea. According to the博士, it was indeed a fact. Now, the Jiudu Shop outside the north gate is the place where the soul met. Three county lives.

After staying in Hengyang for a few days, the weather suddenly turned cold. I knew that this was the northerly wind weather. Sure enough, one afternoon, the sails of my companion's ship appeared one by one at the Qingcao Bridge under the Stone Drum Pillar. So, I landed the next day and hired porters and vehicles,winding地绕着迴雁峯　to the Hengyang West Station of the Xiang-Gui Railway. (There are now buses from the city to the station, with a fare of two角 per person.) At that time, the road was only open to the whole county. We had decided to come to Gui, so we temporarily made the terminal our destination. We set off at six o'clock in the evening, and after listening to the rumbling of the train all night, when the east gradually turned white, we had passed Dong'an and slowly said goodbye to Hunan. It turned out that the end of the road in Hunan was Miaotou Station, and the beginning of Guangxi was Huangsha River. The whole road was full of stone mountains and forests, which were extremely steep, which was enough to make people feel refreshed. The mountains and rivers of Guilin are said to be the best in the world, which is indeed true.

### Philippine Inter-City Football Team to Arrive in Hong Kong on the 14th, Hong Kong Football Association Ramping Up Preparations

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Time flies like a white horse passing a crack, and the Spring Festival is approaching. The inaugural Hong Kong-Philippines inter-city football match is scheduled to take place when spring returns and flowers blossom. Counting down the days, the auspicious date is near, and football fans are secretly delighted.

Currently, the Football Association is ramping up preparations, putting in a great deal of effort. On one hand, they are rushing to select the Hong Kong team representatives in the near future to hold practice matches. On the other hand, they are planning advance ticket sales, following the past practice of the Hong Kong-Shanghai inter-city match, distributing them to various affiliated associations and major companies for advance sales.

A few days ago, the Football Association received a letter from the Philippines stating that the team and entourage are scheduled to depart on the 14th of this month and arrive in Hong Kong on the 16th.

The level of football skill in the Philippines before the war was quite low. However, physical strength is the only strength of football players there.

Since the arrival of Shanghai's famous player Poselli (French forward) in the Philippines before the war, he has made many contributions to the local football scene, thereby gradually improving the skill level of various teams.

This time, the Philippine team's visit to Hong Kong is sure to give the island's fans a fresh perspective.

### Jianquan Table Tennis Tournament to Be Held Soon

The Jianquan Taijiquan Office will hold the Quan Jianhang Table Tennis Tournament. A total of 36 teams have registered. However, because there are fewer women's teams this year, the office may consider holding the women's finals during the men's finals. As for the opening date, the association originally scheduled it to be held in the near future. However, due to the compilation of the order sheets, which has not yet been printed, it has now been decided that the tournament will begin before the 15th of this month, as soon as the order of each team has been completed. Regarding the location of the competition, the Kong Sheng Association Table Tennis Hall, the Kowloon YMCA, the Guanghua Association, the Oriental Sports Association, the Government Chinese Staff Association Zhencheng Association, and the above locations have been designated.

### Huang Jiliang to Play Basketball Again, Will Join the Star Team

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Huang Jiliang, who has been a leader in the sports world for many years, returned from Java a month ago and has rarely been active in the sports community. He was originally an expert in football, basketball, and swimming. In recent years, he has devoted himself to business, and has gradually given them up. Yesterday, a reporter met him at the South China Billiards Room. He said that playing basketball is still interesting, but he will not participate in the league. He can play in friendly matches and charity matches. Therefore, the reporter introduced him to join the Star Team and has asked Brother Chizi to notify Brother Sang Yu to register his name. When the Washington team comes to Hong Kong to compete, perhaps we can see his good skills again. (Tai Sui)

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment... Utterly Silly

Beau Hunks

This is a work by Laurel and Hardy from several years ago. Now, a new copy has been re-released. Among all of Laurel and Hardy's works, this one is slightly weaker. The film is not very long, and the content is not very rich. In the film, Hardy is frustrated and heartbroken, so he enlists in the army and is sent to Africa. During a Saharan march, the two get lost but end up saving a besieged city from the natives. Laurel and Hardy maintain their consistent style, and the jokes are still enough to make the audience laugh.

Finally... Death Ray Explosion Machine

Arrest of Bulldog Drummond

There have been several films about the detective Bulldog Drummond before, but each has an independent story. In this film, "Death Ray Explosion Machine," apart from HE Warner replacing John Barrymore, the other actors have not changed much. Among all the Bulldog Drummond detective films, this one has a more tortuous and thrilling story. The story depicts Drummond, on the eve of his wedding, again having to deal with the murder of his friend, a professor who is an inventor and is working on the invention of a death ray explosion machine. Drummond is eager to avenge his friend and, because it concerns national defense, he strives to track down the enemy, going through many dangers and eventually bringing the villains to justice.

The whole film is tense and lively. John Howard plays the detective and acts vigorously. The acting skills of the other actors are also unique.

Peace... The Story of a Young Widow

That Certain Woman

This is a work in which Bette Davis and Henry Fonda collaborate again after "That Certain Woman." This is the second time this film has been released in Hong Kong.

The story tells of a sad marriage. Bette plays a working widow who falls in love with a man, but because the man's father strongly opposes it, the marriage does not take place. However, she is unfortunately pregnant and soon gives birth to a child. Later, the man marries another woman in Paris. Then, that woman injures her leg and becomes disabled. At the same time, out of sympathy for her husband and the child he had with the widow, she sacrifices her love and allows them to reunite.

The tragic atmosphere of the whole film is quite strong, and several climaxes are very effective in manipulating the audience's emotions. Bette Davis plays a widow who is heavily oppressed by the social environment, giving a deep and moving performance. Henry Fonda is also very competent.

Oriental... Mother and Son's True Feelings

Of Human Hearts

This describes the tragedy of a family. The father is a missionary who sacrifices everything for religion, but his son opposes this work, thinking that being a doctor is more practical than being a pastor. So, after a fierce argument, the son leaves home to study medicine. Later, the old father dies, and the mother sacrifices everything to raise education funds for her son. By the time he finishes his studies, the civil war has broken out. Rescue work makes him feel very interested. Because he felt that the family had left him with a bad influence, he forgot his old mother. It was not until someone criticized him that he felt ashamed and returned to his mother's arms.

The tragic components of the whole film are very strong. At the same time, although this film is not a war film, the war and rescue scenes are quite impressive. Several of the main actors seem a little unfamiliar to us, but their performances do not disappoint.

Great China... Skillful Girl's Singing

Mad About Music

This is a very moving tragicomedy. Because some places need to be made into a comedy, they inevitably seem a little weak. Of course, this does not affect the film itself. The director's handling is quite tight, and every development can capture the humor of the comedy.

Deanna Durbin's performance is extremely beautiful. Not only are the several songs extremely pleasant to listen to, but her expressions are also excellent. Several supporting roles are also very perfect.

New World... Women's World

Cantonese film

The plot describes the story of a group of female boarders in a women's apartment. This apartment contains all kinds of people. They have their own professions, but they are extremely complicated. Among them are female students, female reporters, female salespeople, singers, dancers... etc. All the working women in the city are included here. The women are buzzing around, and they each have their own experiences. It is no exaggeration to say that she is a microcosm of women in the city. However, the progress of the plot of the whole play seems very lax and forced because there is no male foil, which cannot arouse the audience's interest. At the same time, this film can only depict the ordinary private lives of ordinary women, such as applying powder and arguing. However, it has never been able to write about the broad descriptions of women. This is really the only reason for the film's failure. In the end, the women all realized what was going on and united to go to the front line because the apartment was bombed. This also seems unnatural and formulaic. However, having said that, we must also forgive the writers and directors. It is also a very difficult thing to perform a play with all women.

Central... Sequel to Golden Chrysanthemum

Cantonese film

Audiences who have seen the previous episode will always remember that at the end, Zhou Zhicheng still stole a pair of Golden Chrysanthemums. The sequel starts with this incident and continues until the Golden Chrysanthemums are returned. The plot is not as tense and tortuous as the previous episode, and the performance is also very lax. However, there are still many places in the middle that can win the tears of some stupid audiences, such as the persecution and imprisonment of Kuang Shanxiao and Xiao Yanfei's prison visits. The consistent style of folk tales cannot be avoided. We don't need to watch it to guess the plot of the film. Sure enough, the move is not crafted. Cao Tongwen is not suitable for acting in this type of film. The set photography is still passable in South China, but Mu Yin's is a failure.

Taiping... Cantonese Opera

Taiping Male and Female Troupe

Day performance... Wild Dragon

Night performance... Three Acts of Yin and Yang Hall

Puqing... Cantonese

Xing Zhonghua Troupe

Day performance... Suspended

Night performance... Three Unfortunate Grandsons

### Looking Back and Ahead

— 【Lai Duanfu】

The editor of this column, Mr. Chen Yipan, said that my opinions on matters are always impartial, and he invited me to write weekly sports commentaries. Although I am busy, I dare not disobey my old friend's wishes. Therefore, I have decided to write "Looking Back and Ahead" every Wednesday.

After South China Southern defeated Eastern with a score of 2-1, those who hoped that the South China team would definitely win the championship all looked worried. This is because South China Southern has already lost one more point than the Navy in the league. However, I remain optimistic, because of South China Southern’s remaining seven games, only the Navy poses a significant threat. The Navy still faces many challenges, such as South China Southern, Eastern, South China China, and Middlesex, whom they have not yet met again. Once South China Southern regains its strength, they will likely sweep all before them. The Navy lacks scoring talent, and I fear they will not be able to win all six of their remaining games.

Last weekend, all the football teams with championship hopes seemed to encounter their nemesis. Not only did South China Southern suffer a setback, but according to news reports, the Shanghai Eastern team was defeated by the Western Police, ending their championship hopes. In the English First Division professional football league, the "Derby" team, which had the strongest championship hopes, was also defeated 3-0 by the mediocre "Stoke" team, losing one more point than the "Ipswich Town" team, which is currently in second place. Coincidentally, the situation is the same far and wide. South China Southern can take some comfort from this.

This week's Hong Kong football matches are at a crucial juncture for both the Special Silver Shield and the league. South China Southern's rematch against Kowloon Club and South China China's rematch against Eastern in the First Division Special Silver Shield will undoubtedly be the most attention-grabbing scenes on Saturday and Sunday. At the same time, South China's match against the Five Camps Artillery in the Second Division league at the Garrison Ground on Saturday is also a crucial scene in the Second Division. Currently, South China Club, Middlesex, Garrison Artillery, and Scots are considered the four strongest teams in the Second Division, with the others having lost hope of winning the championship. The situation of the four strongest teams is as follows:

Team Name  Games Played  Wins  Draws  Losses  Goals For  Goals Against  Points

South China Club  16  13  2  1  46  19  28

Five Camps Artillery 15  11  3  1  45  18  25

Middlesex  16  12  1  3  70  26  25

Scots  16  12  1  3  5  16  25

Looking at the table above, if South China wins this weekend, they will be five points ahead of the other three teams, and their championship will be secure. If they unfortunately lose, they will face a great threat from the Artillery, because although they will still be in first place on the surface, they will have actually lost one more point than the Artillery. Examining the South China team in the Third Division, although they can still compete for second place, they have lost hope of winning the championship. I hope the South China coach will prioritize the Second Division team and continue to use Li Enpei, the center forward from the Third Division, as the center forward for the Second Division team this weekend. From my observation, this player will definitely become a good player in the First Division in the future.

In the rematch of the Special Silver Shield, South China Southern will play Kowloon Club at Jiashan. Without home advantage, Kowloon Club is not a strong team, and South China will likely win. However, one should not be careless in everything. If Li Tiansheng's foot injury has not healed by then, Li Guowei should still be used as the left inside forward, and Cong Yanzan should replace Guowei in the midfield line. It would be best to invite Li Huitang to assist in the forward line. This will not only greatly increase the attacking power but also allow the "ball freak" to practice his shooting skills in preparation for the inter-port matches. Mr. Li has always been concerned about his mother club, sharing its joys and sorrows, and I believe he will definitely come if invited. In South China China's rematch against Eastern, both teams are Chinese teams, and it is gratifying regardless of who wins. However, both teams should show their full strength during the match and demonstrate true sportsmanship. If Zhang Manrong's foot injury has healed, it seems appropriate to replace Li Shuoyou with him. What we hope for even more is that all misunderstandings should be dispelled during the match, and we do not want to see any recurrence of the incidents from the first match. If Lin Depu's injury has not healed, then the best formation for South China China would be as follows:

Tan Junqian

Liu Mao Liu Weipei

Xie Jinhong You Huaxing Liang Baiwei

Zhang Manrong Liu Songsheng Chen Dehui Li Enliang Yang Shuiyi

It is said that this year's Hong Kong sports have reached the highest level in Hong Kong's history, mainly because of the gathering of talents. I say, not necessarily. However, the football goalkeepers have truly become unprecedentedly good. There are famous Chinese goalkeepers gathered in Hong Kong, including Bao Jiaping, Tan Junqian, Zhang Rongcai, Huang Jiliang, Zhou Xianyan, and Liu Xianhan, Zhu Zhaoheng, and Li Guoqi, who have risen rapidly. There are also Xu Heng, Chen Qisong, Xiao Dianlian, Yi Zanbang, and Chen Xipei, who were once well-known. There is also Zhang Manrong, who is famous in the small-field football world. If these people were organized, they could form a purely goalkeeper football team, and their strength would not be weak. There is also an unprecedentedly happy event, which is that we reporters and weak scholars can also actively research the path of sports and actually establish a well-organized sports special committee.

The students' tennis skills on the isolated island have improved rapidly, and they can actually form a team to compete in Hong Kong, which is also a gratifying thing. Yesterday, I met a famous tennis player who said that two players on the team have very good skills. Tang Baodao recently defeated Jiang Daozhang, a veteran who has represented China in the Davis Cup, 6-3 in practice. Judging from this, the team seems to have a good chance of winning or drawing in their matches against the University of Hong Kong and South China Club. I very much hope that one or two geniuses like Xu Chengji can emerge from this.

### About Mr. Zhu Peixian

— Chunfeng

Unintentionally, yesterday (28th) I saw an article signed "Peixian" in the editorial column of a certain newspaper in Hong Kong, titled "Hesitation and Rumors." Because I know that Mr. Zhu has never liked to talk about politics, let alone write political commentary, and he is a very enthusiastic supporter of the War of Resistance, he would never make such ignorant and absurd remarks as "so-called long-term pain is worse than short-term pain, the people can endure temporary sacrifices in exchange for long-term peace. Unexpectedly, the government has been defeated but does not admit defeat, can make peace but does not talk about peace, not only does not talk about peace, but also oppresses the leaders who advocate peace..." Therefore, there must be some mystery here. This "Peixian" is definitely not Zhu Peixian, who is currently the director of Chinese Literature at Southwest Associated University in Yunnan, but must be a villain fabricating or impersonating. There is no doubt about that.

Today, in this unprecedented great and transformative era, those who were once patriotic gentlemen can suddenly turn into great villains who steal national power and lose their personality. People and ghosts are changing rapidly. But there are indeed some steadfast, fearless, unwavering, and unchangeable virtuous people, and Mr. Peixian is one of them. Therefore, it is definitely necessary to clarify the situation.

Peixian is the courtesy name of Mr. Zhu Ziqing. Decades ago, he became famous in the literary world with his book "Back View." He is good at writing essays, and his prose is the most beautiful. Since parting ways in the ancient city, I have never seen his works again. Some time ago, I read an article by him in "Today's Commentary" titled "New Language," which was the first time I had read his writing since the War of Resistance.

He is probably a well-known teacher among young students. His prose often appears in textbooks. But he is also a senior and practical mentor. I remember that when the students in the ancient city were roaring four years ago, he fulfilled his guiding role. That year, the Suiyuan situation was urgent, and General Fu Zuoyi's great victory at Bailingmiao laid the foundation for the overall situation in the Northwest. Mr. Zhu represented Tsinghua University to comfort the Suiyuan soldiers at the front. In his report after returning from consoling the troops, his speech was full of fighting passion and national fervor. It made people clearly realize that although he is a courteous, elegant, and talented gentleman, he is also a vivid and powerful national warrior on the other hand.

I clearly remember that once at a meeting of the Tsinghua Chinese Literature Society, Mr. Liu Wendian, Mr. Wen Yiduo, and others talked about their experiences of inspecting the Northwest. They all had a burning flame of bright hope and foresaw that the Chinese nation's great anti-aggression struggle was about to begin. Mr. Wen said with a smile, "Look, the Chinese people's weapons are all stored in the Northwest! The Sino-Japanese war will break out soon." At that time, Mr. Zhu, Mr. Liu, and others felt satisfied and delighted that their footprints had been fortunate enough to reach Daqingshan before the great struggle.

In June of the year before last, Tsinghua University was still in a quiet atmosphere, continuing to study. I wanted to try to select or audit Mr. Zhu's classes, such as Du Shi, Song Poetry, and prose composition, but I could not do so because of scheduling conflicts. In early July, Mr. Zhu was still carefully planning my future after graduation. He repeatedly asked whether I would go to a certain middle school in Tianjin that he recommended, or to a certain school in Xiamen. But before I could answer, the ancient city had fallen into enemy hands. When I fled to Xiamen in a hurry, I later received a letter from him, knowing that he had also safely escaped from the occupied ancient city to Changsha. Before the Faculty of Arts of the Associated University moved to Kunming, I received a letter from him in Mengzi, saying that the location of the Associated University in Mengzi was very good and expressing reluctance about the future move to Kunming. He is indeed a poet with a beautiful mind, and also a good teacher who loves young people. When the Associated University moved from Changsha to Yunnan, Mr. Zhu was also a persevering and fearless walker who traveled thousands of miles on foot. His perseverance is indeed admirable.

Now, the peace fallacy that suddenly appeared in a certain newspaper in Hong Kong, although no reliable evidence has been obtained, we can first have such an assumption: that the author "Peixian" is not Mr. Zhu Ziqing. Based on Mr. Zhu's consistent attitude, he would never abandon himself to this point. Then, a certain newspaper's false claim of another person's name to fabricate treasonous remarks is indeed a serious crime that cannot be forgiven! (Editor's note: The Hong Kong traitorous newspapers often deliberately borrow the names of domestic writers to confuse the public. Recently, the newspapers of these traitors have also imitated this practice. We must expose this trick, and we hope readers will pay attention to it.)

### Unofficial Biographies of the Righteous People of Jiangyin

— Zou Xiao

Regarding this book ("Unofficial Biographies of the Righteous People of Jiangyin" 1 (written by Hu Shanyuan, a total of sixteen short stories, published by World Book Company, priced at four corners)), Yang Fei has already introduced it in the eighth issue of "Da Cha." Now I want to try to explore the techniques or art of this book.

The materials used by the author are all listed in the appendix, which allows us to compare them and understand the hard work the author has put in. The simpler ones seem to be "Jiangyin Houlu" by Ming Zhu Chunjia and "Huang Yuqi's Uprising in Zhutang" by Qing Ji Liuqi to write about "Huang Yuqi," and "Tianxiang Pavilion Notes" to write about "Hu Zhixue," "Xu Wu," and "Li Jiali." "Yuchu New Records" is used to write about "Qi Sanlang." The more laborious ones are from Qing Han's "Jiangyin City Defense Records," Qing Xu Chongxi's "Sequel to Jiangyin City Defense Records," and Qing Shen Tao's "Jiangshang Yiwen" to write about "Xu Yong," "The Ji Brothers," "Cheng Bi," "Wang Hua," "Old Man Tang," "Chen Xianqin," and "Xu Yuyang." The approximate focus is as follows: June 1st and 2nd (Xu Yong and the Ji Brothers), 15th (Cheng Bi), July 12th and 29th (Old Man Tang), 20th to 27th (Xu Yuyang), August 2nd (Wang Hua), 8th (Chen Xianqin). However, "Old Man Tang" and "Boy Tang" are not necessarily father and son. Combining them together is more interesting. This is a bold and clever point of the author, because novels are not exactly faithful history, and there is no need to be overly precise. The five-watch tune, surrender song, and reply song added in the "Xu Yong" chapter, although written by the author, are much more interesting than a simple mention.

The most complex are probably these three chapters: "Huang Mingjiang," "The He Brothers," and "Chen Erlang." The name Huang Mingjiang is derived from legends, so the names vary. "Jiangyin City Defense Records" and "Jiangshang Yiwen" write it as Huang Mingjiang, while "Sequel" and "Luqiao Records" write it as "Huang Yunjiang," and "Tianxiang Pavilion Notes" writes it as Wang Yungang, three completely different names. The author deliberated among them, weaving these five texts together, and making very interesting couplet-style dialogues, which took a lot of effort. The He Brothers are He Chang and He Tai. The author cleverly puts the "two brothers" from "Ming Ji Nan Lue" on the heads of the He brothers. "Chen Erlang" is based on "Anecdotes of the Ming and Qing Dynasties," but it cleverly organizes many anecdotes after the city's fall. The beginning quotes the section about people hiding in the Buddhist temple from "Oral Accounts of Refugees," and the middle section borrows Chen Erlang's tour to insert two tragic facts (the female corpse shadow and the naked women amidst arrows, both seen in Tianxiang Pavilion Notes), which is quite ingenious as if seen through Chen Erlang's eyes.

In my personal opinion, the following four chapters should be the highlights of the entire book: "Old Man Tang," "Chen Xianqin," "The He Brothers," and "Chen Erlang." On the one hand, the stories themselves are the most stimulating, and on the other hand, the author's skills are pure and refined. "Old Man Tang" is written as fiery as reading "Water Margin" or "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." In the ending of "Chen Xianqin," the author deliberately plays tricks. Although it is not explicitly stated who the assassin underwater is, the reader already knows that it is Chen Xianqin. Moreover, according to unofficial history, this assassin is not necessarily Chen Xianqin. The author's vague writing is恰好 consistent with unofficial history. "The He Brothers" almost entirely uses financial terms to compare the war against the Qing army, which is wonderfully unique and a rare good article. The nine-year-old "Chen Erlang" is also written as extremely cute, with the gestures and tone of a child, and Ali Da's ignorance of the pleasures between people is also portrayed in detail.

What is regrettable is that "Yan Dian Shi," this supporter of the Jiangyin City Defense, does not have a short story. Although he is a dian shi, he is still a righteous man of Jiangyin. The qualification of being a commoner should not be canceled just because he became an official. Moreover, he had already retired, and being a dian shi was only a promotion by the people. Also, there are no female resistance fighters; for example, Huang Yuqi's wife's repeated suicides are good material, but this is perhaps demanding perfection.

### Marching Jottings

— Li Huiying

"What are you saying? How could the commander-in-chief just eat yours for free?"

"Hehe."

"How much are you selling them for?"

"One corner for eight, commander-in-chief."

"It's easy to handle things once you have money." I looked at him and felt that this shop owner was too pitiful. Why are soldiers so feared to this extent? But upon closer reflection on our own past, I understood this cowering character. It is not right to easily blame them. I continued to ask, "You have so much stock, why don't you open your shop and sell it?"

"Hehe, commander-in-chief."

"Are you afraid that the commanders-in-chief won't pay?"

"Hehe, in the past, some commanders-in-chief ate and didn't..."

"Ate and didn't pay, is that right?"

He nodded.

"Have any troops passed through here recently?"

"Many have passed through."

"Did anyone buy your hemp flowers?"

"Of course," he gradually became more familiar with us, "quite a few ate them."

"Did they pay you?"

"They all bought them with cash."

"Were there any who didn't pay?"

"No, there weren't."

"Then why don't you open your shop for business?"

He smiled and then said with worldly wisdom:

"In these times, who dares to say who is a good person?"

"No wonder the entire street is closed, so that's the reason."

"Hehe, there's just no way around it, the common people are suffering."

"××××××××××."

"You know, ×××× are really bad. If they eat your hemp flowers, don't expect any money. Not only do they eat things without paying, but they also ×××××."

"Hehe, people say that ××× are civilized."

"In what way are they civilized?"

"When they buy things, they not only give money, but they also give extra."

"Is there anything else?"

"They often help the common people."

I looked at Wang, and Wang looked at me. This is a miracle. We haven't met such a person on the entire journey. It turns out that he must have been exposed to contrary propaganda from the traitors before this.

Can we blame him? No! Education is insufficient! Culture is backward! When I walked back to my lodgings, I deeply felt that our propaganda work was still not good enough. We must work harder in this area! (The End)

### New Attitudes of Guizhou Youth

— Wang Ping

Many people do not understand Guizhou. They think that the "Kamchatka" of Guizhou is still living under the haze of opium. In fact, Guizhou was indeed like this in the past. Moreover, the gentlemen who report on Guizhou often seize on Guizhou's weaknesses to write dispatches and features, which makes outsiders ignore or overlook Guizhou's progress.

Now, the clear facts are in front of the world. Guizhou is indeed shedding its old coat and putting on new clothes and new content in the flames of the War of Resistance. Look, the Guizhou Wartime Work Corps reported here is already the third group of organized Guizhou youth going to the battlefield.

They set off from Guizhou last November, crossing mountains and rivers, overcoming thousands of difficulties and hardships. They passed through many large and small cities, always taking advantage of the opportunity to work, even holding research meetings and discussions on the bus. In addition to doing general propaganda for the masses, their work is more importantly focused on propaganda for ethnic minorities such as the Miao, Yi, and Yao. Because several of them are Miao people who have already been assimilated by the Han Chinese, they are naturally very familiar with the customs, habits, languages, and personalities of the Miao and Yi. Therefore, they have compiled many Miao songs, Miao folk rhymes, and Miao stories... to promote "Small Dynasty invading Big Dynasty" (meaning Japan's invasion of China), to kill all the people in the "Big Dynasty," and to call on the Miao people to unite and drive out the "Small Dynasty" troops. At the same time, they also explain the Chinese government's implementation of benevolence to the Miao people... This is really very important work and work that has been overlooked in the past.

In addition, they also collect all the good customs and local political strengths to prepare for the construction of a new Guizhou.

There are a total of 103 of them. The leader is Mr. Chen Tilu, the executive committee member of the Guizhou Provincial Party Department, and there is also a political instructor.

Most of the members are middle school or elementary school teachers. Before going to the front line, they received three months of training. In order to achieve greater results in their work on the front line, they also practiced in many villages in Guizhou for two months before setting off. Therefore, in life, they are militarized; they carry their own luggage and cook their own meals; they are also popular with the people: they do not put on military airs. In terms of work, they have developed good planning and collectivity; in terms of learning, there are both group and collective methods. They also publish a "Wartime Work" three-day journal as a forum for practicing writing and expressing opinions.

Speaking of their treatment, it is really very limited. Each person receives twelve yuan per month, from the head of the delegation to the cooks. However, the operating expenses are very rich. In addition to the thousands of yuan donated automatically by all walks of life in the province, they are also subsidized by the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Anti-Japanese Association. In the future, they may be assigned to the command of General Wu Qihui of the Fourth Army, which will make the economic conditions more generous and the work more optimistic.

According to what this reporter knows, most of the members of the delegation were wealthy young masters and ladies in the past, or they had very strict party prejudices. But now, everyone has the noble, heroic determination and attitude of enduring hardship, eliminating prejudices, and going to war together.

The day before yesterday, they officially went to the front line of the northern section of the Yuehan Railway. In addition to their work, they also represent the people of all walks of life in Guizhou to comfort the heroic soldiers fighting against Japan!

### Snow Clouds

— Liu Lan

Snow·Blood

The snow was covered with patches of blood. Tonight, capturing last night's dream, I remembered this vividly.

Memory's hand reached further into the past, lifting the curtain of childhood: After the snow cleared, I went with my third uncle to the mountains to hunt wild rabbits. One shot hit, and bright red blood dripped onto the snow. That scene was no different from last night's dream.

Recalling these things, a wave of melancholy struck my heart like lightning. Ah, precious childhood, where did you flow?

Is my third uncle, who lives on the Guandong grasslands, still safe and sound? What is the fate of his hunting rifle? Has my third uncle used it to hunt enemies? The motherland has been shaken for more than a year. What about Guandong? Surely patriotic soldiers have gathered in the mountains?

It's snowing again. But the snow is no longer covered with the blood of wild rabbits, but with the blood of patriotic soldiers. Nourishing the frozen earth, in the spring, they will sprout flowers of freedom and victory.

Sea·Clouds

The sea roared, shattering the calm moon on the sea. It detests that obedient moon. The sea waves churned, the silver flowers shattered, as if they were about to surge into the seabed.

Clouds rushed from unknown distances, filling the sky, devouring the moon. The earth was pitch black, pressing down on the surging sea.

The night wind blew up the sorrow of the dark clouds, crying - the heavy rain came.

The sky tore apart the lightning. Gaps of light illuminated the mad sea. The waves seemed to want to destroy this world, and the earth shook.
