### On "Peace"

"Peace, peace, countless evils in the world are committed in your fair name."

Our nation's heroic resistance against Japan has now lasted for twenty months. The strength of the Japanese invaders is gradually weakening, and their crisis is becoming increasingly serious. Our nation's new strength is gradually growing and becoming stronger, and the prospect of victory is also gradually approaching. Yet, the clamor for "peace," "peace," continues to gather momentum and create thunderous noise. We, at this juncture, truly cannot and cannot bear to remain silent to allay the world's doubts.

The clamor for peace rising so clamorously at this time and in this place is due to nothing other than: first, the enemy's conspiracy and incitement; second, the traitors aiding and abetting the enemy; and third, the fantasies of some people. We can surely confront these three factors squarely and address them frankly, and then the dark clouds in our hearts will be swept away, and the path to life will reveal a glimmer of dawn. We will encourage each other with infinite excitement to seek freedom and happiness.

Why does the enemy incite "peace"? First, because of the failure of the enemy's military invasion of China. In the twenty months of war, they have indeed forcibly occupied many important cities and railway lines, but today the battle lines are becoming increasingly long, the military forces are becoming increasingly dispersed, and they feel increasingly inadequate. Not only is there no progress in all war zones, but also in the forcibly occupied areas, disturbances are rising, and defections by puppet troops are constantly occurring. Furthermore, rebellions within the army, navy, and air force, and anti-war mutinies, are becoming more and more frequent. That the enemy is on the verge of being unable to fight any longer is hardly a matter for the future. Second, because of the seriousness of the domestic crisis within the enemy country. Their economy and finances are on the verge of bankruptcy, the source of their huge military expenditure has dried up, and the livelihood of the people throughout the country is also facing desperation. Recently, anti-war sentiment, even under very strict surveillance and punishment, has evolved into actual action. The Communist Party's painstaking efforts to manage the People's Front are developing domestically and in Taiwan and Korea. Furthermore, the explosion and fire at the Osaka military arsenal, which began on February 28th and has not yet been extinguished, can serve as clear evidence. Third, because of the deterioration of their international position. Although only profit-seeking arms merchants of certain countries have recently begun to stop shipping arms to Japan, due to the Japanese side's inability to pay in cash and in view of the fact that China cannot be conquered. As for Japan's exclusive domination of the Pacific, it is an unchangeable national policy. The recent occupation of Hainan Island, the bombing of Hong Kong, and the seizure of concessions in Shanghai have further incurred the hatred of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Although the rulers of Britain and France are trying in many ways to compromise with Japan, this fundamental contradiction will continue to develop. Because of these two points, the Japanese invaders are eagerly using all sorts of clever words and poisonous schemes to lure international society and our compatriots, attempting to obtain a temporary armistice and peace talks, so that they can restore their vitality during the "peace" period, reorganize their armor, and plan new offensives. Given the strict organization of this newly emerging imperialist country, it is predicted that the "peace" will not last a year, and an unprecedented war will soon return. At that time, internal warfare in our country will revive, and the disaster of national subjugation will not require divination!

Why do traitors aid and abet the enemy by advocating "peace"? First, because the interests of the traitors are aligned with the enemy and opposed to the Chinese people. Resistance will surely lead to China's rise, while "peace" will surely lead to the victory of Japan. China's prosperity will lead to the execution of traitors, while Japan's victory will lead to the rewarding of traitors. Therefore, if traitors do not advocate peace talks, who will advocate peace talks? Second, because traitors are the hawks and dogs raised by Japan. If the hunter releases them, even if they kill their own kind and compatriots, how dare the hawks and dogs disobey? Therefore, Japan says "anti-communism, peace, pro-Japan," and the traitors and their newspapers and publications also dare not but loudly shout "anti-communism! Peace! Pro-Japan!" In short, if we regard the traitors as still being Chinese, we will feel that their words and actions are particularly shocking and suspicious, or even mistakenly believe that their words and actions have hidden good intentions. But how can those who dare to be traitors today, who have long alienated themselves from the ranks of the Chinese, be expected to plan for China and the Chinese because of their clever words and false deeds!

Why do some people fantasize about peace, leading them to fall for the enemy's poisonous schemes? First, because a few short-sighted women and children mistakenly believe the saying "it's better to live badly than to die well," thinking that the compatriots in the war zones have already lost their homes and families, and therefore should oppose peace. But why should those who can still maintain their lives and property today sacrifice their current lives by fantasizing about future victory? They do not know that "when the nest is overturned, no egg can remain intact." Japan has been plotting to destroy our nation for more than sixty years. Even if there is temporary peace today, it will soon swallow us like a whale or wolf. Even if a policy of appeasement is implemented today, once the regime is stable, it will mercilessly punish and destroy. The lessons of history are not far off! Second, because of a few feudal remnants and comprador capitalists. They mistakenly believe that the time of victory in the war of resistance is the day when a communist society will be implemented. Therefore, some harbor the delusion of preferring to give to the enemy rather than to their own family, while others dream of relying on the victorious nation to enjoy the wealth of Jewish people. The former suffer from failing to recognize that the victory in the war of resistance is the victory of the entire Chinese people, and that failure will lead to the extermination of all classes and races. The latter suffer from failing to recognize that today's fascist invaders are significantly different from the victorious nations of a hundred years ago, and from failing to face squarely the tragedy of Jewish people not being tolerated by German fascists today! In addition, the ruling classes of a few democratic and peaceful countries in the international community have also been misled by enemy propaganda and harbor thoughts of temporary peace. Therefore, the enemy and traitors' activities of inciting chaos can proceed without hindrance. Now that the enemy's sinister actions are approaching step by step, do those who hold this illusion know to repent?

The heroic resistance of twenty months has repeatedly shattered all the enemy and traitors' "peace" conspiracies. Recently, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Chinese Communist Party, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and the Third Plenary Session of the National Political Council have even declared to the world, on behalf of the people of all classes and sectors throughout China, the national policy of "consolidating unity and cooperation; resolutely resisting until the end and striving for final victory." How should our Chinese compatriots, who have blood, backbone, clear minds, and clear discernment between right and wrong, rise up to extricate themselves from the crisis of ten thousand eons without recovery, endure temporary hardships, and strive for eternal freedom and happiness! Today, the enemy is desperately using poisonous "peace" schemes in the midst of distress and danger, and the traitors are further fueling the flames. Some people, without deeply investigating, still think that the "peace" atmosphere is becoming thick again! But do they not think that after this "peace" smoke is used to create confusion again, an unprecedentedly cruel attack will soon unfold? The ancients said, "Rebellious ministers and traitors, everyone has the right to punish them." Are not all those who advocate "peace, anti-communism, and pro-Japan" the "rebellious ministers and traitors" of today? Those who hold the words and publications of rebellious ministers and traitors and echo "peace," "peace" every day, even if they do not pity themselves for being laughed at by the enemy, how can they not cherish their future?

### Salutations! The Brave Sons of Daya Bay

— Yu Lang

Daya Bay, an armored land,
The roar of national salvation intertwines with the surging waves,
Humiliation transforms into steely ambition,
To slay the enemy, the sea becomes their graveyard.

Defend Daya Bay, built with centuries of hard work!
Defend Daya Bay, woven with the blood, sweat, and tears of our ancestors!
The children of the sea take up even the most primitive weapons,
Wishing their hot blood to bring forth peace and freedom, willing to live and die with the nation!

— We once sang like this, and our singing has been realized. How did the brave sons of Daya Bay fight? Their great, heroic, and bloody battles leave a legacy of glorious pride for their descendants!

From the evening of October 11th, the most courageous volunteer corps of Aotou in Daya Bay received urgent intelligence and implemented extraordinary vigilance. Until the evening of the 12th, anger and passion burned in their hearts without ceasing. Like a great giant, they stood firm on the edge of Daya Bay. During this time:

At 5:00 AM on the 12th, enemy warships and aircraft, using cannons and bombs as cover, sent enemy soldiers to rush ashore at Xiayong. At the same time, the attack began at Shi Shu as well.

Confusion, embarrassment, and the cries of mothers calling for their children disturbed the entire Daya Bay. The black shadow of the god of war covered the human world. Old people muttered curses, kneeling and kowtowing on the ground, praying for the protection of gods and ancestors. Children were pulled from their dreams and thrown into carrying poles or tied to backs. What were the women doing? Busying themselves with this and that, not knowing whether to sew the small savings, the crystallization of decades of blood and sweat, into their collars or bury them under the bed, finally forgetting to bury them and running away, leaving them on the table.

At this moment, the Aotou volunteer corps quietly waited, biting their lips: "Yes, there is no mistake, this day has finally come. Wives separated from husbands, children separated from parents, homes destroyed, people killed. We young people will die on the battlefield. Yes! There is no mistake, this day has finally come!"

With what posture would they appear in this sacred war? They felt that the earth was about to darken, the sun was about to set, and they had to embrace that sun.

At 7:00 AM on the 12th, the bombing of Danshui began. A large squadron of enemy aircraft swirled like eagles over Danshui.

At this moment, the Aotou volunteer corps quietly waited.

In the afternoon, it completely turned into a river of rumors. Rumors, rumors, saying that the enemy had attacked Yonghu, that Danshui had fallen, that our defending forces had suffered a disastrous defeat.

At this moment, the Aotou volunteer corps quietly waited; however, this day, this hour, finally arrived. At nightfall, the Aotou defending forces fled with their tails between their legs. The enemy landed from Xiaogui. The defending forces of Dachong were surrounded. The war in Aotou finally began. The Aotou volunteer corps, these brave sons of Daya Bay, like giants, resolutely and swiftly plunged into the furnace of this war, using their most heroic battles to reflect the shamelessness and pitifulness of the escapists!

Holding their guns, instructing the bullets as if instructing their fishing gear and plowing cattle: "Obediently go to the enemy's chest and drink their fresh blood!" The vanguard! What about the Aotou volunteer corps? They are the children of the sea, with a posture like their mothers' surging torrents. Vanguard! And so, they rushed open a bloody path, and the defending forces were relieved of the siege.

People go crazy when they enter the war. The volunteer corps stationed at Ama Niang Temple were caught in an enemy encirclement with absolutely superior forces, but they also charged, braving the rain of bullets to break open a bloody path and break through.

A shameful defeat. The defending forces completely fled. The enemy had entered Danshui. Did the Aotou volunteer corps also flee? No! Their hometown had completely fallen, and they didn't know where their families had fled to. In the two fierce battles, several of their brothers had shed their last drop of blood for their country. Their bodies should belong to the nation. At the concentration in Ximahu, a steely decision was made: to continue fighting!

Starving, they wandered like wolves on the Huida military road in the darkness of night. Their only hope: to join up with the regular army and dedicate themselves anew to the motherland, seeking a glorious death in the sacred war. But in Yonghu, just as they picked up their chopsticks to eat, enemy cavalry rushed in again and quickly surrounded them. Faced with these fiercely attacking enemies, in the midst of sufficient hunger and fatigue, would these brave sons of Daya Bay completely surrender or be annihilated? However, no! A shocking and awe-inspiring scene was unfolding. Their squad leader took on this important role, using his individual gun to cover the safe retreat of the entire squad, breathing his last breath of his country under the dense machine-gun fire of the enemy. In addition, there was one other who also completed his hope and sacrificed gloriously. Those who were defended and came out, some joined the special task force, and some caught up with the main force, now undergoing the tempering of thousands of artillery fires on the West River front; they are all pursuing a glorious death.

What a glorious page of history this is! Today, wandering on the breakwater of Aotou, bathing in the glorious sunset light, we see the broken waves at the mouth of Hutou Men beckoning towards the distant place, we hear the waves crying sadly for those great names.

Mother Daya Bay has eternal sorrow and remembrance!

Bless the heroic souls who sacrificed heroically! Bless the brave soldiers who fought valiantly!

### Battle in Western Shanxi

— Guo Congzhou

The first route, based in Fenyang and Xiaoyi, passing through Dui Jiugu, Damaiziao, and He Yuanyang, invaded from the south. The enemy first occupied important places such as Chuankou, Shikou, Shuangchi, and Nuantou, and then moved east towards Sanjiao, Shixiu, Xixian, and Gaojiabian. Fierce fighting occurred with our forces.

The second route, based in Linfen, crossed the Fen River to the east and, passing through Dongxi Luqu, Sunqu, Tumen, and Heilongguan, invaded Puxian, Daning, Chakou, and Wanli. The enemy suffered the deepest losses.

The third route advanced west from Xiangling to Guyao, occupied the front and rear Guojiazhuang, and was met head-on and severely attacked by our Lu Ruiying Division, after which it fled north. Subsequently, a second bloody battle was fought west of Zhentou and Nanpochi. The enemy suffered heavy losses and then, via Qinwangling, merged with the invading forces west of Heilongguan.

The fourth route, based in Quwo, Houma, and Xinjiang, occupied Quanzhang, Zhaokang, and other places to the north. A certain regiment of a certain division of ours moved south from Gukou, and a certain division moved north to Huaijiwang Mountain, attacking from both the north and the south. The enemy was therefore unable to carry out its northward advance.

The fifth route, based in Hejin, fell into Fancun, Guzhen, Xikou, Xipo, and Maoziqu. One part advanced north along the Xiangning-Hejin highway, while the main force attacked our Dong Yumen. Subsequently, our forces recovered Dong Yumen. The enemy fled to Shijiawan, and also occupied Niangniangmiao, invading Xiangning and Jixian. At the beginning of this month, it again divided its forces into three routes from Jixian and attacked our river line at Xiaochuanwo, Qilangwo, Wang, Ma, Daomaguan, and Pingduguan.

After occupying various counties in western Shanxi, the enemy naturally wanted to realize the above five objectives. However, our political power and guerrillas were not only not "swept away," but also dealt a heavy blow to the enemy. The enemy wanted to cross the Yellow River in a certain month, but was also repelled by our army. After occupying Puxian, the enemy immediately forced civilians to build roads, but because of our army's constant harassment, the plan was not realized. From the 7th of this month, our army launched a large-scale counteroffensive, successively recovering Jixian, Daning, Puxian, Xiangning, Heilongguan, Heicheng, Nuanquan, and Shitou. Apart from the stalemate at Damaiziao, the enemy forces in western Shanxi were defeated by our forces, and the situation has generally returned to its pre-war state.

This time, the enemy's entire force of 20,000 who invaded from the west was commanded by the division commanders Taniguchi and Anan. Anan was in charge of the Fenyang-Xiaoyi route, and the remaining routes were in charge of Taniguchi. The Taniguchi Division (108th) was originally a supplementary service, mostly composed of old and weak soldiers. It suffered heavy losses in Jiang, Hengshuizhen, and Dalingguan in southern Shanxi. The former division commander Shimomoto and brigade commander Nakano were dismissed for failing to attack Yuanqu twice. The entire 105th Regiment was annihilated in Wangzhai, Qinshui. Anan's division suffered constant heavy losses on the Fenjiao Highway. A certain division stationed near Xiaoyi had a cavalry platoon, equipped with entirely foreign saddles and reins, completely seized from the Anan Division. It is a pity that this cavalry platoon is still short of several horses, because most of the division's military horses have been supplemented with farm horses. Therefore, the enemy equipped a large number of puppet troops. Wang Ying and Zhang Renjie's "Royal Collaboration Army" was stationed in Linfen and Fenxiao, and the notorious opium trafficker Pei Laowu's "Self-Defense Force" was stationed on the Hejin route. The composition of the puppet troops was mostly old people from Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Hejin, and Ronghe. Generally, the cavalry and artillery were Japanese, and the infantry was mostly puppet troops. Their weak combat effectiveness and poor quality can be imagined.

The clothing of the enemy and puppet troops was extremely tattered, and the ranks were very chaotic. It was reported that in each squad of ten people, six were in civilian clothes and eleven in military clothes, and they also wore the armbands of our 83rd Division and Teaching 1st Division to deceive our people. Because the people in our war zone implemented a scorched-earth policy against the enemy, and the enemy's supply lines were cut off everywhere by us, food became a major problem. The enemy had no choice but to search for cattle and sheep in the mountain gullies and move along with the troops to solve the problem of eating. At the same time, the enemy's method of attack was to encircle and attack in multiple routes, emphasizing the nature of "sweeping." Whenever attacking a place, they would first use aircraft to reconnoiter back and forth, and then dare to act after the cavalry had searched. This showed the enemy's panic and excessive vigilance towards us. Based on the above, the enemy's shortcomings are:

First, poor quality, low morale, and weakened combat effectiveness.

Second, the enemy feels threatened on its flanks and backs, and because of our "tight walls and clearing of the fields," rear supply is almost impossible.

Third, encirclement and attack in multiple routes is most easily broken by our superior forces in all directions.

Fourth, because of excessive vigilance towards us, the march is slow and opportunities are missed. As for our army, it has shown many advances and advantages.

First, in the short period of two weeks, we successively recovered various counties in western Shanxi, and successively annihilated about 3,000 enemy troops near Zigukou Hualezhen south of Xiangning on the east bank of the Yellow River, Diaokou northwest of Xiangling, Qinwangling, and Shijiapeng, greatly increasing our army's confidence in winning the war of resistance.

Second, following the martyrdom of Brigade Commander Xu Jizhang of Jiwang Mountain, this time Regiment Commander Wei Lingsha, Regiment Adjutant Zhao Degui, Battalion Commander Gao Linghan, and Battalion Commander Yuan Sandao of Nanbochi bravely sacrificed south of Hejin, greatly boosting morale.

Third, the people universally implemented a "firm wall and clearing of the fields" policy against the enemy, so that the enemy had nothing to eat and nothing to use, and had to drive cattle and sheep to move with the army, weakening the enemy's offensive strength.

Fourth, after the successive failures of the enemy's three "suppressions of Zhongtiao Mountain," "sweeping" of the Wutai area, attack on northwestern Shanxi, "nine-route encirclement of Yi-Qin," and "eight-route encirclement of Jixian to break the political center," it once again shattered the attack on old western Shanxi. This fact proves that it is impossible for the enemy to clear the flanks and threaten to "sweep" the anti-Japanese base areas. (January 15th)

### Selected Manuscripts from Our Newspaper's Middle School Essay Competition - The Problem of Middle School Students' National Salvation Work During the Winter Vacation

— Third Place, Queen's College, Zhu Xinghua

Middle school students are the backbone of society and the pillars of the nation. Especially Chinese middle school students, since the May Fourth Movement, have constantly created glorious achievements. In the national revolutionary movement of the past twenty years, middle school students have always been in a position of awakening vanguard, engaging in the work of liberating the nation. Now, the War of Resistance is entering a new stage, and new tasks require middle school students to shoulder the responsibility. Therefore, middle school students in 1939 should highly develop the traditional revolutionary spirit.

In the past, students in Hong Kong did not pay much attention to national affairs. When people in the mainland mentioned Hong Kong students, they always shook their heads and sighed. This actual situation was obviously created by the special environment.

However, since our nation launched an unprecedented all-out war of resistance, Hong Kong students have awakened like sleeping lions. There are quite a few middle school students who study and do national salvation work at the same time, but compared with students elsewhere, they are certainly behind. However, today's Hong Kong students have basically embarked on the road of awakening, which is a gratifying phenomenon. Now that this semester is coming to an end, what is unfolding before us is the long winter vacation. During this difficult period when the War of Resistance is entering a second new stage, we can undoubtedly put down our books and use this opportunity to develop our work of saving the nation.

Regarding the national salvation work during this winter vacation, in my personal opinion, it can be divided into two aspects: 1. Work in Hong Kong; 2. Work in our hometowns. Now, let's talk about the work in Hong Kong first:

I believe that students who have already participated in national salvation organizations should, during this vacation, strive to bring students who have not yet participated in national salvation work into the ranks of national salvation and walk on the same front. If not, even a passionate young man with a strong sense of nationalism will feel that there is no way to volunteer because no one is leading him, and he will be filled with regret. Therefore, we must try our best to bring them over, so that the strength of students' national salvation can be fully strengthened and the national anti-Japanese united front can be consolidated.

Speaking of national salvation organizations in Hong Kong, there are of course many, such as the Student Relief Association, the South China Relief Association, etc. No matter what organization it is, as long as it can guide us back to the national salvation front, then we should earnestly participate and earnestly shoulder the responsibility of national salvation.

Speaking of national salvation work in Hong Kong, it is indeed a bit different from the mainland. We cannot deny this special environment. All national salvation movements are different from those in the mainland in terms of methods, and there are many difficulties. But should we perfunctorily go through the motions because of difficulties, or cancel the work because of difficulties? No, a thousand and two no's. We must never perfunctorily go through the motions because of environmental difficulties, and we must never cancel the work because of environmental difficulties. On the contrary, the more difficult the environment, the more we use perseverance to overcome difficulties and the more we develop creativity to carry out our work.

In terms of implementation: (1) We must enthusiastically promote the "One Dollar to Repay the Nation" movement, and use the "One Dollar to Repay the Nation" movement to answer Wang Ni's shameless betrayal, to answer Wang Ni's divisive movement, and to sanction the mad invasion of the × people. At present, the "One Dollar to Repay the Nation" movement has been promoted by many national salvation organizations, and the results are not bad. But it must continue to be promoted so that every person can implement it, and everyone can become a powerful participant in the "One Dollar to Repay the Nation" movement. (2) We must strengthen the propaganda work of overseas Chinese. This matter may seem a bit difficult, but as long as we do our best and are determined to work hard and die hard, the difficulties can eventually be overcome.

There are of course many ways to carry out propaganda work, and they can be used flexibly. It is definitely not to ask people to sit on stools and stand on the street, giving a long and eloquent speech like selling medicine. We certainly cannot carry out large-scale public propaganda; however, legal and open propaganda can be done to a considerable extent. We can conduct propaganda work anytime and anywhere by soliciting donations, collecting comfort items, or using various convenient gatherings. This kind of propaganda can have two aspects of income: (A) It can raise more money to enrich the resources of the War of Resistance, and (B) It can strengthen the patriotic consciousness of overseas Chinese.

The × people are now constantly using the policy of instigating discord, charging general traitors and bandits, and spreading the atmosphere of peace and compromise everywhere. For example, in Singapore before, they spread leaflets that slandered and framed our government, and their lies were not worth a laugh, in an attempt to undermine our national salvation work. Furthermore, recently, Wang Ni's partisans have distributed propaganda for the division movement, etc. The methods of propaganda and explanation should be used anytime and anywhere to expose their conspiracies and crush their attempts, so that they cannot sell their tricks. Now it is winter, and our soldiers are fighting bloody battles with the violent × people, and countless compatriots are suffering, exposed to the wind and dew, and urgently need a large number of winter clothes to help them. At the same time, because of the ice and snow in the north, and the rainy season is coming soon. Therefore, the problem of winter clothes and raincoats is becoming more and more serious. Furthermore, the collection of medicines is indeed in urgent need. The soldiers at the front and the suffering compatriots are dying because of the lack of medicines.

Therefore, we should do our best to step up and expand our work of collecting money and goods. Other things, such as the relief of children who have dropped out of school, are urgent and are also a kind of local national salvation work.

Children are the future masters of China and the creators of the new China. If they are allowed to drop out of school now, the impact on the future of the country will be indescribable.

To provide relief to children who have dropped out of school here, I believe that during this winter vacation, students from various schools can use this opportunity to first borrow classrooms from their own schools to open children's schools or night schools, or contact other schools to borrow them. I believe they can always be found. Then, even if the schools are opened for only a few dozen days, they cannot achieve the benefits of giants, but we must not let this great time be wasted in the national salvation work we do. Even if there is only a quarter of an hour of time, we should use this quarter of an hour of precious time to do things that are beneficial to the country and the nation. Moreover, after the winter vacation, all schools can continue to convert all poverty-stricken schools into night schools. If this can be done, it will not only be the blessing of the refugee children, but also the great blessing of the Chinese nation.

(2) Regarding returning to our hometowns, we should organize hometown return groups before the winter vacation. Before organizing, we should prepare. Regarding the selection of volunteers, we must first investigate their national thinking, and secondly, those with richer skills and experience can be recruited to avoid affecting the work.

On the other hand, if we cannot organize a hometown return group, then we must individually go to national salvation organizations to participate in national salvation work. These two methods can be considered and implemented.

In the past, the masses had a vague understanding of this sacred war of resistance, so the masses' assistance to the government in resisting Japan was not active enough, and the military and civilians could not form a united front. Even many people, because of their weak awareness, were influenced by traitors and bandits, and there was a possibility of running to the traitors' ranks. In order to overcome these crises, we should actively train the masses, organize the masses, and at the same time actively carry out military and political work.

There is no doubt that returning to our hometowns is to assume the responsibility of organizing the masses, and to completely eliminate the previous estrangement between the government and the people with active work, to assist the government in completing the great plan of resisting Japan. At the same time, we should also pay close attention to the traitors and Trotskyites. The claws of the × people are distributed in every corner of our country - traitors and Trotskyites. These are the biggest enemies of national salvation work. If we can strengthen the organization of the masses, these ugly types will of course be unable to move. Otherwise, traitors and bandits can make a place smoky, completely Trotskyized or traitorized, and at least affect the future of the War of Resistance. This situation has occurred a lot in the War of Resistance in North China, and in South China. Since the shelling of Daya Bay, Huiyang, Dongguan, Zengcheng... fell, and Guangzhou was finished in less than ten days. This is of course a mistake of the authorities and insufficient vigilance, but the × people's network of traitors and sabotage is also not very serious, which is also one of the major reasons. Since the War of Resistance, half of the fall of every place has indeed fallen to traitors, so the biggest purpose of returning home is to organize the masses, train the masses, assist the government, and eliminate traitors.

Regarding returning home, we must first find the villages where wars are about to occur to start, organize the people in these villages, establish many guerrilla teams, and mobilize them to defend their homes.

Facts tell us that local tyrants and evil gentry often regard national salvation personnel as troublemakers and obstruct the progress of national salvation work in many ways because their feudal consciousness is unusually strong and because of local relations. They either profit from it in the name of saving the country, or distort government laws and decrees and wantonly extort money. If we encounter this situation, in addition to thoroughly clarifying the situation on the one hand to make them realize and turn back and work together to resist Japan, but if they are stubborn, we must use agile means to present them to the superiors, so that the superiors can eliminate poverty and corruption according to law, in order to purify the ranks of resistance.

Returning home is an urgent and serious work at present. I hope that all students in Hong Kong will take advantage of the winter vacation to enthusiastically participate in this great work and push our War of Resistance to a very favorable stage!

### Our Air Force Active on the Western Front, Fierce Battles for Days South of Tianmen, Xiang and Hubei Tense, × Attempting to Invade South

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 2nd] A Chinese military spokesman stated at a press conference that, except for the fighting in central Hubei last week, the front lines throughout China have been temporarily quiet. On the 19th of last month, the Japanese army in central Hubei Province received reinforcements from the eastern part of the province and attacked the Chinese army's front line to the west. On the 20th, the Japanese army occupied Tianmen, and the fighting then concentrated south of Tianmen. On the 23rd, the Chinese army abandoned Yuekou Town, 30 kilometers south of Tianmen. However, the Chinese army still occupies the main military strongholds in Hubei Province.

[Associated Press, Hankou, 2nd] The Japanese authorities here announced that the Japanese army has occupied Xingou, nine kilometers northwest of Nanjing and Shanxi, and is continuing to advance west. It also said that the Chinese army defending the Hanchuan area has several Soviet officers.

[Shanghai, 3rd] Foreign news, about 3,500 Japanese troops have departed for South China, attempting to land in Beihai. Also, three divisions and two brigades of Japanese troops in Wuchang are preparing to depart to invade Changsha and Nanchang. Chinese elite troops have been fully deployed. If the Japanese army invades south, it will inevitably suffer a serious blow.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 1st] (1) A certain detachment of our column, which is active between Fen and Huo, recently went to the western highlands to ambush more than 400 × at the southern end of the rail line. The battle was fierce, and the two sides fought hand-to-hand for two hours. × suffered more than half casualties. Our platoon leader and thirteen soldiers were killed. (2) Xiduzhen and Majia, between Jiexiu and Lingshi, have recently been occupied by ×. The four regions of Fen are surrounded by us in the north. (3) Our brave air force has been active on the western front for days, and the × in Qixian, Dagu, and Yuci in central Shanxi are quite panic-stricken. They have been actively setting up air defense facilities in recent days.

[People's Revolutionary Society, Xingji, 2nd] More than a thousand × troops and more than 30 cars and dozens of small cars in Fushan. In the afternoon of the 19th, a part of ×, more than a hundred, attacked eastward through Yujiapo and were defeated by our army. More than 30 × were killed, and the remaining × fled in panic. At the same time, more than 300 × and 12 cars, loaded with food and supplies, drove west. They were ambushed and attacked by our army. A total of 3 × cars were destroyed and 40-50 × were killed. In addition, a part of our volunteer army intercepted cars in Zuocun, west of the city, set up a car, and killed more than a dozen ×. The × in the city were very panic-stricken because their retreat was constantly intercepted by our army.

[People's Revolutionary Society, Xingji, 2nd] Since the 21st, the × near Yuncheng Bianchiy has been bombing our Yushuling and Bian'ao areas from time to time. We have no losses. A part of the × in Zhangcun fled to Yuncheng. There are still dozens of × in the village. A part of the × in Erliling fled to Shangjedidi (south of Ershilizhuang) in the afternoon of the 24th and was attacked by our cavalry. More than a dozen × were killed, and the remaining × fled back to Ershilizhuang.

[People's Revolutionary Society, Jingyu, 2nd] A platoon leader of our cavalry, leading five soldiers, all carrying short guns, ambushed in Hedongnei outside the east gate of Ningwu on the evening of the 21st. Soon, dozens of × soldiers passed by pushing rubber-wheeled vehicles. They were given a fierce attack. The × did not know that our army was gathered in large numbers and fled in all directions. At that time, the × on the city and at the station changed their positions by mistake and opened fire to intercept. The × in the city were in great chaos. Our army then retreated safely in the chaos. The × shot each other and only stopped at midnight. Both sides had casualties. On the same night, another part of our army destroyed the railway near Majiashu and then dismantled several miles of telegraph wires.

[People's Revolutionary Society, Xingji, 2nd] On the evening of the 21st, our army attacked Qiangfengchen (south of Qinggang) and defeated the × guarding the road. More than a dozen × were killed, dozens of workers were captured, five miles of railway tracks were destroyed, and dozens of telephone poles were cut down. The remaining × all fled in panic.

[People's Revolutionary Society, Shijie, 2nd] The × in Lijiaao has recently increased by more than a hundred. Japanese account for two-tenths, Northeasterners seven-tenths, and Tianjin people one-tenth. There is no change in the × in Zhongyang and Lishi. However, they are gradually strengthening their fortifications. The Fenyang × military station and a law enforcement headquarters stationed in Sanquan Fenyang have recently been withdrawn to Taiyuan for unknown reasons.

### Stout Men from Various Places in Fujian Voluntarily Enlist, Prisoners Repent and Volunteer to Serve the Country, Public Anti-Japanese Sentiment Rises

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 1st] Since the War of Resistance, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people in various parts of Fujian Province has erupted, and the people's consciousness has risen sharply. Stout men have been requesting to enlist in the army to serve the country, and there have been many daily requests. (1) Yesterday, 34 stout men from Pingxi, the third district of Shouning County, a remote area on the border of Fujian and Zhejiang, volunteered to the district office to enlist in the army and participate in the war to kill ×. The district office respectfully sent them to the army. All sectors of society in Shouning immediately held a meeting to celebrate them, and relatives and friends prepared a feast to see them off, decorating with ribbons and firing cannons, which was extremely grand. (2) Liu Jinhuo, the only son of the first district of Lianjiang County, went directly to the county government yesterday, requested to see the county magistrate and volunteered to enlist in the army, taking the initiative to reduce the government's difficulties in handling military service. The county magistrate praised his ambition and immediately summoned all the county personnel, fired cannons in the team, and personally sent him to the camp. The people gambled and praised each other, and everyone was inspired. (3) Lv Songgui, Huang Shenggu and other four stout men from Jianyang County volunteered to the district office yesterday to serve in the military. The district office praised them for their actions and sent them to the camp. The people praised them on the streets. (4) Wu Fengting and other 53 prisoners in Xianyou County recently jointly returned to the self-defense regiment and volunteered to serve in the army to repent and serve the country.

### Yunnan Construction Department Develops Sericulture

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 1st] In order to develop the silkworm industry in Yunnan, the Yunnan Construction Department previously received assistance from the central government to establish a sericulture improvement institute, which promoted it in seven regions, with the Changfang area as the center, cultivating silkworm eggs and supplying them to various places. Silkworm eggs were purchased from Sichuan and will soon begin to be cultivated. It is determined to complete the promotion work in the Chuxiong, Baoshan, and Menghua districts this year. The climate in Yunnan is extremely suitable for the sericulture industry, and the future is extremely bright. It is expected that in the future, it can reach more than 50,000 dan per year. Calculated at 1,500 yuan per dan, the annual profit is very considerable. Now, in order to develop it in large quantities, the Bank of China and the Fudian Bank have jointly invested in building a "New Sericulture Village" in the Kaiyuan area to engage in mulberry planting, and the Fudian Bank has begun to build a silk reeling factory.

### The Army and People of Hainan Rely on Teams to Resist Japan, Food Panic After the Occupation of Haikou, More Than a Thousand Sick Due to Acclimatization

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 2nd] According to news from Chinese sources, since the Japanese army occupied Hainan Island, the number of people who died has reached 5,000, and reinforcements have been sent six times. At present, they are still fighting hard with the mountain warfare teams. At the same time, the Japanese army is very unaccustomed to the climate of Hainan Island, and more than a thousand people are sick.

[Hong Kong News] Since the × landed on Hainan Island, the communication between Hong Kong and Qiong has been suspended, and the news is very isolated. In order to understand the various news about Hainan, the reporter specially investigated the relevant parties yesterday and recorded the following information. After the × occupied Haikou, they wanted to organize a puppet Qiongya maintenance association and planned to summon Ye Ren, the shop owner of Dongfang Pharmacy in Haikou, to be the puppet chairman. Knowing the great righteousness, Ren refused three times. × was furious and killed Ye and exposed the body on the road. Dozens of people were killed by × in this way. Other young people who communicated with them were also detained. As for livestock, chickens, and ducks, they were all slaughtered. The area has many high mountains and forests, and there is very little arable land. Therefore, food has always been supplied by Annam, Nanyang, Siam, and other places. Since the × landed, ships from various places have stopped going there. Last year, there was also a crop failure, so the source of rice was in short supply, and prices have soared since the × landed. Now, the market price of white rice is five or six yuan per dan. The general poor people are in danger of starving to death. The terrain is naturally steep and dangerous, and the middle, east, west, and south are mostly high mountains. The beaches and reefs on the coast can only be used for small boats to berth when the tide is high. Now our army is based in the area west of Jiaji and stubbornly resists the danger. Now, Liu, a veteran of the Red Army on the island, has recruited strong men and Li people ×× people and formed them into a team, teaching them guerrilla tactics, based on the Wuzhi Mountain area, and fighting with ×. It is found that the people in the area are strong and fierce and cannot be subdued by guns and artillery. If the government provides effective assistance, it will not be impossible to drive the × out of the country. Therefore, the × people's desire to settle in Hainan Island will not be possible.

### French Foreign Minister Bonnet Reports on the Hainan Incident

[Central News Agency, Paris, 1st] Foreign Minister Bonnet attended the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives this afternoon to explain various issues of the international situation. Regarding the occupation of Hainan Island by the Japanese army, he said that the French government has protested to the Tokyo government, and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita has provided assurances that the occupation is temporary and will not exceed the period of military operations against China. The French government has sent a warship to the waters off Hainan Island, and the US government has done the same.

### Kong Xiangxi's Report at the Political Council on the Political Situation in Border Provinces – Fourth Political Report of March –

(Continued from page 3 of the previous day)

Next is the issue of opium suppression. The government will exert its utmost efforts to continue its work, with particular emphasis on the work of banning opium smoking, in order to eradicate the scourge of drugs.

Completion of the Establishment of Xikang Province

Currently, the most important work in the rear is the development of the Southwest and Northwest. As you all know, Sichuan's rear area also includes the resource-rich Xikang. The government has been preparing for the establishment of a province in Xikang for many years. On New Year's Day this year, Xikang Province was officially established. The central government's development of Xikang starts with transportation. The first phase of financial subsidies and the provision of technical personnel are the central government's responsibilities. In addition to the specialized resolutions directly undertaken by the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Xikang, the central government has decided to subsidize the Xikang government with 750,000 yuan this year. Secondly, what the central and local governments are jointly paying attention to is the mutual harmony among the people within Xikang. Under the National Government, the people of the Republic of China, regardless of race or religion, enjoy equal rights. This is something that need not be elaborated on. There are ethnic minorities in Xikang whose customs are different from those of the general population, and their level of culture is also slightly lower. We should support them, not only to raise their cultural level but also to solve their living difficulties.

Reincarnation Events of Lamas

Behind Xikang is Tibet. Since the War of Resistance, the Tibetan compatriots have deeply understood the great righteousness and unanimously supported the national policy. Naturally, the central government follows the teachings of the Premier, uniting all ethnic groups on the principle of equality and building a great nation. We absolutely respect the traditional religion of Tibet. We believe that the welfare of the Tibetan compatriots is the welfare of the entire nation. As for local administration, we believe that it should be presided over by Tibetan political and religious leaders who know the local situation well. The central government and neighboring provinces should not arbitrarily interfere. The reason I am specifically mentioning Tibet to you today is for another reason, which is that the reincarnation of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama will be chosen this year. According to established customs, the Tibetan officials have already found two spiritual children in Tibet, and another one near the Tar Monastery in Qinghai. The central government has ordered the Qinghai Provincial Government to escort the one in Qinghai to Tibet. In the future, the three spiritual children will hold the most solemn lottery ceremony at the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa. The National Government dispatched Chairman Wu of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission on December 28th of last year to jointly preside over the matter with the Tibetan regent Reting Rinpoche. Xinjiang Unites

We are extremely gratified by the spirit of perseverance in the War of Resistance and the contributions of manpower, material resources, and financial resources to the country by our Hui compatriots. This is because the [Japanese] not only actively invade our territory militarily but also politically strengthen the division of our nation. Since the War of Resistance, under the leadership of the Supreme Commander, Hui compatriots have been leading troops bravely to kill the [Japanese] as generals, and local officials have also been able to mobilize the masses and financial resources, and automatically organize propaganda teams to awaken the people and inspire patriotic sentiments, or organize rescue teams to participate in front-line teaching and care for wounded soldiers, or visit countries in the Near East to win friendly nations' assistance to our country's War of Resistance. These are all facts that everyone knows. What is especially gratifying is the rapid progress of the situation in Xinjiang. The nationalities in Xinjiang, which are extremely complex, have now been effectively united under the leadership of Governor Sheng Shicai. Recently, they have even donated funds to purchase aircraft and offer them to the government to assist in the War of Resistance. Their patriotic enthusiasm is truly commendable.

Mongolian Compatriots Love the Country

Mongolian compatriots, in this great era, can also unite with us in spirit. The religious leader of Mongolia, Zhangjia Hutuktu, came to Chongqing to participate in the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. The political leader of Mongolia, the League Chief of the Ikh Zhao League, Prince Sha, recently came to Chongqing to take a seat on the National Government Committee. The enthusiasm of the Living Buddha Zhangjia and Prince Sha for the War of Resistance and national construction is admired by compatriots across the country.

Overseas Chinese Support the War of Resistance

As for the fervent spirit of overseas Chinese in cherishing their motherland, it is deeply inspiring. Since the War of Resistance, wealthy overseas Chinese have certainly been donating as much as possible to the government to support the national policy, but what is most admirable is that ordinary overseas Chinese are saving money on food and clothing, bit by bit, to contribute to the motherland, or returning thousands of miles to participate in the fighting. Their loyal, courageous, and decisive actions are especially inspiring.

Thoroughly Improve Education

In terms of education, although the [Japanese] talk highly of Eastern civilization, their methods of warfare not only show no regard for cultural institutions but specifically target schools for bombing and destruction. Their insidious intentions are conceivable. Many of you have been engaged in educational careers for many years. You are well aware of the suffering the education sector has endured and the devastation the education cause has suffered since the War of Resistance, so there is no need for me to say more. The Ministry of Education has already discussed the relocation of schools in the war zone and the resettlement of teachers and students in the war zone in its previous two reports. Due to the expansion of the war zone, this work has continued in the last three months. Since last winter, many school youths have lacked clothes to ward off the cold. The government issued student cotton quilts and clothing subsidies of 300,000 yuan in November of last year. Since the retreat from Wuhan, a large number of students from Hubei Province have also withdrawn. The government has found ways to accommodate them and has subsidized two national secondary schools in Hubei Province to expand their scope and accommodate them as much as possible. For the students in Hunan, the central government has responded to the request of the people of Hunan and decided to establish a national secondary school. Now that the number of national secondary schools has gradually increased, the government intends to adjust them to avoid various inconveniences in administration and teaching. War can teach people. We should use the experience of this war to conduct a deep review of the past education system, such as whether the regional distribution of cultural institutions before the war was reasonable, and whether the pre-war educational policies that emphasized intellectual pursuits and neglected physical and moral education could lead to the healthy development of young people. When the war is tense and the government urgently needs people, there are still many unemployed educated youths. Doesn't this expose the great shortcomings of the education we have run in the past? I believe that we should give very serious consideration to these issues and seek fundamental improvements so that future education can make greater progress.

### Promoting Education in Guerrilla Areas with Planning – War-time Education Association Drafts Plan – Submits to the Ministry of Education for Adoption and Implementation

[Chongqing Correspondence] The National Wartime Education Association held its 15th Standing Council meeting, chaired by Zhang Shenfu. First, Zhu Qixian reported on five constructive proposals for educational development submitted to the Third National Education Conference: (1) Actively promoting education work in the war zone; (2) Actively promoting education work in the guerrilla areas with planning; (3) Stockpiling grain to enrich education work in guerrilla bases; (4) Creating and promoting education work in [Japanese] strongholds and the Northeast with planning; (5) Establishing a central mechanism to determine the central work for the planned implementation of education work in the war zone and behind [Japanese] lines. These five cases can be independent when separated, but together they form a set of education work plans for the war zone and behind [Japanese] lines. The methods in the first four cases involve educational content, teacher training, teaching material supply, and educational funding issues. More attention is paid to the methods and methods that fit the situation of the War of Resistance. The fifth case explains how to effectively implement various methods. All proposals have been submitted to the Ministry of Education (omitted). Then Wang Zhuoran proposed that the association launch a wartime education symposium, which was approved. Members of the association in Chongqing and educational experts were invited to participate, held every two weeks. The meeting then discussed and approved many cases concerning the development of association affairs.

### [Japanese] Cabinet Approves – Army and Navy Budget – 4.6 Billion Yen for Invasion of China – Financial Difficulties Compensated by Large-Scale Issuance of Public Bonds

### Shanghai Concession Incident – Both Sides Compromise – [Japanese] Plan to Set Up Foreign Exchange Bureau in North China – British House of Commons Discusses Situation in Tianjin and Shanghai

[Shanghai, AP, 2nd] According to reliable sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council has compromised with the Japanese side in the hope of reversing the Japanese side's tough attitude.

[London, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler declared in the House of Commons yesterday that the British government cannot recognize the Nanjing puppet regime. He also said that the government has not received official reports regarding the Nanjing puppet regime's covert resistance to the rights and interests of the Shanghai Public and French Concessions and the affairs of the Central France in the Far East shipping industry.

[London, Reuters, 1st] In the British House of Commons this week, MP Hanners questioned the situation of Japan erecting barbed wire and electrifying it around the French Concession in Tianjin, and setting up other defenses. The Under-Secretary replied that this matter is being negotiated with the Japanese authorities.

[Beijing, Reuters, 2nd] The puppet organization authorities here have announced plans to set up foreign exchange bureaus in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Yantai, in order to further establish the "new government" sponsored by Japan's control over import and export trade.

### Large Explosion at [Japanese] Ammunition Depot Near Osaka – Losses Exceed 50 Million Yen – Fire Spreads Over One Mile – Traffic Between Osaka and Kyoto Cut Off

[Osaka, Haitong News Agency, 2nd] A fire broke out at the Japanese ammunition depot in Hirakata near Osaka on Wednesday. The fire was still extremely fierce last night. The losses are much greater than originally estimated. Although there is no official report on the number of deaths, it is believed to be extremely high. Amidst the explosions of ammunition, workers lost their lives, and the fire started, like a prairie fire. Firefighters could not approach. The entire ammunition depot was burned down. Although the fire brigade tried its best to put out the fire, it was not until last night that it was able to control the fire. The official announcement was very brief. Last night's communiqué stated that order had been restored and the citizens were calm. The Japanese army also participated in the firefighting work, including an infantry battalion, a company of engineers, four rescue teams, 1,000 policemen, and 117 firefighters. The Japanese army has suffered heavy losses in this fire. According to official estimates, the loss of machinery, military supplies, and houses is more than 50 million yen. The Japanese ammunition depot will not be usable for at least a year.

[Tokyo, Reuters, 2nd] The Osaka suburban army powder depot suddenly caught fire yesterday, with continuous explosions lasting for four hours. The fire spread over more than one mile. Most of the schools and factories in Osaka were burned down, and there were many deaths and injuries. However, officials refused to release the numbers for several days.

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 2nd] According to dispatches from Tokyo, the Japanese government has recently dispatched a large number of army engineers, an infantry battalion, and 400 rescue team members to the disaster area in Osaka to cooperate with 2,000 soldiers and policemen from the 16th Division in Kyoto and 117 fire brigades to put out the fire. Railway traffic has now been restored, and the spread of the fire has also stopped.

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 2nd] According to dispatches from Tokyo, after the explosion at the ammunition depot near Osaka yesterday, a major fire was triggered, resulting in many deaths and injuries. Today, all the fire brigades and troops in the city have been mobilized to put out the fire, but the work is extremely difficult due to the high temperature at the fire site. It is still impossible to count how many people were killed in the depot when the ammunition depot exploded, but the deaths and injuries around the depot have exceeded 100 people. The area within two kilometers of the ammunition depot is now guarded by the army, and traffic is cut off. The route between Osaka and Kyoto was destroyed by the explosion, and traffic has now been interrupted.

### On the Road in Western Hunan

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya

Regarding the major events in Hunan, surrounded by mountains, waters, and lush forests, I took advantage of the time waiting for the bus on the morning I left Changsha to take a walk at the foot of Yuelu Mountain to pay my respects. The school inherited the Yuelu Academy and has a thousand-year history. Even the smallest piece of tile or stone is of great value to cultural history. The library's collection of books is extremely precious, such as old Song and Yuan editions, manuscripts of famous people, and unique rare books, all of which are listed as treasures. There are also the instruments and specimens that the Science Museum has continuously added over the past forty years. Their completeness and importance cannot be matched by one place at one time, nor can they all be repurchased with tens of thousands of yuan. In addition, the classrooms and dormitories are also very grand, with the whole scene appearing faintly in the mountain scenery, which looks very beautiful. But it is heartbreaking! They were all bombed and burned by [Japanese] planes, leaving them riddled with holes! In particular, the library and the science museum itself and their vicinity were intensively bombed with more than one hundred bombs. Many precious ancient sites, books, and instruments and specimens were all destroyed into rubble and ashes. This is indeed a great loss for us and for the world's culture! I will no longer describe it here, because Uncle Shu already said when describing the Changsha fire: We must seek compensation for all losses from the [Japanese] in the victory of the War of Resistance. We don't have to dwell on the current disaster too much!

Returning to the station, the bus soon headed west. The flatness and straightness of the highway, and the richness and vastness of the farmland, aroused the envy of a Guangxi army officer, who repeatedly said that it was more than "better than Guangxi." An endless stream of cotton loads, as well as herds of mules and horses, carrying countless sets of military cotton clothing, were constantly flowing eastward. The rice and cotton production in the Dongting Lake area of western Hunan are very abundant, which can be seen from this. Along the way, through the towns and villages of Ningxiang, Yiyang, and Hanshou counties, wherever there were markets, they were bustling with people and goods piled up like mountains, as if they did not feel threatened by [Japanese] planes. The people in the countryside like to wrap their heads with cloth. Men use black scarves, and women use white cloth, layered and stacked, as thick as three or four inches, tightly circled on the head, which is very similar to the "head covering" used by the people of Sichuan; however, western Hunan uses more cloth, perhaps a reflection of the abundance of cotton production?

Originally, the significance of western Hunan in national defense is indeed very important. In terms of products: the abundance of rice, tung oil, fir, cotton, minerals, etc., is well-known throughout the country; in terms of geography: the mountains are intricate, and the lakes and swamps are scattered; it is the gateway to the provinces of Sichuan and Guizhou, and the hub of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River; in terms of transportation: there is the vast Dongting Lake, the southern extremity of the Xiao and Xiang rivers, and the northern passage to the Wu Gorges, and there is the Xiangdian Highway, winding for thousands of miles to connect internationally. Moreover, we are now using the southwest as a base for long-term resistance, and western Hunan is even more our national defense stronghold. If we want to strengthen the foundation for future strategic counter-offensive, we must consolidate western Hunan. We truly hope that western Hunan will become the Verdun of the First World War!

The scenery seen on the way that day was that what was being transported eastward was cotton, cotton clothing, and other practical goods, which are indispensable to the four essential elements of life; what about what was being transported westward? It seemed to be only the passengers on our buses, and some groups of three or five wounded soldiers walking with sticks. In short, it seemed that they were all "consumers." However, this is not a mixed feeling, because in peacetime, most of the goods transported westward were imported goods. We are now going west without imported goods to follow, which is enough to show the nobility of our "authentic domestic goods." What's more, there are these soldiers who bravely killed the [Japanese] on the front line, carrying glorious wounds, hunching over and helping each other, shouting and responding to each other, which is a characteristic that goods heading east do not have, and a glory unique to goods heading west!

However, an unpleasant thing happened when the car passed the Zijiang Ferry. Several wounded soldiers requested a ride. Everyone welcomed them, but there were too many people and there was not enough room to sit. One of them, who was lively and had a violent temper, actually occupied the driver's seat and started messing with the machine parts:

"Chinese people sitting in Chinese cars, what's wrong with that? Drive! Drive! Drive!" Such a big hat-wearing words came from the mouth of a wounded and walking honor soldier with a lower level of knowledge, which is forgivable. After the escort interfered and said that he "shouldn't mess with the machine parts if he's just taking a ride," he roared even more and pointed at the escort, who was wearing a suit, as if he had caught a rare fish and said triumphantly:

"Don't think you can wear that foreign tiger skin. If you arouse my old man's anger, I'll tear it off and see if your flesh is whiter than others'!" Although the words were wild, they had a bit of venerating China and suppressing the West, and preserving the essence of the country, which seems not to be criticized too much. However, his behavior became more and more unacceptable, and it was hard to compliment him. After he said the wild words, he began to grope in his pockets and trouser pockets, indicating that he would use handguns and hand grenades to treat the escorts. However, the escorts were not frightened by the false alarms, and responded with a few sneers. So he became angry out of shame, as if blaming the car for not automatically taking him away, and then vigorously shook the car's "handle" and shouted all kinds of curses such as "Damn it! Drive! Drive!" and attacked people everywhere like a machine gun!

Who knew that this shaking and shaking actually shook out a one-legged hero who helped when he saw injustice. This one-legged hero, with his left hand holding the car window and his right hand holding a crutch, got off the car happily and went to him to question him:

"Which unit are you from? Show me your symbol!" The one-legged hero tilted his body half-way, with his crutch clamped under his right arm. Another group of soldiers with the same red cross badge of honor gathered around him like stars surrounding the moon, forming a semi-circle.

"I'm from the ××× Division. I lost my symbol and haven't replaced it yet." He knew that things were a bit awkward, and his voice trembled slightly.

"Where is the wound mark?" He asked sternly.

"On my left rib; it hasn't been a few days." Officer, I..." His voice trembled even more.

"It hasn't been a few days! Humph! No wonder you're agile and full of energy—so you're deliberately trying to ruin the reputation of us (wounded soldiers), you fake wounded soldier!" Once the charges were judged clearly, it immediately aroused public outrage (of the wounded soldiers), and the sound of "beat him! beat him! beat him!" was like thunder. Someone grabbed him, and for a moment, fists and crutches were sent towards him like hitting iron, beating him to scream strangely...

At that time, although some people (still wounded soldiers) cherished their comrades for the country and begged them to be careful not to injure the hand he used to hold the gun; at the same time, the escort was still afraid of turning it into a murder case and came back and forth to shield him like a mother hen protecting her chicks; finally, military police arrived from the ferry after hearing the noise and luckily rescued him from the heavily besieged "Eight Trigrams Formation"; but he had already suffered enough of the loss of a fake Li Da meeting a real Li Kui and was beaten by them into a "genuine" wounded soldier with real injuries!

This unexpected tragicomedy (actually, joy outweighs the suffering) was declared closed; the bus then carried a few more "red cross" victory soldiers who had been newly awarded honors, and drove straight to Changde, an important town in western Hunan, with suppressed smiles.

### British Labour Party MP Strongly Advocates Sanctions Against Aggression, Severely Condemns Japanese Military Actions in the House of Lords, Suggests Group Action to Punish

[Reuters, London, 1st] Tonight, Labour Party MP Lord Strabolgi questioned the government in the House of Lords regarding the situation in the Sino-Japanese War, and what steps the government would take to protect British interests in Hong Kong. He stated that he raised this question not to embarrass the government. Mr. Plymouth's speech in the House of Lords debate on foreign affairs last December was unexpected, and his firm stance on the important issue of British interests in China was welcomed by all parties. Mr. Plymouth's speech was nothing less than a straightforward warning, that Britain's patience is not unlimited. Since the last debate, some of the most important events have occurred in China. Since the fall of Guangzhou and Japan's threat to the Shanghai Concession authorities, Hainan Island has also been invaded. In fact, Hong Kong has been largely blockaded by Japan. He very much wishes to see Japan change its attitude, but the puppet Nanjing Reformed Government has used arrogant language to oppose the British and French communities in the Shanghai Public Concession. Japan's invasion of Hainan Island is the most blatant invasion. As far as the war against the Chinese central government is concerned, Japan's move has no military purpose. The French authorities in Annam have stopped the import of military supplies into China via Vietnam, and even the relief medicines of the Red Cross have been stopped from entering China via Vietnam at Japan's request. Japan has therefore admitted that Hainan Island is within the sphere of French interests and has not attacked it. However, in fact, Japan has brazenly taken this action, which shows that, as far as Japan is concerned, the so-called appeasement policy is useless. He mentioned the road from Burma to southwest China, saying that Japan knows the words of warning, and this is the reason. We use a long-term perspective to observe that China today is fighting for us. If Japan had defeated Chinese resistance in two years or three months, how long would Hong Kong, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies be threatened? If Japan conquers China and we have troubles in Europe, do you believe that British interests in the Pacific will not be disturbed? Strabolgi stated that Japan's war against China is not an old-fashioned war of conquest, but the most brutal war of a beastly nature. The Japanese authorities in "Manchukuo" have deliberately used opium and other drugs to anesthetize the Chinese, and systematically destroy Chinese universities and academic institutions. Japan has created corrupt puppet organizations in the occupied areas, committing all kinds of evils and completely excluding the interests of European and American merchants. The Japanese atrocities are appalling, and the Foreign Office is well aware of them. When Japan occupied Nanjing, it condoned the soldiers' atrocities, and British and American people were also humiliated. Strabolgi stated that he had repeatedly criticized the German system, but the behavior of German Nazi officials in Nanjing was commendable. They cooperated in rescuing refugees to avoid being massacred and abused by undisciplined and barbaric Japanese troops. Strabolgi then protested against the Japanese warships attacking unarmed fishing boats, saying that Chinese fishermen and sailors are excellent people who practice mutual assistance. If we are in danger at sea, they will come to rescue us. They bring their wives and children with them, and Japanese planes attack these unarmed fishermen. This is the most heinous act, beyond words. He believes that the government has protested and that the government has not turned a blind eye to this matter. Regarding the behavior of German Nazi officials in Nanjing, he said that German merchants, like British merchants, were shocked by the Japanese atrocities in China. Only German officials took a supportive attitude towards the Japanese authorities. The German government now has a good opportunity to show its sincerity, humanity, and enthusiasm for peace, that is, to unite with us and other related countries to use diplomatic and economic pressure to stop the Japanese warlords' dangerous actions in China. Hitler once said that Germany must export, otherwise it will perish. The vast market in China can be developed, but if Japan's policy succeeds, Germany will have no opportunity to develop trade in the Chinese market. After twenty years of struggle, anyone with common sense knows that Japan is an economically vulnerable country, especially now, most easily affected by economic oppression. Japanese soldiers do not want to see a unified and healthy China. They want to occupy all of China. If Japanese soldiers' desire succeeds, it will inevitably threaten Australia. Today, justice and public opinion no longer allow for tolerance. Can we begin to change our policy towards East Asia? I firmly believe that we can get enthusiastic support from India, Australia, New Zealand, and even France, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands. The policy I propose is peaceful, and it can be expected to be effective without firing a single bullet. This move should have been initiated by the League of Nations, but if the British government can initiate group political, economic, and financial sanctions, it will be enough to punish the aggressors and their brutal troops.

The Under-Secretary Reaffirms That The Nine-Power Treaty Is Valid

Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Earl of Plymouth, responded on behalf of the government: He mostly agreed with what Lord Strabolgi said in his debate, but some of his suggestions were not easy to implement and he was afraid that they had not been carefully considered. After Plymouth reported on the situation in China, he listed the actions taken by the British government to protect its rights and interests in China, especially in Hong Kong, saying that the Pearl River is very important to Hong Kong's commerce. Since the fall of Guangzhou, it has been blockaded by the Japanese army until now. The government has actively negotiated to open it as soon as possible, but there has been no effect, which is a pity. The government is currently considering further negotiations. The British government is determined to make its utmost efforts to maintain commercial relations with the occupied areas. According to recent intelligence, although the Guangdong Customs has not been completely subordinated to the Japanese army, part of its power has been taken over by the Japanese, the situation is the same as the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, and the situation of Haikou Customs is also the same. At this point, he reported on the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island and added that the Foreign Minister had stated tomorrow that once the military needs are completed, Hainan will be abandoned. The island does have its important strategic and tactical value, but Britain actually has no important rights and interests to speak of on the island, but the position of the French government is completely different, because French rights and interests have two guarantees, namely the Sino-French Treaty of 1897 and the Franco-Japanese Agreement of 1907. Britain and Japan originally did not have this agreement, and the only one is the Nine-Power Treaty. As for Strabolgi's criticism that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island does not threaten the Chinese government but threatens Britain and France, it is difficult to draw a conclusion at present. For the time being, we can only take the explanation provided by the Japanese side as the reason for their invasion of Hainan Island. As for the so-called "once the military needs are completed," it is indeed empty talk, but that is all the Japanese side has provided. Regarding the terrorist incidents in Shanghai, the Japanese side has suggested a method of maintaining law and order to the Public Works Department. The government is paying close attention to this matter and is prepared to cooperate with the Public Works Department at any time. The United States has also taken the same steps. As for the rumors that the "Reformed Government" was forced to declare war on the Public Works Department, the British ambassador has not reported confirmation, so it is not convenient to discuss it for the time being. But we must know that Britain has never recognized the "Reformed Government," so its every word and deed may not be taken seriously. In Tianjin, the British government has tried its best to make the Japanese government understand the position of the concession authorities. Continuing, the government's Far East policy is based on the Nine-Power Treaty. Some say that the treaty is no longer suitable for the current environment, but Britain absolutely cannot agree. Britain believes that all treaties are permanent. If Japan or any country has any suggestions for amendments, Britain is ready to discuss them at any time. Similarly, the British government is also ready to resume negotiations with the Chinese government on extraterritoriality and other issues after the restoration of peace. Regarding the above points, the Japanese government was notified in writing on January 14. The government believes that the suggestions made by Lord Strabolgi are not a way to solve all difficult problems or improve the situation. Methods such as economic sanctions cannot be effective unless all relevant countries implement them together. Plymouth concluded by saying that he hoped that all members of the House would appreciate the government's past efforts to aid China. Since the outbreak of the war, Hong Kong has been an important hub for Chinese transportation. Recently, a road has been built from Burma directly to the Chinese border. Recently, it has also provided China with the convenience of credit loans. The government will continue to pay close attention to the situation in the Far East. Some have asked whether the government can put pressure on Japan to quickly stop the war against China. He believes that it is not easy, but the British government is constantly meeting closely with relevant countries to seek a fair and equal solution to China and Japan that also takes into account the interests of third countries. The government has notified the Chinese and Japanese governments of its sincerity in this mediation, but so far the situation has not improved, and the hope of mediation is still slim. After the Under-Secretary finished answering, Lord Strabolgi thanked him, indicating the end.

### U.S. Senate to Re-discuss the Issue of Fortifying Guam, Fortifying the Coast of Hawaii and the Philippines, Hull Opposes Amendment to the Neutrality Act

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] The U.S. Senate Naval Affairs Committee has taken steps to re-raise the issue of fortifying Guam. The committee has decided to hear the opinions of all parties on this issue and invited all proponents to state their opinions.

[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] The Senate Naval Affairs Committee announced today that it will hold another discussion on the issue of fortifying Guam next Monday. Massachusetts Democratic Senator Walsh said that fortifying Guam is still a fresh issue, and the Naval Affairs Committee must have a frank understanding of this issue. Isolationist senators are advocating limiting the aircraft funding in the defense bill to $1,700,000,000. Secretary of War Woodring and several other government officials have expressed their opposition to the proposal of twelve senators that a public referendum must be held before waging war against foreign countries. Isolationists have strongly criticized the U.S. government's foreign policy (including the defense bill) and expanded the debate on the issue of fortifying Guam. Senator Borah also expressed his opposition to fortifying Guam.

[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] The House Appropriations Committee today reported a military construction bill of $500 million, including $6 million to build defenses in Hawaii and the Canal Zone, and $4,285,000 to build and strengthen coastal defenses in Panama, Hawaii, and the Philippine Islands.

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] U.S. Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement reiterating the government's opposition to the Ludlow Amendment to the Neutrality Act (that the U.S. government must hold a national referendum before declaring war on foreign countries to see public opinion), saying that the amendment violates representative democracy.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] Naval authorities said that 600 naval aircraft held a large-scale exercise a few days ago, which ended yesterday. The scale of this exercise was unprecedented in U.S. history, and there were no accidents during the exercise.

### Expanding the Air Force, Storing Materials

[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] The House Appropriations Committee today reported on the bill for the War Department's expenses of $499,857,936 for the year starting July 1 this year. This is the largest expenditure for the U.S. regular army since the European War, and it also proposed immediately allocating $50 million for expanding the air force so that the first line of defense aircraft reaches 3,200. The committee report repeatedly stated that President Roosevelt will send a supplementary budget to Congress, requesting additional appropriations.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] U.S. Air Force Commander Major General Arnold said that if the United States actively increases the production of aircraft under emergency conditions, it will take at least three years to prepare for the United States to produce 1,000 aircraft per month. Currently, only Germany manufactures 1,000 aircraft per month. The War Department now plans to allocate funds under routine expenses to purchase 565 aircraft of various types, which are currently being tested.

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] Under-Secretary of War Johnson proposed in the Senate that the United States should store a minimum of one year's worth of military materials. Senators McNary and Lodge argued that the war debts owed to the U.S. by various countries in the previous war could be repaid in whole or in part with military materials. It was immediately resolved to ask President Roosevelt to discuss this with the debtor countries as soon as possible.

### British and Arab Representatives Hold Formal Meeting, Jewish Representatives Also Discuss the Policy of Talks with Britain

[Reuters, London, 1st] The British government delegation held a formal meeting with the Arab representatives once this afternoon. The Arab representatives issued a statement criticizing the British government's proposals as too broad and putting forward some other suggestions. The two sides have now decided to organize a small committee to study them. It is heard that the British members are Colonial Secretary MacDonald, Under-Secretary Butler, and Foreign Secretary Halifax, while two or three people from each of the Arab countries will attend.

[Reuters, London, 1st] According to Reuters, the Jewish delegation will hold a plenary meeting tonight to discuss the policy of continuing talks with Britain. The delegation has previously held talks with Jews in Palestine, foreign countries, and Poland. It is understood that the meeting will decide whether the delegation will continue to talk with Britain or adopt other methods.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] British Under-Secretary Butler replied in the House of Commons yesterday to a question about the McMahon letters, saying that the delay in publishing the documents was because the Arab representatives suggested modifying the translation, and they are currently considering it. If an agreement is reached, it will be announced immediately. Opposition MPs demanded that the original text of the letters be distributed to all those attending the Palestine Conference. The Under-Secretary replied that he would discuss the matter with Chamberlain.

### Hitler Is About to Fall, A U.S. Reporter's Speculation

[Associated Press, New York, 2nd] Reporter Von Wiegand recently published an article in the World Telegram here, declaring that Hitler will fall in a year or six months. Von Wiegand said that he met Hitler in 1921. At that time, Hitler often said that it was difficult to live forever. Recently, Hitler is still worried about his future.

### War Service, Finland Has Proposed a Bill

[Haitong Agency, Helsinki, 2nd] The Finnish government has resolved to submit to parliament a war-time national labor service bill. Its contents stipulate that all men and women between the ages of 18 and 60 must report to the Ministry of Defense when war breaks out and take up various military and morning work. Also, those who can serve in the National Defense Labor Service can undergo training for up to 60 days during peacetime.

### Britain Does Not Intend to Provide Economic Aid to Franco, France Announces General Pétain as Ambassador to the Franco Government

[Reuters, London, 1st] The British Under-Secretary declared in the House of Commons today that the British government has no intention of providing economic aid to Franco at present.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] In the House of Commons yesterday, Henderson asked whether the government would provide full protection to Spanish government leaders and their supporters who remain in the country for fear of retaliation. Under-Secretary Lloyd replied that the government is willing to maintain its traditional policy of granting asylum to refugees fleeing to Britain for reasons such as foreign politics and ethnicity, but the number of people who can be accommodated will be limited. However, if a method can be devised to maintain a certain number of Spanish government leaders and their supporters, the Home Office will give sympathetic attention to their asylum requests.

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] U.S. Senator Caraway, a Democrat, spoke in the Senate, advocating that the U.S. government should immediately take steps to recognize the Franco government. He mentioned the recognition of the Franco government by Britain and France, saying, "We should not damage our newly improved relations with South America merely because of foreign domestic issues."

[Central News Agency, Paris, 1st] Foreign Minister Bonnet attended the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives this afternoon and gave a report on various issues, including Hainan Island, Spain, Italy's territorial claims, Central and Eastern Europe, and the United States selling aircraft to France. The main points are as follows: Regarding the Spanish issue, Foreign Minister Bonnet first explained the French government's decision to recognize the Franco government, saying that Senator Bérard's talks with the Franco government authorities resulted in the signing of an agreement, and the two sides should establish good-neighborly relations. Franco sent a reply to the British and French governments, providing assurances on maintaining independence and not using retaliatory measures against Republican government personnel. It is heard that General Franco has issued a statement to the commander of the Italian volunteer army, saying that he wants the country's volunteer army to leave quickly. General Jordana, Foreign Minister of the Franco government, has also provided assurances to Bérard that Italian combatants will withdraw from Spain. As for the Republican government, some leaders and military commanders agree to immediately end the civil war. Regarding Italy's territorial claims, Britain and France maintain allied relations and are completely consistent in their attitude. This can be seen from the recent statements made to Parliament by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax. France is still prepared to reopen negotiations with Italy within the scope of the Franco-Italian Agreement of January 7, 1935. This position has not changed. Regarding the issue of Central and Eastern Europe, the situation in those places has improved, and the influence of France in Yugoslavia, Poland, and Romania has also increased. Polish Foreign Minister Beck recently met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and said that Poland remains committed to the Franco-Polish alliance. Foreign Minister Ciano's trip was unsuccessful, and the Italian government was quite disappointed. Regarding the issue of the United States selling a large number of aircraft to France, President Roosevelt's position is extremely important.

[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] It was officially announced here that General Pétain will be appointed as the first ambassador to the Franco government, and Foreign Minister Bonnet told the Foreign Affairs Committee that the French government is now making every effort to promote the end of the Spanish war.

[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] According to news here, French Foreign Minister Bonnet recently told the Foreign Affairs Committee that Franco had made a request to General Gambara, commander of the Italian army stationed in Spain, asking the Italian army to withdraw from Spain. Gambara then returned to Rome and asked Mussolini for instructions. So far, Italy has not given Franco a clear answer.

[Central News Agency, Burgos, 2nd] According to the National Army authorities, the French government has agreed to return all Spanish items stored in France, including cash stored in banks, military equipment purchased by the Republican government, merchant ships, documents, paintings, and all other state-owned property. As for the items forcibly sent to France for safekeeping by the Spanish government on July 18, 1936, they are also among those to be returned.

[Haitong Agency, Lisbon, 2nd] The Brazilian government instructed its envoy here to inform the Spanish envoy in Lisbon that Brazil has resolved to recognize the Franco government as the legitimate government of Spain. According to diplomatic sources, the Brazilian government took this step to notify General Franco because Brazil has no envoy in Burgos.

### Possible Paths of New International Crisis, Madame Tabouis's Startling Prediction, France Will Encounter Difficulties in the Far East

[Paris, 2nd] Madame Tabouis today published another startling prediction, adding a detailed analysis of the possible paths of a new international crisis. Madame Tabouis stated that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had indeed assured French Ambassador Coulondre that there would be no war this year, and that the demand for German colonies would not be made this year either. However, Madame Tabouis does not trust this guarantee. She believes that a new world crisis may still erupt, and its development should follow the following paths: The first step is Japan's threat to Indochina. France will encounter difficulties in dealing with the situation in the Far East. The second step is that Italy will incite riots in Tunisia and Djibouti in order to take the opportunity to threaten France and make demands. At the same time, the Arab and Muslim communities in British and French colonies will also be stirred up by the German and Italian axis and rise up against Britain and France. However, this plan will hardly succeed in Paris. The third step is that Germany will take the opportunity to make demands to Britain and France again, individually, on the condition of not assisting Italy. Its demands should be divided into two parts: First, Britain and France recognize the former German colonies; second, Britain and France engage in economic cooperation with Germany. People in Berlin believe that Britain and France will be able to quickly accept the above two demands in order to restrain Hitler's demands and those of Mussolini. In this way, the democratic countries will be forced to participate in the Second Munich Conference. Germany is very cunning. Its demands will not explicitly mention the recovery of former colonies, which is enough to arouse the common opposition of Britain, France, and Belgium. Germany will then make a broad colonial demand and use the psychology of mutual suspicion and sacrificing others among democratic countries to achieve its real goal of seizing colonies. Hitler and Mussolini have long been thinking and waiting for the time to come, and they have greatly expanded their military power in order to succeed once they threaten.

### Hitler's Executioner

— Translated by Shi Chang

——Head of the German Secret Police, Heinrich Himmler——

Yesterday, this newspaper published an article entitled "Undercurrents of the Nazi Government," discussing the conflict between the German Minister of Propaganda and the head of the secret police, Heinrich Himmler. We have already introduced Goebbels, and now we will briefly describe Himmler's biography to enlighten our readers. This article is excerpted and translated from the February issue of "Parade" magazine, written by Edmond Demaitre—Translator

In October 1919, a poorly dressed chauffeur with extremely poor eyesight entered the office of the "German War Flag" organization (Reichskriegsflagge) in Munich, seeking to see Colonel Röhm. When the obese colonel rose from his desk, the chauffeur, with his narrow eyes, stared and rushed over, saying, "My name is Heinrich Himmler, and I want to join your organization."

After the Great War in Europe, many revolutionary organizations emerged in Germany, and the "German War Flag" organization was one of them. At that time, the organization was in great need of members. Therefore, Himmler was easily admitted. Afterwards, Himmler attended all the meetings, listened quietly to his superiors' passionate speeches, and helped edit and distribute various propaganda pamphlets. Soon, he discovered that Röhm and his colleagues were on the wrong path and could not achieve great things.

Himmler's hobby was investigating and collecting materials about various people and events, including detailed and clear records about his colleagues, German political leaders, business organizations, and their principals. He was a patient newspaper reader and also paid attention to gossip from all walks of life. He knew the actresses favored by diplomatic envoys and the names and political views of newspaper publishers. Therefore, he obtained information from all aspects and busily organized, proofread, and edited in his small office, like a spider weaving a web.

The people under Colonel Röhm would never understand this taciturn and cautious man. Disrupting socialist gatherings was their favorite activity, and Himmler's reluctance to participate was often criticized. However, on the other hand, Himmler was a key figure, able to provide various important intelligence: the enemy's strength, the people's sympathy for the party's political views, possible police intervention during party gatherings, and the number of people involved. Although Himmler had such outstanding talent in this regard, he was not valued by his colleagues. Röhm decided to get rid of Himmler. Coincidentally, at that time, the leader of the German Nationalist Party, Strasser, needed a secretary, so he introduced Himmler. Unexpectedly, a few years later, his life would be buried at Himmler's hands.

Himmler's new boss was a dreamer who dreamed of national revolution but did not know how to proceed. He had branches in Berlin and Hamburg and often went there with Himmler to inspect them. In this way, Himmler's information became richer and richer. Soon, he also discovered that Strasser was definitely not the person who could lead the German revolution. One evening, he happened to attend a gathering of the National Socialist German Workers' Party in Munich and heard a speech by a man named Hitler. The speech was inspiring, emotionally charged, and vehemently criticized Jews, socialists, and democrats, just like Göring and Goebbels. Himmler was moved by the speech of the future German leader, so he joined Hitler's National Socialist Party on the spot.

This was a great man with a bright future, worth following. At the same time, Hitler also discovered that Himmler was a talented person. Hitler had too many fools under him, and here he finally found a practical talent with organizational skills, an ideal party secretary.

Before Hitler seized power, Himmler was a key member of the National Socialist Party who worked diligently behind the scenes, supervising the organizations of the National Socialist Party in various places and compiling important documents about the biographies of party members and enemies. He faithfully followed his superior. After the National Socialist Party came to power, he organized the famous Hitler Guard, whose members were strictly vetted and had to be of pure Teutonic ethnicity, with relatively attractive skin and hair. The eugenics research institute was engaged in investigation work. Gradually, Himmler established Germany's terrifying police organization, strictly suppressing activities against the National Socialist Party. The famous purge movement in 1934 was presided over by Himmler. In June of the same year, he announced a conspiracy of rebellion within the party to Hitler, publishing a list of traitors, totaling 397 people, including famous figures such as Röhm, Heines, Ernst, and Schleicher. They, along with hundreds of others, were executed; at the same time, thousands more were imprisoned in terrible concentration camps.

Germany's secret police organization is very strict. Himmler can boast that the actions of all Germans cannot escape his eyes. Secret agents are scattered in every corner. Of course, the private lives of officers are what they pay the most attention to.

Himmler is Hitler's protector and also Hitler's executioner.

Short Comment

### The Fury of Osaka

An armory near Osaka, Japan, suddenly exploded on the 28th of last month, and the fire spread, lasting until the 2nd of this month. Now the Japanese government has sent a large number of army engineering teams and a battalion of infantry to the disaster area in Osaka to cooperate with 2,000 soldiers and police from the 16th Division of the Nishijin District and firefighters to carry out firefighting. From this tense situation, it can be seen that the fire was serious.

Now the truth about the cause of the fire is unknown. We certainly cannot rashly say that this major explosion in the armory was an eruption of the Japanese people's anti-war sentiment, and the truth of the event may be forever "strictly prohibited from publication," leaving people forever "baffled." However, we should at least recognize: First, in Japan, which claims to have the most stringent national organization and police system, in Japan, where wartime security has been completed for 20 months of war, such a major explosion and tragedy occurred in such an armory in Japan. Even if it is not the eruption of the people's anti-war anger, the responsibility should fall on the neglect of the person in charge of the armory! Second, the areas near Osaka are usually the largest industrial area for the Japanese army. During the war, it was also the site for the manufacture of munitions and the terminal for transporting munitions to China. From this explosion tragedy, we can infer the seriousness of the internal crisis of the Japanese × invading army in the future.

We have no schadenfreude. We only mourn for this, mourning the Japanese invaders' disguised pride in victory, mourning their "anti-communist peace" being plotted with traitors, mourning the inevitable disillusionment of the "peace" fantasies of general blind followers!

The fire of anti-aggression is about to spread across the three islands of Fusang, preparing to greet the final victory with more heroic struggles!

### British Far East Policy

After Britain and France recognized the rebel government in the west, traitorous newspapers and some pessimists once again chanted the old tune of "the disintegration of the peace front, and China should urgently cease war and be pro-Japanese." We have sharply criticized their absurdity, and said that the evolution of the situation, namely the policy of compromise and concession, will not only increase the arrogance of the aggressor and the crisis of the country's war, but also promote the contradiction between the aggressor and the compromiser. The rampage of the Japanese × in the Far East is a clear example. It is also an inevitable trend that the Central Law will reach the maximum extent of concession.

On March 1, the British Upper House debated the situation in China, and Foreign Under-Secretary Pymouth reiterated Britain's Far East policy, insisting on the Nine-Power Treaty and safeguarding China's territorial integrity and sovereignty. The decision on aid will be seriously considered; this can be regarded as a statement that British political illness has retreated to the maximum extent. This statement is naturally enough to strike a blow to the "cease war and surrender to Japan" theories of those traitorous newspapers and pessimists, but at the same time we must know: (1) Our war of resistance is based on the position of "self-reliance" and strives to win foreign aid. It is difficult for traitorous newspapers and pessimists to use the policies of a few rulers as a reason for their surrender to Japan and betrayal of the country, but discerning people will never trust them. (2) The situation of Japan in the Far East powers will become increasingly serious, regardless of the attitude of the powers, and our international situation will inevitably become more and more favorable.

In addition to the × government's personal apology to Sir Slyke, the British ambassador to Tokyo, Ando, the × Commander-in-Chief of South China Invasion, personally sent his chief of staff, Tanaka, to Hong Kong to personally apologize to the Governor of Hong Kong and be responsible for discussing compensation issues. × Representative Tanaka paid a formal apology to the Governor of Hong Kong yesterday morning, and discussed compensation issues with the Chief Secretary in the afternoon. It is believed that the Luohu incident can be satisfactorily resolved next week.

It is learned that × Chief Representative Tanaka arrived in Hong Kong by boat from Guangzhou yesterday morning. At about 9 a.m., accompanied by × Acting Consul Yokota, he went to the Governor's Mansion to pay a formal apology to the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Loftus. Tanaka first stated that the × side's responsible person was extremely uneasy about the Luohu bombing incident, which disturbed the law and order of the place under British rule, and offered his apologies. The Governor replied that he first praised Tanaka's arrival, and then said that the × side's attitude was admirable. After some small talk and light refreshments, Tanaka retired.

Subsequently Meets with the Chief Secretary to Discuss Compensation

Regarding the compensation issue, × Representative Tanaka and Chief Secretary Smith began negotiations yesterday afternoon. It is learned that the negotiation location was in the office of Chief Secretary Smith in the Chief Secretary's Office on Garden Road. At 2:15 p.m. yesterday afternoon, × Acting Consul Yokota accompanied Tanaka to formally meet with Mr. Smith, the Chief Secretary. After some greetings in the office, they went to a certain place to discuss compensation issues.

The meeting lasted about two hours and ended satisfactorily.

Satisfactory Resolution of Compensation for Various Losses

During the consultation, the British side first put the various reports on the Luohu bombing on the table. The × Representative also submitted the report made by × Acting Consul Yokota, and they reviewed each other. The compensation issue was discussed separately for property losses and loss of life.

In addition to Smith and Tanaka, there were only × Acting Consul Yokota and two confidential secretaries. The meeting was adjourned at about 4 p.m. It is learned that the result of yesterday afternoon's meeting was only a small conclusion, and both parties had to ask their superiors for instructions before they could resolve everything.

Hong Kong Government Officially Announces This Incident

Regarding Tanaka's audience with the Governor and discussion of compensation issues with the Chief Secretary, Hong Kong has officially announced that the announcement was issued by Chief Secretary Smith himself at 2:15 p.m. yesterday afternoon. The original text is translated as follows: Japanese Major General Tanaka paid a formal visit to the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Loftus, yesterday morning, representing General Ando, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in South China, to express his apologies for the Luohu bombing incident in the New Territories. The Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Loftus, replied that he was very pleased that General Ando could personally order his Chief of Staff, Major General Tanaka, to come to Hong Kong to express his apologies. He was also pleased to hear that the British and Japanese governments had reached a satisfactory resolution on this incident. As for how the Japanese side should compensate for the loss of life and property in the British border area of Luohu caused by the bombs dropped by Japanese aircraft, Major General Tanaka and Chief Secretary Smith will discuss everything together yesterday afternoon.

According to the second announcement by Chief Secretary Smith, the Chief Secretary, together with the Police Commissioner, the Director of the Kowloon-Canton Railway Bureau, and Colonel Nivy Road, discussed the compensation issue for the bombing incident on the 21st of last month with × Resident Consul Yokota and × Chief of Staff Tanaka and his staff yesterday afternoon. A satisfactory agreement has been reached on the amount of compensation. Although the exact amount has not been disclosed, the × side has agreed to a maximum of 20,000 yuan.

### The Case of the Attack on Lin Bosheng Was Formally Tried Yesterday　Chen Xilin Was Identified as the Murderer　Four Witnesses Testified to the Circumstances of the Murder They Witnessed　Lin Attended Court for the First Time, the Defendant Remained Calm

Lin Bosheng, a Central Legislative Committee member who was stripped of his post for signing and issuing a pro-peace telegram on behalf of Wang, and the general manager of the Hong Kong branch of the South China Japanese Daily, was attacked at 4 p.m. on January 17 this year on Des Voeux Road Central, suffering multiple serious head injuries and immediately collapsing to the ground. The situation at the time of the incident was very chaotic. A British soldier happened to be passing by and arrested Chen Xilin, a painter, and handed him over to the police station. The injured was sent to the hospital for treatment. The next day, the suspect Chen Xilin was brought before Central Magistrate Mr. Hua Yishi and charged with two counts: (1) injuring Lin Bosheng's body with intent to murder on Des Voeux Road Central on January 17; (2) injuring Lin Bosheng with intent to injure or disable another person's limbs. The case has been brought to court several times. Due to the injury not healing, the case was postponed until 2:30 p.m. yesterday for formal trial, and the prosecution was changed to Deputy Government Attorney Williams. The plaintiff Lin Bosheng extended the service of lawyer Shi Luohua, and the defendant Chen Xilin extended the service of lawyer Shi Cishi for defense. Lin attended court for the first time yesterday, wearing a blue silk cotton robe with a bandage on his right heel, indicating that the injury had not yet healed. The defendant Chen Xilin remained calm and paid close attention to the plaintiff. The plaintiff also paid close attention to him from time to time. The case happened to occur after Wang Jingwei advocated the announcement of the Yan telegram, and the general public believed that it had political implications and paid attention to it. The number of people attending the hearing yesterday afternoon was more crowded than the previous court hearing, and there was almost no space in the courtroom. In addition to the description of the case by the chief prosecuting attorney, those who were called to testify included Dr. Ge of the Mary Hospital, the plaintiff Lin Bosheng, Dr. Hua of the Mary Hospital, and Manager Za Bianchen of the Lao Jinlong Foreign Company. At 4:25 p.m., the court granted the request of the chief prosecuting attorney and postponed the case for continued hearing on the afternoon of the 6th of this month. The testimony of the witnesses is recorded as follows.

Suddenly Attacked and Injured, Collapsed to the Ground

After the court opened, Williams first stated the case to the court, saying that at about 5 p.m. on January 17 this year, Lin Bosheng, the general manager of the South China Daily on 49 Hollywood Road, went downstairs from the Zhongtian Building and walked west along the sidewalk. When he reached the front of the Mackintosh Company, he turned onto the avenue. Without warning, he suddenly felt a violent blow to his head and collapsed to the ground, unaware of what happened afterwards. Fortunately, Lin was wearing a felt hat at the time, which resisted much of the force of the blow. At this time, Dr. Hua was just coming out of the Lane Crawford Company and heading towards his own car. Suddenly, he heard a commotion on the road and saw a Chinese man running west quickly. He also saw a man beside the plaintiff, holding an iron awl and hitting his "occiput" three times before running away immediately.

During the Interception, the Suspect Was Arrested

At the same time, a Westerner named Luo Bianchen rushed forward to chase him. The plaintiff ran past the Dianjun Road, between the Sergeant Major Hotel and the 　Ben Buddha. Luo Bianchen 　caught up with the defendant, and a member of the military medical team, Boots, rushed to the scene and intercepted him, bringing him back to the scene for police investigation. Dr. Hua, in the chaos, returned to the Caraver Company and telegraphed the police station and ambulance team to ask them to come to the scene. After a while, Dr. Hua returned to the scene and saw the plaintiff lying in a pool of blood. Another hammer was dropped about three feet away from him, and a strip of iron was found more than a foot away from the tram track. At the same time, the defendant was tightly held by Assistant He Jian. Dr. Hua recognized this person as the man who had beaten the plaintiff with a hammer. Then the ambulance team arrived and took the injured to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, the police detectives handed the recovered iron rod and iron strip to Assistant Yun for filing. At this time, the police did not know the name of the injured person. It was only learned afterwards that when the defendant was arrested, his confession only said "I have nothing to say." The plaintiff's right eye is still affected, and the felt hat he wore that day helped a lot.

Fortunately, There Was a Felt Hat for Protection

After speaking, Dr. Guni of the Mary Hospital took the stand and testified, and was questioned by Attorney Wei. According to the answer, "At about 6 p.m. on January 17 this year, Lin Bosheng was taken to the hospital, and I treated him. I saw a scar half an inch above his right eyebrow, about an inch and a half long. The eyelid was bruised and black. When I looked at it with an × light, I found that his eye socket was sunken and had been broken. There were also scars on his forehead, and three wounds on his 'occiput', in a semi-circle. Lin was conscious when he was admitted to the hospital and stayed in the hospital until February 16, when he was discharged. But his right eye is still affected, because the nerves and muscles in his eye have been injured. As for what could cause this scar, I think the person who hit him must have used a hard object. There are as many as six scars on the injured person's head, but his brain has not been injured. The felt hat presented in court really provided a lot of protection. The plaintiff is now fine."

Lin Recalls the Situation

After the testimony, the plaintiff Lin Bosheng took the stand and testified, and was questioned by Attorney Wei. According to the answer, "I am the founder of the South China Daily on 49 Hollywood Road and the current general manager. At 5 p.m. on January 17 this year, I went downstairs from the Zhongtian Building and wanted to return to the South China Newspaper Office. When I walked out of the bottom of the arcade and onto the road, I suddenly felt someone attacking me from behind and from the side. After continuing for two steps, I collapsed to the ground. I remember touching my eyes with my hands and feeling blood flowing, and vaguely hearing a Western woman calling for an 'ambulance team'. The felt hat in the courtroom is the one I wore on the day of the incident. It was very complete that day and not broken. As for the defendant in the criminal's cage, I have never met him and do not know him at all." After the testimony, Dr. Hua took the stand and testified. According to the answer, "I am a radiation surgery doctor at the Mary Hospital. At 4 p.m. on January 17 this year, I came out of the Lane Crawford Company and was about to step into the car. Suddenly I heard a noise, so I looked up and saw a person running wildly to the right of the road. In an instant, he disappeared and could not be seen again. Then I saw a man lying on the ground, and was leaning over to his side, holding a hammer in his hand, and hitting him three times. I always thought that the man would not die immediately, but would inevitably have his head broken."

The Evidence Will Be Collected and the Hearing Will Continue on the 6th

After the defendant finished hitting, he threw the hammer in his hand two or three steps away from the plaintiff and ran to the southwest. I hurriedly returned to the Lane Crawford Company and briefly told the police the situation by telephone. After that, I went to the scene and saw that the defendant had been arrested by Assistant He Jian. The situation I saw was very clear." The defendant's lawyer, Shi Cishi, stood up and questioned, "Can you identify the defendant when you recognized the criminal?" The answer was "This is not possible." After the answer, Robinson, the department manager of the Keller Wine Department, took the stand and testified. According to the answer, "On January 17 this year, I had just finished work and walked out of the Mackintosh Company arcade. I was shocked to see a man squatting down and holding a hammer, and violently attacking a man lying on the ground, hitting him on the head three times. I shouted for him to stop. The defendant heard this and ran away, and threw the hammer on the ground. So I chased him closely. When he reached the intersection of the Sergeant Major Hotel and the Lane Crawford Lane, the defendant hesitated left and right, pretending to want to enter but not daring to enter. At this time, I was about five yards away from the defendant. I still shouted for help. In this tense situation, the defendant was suddenly grabbed and held tightly by Boots, a member of the military medical team, and brought back to the scene. When the police arrived, they were handed over to 　　Assistant to take care of him." 　Wei　 said to the court, "There are still several witnesses who may appear in court next time." The court ordered the case to be postponed for continued hearing at 2:30 p.m. on the 6th of this month.

### The Housing Problem Is Becoming Increasingly Serious: Demand for Public Housing in Hong Kong and Kowloon Exceeds Supply by More Than Five Times. The Emergency Relief Committee Will Find Ways to Continue Construction.

Hong Kong has limited land and a large population, making housing a critical issue that has become increasingly severe since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Recognizing this, the authorities are striving to remedy the situation. Last autumn, they proposed building public housing in North Point, Seven Sisters, and King's Park, Kowloon, to accommodate residents unable to pay high rents. The Emergency Relief Committee was entrusted with this task, and a total of forty units have been completed. Interior work, such as installing electricity and plumbing, still requires several days. The Emergency Relief Committee convened a meeting of representatives at 9:00 AM yesterday to discuss the opening of these forty public housing units and the admission procedures. Attendees included Father Lai Yi-en, Huang Mao-lin, and others. The meeting thoroughly discussed the selection of households for the public housing. The committee issued over four hundred application forms to those requesting housing, and selection will be based on the degree of difficulty in their living situations. Currently, over two hundred forms have been received. The first selection included seventeen Category A applications and twenty-six Category B applications, with the remainder in Category C. Category A applicants are considered the highest priority. The public housing is scheduled to officially open on the 15th of this month. According to a representative of the Emergency Relief Committee, only forty units have been built, while over two hundred people have applied, resulting in demand exceeding supply. In this situation, many residents will undoubtedly face housing difficulties that remain unresolved. Therefore, there is a need to continue building more public housing. The Emergency Relief Committee will try to proceed with this within possible limits, but a decision will be made based on the situation and environment after the existing forty units are opened.

### The Authorities Are Building Magnificent New Barracks on Waterloo Road in Kowloon, with Construction Costs Reaching HK$16 Million, and Contractors Will Be Invited Next Month to Complete the Project Within Eighteen Months.

As the situation in the Far East becomes increasingly tense, the British authorities are actively strengthening their military deployment to safeguard Hong Kong's lifeline in the Far East. In addition to dispatching troops and warships to Hong Kong for joint defense, they plan to reclaim land and build magnificent new barracks northeast of Waterloo Road in Kowloon Tong. This plan has now been drafted and approved by the London authorities. The initial phase of the project will cost approximately HK$16 million and is scheduled to invite contractors in London and Hong Kong in April of this year. The London War Office will review the proposals, and construction will begin once the terms are finalized.

A Site Spanning Seven Million Square Yards

The entire barracks construction project is estimated to take eighteen months to complete. Approximately six thousand workers will be employed. The site covers approximately seven million square yards and will include one hundred and forty buildings, including barracks, military headquarters, schools, and factories. In addition to leveling an area two hundred yards wide and six hundred yards long alongside Waterloo Road, the project will expand eastward by four hundred yards. The construction plan is divided into three parts: (1) officer residences located along Waterloo Road, with hockey fields, tennis courts, and parade grounds; (2) barracks for Hong Kong and Singapore troops located two hundred yards west of Waterloo Road; and (3) mule stables located two hundred yards west of the barracks. Once completed, the Sham Shui Po and Whitfield Barracks will be decommissioned. A western road will be built between Prince Edward Road and Waterloo Road, leading directly to the new barracks. The first section will extend several hundred yards west, then turn north, splitting into two roads, one leading to the new barracks and the other to future development areas.

New Mountain-Moving Method Saves Labor

Furthermore, considering that the area is near mountainous regions and there is a risk of poisonous mosquitoes, the authorities will dig an underground channel to drain sewage and prevent it from accumulating, thus avoiding the breeding of mosquitoes. However, various anti-malaria measures will be implemented without hindering the irrigation of local farmers. As for the mountain-moving work, a new method of water flushing will be adopted, using seawater to vigorously wash down from the mountaintop, gradually dispersing the soil and accumulated stones. A small embankment, approximately six inches high, will be built at the foot of the mountain to block the accumulated soil. Once the soil reaches the embankment, another embankment will be built. This process will transform the rugged mountain into a flat platform suitable for construction. This method is extremely simple and saves labor.

### A Night Soil Worker Was Robbed of His Cash and Then Brutally Beaten by a Chinese Detective and a European Officer. Magistrate Forsaith Criticized This and Requested the Police Department to Conduct a Public Inquiry.

Zhang Sa, a 33-year-old man, was previously accused by British Detective Hathersich before Magistrate Forsaith at the Central Magistracy of robbing night soil worker Mao Rong of $2.60 in cash near Johnston Road on the morning of February 1. The defendant was defended by barrister Reedie, who pleaded not guilty. The case was heard again by Forsaith yesterday afternoon. After the testimony of various witnesses, the defendant was acquitted due to the prosecution's insufficient evidence.

The Plaintiff Was Violently Beaten by a Chinese Detective

However, the plaintiff testified in court yesterday that in addition to affirming that the defendant had robbed him of his cash, he had been brutally beaten by a Chinese detective after being taken to the police station, resulting in undeserved injuries. Later, Constable Lu Mo, who arrested the defendant, testified that he saw the defendant suddenly being beaten by a Chinese detective, which he found strange. He stated that after the plaintiff and defendant arrived at the police station, he saw a Chinese detective, following the order of the British superintendent, take the plaintiff into a small room. Suddenly, he heard the plaintiff crying out loudly in the room, "Woe is me!" The sound was horrifying and clearly audible even from the outside of the police station. Later, when he saw the plaintiff's face, his right hand was handcuffed, and the other hand was chained to a bedpost.

The Judge Criticized the Illegal Actions of the Chinese Detective

Forsaith stated that the Chinese detectives in the police station are public servants who should handle matters fairly and according to the law, and should not arbitrarily beat people. Furthermore, the police station and the Hong Kong government are official institutions, and such unfortunate and unexpected incidents of the plaintiff being beaten should not occur in the station. He strongly criticized this and said that if similar incidents occur again, it will erode people's trust in clear rewards and punishments, law, and justice. Moreover, if the plaintiff is subjected to such illegal torture while accusing someone in the police station, the treatment of the defendant would be even more unimaginable. He strongly hoped that the police authorities would address this unexpected incident of the plaintiff being beaten by

Holding a Public Inquiry to Investigate the Culprit

convene all witnesses as soon as possible to conduct a study or, better yet, a public inquiry to determine who is responsible, so that this unexpected incident can be brought to the attention of the public. Finally, Forsaith told British Detective Hathersich to convey this message to his superiors, urging them to conduct a study of the incident promptly. Even if a public inquiry cannot be held due to circumstances, all sworn testimonies should be submitted to the government's legal officer for review.

### Special Report from Our Newspaper

The long-awaited "Flying Hotel" – the first Boeing Clipper – is finally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong at noon today. After eagerly anticipating its arrival, the people of Hong Kong will be able to look up at the blue sky at noon today and catch a glimpse of the magnificent giant bird, which should be a source of great comfort. Unfortunately, it can only stay here for a short day before flying back to the United States, and the originally planned opportunity for everyone to visit and admire it has disappeared. Those with "Hong Kong dollars" will naturally still have the chance to enjoy a flight, but those who are walking on the road will only be able to sigh at the clouds.

Ancient people had the beautiful tale of sleepwalking, but they could not touch even a shadow of it, and dreams could not be started. Here, the reporter has collected some materials to give a brief account of the Boeing aircraft, introducing it to those who wish to dream about it.

Saying that the Boeing is an airplane is a bit hard to believe. In any case, saying that it is a house, a "flying hotel," is not an exaggeration. It has five layers of wide rooms, accommodating seventy-four guests without feeling crowded. Bedrooms, living rooms, smoking rooms, dining rooms, reading rooms, it has everything.

The most interesting thing is the equipment in its "honeymoon suite." It is a not-so-large room, with all the arrangements the same as the bridal chamber of a typical "wedding night." Inside, you and your lover can spend a quiet and sweet journey like at home.

All of the rooms have the latest equipment, which is much more advanced than that of any "President" or "Queen" class ships currently sailing the ocean. All the equipment is painted in light green, cyan, and sky blue, which allows people traveling at high altitudes to maintain a calm and elegant mood.

The cost of a Boeing aircraft is one million US dollars, which is equivalent to 3.5 million Hong Kong dollars!

It began manufacturing thirty-five years ago in North Carolina, USA, and its drawings and various parts were designed separately by 340 experts from various departments. Think about it, it is the crystallization of the hard work of 340 people!

After thirty-seven years of careful design and manufacturing, it was finally completed this year and ascended to the throne of the aviation fleet.

The amount of oil in the Boeing's fuel tanks can supply an ordinary car to circle the earth two and a half times. Its volume is two and a half times larger than that of an ordinary clipper, and four engines can generate a thousand horsepower. The air circulation equipment in the aircraft is also state-of-the-art.

On many ordinary aircraft, we know that passengers can only look out at the sky from the windows of the plane, but the Boeing has a deck of 263 square feet, just like on a sailing ship, allowing passengers to stroll around and admire the mountain scenery and flowing clouds at will.

On the upper deck, there is also a new piece of equipment that the aviation industry considers to be a major success in recent years, which is the "single-arm chair." This chair is fully installed on that deck. When unfolded, it is comfortable to sit on, but when folded down, the deck remains a deck.

The Boeing's real name will be officially named the Cathay (meaning China) Clipper when it returns to the United States for commercial operation. Its weight is no less than 83,000 pounds - not including passenger items, its top speed is 210 miles per hour.

Well, the outline of the first Boeing Clipper has been described here. When it arrives in Hong Kong this afternoon and has not yet landed at Kai Tak Airport, it will fly around Hong Kong and Kowloon for a week. If you are interested, look up at the sky at noon today and wait for it to fly over.

### The Japanese Marines Captured Nanao Yesterday; Our Troops Withdrew to the Mountains of Longao, Holding Firmly to the Defenses; Japanese Movements Were Frequent in Shilong and Wancheng in Dongjiang.

[Shantou Express News] At around 9:00 AM on the 1st, three Japanese planes attacked Shantou in two waves, dropping six bombs on the railway station, causing slight damage to the tracks. Traffic was restored this morning. Furthermore, over 600 Japanese marines landed in Nanao on the evening of the 1st. Over a thousand of our police and guerrillas fiercely resisted. The battle was extremely intense. The Japanese repeatedly attempted to land forcefully, but were repelled by our machine gun teams, suffering over a hundred casualties. We also suffered considerable losses. Subsequently, a large Japanese reinforcement arrived. To avoid losses, we withdrew into the mountains of Longao, holding firmly to the defenses and still confronting the Japanese.

[Shenzhen Express News] The Japanese troops stationed in Shilong originally numbered about a thousand, with two shallow-water warships and dozens of speedboats docked on the river. However, yesterday, the 28th, the Japanese troops in Shilong suddenly moved most of their forces toward Shitan. All military equipment and supplies were also moved. The Japanese frequently moved and declared that the remaining civilians must move far away, and completely destroyed the Guangyuan Road iron bridge south of Shilong, including all bridge piers. The intention is unclear. Currently, only a few Japanese troops are stationed in Shilong. In Wancheng, some Japanese troops were also transferred to Humen and Taiping. Therefore, in the past two days, no unusual movements have been observed in Shilong and Wancheng. Our villagers have actively participated in guerrilla warfare to strengthen their self-defense against the Japanese and assist the regular army in combat. Therefore, the defensive strength on both sides of the Dongjiang River is currently very strong. It will be difficult for the Japanese to expand their incursions.

### Those Who Escaped from Under the Iron Heel Talk About the Recent Situation in Guangzhou; The Japanese Hide Their Weak Strength with Various Tricks; The City Is a World of Thieves Where Bandits and Police Are Indistinguishable.

[Jiangmen Express News] It has been more than four months since Guangzhou fell. Although the Japanese have made various efforts to lure our people back to the city, the Japanese troops are undisciplined and corrupt, killing and plundering the people at will. Furthermore, local bandits and ruffians are rampant in the city, looting and plundering, and property and lives are not guaranteed. Therefore, people are reluctant to return. To this day, the entire Guangzhou remains a dead city with no prosperity to speak of. A gentleman who recently escaped from Guangzhou and arrived in Jiangmen told us in great detail about the recent situation in Guangzhou. Here is a description: The gentleman first stated that

Recently, the majority of the Japanese troops in Guangzhou have been ordered to transfer to the front lines of Dongjiang and Hainan for combat. The military strength in the city is extremely weak. However, to conceal their weak forces, they must send three to two hundred people every morning, divided into several teams, departing from the Finance Office on Shuihan Road and patrolling back and forth on various major roads, pretending to have just arrived from Japan. In fact, all of those going back and forth all day are this batch of Japanese soldiers. If you pay a little attention, you can see that. The city also sees three to several dozen Japanese giant transport vehicles tightly covered with canvas every day, frequently traveling back and forth, either from east to west or from west to east. Those who have just returned to the urban area believe that the Japanese army is busy with military transport and never stops, and that their military strength must be extremely strong. In fact, it is also a cunning trick to conceal the truth, similar to the frequent movements of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army in the city is extremely afraid of our attacks due to the lurking and active presence of our guerrilla and plainclothes teams.

After 5:00 PM, they retreat to the suburbs or hide in various agencies and dare not go out. Currently, the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters is located in the former Japanese Police Station on Weixin Road, and the Naval Headquarters is located in the former Japanese Naval Headquarters on Nantidi. The other major hotels in Xihaioukou, such as Aiqun, Xinhua, Xinya, and White House, have been occupied by the Japanese. The Xinhua Hotel has been occupied by the Japanese army as a military club. However, the furniture and fixtures of the major hotels have mostly been shipped away by the Japanese. As for the situation in the city, it remains desolate.

Although some citizens have been forced by circumstances to risk returning to the city in the past month or two, and there is a slight crowding, their actions and residence are always subject to unexpected beatings and searches by the Japanese army. Therefore, there are quite a few people who return and then flee again. In the city, in addition to the large number of opium dens and gambling houses, some barber shops and restaurants, such as Jinlun, Jinlong, and Dasanyuan on Changdi, Luyu Ju on Taiping Road, Taotao Ju on Dishipu, and Huirulou on Huiai Road, have been forced to reopen, but they are still very empty. Shops are in a difficult situation, unable to decide whether to open or close. Other legitimate businesses have completely shut down. The entire city remains a dead city to this day. In particular, the chaotic security and frequent robberies are even more terrifying.

After the Japanese army retreats and hides at night, the police and security teams of the puppet government only have one stick each to use as a weapon, and their members are complex, with no distinction between bandits and police. Therefore, gunshots suddenly erupt after sunset, and robbing homes, killing people, and stealing goods occur dozens of times every night. The entire Guangzhou is completely a world of bandits. Even those with the greatest courage are in constant fear for their safety and have no choice but to flee. In addition, in order to count the number of people entering and leaving the city every day, the Japanese have set up a kind of permit issuing office at the land and water transportation intersections in Henan and the northeastern suburbs. All citizens entering and leaving must obtain this so-called "Good Citizen Certificate" before being allowed to enter or leave. However, it is easier to obtain a certificate to enter the city, while there are many obstacles to leaving, often making it impossible to get one's wish. This is also a point that those who want to return to Guangzhou should pay attention to.

### The Southwestern Eight Provinces Joint Transportation Is Implemented; From Now On, Transportation of Special Products from Various Provinces Will Be Convenient; Wartime Economic Activities Can Be Developed

[Shaoguan News] Since the Japanese invasion, our access channels have been blocked, national ships cannot travel, and we can only rely on foreign ships for transportation, which is often harassed by the Japanese, causing transportation costs to rise daily. As a result, commodity prices are extremely high, and the development of the wartime economy has suffered a major blow. Since the fall of Guangzhou, transportation between the province and Hong Kong has been cut off, making transportation even more difficult. In order to facilitate foreign trade and stimulate wartime economic activity, our authorities have promoted land transportation as a remedy, actively opening up highways in the southwestern eight provinces to establish close connections. Now the highways of the eight provinces have been fully completed, and the transportation authorities have drafted joint transportation measures for Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, establishing transportation and trade companies to be responsible for transporting goods and promoting the sales of special products in order to enrich the local economy. Various preparations for the transportation of the eight provinces have been completed and implemented in the middle of last month. From now on, overseas travel in the southwest will be more convenient.

### Amidst Tense Military Transportation, Yaoming Highway Is Repaired and Open to Traffic

[Heshan Express News] The Yaoming Highway from Gaoming to Gaoyao, the central section of the Guangfu Highway, was previously destroyed by order of the authorities. Recently, our army has gathered in preparation for a counteroffensive. To facilitate the transportation of goods, the military authorities have ordered the authorities of the two counties to repair it as soon as possible. After half a month of effort, the entire road has been repaired and widened. Transportation vehicles weighing up to seven tons can pass without obstruction. Now the goods of the two counties can be exchanged in the short term, which is of great benefit to the rural economy.

### Central Government Issues Instructions to Rectify Military Discipline Nationwide; Commanders of the Fourth War Zone Have Been Ordered to Ensure Compliance

[Shaoguan News] Our Supreme Commander Chiang Kai-shek believes that military discipline throughout the country should be strictly rectified after the start of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance. Special rectification provisions have been issued to the Ministry of Military Affairs and ordered to the commanders of each province and war zone to strictly implement them. All military personnel, whether in training in the rear, new recruits who have not returned to their units, or new and old officers and soldiers fighting on the front lines, should be required to comply. Zhang Fakui, commander of the Fourth War Zone here, has been ordered to instruct the disciplinary inspection teams and military police units under his command to conduct strict inspections.

### The Rice Shortage in Chaoshan Is Slightly Eased; One Million Dan of Rice Is Transported In; The Ministry of Finance Has Approved Tax Exemption; The Authorities Prevent Manipulation and Hoarding

[Shantou Express News] The rice shortage in Chaoshan is serious. After officials and merchants repeatedly telegraphed requesting exemption from import taxes on foreign rice, Commander Zhang and Chairman Li forwarded the request to the central government for approval. According to reliable information, the Ministry of Finance has indeed approved tax-free import of one million dan of foreign rice into Chaoshan, to be freely transported by various parties. Special Commissioner Chunfan arrived in Shantou from Chaozhou yesterday to meet with Mayor Wu Qi and convene business leaders to solicit opinions on how to prevent manipulation and hoarding, fundamentally stabilize rice prices, and benefit the common people.

### Dongjiang Reporters Organize the Dongjiang Branch of the Youth Journalists Association

[Dongjiang News] The Dongjiang River basin is at the forefront of southeastern Guangdong and is of utmost importance in military and political terms. Therefore, after the recovery of Huizhou, Boluo, and Dongguan, war reporters from various places gathered in Dongjiang to work. Previously, due to a lack of communication, it was difficult to maximize work efficiency, and business convenience was often hindered. Li Rouzhi, Xia Shi, Luo Keyao, Zhu Guorui, Lan Jinfang, Gu Bowei, Xu Fei, Liu Rong, Ren Gan, Peng Tainong, Lin Wei, Huang Yuexian, Zeng Yonger, Chen Yuanying, Hainan, Rao Qiuyun, and others felt deeply that colleagues in Dongjiang urgently needed to establish close contact in order to strengthen work efficiency. Therefore, they held a meeting on the 26th of last month and decided to organize the Dongjiang Branch of the China Youth Journalists Association. Luo Keyao, Gu Bowei, and Chen Yuanying were immediately appointed as organizers to be responsible for carrying out preparations, soliciting members, and reporting to the Southern Office of the Guilin Headquarters. The preparatory office is temporarily located at the Huizhou Minguo Daily News Agency. The association plans to be established around March 15.

To get from Yitou to Hengyang, you can take a small steamer from Wenzhou to Qingtian, transfer to a long-distance bus to Jinhua, and then transfer to a direct train to Hengyang on the Zhe-Gan-Han-Xiang-Gui line. However, there are very few ships from Shantou to Wenzhou. You can first go to Shanghai and transfer to a ship to Wenzhou. The total travel cost is about 70 national currency, and it takes about 10 days.

2. The traffic situation on that section is unknown.

3. The ordinary third-class passenger ticket on the Heng-Gui section of the Xiang-Gui Railway costs 5.25 national currency per person.

Answer to Mr. Chen Tianqi's questions:

1. Due to a lack of funds, I heard that there are refugee ships from Hong Kong to Shanghai that can waive shipping costs. Is this true?

Answer:

1. We have not recently heard of any organizations operating free refugee ships to Shanghai.

### Returning from Pingshan, Jinan District (Continued)

A Thrilling Evening and Night Party

During our rest, in that quiet and pleasant school campus, those robust and spirited men began their evening meal. They all squatted on the ground, their food served on iron plates divided into three sections, containing two kinds of very light white rice and soybeans. They ate coarse red rice, six or seven people in a group, the team members and the captain treated equally, showing that there was no class distinction in the guerrilla隊.

Mr. Zeng Sheng, the General Captain of the Yinghui People's Assault Team, is a calm, rational, and powerful man. He wore a yellow military uniform without a belt, carried a "walking stick," and took us to the Pingshan Township Office, the "July 7th Memorial Platform" for a mass meeting, and made a tour of their other First Unit, Second Unit, and other places. When passing through the residences of the villagers along the way, not a single villager failed to treat Mr. Zeng with warmth and respect, showing the people's love for them.

As the pleasant and gentle evening gradually turned into a dark night, we returned to Pingshan School. A rich dinner was prepared to treat us. Thinking of their own soybeans and simple meals, we felt very ashamed, and it was also evident that they respected those who came to comfort them.

A burst of heroic voices came from the dark corridor. I ran over and saw rows of armed guerrilla fighters sitting and standing in a large auditorium, singing enthusiastically and joyfully. "One more, one more!" The fervent atmosphere filled the air under the kerosene lamps. I felt extremely moved and delighted.

It turned out that they were holding a night party to welcome our comfort delegation. In addition, new comrades from the Huiqing Working Group also participated, making it even more lively.

Continuous singing and an atmosphere full of excitement and solemnity shone on everyone's face. One team sang after another, fully expressing that their life was both tense and vibrant.

First, General Captain Zeng reported on the formation and current situation of their team. Then, Team Leader Huang of the Datong Comfort Delegation delivered a speech, and there was a flag presentation and financial aid. Afterwards, many speeches ended in a burst of applause, followed by enthusiastic singing and theatrical performances. Their Chief of Staff also performed magic tricks, which won a lot of cheers.

Everyone jumped and laughed heartily. This kind of meaningful party is often held here, increasing political education through proper entertainment.

Scoundrels Who Cannot Escape the National Net

It was a bit chilly in the morning. An armed team member took me to a stream beside their house to wash my face. Beside a pool of cold, clear water, sparse trees grew. Everyone squatted beside the roots of the trees and bowed their heads to wash. The water was so cold it stung, but I was still very happy.

There was a small house beside the stream, imprisoning a man and a woman. Every time I passed by its door, I stopped and stared for a long time. The man was newly captured and had committed robbery. The woman, however, was a rather formidable traitor. Today, I braved entering the house to take a peek at her face. It was as yellow as dry sand, and her face was covered in dirt.

Afterwards, I took a walk with an armed team member under the sparse trees behind the house. We talked about the female traitor. She was captured by the people in Danshui a month ago and sent here. Chief of Staff Zheng interrogated her many times, but she was extremely cunning and could speak four different dialects. Therefore, she is still imprisoned here. Later, she will be sent to the brigade headquarters. Judging from her age and appearance, it is really not easy for us to recognize that she is a veteran and capable female traitor.

She then told me that their troops often discover traitors or Trotskyites engaging in sabotage. Not long ago, during a discussion, they discovered that three people were Trotskyite elements and immediately arrested them. Everyone openly judged them. They pay the closest attention to this kind of thing.

In addition to paying attention to their own team, they also regularly guide the public to pay close attention and capture traitors. Therefore, they often receive great help from the people's ability. Traitors and Trotskyite bandits cannot escape the national resistance network.

### Why Aren't Some Big Stars Happy?

— Yi

As we imagine it, the big stars of Hollywood, with their huge salaries and extravagant lives, with both fame and beauty, should be extremely happy. But in reality, that is not always the case. Many big stars are not happy at all. They have one biggest wish, but under the control of others, this wish is very difficult to achieve. This wish is to "play roles that they are confident they can do well." Their so-called confidence is not simply baseless self-confidence. Everyone has put in a lot of self-exploration and truly knows that they have the ability to do it.

For example, take Robert Montgomery. You may have had the following question: Why do they always ask him to play that kind of role? Why do they always make him into such a frivolous young man with an arrogant smile on his face? Why can't we see this excellent actor in a different posture?

That's right, this is also what Robert himself wants to know. "Why?" He also doesn't like these kinds of roles and is simply tired of playing them. But what if he's tired of it?

It's best if we ask him and listen to his own words.

"Look," he said, "I have already repaid the company for all the benefits they have given me. Now can't they let me choose a role to play myself? But every time I express dissatisfaction with the same role they assign me, they always say that I don't know how to be grateful."

"That's not right. I always keep in mind the benefits they have given me. But if I must be as grateful as they want me to be, then it's like you gave me a small gift twenty years ago on Christmas, and I write to you twice a week, 'Thank you for the gift, which I found very useful,' and soon you will get tired of it, won't you? And how can I have such good patience?"

"I will always be grateful for the opportunities they have given me, but at the same time, I also think that I should have the freedom to play the roles I like. The kind of cunning and ruthless roles like before, I can act with my eyes closed. This is not boasting. These kinds of roles are too uninspiring. In Hollywood, there are almost thousands of people who can act as well as I do. The roles I hope for should be like 'The Night Must Fall,' with a little more comedic elements. I have hundreds of plans for these kinds of plays and believe I can act them well, and I dare to say it will be a successful work."

These are the words of Robert Montgomery. He is an intelligent, thoughtful man who can analyze himself very clearly.

Second, let's listen to Frederic March. Like the previous one, he is also tired of the roles he has always played.

"I am not a romantic type of person," he said. "I simply dare not watch my own performance in those love-talking films. It's a pity that there are many people in Hollywood who are younger, more beautiful, and more suitable for playing these kinds of plays than I am, but they just pick me. I am a Teutonic, lacking that exaggerated temperament. But I am definitely not unable to act, otherwise I would not have dedicated myself to this profession long ago. But as it is now, I am working hard to push myself to play these romantic roles. This effort is really going in the wrong direction."

It's our turn to ask questions. It seems that he has more complaints to vent and will not stop.

"Then, what kind of role do you want to play?"

"Of course, it's a light comedy," he replied without hesitation. "Not long ago, a friend discovered an old French script, full of humor, so good that I don't even want to say the name of the play, otherwise the company will buy it and send someone else to play it. If I can't get rid of this romantic role on the screen in the future, I will lose my original interest and stimulation in my work."

How eager he is to play comedy! In Nothing Sacred, he has already shown some of his comedic talent. Can Hollywood allow him to continue to move in this direction?

Here's another one, James Cagney. He also complains:

"I always play almost the same kind of plays. The audience is probably tired of watching me play the same kind of character over and over again. The company has made a lot of money on me, but after finishing the play, I feel that I am really worthless."

### Silver Notes

— Fang

Everyone knows that Myrna Loy is a gentle and graceful red-haired star, but she recently admitted that she had used nakedness to try to win the heart of a man. She said without shyness, "I once used my naked body to attract his attention. I used a kind of acting method to perform 'Sleeping Beauty' in the basement. I only wore a pair of briefs made of my mother's stockings. But the ending of the play became a tragedy. When the curtain opened, my lover did look at me, and then he burst out laughing. The play was over, and my romance ended like this." She was eleven years old at the time, and the boy's name was John Brown.

George Brent is recently busy juggling between Merle Oberon, Loretta Young, and Olivia de Havilland. People envy his good fortune, but his friends are worried about his future.

Bette Davis denied divorcing her husband. She said that those rumors are nonsense. She is now spending a vacation with her sister at Lake Tahoe. Her husband only went to the east for something and is expected to return to Hollywood soon to meet her.

Friends of aristocratic star Kay Francis say that after Kay and Baron Barker's wedding, they will go to London and South America for their honeymoon. She herself insists that she will continue her screen life. What will happen, let's wait for the next episode.

One day, the great director Van Dyke stared at the golden-voiced Jeanette MacDonald until she couldn't stand it anymore. When she asked him, he said, "Miss Jeanette: You sing like a little bird, you eat like a little bird, and if you could fly and jump like a bird, we could really put you in a cage and charge admission." What does this mean?

The most fashionable accessories for Hollywood actresses now are novel and precious brooches pinned on their collars. Claudette Colbert's is a pomegranate ruby starfish, Carole Lombard's is a colorful gemstone crown, and Barbara Stanwyck.

Tandy wears a cat's eye green-encrusted riding boot, and Irene Dunne is unique, she inlays pearls into a white lily and uses emeralds to match the green flower stem.

Dorothy Lamour's three-foot long hair, according to the eyes of Hollywood beauty experts, is considered a symbol of sexiness and an indispensable condition for playing the queen of the beast kingdom. Recently, Lamour suddenly declared that she would curl her vertical hair into a loose hairstyle, which shocked the company authorities. After some argument, the matter was settled with a raise in salary.

### Governor's Cup Football Match: Heroic Figures from Both Chinese and Western Teams, Both Sides Are Strong, Uncertain Who Will Win This Time

[Our Newspaper Exclusive] The six championship titles of Hong Kong football are divided into two types: collective competition and unit competition. The former includes the international matches, the Governor's Cup, the Laihua Cup, and the Xuzhao Cup. The latter includes the league and the special silver medal match.

The meaning of collective competition undoubtedly refers to gathering a crowd and joining forces to fight against each other. As for its schedule, it is not arranged together. They must wait for a long time before they can meet. It is not like the league, which is held every week, nor is it like the silver medal match, which is uninteresting because the strength of the opponents is too disparate. Therefore, whenever a good show of collective competition is staged, fans from all over the world want to see it as soon as possible.

What we are talking about now is one of the collective competitions, the Governor's Cup. The core of the question is the selection of players for both the Association Chinese United Team and the General Association Western United Team. This is also what fans in general are paying attention to. Let me report the news I got yesterday about the selection of players from both sides.

At 1 p.m. yesterday, many members of the Association Football Department held a player selection meeting at the Xiyuan Hall of the Zhonghua Restaurant. Chairman Zhang Minquan, Secretary Lu Xiafu, members Mo Qing, Lin Zhonghao, Chen Ziqing, Lu Lihua, and Lin Shaohua, etc., first opened a "dim sum" feast before discussing the selection of players.

For the starting eleven, except for the goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai, who was discussed for more than ten minutes before finally being approved, everyone unanimously agreed once the others were proposed. Therefore, it only took a quarter of an hour for this player selection meeting to end successfully.

At 7 p.m. on the same afternoon, members of the General Association's competition management team also held a meeting to discuss the selection of players in order to discuss a line of defense against the Chinese United Team. In advance, they had originally drafted an ideal line of defense and sought opinions from relevant associations. Those people were also seen in yesterday's newspaper. However, yesterday they suddenly received news that many warships had set sail, and only Dickson could be selected among the naval players. Therefore, the entire ideal line of defense ultimately remained ideal.

I will list the two lines of defense and then evaluate the strength of both sides, because armchair strategizing is my original responsibility. The line of defense is as follows:

Association Chinese United Team

Zhang Rongcai (South China South)

Li Tiansheng (South China South) Mai Shaohan (South China South)

Xu Jingcheng (Oriental Club) Liang Rongzhao (South China South Captain) Song Lingsheng (Oriental Club)

Hou Chengtuo (Oriental Club) Li Zhaorong (South China South) Chen Dehui (South China China) Feng Jingxiang (South China South) Deng Guangsen (South China South)

Reserves: Hui Zhongyun, Li Deqi (Oriental Club) Liu Qingcai (South China South) Yang Shuiyi (South China China)

General Association Western United Team

Harry (Kowloon Club)

Xuan Han (Middlesex) Bi Liban (Police Club)

Parker (Police Club) Dickson (Navy Team) Fei Wota (Middlesex)

Liao Yachen (Kowloon Club) Gao Shannu (St. Joseph) He Xi (Knight Team) Ge Ni (Middlesex) Yan Bachen (Military Supplies Team)

Reserves: Wu Lie, Zhi (Lili Long Club) Shi (Middlesex) Bi Ludu (St. Joseph) Yi Shitulange (Hong Kong Club)

### Armchair Strategizing

The selection of players for the Chinese United Team is roughly the same as the proposal made by my friend Dun Duanfu the other day, and it is a satisfactory line of defense.

Strengthening the forward line is an important issue for a team. This time, the three good men on the Chinese United Team's forward line are excellent talents. Liang Rongzhao in the middle is experienced and sophisticated, and his heading skills are even better. Xu Jingcheng on the left is brave and agile, with a way to intercept and repel, causing those who see him to be afraid. Song Lingsheng on the right is improving his skills day by day, providing appropriately and impeccably. In addition, they are all full of energy and run lively, which is an essential condition for being a defender. They are also accustomed to cooperating, so they will definitely respond well.

The foremost responsibility of any forward is to break through the enemy's gate with their strength. Now, the five tigers on the front line of the Chinese United Team, Chen Dehui, Li Zhaorong, and Hou Chengtuo, are all skilled. Feng Jingxiang occasionally has a move to surprise people. Therefore, I expect that this front line will not easily let go of any scoring opportunities they find, and they will definitely have a fully developed performance with pure coordination.

Li Tiansheng and Mai Shaohan are the idols of Chinese inner guards in Hong Kong today, and everyone knows how their skills are.

Goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai has performed in Hong Kong not many times, but each of his performances has won praise. I believe that his selection this time will make a better contribution.

In short, all the members of the Chinese United Team are top-notch materials. Although they are collectively selected, their skills are the same family. Positional warfare is their specialty. In addition, Rongzhao is in the center back, and Dehui is on the front line. They can adopt the third inner guard defense method and the W attack method. As long as they act according to the situation and work hard, they can be sure of victory.

On the Western United Team side, because only Dickson was selected among the naval players, the line of defense cannot be said to be ideal. However, the overall strength is not weak, and the talents are also very good. However, the coordination of the entire team is definitely not as wonderful as the Chinese United Team. Although they are both collectively selected, the difference between good and bad lies in this point.

Not having Gao Shannu in the center seems to be a mistake in the formation. He was originally a center forward material. We cannot base it on the fact that he had a good performance as a left inner forward in the port competition. We must know that in the port competition, he had Li Huitang in the middle and Hou Chengtuo on the left who cooperated well. He was as lively as a dragon and a tiger because of his good cooperation. But this time, the center forward and left wing of the Western United Team are not comparable to Li and Hou. However, the General Association player selection committee did not see this, so they used Gao Shannu as the left inner forward. I believe that he will not be able to repeat his previous good performance because he cannot cooperate with the right people. To say it more definitely, the five people on the front line of the Western United Team this time will inevitably have the drawback of fighting their own battles.

With Dickson on the forward line, he is indeed an obstacle to the Chinese United Team's front line. As for the other generals, it seems that there are flaws to be found. Although Parker and Bi Liban are called veterans, their movements have slowed down. It is expected that it will be difficult for them to resist the threat of the Chinese United Team's front line and will eventually sign a treaty under the city. (The Football Field Grand Duke)

### The Origin of the Governor's Cup

(Our Newspaper Special) The Governor's Cup football match was first held in 1932 and has been held for seven sessions so far. There is a story worth recording about the origin of this cup. Many new fans who have come to this country will definitely not know. Let me take advantage of the eve of the final of this cup to write this story out and let everyone know the inside story.

Wasn't the "September 18th Incident" happening in the 20th year of the Republic of China? The × people invaded our land with violence, and the compatriots of the whole country were indignant. At that time, the compatriots in Xianggang, under the rule of foreigners, did not have any special actions, but because they were motivated by righteousness, the atmosphere of opposing aggression was quite tense.

At this time, the Malayan Chinese football team came to Hong Kong to participate in the Hehe Cup Championship. It also happened that the scheduled competition date coincided with the start of the Hong Kong League. Therefore, one person in authority in football tried to sabotage the holding of the Hehe Cup match on the grounds of the tense situation.

The Hehe Cup match was organized by the Hong Kong Chinese Sports Association. At that time, they were still able to overcome all difficulties and finally held it as scheduled. However, due to someone's sabotage, there were very few spectators, and the ticket revenue was limited, which was not enough to entertain the Malayan Chinese team, resulting in a loss-making business.

Afterwards, the Association convened a representative meeting of various affiliated associations to discuss a countermeasure. As a result, the five Chinese associations (South China, Oriental, China, Ewo, and Chongzheng) withdrew from the Football Association and did not participate in all competitions from 1931 to 1932.

That competition was deserted and very unsightly because no Chinese teams participated. The General Association suffered even greater losses. Later, Luo Wenjin came out to mediate. The parties concerned went through many joint meetings, and finally the General Association negotiated a certain condition with the Association. The five Chinese associations rejoined in 1932 to 1933 and returned to good terms.

After the Association resolved the dispute, it proposed to the General Association to jointly organize the Governor's Cup match, thereby forever maintaining the relationship between the Chinese and Western football circles. The General Association also agreed, so this competition was started that year.

This cup is worth more than six hundred yuan and is quite valuable. According to rumors, there is also a story about the origin of this cup, which must also be described.

When Yuan Shikai violated public opinion and proclaimed himself emperor, a group of Qing Dynasty relics were actively engaged. Several former Qing officials who had a close friendship with Yuan came to Hong Kong as gentlemen of leisure after the founding of the Republic of China. When they heard that Yuan had proclaimed himself emperor, they thought that the opportunity to be promoted and make a fortune had come again. They congratulated Yuan and raised funds to order a large silver cup from a jewelry store, intending to go north together to present it to Yuan as a congratulatory gift. Unexpectedly, Yuan died soon, causing these friends to lose interest. Although the cup was made, they did not dare to go to the jewelry store to pick it up. The jewelry store, having received the deposit, could not resell it and simply put it in the display cabinet as a display item. Unexpectedly, more than 20 years later, this cup became a glory object contended by football players.

But the above story is as I heard it, and I don't know if it is true. In short, the cup has an origin, and the past battles are as follows:

1932 to 1933

Western United won Chinese United 2-0

1933 to 1935

Western United won Chinese United 4-3

Chinese United won Western United 4-3

Western United won Chinese United 4-3

1934 to 1935

Western United won Chinese United 8-4

Chinese United won Western United 1-0

Western United won Chinese United 2-1

1935 to 1936

Chinese United won Western United 4-1

Chinese United drew with Western United 1-1

1936 to 1937

Chinese United won Western United 4-2

Western United won Chinese United 2-0

Western United won Chinese United 4-2

1937 to 1938

Chinese United won Western United 5-3

Chinese United drew with Western United 1-1

Chinese United won Western United 4-1

### Stock Market Prices Continue to Rise, Sellers Intentionally Holding Back

Yesterday, the Hong Kong stock market was even more active. In recent weeks, companies such as Tramway, the Great Hotel, and Kowloon Wharf have announced substantial profits in their annual reports, leading to increased buying interest and rising prices. Although there was strong buying interest in the market yesterday, sellers felt that their holdings were valuable and were unwilling to sell, making it difficult for buyers to acquire shares. Yesterday's trading included the Great Hotel at $6.75, Tramway rising from $16.90 to $17.00, Jardine Matheson at $475, and HSBC at $1410. The trading prices for the day are recorded below:

Stock Name Hong Kong Dollars

### Why Exercise Promotes Health

— Wang Xuezheng

When beginning to exercise, the skin, being an inactive part, experiences a sudden reduction in blood supply. Many people's faces turn slightly pale at this time, which is the reason for this. However, afterward, the body gradually warms up, pores open, and the body dissipates heat through the sweat glands, thus making the skin pores clear and active. The skin is an important organ; pores are not only a kind of breathing organ, but also a kind of excretory organ, and have a close relationship with health.

To improve the efficiency of major organs such as the heart and stomach, their muscles must be strengthened. These muscles are involuntary muscles (Involuntary Muscia). The method of training is to develop and stimulate the adjacent voluntary muscles (Voluntary Muscie). For example, abdominal exercises not only develop the abdominal muscles but also strengthen the involuntary muscles of the stomach. Abdominal exercises also enable the digestive organs of the stomach and intestines to receive a large amount of blood supply, promoting digestion.

Exercise can promote the agile reflex of the nervous system, making it harmonious with the movements of various parts of the body, and making the body healthy and lively.

The spine is the most important part of the body. The spine is closely related to the nerve center and the brain. At the same time, we also know the importance of the spinal nerves. Exercise can increase the flexibility of the spine and develop the muscles of the back and waist, maintaining the posture of the spine.

(2) Developing Muscles - Exercise increases the blood supply to muscles, causing muscle fibers to become larger.

During heavy exercise, most of the fibers of the muscles being exercised contract at the beginning. For example, in an exercise mainly for developing the biceps, if heavy equipment is used, most of the biceps fibers will contract at the beginning of the exercise. After most of these muscle fibers are exhausted, they will relax, and another small part of the muscle fibers will supplement them. However, this small part of the fiber is not enough to replace the large part of the fiber that has been exhausted, so the strength gradually decreases, and one can feel exhausted in a very short time. In short, the contraction of muscles and muscle fibers is directly proportional. The greater the muscle contraction, the easier it is for muscle fibers to grow.

As for light exercises, such as long-distance running, only a small part of the fibers of the muscles being exercised contract during exercise, and after all the local fibers are exhausted, there are still a large number of fibers that can be used to supplement them. When the fibers used to supplement the fibers that contract at the beginning of the exercise are relaxed or rested, they can restore their ability to work. Therefore, light exercises can often be sustained for a long time. Although this kind of exercise does not have much direct effect on developing muscles, its indirect effect is to promote metabolism and activate the circulatory and respiratory systems, which is above heavy exercise. Moreover, to have great strength, in addition to developing muscles and exercising internal organs, it is also necessary to eliminate the useless tissues in the muscles, such as the fat tissue between the muscle fibers and the viscous liquid in them, so that the muscles can have agile effects. To make muscles develop to the most perfect level, it is also necessary to increase the activity of the muscles, and light exercise has this effect.

(3) Building up Strength - Although the training of "qi" and "strength" are different, the closest relationship to both qi and strength is strengthening the internal organs, especially the heart and lungs.

As for the importance of well-developed muscles to "strength," it is above "qi."

Exercise is also an economics of strength and qi. We should save as much as possible when applying strength and qi, and the application of strength and qi is also a science. Wasting strength and qi not only affects the strength and qi itself, but also poses a danger to the body.

In short, the greatest reason why exercise can improve health is to strengthen the internal organs. Strengthening the internal organs first and then developing muscles and exercising strength and qi can not only achieve twice the result with half the effort and make rapid progress, but also achieve the greatest effect.

### A Bias That Must Be Overcome

— Wang Yang

Today, with the Second Phase of the War of Resistance underway, we must strive to improve all basic conditions to ensure that we stop the enemy from advancing and prepare to complete our counter-offensive forces. There is no doubt that the improvement of military-civilian relations, especially at this stage, is one of the main basic conditions that we need to strive for, in line with the rapidly developing situation.

No one denies the fact that the current level of military-civilian cooperation is not sufficient. In the war zones or the front lines near the war zones, the people and the army are not only not completely integrated, but unfortunately, friction still exists in some places. This is of course the most serious phenomenon, and we must make great subjective efforts to overcome it.

The people's help to the army is completely based on the people's awareness; the army's acquisition of people's cooperation is due to their good example in action, their attitude that wins the people's love, and their practical help to the people that earns the people's goodwill. At the same time, these are the two basic preconditions for improving military-civilian relations - the people must be aware and the army must properly "induce," so that the purpose of improvement can be achieved. It is undeniable that the general backwardness of the people's consciousness and the effect of feudalism make it quite difficult for them to suddenly realize the need for military-civilian cooperation. In addition to the practical lessons of the War of Resistance, correct and in-depth guidance must be given. The fact that propaganda and persuasion are not enough is a fact, so the people's awareness is naturally not widespread, and still lags considerably behind objective needs. Under these circumstances, the army's role as a model is particularly worth emphasizing.

The people should help the army, but under the above circumstances, for the army to obtain the people's help, it must first play its own exemplary role to influence others. Quite often, we only see that "help" and "cooperation" are the responsibility of the people, forgetting how to encourage them and educate them to fulfill this responsibility, and using a coercive way to demand help and complete cooperation, which will naturally get a bad response. There are many such examples, which exist in Nanlu. This not only prevents the purpose of help from being achieved, but also prevents the progress of the entire future of military-civilian cooperation.

The bias of simply demanding help from the people without actively playing the exemplary role of the troops must be thoroughly overcome.

### Me and Woodcut

— Tang Yingwei

Whenever I think of my woodcuts, my heart aches. The woodcuts that I have carved with my heart and soul for several years are all stored in Pui Ching School in Guangzhou. Now, they have fallen into the hands of the enemy along with the fate of the school.

I think back to each of my wood blocks: carved with a high degree of enthusiasm and boiling heart and soul, with my indignation and hatred of the enemy, strong pictures, and at the same time, there are the beautiful lines in each knife-cut that make my heart feel comforted. For a second, a minute, a quarter of an hour to an hour, or a day, my spirit and my heart and soul are always concentrated on the dots and lines of the knife tip.

Woodcut is my ideal, and also my consolation. But I do not regard woodcut as a leisure activity, but as a tool for the public society and the nation to appeal and roar. Since our sacred national war of resistance broke out, our woodblocks have also exploded with the sparks of hatred. The warm and tense mood is carved into each woodblock. "July 7," "August 13," commemorating "September 18" and "January 28" are all buried with a bomb. — I have presented these black bombs to the public, and have also made broadcast appeals to the world. Although the strength of this person is limited, under the principle of "those who have strength give strength," it is right for me to push the woodcut to the front line.

However, unexpectedly, Guangzhou was lost to the enemy in the blink of an eye, and my woodcuts could not be rescued. The piles of wood blocks on the bed can only be remembered now. There is not a time when I do not think of my woodcuts. One block, two blocks... one hundred... two five hundred... when was that block carved, what was carved, I can all think of it——but what is their fate now? Wouldn't they be used as firewood by the enemy? If the enemy arranges them one by one before burning them, what will they feel in their hearts?

I will not forget my woodcuts, and I will not forget our national enemy.

I will never forget my work: hold my woodcut knife tightly.

To mourn my woodcuts, I will continue to work hard to promote the spirit of resistance in woodcuts.

### Marching in the Dabie Mountains

— Li Huiying

Under a clear sky, the branches of the Dabie Mountains, those continuous peaks, unfolded one by one before our eyes. Tall forests, a sea of clouds. Low mountain streams, the water flowing down from above, clear enough to see your face; turning, twisting, climbing slopes and descending ridges, one feels like an explorer. From the forests, from the mountain recesses, wisps of smoke float lightly, swirling upwards and disappearing...

The highway weaves in and out of the valleys, crawling like an earth-colored snake, climbing mountains, crossing ridges, passing over rivers.

Comrades cheered up. Such mountains, such roads, unfamiliar, fresh, and exciting.

"With such mountains, with such ridges, let the little Japanese devils come, let them come; we'll wipe them out in pairs."

"Let's fight a guerrilla war, let's sing a guerrilla song!"

We are all sharpshooters,
Each bullet eliminates an enemy,
Comrade Sun had just started the first line when everyone joined in, raising their voices in a heroic chorus:

We are all flying troops,
Not afraid of high water or deep rivers.

In the dense forests,
Everywhere is arranged for our comrades' campsites;
On the high mountain ridges,
We have countless good brothers;
Without food, without clothing,
The "X people" will send it;
Without guns, without cannons,
The "X people" make them for us;
We live and die here,
Every inch of land is our own,
Whoever wants to seize it
We will fight them to the end!

"Yes, we will—"

Fight them to the end!

The song reverberated in the valley, echoing through the valley mouth. Reaching the sky, spreading in all directions. The sky smiled, the mountains smiled, as if a wave was rising here.

"Down with XX imperialism!"

"Long live the Republic of China!"

Shouting loudly, roaring wildly, the mountains were also roaring.

This was a day of jubilation! In all our marches, we had never found such a rare day that filled us with such extreme excitement. We forgot our fatigue, put aside our unpleasant thoughts, let ourselves go, as if we had arrived in another world, where everything was surprising and everything made us happy.

Military trucks sped by in an endless stream, the truck beds filled with artillery shells, bullets, and explosives, transporting them from Hubei to Henan, to the front lines. The drivers were covered in dust, and the brothers guarding the trucks tightly gripped their guns, watching over the loads of supplies. When the trucks stopped to rest, they patrolled beside the trucks, afraid of passersby getting too close to the truck beds, constantly warning:

"Stay back, don't get close to the trucks."

We looked at each other, smiles of understanding flashing on our faces. Then we started chatting warmly.

"Going to Shangcheng?"

"Yes, and you?"

"The same place."

"Want some steamed buns? We have some here."

"Thank you, we're not hungry yet."

"　　　"

"Thank you very much."

Having become familiar, in the shortest possible time, we asked about each other's hometowns, shared stories of battle experiences. When it was time to say goodbye, everyone gave a common greeting, raising their fists high.

"See you in Shangcheng."

"See you in Shangcheng."

The trucks drove off, kicking up clouds of blinding dust.

"What's that, an airplane?"

Yes, in the deep valley, it seemed that the sound of an airplane was floating. Comrades looked up, but in the limited sky, besides a sea of blue, there was nothing else to see.

"It must be a car... the sound of a car is similar to the sound of an airplane."

"Maybe."

No, the sound was clear, grinding... grinding... It really was the sound of an airplane. In the deep mountains, this melodious grinding sound actually enhanced the beauty of nature, like listening to a flute, like hearing a sparrow chirping, pleasant, refreshing, not monotonous at all.

High on the mountaintop, piercing through the treetops, white specks of light shone like stars, like silver-gray butterflies fluttering their wings, from there, clear sounds traveled.

It was indeed an airplane, a Japanese reconnaissance plane.

"Scatter!"

"What are you afraid of? A reconnaissance plane can't eat people!"

"If we installed two anti-aircraft guns on the mountain, we could shoot down that rabbit-made thing!"

"Dream on! Installing anti-aircraft guns on a bare mountain!"

A comrade, in a mountain god's temple, raised a worn-out writing brush and wrote four lines of slogans:

"The temple is small, but the spirit is great,
Not even afraid of airplanes."
"The people are XX,
The gods protect them!"

"Hahahaha, what a clever soldier!"

Comrade Kong sang, giggling:

"You scold me as a soldier,
You are also a soldier,
Although soldiers are not good,
They can protect the country."

The comrades were still laughing. Some were laughing so hard they were doubled over, unable to straighten up. No one noticed that the airplane had flown away unnoticed.

"A soldier poet has emerged! Come on, recite another poem!"

Comrade Sun's two lips, like a singer performing the lotus-flower ballad, without hesitation, he recited again:

"A soldier should carry a gun,
Writing poetry is inappropriate,
Writing poetry is a good pastime,
Carrying a gun to fight wolves!"

"A show-off has emerged! A real show-off!"

"Why not prepare a zither and accompany it with rhymes from the 'Past'!"

"I didn't expect that Lao Sun is a versatile soldier!"

In the valley, there were echoes everywhere, the sound flowing in the air. In such an area, hiding, preparing to fight a guerrilla war, there was not only no suffering, but on the contrary, there was endless joy.

Five years ago, people probably won't forget, this was a guerrilla area - a battleground for two forces. On the high mountain ridges, in the dense jungles, who knows how many soldiers were hidden. Even now, whenever passing through the small towns in the valley, one can still see some of the slogans left behind, faded relics weathered by wind and rain.

"Come on, let's sing again—

Not afraid of XX XX XX,
Our brothers are truly brave when they fight,
Those XX people with guns and cannons,
Can't find our traces and shadows..."

### Reaching the Distant South

— Zhuang Ruilin

Treading shy steps
Traversing the mountains and rivers of the motherland
From the heart of the Central Plains
To cities in foreign lands
Finally, reaching this border mountain city.

Now
Everyone is exhausted
Facing the southern sun
Longing for the distant homeland

But futile longing
Crying? No
We have become strong
Without tears, without sighs

Because in our souls—
A strong fortress has been built.

### Starting from Astonishing Numbers

— Ren Yong

When astonishing numbers are mentioned, most people think of astronomical numbers. Look: the diameter of the sun is 2,557,752 miles, and that's not even considered astonishing. It is said that the distance between the Earth and the sun is 2,074,290,000 miles, which seems very astonishing.

But this number is still ordinary, because at least we still have a way to read out the place values. Here is a number like this: 496,585,345,854,800,000,000 marks. Can you fluently separate and read out the place values? I am afraid it is very inconvenient, it is really the most astonishing number.

This is the total amount of paper money issued by Germany during World War I (statistics at the end of December 1923). Before the start of World War I in Germany (end of July 1914), the total amount of paper marks issued was only 3,236,600,000 marks. This phenomenon of excessive issuance is what is called "inflation" in economics, and the result is increased prices. It is recorded that if the sales price index at the end of 1913 was 1 (base year), then the price index in October 1923 had reached 18,568,500,000. From the price index, the soaring of prices might seem vague to people who do not understand statistics, so let me tell you some astonishing facts: just how high did prices go? It is said that in early October 1923, a cup of sour milk actually cost two million marks, a cup of bitter beer cost seven million marks, and a match cost two hundred thousand marks. A pen nib cost five million marks, which is not even considered strange. The most interesting thing is that a piece of toilet paper actually sold for three hundred thousand marks. At that time, the Germans really couldn't even afford to wipe their bottoms. There are two even more peculiar things. It is said that a Chinese person who had just arrived in Berlin wanted to hire a car, but because the driver's price was too expensive, he decided not to take it. However, the driver insisted, "Since you asked me to stop here, then even if the transaction fails, you must pay ten million marks." Another Chinese person went to a German doctor for medical treatment, but the doctor's price was too expensive, and they could not reach an agreement. The doctor said, "Since you talked to me, then this period of conversation should also be paid for at fifty million marks." It is truly the saying that "time is money."

Here, we can also make an analogy: if a German had one hundred thousand marks before the European War, he would have been considered a rich man. But a few years after the European War started, all of his assets could only buy one pound of potatoes or send a postcard within the local area (it is said that each pound of potatoes cost one hundred thousand and a local postcard was also one hundred thousand). If one wanted to eat chicken eggs (which cost about one million marks), then it would take ten rich people to go bankrupt together to be able to afford it. (Note: The above facts are based on a special German correspondence on November 21st of the Republic of China year, and it shows the suffering of people's lives under the "inflation" policy.

According to recent reports, as a result of our "friendly nation" continuing to build up its military by exhausting its resources, the amount of paper money issued has increased from 10 billion (yen) to 17 billion yen. Also, according to the Japan Chronicle, the Banking Act will soon be amended to issue an additional 5 billion yen. Then the total amount will be 22 billion yen (Note: This regulation refers only to the Bank of Japan. The amount of issuance for the Bank of Taiwan is 50 million yen, and for the Bank of Korea is 100 million yen, which has also exceeded the original amount by more than double). According to the report, this increase is still to avoid inflation, it is said.

In fact, such an increase in the issuance of paper money already carries a bit of "inflation," and the proportional increase in prices is an inevitable result. Moreover, given the unreasonable trend of the military, who can guarantee that there will be no further issuance? Let's just wait and see what happens!
