### Recognition of Anti-War Sentiment Among Japanese Soldiers

According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing on the 5th, over three thousand X army soldiers recently mutinied in Dagu. The reasons for this can be analyzed in two ways: first, the general Japanese soldiers have no intention of fighting and mostly hope to return to their hometowns as soon as possible; second, Japanese officers, catering to the wishes of the warmongering military, cleverly use deceptive tactics to achieve their dispatching purposes, thus arousing public anger. According to the dispatch, another noteworthy point is that the Japanese soldiers stationed in Dagu actually mistakenly believed that "the navy intended to provoke the army, opening fire and bombarding enemy ships...", which is quite interesting, revealing the internal disputes and disorder within the Japanese army. We must have a deep understanding of this major event of anti-war sentiment among Japanese soldiers, which will be of great help in determining our strategies for resistance. This is elaborated below:

(1) The anti-war sentiment among Japanese soldiers is a highly developed form of the Japanese people's anti-war movement. Since Japanese imperialism began its aggression against foreign countries, there has been anti-war sentiment among the Japanese people. The only difference lies in whether their arguments are based on moral or self-interest considerations. During the Russo-Japanese War, Kotoku Shusui and others launched an anti-war movement. Since the September 18th Incident, not only the general Japanese public has been weary of and opposed to war, but also the soldiers on expeditions have continuously staged mutinies and attempted anti-war actions. In Northeast China, a Japanese soldier secretly transported weapons, ammunition, and food to our anti-Japanese volunteer army, which was hailed as a beautiful story around the world. During the January 28th Incident, there was also an anti-war club organization among the Japanese soldiers in Shanghai. The significance of its widespread development deserves deeper attention. From a general perspective, the Japanese anti-war sentiment began with the general public. Therefore, shortly after the outbreak of this war of aggression against China, political prisons were thriving throughout Japan. In the first half-year alone, there were three or four major arrests nationwide, with a total of several thousand people arrested. The initial form was relatively open anti-war agitation, but it soon suffered the high pressure of the fascist government and became an undercurrent. Thus, it went from theory to action. However, the most powerful link in the anti-war movement is the anti-war sentiment of soldiers. The Sino-Japanese war of aggression has been prolonged and cannot be ended. Soldiers, having been away from their hometowns for a long time, become homesick, and most of the soldiers are poor workers and farmers who have no permanent property. They inevitably worry about the lives of their wives and children, causing the general Japanese soldiers to be eager to return home. In the Japanese army, there is even a ballad circulating, "If you don't die or get injured, you will never return home," the crisis of which can be imagined. When soldiers become tired of war and oppose it, and even participate in our resistance war, then the period of the Japanese X's disastrous defeat will arrive.

(2) The inevitability of the Japanese people's anti-war sentiment is something we should clearly recognize. Today, it is not all Japanese people who are invading China, but only the Japanese rulers, especially the military. What the Japanese people get is only pain, sacrifice, and increased oppression. A Japanese Esperantist openly admitted: "...In this war, the Japanese people get nothing but disasters...Therefore, most Japanese people will not support the war...I often hear that even ignorant farmers are cursing this war" (according to Ueda Shiro's "Crush the Deception of the Japanese Military!"). Most progressive and enlightened Japanese people understand that a war of aggression cannot relieve their suffering, but only increase the oppression they suffer. The Japanese rulers, especially the military, often deceive the Japanese people by saying, "If we 'conquer' China, the people's lives will be more comfortable." But the Japanese people's reply is: "During the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, wasn't the same preaching given to the people? Until now, although Japan has not fought a losing battle, after each war, they have never thought of improving the lives of the people. On the contrary, only the wealth of the capitalists has increased, and the autocracy of the military X has become stronger..." (according to "Stop the War of Aggression Against China!"). Although these are just a few words, they have fully stated the fact that the Japanese war of aggression is contrary to the interests of the people. Historical lessons are more powerful than anything else, so enlightened Japanese people almost unanimously advocate: "There is no enmity between the Chinese nation and the Japanese people, ×××××××××××××××××××". Even starting from their own interests, the Japanese people must oppose such a "groundless" and "harmful and unprofitable" war of aggression.

(3) Regarding the Japanese people's anti-war movement, although we have recognized its inevitability and seen some of its reality, we must accelerate this trend, turning inevitability into reality and making partial reality more widespread and universal. This depends on our subjective efforts. The specific methods are roughly as follows: (A) Expand propaganda to X. Let the Japanese people, who are deceived by the military X's fascist government, know the right and wrong, gains and losses of the war of aggression, and be sure to know the disastrous defeat in the war in China and the development of Japan's isolation; (B) Treat prisoners of war favorably and provide training to correct the bad influence of the militaristic education they have received for many years with facts, so that they know that the Chinese people are their good friends, and that their participation in the resistance war in China is no different from going to heaven; (C) We must also find ways to prevent the conspiracy and counter-propaganda of the × people, and break the anaesthetic theory and deception of the × people.

However, the most powerful factor in promoting the Japanese people's anti-war sentiment is a thorough resistance war, which is what the conscious Japanese people earnestly demand.

### Along the Zengbo Provincial Road

— Bai Wei

—Return to Hui Travelogue Six—

1. A Record of Commander Chen

After inspecting Boluo City, we decided to advance along the Guanghui Highway to the front line of Zengcheng. Before departing, we revisited County Magistrate Huang and happened to meet him on the way, along with Mr. Chen Jie, the deputy commander of the Boluo Guerrilla Force. Deputy Commander Chen was also scheduled to inspect Hu and Futian that day, so the reporter was fortunate to accompany him, breaking much of the loneliness during the journey.

Leaving Boluo City, the sight of the devastated countryside was striking. Places like Sibao Water, West Bianyue... those closer to the city could not escape unscathed. However, when the × people burned our villages, they also suffered great casualties from our brave farmers, paying a high price.

Commander Chen Jie, who was traveling with us, explained everything patiently without showing any signs of fatigue. Mr. Chen can be called a vigorous old national hero. He is over sixty years old, with a three- or four-inch-long snow-white soft beard fluttering in the cold wind, showing such a heroic spirit. He speaks decisively, loudly, and passionately, with no signs of old age. Since the fall of Boluo until now, he has walked four or ninety miles almost every day, traveling to various districts under Boluo, directing and organizing strike teams, not being complacent or fearful. His image always gives us young people infinite encouragement, especially what he said, "People of our age are not far from death. Is it worth being complacent with this remaining life? What's the use of not taking it to kill the enemy?" These words show extraordinary insight. Cowards and defeatists should be excited when they hear this. Therefore, when it comes to the achievements of guerrilla warfare, Boluo is more heroic than Huiyang. Mr. Chen and County Magistrate Huang humbly said it was a matter of time and preparation. However, in the reporter's opinion, the "relationship between people" occupies a large position. The development of a guerrilla area requires not only brave cadres but also a brave commander.

2. A Tragedy of Compliant People

After we walked out of Tuanluo for more than seven miles, Commander Chen pointed to a village and sadly told the reporter a tragedy of compliant people. In that village below, the entire village of men, about a hundred people, mostly hid in the deep mountains when the × people occupied Boluo, leaving only seven or eight elderly and weak people. The seven or eight elderly and weak people were not the number that the × people wanted to kill. Therefore, during the first search, not only did they not harass them, but they also gave them military rice and biscuits, deceiving them into ordering all the men in the village to return home to receive compliant people's certificates and continue farming as usual. Four or five-tenths of them returned on the first day, and seven or eight-tenths on the second day. On the third day, seeing that there was no movement, they all returned. The × army, knowing that everyone had returned, immediately issued an order to have all the men in the village line up in the open space in front of the village to issue compliant people's certificates. When they were concentrated in the open space, they set up several machine guns and fired intensively. At most seven or eight people escaped, and the countless corpses were not yet buried. We are certainly angry at the × people's ×× methods, and at the same time, we also pity these foolish compatriots. If we had taken the lives of these sixty or seventy people to fight against the × people, how much precious value would we have exchanged for it? But they could not see clearly the × people's seemingly kind but ultimately fierce and gentle policy. No wonder Commander Chen sighed. It can be seen that in this era of rescuing the nation, overemphasizing one's own life will lose life, and attaching importance to the life of one's fellow countrymen will preserve it. Therefore, the reporter once again admired Commander Chen's insight.

3. The × People's "Bandit Area"

Xinzuotang is thirty miles away from Boluo, located at the intersection of the Guanghui Highway and the Guanghe Highway. Several sparse restaurants were completely destroyed, leaving only a few fortifications built by the × people. The bases of several guerrilla teams in Huzhen, Xiangshui, and Ping'anxu are all within a twenty-mile radius of Xinzuotang. It is certainly a hub for the × army's transportation and also a target for our local strike teams. The × people feel helpless about this area, so they call it the "bandit area." This is an honorable title.

In the villages in this area, the × people burned everything. The market town of Xiangshui originally had three hundred houses and shops. After the × people burned it four times, only one complete building remains. However, the Xiangshui Guerrilla Team, led by Battalion Commander Chen Shinan, also gave the × people the most attacks among the various guerrilla groups in Huibo. According to statistics, they launched no less than thirty or forty large and small attacks, constantly shooting and killing × soldiers and destroying bridges and roads, creating a new chapter in the history of guerrilla warfare. The houses in and near Xiangshui Market were not burned in vain. Many ashes have been stained with the dirty blood of many × people. Along the highway near Xinzuotang, I discovered many remains of × people's warhorses and many cremation pits where × people burned corpses. They are about two feet wide and more than four feet long, with soil mounds about five or six inches high padded at both ends. According to local people, they are used to support the head and feet of the corpses. Liquid chemical fuel is poured on them during cremation, and then dry firewood is laid on them for burning. Now, there is a lot of charred soil in the pits, and there are still one or two pieces of unburned bones, which is enough to show the large number of casualties of the × people in this area.

In order to prevent guerrilla attacks and sabotage, the × people have dispatched at least one squad of soldiers to guard the bridges along the Boluo section of the Hui-Guang Highway. The Xiangang Bridge has the most, exceeding three hundred people. Scattered trenches and machine gun positions are dug in front of and behind the bridge, as if facing a formidable enemy. At night, they often light gasoline lamps or burn rice straw, both to be vigilant and to boost their courage. However, although the × people are so well-prepared, the Xiangang Bridge has been destroyed twice by our guerrilla team. Later, they had nowhere to vent their frustration, so they wantonly showed their × nature and launched a large-scale burning and killing of neighboring Xiangang and Baguo and other villages. But after the burning and killing, the farmers who are the basic members of the guerrilla team have a deeper understanding of the true face of the × people and have become more active. Therefore, in the eyes of the × people, the guerrilla team has become a magical and elusive monster, posing a danger of being swallowed at any time, enough to cause them constant trouble and panic. Now that the × people have withdrawn, the self-defense corps has become stronger after training, and the anti-X sentiment is exceptionally high. It is a perfect trap for hunting × people.

4. Stroking the Remains of the Crashed × Aircraft

When our army retreated along the Chongguang Highway on October 16th last year, × aircraft flew low in groups, chasing and bombing. However, the "Eagle of the Sky," which the × people boasted about, was shot down by us and crashed in the Bawai Village not far from Xinzuotang. It is said that it was shot down by our self-defense corps with a 79 rifle.

The × people mostly used the power of the air force in this attack on South China. Therefore, before and after the fall of Huizhou, the × aircraft came very densely, and the strafing and bombing were also exceptionally low, only two or three hundred feet above the ground. Within this short distance, it is very easy to hit them by focusing fire with rifles. The battlefield and the highway are the areas where × aircraft fly low, and they are also the areas where rifles can exert their air defense effectiveness. Do not let Bawai and Wucun on the Hui-Zhang Highway be the only ones to do well (during the same period, Wucun also shot down one × aircraft).

Walking seven or eight hundred steps to the left of the Xiangruo Highway, entering Bawai Village, the wreckage of the aircraft is lying in the rice fields in front of the village.

The aircraft is a seaplane bomber, but after being burned and angrily torn apart by the villagers, most of the outer skin is incomplete. Only the characters "Showa" are left on the aircraft ×, which was probably manufactured in Showa 5th or 6th year. The engine, machine gun, and other parts inside the aircraft had already been stolen by the villagers and used as their weapons to "attack the shield of the enemy with his spear." There are three seats on the aircraft. According to the villagers, the three pilots were burned to death when it crashed. Their remains were collected and buried in the fields. Guided by the villagers, we went there to pay our respects. A mound of yellow earth rose up, becoming the "resting place of the imperial army. For the sake of the military X's titles, they finally buried their bones in the wilderness of the Central Plains. If they knew in the afterlife, how much sorrow would they have? However, even the four heavenly kings of the × people's proud air force have such an end. What about their poor ××?

Before leaving, the reporter took a photo of the empty iron frame of the × people's "Eagle of the Sky" and tore off the sun emblem on the aircraft as a souvenir.

### American Friend Ray Tillega Brought Huge Sums to Relieve Our Students and Transported a Large Amount of Medicine to Sichuan

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Airmail] Mr. Ray Tillega, an American who sympathizes with and supports China's resistance war, recently came to Yunnan via Hong Kong and will go to Chongqing in the coming days to engage in relief work for our students. Because he had lived in Nanjing for a long time and witnessed the situation in Nanjing after its fall, the reporter specially went to visit him yesterday and was told the following in detail:

Ray Tillega said: The Japanese X's security in the Nanjing and Shanghai area is very strict. Any foreign national who wants to go to Nanjing is subjected to unwarranted entanglements by the Japanese X at the upper and lower military stations. The prosperous Nanjing has now become a dark hell, with murder and arson all being the masterpieces of the "Imperial Army." XX looting is especially the homework of the "Imperial Army." Outside Yuhuatai, at Yan Ruoshanjin, are the corpses of Chinese people who were brutally killed by the Japanese X. (The X people even use corpses as clothing buttons.) In front of the Confucius Temple, are the brothels and opium dens opened by the Japanese X. The income from these toxic places is the cost of the puppet government. The X soldiers in Nanjing are all like traitors and running dogs. They do not dare to walk alone. Every Chinese person's heart is always filled with memories of the Republic of China, and they secretly engage in the great work of killing X and saving the country. Even the police and gendarmerie of the pseudo-government are involved in assassinating traitors. All of this proves that the hearts of the Chinese people have not been conquered by the iron hooves of the Japanese X. He also said: The Japanese warlords now do not dare to let their ten soldiers stay in Nanjing for a long time, and they will be transferred after a few days. This is because of the increasing anti-war sentiment among Japanese soldiers. The Japanese puppets once forced Chinese and foreign teachers in Beijing to hold so-called "anti-Chiang" delusional movements, but all the teachers ignored them after repeated orders. The pseudo-government also wanted to allocate funds to jointly run refugee camps by Chinese and foreign teachers, but they were repeatedly rejected by the teachers. Mr. Qing Tillega concluded: "Because there are Chinese anti-Japanese guerrillas in the suburbs of Nanjing, and there are often assassinations of traitors in the urban area, the Japanese and X traitors are mostly panicked and cannot sleep peacefully!"

Mr. Ray Tillega is here on behalf of the American Youth Federation to engage in relief work for our students in China, carrying US$18,000 for relief purposes. The reporter immediately asked about the current situation of the American aid to China movement. He said: "American aid to China work can be said to be advancing day by day. Although I have not witnessed the situation of the US government lending to China, I predict that the aid to China movement will definitely increase further due to the government's active attitude. I am carrying this relief fund, which is purely the result of enthusiastic donations from American young students. The amount of relief funds for this year must be even greater, and what is even more exciting is that Japanese students in the United States are also actively participating in the work of opposing Japan's aggression against China. Although the Japanese consul has severely suppressed them, it is still ineffective. Regarding the movement to stop arms dealers from selling arms to Japan and boycotting Japanese goods, Americans are currently actively promoting them."

He also brought a large batch of medicines (weighing 2,000 kilograms) to Sichuan for the United Sichuan Hospital, which was purely donated by Americans. It is said that it has not yet been shipped due to customs barriers.

The reporter learned that he came to China via Japan and asked about the situation in X Country. He said: I stayed there for five days and saw that the economic strength of Japan had been exhausted. It can be asserted that its aggression against China is self-defeating and collapse is not far away. The biggest reason is nothing more than the unanimous boycott of Japanese goods by various countries, which has made its economic difficulties greater and it is no longer able to buy arms from abroad with large amounts of money as in the past. In order to restrict gasoline, each household of four is limited to sharing one car and cannot exceed the limited amount of gasoline. For all daily necessities, they try to replace them with other items. Tofu is used instead of eggs, and the lowest-quality local cloth is used to make kimonos. All commodity prices have increased by more than 30%. The people's anti-war sentiment has reached the highest level. The warlords use a policy of deceiving the people to deceive the masses. Since the war began, the number of soldiers who have died has reached more than 800,000. What they are propagating domestically is only more than 30,000. The general public hopes to end the war as soon as possible. However, the young soldiers are still tirelessly restless. Therefore, the anti-war atmosphere in the country is getting tighter day by day. Not only the people, but even the newspapers are promoting for China, arousing the people's anti-war sentiment. For example, after the fall of Yuehan in China last year, the newspaper once recorded that "Japan has conquered China." At the same time, it carried, "The Prime Minister summoned domestic arms manufacturers to rush to manufacture arms to meet this long-term resistance war." This is an example of the X people propagating for us. At this point in the conversation, it was already midnight, and the stars and moon were hazy. The reporter bid farewell to him.

### Southern China × Commander Ando Convenes Military Conference × Increases Troops Around Guangzhou × Brigade Commander Killed in Jin ×

[Guilin Special Dispatch, Our Newspaper, 7th] Ando, the × Commander of Southern China, convened a joint conference of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in Guangzhou on the 2nd, deciding to launch a major invasion southward. × Twenty-four warships have already set sail in two batches from Taiwan, with the destination being Beihai.

[Chongqing Special Dispatch, Our Newspaper, 7th] × The 8th Brigade, Okada Unit, with over 6,000 men, invaded westward from Liaoxian on the 4th, engaging in fierce fighting with our forces at Lianggu. One of our divisions has rushed to reinforce. Over 2,000 × troops from Huoxian, with ten mountain guns, invaded eastward in three routes. Our forces intercepted them at Yuantou, Yangzao, and other villages. The × troops even used poison gas, causing many of our officers and soldiers to be poisoned. However, they continued to fight bravely and did not retreat. Currently, one of our armies is moving to encircle them.

[Chongqing Special Dispatch, Our Newspaper, 7th] On the 2nd, the × troops launched a surprise attack south of Yuxiang. Our army fought desperately, and the fighting was extremely fierce. The × Brigade Commander Nonaka was killed. The morale of the army was greatly disrupted, and they fled in all directions. One of our divisions came to reinforce, taking advantage of the victory to attack Xia County, annihilating several hundred × troops. The × troops closed their doors and defended to the death, awaiting reinforcements.

[Chongqing Special Dispatch, Our Newspaper, 7th] There have been no changes on any of the battlefields. However, the fighting in Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, and Chahar is quite intense. The × troops, launching a large-scale offensive towards various parts of Shandong, have been counter-attacked separately by troops, civilians, and local defense teams under the command of Shen Honglie, resulting in a [unclear] situation. In the Northeast, we have captured Gaomi and are now [unclear] encircling and intercepting [unclear] the × troops in Laizhou, Yexian, Pingdu, Changyi, Shouguang, Guang[unclear], Boxing, Huanji, Zouping, Puji County, [unclear] Huimin, Lijin, Shuanghua, Linyi, and Zhangqiu. Many × troops [unclear]. The × troops in Feixian and Si[unclear] in southeastern Shandong are being attacked on two sides by us. The × troops in Xintai and Laiwu are attempting to invade our Yiyin and Yishui, but we have already cut them off. The × troops in Liaocheng, Qingping, and Boping in northwestern Shandong, and the × troops in Juye and Yuncheng in southwestern Shandong, are panicking due to our [unclear] attacks.

### Our Plainclothes Team Sneaks into Guangzhou × Opens Shops and Inns in the City Small Teams of × Soldiers Loot Food Everywhere

[Reuters Guangzhou, 6th] Since Guangzhou was occupied by the Japanese army, the situation there is similar to that in Nanjing and Hankou. Shops run by the Japanese have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Several Japanese inns have also begun to operate, with Japanese women providing all the hospitality. It is said that a dance hall is also being prepared and will open soon. Most of the Japanese shops sell groceries, with various cans, food, and bicycles available. Foreign goods can also be purchased. Transactions are conducted in Japanese yen, with the national currency and Hong Kong dollars converted at the exchange rate of the day. Most of the Japanese shops and inns are located on Taiping Road. The offices of the Yokohama Specie Bank and Mitsui & Co. are also located there. Several days ago, plainclothes teams were discovered in the city, having infiltrated from the suburbs. Therefore, the Japanese military garrison has become more vigilant. Last week, two Chinese were accused of being "guerrillas" by the Japanese army. One of them attempted to resist and was shot dead by the Japanese army. The other two were arrested.

[Reuters Guangzhou, 6th] Puppet police have recently appeared on the streets here for the first time since the Japanese army occupied the city last October. This police force consists of 300 men, recruited recently by the puppet "Public Security Maintenance Association." Several puppet police stations have also been established in various locations. It is said that order will now be maintained jointly by the puppet police and the Japanese army.

[Reuters Guangzhou, 6th] The "Public Security Maintenance Association," which is run by the Japanese here, is currently planning to reopen the city's slaughterhouses. Most of the meat currently sold in the market has not been inspected for hygiene.

[Reuters Guangzhou, 6th] Although the Japanese side has revoked the previous order prohibiting the sending of secret telegrams, those sending telegrams must still submit the original manuscript to the puppet "Transportation Bureau."

[Awareness Society Panyu Express News] On the 2nd of the month, the Guangzhou × army dispatched two side × warships and one transport [unclear], sailing to the Dashan River. Then, at 1:00 PM that afternoon, over twenty rubber speedboats [unclear] carrying over 400 × soldiers, under the command of Yoshida Hayashi, the × army regimental commander, landed on Dashan. In addition to dispatching × sentries to guard the streets, they also directed the × soldiers to loot food from the above-mentioned villages. In Dashi [unclear] and Mi[unclear], they seized over 500 bags of rice and looted all the chickens, ducks, and livestock from the villages. Until 5:00 PM, the × soldiers carried the looted food onto the warships and transported it to Xinzao for use by the × soldiers. It has also been found that there are still six × shallow-water warships stationed on the Dashan River, patrolling back and forth on the river from time to time.

### Another Assassination Case in Shanghai Two Traitors Killed The Murderers Were Not Captured

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 7th] Shanghai news: Two more traitors were shot and killed in the Public Concession in Shanghai on the morning of the 7th. One of them was Zhou Zhitang, an advisor to the Supervisory Administration Bureau of the Puppet Ministry of Finance and Director-General of the Jiangzhe Foil Tax Bureau, who was ambushed on Xinza Road at around 9:00 AM on the 7th. He was shot twice in the head, his brains splattering out. He was sent to Baolong Hospital, but died only minutes later. The two assassins had been lying in wait behind a utility pole there. When he passed by, they jumped out from the side of the road, followed him for several steps, and then pulled out new-style automatic pistols, aiming at the back of his head and firing two shots in a row, both hitting their mark. After achieving their goal, the two calmly escaped. Another assassination case occurred at around 11:00 AM in the tea room on the second floor of Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road. The victim was named Gu Bingzhong. At around 10:00 AM, he and five or six friends were having tea in the park and planning to have lunch. At 11:30 AM, Gu went to the escalator to make a phone call. While he was on the phone, suddenly there was a [unclear] loud noise. Gu fell to the ground [unclear], lying in a pool of blood. [unclear] For a moment, the order was in chaos, and the tea drinkers fled in panic. According to eyewitnesses, there were a total of five [unclear] shooters, all wearing Chinese clothing. When they went downstairs, [unclear] opened a check [unclear], and before leaving, they said, "We are killing traitors. You don't need to panic," and other [unclear] words. [unclear] The detectives questioned [unclear], dispatched personnel to rush over, but Gu had already died. Many passes issued by the Japanese military intelligence department and puppet organizations were found on his body. Furthermore, it was learned that Ma Yuhang, the puppet Nanjing City Government Secretary-General who was assassinated a few days ago, was from Fengxian County, Guangdong.

Concession Police Car Shot At By ×

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 7th] Shanghai news: Late last night, several people in the area between Kaixuan Road and Bailinan Road in the western district of Shanghai fired rifles and pistols at a police car passing by. All the occupants of the car were patrolmen from the Public Concession. As a result, the driver was injured. That area is connected to the Japanese-occupied area. However, the Public Concession patrolmen have no right to search or fire back in the area.

### Our Army Recaptures Weixian in Southern Hebei × Army Suffers Extremely Heavy Casualties

[Luoyang, Central News Agency, 6th] The × troops in Pingxiang invaded our Weixian on the morning of the 2nd, engaging in fierce fighting with our army all day. The × troops suffered extremely heavy casualties. Due to our insufficient forces, we were forced to withdraw on the 10th, and Weicheng fell. Until our main force arrived, we immediately launched a counterattack against the × troops. The fierce fighting was intense, and even more × troops were killed. The × troops collapsed and fled westward. We sent teams to pursue and attack, while also recovering Weixian. The [unclear] gains are being cleared. Furthermore, the × troops who fought in Pingxiang and Changhe [unclear] this time, [unclear] our army [unclear] uniforms, and held our national flag, attempting to confuse our ears and eyes. The despicable behavior of the × troops is such.

### Kunming Cultural Dynamics (3)

—Dream

Tongji University: During the "August 13 Incident" in Shanghai, this school struggled for a long time in the midst of artillery fire. It moved from Shanghai to Jinhua, then to Ganzhou, then to Babu. Now it has moved from Babu to Kunming. Their new campus has been found near Kunming.

Some of the students who came to Kunming from Babu traveled by sea, while others traveled on foot. These students who came to Kunming on foot did not do so entirely because of financial difficulties. The main reason was that they were unwilling to detour to the foreign territory of Hanoi and were willing to endure the hardship of walking. This is the "practical and realistic" school spirit of Tongji University.

Zhongzheng Medical College: Originally located in the suburbs of Nanchang, Jiangxi. Part of the new campus had been built when the war of resistance began. Nanchang became the target of × aircraft bombing. For safety reasons, it moved remotely to Liuzhou for classes. Recently, it moved from Liuzhou to Kunming and is currently building a campus near Bailongtan in Kunming. After a month, it can move to the [unclear] campus to study.

More than 100 students have arrived in Kunming. They temporarily borrowed the YMCA for classes on the 20th and 23rd of this month. This is a public medical college. The students are willing to endure hardship, and there is a spirit of mutual assistance and love among the students.

Sun Yat-sen University: Fled from the artillery fire in Guangzhou. Guangzhou fell on December 28. A part of the administrators and a part of the instruments and books of Sun Yat-sen University left Guangzhou on the 27th. Their losses were only a part of the instruments and books of the Medical College and the Engineering College. The others had already been moved out of Guangzhou. Most of the students are in Hong Kong, and they have been coming to Kunming one after another recently. Their campus has been found in Zhengjiang, 100 kilometers away from Kunming.

What Sun Yat-sen University regretted when it moved out of Guangzhou was that the newly built campus, worth more than 10 million yuan, fell into the hands of the × troops relatively intact. Speaking of this, we cannot help but feel particularly heartbroken.

Before the five major [colleges] mentioned above, Kunming's highest institution of learning was Yunnan University. It is located in the culturally backward southwest, and everything is of course unable to develop. Therefore, the students at Yunnan University in the past were of a relatively low level. In the Chinese interior, where transportation is inconvenient, education is indeed greatly affected.

Last summer vacation, Yunnan University was changed to a national university. The Ministry of Education appointed Xiong Yan to preside over the school affairs. Mr. Xiong has been in the education field for many years. This time, he returned to his hometown to serve and did his best to reorganize and revitalize the university. In a very short period of time, the situation of the school was not as it was before. Famous professors were hired, and the level of the students was raised. Under Mr. Xiong's strict [unclear], the students gradually developed a style of studying. This is one of the points worthy of attention in the progress of Southwest culture.

(3) Cultural Figures

The cultural figures in Kunming now include Shen Congwen, Zhu Ziqing, Gu Jiegang, Mu Mutian, and Xie Bingxin. Not long ago, Shen Congwen wrote several articles for the New Trends Bi-Monthly, including an article entitled "To Young Friends," which was written out of dissatisfaction with the student summer training. He spoke very sadly, but his articles have rarely been seen recently. Zhu Ziqing and Mu Mutian are the directors of the Yunnan Branch of the Chinese Literary and Art Circles Anti-× Association. Mu Mutian often writes articles for Yunnan's [unclear] products and is greatly respected by many young people. Gu Jiegang teaches at Yunnan University. He is the chief editor of the "Frontier" of the Yishi Daily. Xie Bingxin has arrived in Kunming, but I have not seen her articles. She does not often attend literary and art groups. She is probably writing a new work [unclear].

Not long ago, Mao Dun and Wang Lisxi arrived in Kunming. The Cultural Association specially invited them to a tea party at the People's Education Hall. Zhu Ziqing was also present. The place was packed, a grand occasion in Kunming's cultural circles. Wang Lisxi spoke about the current situation of international aid to China. Recently, the Yunnan Branch of the International Anti-Aggression League was established. The cultural circles of Yunnan have received much encouragement from them.

### Bai Chongxi Speaks in Yunnan Our Country Will Win More Than 10,000 Audience Members Applaud and Cheer Bai Leaves Yunnan and Flies to Guilin Immediately After Speaking

[Kunming Special Dispatch, Our Newspaper, 6th] (Late Arrival) Director Bai Chongxi spoke to all sectors of Yunnan on the morning of the 6th at the expanded memorial week. Using the experience of the past nineteen months of the War of Resistance as proof of our favorable situation in military, political, economic, and international aspects, he said that the victory of the War of Resistance will surely belong to us. The entire audience of more than 10,000 people responded with enthusiastic applause and cheers. After Bai finished speaking, he immediately left Yunnan by plane and returned to Guilin.

### Our Army in the East Theater Will Immediately Begin the General Offensive The Main Force Is Gathering at Designated Locations × 50,000 Soldiers Reinforce the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway

[Chongqing Special Dispatch, Our Newspaper, 7th] Because our guerrillas are active in the eastern theater, the × troops have now transferred 50,000 soldiers from various battlefields to encircle and attack along the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway and the southern shore of Taihu Lake.

[Jinhua, Central News Agency, 7th] Since our crossing-the-river troops launched a general offensive along the Shanghai-Hangzhou line in the eastern theater, they have made rapid progress. Currently, the northern bank of the Qiantang River and all the major cities in Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou are under our electrical control. The vanguard army has advanced to the vicinity of ×××××. While reorganizing the guerrillas, it is also organizing the masses to strengthen the local self-defense forces and jointly recover the lost territory. It is heard that large units are continuously being ordered to go to designated locations to concentrate. Once the deployment is complete, the general offensive will begin.

### Developing the Western Resources It Is Said That National Reconstruction Bonds Will Be Issued Monthly Sales of Debt in Hong Kong Reach 100,000 Yuan

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, our country's authorities have issued various public bonds to cope with all wartime expenditures. The bonds issued since the War of Resistance include National Salvation Bonds worth 500 million yuan, National Defense Bonds worth 500 million yuan, and three types of Gold Bonds, totaling approximately 550 million yuan in national currency. Relief Bonds worth 100 million yuan, totaling 1.65 billion yuan. On the other hand, Japan has issued public bonds worth more than 6.88 billion yuan since the outbreak of the war. Comparing the two, we are only one-fifth of Japan. The disparity in the burden per capita is even greater. Judging from the financial resources, it is even clearer which of our × countries can support the long-term War of Resistance. Recently, according to banking circles, our country's War of Resistance has entered a new stage. In addition to coping with the war, we are also working hard on the construction of the west as a basis for supporting the long-term War of Resistance. Our government is actively promoting this, and overseas Chinese investors are particularly enthusiastic. Therefore, the current promotion has achieved considerable results. However, this kind of work is complicated and requires a lot of money. The Central Ministry of Economic Affairs is planning to issue National Reconstruction Bonds worth 500 million yuan for this purpose. This debt is specifically used to develop the rich resources of the southwest, northwest, and border areas. It is heard that the issuance regulations have been drafted, and they can be officially announced and implemented after they are approved. The reporter believes that this news is of great concern to Hong Kong overseas Chinese. If it is true, it will not only absorb social idle funds and give the people an opportunity to save the country, but also the plan to develop the rich resources of the west will be promoted more smoothly. Therefore, he specially visited various parties to inquire about everything. Relevant parties have also heard about this matter, but have not been able to verify it. According to Sir Zhou Shuchen, a gentleman of the Hong Kong National Salvation Bond Promotion Committee, the Hong Kong has not yet received a formal notice regarding the Ministry of Economic Affairs' issuance of National Reconstruction Bonds. It is also expected that our country's government has such a plan. Therefore, this debt is entirely used for national construction, and its importance is not less than that of war expenses. As for the promotion of National Salvation Bonds in Hong Kong, the situation is also very optimistic. At the beginning of the Guangdong War, although the war affected people's hearts and was slightly hit, the war is now gradually stabilizing, and we have grasped a favorable position, so the debt sales have also returned to their old appearance. Currently, monthly sales are about 100,000 yuan. Although the number is not large, it can be said that it has achieved considerable results. (Jun Ren)

### Southwest Economic Investigation Cooperation Association

Chongqing Branch Established

[Kunming Special Dispatch, Our Newspaper, 7th] The Kunming Branch of the Southwest Economic Investigation Cooperation Committee was established yesterday.

### Wanxian Tragedy Commercial Area Completely Destroyed by Bombing Fire Spreads for a Day and Night

[Associated Press Chongqing, 6th] Foreign church authorities in Guiyang telegraphed Chongqing, reporting on the bombing of Guiyang last Saturday. All foreigners are safe, [but] the commercial area was completely destroyed. Regarding the bombing of Wanxian by aircraft on Saturday and Sunday, official reports confirmed that the French Catholic Church there had been destroyed. It is believed that all foreigners are safe and sound. Japanese aircraft also destroyed the Islamic Mosque, as well as two newspapers and two banks. A fire broke out, burning fiercely, and was extinguished only yesterday afternoon. It is estimated that more than 1,000 people were killed or injured in the bombing of Wanxian.

[Associated Press Chongqing, 7th] Official observers here believe that the Japanese side may apply the same [unclear] behavior of indiscriminate bombing of Guiyang and Wanxian to Chongqing. Therefore, they ordered residents to evacuate. The police are assisting residents and shops in storing large quantities of sandbags in preparation for extinguishing fires. Shelters have been built in open spaces and private gardens. The population of Chongqing has decreased from 600,000 to 300,000. In addition, many people hide in the mountains every morning and return to the city at night. However, officials and military personnel take it lightly, because they have long been accustomed to it on the front lines of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Wuhan.

### The "Living Buddha of Ten Thousand Families" of Xiangtan

— Special Correspondent Geng Ya

If inspecting the front lines requires long-distance travel by car, I'm not afraid of aircraft "visits", but I am afraid of the car breaking down midway—the car I took this time to go north was "a thing of old age serving the public." Upon seeing it, I was a little uneasy. Unexpectedly, just near the Xiangtan Station of the Xiang-Qian Railway, it suddenly let out a sigh, followed by a few shudders, and stopped, declaring: "Exhausted and retiring!" Its attendant official—the mechanic—tried all kinds of remedies without success and asked me to appeal to the Hengyang Power Plant for help. As a result, on the third day, an "ambulance" came from Hengyang to tow it back for repair. Therefore, I had to plan to start acting alone, using guerrilla tactics, first crossing the river to Xiangtan, then taking the Xiang-Qian train to Zhuzhou, then transferring to the Yue-Han Railway to go north, to Changsha, to Miluo, to... Matters concerning "guerrilla secrets," please forgive me for not pre-issuing the check.

Almost destroyed by fire and becoming "Changsha's Scorched Earth Second," Xiangtan, viewed from the highway across the Xiang River, looks like a tall, slender lover of the Xiang River, lying close to the left side of the Xiang River. It is so slender that you can't see the feet when you see the head. Therefore, Changsha people like to use her long shape to compare with the neighboring Changsha's blocky city scene, calling it "Changsha is a piece, Xiangtan is a line."

The ferry is downstream of the newly built bridge piers of the Xiang-Qian Railway, but when rowing the ferry, it is still necessary to cross diagonally against the current under the bridge. The bridge piers are about seventy to eighty feet high, half submerged in the water and half exposed above the surface, standing majestically on the river, like a row of tall and brand-new pagodas, very spectacular whether viewed from afar or near. Unfortunately, due to the impact of the enemy's invasion, construction has to be temporarily suspended.

After landing and entering the city, it took a very, very long walk to reach the main street of the bustling area. The city's main streets consist of only three, all running parallel to the Xiang River, forming the shape of the Chinese character "川" (river): the one closest to the riverbank is called "River Street," the middle one is called "Main Street," and the remaining one is called "Back Street." Business is relatively quiet on Back Street and River Street, while Main Street is very lively. Businesses such as silk and satin, cloth, department stores, and hotels and restaurants are mostly located on Main Street, lined up for business. At that time, it was already late, the electric lights had just come on, and the pedestrians were still very crowded. The business at the stores was also extremely lively. Originally, Xiangtan was a wharf on the Xiang River, and recently it has become a disguised loading and unloading station at the eastern end of the Xiang-Qian Railway (the railway was originally open to traffic to Zhuzhou, connecting with the Yue-Han and Zhe-Gan Railways, but because the "Xiang River Railway Bridge" was suspended, Xiangtan became a loading and unloading station). It is known that "the spirit of the place" will surely help it gradually move towards prosperity. However, the reason why it has suddenly gained a distorted prosperity, such as the sharp increase in store business revenue, the full occupancy of hotels and restaurants, and the ability of porters and coolies to earn more money, are all phenomena that suddenly occurred after the Changsha fire. In other words: Xiangtan's current distorted prosperity is indeed due to the Changsha fire, with "people" and "wealth" scattered everywhere, and Xiangtan, being close to the water, absorbed a large amount, thus making a windfall.

However, although Xiangtan was lucky enough to make a windfall from the Changsha fire, it was almost caught in the "fishpond disaster" of the Changsha fire, turning into nothing in a burst of fierce fire and thick smoke!

During the Changsha fire, Xiangtan, being close to the area, was flooded with wounded soldiers and refugees. Among them, some so-called "arson squads" also arrived one after another. Upon meeting with the county government, they immediately dispersed to the houses on each side street, setting up ladders and fire-starting tools, preparing to carry out a bamboo-like arson on the three "川"-shaped bustling streets!

They—the arson squad—moved skillfully and spoke passionately. The citizens who had not been evacuated or escaped did not dare to interfere with them. That kind of crisis, sharp to the extreme, was very much like the Three Kingdoms era when Wu general Zhou Yu was preparing to burn Cao's troops at the Battle of Red Cliffs. The reason for the moment before the fire was set was simply: "Everything is ready, only the east wind is lacking!"

This time, the east wind that Xiangtan was blowing when the fire was about to be set was also controlled by one person, like Kong Ming. So, the difference is that Kong Ming's east wind had to be borrowed through magic, but this person's east wind was genuine and contained in his mouth. As long as he was willing to spit it out, he would surely send Xiangtan into a sea of ​​fire, burning it to "Changsha's Scorched Earth Second" in a burst of crackling and peeling! However, he had unique insights and believed that there was no need to spit it out. Thus, Xiangtan, sitting on the crater, was finally rescued by him.

"Changsha's Scorched Earth Second!" This was originally a somewhat煽惑性glorious term. When the Changsha fire itself was still under debate. It is said that the former county magistrate, Mr. ×, seeing that the situation at the front was unclear, also asked that person to agree to Xiangtan emulating Changsha and quickly implementing scorched earth, with the reason of "heroic sacrifice." Otherwise, it would be too late. That person replied, "I have a duty to defend this land here. I have not been ordered to retreat, nor have I seen the × being defeated. Even a blade of grass must be protected with all my strength. How can I not ascertain the truth and set fire to a city where the lives and property of hundreds of thousands of people are entrusted? However, if you really want to make a heroic sacrifice, it is advisable to postpone it for three days before making a decision." However, in fact, by the next day, the mistake of the Changsha fire was revealed to the world. The arson squad waiting for the "east wind" in Xiangtan was disarmed and sent away with foreign money. The citizens of Xiangtan all returned home, seeing their houses intact, and their chickens and dogs unharmed. Later, after learning the truth, they were deeply grateful in their hearts and offered 20,000 yuan in gold and a specially made brocade banner with the words "Living Buddha of Ten Thousand Families!" to respectfully thank that person. That person declined the money but accepted the banner. He was then ordered to lead his troops to other places. Upon arriving at the destination, he remitted the money back in full.

Who is that person? Even I have never met him, because he had left more than a month before I arrived here. However, from the tone of the person who told me this story, I heard that he was a division commander named Du. There is also a highway from the city to the bus station, which he also advocated and built with military labor. The citizens carved a stone to name it "Yugong Road" to show their gratitude. The words "Du Yugong" are not his name, but surely his alias.

Although this touching story happened two months ago, at that time, everyone's attention was focused on the unprecedented Changsha fire. At the same time, Xiangtan was located in the rear, and this crisis of almost becoming "Changsha Second" was subtly resolved invisibly—so the great process of this story is still little known to the outside world. However, I am happy to record it, and the significance is not simply to value the news value of the story itself, nor is it to promote the hidden virtues of the people in the story, but to use this to arouse everyone's research and understanding of other important issues related to this story.

First, in the second phase of the War of Resistance, our highest leader revealed the main points, saying: "The foundation of victory in the War of Resistance in the future lies entirely in our ability to fight independently... independently and autonomously." From the story of Xiangtan's "turning danger into safety," it proves that among our general defending the land, there is no lack of people who can have the spirit of "independent autonomy" with initiative, awareness, and responsibility. This is one of the conditions for laying the foundation for victory.

Second, our highest leader also said: "We must not make unnecessary sacrifices in order to accomplish tasks." This of course includes manpower and materials. Xiangtan's not hastily implementing scorched earth in the name of sacrifice, and finally completing the task of defending the land, is one of the expressions of the progress of the main spirit of the Second War of Resistance. It is also the second condition for laying the foundation for victory.

Third, the troops stationed in Xiangtan can do their best to protect the property of the local people, and the people can also sincerely express their respect and love to the army. This is the ironclad proof that the army and the people are truly united and resisting the war with one heart, and it is also the third condition for laying the foundation for victory.

Fourth, the ongoing work of resistance is a great opportunity for the sons and daughters of China to be born in an era where "times create heroes" and "heroes create situations." It is easy to establish extraordinary achievements by bravely killing the enemy at the front lines, and it is also possible to establish great merits by relying on one's conscience and using all one's intelligence in the rear, like General Du's effort to avert the disaster in Lake Xiangtan. A good opportunity for the ages is hard to come by again, compatriots, encourage each other!

Fifth, the all-out war of resistance covers more than ten provinces, and the front lines extend for thousands of miles. Among the tens of millions of soldiers and civilians active in the front and rear, there must be many who have the outstanding deliberation and determination of General Du. There must also be many who unintentionally create achievements like the "Living Buddha of Ten Thousand Families" in Xiangtan. This is a great manifestation of the spirit of our nation's resistance to the war, and it is also a valuable page in the history of our nation's success in the war of resistance. We should not let it be self-generated and self-destructed, and we should collect and preserve it.

### British Undersecretary Answers Member Questions: Considering Economic Aid to China, Demanding Japanese Compensation for British Losses, Silence on Closing the Yangtze Cannot Be Tolerated

[Reuters, London, 7th] British Undersecretary Butler, in the House of Commons yesterday answering questions from Sir Gasa, stated that the government has received 300 claims for compensation from British merchants in China, totaling £230,000, all caused by direct destruction, confiscation, looting, or damage by the Japanese army in China. The government has forwarded these claims to the Japanese side. Such claims for compensation are usually cleared and settled after the end of the war. A member asked whether it was true that Japan had announced that it would not compensate for the loss of foreign property. The Undersecretary replied, "I cannot accept such a broad statement." Mr. Marston then asked under what international law Japan was prohibiting British ships from sailing on the Pearl River. The Undersecretary replied that Japan claimed that the movement of third-country ships would hinder the Japanese military operations currently underway on the Pearl River. Mr. Henderson asked if the Chinese government had requested assistance and what the government's response was. The Undersecretary replied that some suggestions from China for economic assistance were being considered, but it was not convenient to provide any detailed reports at this time. Mr. Marston then asked whether he had received a statement from the Japanese government regarding the opening of the Yangtze River. The Undersecretary replied that he had not received any further statements from the Japanese side since November 14 last year, and that further evidence regarding Japanese trade on the Yangtze had been submitted to the Japanese Foreign Ministry by the British Ambassador to Japan on the 13th of this month. Labour MP Alexander then asked, "Is the government willing to remain silent on the Japanese government's policy of stopping British ships from sailing in China?" The Undersecretary replied "No." Peter MacDonald asked whether the government of Burma had supported the improvement of the Burma Road to Yunnan and whether the government would thoroughly improve the road to modern standards in order to develop this trade route to the Far East. Mr. Moorehead replied on behalf of the government that the government of Burma had made the 120-mile road from Lashio to the Chinese border passable in all seasons and would continue to improve other sections of the road. Mr. Morgan then asked what steps the Prime Minister would take regarding the fact that the Japanese authorities in Qingdao were preventing foreign improvements and the export of goods financed by the Bank of China in Chinese currency, and whether this "prohibition" had been extended to other ports. The Undersecretary replied that in recent months, the Japanese authorities in Qingdao had often refused to issue export permits, sometimes citing the reasons given by Mr. Morton, and sometimes failing to explain the reasons. The British Consul in Qingdao has repeatedly protested to the Japanese Consul there, but the Japanese Consul has argued that "necessity requires the issuance of export permits." The Undersecretary also said that the Japanese authorities have recently extended the system of "military necessity requiring the issuance of export permits" to Weihaiwei and Yantai, and the government is paying close attention to this.

### Chamberlain's Speech: Close Ties Between Britain and France; France Attaches Great Importance to German Silence; Italian Political Circles Feel Uneasy

[Haitong News Agency, London, 7th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain, in the House of Commons tomorrow, will answer questions from members regarding French Foreign Minister Bonnet's recent statement in Congress that when Britain and France are drawn into war, the troops of the two countries will be dispatched by one country, saying that this statement is fully in line with the agreements made by the British government.

[Reuters, London, 6th] Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons regarding Anglo-French relations is considered extremely important by French political circles, as the speech clearly shows the inseparable and close ties between the two democratic countries of Britain and France. Chamberlain's guarantee implies that Britain and France are not very concerned about Franco-Italian relations, but only indicate that if Germany attacks France, Britain will definitely help France. This point is considered to be of particular significance.

[Reuters, Berlin, 6th] The discussion here on Chamberlain's remarks remains silent. A spokesman told our reporter that Prime Minister Chamberlain's guarantee to France is not a new fact, and that a similar guarantee was made during the previous Czech crisis. The future development of the situation depends on whether Chamberlain's remarks will strengthen France's attitude. If France's attitude is strengthened as a result, it will make the current situation even more tense, and the consequences will be dire. One commentator said that Chamberlain's guarantee is not much different from Germany's guarantee to Italy.

[Reuters, Rome, 6th] Prime Minister Chamberlain's guarantee to France has made Italian political figures greatly nervous. They believe that this shows that Britain and France have the same interests, and that it is more frank and accurate than Chamberlain's previous statements. One side said that Chamberlain's guarantee is equivalent to a military alliance, and its binding effect is no less than the German-Italian relationship declared by Hitler. Some political observers believe that this statement has shattered Italy's belief that Britain has not provided France with military assistance. Italy has always believed that French Prime Minister Daladier has been seeking this guarantee since the Munich Agreement, but has been rejected by Chamberlain. Now it shows that Daladier has had his wish fulfilled. Officials do not comment on this, but say that Italy's natural aspirations will not endanger the important interests of any country.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 6th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the country's House of Commons today, making a statement on the ties between Britain and France. Afterwards, Fascist Party members here all expressed disappointment, saying that this speech almost declared that Britain and France had concluded a treaty of alliance to deal with the totalitarian countries.

### Palestine Conference Opens in London Yesterday; British Prime Minister Addresses Arab and Jewish Representatives Separately; Resolving to Mediate Disputes with Peaceful Policies

[Reuters, London, 7th] Today's opening ceremony of the Palestine Conference at St. James's Palace here was held in two ceremonies. The Prime Minister first addressed the Palestinian Arabs and representatives of their countries, and then addressed the Jewish representatives. This is because the Arabs do not recognize the Jewish delegation. The Prime Minister addressed the Arabs, saying, "My policy is peace. You should know that my method of seeking peace is mediation, and the first step in mediation is contact. When disputes arise between the peoples of two countries, only the strength of politicians can complete a compromise based on justice. Before us now, there is a task that needs to be worked on. The matter is undoubtedly difficult, but it is by no means beyond our reach." The Arab delegation, including representatives from the Mufti Party and countries near Palestine, was welcomed by the Prime Minister into the famous Queen Anne Painting Room and began talks in front of the Carra painting. This is truly an unprecedented meeting. Officials made every effort to isolate the two sides, and the Jewish delegation was welcomed later into the banquet hall on the other side of the Carra statue, because the Arabs refused to sit in the same place as the Jews.

Four Opinions of the Arab Delegation

[Reuters, London, 6th] The High Committee of the Arab delegation is currently busy preparing a report to submit the Arab side's views to the Palestine Conference. The opinions include: (1) Recognition of the complete independence of Palestine; (2) Concluding a treaty to replace the mandate; (3) Abolishing the Balfour Declaration; (4) Immediately stopping Jewish immigration and land sales. The Committee has received many telegrams from groups in Egypt and Palestine, two of which specifically point out that the representatives of the National Defense Party can only represent the party, and the High Committee should represent Palestine. These telegrams have tended to strengthen the attitude of the Islamic leaders' faction towards the National Defense Party's faction. The reconciliation of these two Arab delegations may not be achieved in the short term. Today, the Indian Muslim League issued a declaration of sympathy for the Arab demand for independence through its London representative. British Minister for Indian Affairs, the Marquess of Zetland, received a copy of the declaration and promised to forward it to the British government. Nashashibi, the leader of the Arab National Defence Party delegation, told a Reuters reporter: "I feel deeply that the British government truly desires to reach a solution to establish peace in Palestine. The National Defence Party will accept any proposal that will enable Palestine to become independent. Our delegation is determined to work for the justice of the country. No personal ambition, regardless of the outcome. The National Defence Party is willing to cooperate fully with the Mandate government to solve this problem."

[Reuters, London, 7th] The Arab National Defense Party delegation arrived at Waterloo Station here yesterday, and Colonial Secretary MacDonald welcomed them.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 6th] The local police discovered several rioters hiding in the village of Seouri last night. A struggle ensued, killing two armed Arabs and arresting seven, and seizing a large number of arms and weapons.

### After the Soviet-Hungarian Breakup, Hungarian Interests Entrusted to Japanese Embassy

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 6th] After the Soviet-Hungarian breakup, the Hungarian embassy staff have been ordered to return home, and the interests of the country's overseas Chinese have been entrusted to the Japanese embassy for care. Hungarian Minister Dr. Jungert also asked the Japanese embassy to handle the closing affairs of the Hungarian embassy before leaving. The Japanese embassy recently announced that it will temporarily take care of the interests of Hungarian expatriates until the diplomatic representative of a third country officially accepts the Hungarian entrustment. Most foreign diplomatic representatives regard this matter as difficult. Since Poland and Hungary maintain friendly relations, they could originally accept the Hungarian entrustment, but relations between Poland and the Soviet Union have recently improved greatly, and the two sides are in negotiations to plan to sign a commercial agreement. Under these circumstances, Poland is naturally unwilling to offend the Soviet Union by taking care of the interests of Hungarian expats.

### Britain and France are Cooperating Closely, Will Try to Mediate the Spanish War; Spanish Government Troops Continue to Enter French Territory; Temporary Meeting Decides to Retreat with All Troops

[Associated Press, London, 7th] The previous Anglo-French plan to mediate a ceasefire in Spain, having been rejected by both sides, has been declared a failure. Now that Franco has demanded the unconditional surrender of the Spanish government, government officials have different opinions. The Spanish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister plan to send three conditions to Franco: (1) Withdraw foreign volunteers; (2) Hold a referendum to listen to public opinion and decide what kind of government Spain should establish in the future; (3) The two sides will not take retaliatory actions in the future. The Spanish President, however, advocates unconditional surrender to avoid war.

[Central News Agency, London, 7th] It is reported that the Spanish government has asked the British government to mediate the Spanish civil war. The British side has not yet raised the matter with Franco, the leader of the Spanish National Army. The National Army has expressed its rejection of mediation. The British government is now cooperating closely with France to find ways to end unnecessary bloodshed in Spain, but it is not known what steps the two countries will take.

[Central News Agency, London, 6th] Regarding whether the Spanish civil war can be ended, the British government authorities probed the opinion of the Duke of Alba, the informal representative of the National Army government in London, this morning. National Army figures here commented that General Franco will definitely demand the unconditional surrender of the government troops, and that those who have never committed crimes after the end of the war may be granted a death.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 7th] The French Foreign Ministry announced that if Spanish Government Prime Minister Negrín does not immediately go to Valencia to preside over everything, the French government will consider the Spanish Republican government "to have temporarily ceased to exist."

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 6th] According to news received here, Spanish Republican President Azaña arrived at Sarges, 20 kilometers south of Geneva, at 6 p.m. today.

[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] The local press tried all day to find out the whereabouts of the Spanish government officials. By nightfall, they had mostly been confirmed. President Azaña is in the Alpine resort of Aelper, and Prime Minister Negrín is in a temporary frontline in Tairee. Other cabinet members are scattered in Paris and Panbyinan. Negrín and some cabinet members are determined to continue their resistance and have decided to go to Figueras to attend a parliamentary meeting.

[Central News Agency, Aquilana, Northern Spain, 6th] After the President of the Republic went to France, Prime Minister Negrín, with most of the cabinet members, withdrew from the city of Figueras on the evening of the 4th. The next day, they held a meeting a few kilometers from this town (that is, 15 kilometers from the French border) and decided to take all necessary measures to order the government troops to retreat completely, and designated several teams to go to the central region. In the future, the Republican government will choose one of Valencia, Murcia, and Cartagena as the temporary capital.

[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] Thousands of French troops have arrived at the border to strengthen defenses, preparing to deal with and dispose of Spanish government troops retreating into French territory. The French government said that key Spanish government officials cannot engage in any activities after retreating into French territory, so as not to affect France's neutral status. France's accommodation of refugees and retreating troops is purely on humanitarian grounds. According to the situation in all directions, the government troops are willing to make peace, only awaiting appropriate conditions.

[Associated Press, Pau-Guten, 7th] The Spanish government troops and baggage in Prugsada began to retreat at 11:30 last night. Dozens of heavy artillery were first transported by trucks across the border highway into French territory, non-stop throughout the night. All were disarmed after entering the country. It is not yet known whether the infantry will continue to retreat to France.

[Associated Press, Perpignan, 6th] After the defeat of the Spanish government troops in Catalonia, a large number of troops retreated to the French border, and key government officials also fled to France. Government aircraft also landed at French airfields. According to reports, the government troops are now seeking peace to end the war, but the rebels can only accept the unconditional surrender of the government troops. Thousands of French troops are now concentrated on the border, preparing to drive out any intrusions by the Spanish rebels. Spanish Foreign Minister Tarvaillo is consulting with foreign ambassadors, and it is said that he has asked French Ambassador Henri to mediate the war, but Henri denied this. It is also said that Spanish President Azaña intends to hold peace talks in Paris.

[Associated Press, London, 7th] The "Daily Mail" commented on the Spanish war today, saying, "The Spanish war has reached its final stage. If peace cannot be negotiated at this time, it will cause an even more cruel tragedy." Spanish President Azaña and Prime Minister Negrín are aware that the government troops can no longer continue "the war, and future wars will have cruel consequences."

### China Is Growing Stronger: Soviet Pravda Discusses Our Situation, Preparing for a Counteroffensive Decisive Battle

[TASS Moscow, 7th] Pravda recently published an article titled "The New China Is Growing Stronger": The article states that Japan's last attempt to defeat the main force of the Chinese army on the Wuhan line has completely failed. China's resistance against foreign bandits and its fight for freedom has entered its second stage. During this time, China's military strength has greatly increased, and the combat capability of Chinese soldiers has increased many times over. The battle line has been extended by more than four thousand miles, making any offensive by the Japanese extremely difficult. The Japanese soldiers have reached mountainous areas, and the possibility of joint operations has been completely lost. The Chinese army is preparing for a decisive counteroffensive, backed by the rapidly developing economic foundations of the western and southwestern provinces. The unity of the Chinese army and the people is also becoming increasingly consolidated, and the long-term cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is extremely firm. The expulsion of Wang Jingwei from the Kuomintang has been approved by all the Chinese people, which demonstrates the determination of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party to eliminate internal reactionaries.

### Support for Democratic Countries: Policy Should Be Public, Sales of Aircraft to Japan Should Be Banned, U.S. Senator Pittman Says

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] Senator Pittman stated that the President's policy of aiding democratic countries and selling aircraft to France should be made public immediately. However, he supported the U.S. government's ban on selling aircraft to Japan, saying that Japan had violated the Nine-Power Treaty and the United States should not aid violators of treaties.

### German Government Considers Issuing New Public Bonds: Military and Public Works Expenditures, Merchants and People Cannot Support It

[Reuters, Berlin, 6th] It is learned that when Dr. Funk, the Minister of Economic Affairs, took office as the head of the German National Bank, he was advised to maintain the stability of wages, prices, and currency, and to avoid the tax increases advocated by Dr. Schacht. The economic theory of the National Socialist Party also does not allow currency inflation but believes that the increase in the amount of paper money in circulation, along with the increase in goods production, is not inflation. Dr. Funk believes that the National Socialist Party's financial management is not a one-generation task, and debts must be distributed over a longer period, which is contrary to Dr. Schacht's policy. Industrial companies and the public are now unable to help the government pay for the large expenses of military preparations and public works, so the government is currently considering two possible solutions: (1) expanding the existing short-term or medium-term debt that has matured; (2) issuing new public bonds. It is reported that Dr. Funk hopes to increase production after implementing the Four-Year Plan and rationalizing industry to prevent price increases. He also hopes to resolve Germany's international debt problem, believing that when the Jewish emigration problem is resolved, there will be no danger of capital flight, and the relaxation of foreign currency restrictions and consideration of Germany's new loans will be possible.

### Five Years of Soviet-American Relations

— Translated by Wang Jianming

The United States was the last major capitalist country to establish formal relations with the Soviet Union. Despite repeated requests from American public groups to establish normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, the reactionary Hoover government never accepted the demands of the American people. Only after the Republican Party failed in the 1932 election and the Democratic Party led by Roosevelt came to power were formal relations between the two governments established in 1933.

In May of that year, President Roosevelt gave a note to Chairman Kalinin of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, in which he pointed out that the absence of formal relations was an abnormal situation and proposed that the Soviet Union send representatives to consult on establishing normal diplomatic relations and exchanging envoys. The Soviet Union then sent People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov as its representative.

For the Common Effort of Peace

On November 7, 1933, Litvinov, in a speech to American journalists, called attention to the fact that human separation had still existed between the two countries until that time, "In fact, the people of our democratic countries have never stopped working for mutual progress with the greatest sympathy and sincere goodwill." He pointed out that "in the interests of the two countries there is a solid foundation for scientific, cultural and economic cooperation," and therefore the two are "united by a common effort for peace."

On November 16, 1933, Roosevelt exchanged documents with Litvinov regarding the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries.

The past five years have confirmed the fact that the absence of formal relations between the Soviet and American governments was due to obstruction by reactionary forces in the United States, especially Hearst's yellow newspapers, which continue to slander the Soviet Union and spread various false news about it even today. Reactionary forces in the United States are not interested in the two countries cooperating internationally to stop aggression and strive for peace.

The Friendship of the American People

However, the American public knows very well about the Soviet Union's great success in all aspects of the economy and in cultural life, and about its powerful and peaceful policies. The consistent peace policy and anti-aggression policy followed by the Soviet Union has received a heartfelt response in various circles of the United States with extremely different natures. The cooperation between the two governments in seeking peace around the world has been praised by the broadest strata of the American people, who are interested in maintaining peace.

It should be noted that the lack of persistence in the United States in the anti-aggression struggle is due to the oppression of reactionary forces supported by isolationist sentiments, which are still prevalent among the petty bourgeoisie. Monopoly capital is not only uninterested in the struggle against fascist aggression but also helps fascist countries in every possible way.

The relationship between the American and Soviet people is shown by an unchanging spirit of friendship and sympathy. When aerial heroes flew non-stop from Moscow to the United States via the North Pole and stayed there, the American people expressed their special sympathy for the Soviet Union. As soon as they saw the heroic Soviet aviators, the American people cheered for the great socialist country.

In recent years, economic aspects have shown constant expansion and development of trade. In 1933, the total trade volume between the United States and the Soviet Union reached 22.78 million gold yuan, while last year it reached 73.6 million gold yuan. Trade has been expanding year by year, and the original materials show a further consolidation of economic ties between the two countries. The conclusion of the commercial agreement facilitated its growth, and in May the agreement was extended for another twelve months.

Development of Cultural Relations

Cultural relations between the American and Soviet people have also developed with great success. Children's art exhibitions, Stalin Constitution exhibitions, and Soviet architecture exhibitions, with the participation of thousands of Americans, have achieved great success. Soviet films shown on American screens almost always win popular praise and acclaim. Even reactionary newspapers have to admit their success.

In addition to the existing American-Soviet Cultural Association and the Society of Friends of the Soviet Union, there is also the recently established American-Soviet Association for the Promotion of Diplomatic Relations. The purpose of the association is to make the Soviet Union's peace policy and achievements in socialist construction known to every family.

Next year (referring to this year - translator), the Soviet Union's participation in the New York International Exhibition will play an important role in making Americans aware of the Soviet Union's achievements in politics, economy, and culture.

There is no doubt that the relations between the two countries will continue to develop in the spirit of friendship and mutual sympathy between the American and Soviet people, because both great nations are interested in maintaining world peace.

### British Government Reforms Cotton Industry: Government Plan Has Been Released, Cotton Textile Industry Bureau Established to Promote It

[Reuters, London, 6th] The British government released its plan to reform the British cotton textile industry tonight, advocating the establishment of a Cotton Textile Industry Bureau, composed of fifteen members, and financially assisted by the Ministry of Commerce. The bureau's powers are as follows: (1) managing the registration and taxation of factories; (2) assisting in improving the production and sales of the cotton textile industry through technical, economic, and publicity methods; (3) reviewing cotton textile industry plans by region or department. Special steps under consideration include the establishment of an export promotion committee and an advisory committee, and efforts to protect the interests of the rayon, wool, and textile industries. The most important aspect of this cotton textile industry reform plan is the mandatory registration of factories by the Cotton Textile Industry Bureau. The registration of merchants is to be decided by the merchants themselves. Government assistance is calculated in pounds, with a maximum of £40,000 per year for the first five years. The bureau's branches can also borrow money to handle various matters, but this debt is limited to £3 million.

### British Pilot Sets New British-Philippines Record

[Haitong News Agency, London, 7th] British pilot Ken Shah, 24, flew from London to Cape Town yesterday in just 39 hours and 24 minutes, setting a new flight record between the two places. It is reported that Ken Shah was flying a Percival Gull aircraft, which won the championship in last year's King's Cup air race. This time, Ken Shah attempted to return from Cape Town to London within four days.

Short Commentary

### Congratulations, Chamberlain!

The result of Chamberlain's cabinet's policy of appeasement over the past year has been, on the one hand, to strengthen the arrogance of the fascist aggressors, and on the other hand, to cause the fall and near fall of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and even Spain. At the same time, the position of Britain and France in Europe and even in the world has been greatly and negatively affected. Therefore, people with righteousness and vision within Britain have launched opposition movements, which have become increasingly fierce recently. This is undeniable. This situation is not only not a blessing for the Chamberlain cabinet but also not a blessing for the entire world.

To break this dangerous status quo, apart from the victory of the Anglo-French People's Front under the active policy of the Soviet Union and the United States, the only other option is for the Chamberlain cabinet to abandon its appeasement policy under internal and external pressure, starting with strengthening Anglo-French cooperation, strengthening the peace and democracy front, and jointly attacking the fascist aggressors.

A London dispatch on the 7th stated: Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons on the afternoon of the 6th: "Britain and France have an inseparable relationship, and if the vital interests of France are threatened, no matter where this threat comes from, Britain must immediately cooperate with France." Chamberlain's speech is naturally a reflection of the recent expression of support for democratic countries by the Soviet Union and the United States and the anti-appeasement movement in Britain. Chamberlain's declaration will naturally have a consolidating effect on the peace and democracy front and can also serve as a major force of resistance against fascist aggressors, but first and foremost, Chamberlain's regime can thereby obtain temporary stability. Therefore, we must say, "Congratulations, Mr. Chamberlain!"

However, Hitler and Mussolini, who "get rich" by intimidation, at most express shock and protest in the newspapers at this kind of declaration. Mussolini's followers even said sarcastically: "If you step on a lion's tail, it will definitely bare its teeth to scare people, but it's just a 'row of false teeth' — Therefore, we must intensify the efforts of the people of Britain and France to urge their governments to implement this 'joint resistance to aggression' declaration immediately after it is made, and to use strength to sanction the aggressors — what we want to congratulate is not the Chamberlain regime's transformation from danger to safety, but the strengthening of the democratic peace front, creating an invincible lineup to encircle and suppress fascist aggressors.

### Dutch East Indies Air Route Will Extend to Hong Kong: Hong Kong Will Become a Major Hub for Far East Air Routes, Dutch East Indies Company Will Set Up Hong Kong Station and Contact Pan American, Planned to Be Realized Next Year, Hong Kong to London Only Takes Four Days

Hong Kong's civil aviation industry is developed. Three of the four major Far East air routes (Pan American, Imperial Airways, Air France, Dutch East Indies) have established stations in Hong Kong. The only one remaining is the Dutch East Indies Company (full name Royal Dutch East Indies Airline). According to Mr. Horton, representative of the company's Philippine office, the Dutch East Indies line will also extend from Batavia to Saigon to Hong Kong in order to connect with the Pan American line. If this statement is realized, Hong Kong will become a hub for air routes between the United States, the Netherlands, Britain, France, and various parts of the Far East. Regarding the above news, although all aviation authorities in Hong Kong said that they have not received confirmation, they also said that this move is a natural development. It is also very possible that the British and Dutch authorities have discussed this issue in London. It is reported that the Dutch East Indies Company had sought the consent of the United States to add a line from Java to Manila. However, since Washington did not reply for a long time, it changed its target to Hong Kong. If the U.S. had agreed to the establishment of the route earlier, there would be no need to set up a station in Hong Kong, as its purpose was to connect with the Pan American line. It is also reported that the Dutch East Indies line and the Dutch Airline (full name Royal Dutch Airline) have always been in contact. The Dutch Airline is the parent company, with Amsterdam as its headquarters. Its routes cover the European continent and have regular routes between Amsterdam and Java, with Batavia as its headquarters. The Dutch East Indies line is limited to the Dutch East Indies archipelago and has flights to Australia, Saigon, Darica, and northern Borneo. The Dutch Airline authorities will specially manufacture DC-4 express planes to participate in the Batavia-Amsterdam line next year and will add night flights. In the future, this section of the journey can be reduced from five and a half days to two and a half days. If so, if the line establishes a station in Hong Kong, the journey from London to Hong Kong can be reduced to four days. It is reported that the DC-4 plane can carry 40 passengers during the day and only 16 passengers at night.

### After Fujian Tea Is Transported to Hong Kong for Centralized Export, Sales Break Forty-Year Record: A Total of 90,000 Boxes Were Sold Last Year, With a Profit of More Than Two Million Yuan

This newspaper's special dispatch: Tea is not only Fujian Province's largest specialty product but also its most important export. Annual production is over 10 million yuan, and it has had a considerable position internationally in the past. However, in recent years, because tea-making methods have not been improved, the quality has also declined. Other factors, such as transportation congestion and lack of capital, are also fatal to Fujian tea. Business has therefore greatly decreased, and the biggest blow has been the large-scale dumping of tea products from Taiwan and Ceylon to various parts of Southeast Asia, Europe, and America. Fujian tea's position has almost been completely encroached upon. Later, the crisis deepened, and the Fujian Provincial Government could not sit idly by. Therefore, it used the power of the government to resolve to reorganize it. First, it sent personnel to various places in Southeast Asia and Ceylon to investigate in order to improve the quality. Then, it established a black tea chain store to control the tea leaves transported overseas and set up a tea warehouse management office to store the tea leaves transported to Fuzhou and insure them. From April of last year, it merged the original tea improvement agencies to establish a tea management office.

Last year, when normal tea leaves began to be produced, X people invaded Minyou, and Xiamen unfortunately fell. The defense of Fuzhou was also suddenly tight. Tea is the lifeline of Fujian, and foreign trade cannot be interrupted once. Therefore, the tea management office transported all the tea leaves for foreign sales to Hong Kong. One reason was for safety, and the other was for convenience of foreign sales. At that time, except for the first spring and white hair tea leaves, which were sold in Fuzhou in advance at the request of merchants and foreign firms, all other tea leaves for foreign trade were transported to Hong Kong. Therefore, after the "May Tenth" war, Fujian tea exports can be said to have been completely concentrated in Hong Kong.

Last year, the tea leaves transported to Hong Kong from Fujian totaled approximately 120,000 boxes by the end of the year. Approximately 90,000 boxes were sold. Of the 30,000 boxes in storage, most are by-products of flakes and powder, with very little refined tea. Of the remaining refined tea, 70-80% are Minbei Xiaozhong, and only 20-30% are Kung Fu tea. As far as the sales of Fujian tea are concerned, the Soviet Union accounted for the majority last year, and Europe and America were slightly inferior. In terms of price, it was approximately 50-60% or 20-30% higher than in previous years. This number can be said to have broken the record of Fujian tea for the past forty years. The reason for this is not the result of the accidental increase in the quality of tea but rather because, at this time, the tea products of Henan Province, Anhui Province, Jiangxi Province and Hubei Province were also concentrated in Hong Kong, openly displaying samples, evaluating quality and price in the same market. Fujian Province tea leaves are indeed superior to those of other provinces. The true advantages can be distinguished, which is why Fujian tea exports have made such long strides in the last few months of last year. According to statistics, the profit from the export of Fujian tea transported to Hong Kong last year totaled more than 2 million yuan. This is entirely due to the Fujian Provincial Government's sharp reforms to tea. (Jun)

### Tram Company: A Cashier Died Tragically on Lockhart Road, Beaten to Death Late Last Night

At around 7:00 a.m. yesterday morning, a teenager was found dead in a pool of blood on Lockhart Road near Jianshan Road in Wan Chai. Passersby reported it to the police, who reported it back to the police station. The officer on duty immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. When the detectives arrived, they saw that the teenager had suffered serious head injuries, his feet and mouth were also broken, and his internal organs were also injured. They inquired with nearby residents and shopkeepers, but no one knew the real cause. The police found this matter extremely strange and suspected that the teenager was murdered, and also suspected that he fell to his death. They immediately telegraphed the government photographer to take photos of the scene and the deceased's body. Then, they called a hearse to transport the body to the mortuary. Afterwards, the police found that the teenager was a cashier at the tram company, named Ye Fu, who lived at a certain number on East Street. It was also heard that the teenager had an argument with someone near there late last night, which resulted in him being beaten by several people with iron bars and sharp weapons. Because it was late at night, there were few pedestrians, and only a few cries for help were heard. After that, nothing was heard.

### Relief Federation Held a General Meeting Yesterday: The Problem of the Vocational Training Institute Aroused Another Fierce Debate: The Comfort Group Proposed Merging the Vocational Training Institute Into the Industrial Cooperative Society: Representatives Debated, and the Result Was Postponed for the Next Discussion: It Was Decided to Hold an Expanded Memorial Service for the Death of the Premier

The Hong Kong Relief Federation held its 3-5th joint meeting at the Tung Wah Hospital conference room at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. More than 20 group representatives attended. Chairman Ye Lanquan of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association and Secretary Shi Bohan, after each group reported on a week's work, began to discuss the proposal. The most important one was the proposal from the Women's Comfort Group to merge the Relief Federation's refugee vocational training institute into the China Industrial Cooperative Society. Li Jianfeng first refuted it, followed by representatives who successively expressed their opinions. After more than an hour of debate, there was still no result. The chairman, considering the importance of the case, asked the representatives to study it in detail and discuss it again at the next meeting. The next most important matter was the proposal by He Xiangning to have the Relief Federation launch an expanded commemoration of the "March 11" anniversary of the death of the Premier, which was approved by the entire body.

Our Special Feature

### National Association of Young Women's Christian Association: Activities During the War of Resistance

— Qi Zhuo

An Interview with Ms. Cai Kuishi, General Secretary of the Association

As the motherland is reborn, alert women are also striding forward towards the rising sun of the times. — Ms. Cai Kuishi, General Secretary of the National Association of Young Women's Christian Association, and Ms. Gui Bao, Vice President of the World YWCA, hosted a grand gathering for women in the Yanjing Hotel the night before last, and our sincere expectations were noted in yesterday's newspaper, so I will not elaborate further here. To understand the activities of the National Association of Young Women's Christian Association during the War of Resistance, our reporter visited Ms. Cai Kuishi again yesterday and obtained many moving materials.

The night before last, the reporter had to leave midway due to an engagement. When the reporter saw Ms. Cai again, she said excitedly:

"This is truly a rare opportunity. Not only did the representatives and leaders of the women's community in Hong Kong attend enthusiastically, but also representatives from the YWCA branches in Guangzhou, Hankou, Beiping, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Kunming participated. Therefore, I was very happy to report the recent work of the National Association of Young Women's Christian Association to everyone, and I hope that the branches in various regions will coordinate and develop their work. Mr. He Xiangning was delighted that this was a rare gathering of women representatives from all over the country and gave enthusiastic encouragement. The gist of her speech was: 'The freedom, equality, and fraternity advocated by the YWCA are in line with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's principles of people's livelihood, people's rights, and democracy. This is the most urgent need for China today. I hope everyone will seize this excellent environment and work towards this goal...' I don't understand Cantonese, but I only know that this was roughly the gist."

Ms. Cai is originally from Jinhua, Zhejiang, and has been working at the YWCA for over ten years. She speaks Mandarin very fluently.

Getting to the main topic, Ms. Cai answered the reporter's questions very kindly:

"The National Association of Young Women's Christian Association has more than 10,000 members, including people from all walks of life. There are 19 branches in cities across the country. Three or four have been suspended due to the war. The headquarters has sufficient funds. In addition to donations from countries around the world, the branches in various regions must also pay membership fees to the headquarters every year. For example, Hong Kong and Tianjin have to pay 1,000 yuan in national currency every year. However, for branches that are unable to be independent, the headquarters provides assistance until they grow, and then they are released. For example, most of the expenses of the Kunming branch are subsidized by the headquarters."

——The reporter believes that this fully demonstrates the spirit of motherhood in nurturing children!

Ms. Cai continued:

"This time, we came to Hong Kong and launched a fundraising campaign with the Hong Kong branch, raising more than 16,000 yuan. Two-thirds will go to the Hong Kong branch, and one-third will go to the headquarters. This is a rough outline of the financial situation.

What international publicity has the National Association of Young Women's Christian Association done during the War of Resistance? Ms. Cai said:

"There are YWCA organizations in 58 countries around the world. We reported the atrocities of the Japanese to the YWCAs of various countries as if we were reporting to our own families. The telegrams expressing sympathy and assistance flew in like snowflakes. Religious groups also prayed for us and sent donations of over 100,000 to help us in the War of Resistance. China also has representatives attending the General Assembly of the World YWCA, and Ms. Huang Gui Bao is the Vice President of the Association."

What specific work have the branches of the National Association of Young Women's Christian Association done in the War of Resistance?

Ms. Cai explained the four work guidelines to the reporter in detail: 1. Rescue and relief; 2. Propaganda and organization; 3. Popularization of wartime education and technical education; 4. Advocacy of industrial production. What impressed the reporter more was that before the War of Resistance, the headquarters had already run six terms of first aid classes, and after the outbreak of the war, they were assigned to serve in various military hospitals. In order to reduce the worries of the soldiers at the front, they also launched a service campaign for the families of soldiers on expeditions. They used various methods, both spiritual and material, to comfort the families of soldiers. For example, telling them stories of the War of Resistance has been very effective.

Elementary school students donated their money to buy clothing materials for the YWCA to make clothes, and then returned them to the children to personally carry piles of cotton clothes to comfort the troops. The children and female comrades felt infinite joy, and the soldiers were deeply moved.

Students who are in financial difficulty are given relief. There are also many unemployed women who are living in hardship, so they are guided to engage in various industries to enrich production. Although each region has its own situation, they are all working hard under the general goal of "Resistance to Japan First." —— This is an outline of their work.

Ms. Cai will leave Hong Kong during the day to go to Kunming, Guiyang, and Chongqing to inspect the wartime work of the YWCA in various regions. It is expected that she will be able to return to the headquarters by the end of April.

### Three More Brave Men Leave Camp in Ma Tau Chung, British Police Open Fire and Wound a Young Girl, Two of the Three Brave Men Escape, One is Detained and Returned

Three of our brave men who had been accommodated in the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp in Kowloon City secretly left the camp. Unfortunately, they were discovered by the guards and injured by gunfire. Just as the authorities were planning to improve the situation, three more brave men secretly left the camp yesterday. They were discovered by British police, who opened fire to stop them, resulting in a bloody incident in which a passerby was injured. Our reporter went to investigate the incident afterwards. It is reported that at 11:25 yesterday morning, one brave man carrying an axe, hoe, and hammer secretly left the camp. Unexpectedly, he was spotted by a British policeman numbered 35 just a few feet away from the camp. The British policeman shouted at them to stop, but the three ignored him. The British policeman then sounded a loud whistle, intending to intercept them. They turned a deaf ear. The British policeman then fired three shots, intending to warn them. At that time, a young girl was passing by. After the shots rang out, she was hit in the buttocks. The young girl fainted on the spot. When the British policeman saw that he had injured someone, he immediately notified the Kowloon Hospital to send a car to the scene to take the injured person to the Kowloon Hospital for treatment. The injured person was named Lu Ru, 22 years old, and lived on the second floor of 159 Tam Kung Road. Fortunately, she was injured in the buttocks, which is not a vital area, and there is no danger to her life. As for the three brave men, two escaped, and one was detained and returned to the camp for detention.

### Under Air, Land, and Sea Invasion by the Japanese, the Battle in Bao'an is Tense Again. Japanese Shelling on Dachanshan, Four Roads of Japanese Troops Repelled, Number of Japanese Warships Increases Sharply off Dapeng, Women and Children Evacuated from Various Areas

Since Bao'an County was ravaged by the Japanese army last year, there has been no clean land left. Ruined walls and broken houses are everywhere. As it stands now, business is far worse than before. Unexpectedly, before the vitality has recovered, the Japanese are attempting a second invasion. Yesterday, the 6th, they sent out a large number of remnant Japanese troops and a fleet to invade Huangsonggang in the second district of Bao'an County. As a result, the battle situation has become particularly urgent again. According to talks with passengers who came to Hong Kong from Bao'an yesterday morning, the Japanese army has been sending out large numbers of bombers to bomb various areas of Bao'an since the 3rd of this month, attempting to invade. Later, they were tightly repelled by our defending troops. Unexpectedly, on the 6th, the Japanese army launched a large-scale invasion with naval, land, and air forces, and sent three Japanese warships to harass the waters off Dachanshan. Our defending troops stationed there fought fiercely with the Japanese all day long. The sound of artillery and guns could be heard throughout Bao'an. Now, women and children in Bao'an have automatically evacuated, and the market situation is becoming increasingly desolate. A desolate atmosphere has reappeared. Yesterday, a Mr. So-and-so who returned to Hong Kong from Bao'an on a small ferry said that the Japanese invaded my Western Route. The defending troops of the Western Route fought bravely to defend their homeland, so the Japanese were unsuccessful and retreated hesitatingly. Although the situation is deteriorating, the ferry continues to operate. If the war breaks out again, we will discuss it again at that time. In addition, Liang Chuangzhong, the head of the Dapeng police station, came to Hong Kong yesterday on official business. According to him, after Dapeng was ravaged by the Japanese army a month ago, the people fled in all directions. At the beginning of the recovery, many people did not dare to return. The police station sent personnel to persuade the refugees in various places. Now, 90% of the people in the city have returned to their hometowns, and shops are gradually resuming business. In the past month, Japanese warships have been cruising back and forth in the waters off Dapeng, with varying numbers. The number suddenly increased the day before yesterday, with a total of seven ships. Motorboats are sent out during the day to patrol the coast, and searchlights are used to detect at night. The lights shine directly on Dapeng, as if they are spying. However, the local people are very calm, and the public order is also good.

### Kunshan: Great Compassion Hall of the North in Fond Remembrance

— Li Yinfei

One

"A small building, east wind again last night," evokes the feeling of "I cannot bear to look back on the moon in my homeland." The cold rain knocks on my thoughts, the fire in the stove barely red. On this silent night, it is easier to miss friends in distant lands. "Last year's weather, old pavilion," where are the partners who shared life and death in the past, now drifting to? Life in the Great Compassion Hall of the North was like a fire. After working for a day, thirty or fifty young people were reluctant to disperse after dinner. Lingering, everyone huddled around the candles on the table, talking endlessly about their ambitions and backgrounds, or, excitedly discussing a problem. It feels like it was just yesterday. However, what is the state of the Great Compassion Hall of the North now? Where are the partners who lived this kind of life together for more than half a month, now drifting? When they are marching, when they are resting, when they see the bright moon overhead, what are their feelings when they think of that warm and happy reunion life of half a month? —— The vision and state of mind of a warrior, only the elderly and the laggards of life have memories of the past, because they can only rely on warm memories to warm their chests that are about to cool. Are the companions still holding on to the unfinished candles and excitedly reviewing today's work?

Two

"Walking to the old courtyard gate, why knock lightly? There are no small dogs barking, only dry wells and dilapidated nests, but some brick moss and weeds, twigs of flowers and willows. Gather firewood at will, whose kitchen is this black ash?" —— Kong Shangren's "Lament for the Red South" "The Order of Peace" It is, I am old, why do I only have some memories?

In my memory, the Great Compassion Hall of the North is not like the "Order of Peace" that I quoted above. It is located on Baihua Street (Dream Flower Street) in Kunshan, less than a hundred steps away from Kunshan Park. The "morning bell and evening drum" (note) of Ma'anshan conveys warnings to us very clearly with the autumn wind.

The Great Compassion Hall of the North is a nunnery. The surroundings and interior easily remind us of the "Jingxiu Nunnery" at the beginning of Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q": "The white wall protrudes from the new green, and behind the low earthen wall is a vegetable garden." There is a bamboo forest leaning against the west wall, and there are also three lush osmanthus trees behind the nunnery. This is probably something that the Jingxiu Nunnery does not have.

When we moved in, the nuns in the nunnery had all gone to the countryside to take refuge. One room was sealed with a notice, and miscellaneous objects were piled up in a mess. The other rooms were empty.

We used the front main hall as a reception room and dining hall, and the rear main hall was converted into a dormitory. The nuns' living quarters were arranged for comrades to live in or used as offices.

We lived and worked together here. The hearts of thirty or fifty young people are connected into one, and the lives of thirty or fifty young people are also connected together. The boundary between you and me is eliminated, and the hypocrisy spread by the city is washed away. Loyalty and frankness are like the most loving fellow brothers.

What is especially unforgettable is the evening. The fatigue of working for a day is eliminated during dinner. It is still early before the scheduled bedtime. If there is no special duty in the evening, and the sky has a good moon, at this time, sitting at the table and guarding the candles, or going outside to take a walk to relax, telling each other about their experiences or expectations, becomes a pleasant habit.

Because life is pleasant, we also love the Great Compassion Hall, where we live with our partners. Every night, lying on the straw mat is warm and fragrant. When I wake up in the middle of the night, a piece of moonlight shines in through the window. The glass lamp in front of the shrine is dimly lit, and I can vaguely see the kind face of the Goddess of Mercy in the shrine. I feel as if I am sinking into poetry. The snoring of my partners becomes the rhythm of music. In this poetry and music, I vaguely and unconsciously fall into dreamland. —— And now, all of this can only be enjoyed in dreams.

Three

Has the Great Compassion Hall of the North become ashes now? Are the man-made defensive trenches still standing? In that bamboo forest, are the characters carved clumsily with a small knife still there?

Let everything be destroyed. We will build a new one on this old base. The crabs in Yangcheng Lake are fat, and the fresh and tender duck noodles are the best breakfast. Three or five of us young people will gather here, celebrate our victory here, and drink our triumphal wine here.

Four

"Helplessly, the flowers fall, seemingly familiar swallows return, I linger alone in the fragrant garden path" (Manshu, Washing Stream Sand). At this time and place, it is not only those suffering from homesickness who have difficulties to express, but also the sad season for travelers. But such days will not last long. In less than three years, we will become seemingly familiar returning swallows, retracing the land we once missed. Although the old one has been destroyed on this, the new one will be built exceeding the previous one.

We don't need to ask in what year and month we will be able to return to our homeland. What we need to ask is whether we have the determination to return to our homeland and what we are doing now.

Note: During the war, Kunshan used bells and drums on Ma'anshan to indicate air raid alarms. Bells were used for alarms, and drums were used to signal the all-clear. Because the mountain was not far from the war zone, alarms sounded almost every morning and were incessant until the evening. Therefore, my companions used "morning bells and evening drums" to describe it.

Of course, transportation in various parts of China is still difficult, and the travel industry in China is not yet widespread, but this war has already given us a good lesson. Looking at the place names in the newspaper, I only hate myself for not going to see them in peacetime.

But I have finally been to Huangshan, which is a small comfort in addition to my self-hatred.

I miss Huangshan, and I will always miss Huangshan.

### Shipping News

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japanese shipping has suffered a serious blow. Most of their merchant ships have been requisitioned back to the country. Therefore, the number of Japanese ships passing through Hong Kong has decreased recently. However, since the Japanese occupied Guangzhou, the number of Japanese ships passing through Hong Kong has increased sharply, averaging one or two ships entering the port every day. The Japanese ship ××, which ran aground in Hong Kong due to wind on September 1 last year, has also departed from Japan and will arrive in Hong Kong on the 15th of this month. It is expected that this will have a significant impact on the Pearl River shipping.

The Kma of Java Shipping Company arrived in Hong Kong from Singapore last night and berthed at Berth A5 in the Central District. It is reported that the ship needs to arrive in Singapore before the old Lunar New Year to transport goods from Hong Kong. The schedule has been slightly changed. It will depart for Xiamen at 7:00 this morning and will return to Hong Kong the morning after (the 11th). It will rush to Singapore that afternoon.

The Asian Queen of Changxing Company set sail from Hong Kong at noon today, heading to Shanghai, Japan, Chemdolly, and Hwas. The Russian Queen of the company is now scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong at 10:00 a.m. on the 10th of this month and depart for Little Luzon at 6:00 p.m. on the same day.

The Lishun Slave, an agent of the Melchers Trading Company, is now scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong from Shanghai at 7:00 a.m. on the 11th of this month and depart for Little Luzon, Shela, and various parts of Europe at 6:00 p.m. on the same day.

The President Conardage of American President Lines will arrive in Hong Kong from the Philippines the day after (the 10th) and depart for Shanghai, Japan, Honolulu, San Francisco, and Los Angeles at 8:00 a.m. the next morning. It is also reported that this ship's voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai is the first after the reorganization.

### The Wonderland of the English Island

— Pillow Moon

A Travelogue of Elden Castle

Since I arrived in England in the autumn of the 26th year [of the Republic], time has flown by like a swift steed. In the past six months, I have visited almost all the famous spots in London. However, there are still many unique and magnificent areas outside the capital that are worth seeing. I have always regretted not being able to visit them. The end of winter has passed, and spring has returned to the earth. My fellow countryman, Brother Yi Qiheng, is currently interning at the Stamford Electrical Company. Considering the mild weather since the beginning of spring this year, he plans to invite me for a day trip during the Qingming holiday. I gladly accepted. Stamford is a town in central England, about two hundred miles from the capital, accessible by a three-hour train ride. On the morning of April 24th, I went to Euston Station and boarded a Sunday excursion train. The regular third-class fare from London to Stamford is seventeen shillings and sixpence, but the round-trip excursion ticket on that day cost only seven shillings and ninepence. This is probably a special low price offered by the railway company to encourage tourists, a way to attract business. The train left London and traveled through vast and boundless plains. Distant mountains emerged, and the forests thrived. The lush greenery assailed the senses. Having lived in the city for a long time, I deeply resented the noise. At this moment, being in the countryside, I felt relaxed and detached, and worldly thoughts were cleansed.

I arrived in Stamford at 1 p.m., thirty minutes behind schedule. In addition to Mr. Yi, waiting at the station were Mr. Jian Yinguan, who was interning at the same factory as Mr. Yi, and Mr. Gao Deqiang and Mr. Lü Dekuan, who had just come to Stamford from Manchester. Mr. Gao is also from Nantong and studies textiles in Manchester. This was our first meeting. Mr. Jian is from Jiangdu, and Mr. Lü is from Dantu. It is a coincidence that the five of us belong to the same province. After eating out of the station, we strolled along the streets of Stamford. The town has a sparse population and undeveloped commerce. The city center is only a street less than half a mile long. What is noteworthy is the urban planning. Although it is a small town, it is not inferior to others in terms of municipal facilities. City hall, churches, parks, schools, and hospitals are all available, and the city appearance is particularly orderly. This is probably a general phenomenon throughout England. Mr. Yi told me that our itinerary for today is the nearby Elden Castle, about 20 miles from Stamford, which is known as the Wonderland of the English Island. In spring, summer, and autumn, tourists often tether their horses there. It is not only a famous area of Stamford but also a scenic spot throughout England.

The Stamford Motor Company, for the convenience of tourists, operates special tour buses on Sundays, which can carry passengers directly to the site. The bus was originally scheduled to depart at 2 p.m. Because it was chilly that day, there were few tourists. Besides the five of us, there was no one else. So we waited again and again. Finally, two Englishmen joined us. The bus can accommodate forty people, but now there are only seven. The meager income probably does not even cover the fuel costs. The bus left Stamford and traveled into the mountains. The highway undulated tortuously due to the varying terrain, and the steepness made people feel uneasy. The rural scenery of England frequently presented a picturesque view. Among the lush greenery, a corner of a red building occasionally appeared, partially hidden. These are the farmhouses of the farmers. It is said that throughout England, even in remote and impoverished areas, tap water, gas, and electricity are available. From this point of view, the comfort of life of English farmers is simply incomparable to that of our country.

The bus traveled for about an hour and arrived at Elden Hill. The trees were dense and the streams gurgled. The scenery was quite similar to Taoguang Bamboo Path in Hangzhou, while the winding mountain paths and flat roads resembled the Mausoleum Park in Nanjing. As I traveled here, I was filled with endless sorrow. Looking back at my motherland, I did not know where to start shedding tears. The bus drove straight up the mountain to a ticket office. Someone boarded the bus to sell tickets, one shilling per person, which meant we had reached the entrance to Elden Castle. After advancing another half a mile, the road curved, and we suddenly found ourselves in an open area. The ancient castle, majestically perched on the mountaintop, came into view.

The attractions of Elden Castle can be divided into two parts: the castle itself and the adjacent gardens. After getting off the bus, we first visited the famous garden. It is located to the left of the castle, between the mountains, in a secluded valley. The entire garden is laid out in this valley, covering about a hundred acres, with winding paths leading through it. A river runs through the middle, a confluence of mountain springs. Countless exotic flowers and rare plants are scattered throughout the garden, forming clusters of blossoms that are brightly colored and pleasing to the eye, like a natural painting. As we advanced along a small path, we saw a streak of silver shooting straight into the sky. Approaching it, we found an octagonal pavilion, about eight feet high, with three stories. Bells were hanging from the corners, seemingly imitating those of the East. The pavilion was in the middle of the river, and its top was fitted with a sprinkler. When the water was turned on, it shot out like splashing pearls and flying jade, and the white light reflected it, transforming it into five colors. It was the most spectacular view from afar and the most ingeniously designed feature of the entire garden. Afterwards, we saw a sign near the pavilion indicating that we could go to the Chinese Temple from there. We were overjoyed at this, as we did not expect to find such relics of our homeland in the fairyland of the English island, thirty thousand miles away. We gladly followed the path indicated, but after a long time, we could not find it anywhere. Looking around from a high vantage point, there was no sign of the temple. At that time, there was a three-story square tower built of cement by the side of the road. We decided to climb it to get a better view. But even after reaching the top, we still saw nothing. Disappointed, some of us jokingly said that perhaps the Chinese Temple was the very thing we were climbing. But the tower itself did not resemble a Chinese pagoda, let alone a temple. Just as we were about to descend the tower and search again, a Westerner happened to be holding a guidebook. Looking at it, we found that the Chinese Temple marked on the map was indeed the place we were climbing. The doubts in our minds were dispelled. Westerners often have a superficial understanding of Chinese things, making far-fetched associations. Now, seeing what they call a Chinese Temple, which is actually nothing like one, it is like calling a stag a horse. From this one instance, it can be seen that the number of such misunderstandings of China by these people is probably countless.

After descending the tower, we viewed the waterfall. The waterfall was not very large, but the slopes on both sides were planted with various flowers, creating a riot of color that was exceptionally beautiful. Being there, looking around, it felt as if we were in a book, truly a blessed place. At times, we saw a Western-style building in the forest across the mountain, with smoke curling upwards, suggesting that it was inhabited. Upon approaching it, we found that it was a Swiss chalet, a restaurant and lodging combined. We had some refreshments there. The hostess, Miss Johnson, and several waitresses greeted us with smiles and quickly seated the guests. Their innocent and gentle expressions made us feel relaxed and detached. The environment can indeed affect people in this way.

Leaving the garden, we arrived at a large lake where we could go boating. By this time, the setting sun was casting a thin glow. The lines of Bai Juyi, "The sun sinks, leaving a red shadow; the wind settles, leaving the green ripples still," best describe the scene. We then visited the ancient castle. The castle was a palace from the feudal era, entirely built of stone. The design was purely Gothic, incorporating high towers—round or square, tall or short—in various forms, all extremely beautiful. There was originally a moat outside the castle, spanned by a drawbridge. In the past, the drawbridge would be raised at night to prevent enemy attacks. Now the water has dried up, and the grandeur of those days is gone. The entire structure is far more majestic than the Tower of London. According to historical records, the mountain was originally the fief of the Earl of Harewood. Two hundred years ago, the earl spent a fortune building a large castle there as his residence. The earl died in 1827, before the project was completed. His descendants continued the work and finally finished it. In addition to the palace buildings, they also created gardens, spending a total of one million pounds, which was truly astonishing. Inside the castle, there were great halls, a church, a garden, and a painting studio, all extremely exquisite. Today, part of it has been converted into a restaurant. The magnificent palace, originally intended for the benefit of future generations, has undergone changes in less than two hundred years. How could the Earl of Harewood have ever dreamed of such a transformation?

To the right of the castle is a flag tower, also a tall stone tower, used for observation. We climbed to its summit, from which we could see the rolling hills in their entirety, truly the best spot on the entire mountain. After our tour, we returned to Stamford in the same bus. At two o'clock that night, I took the train back to London, arriving at dawn at five o'clock. In the faint moonlight, London was still sound asleep.

### A Poem

— Xu Shiying

The brilliant lights shine like stars,
The sea is vast and green in sight.
Passing through mountains of stone bamboo shoots,
A single leaf floats on the river's edge.

The wind and clouds surge without limit,
The mournful cries of geese are unbearable to hear.
Suddenly, an air raid warning is announced below,
Circling in the sky, unable to stop.

January 9th, Year 28 [of the Republic], departed from Hong Kong at night, rested in Guilin the next morning, and when about to arrive in Chongqing, there was an air raid warning, hovering in the sky for a long time before landing.

Old Man Shuangxi, February 2nd

### Travelogue of Huangshan (II)

— Huang Jiayin

The Mountains in Chinese Paintings

I am someone who likes painting, but since I am not good at it and have no opportunity to study painting, I can only try to read some books on painting theory and appreciate the works of great painters.

Perhaps it is because of my environment, I have always been deeply ashamed. Being born as a Chinese person, yet knowing nothing about Chinese painting, my personal understanding of painting is very superficial. But honestly, my ability to appreciate Western paintings is slightly stronger than my ability to appreciate Chinese paintings.

Due to my limited experience, I have always thought that Chinese landscape paintings are laughable. I even have a tendency to look down on Chinese painting, thinking that the high mountains and steep peaks shrouded in clouds and mist, the flying springs in the deep mountains, and the strange pines growing out of the cliffs are nothing more than the fantasies of Chinese painters. I thought that Chinese paintings are not realistic and that they have no significant value.

Since my trip to Huangshan, I have begun to respect Chinese books. My concept of Chinese painting has completely changed. Walking into the depths of Huangshan, what I see in front of me is not a magnificent Chinese landscape painting? Look, another one, and another one! There are simply endless Chinese paintings. Huangshan is truly a mountain in Chinese paintings. I am not traveling in Huangshan, I am traveling in Chinese paintings!

I Hate Myself

I am not someone who travels often. When I do travel occasionally, it is certainly more memorable, especially when the place visited is so memorable.

Since the outbreak of the war, I have hated myself. Seeing those familiar place names in the newspapers, so close, so important, so familiar, why didn't I go and visit them before?

### The Conspiracy to Destroy Our Silkworm Industry

— Wu Ma

The silkworm seed farm only has relations with the "Central China Silk Company." Not only are the amount and price of silkworm seeds determined by the "Company" at will, but the "Central China Company" can also directly exchange silkworm seeds for the farmers' legal tender, using military tickets or counterfeit money to fool the seed farm. In this way, isn't the silkworm seed farm just a puppet of the Japanese?

Regarding Article 5: it seems to be beneficial to the farmers, but when everything is in the hands of the Japanese, the silkworm seed farm is only responsible to the "Central China Silk Company." Therefore, the so-called compensation, in terms of procedure, is of course first the silkworm seed farm compensating the "Central China Silk Company," and then the "Central China Silk Company" compensating the farmers. In this way, after the end of a silkworm season, the seed price that the "Central China Silk Company" has to pay to the seed farm can be used as an example of poor performance, to justify defaulting on half of the seed price, and even forcing the seed farm to pay double the price of the loss. As for the farmers under the tyranny of the "Japanese puppets," they originally cannot avoid fleeing and escaping from the Japanese. Who dares to look for the Japanese because the silkworm harvest is not good? Even if, hypothetically, the Japanese really intend to compensate the farmers for their losses,

The Chinese team representatives have also been preparing for selection. According to investigations, the Chinese team lineup has been roughly determined and will be submitted at a meeting one day, and it will be finalized if approved. The determined lineup is as follows:

Zhang Rongcai (South China South)

Liu Han (Eastern)

Li Tiansheng (South China South)

Mai Shaohan (South China South)

Xu Jingcheng (Eastern)

Rong Zhao (South China South)

Song (Eastern)

The practice between the inter-port team captain and the Hong Kong team will be held at the Navy Ground at 5 pm tomorrow. At that time, representatives from both teams must be present. As for the entrance fee, it will be 20 cents for all. Also, the General Association received a letter from the Philippines team yesterday, stating that the team will arrive in Hong Kong early on the 12th of this month and arrive at approximately 2 pm, and will depart from Hong Kong on the 27th to return to the Philippines.

Also, regarding the Hong Kong-Macau inter-port soccer match, this year it is Hong Kong's turn to send a team. Yesterday, the General Association received a letter from Macau stating that this year's inter-port match is scheduled to be held in Macau on April 16, and requested that Hong Kong send all first-team players as representatives this time (in the previous two matches, the Hong Kong team sent only reserve players as representatives). After receiving the letter, the General Association will submit it for discussion at the next meeting. (Field Goal Taishui)

### Naval Status Increasingly High; Yesterday Yet Another Victory Over Middlesbrough; A Military Force of 1:2 Couldn't Prevail Despite Fierce Battle

Regular Cup Group A football league, yesterday at 4 PM, Middlesbrough and Navy met at the So Kon Po pitch. In the first week of competition, the American team lost to the Navy by a score of 3-4. Yesterday, they met on a narrow road, and the American team sought to avenge their previous defeat, fielding their full strength. Apart from changing the forward to Thomas, the rest remained as originally planned. The Navy team, having defeated Scots, saw their reputation further enhanced. On this day, they also deployed their elite forces. After the battle commenced, the American forces' momentum was quite loud, repeatedly pressuring the Navy's position. However, due to poor coordination among the forwards, they repeatedly missed good opportunities, allowing the Navy to counterattack with a score of 1-2. The Navy's forwards were quite active on this day, especially Ip, making rapid progress. The defenders also fulfilled their duties. Newland and Thorley vigorously blocked Middlesbrough's Nicolls' advance. Jackson performed quite well, repeatedly averting crises. Sheehan's defense was meticulous, repeatedly blocking the Navy's advance. The forward line's defense was weak, allowing the Navy to break through many times, which was also the cause of Middlesbrough's defeat. The battle situation is recorded as follows:

At the start of the match, the American team first applied pressure to the Navy's defense, but they were repelled. Kennedy attempted to break through Cooper's defense, standing and crossing the ball, but neither McVittie nor Mowatt were able to follow up in time. Jackson was able to calmly rescue Adair. At this time, the American team's morale was extremely high, and they attacked the Navy's defense again. Marabou and Pearson successively launched attacks, but were unable to find an opening. Five minutes later, the Navy team strove to improve. Thorley advanced on the left and right, McVittie and Mowatt mutually supporting each other. The American team's rear was in disarray. Dixon launched a long shot, but it went wide. The Navy, determined to win, with Armstrong and Thorley once again launching an attack. The ball reached the front of the American goal, and Mowatt headed it in, but Jackson's save was effective, and Weymouth escaped danger. After the American team cleared the ball, Weymouth, Bradley, and Fitchie covered the counterattack, and Pearson intruded and shot, but Thorley resolutely blocked him, and Pearson retreated. The Navy attacked again, but to no effect. Soon after, Dixon lofted a long ball in front of the goal, and Thorpe rushed forward to head it, but Jackson's quick save turned danger into safety. However, the team was still unable to clear the ball, and the Navy then won two corner kicks, but lacked the final touch to score. The American team decided to try to survive, with Thorley, Nicholls, and Guthrie advancing in three routes. The Navy had long prepared defenses, with Dixon, Fraser, and Hanneyway repelling them, and the American team was unable to advance. Their momentum then weakened. Thorpe received the ball and shot fiercely, passing over Henderson and Cooper desperately entangled him, but Thorpe had already lifted his leg and shot. Jackson could only sigh at his inability to reach it, and the Navy opened the scoring first, their vigor even stronger, frequently attacking the American goal. Before long, Thorpe returned, and Cooper and Sheehan vigorously resisted him. Thorpe accelerated and used the same technique again. Just as his head rose, Jackson dived to save, but the ball had already entered the net. The Navy won the second goal, their vigor like a bull, repeatedly attacking the American team. The first half ended with the Navy leading 2-0.

Switching sides and fighting again, the American team, facing a drastic change in fortunes, strenuously tried to strengthen their attack. However, the Navy's defense was tight, and there was no opportunity to take advantage of. Then, Kennedy got a corner kick, and the point of fall was particularly good. Mowatt headed it in, with great force. Fortunately, Jackson saved it, averting the danger. However, as one wave subsided, another rose. Thorpe, McVittie, Mowatt, Armstrong, Kennedy, and others attacked the goal in five routes. Fortunately, Jackson rushed out to save effectively, preventing them from losing again. After 30 minutes, Armstrong rose from the edge and shot a powerful shot. Jackson caught the ball and kicked it out. Patterson took charge, advancing on horseback. Marabou responded on the left, launching a quick shot, but it was ineffective. Mowatt launched a surprise attack, and Sheehan stepped forward to block. The ball was immediately fired, going into the air. The American team was in a crisis. Nicholls broke through, and Pearson was vigorously resisted by Thorley, but he was still able to shoot quickly, hitting the goalpost. Jackson turned around and saved, but the referee had already ruled that it had entered the net. The American team won back a goal, and their military power was slightly boosted. However, the Navy was unwilling to give in and resolutely counterattacked. McVittie waved his spear and advanced fiercely, and Henderson also responded with close combat, rushing into the position. Jackson dived to rescue, with many difficulties, finally escaping danger. From then on, the teams alternately attacked and defended, with no breakthroughs. At the end of the game, the American team lost 1-2. The lists are as follows:

Sheehan

Fitchie

Marabou

Nicholls

### YMCA Fitness Group Performance: Gymnastic Exercises; Held on the 11th Evening at 7 PM

[Special Report from this Newspaper] Given the current national crisis and the ongoing nationwide resistance against the enemy, physical training is truly an urgent matter.

### Film and Drama

Entertainment – The Rich Girl's Secret

There Goes My Heart

This is an American-style comedy. The story's material and plot arrangement are entirely for the purpose of achieving comedy. The director's surprising and winning techniques have created many fresh laughs for the audience in this film. The plot's crazy humor also has a very captivating power.

The film depicts the escape of a naive and freedom-loving rich girl, and how she falls in love with a reporter under special circumstances.

Fredric March and Virginia Bruce are not very clever comedians and have not achieved much in the film, giving only mediocre performances. Patsy Kelly is bright and cheerful, and has a very good performance, being a lovely clown. Nancy Carroll, who plays a vain and jealous shop assistant, is making her second comeback to the screen, and her performance is not bad.

Queen... If I Were King

If I Were King

The story is set in the era of King Louis XI of France. In a Paris with strong enemies outside and starving people inside, a poet and swordsman (Ronald Colman) becomes a leader among the rioting masses, killing strong enemies and governing the dynasty, with the deeds he does through courage and talent.

The entire film's performance is magnificent and grand, and all the characters are active and full of life. Among the main actors, Basil Rathbone as Louis is especially worth mentioning. The director did not handle the film very seriously, and the entire film is full of humor, which is a success. Coupled with the moving power of the story itself, the excitement of the plot, and the excellent performances of the actors, it is a successful and impeccable work.

Peace… Arizona Mahoney

Arizona Mahoney

This film can be said to be a martial arts film or a comedy, but both are terribly mediocre. The film is set in the American West, depicting how a woman unintentionally softens a group of bandits, while also interweaving a circus troupe that is too small to be true, and the troupe leader's funny performance. Apart from one or two scenes of struggle and humor, which can be slightly moving and make people laugh, the rest is not very good. It is a very old production from Paramount.

Orient… The Divorce of Lady X

The Divorce of Lady X

Produced by Alexander Korda of the United Kingdom, the story is set in a large hotel in London where a banquet is being held, which coincides with a heavy fog, preventing a group of VIPs from returning, and they borrow rooms in the hotel. Because there are too many people and too few rooms, a young lady breaks into a single man's room, and the story unfolds from there. The performance is extremely humorous and has a very American flavor. Merle Oberon's performance is just right. The male lead is a British star, and his performance is mediocre.

Tahua… Naughty Marietta

Naughty Marietta

An early work by Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, but it is not very successful. The songs are not as popular as those in their two films Rose Marie Maytime at that time. However, this film has won an award.

New World… Modern Woman Recruiting Husband (Cantonese film)

This is adapted from the stage play "Modern Woman Recruiting Husband". The plot tells the story of a Xuan Weng, who has millions in assets, but is extremely stingy. Not only does he not contribute a dime to any public welfare undertakings, but he also tries to take advantage of others. At this time, because all walks of life have launched a fundraising campaign to establish a refugee industrial plant, they want to ask him for help. However, as a result, not only did he not take out any money, but he also swiped a few Western pastries at the meeting. Therefore, everyone devised this "Modern Woman Recruiting Husband" method to trick him and then use feminine charm to lure him.

The main places are dance halls and red-light districts. Ma Shizeng and Tan Lanqing, also known for their dance, also eye the business prospects of this film.

The director's technique is still quite flexible.

Central... Wu Wai-kin Fights the Engine Room (Cantonese film)

Due to the exceptionally good box office performance of "Fang Shiyu Fights the Arena", smart filmmakers have spotted a business opportunity. This film is produced with that motive in mind.

Wu Wai-kin is weak and helpless and is bullied by people in the engine room. Forced by circumstances, Wu Wai-kin decides to leave the engine room and go to Shaolin Temple to learn martial arts so that he can avenge himself in the future. After many hardships and dangers, one day he finally returns and avenges his father. The plot of this film is that simple. The director has no technique to speak of. Kuang Shanxiao changes his style and plays Wu Huilian, and his performance is still acceptable. Xu Renxin has been away from the screen for a long time, and she is reprising her role in this film, and her performance is still good. The film's sets are too simple, and the fighting scenes at the airport are not tense.

Lee Theatre, Ko Shing Tong… Mulan (Cantonese film)

The plot depicts a modern woman who, because she has performed in the stage play "Mulan", always wants to be a modern "Mulan". Sure enough, when the country is in serious trouble, she fulfills her ambition. The reason is that she discovers a well-organized traitor organization, so she and her lover Kuang Shanzhu Xiao jointly try to crack this secret organization and steal documents. After countless difficulties, they finally achieve their goal, and even the clever and foolish traitors are moved by her great spirit and set off to the front line together.

We do not deny that this plot is one of the better ones in South China, but it is still quite far-fetched. The director cannot use the techniques of cinema, and the acting skills of Kuang Shanxiao and Chen Yunshang are lacking.

### Looking Back and Forward

— Lai Duanfu

Within the past week, from last Wednesday to yesterday, I considered the following absolutely joyful news: Our country resolutely decided to continue participating in this year's Davis Cup international tennis competition, and resolved to join next year's World Olympic Games to be held in Finland.

Japan, with ample time and composure, has long been actively training its tennis players, preparing to compete in the Davis Cup. Recently, the Domei News Agency deliberately publicized that it would transport large quantities of sports equipment to the troops fighting in China. All of this is another means of forcibly demonstrating to the outside world that the domestic situation is not as dire as rumored. Our country's finances are still much more abundant than Japan's. Regarding this kind of outward display, we naturally cannot lag behind in the slightest. Continuing to participate in the Davis Cup and further deciding to participate in the Olympic Games, which the aggressors cannot host nor participate in, is indeed a matter of utmost urgency. Those who say that useful national resources cannot be used for games not only fail to understand the importance of sports to humanity today but also fail to understand the trend of the international situation.

"It is permissible and also possible to do without… and it is harmful." Although participation in the Davis Cup is unavoidable, if, in addition to sending Xu Chengji and Cai Huiquan, who are currently the most successful and already in Europe, it is said that national resources should still be used to dispatch personnel from within the country, then that is something I cannot dare to agree with. This is because there are currently no tennis players in the country who meet international standards. However, if there are enthusiasts who can help the Xu brothers (Wei Pei and Run Pei) from Hong Kong to seize the opportunity to go to Europe for training and broadening their horizons, then that would be a great help. Wei Pei greatly improved after returning from a trip to Europe. Run Pei is only twenty years old and has never seen the world, but his skill is already enough to compete with his elder brother. Both of them have tennis talent. If they receive adequate cultivation, they both have the potential to gain international recognition within three years. I believe that enthusiastic wealthy people like Mr. Hu Wenhu should be responsible for cultivating these two.

Deciding to select and send the more promising football and basketball teams to the Olympic Games (note: there are already reports that basketball has been canceled for the next World Games; I wonder if there was a mistake in the telegram) can be said to be knowing what is urgent. Having learned from the lessons of the previous Games, we already know that these two sports are still not competitive enough on the world stage. Therefore, we should devise training plans as early as possible. Now, bandits are rampant in the inland areas, although they are only a nuisance and not enough to damage our military installations to any significant degree. However, they do hinder the centralized training of sports programs. Therefore, I believe that the Sports Commission should quickly establish a training division in Hong Kong, stationing committee members and selecting personnel to conduct active training. If sufficient preparations can be made in this way, then with the new spirit of China today, it is not impossible to leap to the world championship in football and basketball.

People in the sports world today often value championships too much, and thus spare no expense in luring talent to use for their own purposes. Gradually, schools also indulge athletes, neglecting the initial stages of training beginners, which is far from the original purpose of promoting sports. This is the reason why sports in our country have not progressed for a long time. Mr. Deng Jizhao, a committee member of the sports association, recently advocated canceling the overall championship, emphasizing the strengths of individual skills. He is a visionary with a long-term perspective.

The Chinese Athletic Association's handling of this year's football championship has been extremely shaky, which many people regret. However, I believe that the situation is self-inflicted and not worth regretting. Moreover, without a setback, the lethargic atmosphere cannot be drastically refreshed. This major setback is precisely enough to help them gather their determination to rebuild and work hard for a revival. This may not be a misfortune for the association. The skills of South China are still the best among all teams. One day when they rise up again, I dare to assert that there will still be no match for them in Hong Kong. If you don't believe me, just wait and see. As for South China, the right inside forward and left wing positions in the forward line are vacant. If they don't recruit talent from the B and C teams, they will inevitably decline. It is also useless not to train newcomers during this time when there is no hope for a championship. For the defensive line, it is still best to use Liu Weipei, Lin Depu, and Xie Jinhong.

The selection of representatives for the Hong Kong Interport football team against the Philippines the night before last was quite unexpected. In order to reluctantly include one player each from the Middlesex Navy and the Hong Kong Football Club, they did not hesitate to reverse positions, reducing their combat capabilities. This aptly describes acting based on emotion rather than selecting people based on skill. Li Tiansheng is suitable for both the left and right sides, and Liang Rongzhao can easily handle all three center-back positions, so changing positions is not a problem. However, since it is known to use Hou Rongsheng in the combined team, then why not use Li as the left inside forward and let Hou take on the left or right position, which would be better? If Liang Zhaorong moves to the left, then why not still use Liang as the right forward and fill the left position with Xu Jingcheng, which would be excellent. Fula has never played as a right winger, and forcing him to fill the new vacancy is truly like cutting the feet to fit the shoes. However, according to recent performances, if people are selected based on skill, then the Zheng team will inevitably become a combined Zhongpu team. This can only be achieved with great sportsmanship. If people are indeed selected based on recent performances, then both teams will have the following lineups:

(Interport Team)

Tan Jun'gan

Xu Jingcheng (Eastern) Hou Chengtuo (Eastern Athletic Association)

Li Tiansheng (South China) Gao Shannu (St. Joseph's)

South China (Beaulieu St. Joseph's) Li Huitang (South China)

Hou Rongsheng (Guanghua) Feng Jingxiang (South China)

Liang Rongzhao (South China) Deng Guangsen (South China)

(Hong Kong Combined Team)

Liu Xianhan

Hanni Boru (Kowloon) Yachen (Kowloon)

Wulieqi (Kowloon) Jin Shi (St. Joseph's)

(Eastern Athletic Association) Dixon (Navy) Chen Dehui (South China)

Mai Shaohan (South China) Zuo Zhi (Kowloon)

Song Lingsheng (Eastern) Yang Shuiyi (South China)

Yesterday, the Navy played Middlesex at the Happy Valley field. The Navy fought exceptionally bravely and dominated the entire game. If the shooting in the first half had not been inaccurate, they would have won by more than five goals. The new goalkeeper Dickson and the central defender Wu Beinei are both talented. This is probably not good news for the Chinese teams. I advise South China and Eastern to quickly work hard and practice diligently if they want to win the championship. Otherwise, the championship title may ultimately belong to the Navy.

### Literary Front

— Huang Sheng

"Can you accelerate the heartbeat of life? Can you, as others have done, stir life up into a force?" This quote from Gorky can serve as a warning to all "fighters," and as a motto for literary workers who are also "fighters." It is especially meaningful and cautionary to say this to Hong Kong literary workers.

Literature is a reflection of reality grasped and refined by the author. Strictly speaking, a literary work should be a crystallization of the author's heartbeat, a product born after enduring the labor pains of creation. Literary workers, as one of the "fighters," use their subjective reflection of objective reality to raise a force for improving society. The main goal is to "help people understand themselves, increase their faith in themselves, and develop their thirst for truth" (Gorky). They must "accelerate the heartbeat of life."

The War of Resistance has caused many literary workers to devote themselves to a new struggle. The literary front has become a constituent part of the entire resistance front interwoven in the resistance camp. The new struggle is a burning furnace, with ever-increasing flames and stars scattering at different moments. In short, it is a rich object for grasping and refining, enriching the creative life of literary workers and enabling them to "accelerate the heartbeat of life." Therefore, they have already "stirred up a force." Thus, we follow up with the opening Gorky quote to solicit answers from Hong Kong literary workers.

It is indeed not easy for Hong Kong literary workers to give a good answer. Of course, they can simply and bravely answer: "Yes, we can!" And they must answer in this way, because "whether we like it or not, the responsibility has fallen on our shoulders." However, this can only be regarded as a bold statement at the beginning of their journey?

For more than a year, the literary garden in Hong Kong has still been somewhat barren. Not only is it uncultivated, but many places are also overgrown with seductive poisonous weeds. The work of planting and weeding must be done simultaneously. Hong Kong, as a major overseas station of cultural power, cannot allow the establishment of a literary front to be delayed.

Naturally, literary workers are isolated on this island, unable to be scorched by the ever-increasing flames, and not easily able to see the stars scattering at different moments. However, it is not only works that write about battles and heroes that are valued now; works that write about the struggle and people in the rear are equally highly regarded.

Perhaps some people feel that living on this isolated island is too ordinary. Facing this ordinary and licentious society, how should we write? Yes, a child cannot be born without pregnancy. A false pregnancy can only release a burst of air. But Goethe tells us: "Do not say that reality lacks poetic flavor; because the poet is a poet because he has the talent to bring ordinary objects to the surface of interest." This "talent" is actually not mysterious, but is able to "see development." "Those who do not see development will never see the truth! Because the truth is not as it is, and does not stop moving forward, but is leaping: truth is progress, is contradictory; is struggle" (Lunacharsky). As long as one can see the development of "truth," the creation of literary workers will gain a source and axis. "Truth is progress, is contradictory, is struggle." This determines that literary workers who are isolated on the island can also "accelerate the heartbeat of life" and "stir up a force."

For more than a year, Hong Kong society has been leaping forward. It is home to 1.5 million Chinese people and has become China's wartime "special rear." It is developing from contradictions, and in the process of development, it constantly presents extraordinary situations. If one can portray this development, creation will not be a problem. A group of leaping waves. This is a sign of the development of reality. Isn't this ready-made material for writing? This is one example. Moreover, Hong Kong has become a gathering place for backward elements. They nakedly and unscrupulously show their various phases. Can't we create one or more typical characters to portray them?

From now on, Hong Kong's literary workers should step up their activities! The literary front should be established!

### Cold Night

— Li Ruochuan

Written for the third month anniversary of M's imprisonment

Lonely window,

Lonely eaves.

Tonight,

Responding to the cold wind,

An angry roar occurs.

In the courtyard,

On the beach,

Moonlight like water.

A crow flies over,

A fallen leaf floats down from an empty branch.

Gently,

Awakening the dreams of those longing for home.

Friends who go to difficulty!

You are in the prison mountains that have lost freedom

In,

Listening to the wind

Looking at the moonlight

As if being on the battlefield,

Dancing swords and waving halberds,

Ten thousand troops sing together,

Can this promote the revenge of your ambition?

Friend,

In the cold night,

I have no home

Cannot blindly dream of home.

In order to remember you,

I am a short-term sufferer,

In the cold wind,

Dare not shiver,

As if calculating the years with you.

Counting:

First watch,

Second watch,

Third watch.

### In the Trenches

— Qiu Yang

—One of the Wartime Notes—

Outside the gray Zhanjiang, maple leaves dyed half of the mountain red.

The afternoon autumn sun bathes the mountains and rivers in the distance, the wind whispers, bringing bursts of bloody smell, stroking the ripe sorghum, stroking the soldiers' single clothes, making them tremble a little!

The highway, which had long been destroyed, had no pedestrians, no mules and camels, only a trench, perpendicular to the highway, all the way to the foothills a few miles away, covered with withered yellow leaves, and several iron wire nets were laid on the outside.

The surrounding air was very silent, only the scattered gunfire, like firecrackers played by children on the Lantern Festival, punctuated this temporary silent trench.

After two days and nights of fierce fighting, both sides suffered heavy casualties. Those who were not killed or injured were so tired that they were about to die. They all retreated to their respective positions, temporarily stopping the charge and wrestling. The brothers were squatting in the trench, their backs against the wet mud wall of the trench, their guns resting beside them, closing their heavy eyelids, and constantly yawning. But everyone dared not fall asleep, wary of a sneak attack.

Zhao Dazui, who was particularly fond of talking, was telling the story of how brave he was! Although it was thrilling, bizarre and a little moving, the only responses he got were careless acknowledgements, and sometimes no one responded to him at all, but he continued to talk regardless of whether anyone was listening or not. White saliva hung on the corners of his mouth, which was covered with a beard, and his dusty and thin face had an excited glow, as if he was telling the story of bravely killing and forgetting the fatigue of not resting for a few days. As he spoke, he was a bit like the person selling "medicine that can cure a hundred diseases" on the Hong Kong ferry, talking and laughing to himself.

"Zhao Lan, be quiet! Your cannon is far worse than the enemy's."

A cold sneer, like an impatient tone, rang out in the trench, and everyone smiled, even Wang Huzi, who was about to fall asleep, grinned.

"Okay—Liu Ermaozi, you see, if I don't kill ten or eight of them this time, you can come and make fun of me." Zhao Dazui opened his mouth even wider, scattering white saliva everywhere, and also involving some of his personal romances.

A heavy rumbling of motors was heard in the distance, and the brothers stood up, leaning their heads towards the outside of the trench, and even Zhao Dazui stopped talking. Saying a word, "Anyway, it's the same old trick," he squatted down, held his gun, and remained silent.

Three enemy planes painted with red dots were approaching closer and closer at a low altitude of seven hundred feet. The sound of the motors shattered people's eardrums, and the sound of metal colliding with air made people's hearts tense and excited. The brothers squatted down, each holding their guns, hooking the machine guns, and staring upwards through the gaps in the branches with eyes covered in blood. Suddenly, there was a burst of black in front of them, and yellow dust rushed into the sky, broken stones and scrap iron flew in all directions. The brothers' ears rumbled and they could not hear anything, but in their hurried breathing, they smelled a strong smell of sulfur.

The enemy plane left after dropping the bombs—the dust rushed into the sky and was blown away by the crazy wind—the brothers' ears were also gradually recovering their hearing, but what followed was not the rumbling of motors, but the fierce artillery and machine guns, the bullets streaked across the clear sky, whistling past.

The order from above came down, saying "Prepare to charge"—the brothers became excited again, forgetting the fatigue just now. They tightened their legs, tightened their bullets, inserted their sabers, and waited in the trenches for the order to charge.

"Useless Liu Ermaozi, watch me kill a dozen Japanese devils for you!" Zhao Dazui's mouth was frothing even more, he—hand grabbed Liu's clothes, one hand holding the gun, his mouth roaring again.

### On Children's Books

— Han Bo

At present, in terms of children's cultural food, in addition to the continued existence of a serious "book shortage" phenomenon, there are also several things that should not be neglected, pressing heavily on children's minds, blocking the bright side like iron gates, causing them to passively look at unintelligible and meaningless books, or simply not see books at all.

In general superficially novel families, parents treat children as adults, giving them to read books that are either "masterpieces" by famous people or foreign classics, as if this is the only way to make children progress. However, the achievements promoted by this are only to drive the brothers into a fog, and even ruin their fragile foundations. I once saw a friend forcing his eleven-year-old child to hold "The Call to Arms and Wandering" all day long and read it to death, and punishing him if he didn't understand (I dare to bet that the friend himself had never read a single word of Mr. Lu Xun's works), so the child always looked sad and frowned. Not to mention the profound and unpredictable meaning, he couldn't even recognize all the characters, at most he could only tell you that the madman in the madman's diary was "very interesting," that's all.

The second kind of antique figure is to underestimate the children too much, thinking that children are still wet behind the ears, what novels or "idle books" do they want to read? Just memorize the textbooks, at most when the children are bored or naughty, they will find a few Journey to the West and Investiture of the Gods and throw them to them, saying casually: "Don't make noise, watch Sun Wukong and Jiang Taigong fight, it's very interesting," so the children really immerse their thoughts in absurd and magical novels, unaware of the Han Dynasty, no matter Wei Jin, like smoking opium.

There are also some enlightened parents who plan for their children every day, running to bookstores and book stalls, busy all day long, but the results they get are extremely pitiful. When they have finished reading the only few excellent children's books in the country, such as Biao, Documents, Scarecrow, and Adventures of Pinocchio, they have to retreat and seek the next best thing. When the "next best" is exhausted, the parents are disheartened and feel that their responsibilities have been fulfilled, so they simply don't ask about "children's affairs" anymore, letting the children go to the garbage dump and pick out whatever treasures they can and enjoy whatever they can, so we can also greatly discover this group of blind children riding blind horses at the stall.

As for the education of poor children, because there are many discussions, I will temporarily omit it here.

Summarizing the above points, although they all focus on the lack of proper and reasonable guidance for children, the problem of children's book shortage is mutually increasing and decreasing with it. Good guidance can reduce the reverse effect of books, and good books can naturally make the guides understand the truth and be easy to engage in. Therefore, we first hope that the family fears correct their own distorted children's concepts, treat children as people with children's characteristics, - that is to say, they can only read books and articles written by children. And need appropriate instructions, this responsibility should be borne by parents: Secondly, we hope that cultural workers will consider more for the children, take out some time, write and translate several more living and beautiful books, as a gift to the War of Resistance to give to them, not only save parents a lot of trouble, that is, in the future this group of children grow up will also be grateful.

### The Eastern River Frontline

Written by the Guangdong Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team

(III) Bearing the Arduous Task of Responsibility

A very unfortunate phenomenon occurred here. Before even reaching Heyuan—the first stop on the Eastern River—most of the comrades were plagued by illness. In this difficult and materially lacking team, the lack of medicine and nutrition particularly intensified the suffering of the sick. At this stage, we not only had to take on the responsibility of resisting Japan, but also had to engage in a struggle against the demons of disease. As a result, although the demons of disease were driven out of our territory, our meal money was swallowed up by them. The entire team's finances were at their most depleted. Magistrate Huang of Heyuan County showed us great care and help, allowing sick comrades to be admitted to local hospitals for treatment and also solving the food and clothing problem for some of our comrades.

In Heyuan, we began to take on the heavy burden of our work. One-third of the comrades were assigned to various district self-defense corps to take on political training work. At the same time, a mobile propaganda team from the Anti-Japanese Vanguard appeared in the crossroads of Heyuan City, performing street plays. They appeared gaunt and pale, singing desolate and tragic songs of exile, which moved the onlookers, who all thought they were genuine refugees. So, they generously threw copper coins and banknotes on the ground to help the refugees. We then sent this money to the refugee shelter.

Two-thirds of the comrades continued to advance eastward, stopping for ten days in Guzhu Lu, Zijin. Guzhu has a revolutionary tradition and a history of great struggle. Although the atmosphere had been quiet for a long time, our arrival stirred up their enthusiasm like a raging tide.

Just as we were working vigorously and intensely, news suddenly came that Huizhou had been recovered. This certainly made us rejoice, but in Huizhou, which had been ravaged by the [Japanese] invaders, how devastated and chaotic would it be? How much it needed people to work! So, we had no choice but to leave the enthusiastic youth of Guzhu and advance towards Huizhou.

Indeed, we were so bound by their enthusiasm that we could not bear to leave them idle. We decided to leave five comrades to continue working for ten days and added more than thirty new Anti-Japanese Vanguard comrades, establishing the Anti-Japanese Vanguard Zijin Guzhu Lu Unit.

The boat slowly sailed eastward, with people on the shore and on the boat responding to each other. Farewell, farewell comrades, we will meet again on the front line—songs shattered the morning air. The people seeing us off went one step and then another, one mile and then another. This enthusiastic expression of the Guzhu youth was, more than for us, for the country and its people!

Facing the ancient city of Huizhou, trampled by the iron hooves of the [Japanese] invaders, it was already scarred beyond recognition. The only Dongxin Bridge spanning the Eastern River, connecting the two sides of the county seat, had been crippled and fallen into the raging Eastern River. This was the souvenir left by the [Japanese] invaders when they left. The prosperous commercial district! Shuidong Street, had become a rubble field. The charming West Lake was covered in a layer of greyish-purple color, and the evening breeze carried a fishy and foul smell. The beauty of the lake and mountains had faded, and Xizi (West Lake) was indeed ashamed to be seen. All of this humiliation, the Eastern River with its revolutionary tradition! Why didn't you show a little of your true colors? Xizi, why didn't you exert your spirit and allow the brutal human demons to ravage you at will? Facing the humiliated West Lake, the masses who were slaughtered in large numbers, and the remains of the buildings that were burned down, ignited a heart-rending fire of anger in them!

Driving away the [Japanese] invaders and cleaning up the broken mountains and rivers to rebuild is what we are willing to do and must do. Now the comrades are scattered in the army to work. Training young people, mobilizing the masses to participate in guerrilla warfare, and strengthening the political training work of the army are the work we have done and continue to do. The enemy's retreat from Huizhou this time clearly shows that they do not have enough troops to allocate. It is very likely that they will return to counterattack. How should we prepare, strengthen the people's strength, expose the enemy's political conspiracies, and give them a head-on blow when the enemy turns around? The Eastern River is in such an important position.

In the past three months of work, although the Anti-Japanese Vanguard comrades have done their best, it cannot be denied that the Anti-Japanese Vanguard has many weaknesses. In particular, the lack of cadre talents is a factor that makes it difficult to carry out work. We hope and sincerely welcome enthusiastic young people to join our ranks, to jointly take on and develop our arduous task of responsibility. We also hope that comrades working in various places will give us more instructions and help in our work. The Anti-Japanese Vanguard is a small child hiding in a corner and needs so much cultivation and guidance!

Sent from Huizhou City on the 26th of the first month, the 28th. (The End)
