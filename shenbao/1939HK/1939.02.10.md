### The Japanese Plunder of the Entire Economic Landscape of Central China

— Gu Xiaohui

The Japanese are now actively engaged in economic aggression in the occupied areas of Central China, organizing the so-called "Central China Development Corporation." Using the principle of "one industry, one company," they are establishing various subsidiaries to monopolize all industries in Central China, including agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation, and electricity. Their aim is to seize all economic power within the war zone in their dealings with China, exclude international interests in China from outside, and exploit the people's economy and promote it in China for their own benefit. In short, they plan to extract the economy of the occupied areas to compensate for Japan's financial shortcomings, to carry out their long-term war against China, and to completely derive the supplies for the Japanese army in China from the Chinese people themselves, as can be seen in Itagaki's recent response to the members of the Diet.

Based on my own investigation, and the records in Chinese, English, and Japanese newspapers, I will now describe the methods of the Japanese economic aggression in Central China, the organization of various aggressive institutions, and the state of the occupation of various industries in Central China. I will write this piece to let everyone see the whole story of the Japanese economic aggression in Central China, so that our people know that this so-called aggressive action of forcible occupation and bullying will not succeed if we do not agree to it, and that one day we will recover our old possessions.

1. The So-called "Central China Development Corporation" (?)

In the Northeast, we know that Japan had a so-called "South Manchuria Railway Company" (Mantetsu), which the Japanese themselves called the vanguard of the colonization of the Asian continent. After 1918, within a few years, all kinds of economic rights outside the customs were in its hands. After August 13th, Japan adopted this policy again and established two new companies on November 7th last year: one was the so-called "North China Development Company" for North China, and the other was the so-called "Central China Development Corporation" for Central China. Like Mantetsu, these two organizations are "national policy companies" recognized by the Japanese government. This article will only discuss the "Central China Development Corporation."

The "Central China Development Corporation" was established according to the resolution passed by the 73rd Japanese Diet on April 28th last year. After it was established in Tokyo on November 7th last year, the head office was said to be located in Shanghai (but it has not yet been realized). The company's capital is 100 million Japanese yen, contributed equally by the Japanese government and private sector. Its first paid-up capital was 31,382,344 yen, divided as follows:

Japanese Government – 18,882,344 yen
In-kind contribution – 7,640,000 yen
Cash – 11,242,344 yen
Private Shares – 12,500,000 yen

But sadly, this private capital was raised over a long period of four months, divided into 100,000 shares, with as many as 9,770 shareholders participating. And the money raised was only over 1.2 million.

The company's organization, in addition to many subsidiaries, is divided into three sections and one office, as follows:

Shanghai Head Office
(Subsidiaries)
General Affairs Section
Commercial Affairs Section
Business Investigation Section
(Tokyo Branch)

The important person in charge, the president, is appointed by the Japanese government, Kodama Kenji. This old man was the Japanese president of the so-called Sino-Japanese Trade Association before the war. We all remember a few years ago when he came to Shanghai to celebrate with wine at the International Hotel, singing about Sino-Japanese economic cooperation! Now the fox's tail is revealed, and it turns out that so-called "cooperation" is like this. Anyone who is fascinated by the dream of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation should also wake up. Now, let's list the important persons in charge of this company:

President: Kodama Kenji (Former General Manager of Yokohama Specie Bank)
Vice President: Hirazawa Kaname (Former Vice Minister of the Ministry of Communications)
Director: Kanai Kiyoshi (Former Commissioner of South Manchuria Railway Company)
Sonoda Saburo (Former Foreign Affairs Manager of Yokohama Specie Bank)
Yutani Kyoichi (Former Director of Sino-Japanese Industrial Association)

As mentioned above, the establishment of this company is actually a general mechanism for exploiting Japanese private capital and representing the Japanese government's economic aggression against China. The aggression is implemented by its subsidiaries. The establishment of subsidiaries follows the principle of one company per industry, and all industries are controlled by the company in that industry. The goal is to control the entire industrial and commercial hub of Central China, exclude European and American interests in China, and make China its economic appendage, like an ancient serf, and prevent it from ever entering the modern industrial path.

The details of the company's control of various industries will be written later. Now, let's talk about the activities of Kodama Kenji, the mastermind of the company.

2. Kodama Kenji's Activities in China

After the establishment of the "Central China Development Corporation," Kodama Kenji made a statement to a Reuters reporter in Tokyo, wanting to induce the United Kingdom and the United States to invest in its controlled area, and therefore denied control and monopoly. First, Kodama said, "The company is not controlled by the army, and it is completely commercial in nature." This is a complete lie. It is clearly one of Japan's "national policy companies" against China. Kodama himself was appointed by the Japanese government. According to Tokyo itself, the Japanese government has the power to supervise the company, has the power to cancel the company's resolutions, has the power to appoint and remove the company's responsible persons, and can issue various necessary orders in national defense or other necessities. This shows that Kodama's words are all lies. In fact, this company is the representative of the Japanese government, and the responsible persons inside are the pawns of the warlords. Second, he said, "The company has no intention of monopolizing," which is completely fooling people. Looking at "Mantetsu" in the Northeast, it has completely excluded all international interests from "Manchuria" to this day. Close to North China, the control of cotton is nominally by the puppet organization, but isn't it actually this so-called "North China Development Company"? Again, in Shanghai and inland waterways, since the establishment of the Japanese "Inland River Shipping Company," it has been completely monopolized. The "Inland River Shipping Company" is a subsidiary of this company. Foreign shipping companies have indeed negotiated with the Japanese for passage permits, but they cannot obtain them to navigate the inland rivers. There are many other industries like this, isn't that enough to prove his control? At the same time, Japanese newspapers all admit that the policy of controlling Chinese industry and commerce will be the center of attention from now on. Third, Kodama said: "Shanghai is much more prosperous, and Japanese commerce has developed accordingly, and there is no reason why foreign commerce should not expand alone." This is their attempt to lure the United States to invest in Central China to complete its development conspiracy. However, all parties ignored Kodama's remarks, and he left Tokyo for Shanghai to work in this situation.

Kodama arrived in Shanghai on the Miyazaki Maru on November 26th last year. At the same time, the company's Vice President Hirazawa and directors also came. They held so-called "Sino-Japanese economic cooperation measures" with the puppet side in Hongkou, including:

(1) Expanding the strategy of the Development Corporation.
(2) Establishing the Japan-China Bank.
(3) Issuing counterfeit money.
(4) Promoting military currency.
(5) Other control matters.

On November 30th, he went to Nanjing from Shanghai to discuss cooperation methods with the highest Japanese military commander; and convened a meeting of the puppet governors of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces in Nanjing to discuss their so-called "cooperation" methods. In fact, it was just asking a few puppets what they had that could be plundered. It is said that Kodama will live in Shanghai for a long time, but his plan to establish the Japan-China Bank and issue counterfeit money has failed due to the righteous refusal of Chinese and foreign banks. The promotion of military currency, after he arrived in Nanjing, has been agreed with the Japanese side and has been implemented since November 30th last year. That is, the issuance of new military currency in the occupied areas to replace bank notes, a plundering policy of buying goods with waste paper.

3. Establishment of Various Controlled Companies

Regarding the various subsidiaries established by the Japanese to control various industries, before the "Central China Development Corporation" was established, and before Kodama came to Shanghai, many companies had already been established under the "entrustment" of the Japanese army. Later, when the "Development Corporation" was established, each company became its subsidiary. After Kodama came to China, several new ones were established.

(1) Controlling inland river shipping, the "Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company" was established on July 28th last year, with a capital of 2 million Japanese yen. The Japanese "Central China Development Corporation" contributed 600,000 yen, and Nisshin Kisen Kaisha contributed 400,000 yen, totaling 1 million. The remaining 1 million was used to evaluate the plundered Chinese property as 1 million to serve as equity capital. The company uses the control of the inland river routes of Central China as its name, and currently has 75 steamships and 70 boats. All important routes in Central China are chartered by the company.

(2) On July 31st last year, the "Central China Electric Communication Co., Ltd." was established with a capital of 15 million Japanese yen. The "Central China Development Corporation" contributed 6 million, the International Electric Communication Corporation 2 million. Japan Telegraph and Telephone Corporation 1 million, Japanese Electric Company, Sumitomo Electric Wire Company, Furukawa Electric Industries, Fuji Electric Wire Company, Oki Electric Company, a total of 1 million, totaling 10 million, and the remaining 5 million, which was used to plunder the various original telecommunications equipment and industries of Central China, converted into the equivalent amount. The company operates Central China's telegraph, telephone, and external radio communication business in Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, etc., all urban areas and all remaining wired, wireless, telegraph, telephone, and coordinated operations, and also plans to expand wireless radio and other businesses to Nanyang, Europe, and the United States, as well as submarine telegraphs in North China. Long-distance telephone between Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou, and wireless telephone between Shanghai and Tokyo, have been connected.

(3) "Central China Hydroelectric Co., Ltd." was established on June 30th last year. The head office is located in Shanghai, President Aoki Tsumoru, with a capital of 25 million Japanese yen. The "Central China Development Corporation" contributed 7.5 million, and the "Central China Electric Power Company" contributed 2.5 million, totaling 10 million Japanese yen. The remaining 15 million was plundered from Chinese power equipment, which was converted into 9 million yuan, and equipment from other water utilities was converted into 6 million yuan, totaling 15 million yuan.

(4) Plundering the iron production of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the "Central China Iron Ore Co., Ltd." was established on April 8th last year with a capital of 20 million yuan. The "Central China Development Corporation" contributed 4.5 million, the Japanese Railway Department 3 million, Japan Steel Pipe Tsurumi Iron Works, Kokura Steel, Nakayama Steel Manufacturing, Sino-Japanese Industrial Company, etc. contributed a total of 2.5 million yuan, and the remaining 10 million yuan was used to convert the mineral production of about 20 iron ore areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces into 10 million yuan, which was plundered to serve as half of the equity capital.

The plan is to first mine the Taochong iron ore area between Nanjing and Wuhu, and between Taiping and Tongling. The Taiping iron ore is the target for the first mining operation. The first annual plan is to mine 1 million tons of iron ore, which has been carried out in the Tu'ao Mountain and Nanshan areas. Now, an average of 500 tons of iron ore is mined every day. The first ship of 7,000 tons was shipped from Ma'anshan on October 26th last year, the second ship of 3,000 tons was shipped on the 31st, and the third ship was shipped to Japan on November 10th.

(5) Opening long-distance buses in the occupied area of Central China, the "Central China Urban Bus Co., Ltd." was established on November 5th last year. The head office is located in Shanghai with a capital of 3 million Japanese yen. The Xingzhong Corporation, Dazhi Automobile Company, Jiangnan Industrial Company, etc. jointly contributed 2.5 million, paying half of it first. The remaining 500,000 was replenished with the plundered Chinese physical objects. The company's business scope includes the seven cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang, specializing in urban public buses, as well as intercity long-distance buses and truck transportation. In the concession north of Suzhou Creek in Shanghai, it also occupied the exclusive rights granted by the Public Concession Authority to the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, and opened public buses in the cross-border road construction area. Another company will be established separately to specialize in long-distance buses.

(6) Controlling the sericulture, silkworm, silk reeling mill agriculture and industry in Central China, the "Central China Sericulture Co., Ltd." was established. The head office is located in Shanghai, established on August 10th last year with a capital of 8 million Japanese yen (some Japanese say it is 10 million Japanese yen, anyway, they are all bragging, no matter what). The "Central China Development Corporation" contributed 6 million, paying half of it first, and using the industrial assets of silk reeling mills in Central China to make up for the estimated 2 million Japanese yen.

The company's intentions:
(1) To operate machine reeling silk business. (2) To operate the manufacture and distribution of silkworm eggs. (3) To operate silk hand-reeling industry. (4) To sell local silk. (5) To carry out the above related affairs.

At the same time, Wang Zihui, the "Chairman of the Executive Yuan of the Reformed Government," sold silk reeling mills in Shanghai, Wuxi, Suzhou, Zhenzhou, Huzhou, Jiaxing, Haining, Deqing, and other places to the Japanese when he went to Japan, and signed a satisfactory agreement with the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry:

(A) The production of silkworm cocoons in Central China must be increased to the pre-war level, and the number of silk reeling machines should be limited to about 10,000. (B) The reeling and distribution of silk cocoons shall be managed by the "Central China Sericulture Company." (C) Japanese silk reeling mills should specialize in reeling higher-quality silk of 20 to 22 deniers and 13 to 15 deniers, while Chinese silk reeling mills should specialize in reeling coarse silk of 20 to 22 deniers. (D) Select special silk cocoons for use in North China and Japan. (E) The export inspection and control of raw silk in North China shall be handled by the "Central China Development Corporation." (F) Hand-reeled silk should be encouraged, and efforts should be made to promote new uses for silk cocoons. A separate company will be established in the future to manage the production of special cocoons. (G) The sericulture industry in Shanxi will adopt the same policy as Central China.

(7) On December 28th last year, the "Central China Gas Company" was established. The head office is located in Shanghai with a capital of 3 million yuan. The "Central China Development Corporation," Shanghai Hengchan Company, Hiroshima Gas Co., Ltd., Tokyo Gas Chemical Industry Co., etc. contributed 2.5 million yuan, paying a quarter of it first, and using the plundered Chinese industrial assets, converted into 500,000 yuan, to fill the remaining shares. The people in charge of the company: Managing Director Toyoshima Aimei (former director of Hiroshima Gas Electric Railway Co., Ltd.), Director Chen Shaoqi (managing director of Shanghai Hengchan Company), Ishikura Kichiji (former managing director of Tokyo Gas Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), Supervisor Fei Mingyu.

(8) To control the shipping industry on the Yangtze River, the "Yangtze River Shipping Company" was established. It was founded on December 10th last year with its head office in Shanghai. It has not yet started business. The amount of capital is unknown. The "Central China Development Corporation" and Nisshin Shipping Company, Dalian Steamship Company, etc. invested in it, and plundered the wharves of Chinese shipping companies along the Yangtze River as capital to monopolize all shipping operations at various ports along the Yangtze River, owning 16 riverboats and excluding British shipping companies.

(9) Seizing Shanghai's real estate, the so-called "Reconstruction of the War Zone," the "Shanghai Hengchan Company" was established on September 1st last year. The head office is located in Shanghai with a capital of 2 million yuan. The "Central China Development Corporation" contributed 1 million yuan. To seize the public land and real estate of the former Shanghai Municipal Government, etc., converted into 1 million yuan, to fill half of the capital. It is said that the company will start with Shanghai and plan to build urban areas, roads, and ports, etc., in order to transform Shanghai and control the concessions.

(10) Seize the fish production along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and establish the "Central China Aquatic Products Co., Ltd." It was established on November 6th last year. The head office is located in Shanghai with a capital of 1.33 million Japanese yen. The "Central China Development Corporation" contributed 1 million. The remaining 330,000 was used to plunder the industrial assets of the Shanghai Fish Market, etc., and convert them to pay for it. The company engages in the wholesale market and sales business of aquatic products, as well as the capture of fishing vessels and nets, and the business of refrigeration and transportation.

(11) On July 25th last year, the "Shanghai Fish Market Association" was established with a capital of 100,000 yuan, and the "Central China Aquatic Products Co., Ltd." were two in one, monopolizing the local fish industry.

As for other aspects in Central China that have been controlled, but no agency has yet been established, such as (1) Railways, such as the Shanghai-Nanjing, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Suzhou-Jiaxing, and Jiangnan Railways, are being repaired by engineers dispatched by the Japanese Military Railway Section, the Japanese Railway Department, and the South Manchuria Railway Company, and will be operated by the "Central China Development Corporation." (2) Coal mines, planning to mine the Huainan coal mine, Changxing coal mine, etc., coal is already being transported to Japan. (3) Radio broadcasting, the "Greater Shanghai" and "Greater East Asia" have been established, and they plan to use puppet organizations to control the Shanghai Chinese Chamber of Commerce Radio Station. (4) Tobacco, such as Toyo Tobacco Leaf Company, East Asia Tobacco Company, Gongsheng Tobacco Company, etc., seize Chinese cigarette factories. (5) In terms of agricultural production, agencies have been established in the interior to control purchases, such as cotton. The Association of Japanese Textile Factories in China and the traitorous agency Citizens Association established a control agency in Shanghai, and after receiving a procurement license from the Japanese military, they sent personnel to establish offices in various counties to control purchases and prohibit "private sales." The flower collection offices established by Chinese textile factories in the interior have been forced to withdraw. For example, rice is purchased in Songjiang, Wuxi, Changshu, Suzhou, and other places, and shipped for export, amounting to no less than several million dan. (6) In the shipbuilding industry, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan seizes the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department to repair warships, and occupies the machinery of the Sanbei Hongchang Taixing and other three factories. The Japanese army occupied the Pudong Laogong Mao Dinghai Bridge and the two factories of Da Zhonghua, and Nisshin occupied the five factories of Caili Longchang Hengchang Xiang Hongxiang and China Merchants Inland River Machinery. (7) Cement, textiles, flour, etc., were seized separately by the Japanese side under the instigation of the Japanese army.

4. Connection with Japanese Trading Companies

The subsidiaries mentioned above are the agencies that directly plunder China. They are subordinate to the "Central China Development Corporation," the "national policy company." The "Central China Development Corporation," representing the Japanese government, naturally participates in the organization of each subsidiary, and the rest are jointly organized by Japanese trading companies to plunder the Huili industry and supply its exploitation. These have been mentioned above. For the sake of clarity, a table is made below:

5. Various Industries Plundered

Before the war, there were about 1.38 million spindles and 14,700 looms in the Chinese textile factories in Central China. Currently, about 600,000 spindles and 5,300 looms have been occupied and utilized by the Japanese. There are a total of 37 factories.

Regarding the plundering of cement plants, according to the Shen Bao Commercial News, of the ten Chinese cement plants in the country, only one remains in the hands of the Chinese. The nine in the Japanese-occupied area have all been seized. Among them, there are three in North China, two in South China, and four in Central China.

Central China is a silkworm production area, and the Japanese have long coveted it. In the past, when it was impossible to obtain it, they repeatedly sold inferior silkworm seeds to our country in an attempt to harm it. After August 13th, the silk cocoon producing areas in the Japanese-occupied areas of Central China, such as Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Haining, Deqing, and other places, were all occupied. Since the establishment of the so-called "Central China Silk Company," all of them have been invaded and operated. Among those occupied, there are three factories in Shanghai, with 708 silk reeling machines, nine factories in Wuxi, with 2,554 silk reeling machines, nineteen factories in Suzhou, with 3,656 silk reeling machines, and twenty-two factories in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Haining, with 4,030 silk reeling machines, totaling 10,948 machines in more than 50 factories.

At the same time, the "Central China Silk Company" also occupied cocoon banks and silkworm seed manufacturing plants. There are 214 in the occupied area of Jiangsu Province, including 26 in Wuxian County, 99 in Wuxi, 1 in Changshu, 2 in Wujiang, 1 in Kunshan, 1 in Taicang, 19 in Jiangyin, 20 in Wujin, 8 in Yixing, 3 in Jintan, 10 in Danyang, 10 in Liyang, 1 in Lishui, 1 in Dantu, 1 in Gu Rong, and 5 in Yangzhong and 2 in Jiangna.

After the Chinese flour mills in Central China were occupied and started operation, four factories in Shanghai, such as Fuxin No. 3 Factory, were occupied and operated by the "Japanese Flour Milling Association" jointly run by Mitsui and Mitsubishi. There are five factories in Wuxi: Fuxin, Maoxin, Guangfeng, Guangqin, and Jiufeng. Except for Huafeng, which is operated by the Japanese firm Yoshida, most of them are operated by the "Japanese Flour Milling Association." There is the Yangtze River Flour Mill in Nanjing, which is occupied by the Japanese Sato Koichi.

The cigarette market in the guerrilla areas of Central China is completely controlled by the Japanese. Using military force, it prohibits Chinese cigarette companies and Central Tobacco companies from transporting cigarettes into the interior, and uses tobacco monopolized from Anhui Province, and seizes the Chinese cigarette factories in the occupied area, occupying and starting operations without paying unified taxes. The inferior goods produced in bulk are dumped into the interior, and the market is completely occupied.

There were more than a dozen paper mills in Nanshi, Pudong, Zhabei, Yangshupu, and other places in Shanghai. After the Chinese army withdrew to the west, most of the factories were occupied by the Japanese. Then, the Japanese attempted to lure the authorities of each factory to cooperate with the Japanese and resume operations, but all the factories, based on righteousness, decided to sacrifice themselves and unanimously refused. Seeing that the Japanese were not successful in luring them, they occupied all the factory buildings and machines and prepared to start operations.

In addition, there are other factories that have been seized by the Japanese, which can be seen in the "A Heartbreaking History of Chinese Commerce" in the Commercial News of this newspaper (see this newspaper on December 27th last year), and many factories have sent letters stating that they have not cooperated with the Japanese and that it is definitely a robbery.

6. A Final Thought

I have finished writing this thing after gathering the materials I have now. Of course, we have seen the great national industry suffer from plunder, which is an undeniable loss. We have also seen the other party's future conspiracy within their so-called "Central China Revival Company." We don't need to be terrified. We want to see if they have that ability? And look at the capital of this "Central China Revival Company," nominally 100 million Japanese yen, the first phase only collected 31,382,344 yuan. Except for the Japanese government reluctantly contributing 18,882,344 yuan (cash is only 11,242,344 yuan), the remaining private shares are only 12.5 million yuan, and it took a long period of four months, divided into 100,000 shares, to be raised from 9,770 people. This is a truly and sincerely true fact, which proves that their people are not interested in this. Moreover, the development of many affairs in China is not only useless to their domestic industry, but also suffers from the influence of the reverse. It has already been discovered. Therefore, we must see through this point, and I hope that the authorities of our various industries must earnestly fulfill: (1) Be tough and sacrifice to the end, (2) Never be lured or threatened to cooperate with the Japanese puppets. In this way, let's see what the other party can do, and the industries that you have occupied can also be completely returned to Zhao on the day of final victory.

Of course, we have also seen factory owners who uphold justice and firmly refuse to "cooperate" (I want to mention one here, such as Yan Qingxiang, the owner of Suzhou Dalong Iron Factory and Sulun Yarn Factory. He suffered from Japanese enticement, but he was arrested and threatened, but as a result, he still refused and went to the Southwest. This is a representative.) But we have also seen many who are willing to be used and cooperate with the other party, such as the silk factories in Wuxi, which is an example. (Here, the reporter also gives an example, that is, a famous Nantong yarn factory in the country willingly cooperated with Japan to start operations. It actually hung the sun and the five-color flag on its roof, and supplied the other party with hundreds of thousands of dollars every month. Once, when I went to visit the truth of the factory, a representative of the factory in Shanghai also tacitly admitted it. It is said that the factory was mortgaged to a German businessman, so why not move it? Why should you supply the other party with huge sums of money? The man shook his head and smiled, seemingly expressing: First, the procedures are too difficult, and second, because I still want to make a fortune.)

In addition to the above actions, we must also take active actions, which we hope for the military and political organizations in the guerrilla areas. We must use sabotage work, like the mineral production in Shanxi, to make it impossible to mine. This destructive work does not have to be of any great importance, that is, we must find a way to make it impossible to start work and excavation. If the other party has no ability on the one hand, and cannot use people, and has many difficulties on the other hand, then what can they do if they catch it? (The end)

### Outlook on Japan's Huge Military Budget

Recently, a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo informed us that the Japanese cabinet has already compiled a special military budget for this year, to be submitted to the Diet for review in mid-February. The total military expenditure has already exceeded 725.3 million yen. Superficially, this number seems quite large, but it contains deception and weaknesses. Firstly, this military budget is insufficient for troops stationed in China; secondly, there is no surplus for simultaneous operations against the Soviet Union; and thirdly, it is unimaginable to prepare for confrontation with Britain and the United States by expanding shipbuilding plans. The depression of Japanese militarists is indeed bitter! A brief analysis is given below:

Firstly, let's analyze the expenses of the army in China. The Japanese Ministry of the Army presents its military expenditure in the form of budget and special expenses, amounting to approximately 4.9 billion yuan. From this amount, two aspects of expenses must be deducted: firstly, the funding for the last two or three months of the previous year was not secured and must be drawn from this year's budget; secondly, the Manchurian Incident expenses, previously listed in the regular budget, are now included in the special budget. Even without considering these two points, the total amount is insufficient for the current army operating in central China. The total number of Japanese troops stationed in the central part of China is estimated to be at least one million. According to general estimates, the daily expense per person was 8 jiao during the Sino-Japanese War, 2.4 yuan during the Russo-Japanese War, and 3.6 yuan during the Sino-German War. Now it is approximately five times that of the Sino-German War, about 17.5 yuan. Calculated on this basis, Japan's annual army expenditure should be over 6.38 billion yuan. The surface budget for this year is already short by 1.4 billion yuan, let alone the subsequent needs which will certainly exceed the above listed minimum unit as the battlefield expands! This is the first weakness of Japan's military budget.

Secondly, in this Japanese military budget proposal, it boasts of including expenses for preparing for simultaneous operations against China and the Soviet Union. Its expenditure items include: (1) maintaining the strength of Japanese troops in China; (2) increasing the strength of Japanese troops stationed in the puppet Manchukuo; (3) expanding air force strength; and (4) improving Japan's military supplies. This is an extreme lie, deceiving its parliament, political parties, and the public. The troops fighting in central China are estimated to be at least one million, and the scope of operations is constantly expanding. This fixed number cannot be reduced. Then, the troops needed to cope with the Soviet border must be drawn from within the country, which will increase the number of soldiers "going to war" and, of course, the military expenditure will increase accordingly. How will the Japanese militarists include the military expenditure for preparing for war against the Soviet Union in this year's special budget?

Again, the most vulnerable aspect of Japan's military budget for this year is the naval expenditure budget. The total amount is only 1.85 billion yuan, a very slight increase compared to the 1.72 billion yuan of the previous year; the regular expenditure portion has actually decreased by 27 million yuan. Although there is some increase in contingency and special expenses, it is insufficient to speak of expanding the navy and building new naval bases to compete with Britain and the United States in the Pacific. As Japanese Navy Minister Yonai said, "Britain and the United States are now actively expanding their military forces. If Japan wants to control nearby waters, it must have a large-scale shipbuilding plan." Furthermore, as the booklet previously published by the Japanese Navy Ministry stated, the naval equipment of Britain and the United States in the Pacific will become an overwhelming force and take a surrounding posture against Japan. Then, Japan's mere 1.2 billion yuan budget for contingency and special expenses this year is very far from the so-called shipbuilding plan and the wishful thinking of expanding the navy. We have heard that the Japanese navy, firstly because it is competing with the army for credit, and secondly because it fears the oppression of the British and American navies, is vigorously advocating strengthening the naval base in the Pacific. The first step is to occupy various strongholds on the South China coast, but due to military expenditure and occupation costs, no decision has been made for a long time. Now, seeing the weakness of the Japanese naval military expenditure, the invaders will only be able to sigh at the ocean. The Tokyo correspondent of the German Frankfurter Zeitung commented that Japan's invasion of China is "beyond its reach," which contains deep meaning. Its strength is not only "beyond the reach of the Chinese mainland," but also "beyond the reach" of the coast. The fate of the invaders has become so miserable!

However, the core of Japan's financial crisis still lies in the revenue side. The Japanese people's burden for this huge finance is that increasing taxes has no power, and selling public bonds has no way. The Japanese people's annual income is estimated to be at most 16 billion yuan, and the military expenditure burden alone for this year has taken away nearly half. How miserable their national life will be is not in the eyes of the crazy invaders, but how will these people cope with their finances being on the verge of bankruptcy?

### Fierce Battles in Central Hebei for Days; Jiangnan × Army's Strength Greatly Reduced; We Seize the Opportunity to Recover Various Strongholds

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 9th] Reports indicate that intense guerrilla warfare is occurring in central Hebei. The ×3rd Division recklessly swept through Mancheng, Hejian, and Pingxiang. In Ningjin and Hejian, × We engaged in bloody battles for two days and nights. Currently, with Anping and Raoyang as the center, we are counterattacking towards the Jinpu Railway. The south bank of the Yangtze River × has been transferred, and we have seized the opportunity to recover various strongholds in Jiangnan. On the 6th, we began besieging Guichi. Furthermore, the Nanjing puppet Pacification Department is building seven shallow-water warships in Jiashan to attack our guerrillas.

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 9th] At 10:00 AM on the 7th, approximately ×6-700 escorted grain and ammunition from Anyi to Zhangdian. Our certain battalion ambushed and intercepted them at Cunshang, seizing ammunition. The remaining × troops fled to Zhangdian, and most were forced to retreat to Anyi.

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, Day] On the night of the 3rd, our army harassed the × troops in Dongcheng Village and Zhuanguan Village (west of Lixian County). We encountered × troops near Liang Village and engaged in fierce fighting for two hours. The × troops were unable to resist and retreated to the village. In this battle, over fifty × troops were killed.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Shanghai News. A certain foreign missionary recently came to the lake from Chaozhou. According to him, the Taihu Lake area has become a major guerrilla base, and transportation on the Jinghu and Hanghu lines is under threat. On the day I was in the lake, "Guerrillas and Japanese troops fought fiercely twice in the Nanhu area of the city. As a result, the Japanese troops suffered casualties, seized 16 techniques, 1,200 bullets, and 18 Japanese special agents were captured."

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Shanghai News. The English Continental News reported that in the past three weeks, 300 Chinese guerrillas have crossed the Qiantang River. After Haining, north of Hangzhou, was recaptured by the Chinese army, the situation in Hangzhou is very tense, and the Japanese army is very panicked. They plan to build defenses in the surrounding mountains and lakes. At the same time, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road is in danger of being cut off by guerrillas. Guerrilla warfare is very fierce near Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other cities. Two divisions of the Chinese regular army have also been divided into three columns to attack the Jiaxing area.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 9th] After the Japanese military requested reinforcements for the Japanese troops stationed in China through General Terauchi, the former commander-in-chief of the North China Expeditionary Army, five divisions of troops stationed in Manchuria have been mobilized to the front lines of Shanxi and Suiyuan to "eliminate" the activities of the Chinese guerrillas. Part of these five divisions has arrived at their destination, and another part is on the way. Furthermore, Japan has transferred three divisions from its headquarters to Manchuria to strengthen the troops stationed there.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 9th] According to reports from the Chinese side in Chongqing, the Chinese air force flew to Sanzao Island outside Macau on the 7th to bomb the Japanese, damaging a Japanese aircraft carrier.

### Japanese Industrial Circles Investigate Sales Channels of Foreign Goods, Attempt to Monopolize Our Market

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Tokyo Foreign News. Japanese domestic industrial circles plan to investigate the transportation and sales of foreign goods in the Chinese market in order to rush to produce goods and compete with them.

### Chairman Chiang Encourages the People to Collect Winter Clothing

[Reuters, Chongqing, 5th] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, fearing the severe weather, reiterated his appeal to the people to quickly donate funds to sew winter clothing for the soldiers at the front. It is reported that the recent fundraising has reached one million pieces.

### All Highways in Guangdong Province Will Open to Traffic Soon

[Continental News Agency, Qujiang Express] After Guangdong Province fell into a wartime state, inland transportation was greatly hindered, resulting in local products being unable to be transported out and the needs of various places being unable to be obtained from the outside, thus causing soaring prices and affecting people's lives. In order to facilitate travel and rectify commercial transportation, so that inland industry and commerce can develop mutually, in addition to the direct passenger vehicles on the Shao-Mei Line (from Shaoguan to Meixian) organized by the Highway Department in the middle of last month, but with few cars and many people, it was even more impossible to transport goods. It is specially planned to jointly operate all highways in the province by the government and businesses, and a large number of cars will be dispatched on each main line, so that traffic throughout the province can be unimpeded, and great assistance will also be obtained in political and economic terms. It is reported that this move is already in progress and should be realized soon.

### Our Political Figures Discuss the Current Situation of the War of Resistance

[Reuters, Chongqing, 9th] Chinese political figures here yesterday discussed the current military, political, economic, and social situation of the Chinese government with a Reuters interviewer, solemnly declaring:

Reiterating the Determination to Resist

There can be no direct peace talks between China and Japan. Only a Far East international conference similar to the Second Washington Conference can resolve the current Sino-Japanese conflict. They believe that Japan is very eager to end the current war, but Japan must insist on the conditions of the victor, and China can never accept these conditions. At the same time, Japan will also be unwilling to accept the conditions put forward by China. Therefore, it is expected that Japan will "launch another major offensive, and then prepare to negotiate peace, in order to obtain better peace conditions." × Soldiers are Powerless

In recent weeks, news of battles has been frequently reported in Shaanxi, western Hubei, and southern Guangdong, but there has been no major military development. According to reliable Chinese sources, the Japanese army has secretly withdrawn a large number of troops from the Yangtze River area, and Japanese troops in Hankou, Jiujiang, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places have also been withdrawn. At the same time, it is heard that most of the Japanese troops in South China have also been withdrawn. The Chinese military headquarters recently believes that the Japanese army has no intention of launching a new offensive in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, or Guangxi. The current activities of the Japanese army in China seem to be an attempt to capture Zhengzhou, with the obvious purpose of peering at Tongguan in the west in order to invade Xi'an, Shaanxi. This activity has no military effect, because the future activities of the Japanese will be purely to enhance political influence. However, the impact of this activity on the future is of great concern here.

Impact of the European Situation on the Future

At the same time, it is generally believed that the future of the current war will largely depend on the European situation. If war breaks out in Europe and Britain and France both have a chance of winning, then China will also actively counterattack and strive for final victory on its own. Conversely, if Europe compromises, then international pressure may force both China and Japan to end the war through negotiations. The speaker continued that the development of today's international situation has undermined all the common principles of international trade. Although the London economic community is advocating free trade with China against all opposition, China can only engage in exchange trade with foreign countries, that is, China can only exchange domestic goods for foreign munitions.

General Domestic Situation

Referring to China's economic situation, the spokesperson declared that the results of the current war have not caused any drastic changes. The Chinese people have reduced their economic needs and are supplying them with local products. At the same time, the Sino-Japanese war has not caused any drastic changes in Chinese society. The bourgeoisie and intellectuals are still in power in the government, while the working farmers are still the backbone of the army. The current Soviet aid to China has indeed enhanced the Soviet Union's position, but the intellectuals in power firmly believe that if China wants to establish lasting peace and reconstruction plans, cooperation with Britain and the United States is necessary. According to Reuters reporters, the Communist Party is not yet in a position to confront the Kuomintang in terms of status and power.

### Kunming Charity Sale Raises Over 30,000 Yuan

[Our Newspaper Kunming, 8th Dispatch] The Kunming City business community's charity closed, raising over 30,000 yuan in national currency to contribute to the government's war of resistance.

### Jing Hengyi's Will: Donate Salary and Offer Money

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Chairman Lin recently received a report from Mr. He She, the son of the late Mr. Jing Hengtou, a member of the National Government, stating that in accordance with his father's will, he would donate all the salaries, etc., due but unpaid from September of the 20th year to September of the 27th year, to the government to repay the country. Chairman Lin praised the son for his loyalty and filial piety, and in addition to handing over the donation to the Executive Yuan for transfer to the national treasury, he also reported it to the Central Executive Committee and instructed the Civil Service Office to issue a commendation.

### The Postmaster of Beiping is Still Detained by the × Side

[Central News Agency, Chongqing Day] Beiping News. The Postmaster of Beiping, Mr. Pu Lidi, has not been released since he was kidnapped in Xishan. According to sources in the Post Office, Mr. Pu Lidi is still being detained in Xishan.

### Intense Battles on the Northern Front; Silence South of the River; The Military Commission Announces Last Week's War Situation

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Regarding the war situation this week, the reporter recently met with the spokesperson of the Military Commission, who gave the following statement. In the past week, the war situation on the northern and southern fronts has indeed been trending favorably for us. To mention the most important ones:

Guangdong Province

The situation on the Yuehan and Guangjiu lines has not changed much. The × troops entrenched in the old Sanshui Kan Gang Yang Lao Xia Le Gang Zao Gang area have been continuously attacked fiercely by our army for days, annihilating many × troops. After being defeated, the remaining × troops collapsed and retreated to Sanshui, and each of these areas was officially recovered by us. Furthermore, the × troops in Shengang also launched a fierce joint attack with infantry and artillery on the afternoon of one day. After our brave resistance and repeated hand-to-hand combat, the × troops were almost completely wiped out. Now, we are taking advantage of the victory to encircle and attack the remaining × troops in Shengang. In the sea area around Fangcheng, Qiongya, and Weizhou Island in the south, there are about 30 × warships patrolling back and forth, without any action. However, the × troops have newly transferred two companies of chemical warfare units from Taiwan, carrying 40 tons of poison gas, and will definitely increase their × nature and plot to poison our officers and soldiers.

Central Hubei

After Yuekou and Tianmen were successively recovered by us in two weeks, the × troops from Jingshan and Yingcheng returned to Zao City, and more than 2,000 people launched another fierce attack on Damen. Our army had the remaining prestige of the new victory and was extremely brave. After a fierce battle, the × troops were completely eliminated. The remaining × troops in Jingshan are still under the siege of our army, and the situation has become like a turtle in a jar. They are now rushing to build fortifications in the suburbs, attempting to resist stubbornly. In southern and northern Hubei, the × formations of our troops remain in a stalemate, with no change. Although the × troops intend to hold on desperately to the outer perimeter of Wuhan, under the attack of our army from all directions, it will be difficult to achieve their wishes.

Southern Shanxi

The × troops from various routes have intensified their attacks on us in the past week, but our loyal and brave men have been able to create great battle results with their great spirit of selflessness. After the failure of the × troops in Xinan to attack Zhongtiao Mountain, more than 2,000 × infantry and cavalry from Huoxian, attached with more than ten mountain field guns, again attacked us in three routes. Our army retreated in Youtou at different times. Later, our main force arrived in large numbers and counterattacked bravely, and finally defeated the stubborn × troops, killing 5-600 × troops. The remaining × troops fled northward, and we officially recovered Liaoxian on one day. We are now continuing to counterattack towards Heshun, and the × troops are panicking and intend to flee. In addition, we also had battles with the × troops in Wutai in northern Shanxi and Wenxi, Lingshi, Xiaxian, and Yuxiang in southern Shanxi. The × troops failed to achieve their goals. In the battle of Yuxiang, a certain commander of the × troops was killed by us again, and the morale of the × army has been shaken to the extreme.

Hebei, Shandong, and Henan

The × troops in the three provinces have been vigorously attacking our guerrilla areas north of the Yellow River recently. Our officers and soldiers have been able to match hundreds with one, and their reputation is very strong. We have given the × troops the strongest and fiercest blow. In the Da Zhao area, 500 × troops were annihilated. In the Battle of Qinyang, thousands of × troops were killed, causing the × troops to flee in embarrassment. We fiercely attacked Yangzao Village and other places. The × troops suffered heavy losses and released a large amount of suffocating poisonous gas to help the battle. Our reinforcements divided and flanked them from the north and south. The × troops were greatly weakened, and they are still in a stalemate in the area east of Liwangjia Guanya Bottom, continuing to fight fiercely. The × troops in eastern Shanxi have increased to more than 5,000 and attacked us southward from Heshun in three routes. Because the × troops released a large number of poisonous gas bombs, we temporarily withdrew.

Southern Anhui

The × troops in Huangshan, Yangjiadun, and Jiajiatao in the lower reaches of Dongliu launched an attack on our Chen place some days ago. We bravely met and are still fighting.

Jiangnan

Our × troops and × troops had a small-scale battle at Hexi near Changxing. Our cover position was once lost and then recovered after a counterattack. There is no change in the current formation.

In summary, the war situation this week is relatively intense on the northern fronts, while south of the river there are only sporadic battles. Our entire army and soldiers are determined to kill × and move forward bravely, and have indeed given the × troops a most serious blow to their invasion attempts. It is believed that their any conspiracies and tricks will never be realized.

### × Planes Bomb Nanchang; 23 Bombs Dropped in the Urban Area; Cultural and Religious Institutions Destroyed

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 8th] Two × planes invaded Nanchang at 1:00 PM today and dropped 23 bombs in the urban areas of Yingzhi Street, Minde Road, and other places. The Huaguang Daily News Agency and the Youth Association were destroyed. Furthermore, in Tongxiang, Jinxian, Fengxin, Jing'an, and other counties on the morning of the 8th, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, a × plane was discovered scouting.

### A Comparison of Our and × Military Expenditures Since the War of Resistance; × is Four Times Greater than Ours

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 9th] Local evening newspapers reported that from the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War to January of this year, the Japanese military expenditures have reached 8.8 billion yen, while the Chinese military expenditures have been 2 billion Chinese yuan. When the war began, the price of the Japanese yen was exactly equal to that of the Chinese yuan, so the Chinese military expenditure is approximately equal to one-fourth of the Japanese military expenditure. Such a huge expenditure on the × side will inevitably lead to its collapse in the future.

### The Central Work of the Gansu Provincial Government; Promote Military Service; Step Up the Prohibition of Opium

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 8th] The Gansu Provincial Government now takes military service and opium prohibition as the two major central tasks. Regarding military service, the Gansu Military Region has now been officially established, with Zhu Shaoliang concurrently serving as commander, and two division management areas have been established. The work is currently being stepped up. Regarding opium prohibition, opium cultivation throughout the province was banned last year, and opium smoking is now being banned. The provincial government stipulates that opium addicts under the age of 35 must quit opium smoking by the end of January of this year, and opium cessation centers are set up in each county to complete the total suppression of opium smoking in the province between this year and next year.

### Japan's Delusional Attempt to Co-opt Britain and the United States; Yonai Denies Building a Military Port in South China; Arita's Reply Attempts to Alienate Various Countries

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Yesterday, Wednesday, Japanese Navy Minister Yonai replied at a meeting of the Lower House Committee that the Japanese Navy Department has no plans to build a permanent naval base in or near China, but refused to comment on the question of whether to rapidly occupy Hainan Island.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 8th] Tokyo News. × Foreign Minister Arita made extremely arrogant remarks in response to questions from members of the House of Representatives during the budget debate this afternoon. His main points were: (1) The government does not intend to immediately respond to the notes sent by the governments of Britain, the United States, and France; (2) The governments of Britain, the United States, and France will not take joint action on all issues; (3) Even if the three countries take joint action, the Japanese government does not want to attach importance to it. Arita continued that the Japanese government attaches great importance to the relations between Japan and Britain and Japan and the United States and is studying the issue of no text proposed to the governments of Britain and the United States. The authorities have not yet decided how to reply and when to reply. Regarding rumors that Britain and the United States are taking joint action against Japan, Arita said that since the Sino-Japanese Incident, Britain and the United States have not taken joint action. However, the notes recently submitted to Japan by the two countries have the same wording, and the verbal expressions of the ambassadors of the two countries to the Japanese government also have the same wording. Although the two ambassadors have stated that the two countries will take action after consultation, this cannot be considered a joint action of the two countries. At the same time, according to reports from various newspapers in Paris, France's note to Japan is not intended to be a joint action between France and Britain and the United States. Arita said that Britain and the United States lack common interests in the Far East, so the two countries will not take joint action, and even if the two countries take joint action, Japan does not need to attach importance to it.

[Tokyo, 9th] Foreign news. According to political sources here, well-informed sources declared that Japan currently seems to have no intention of expanding the Anti-Comintern Pact to conclude a military alliance. Although representatives from Germany and Italy have discussed this matter with the government here, the Japanese government has not completely forgotten the idea of ​​reconciling with Britain and the United States. It is said here that if Japan signs a military agreement with Germany and Italy, it will inevitably arouse the animosity of the naval powers of Britain and the United States.

### Admiral Kanji Kato Passes Away

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Tokyo News. Japanese Admiral Kanji Kato passed away at Atami at 2:32 AM on the 9th, at the age of 70.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] Former Chief of Naval Staff and Fleet Commander-in-Chief Admiral Kato died here yesterday, Thursday. Kato was born in 1881 and became famous for opposing the Anglo-American proposal to hold a naval conference in Washington in 1921.

### Chung Shan University Opens Today, Classes Begin on the 1st of Next Month

[Central News Agency, Minming, 8th] The new campus of National Chung Shan University in Zhengjiang is now ready, and it is scheduled to open on February 10th and start classes on March 1st. The Secretary-General of the school, Xiao Guanying, will go to to preside on the 9th.

### Shanghai Textile Industry Conference; Representatives from Factories of Various Countries Participate; Discussing the Issue of Japanese Forcibly Occupying Factories

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Shanghai News. Capitalists of the Chinese textile industry convened a conference of textile industries in Shanghai yesterday and presented a report stating that the Zhentai Textile Factory on the banks of the Suzhou River was forcibly occupied by the Japanese army in Shanghai in December 1937. Later, it was transferred to the management of a certain Japanese yarn factory in Qingdao, and it is still in the hands of the Japanese and has not been returned to the capital side. The chairman of the conference, Gao Mesaer, said that the white side must think that the British authorities cannot guarantee the property of British expatriates, and it is regrettable that the people still do not have the right to use the yarn factory. To date, the Japanese side has not made any specific statement.

### Japanese Newspapers Attack the Shanghai Municipal Council; Using Recent Assassination Incidents as an Excuse; Requesting Interference in the Police Detective System

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 9th] Shanghai Foreign News. Japanese newspapers here have been attacking the Municipal Council, claiming that the recent frequent assassination cases are caused by the Municipal Council's failure to suppress anti-Japanese terrorist activities. The Daily News said that although the Municipal Council has declared that it will suppress anti-Japanese elements, it has not yet arrested all the assassins. If the Municipal Council still "turns a blind eye" to the current situation, then the so-called improvement of the police detective system of the Municipal Council and other suggestions are all mere formalities. However, the Japanese newspapers did not state that half of the assassination cases in the past week occurred in the Japanese-occupied area, and the security problems in that area are usually the responsibility of the police of the puppet Dadao Municipal Government.

[Haitong News Agency, Beiping, 9th] According to a report from Tianjin yesterday, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in North China, Sugiyama, visited the area and abolished the restrictions on foreign concession commerce that had been in place for the past two months. The Japanese side implemented this restriction to prevent the anti-Japanese movement in the concessions from surging.

### Moving Towards the Bozeng Frontline

— Bai Wei

—Eighth Travel Notes from Returning to Huizhou—

On January 9th, amidst a cold wind and light rain, we passed through Luo, spending the night at ×× Temple. ×× Temple is one of the five famous temples of Mount Luofu, with tall pines, slender bamboos, clear waters, and withered lotus flowers, making for excellent scenery. It is now the base of the First Guerrilla Brigade of Guo Jiang. Among the tall pines and clear waters stand soldiers armed with live ammunition, giving the impression that even famous mountains and ancient temples are armed.

The First Guerrilla Brigade is not a regular army. It was originally a training team of the Self-Defense Corps. However, during the period of the fall of Boluo, they gained a great reputation for their bravery and strength in the Xiangshui area, with special battle achievements. They have now been transferred here to take on frontline guard duties. The soldiers of the entire team are genuine farmers, with large arms, handsome physiques, and bronze-colored skin, forming a typical guerrilla force. As their brigade commander, Mr. Chen Shinan, said, although he is not familiar with infantry tactics, he has rich operational experience in guerrilla warfare. When they fire their guns, they don't know how many meters it is. They just treat the × people as a wild boar, using the eyesight and skills of hunting wild boars. Once they fire within range, none fail to fall. Therefore, when the × people hear the sound of the nearby gun, they run away in terror, never daring to return. This is a beautiful tale among the guerrillas.

The deployment of our army on the Bozeng border line is to firmly grasp the East River and the provincial highway, forming an arc-shaped encirclement line from ×× to ××× towards Zengcheng's ×, commanded by Liang Zhu, the deputy commander of the East River Detachment. The command post is located in a small village near ×× Market. Deputy Commander Liang has not yet arrived, and it is currently being handled by Deputy Chief Xie. The next day at noon, the reporter rushed to visit and met Deputy Chief Xie in a quiet village house. We were already old friends, and now, shaking hands after a long absence on the front line of artillery fire, it was even more pleasant and exciting.

After we chatted casually for a moment, Deputy Chief Xie immediately took the reporter and a staff member Tan, carrying a map, and went up to a nearby hill to show the reporter the situation on the front line.

The Bozeng border area is indeed a very favorable guerrilla area. With Lizhi Ao blocked in front, our army occupies high ground, making it easy to attack; while the × people look up from below, making it difficult to advance. Even if the × people were able to pass through Lizhi Ao with the help of a large amount of air cover, the Luofu Mountains provide defense on the side, and they would inevitably be subjected to constant attacks by our guerrillas active in the Luofu Mountains, and be completely annihilated. In fact, every peak of the Luofu Mountains is a natural nest for guerrillas. As we looked at the undulating forests and valleys, as well as the guerrilla fighters, even the reporter couldn't help but...

From the perspective of the entire East River line, the two points of Bozeng and Zenglong (Men) can support each other, directly flanking the back of Zengcheng. Separated from Shilong by the East River, a narrow strip of water, if properly used, can support the actions of Wanshi everywhere. Due to the importance of its position, coordinating with the counter-offensive of Zenglong and Wanshi, our army has repeatedly sloped out of Lizhi Ao to attack Zengcheng. The × people have now withdrawn their sentries to the side of the Duijiang Bridge, and the road to the left of Lizhi Ao has been destroyed and landmines have been laid to prevent the advance of our army. On the eve of our major counter-offensive, it can be seen that the × people are panicked and have few soldiers.

Having reached the front line, every day and every hour you can see low-flying reconnaissance × planes and the rumbling "reassurance cannons" fired by the × people—this is a popular term given to the × people by the soldiers. In order to avoid being discovered as a target, the teams at the front are mostly active in sugarcane fields or pine forests. As we walked along winding country roads, we would admire the faces of the soldiers with thick beards and sharp eyes in many swaying green bushes. Each of them waited with their guns, monitoring the plains at the foot of Mount Luofu. The morale was very high, and they did not relax their positions in the slightest.

The three market towns of Futian, Changning, and Lianhe are all within the border area and have been burned down by the × people during their retreat. The reporter passed through on the way back on the 13th and only saw the remnants of broken walls. Yangwu Mountain, five miles away from Jiaotian, when Boluo fell, the 152nd Division's Zhang Ruigui's troops once supported with two regiments of soldiers and fought with × at this place, with thousands of casualties on both sides. Broken clothes and scattered bones, how much is still left. Now that this vast battlefield has fallen into the hands of our army again, I think the soldiers, if they knew underground, would have no regrets. Recorded on January 30th in Huizhou

### Taiwanese Compatriots in Agony

— Jun Ren

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Before reporting to the readers, I must first explain the source of the news: this was brought back from Taiwan by a friend named Shi. Mr. Shi has lived in Taiwan for a long time, doing business there, passed down through generations. When it came to my friend, Mr. Shi left his homeland and went there. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Mr. Shi initially couldn't bear to give up his business and stayed there. But recently, he encountered sufferings that he could no longer endure. He could no longer bear it, so he resolutely sold the business he was running and fled back to his homeland, arriving in Fuzhou and then Hong Kong. He brought me a lot of news about the suffering that our compatriots, whom we care about deeply, are enduring, and the stirring situation of the revolutionary situation in Taiwan.

My friend said: "Although I have been fortunate enough to escape the tiger's mouth and step into the country, I am still extremely concerned about my compatriots who are suffering the same hardships as me. They are still groaning under the iron heel, eagerly hoping that their compatriots in the country will lend a helping hand to save them from that terrible trap.

"There are still more than 57,000 overseas Chinese residing in Taiwan; their actions are simply completely deprived of freedom, and they have suffered all kinds of hardships. Japanese police officers inspecting the homes of overseas Chinese is as common as a family meal. Some are inspected several times a day, turning over boxes and searching at will. This is the so-called way to "strictly prevent rebellion." When walking on the road, they are also subject to inspection in the same way, at every important transportation route. Overseas Chinese are restless. In order to reduce trouble, many people have changed to wearing Western clothes. Because if you wear a Chinese-style jacket, it is easy to be recognized as a "Chinese" marker, inspected every ten steps, checked every hundred steps, making you unable to cope and dizzy. This is not a big deal, but if you are not careful for a moment, sometimes even some extremely minor things will lead to accusations of "groundless" crimes, which is truly chilling!

"Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the personnel of our country's consulate in Taiwan have also lowered their flags and returned home. In this way, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese are like soulless bodies, with everything gone. The Chinese Association was forced to hang the five-colored puppet flag. The lovely national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth can no longer appear before the eyes of overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese in this situation not only suffer physical pain, but also suffer great mental stimulation.

"Currently, more than 7,000 to 8,000 overseas Chinese in Taiwan are unemployed. They all want to return to their homeland, but because they have no travel expenses, they have no choice but to stay there with heartache. Their experiences, I think, are sympathized with by the people of the country! However, there is one more point to note: even if some overseas Chinese have money to return home (I am one of them), they will be subject to all kinds of exploitation before they can travel. According to the prohibition of the Japanese government in Taiwan, each person is not allowed to take more than one hundred yuan out of the country. If the amount is exceeded, it will be confiscated. Think about it, one hundred yuan is simply a drop in the bucket besides the travel expenses. Therefore, overseas Chinese with a little property, even if they can return to their homeland, will still be empty-handed, with heavy losses. Therefore, overseas Chinese currently residing in Taiwan are in a dilemma, feeling difficult to go or stay."

While saying this, Mr. Shi sighed. It is said that he lost more than 50,000 yuan in Taiwan this time when he returned home. Now that he has returned to the homeland, although everything is gone, he can always hear the true news of the Anti-Japanese War and say a heartfelt remark, which is much better than tens of thousands of overseas Chinese groaning in deep water and fire. Speaking of the recent situation in Taiwan, Mr. Shi also gave us a lot of valuable news. He said:

"Although the situation of overseas Chinese in Taiwan is miserable, the people of Taiwan are even more miserable than us. Since the outbreak of the war, Taiwan has conscripted soldiers many times, and most of the young people have been conscripted to China ××. Therefore, although young people have not disappeared from the streets of Taiwan, it is very rare to encounter one or two. If there are any, they are mostly disabled. Therefore, the scene is extremely desolate. As for the Taiwanese who were driven to China to fight, many were killed or wounded. The wounded were sent back to Taiwan one after another, but the government kept this very secret and rarely let the people know. The wounded were closed in the wounded soldiers' hospital, and were not allowed to go out or to be visited by relatives and friends. Those who gained a little freedom were only a few slightly injured soldiers who were walking on the street with extremely depressed looks. How many wounded soldiers are there in the wounded soldiers' hospital? The number is impossible to know, but it is known that the monthly supply costs a lot, and the people are a little shuddered.

"This huge supply expenditure is all borne by the people through monthly donations, which is a heavy burden. All the metals stored in the Taiwanese folk, such as gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin, have been requisitioned, so gold and silver shops have closed down one after another, and tin shops are also being banned. The number of unemployed workers has increased a lot, and leather shoes are absolutely forbidden to be manufactured. One month before I left Taiwan, a shoe store in Taipei privately manufactured a pair of leather shoes, which was discovered by the Japanese, and the result was a fine of 3,000 yuan. The strictness of the ban can be seen from this. At present, people wearing leather shoes can no longer be seen on the streets of Taiwan. All leather shoes have been issued for military use. Since leather shoes have been banned, clogs are very popular. Even wearing Western clothes, you also drag clogs, which can be said to be a miracle! Gold and silver in Taiwan must be sent to the bank to be exchanged for paper money. No one dares to wear gold rings anymore, but the Japanese government is still afraid that there will be omissions, so it has held a gold and silver registration, announcing notices everywhere, ordering the public to register with the government if they have gold and silver in order to be requisitioned at any time.

"The people's donations are also enforced. Each family is issued a money jar, hung indoors. Everyone must pay a certain amount of money into the jar every day. At the end of the month, government officials are sent to collect the money from each household, and none can be missing. In addition to bearing many exorbitant taxes, they also have to cope with this "forced donation"! The people's wealth is exhausted, and they cannot bear the burden. They are crying out in pain, but the Japanese warlords are deaf to their cries. How can they imagine their plight!

"The people's suffering is getting deeper and deeper, and the thought of resistance is growing. Therefore, the ×× atmosphere in Taiwan is very strong, and the Taiwanese revolutionary party is also very active. At the same time, the Japanese government is also on guard for 'strictly preventing rebellion,' and arrests are made every day on suspicion. However, the ×× situation in Taiwan is still intensifying!"

### Italian Troops Open to Africa France Convenes Important Meeting Britain Decides to Make Every Effort to Promote Peace

[Associated Press, Paris, 9th] The French Senate's Secret National Defense Committee held a meeting yesterday, attended by Prime Minister Daladier, Minister of the Navy Camponchi, and Minister of Shipping Rabo, who reported on the overall situation. The meeting will continue until Friday. This committee is composed of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and National Defense Credit Control Sub-Committee. It has only met once during the Great War. What is noteworthy is that this meeting is never easily convened unless the overall situation is critical, and the fact that it is being held now is clearly related to the tense relations between France and Italy.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 9th] Sources close to the situation claim that French Prime Minister Daladier, at the secret meeting of the National Defense Committee on Tuesday afternoon, declared to the public that General Gamelin, the current Commander-in-Chief and Chief of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, will soon receive special authority and be promoted to Marshal. General Georges will be promoted to Chief of the National Defense Staff to share General Gamelin's labor. According to the French Prime Minister's declaration, there has been no official announcement, as the decision must be approved by the cabinet, but it is expected that this agreement will be implemented soon.

[Central News Agency, London, 8th] British Labor Party members asked the Prime Minister in the House of Commons yesterday what attitude the government has towards convening a world peace conference to remedy the current economic and political situation that is heading towards war. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that Britain is making every effort to promote preparations for convening a world peace conference.

[Reuters, Jiboto, 8th] According to sources here, Italian troops and planes are now concentrating in Jige. Jige is located thirty miles west of British Somaliland and one hundred and twenty-five miles south of French Somaliland.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 9th] It is reported that Italy has transferred a unit of troops to Tripoli and Libya in Africa in recent weeks. The Italian official does not deny this. When British and Italian officials exchange military intelligence next time, the Italian side will report the details to the British side. According to the provisions of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, the two countries originally had the obligation to exchange military intelligence.

[Central News Agency, London, 8th] Well-informed sources recently stated that after Italy dispatched 30,000 troops to its North African colony of Libya a few days ago, it will send another 30,000 troops in the coming days to strengthen its defenses. Those responsible in Britain said that France has a significant military force stationed in North Africa, which is enough to prevent Italy from recklessly invading French Tunisia. Although Italy's repeated increase in troops to Libya is intended to raise the number of troops stationed there to be equal to that of France, the threat to Britain is at least equal to that to France. Therefore, the threat to Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan in the future is the same as the situation when Italy repeatedly increased troops to Libya before the signing of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. Prime Minister Chamberlain just made a declaration in the House of Commons on the 6th of this month, stating that when France encounters a threat, no matter where the threat comes from, Britain will provide France with full assistance. The Italian government is increasing troops to Libya at this time. This is not a coincidence.

[Reuters, London, 8th] During the British House of Commons question time today, Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to Labor MP Mr. Henderson that according to a telegram received from the Italian government, there are about 30,000 to 32,000 Italian troops in Libya. A Labor MP raised a supplementary question, "Is the government aware of reports that Germany recently sent troops to Libya?" The authorities did not answer this question. Sir Sinclair then asked whether the Anglo-Italian Agreement stipulated that Italy would withdraw 1,000 troops from Libya every week, and whether Italy had complied with this. The Prime Minister replied that he still needs to inquire about this issue and could not answer it at the moment.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 8th] The Army authorities recently issued an order to the whole country that reservists born in 1906 and 1907, including Austrian citizens who have not performed military service, should enlist for training from March 28th to May 31st.

### Britain and France Mediate Spanish Peace Italy Makes Another Guarantee to France Volunteers Will Be Withdrawn After the End of the Spanish War

[Central News Agency, London, 8th] The cabinet held a meeting this morning, focusing on the Spanish issue. It is heard that Prime Minister Chamberlain advocated intensifying the ceasefire talks with both sides of the civil war. It is said that the ceasefire conditions proposed by Spanish Prime Minister Negrin include three main points: (1) Volunteer soldiers from all countries within Spain should be withdrawn; (2) The rebel authorities should provide guarantees that no retaliatory measures will be taken against government personnel; (3) The future political system of Spain should be decided by a public referendum or election. It is heard that Franco has accepted the first two items, but firmly rejected the third item. Well-informed sources here said that the ceasefire negotiations may proceed unexpectedly smoothly.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 9th] French non-official ambassador to Burgos, Bilah, returned to Paris yesterday to report on his talks with Spanish rebel government Foreign Minister Chudan and Franco's subordinates.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 8th] Authoritative sources say that the Italian government has made a guarantee to the French government, stating that after the Spanish National Army achieves complete victory and the Spanish War ends, Italy will withdraw its troops from Spain and will not interfere in Spain's internal affairs.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 9th] Poland has given de facto recognition to the Spanish National Army government. It is believed that it will soon be formally recognized. At that time, Poland will send a trade delegation to Burgos to negotiate trade agreements.

British Newspaper Comments on the Spanish War

[Associated Press, London, 8th] The Daily Mail commented on the Spanish war today, "If London and Paris's mediation of the Spanish war can achieve something, countries around the world will be pleased. The Spanish government army can hardly continue to fight. Its only hope is to avoid total collapse and obtain a glorious peace. Franco's control of Spain is about to be completed, because after capturing Barcelona, he can be expected to achieve final victory. General Miaja, the leader of the government army, has shown his courage for a year, and now is the opportunity to show his wisdom. His opinions are highly valued by Prime Minister Negrin. Franco now controls three-quarters of Spain. His government may be recognized by various countries. Spanish President Azaña and his cabinet's trip to France is enough to indicate that they can no longer rule Spain. It is expected that the British and French governments will not consider recognizing the Franco government until foreign troops inside and outside Spain are withdrawn. Yesterday, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini guaranteed that Italian troops would be withdrawn after the Spanish War stopped."

Spanish President and Others Go to Paris

[Central News Agency, Le Boulou, France, 8th] Spanish Republican Government Prime Minister Negrin arrived here, and government army generals have established a temporary headquarters in France. However, the French government previously notified Negrin that Spanish government personnel cannot establish government offices in France. It is not yet known whether the French authorities will allow the Spanish government to do so.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 9th] Spanish President Azaña arrived here from Geneva this morning. Representatives from the French Foreign Ministry and the Spanish Ambassador to France welcomed him at the station. According to reliable sources, Spanish Prime Minister Negrin may resign due to disagreements with President Azaña on continuing the war. This morning, some newspapers advocated that France should immediately recognize Franco's government in order to quickly resolve the Spanish issue.

Rebel Troops Arrive in Grasse

[Reuters, Paris, 8th] Today, the Spanish government army accelerated the withdrawal of troops from Catalonia. These troops are now entering France in the town of Bourg-Madame, and are crossing the border in full force, unlike the previous small teams entering the country. Since 4 pm yesterday, it is estimated that 8,000 soldiers have arrived in Bourg-Madame. All have been disarmed. An entire battalion of officers and soldiers arrived at the border, totaling 600, along with dozens of trucks and 50 mule-drawn carts. The 16th Division, composed entirely of government partisans, arrived in Pusada tonight. It is said that the government army retreated in good order, with tanks in the rear. Almost all the artillery was taken away.

[Reuters, Perpignan, 8th] The border between France and Spain has been strengthened to cope with the influx of refugees. This afternoon, the fortress of Figueras was blown up. The explosion was very powerful, but it is not known whether this was accidental or deliberate. A few days ago, the basement of the fortress was used as an office by the Spanish cabinet and various ministries. The fortress became the target of rebel aircraft bombing. Currently, the rebels are advancing towards Figueras under the resolute resistance of the government army.

[Associated Press, Perpignan, 9th] An Associated Press reporter visited a concentration camp near Amelie-les-Bains today. There is a road connecting the camp with the front line, and refugees are constantly flowing along the road. Men, women, old and young, and the wounded are transported to the concentration camp by horse-drawn carts. Along the way, there are some who are frozen and starving, and who collapse on the roadside. The scene is extremely tragic.

[Central News Agency, Grasse, 8th] After the rebel troops reached this city tonight, the Italian army units that accompanied the rebels to advance towards the French border have been transferred from the front line to the rear.

### US Senator Suggests Limiting Armaments Writes to Secretary of State Hull

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] Indiana Congressman Ludlow wrote to Secretary of State Hull, suggesting drafting a world naval holiday and limiting the expansion of international armaments. Not long ago, Rhode Island Senator William King declared that he intends to ask the Senate to pass a proposal requesting President Roosevelt to sign an international agreement on limiting armaments.

### Britain Urges Opening of the Pearl River Foreign Ministry Answers Questions from Parliamentarians Will Lodge a Serious Protest with Japan

[Reuters, London, 9th] British Foreign Secretary Butler replied in the House of Commons yesterday to a question from Sir Waldron Smithers that the Hong Kong British Chamber of Commerce had asked the British Consul-General in Guangzhou to forward a petition to the British government, asking the government to state its position on Japan's continued blockade of the Pearl River. This petition is under the government's urgent consideration and will soon be replied to by the appropriate authority in Hong Kong. The government is now taking all possible steps to promote the opening of the Pearl River. Opposition MP Mr. Alexander asked whether the government's note to Japan on opening the Pearl River could be expected to achieve more practical results than the note on opening the Yangtze River. Mr. Butler replied that the Japanese side may consider the Pearl River to be a military activity zone, so there must be considerable difficulties. The government will engage in serious negotiations with them as much as possible. Sir Waldron Smithers then asked whether it was not illegal for Japan to blockade the Pearl River if it was at war with China. Mr. Butler replied that we should consider all relevant facts. Regarding the fact that the Japanese side in Shanghai is not allowing the Shanghai Dredging Bureau to dredge the Huangpu River, negotiations are currently underway and some progress has been made. The Foreign Secretary has not heard a report on the blockage of the Huangpu River waterway. Mr. Waldron Smithers then asked whether the government could give the Japanese government some more pressure for the sake of Britain and other countries. The Foreign Secretary replied that the government has solemnly stated this view during the Shanghai negotiations.

### Japanese and Puppet Troops Invade Soviet Border Again; Two Attacks Repelled; Soviet Union Lodges Another Protest with Japan

[Reuters, Moscow, 8th] A public statement issued here recently states that Soviet border guards clashed again with Japanese "Manchukuo" troops on the Erguna River. Fifteen Japanese "Manchukuo" troops were killed and one wounded, while two Soviet guards were killed and two wounded.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 8th] Soviet authorities announced today that Japanese troops attacked Soviet Island No. 227 on the 6th and 7th of this month. The island is located in the Erguna River (one of the sources of the Heilongjiang River, where the Hulun Buir River in Heilongjiang Province turns north and becomes the Erguna River). In the first attack, five Japanese "Manchukuo" troops were killed or wounded. In the second attack, 400 Japanese "Manchukuo" troops first attacked Soviet border guards with machine guns and rifles. The Soviet guards immediately returned fire and repelled the Japanese troops. Ten Japanese troops were killed or wounded, including one officer. On the Soviet side, one was killed and two were wounded. On January 31, there was a clash between Japan and the Soviet Union, resulting in Soviet troops driving the Japanese troops out of Island No. 229. The location of the second incident this month is the same as the location of the January 31 incident. The Soviet government has instructed its chargé d'affaires in Japan to lodge another protest with Japan, stating that the Soviet Union had already lodged a protest last time. The Soviet authorities' statement mentioned the 1911 Sino-Russian Treaty, declaring that the island belongs to Russia.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 9th] Japan has lodged a protest with the Soviet government through its embassy in Moscow, citing the Soviet Union's "unjustified" opposition to Japan's coal mining rights in North Sakhalin as the reason. The coal mining area was transferred by the Soviet Union to Japan's Sakazaki Company in 1925, and then transferred to the North Sakhalin Coal Mining Company in 1937. According to Japan, the Soviet Union had requested the return of the coal mine, but in April of last year, it again expressed its willingness to stop. Japan lodged the above-mentioned protest based on a Soviet newspaper report that the Soviet Union was mining in the area without notifying Japan.

### French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Nageotte, Arrives in Moscow

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 8th] The newly appointed French Ambassador Nageotte has arrived here and has presented a copy of his credentials to the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov.

### Irish Minister of Justice Proposes Bill to Parliament to Ban Extremist Groups

[Reuters, Dublin, 8th] The Irish Minister of Justice, Mr. Ruttledge, today proposed a bill to Parliament to ban extremist groups (such as the Irish Republican Army). The Labour Party leader, Mr. Norton, said that the Labour Party would oppose this bill, and said that the country has been peaceful in recent years as never before. Mr. Ruttledge said that a certain group issued a declaration last December, claiming the power transferred by other groups is not subject to government control, and the government cannot tolerate such provocative actions.

### Dutch Queen to Visit Belgium at the End of May

The flag is blue, with a peacock in the center, surrounded by a gold circle. Burma previously had no national flag; the peacock is its national emblem.

### The German-Japanese Spy Alliance (Continued)

Later, in April, Wutang was ordered to go to France to assist Oshima in advancing the work.

Wutang is a retired naval officer and current director of Showa Steel Works. After he presented a Japanese group’s precious sword to Hitler, he disappeared. In fact, he was holding meetings with German military officers at Krupp!

The visit was quite satisfactory. Soon, a special brigade went to Germany. Most of these members were officers of the intelligence department. In June 1936, the Japanese intelligence department actually moved to Berlin. In Oshima's office, members of the Japanese special mission, representatives of the German intelligence department led by Nikolai, and Dr. Pötschke, the representative of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, met to discuss and decided to divide the world into two areas of espionage activity. The larger area was handled by German espionage, and the smaller area was handled by Japanese espionage.

However, Japan requested that Germany include the Soviet Union in the scope of Japanese espionage activities. After Germany agreed to this request, Colonel Oshima said to Major Walter: "If we bear all the expenses, would you be willing to operate in the United States?"

This sudden proposal made Major Nikolai hesitate. Before 1934, German military advisors in the Soviet Union collected considerable Soviet data, so Germany had a deep understanding of the Soviet military strength. In the United States, Nikolai's file only contained some materials collected during the peace conference during the European War. Germany has always paid little attention to the United States, so apart from a commercial espionage organization dedicated to exploring enterprise secrets, it has never done any work to explore military intelligence.

Later, espionage activities finally expanded to the United States.

In 1937, many German spies infiltrated various parts of the United States and carried out large-scale activities. At the same time, Japan transferred its spies in the United States to China and the East Indies. Therefore, only six major cities, New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Seattle, and San Francisco, still have some Japanese spies operating.

Nikolai led his espionage work in the United States consistently, choosing Pelham Manor as his base and using the Europa as an important tool for transmitting letters, with Major Pfeffer in charge of all activities.

Recently, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested three male and one female suspects, all of whom were indirectly related to the Oshima-Nikolai spy network. They stole materials from the Seversky and Curtiss factories and supplied them to the Japanese side, so they were also subsidized by the Japanese side.

Oshima and Walter always kept the German-Japanese alliance a secret. Very few people knew the inside story. Even the then German Foreign Minister Neurath was unaware of it. But soon after, the Soviet counterintelligence cracked this conspiracy. A branch of the Soviet counterintelligence organization, hosted by the famous spy Yechigan, was active in Paris. There was a Japanese special mission in Burgos. If anyone obtained information about the Soviet Union, they would hand it over to them. Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin received instructions from his country to present this matter to French Foreign Minister Delbos. The French General Staff was shocked and immediately convened a supreme military meeting in Paris. The Soviet military attaché also attended and reported to the conference.

The espionage agencies in Tokyo and Berlin, which had always been secretive, finally had their conspiracy exposed. Oshima, Walter, and others were naturally panicked. But in order to deal with France and the Soviet Union, they did not conceal it, but used a lightning-fast method to publicly expand the organization, saying that it was to deal with the Communist Third International. At the same time, in order to strengthen the strength of this organization, on November 26, 1936, Ambassador Mushanokoji to Germany and German Foreign Minister Neurath formally signed a draft agreement, concealing the true face of the spy alliance.

Behind the Anti-Comintern Pact, the German-Japanese spy alliance continued to exist. Now Japan's general intelligence agency for Europe and the United States is still in Berlin, namely the German intelligence department. At the same time, the German embassy in Japan has also become the general intelligence agency for German military affairs. Germany obtains information here from Doihara in his area, including China, Borneo, Australia, New Zealand, and the Soviet Far East. The Japanese intelligence budget has now increased to 12 million yuan per year, and this huge expenditure is used to pay for Nikolai's leadership in espionage in the United States.

The Japanese embassy in Berlin and the German embassy in Tokyo are less organs of diplomatic activity than exchanges for secret military intelligence! In April 1938, Walter, the creator of this spy alliance, was promoted to German Ambassador to Japan, and Oshima was also promoted to Japanese Ambassador to Germany.

It is rare in modern history for two spy leaders to occupy supreme power in the diplomatic field! (Translated by Min from KEN December issue)

Brief Comment

### World Peace Conference

British Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons the day before yesterday (the 8th) that "Britain is now working hard to promote the convening of a world peace conference, inviting all countries to participate, to resolve all economic and political problems that may cause war." In this land of烽火, will this clear call for peace touch the hearts of the aggressor kings?

Fundamentally, eliminating the爭干戈on the graceful conference table is the sincere wish of peace-loving people in the world, and the League of Nations and all non-war treaties, etc., all focus on this. Unfortunately, since Hitler's extraordinary experience and rise to power, a new world war has actually begun. Coupled with the calamities of the hypocritical, cowardly, and appeasement policies of the peace-loving and democratic countries, the League of Nations cannot effectively perform its duties. All peace agreements, such as the non-war treaty and the Nine-Power Treaty, have been torn to shreds, and international peace conferences outside the League of Nations mechanism, such as the Western non-intervention committees, have indulged fascist aggressors to do evil under the guise of peace and neutrality, resulting in today's Western war catastrophe!

Now, since President Roosevelt issued a statement to aid European democratic countries, the Soviet Union first responded with the fact of severing diplomatic relations with Hungary to打击 aggressors. The British and French authorities also have stronger expressions... Under the further threat of aggressors, the conditions for further unity and resistance of peace-loving and democratic countries are naturally more complete. Is the convening of a world peace conference in Chamberlain's mouth based on these conditions? If so, and if the countries participating in this conference can recognize (1) the Soviet Union as a pillar of world peace and (2) the implementation of a collective security system as a guarantee of world peace, then the convening of the conference and its future are not without hope. As for our China, although we hope that this world peace conference can be convened and complete its mission in the shortest possible time, we believe that such an achievement cannot come from fantasy, but must be promoted by adhering to the national united resistance against Japan.

### The Threat to Humanity

Fascism is not only war, but also a threat to humanity. We can find iron evidence of the three fascist aggressors of Germany, Italy, and Japan crazily bombing, slaughtering, and destroying culture and absolute humanity in Abyssinia, Spain, and especially in various parts of China.

Moreover, fascism is trying to cover up this kind of cultural destruction and inhumane × behavior in many ways, so anyone who exposes this ugly × behavior of fascism from the standpoint of human justice is in danger of suffering extreme persecution. The Reuters Shanghai telegram on the 8th stated that Japan instigated the so-called "Fairness Association" to send threatening letters to American journalist A. T. Steele, etc., and even arrogantly announced the "death penalty" of righteous people such as British journalist Harold Timperley, American journalist Edgar Snow, and Ms. Agnes Smedley. Their ×× intimidation is not worth laughing at, but the threat to humanity can be said to be fully exposed.

Guardians of humanity, comrades-in-arms of justice, will never express surprise in front of this kind of ×× intimidation. No, they will carry out their sacred mission more bravely and more strongly. Although they will suffer shameless sneak attacks, they will receive the support of 450 million Chinese people and the righteous people of the working masses around the world.

### My International Prestige Gets Higher, Rumors Say My Government Borrows 60 Million from Hong Kong Banks

Canton-Hong Kong Western Chamber of Commerce Cables Britain to Protect Interests in China; Resumption of Pearl River Navigation Difficult to Resolve; US Warship Has Stopped Coming to Hong Kong

My country launched a full-scale war of resistance, fighting for world peace and human freedom. Peace-loving people all over the world expressed their warm sympathy and provided assistance. Now, the full-scale war of resistance has entered its second phase. The military and civilians across the country have risen up together and become more united. The international situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, which is more harmonious with me. Previously, my country's consortia went to Britain and the United States to negotiate a loan successfully, and people's hearts became more excited. The final victory is not far away. According to the German-Japanese News yesterday, the Chinese government authorities recently negotiated with foreign banks in Hong Kong and China and succeeded again. The amount borrowed was 60 million Hong Kong dollars, which was borrowed from banks in Hong Kong and China, and was guaranteed by China. The process and success of this loan were the result of negotiations between the Chinese government and banks in Hong Kong.

Western Chamber of Commerce Cables British Government to Protect British Interests in China

Also, since 粤领 Guangzhou, it has implemented a closed-door policy, trying to monopolize the Pearl River navigation rights. It has procrastinated in various ways regarding the issue of resuming navigation on the Pearl River. Recently, the Hong Kong Western Chamber of Commerce and the Shameen Chamber of Commerce jointly telegraphed the London China Association, asking them to pay attention to this issue and strongly demanding that the British government resolve the opening of various rivers in Guangdong and restore British rights in China in the shortest possible time. At the same time, the British Chamber of Commerce in China telegraphed London and demanded that the British authorities take a firm attitude to maintain their rights in China. After the report of the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce arrived in London, the House of Commons paid close attention to it. Hong Kong can expect to receive a reply soon. Sir Qiluo, a member of the House of Commons, questioned the government about this. At that time, Mr. Butler, the secretary of the Foreign Office, replied on behalf of the government, saying that he had informed the consul-general in Guangdong, Bertie, of the situation, and was now awaiting Bertie's reply. The government is continuing to find ways to restore navigation on the Pearl River. Since Guangzhou was occupied by the Japanese army last October, foreign ships have not been allowed to navigate on the Pearl River. Later, Sir Qiluo again questioned the government whether it had considered that the Japanese had not declared war on China and whether they had the right to close the Pearl River. Bertie did not answer, but said that the government had carefully considered this matter.

British Parliament Discusses Resumption of Navigation Between Hong Kong and Guangdong

The Hong Kong Western Chamber of Commerce believes that the lack of access to the waterways of Guangzhou and the indefinite resumption have greatly affected the import of goods and caused deep concern. Recently, it suggested to Mr. Bertie, the British Consul General in Guangdong, that he submit a proposal to the British government, requesting that the × side explain the correct attitude towards the closure of the Pearl River. When the British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Butler, answered the inquiry of Sir Jerome Milnes in the House of Commons Association the other day, he instructed the British Consul in Guangdong to forward the instructions to the Hong Kong Western Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Butler also said that since the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou City last October, the waterways between Hong Kong and Guangdong Province have been blocked. The British government is now considering taking a possible step to seek the resumption of waterways. After Mr. Butler expressed his views, Labour MP Alexander Li asked whether the resumption of navigation this time would be faster than the results of the resumption of navigation on the Yangtze River. Mr. Butler replied that this was because the area was within the scope of Japanese military activities, so there were considerable obstacles, but the authorities were doing their best to negotiate this issue. In addition, the US naval authorities in Guangdong previously held negotiations with the × side in the US warship Mindanao. After some discussions, it was decided that on the 10th of this month (i.e. today, Friday), the × side would grant the convenience of opening the Pearl River, allowing the US warship Mindanao to sail from Guangzhou to Hong Kong. This news has now disappeared, because the × side is concerned that if it allows the US warship to sail this time, the requests of other countries will inevitably continue to be made, so it temporarily cancelled the decision to open the Pearl River lock.

### China Youth Relief Association Organizes Rescue Team to Serve in the Country; Fundraising Play at Ko Shing Theatre Tomorrow

Since its establishment, the Hong Kong China Youth Relief Association has been working hard on fundraising and disaster relief. At this time of national crisis, in order to mobilize the rear, strengthen the front-line war of resistance mechanism, and promote the spirit of overseas Chinese youth serving the motherland, the association members increasingly believe that it is necessary to organize a rescue team to return to the country to serve. Therefore, at the third member meeting on the 29th of last month, all members voted to pass the resolution to organize the first batch of rescue teams to return to the country to serve and depart for the ×× Group Army in Beijiang to participate in front-line work. Regarding the expenses for departure and medicines, the Hong Kong Secretary for Chinese Affairs agreed to raise funds through performances, and the famous Hong Kong gentlemen and businessmen Li Xingqu and Gao Fushen sponsored the association as honorary presidents. The performance date has been set for February 11, 1939 (matinee film, evening drama and others). Matinee at 2:00 PM, evening at 7:30 PM, location at Ko Shing Theatre.

### British Cotton Textiles Exports to Hong Kong Increase

The British Cotton Industry Federation reported that exports of cotton yarn and cotton textiles to Hong Kong and China increased sharply last year, increasing by 8% compared to 1937.

### British China Relief Donation Committee; Executive Committee Discusses Relief Methods; Actively Soliciting Items from All Walks of Life; Hoping to Distribute Advance Tickets

The British China Relief Donation Committee held a general meeting of new executives at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce at 3:30 PM yesterday to discuss all matters related to relief. More than 70 people attended, including Huang Maolin, Hu Suzhen, Lu Lingyun, and Lin Zifeng. Chairman Lei Yinwan announced the reasons for the meeting, saying that the significance of inviting all walks of life to attend today is to discuss the collection of items and fundraising. In order to raise funds for relief, this donation has been scheduled for the 26th, 27th, and 28th of this month for a three-day sale and carnival. We hope that all walks of life will contribute enthusiastically. In the future, if anyone donates to this association, they can send it directly to HSBC Bank to collect the receipt. Then Lu Lingyun gave a speech, saying that the association has been busy with the work of the sale, and the association has pre-sale tickets prepared. Please distribute them automatically everywhere. The most important things for the association now are (1) collecting items, (2) promoting pre-sale tickets. We hope everyone will work hard to promote them.

### National Products Export Collection Point Moved from Hong Kong to Kunming; Concentrated in Kunming and Transferred to Vietnam and Myanmar; Export Value of 70 Million Yuan Last Year

Since adjusting its foreign trade, the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance of my country has been making every effort to encourage local goods to increase production, expand foreign sales markets, and unite with the China Vegetable Oil Company, the Central Credit Bureau, the China Tea Company, etc. to purchase important local goods for export nationwide. They are concentrated in Hong Kong for export. Among them, goods such as silk, tea, tung oil, pigs, wood, and ore are the largest. Those who have settled foreign exchange are allowed to be tax-free. Since the implementation, it has been quite effective. The entire trade has improved, and the import surplus has gradually decreased. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance has increased the fund for the Trade Commission. The total is 80 million. In the past, local goods exports were concentrated in Hong Kong. Since Guangzhou and Wuhan fell, the association has decided to change to concentrate in Kunming. Because Kunming is the only transportation hub in the southwest, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway runs directly from Kunming to Hanoi, and the Yunnan-Myanmar Highway also runs from Kunming to Myanmar. In the future, all kinds of local goods exports will not need to be concentrated in Hong Kong. Last year, the value of local goods exports was 76,264,158 yuan, the year before was 83,815,575 yuan, and in 1936 was 70,574,143 yuan. Last year increased compared to 1936, and decreased compared to 1937, but the export volume of major local goods did not decrease.

### Rampant Bandits on Land and Water: Twenty-Six Robberies Occurred Last Month; One Hundred and Twenty-Four Bandits Armed with Fifty-Six Guns Plundered Valuables and Jewelry Worth Over Six Thousand Dollars

As the year draws to a close, bandits seize the opportunity to commit theft and armed robbery relentlessly. According to police statistics, a total of twenty-six armed robberies occurred last month in various land and water areas of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories. A total of one hundred and twenty-four bandits were involved in the cases, carrying a total of fifty-six firearms, including long and short guns, as well as other weapons such as sharp swords and knives. The stolen cash and jewelry amounted to over six thousand dollars. One of the most serious losses occurred in Sheung Shui Village, where HKD 810 and national currency 1,600 were robbed. The second largest loss was HKD 973 in Shek Kip Mei Village. Among the twenty-six robberies, the largest number of bandits involved in a robbery was eighteen, armed with twelve guns, intercepting Chen Deqing's cargo boat in Nim Wan. Of the hundred-plus bandits, the police only arrested two afterward, and most remained at large. A table listing the robberies that occurred last month is as follows:

### Cantonese Drama Group: The Times Drama Troupe's Seventh Performance, Starting Today for Four Consecutive Days at the Popular Theater

Special report from this newspaper: The "Times Drama Troupe" should not be unfamiliar to those who love drama and care about cultural work. It is a dramatic flower that bloomed in Hong Kong after the prelude to the July 7th Anti-Japanese War. Its core members are generally more alert young people and backbones of the theater community. Its achievements over the past year have left an indelible mark in the Hong Kong theater field.

In their continuous pursuit of progress, they have also been influenced and encouraged by external professional theater troupes – such as China Travel and China Arts – and thus, they are showing a more lively and progressive attitude.

Their first series of work – regular performances – came to an end with the fifth performance. Coincidentally, the famous playwright Ouyang Yuqian came south and agreed to direct the troupe. After this landmark event, the promotion of the Hong Kong spoken drama movement became even more active.

Since December of last year, they have been busy rehearsing under the guidance of Mr. Ouyang. The sixth performance was in Macau. Now, they have decided to perform at the Popular Theater in Kowloon for four consecutive days starting today, as the second phase of their seventh major performance.

The repertoire includes the famous trilogy by Cao Yu, the nation's premier playwright, and the national defense satirical comedy "The New Official Takes Office," a recent work by the famous playwright Chen Baichen. Today's performance is "Wilderness"; the second day's daytime performance is "Wilderness I", and the evening performance is "Sunrise"; the third day and night is "The New Official Takes Office". The fourth night is "Thunderstorm". These scripts are all outstanding works, coupled with their well-practiced skills and the leadership of Mr. Ouyang, success is to be expected.

"Mandarin dramas are not easy to penetrate the general audience in Hong Kong"; if this is the shortcoming of "China Travel" and "China Arts," then the Times Troupe may be able to make up for this deficiency.

It – the Times Drama Troupe – performs in Cantonese, not to passively "please" the audience, but to "adapt" to the environment to improve the audience's level of understanding. The troupe members encourage each other with this, and we also place our earnest hopes on them, wishing them success in completing this difficult task on the cultural desert island.

### Cantonese Merchants in Hong Kong and Macau Store Salt Tax Donations: Ordered to be Used for Refugee Relief; Tax of Sixty Cents Per Load; Total Expected to Reach One Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars

(Special Dispatch) Since the fall of Guangzhou, the number of refugees in Hong Kong and Macau has increased daily. Chinese civil organizations in Hong Kong have competed to provide relief. The Chinese authorities are also sparing no effort in this relief work. It is reported that Cantonese salt merchants in Hong Kong and Macau recently received a notice from Section Chief He Shili of the Guangdong Provincial Salt Bureau's Hong Kong Office, stating that all salt stored in Hong Kong and Macau after the fall of Guangzhou may be transported for sale to the three counties of Zhongshan, Panyu, and Xinhui after paying a salt tax of sixty cents per load in national currency. The tax revenue will be entirely allocated to the Red Cross for refugee relief. It is said that the salt merchants believe that paying taxes to relieve refugees is a righteous act and are very enthusiastic. Therefore, after receiving the notice, they have been paying the required amount one after another. It is estimated that the total amount of salt stored in Hong Kong and Macau after the fall of Guangzhou is no less than 120,000 packages. Calculated at sixty cents per load, the total amount paid by the salt merchants will reach 150,000 yuan. The Red Cross will receive this large sum of money, which will save countless lives, truly a boon for the refugees.

### China's Cotton Exports: Valued at 100 Million Yuan in National Currency Last Year; Japan Purchased 90% to Manufacture Military Supplies; Exports to Hong Kong Valued at Over 380,000 Yuan

According to customs reports, China's cotton exports last year totaled 1,356,620 metric tons, valued at over 100 million yuan in national currency. Among them, exports to Japan were the largest, accounting for 90% of the total, totaling 963,837 metric tons, valued at 71,709,723 yuan. Exports to Hong Kong were 5,009 metric tons, valued at 389,220 yuan. Previously, China's cotton exports were concentrated in Tianjin and Shanghai. Since the fall of these two places, Japan has purchased large quantities from these two places and transported them back for use as industrial and military raw materials, resulting in a sharp increase in national cotton exports last year, occupying the first place among national exports.

### × Purchasing Food in Hong Kong: Imported Rice from Hong Kong Continues to be Transported North; Over 10,000 Bags of Imported Rice Exported in Ten Days

Recently, over 50,000 bags of imported rice stored in Hong Kong have been transported north to Tianjin, Shandong, and other places in batches. According to recent news from rice merchants in Hong Kong, since the large-scale northward transport of rice some time ago, general purchasers have continued to make acquisitions without stopping. Recently, there have been many shipments from Siam and other places. The Hong Kong rice market is expected to decline slightly, but because some people are actively collecting, most of the incoming rice, in addition to supplying the Hong Kong market, is transferred for export. Although the destination is not known in detail, due to the fact that water and land transportation in South China are blocked, the only route is to North China, where Japanese × people are entrenched. It is estimated that over 10,000 bags of imported rice have been exported within ten days. The Hong Kong rice market has not been able to decline in price due to this influence.

### The Hasty Scene of the "Year" End

"Year End" is "Difficult End." Poor people are most afraid of encountering the New Year. However, you may be afraid, but that ruthless "Difficult End" will not let you go. It still relentlessly presses toward you, because that fleeting time has passed second by second. In the blink of an eye, it is already the end of the year!

The not-so-new "New Year" is coming soon. Every year at this time, people are very busy preparing for the "New Year." The wealthy are certainly busy sewing new clothes, buying new shoes, buying new hats, and preparing New Year goods. The whole family, big and small, are extremely busy. However, the lifelong poor are frowning all day long, wondering how to "avoid debt" or "borrow money" in order to break through this "money barrier" that is even more difficult than the "beauty trap"?

The Lunar New Year in Hong Kong is quite lively. The Hong Kong government also seems to accommodate the habits of the residents and specially allows many things that are usually prohibited. For example, residents are allowed to freely set off firecrackers during the New Year period (note that setting off firecrackers should not harm pedestrians or endanger public safety, otherwise it will still be subject to legal sanctions), and a designated location is allocated and leased to New Year goods merchants at low prices so that they can freely sell New Year goods. Because there are Chinese people serving in government agencies, and the Chinese have the custom of holding group worship ceremonies on New Year's Day, special holidays are also granted to avoid spoiling their fun!

Su Hang Street in Central and the area along the Wan Chai waterfront, from Hennessey Road to Gloucester Road to the east, and across the sea, are great places to sell New Year goods every year. As usual, vendors are allowed to set up stalls from the 21st day of the twelfth month. The government also recruits merchants in advance to set up stalls for vendors to rent and use. Although there are no sheds on Su Hang Street, New Year goods merchants will use empty shops that no one rents as their temporary stores. However, the situation this year seems to be somewhat different, because there are not many empty shops this year, and permanent stores have become a problem, let alone temporary ones? If someone rents, of course, it is impossible, and even if no one rents, it has become a problem because the owners take the opportunity to raise the rental value. During this short business period, high rental values are something that small businesses cannot afford. Therefore, the New Year goods market on Su Hang Street this year will probably not be as lively as in previous years. However, the situation in Wan Chai is a bit different. According to the hopes expressed by general New Year goods merchants, the business situation this year may be better than in previous years. The reason is that Hong Kong has tens of thousands more "refugees," who are all "high-level refugees" who have fled to Hong Kong with large sums of money to avoid "disaster," and they are very generous with their lives when it comes to eating, drinking, and having fun. The vendors have this new group of customers, so how can they not be overjoyed and express great hope? It seems that grabbing a handful of money to spend a "prosperous New Year" is not a problem at all.

The sales of New Year goods are already more promising than last year, but the situation regarding the flower market has caused concern among the "flower protectors." Because most of the fresh flowers sold in the New Year flower market are transported from various parts of the country. This year, however, because the homeland is full of flames, Shandong's peonies, Lingnan's plum blossoms, and other famous local products such as hanging bells and daffodils have all been熏染 by the ruthless artillery fire of the × people, which has damaged their delicate floral faces? At the same time, because domestic transportation in the homeland is also being extremely disturbed and blocked by the × people, general flower vendors are afraid of suffering losses and dare not transport flowers as vigorously as in previous years. Therefore, the types of New Year flowers will certainly be greatly reduced compared to previous years, which is undoubtedly true. Although they dare to transport them boldly, they are not worried about not having sales, but they are probably not brave enough because it involves their livelihood. In this case, the flower market this year will inevitably have a feeling of "waning flowers"!

Transportation and Travel

### Memories of Nanjing

— Zhang Ruogu

The first time I stepped into Stone City was in the summer of the 16th year of the Republic of China. Before I went to Nanjing, people told me that Nanjing City was so big, terribly big, several dozen miles around, more than ten miles in diameter. It would take at least two or three hours by rickshaw. Later, when I experienced it myself, it really lived up to its name. The city is divided into inner and outer cities. The outer city is 180 miles around, with 18 gates, but the bases have long been abandoned, and only the names remain. The inner city is about 90 miles around. In those years, there were twelve city gates: Fengrun, Taiping, and Chaoyang in the east; Hongwu, Tongji, and Jinbao in the south; Shuixi and Hanxi in the west; and Shence, Yihui, and Jinchuan in the north, as well as the new Jinchuan Gate opened for the Jiangning train.

Walking out of Xiaguan Station, I took a horse-drawn carriage into that dilapidated turret and the pitch-black Feng Gate. The horse's hooves clip-clopped, and the wheels rattled, traveling on the jagged, uneven gravel road. We had already entered the city, but it was still like driving in the suburbs. From Gulou to Jiming Temple, the road was slightly flatter, and there were fields on both sides. Looking into the distance, I could often see farmers carrying plows, young women carrying baskets, and children herding cattle, coming and going between the fields. I never thought that in this city known as "Powder Capital of the South" and "Royal Atmosphere of Jinling," I could still see such a pastoral scene.

Gulou is the only towering building in the city. Next to the building are open acres piled with artificial mountains, planted with flowers and trees, and covered with grass bricks. The green lawn is like felt, which is quite interesting. To the northwest of the building, there is a pavilion for tourists to rest. The base of the building is a high platform, several feet high, with three arched doors below. The middle door is the largest, and the left and right are slightly smaller. There is a Changguan Pavilion on the platform, with two rear rooms. Climbing the pavilion and looking into the distance, the landscape is like mourning, which can make people open their minds and forget the hustle and bustle.

Turning south from Gulou to Chengbao Street, the houses along the way are lined up one after another, with three or four exquisite small Western-style buildings from time to time. The vermilion tiles and pink walls, with the blue sky, white sun, and red flags flying in the wind among the green trees, complement each other and present a solemn atmosphere in the beautiful scenery. That is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government.

The headquarters of the National Revolutionary Army is located in the West Garden of the former Governor's Office Street. The garden is shaded by trees and has an acre of blue water, surrounded by a tile and brick railing. Duckweed floats on the surface of the water, as dense as a green lawn. There is a stone boat in the middle, inscribed with the words "Do Not Strike the Boat." The boat is slightly smaller than the stone boat in the Summer Palace in Beijing, and the architectural scale is also narrower, but it seems much better than the one in Guyi Garden in Nanxiang. There are also pavilions and pavilions next to the pond, a cluster of clear bamboo, and several stacks of rocks. The cicadas chirp, the birds sing, the flowers are fragrant, and the wind is warm. It is truly a paradise.

In the past, Xihuaguo was a place for personal enjoyment by warlords. At that time, it had been changed to the office of the General Headquarters. Going hundreds of steps forward from the pond, meandering through several winding corridors, there is a vermilion-walled high hall, which is the Central Military and Political Committee. In the past, it was the golden house where the Jiangsu warlords hid their mistresses. There is a square in front of the house, with continuous fragrant grass and lush green shade, still retaining the fragrance of rouge and powder. There is another courtyard behind the house, with a small brick path in the middle, planted with hundreds of dwarf junipers on both sides. Walking leisurely in it, reflecting the clothes into green. At the end of the path, a high hall can be seen, with steps in front. This is the editorial department of the National Revolutionary Army Daily.

The only place to cool off and relax in Nanjing is Xiushan Park, which is located in the southeast of Fucheng Bridge inside Tongji Gate. The park covers an area of more than 40 acres. On the left side of the park, you can see the willows swaying over the Qinhuai River by Fucheng Bridge. On the right side, you can see the clouds on Zijin Mountain from afar. The park originally had the Yingwei Pavilion, which housed the statue of former Jiangsu Governor Li Chun. To the south of the pavilion, there is the Yingwei General Memorial Stele, the Xiushan General Bronze Statue. In the southeast of the park, there is the Xiushan Yibi Pavilion, the History Museum, the Popular Library, etc. When I first visited Xiushan Park in the 16th year of the Republic of China, someone had just proposed to change the park, remove the statue, confiscate the reverse property, and eliminate all the stains in the park. The outside of the Xiushan bronze statue was covered with rice straw, and I could not see its true face. Before long, Xiushan Park was indeed renamed Xuehua Park, and finally it was renamed the First Park.

The most lingering place in the park is "Xiaoyao You," which is the center of the entire park. Most of the tourists are scattered nearby, sitting and sipping tea. There is dense green shade, soft grass, comfortable rattan chairs, and white-clad waiters. The cool evening breeze, mixed with the fragrance of lotuses in the lotus pond, blows in bursts, which can make people's hearts feel intoxicated and comfortable.

Nanjing has many scenic spots and historical sites that make people linger and reluctant to leave, especially the solemn and simple Xiaoling Mausoleum. Facing the deep tomb passage, people can't help but feel a sense of reverence. In addition, there are the lofty Jiming Temple, the elegant Xuanwu Lake, the tranquil Qingliang Temple, and the precipitous Yanziji, etc. This Stone City on Lion Hill once had the great name of "Hero of the Heavenly Palace," but it has suffered many wars and disasters. In the mud of the vicissitudes of life, there are still traces of ancient historical buildings.

Although I am not an archaeologist with a historical obsession, in the ten years after the construction of the new capital, facing the newly emerging Nanjing, I could not help but recall many indelible impressions. Every time I went to Nanjing, every time I saw new buildings, filling this ancient site of the Six Dynasties year after year, the old scenes that I had seen during my first visit became more deeply imprinted in my heart.

Since the ruthless artillery fire of the Lugouqiao incident shocked the dream of the people of the whole country, Shanghai and Nanjing have successively fallen. Before the National Government moved its capital, I ventured to Nanjing amidst the hail of bullets. In the large and small roads and alleys, I found earthbags and basements. The buildings of the various ministries and the traffic on the roads were all covered with gray and black dirt. The entire city seemed to have been blackened by smoke and coal. In the park, there were many wreckage of Japanese aircraft picked up in Nanjing. All public entertainment venues were closed. The Qinhuai River and Xuanwu Lake were also damaged by bombs and turned into a desolate dead water pool. I regretted that during that hurried trip, I did not go to Zhongshan Gate to pay tribute to the tombs of the two national heroes on Zijin Mountain. The heroic souls of Zhu Taizu and Sun Yat-sen are still there. Even now, they are still gazing in the dark at this old capital of Hongwu and the capital of the Republic of China.

### Journey to Northern Fujian (2)

— Recorded by Wang Qixi

Six Bends – Tianyou Rock, Peach Blossom Spring Cave, Golden Rooster Cave.

Seven Bends – Chengyun Peak, Qiyun Peak.

Eight Bends – Jinshi Peak, Lingfeng Peak, Three-Layer Peak, Drum Cliff.

Nine Bends – Cuiyun Peak, Rising Peak, Fishing Peak, Fishing Terrace, Little Nine Bends.

On this day, we first arrived at the First Bend. After passing Zhizhi Nunnery, we arrived at Wuyi Palace, which is the largest Taoist temple in the entire mountain, with many inscriptions. A martyrs' cemetery is currently being built here. We then ascended to Jade Girl Peak, with a pavilion standing in the heart of the stream. At that time, there was a light drizzle, the sound of the stream was clear, and the water flowed in bends. I don't know how many bends there were. Then we went up along the stream, forgetting the distance, and crossed the raft to the other side. We went down the stream and arrived at the public hall at 1:00 PM. We learned that the bus to Jianyang had broken down near Chishi, and a repair shop had been dispatched to repair it.

The public hall is remote and there are no restaurants. Therefore, the bus station manager hosted a meal, which was very kind. We arrived in Jianyang at 5:00 PM. The trip to Wuyi was quite satisfactory.

Day 8 Jianyang to Nanping

In the morning, we packed our luggage and prepared to return south. Mr. Li and others insisted on visiting for a few more days. Mr. Zhao decided to leave today because his vacation was over. We took the public bus. From here to Nanping, it is 118 kilometers, passing through Jianou, a place we have already been to. And the 68 kilometers to Ouping is our new journey this time. The scenery along the way is very beautiful. As we approached Nanping, the highway was built along the mountain, overlooking the long stream like a belt, with many wood rafts piled up beside the stream.

We arrived in Nanping at around 4:00 PM and stayed at the Nanping Reception Center of the Fujian Travel Agency, which is affiliated with the Fujian Construction Department. The facilities are very good and can be called a model hotel. After resting, we went to the city to visit.

The stream in Nanping is called Jianjin. There is Jianjin Middle School here. I jokingly said to Mr. Zhao, "This school must have the style of both Oxford and Cambridge Universities." Then we laughed together. Nanping was originally called Yanping County during the Jin Dynasty. In the past, Zhang Hua ordered Lei Huan to go to Fengcheng to dig a prison house. He entered the ground and obtained a stone with nine inscriptions. There were two swords in the stone, named "Longquan" and "Tai'a." He gave one to Hua and kept the other for himself. Later, Hua was executed and the whereabouts of the sword were lost. After Huan died, his son took the sword and passed through Yanping Jin. The sword suddenly jumped into the water, and only saw two dragons, each several feet long. This is where the name Jianjin comes from. (To be continued)

### Travelogue of Western Hunan

— Farmer

Water and land transportation has become more convenient; the patriotic sentiments of the Miao people are fervent.

[General Notes on Qiancheng] "Outside the Peach Blossom Spring, drifting lightly on a small boat, with residual waters and mountains aimlessly explored, cliffs and peaks lining the banks like Qin Dynasty caves, the entire river bathed in wind and moonlight, like the autumn sky of Chu. Far from my old country, a thousand miles away, I despondently pour a cup of wine in this new pavilion. After getting drunk, I don't mind being as wild as before, reciting verses and gazing at the Wu hook several times." This is a verse composed by this reporter while boating on an autumn night at Peach Blossom Spring. Since leaving Xu last year, I, the reporter, have drifted like a tumbleweed to the west. Grieving the loss of my country and home, and being wanted by a certain faction, my fields and dwellings have been seized, and my family scattered to the ends of the earth. Disappointed in the world, I boldly put down my pen. As far as my whip reached, I dusted off the traces of my journey in western Hunan. It might also be something that those concerned about the southwest would be happy to see.

Western Hunan Transportation - Perilous Mountains and Rivers

The mountains of western Hunan stretch endlessly, with ridges and peaks rising and falling. The Yuan River is long and winding, flowing between them. Western Hunan's transportation relies on this one line. The recently opened Western Hunan Highway also runs parallel to the Yuan River, with the greatest distance between them being less than a hundred *li*. It mostly cuts through mountains to make roads, winding and turning. The driving is laborious. Therefore, the transportation of goods still relies on boats on the Yuan River. This time, my long journey started from Changde, going up the Yuan River. After forty days, I arrived at Lushan. I passed five large rapids and hundreds of small ones, but the distance covered was still less than five hundred *li*. It shows how difficult it is to travel in this area. Going upstream from Luxi, the waterway follows the Yuan River into Guizhou, while the highway branches off at Sanjiaoping. From there, the Western Hunan Highway goes along the Yuan River through Chenxi, Zhijiang, and Xiangtan to Zhenyuan in Guizhou. The Sichuan-Hunan Highway goes northwest from Luxi via Fenghuang and Yongshui to Xiushan in Sichuan Province. In general, the Western Hunan Highway goes southwest, while the Sichuan-Hunan Highway goes northwest. This is a general overview of the transportation in western Hunan.

The Peach Blossom Spring of the Past - Now Filled with Common Hatred

When I set sail from Changde, it was already late autumn. The river was calm and the water stable, making it easy for large and small sailboats to navigate. However, steamships can only travel to below Taoyuan, where they must run aground. Only the section of the Yuan River between Changde and Taoyuan can accommodate steamships in all seasons. Above Taoyuan, navigation is unobstructed in spring and summer. In autumn and winter, the water is shallow and the rapids are exposed. Even sailboats cannot pass without extra towing. During the summer flood season, only steamships can travel, and sailboats disappear again. The most severe flooding occurs around the fifth month of the lunar calendar. Locals predict the water level by observing whether there is spring snow that year. Flooding will occur if spring snow melts rapidly. If there is no spring snow that year, the water will remain stable throughout the year. Experts believe that spring snow melts easily and is difficult to accumulate for long. It flows down from the high mountains, and streams converge to form a powerful current that takes a hundred days to subside. This has been proven true repeatedly. However, winter snow does not have this predictive value. When my boat passed Taoyuan, there was an air raid alarm. Although I disembarked and inspected the county seat, most of the shops were closed. The streets were narrow but clean. Our troops were stationed there, and the defenses were well-established. The Social Education Corps was also adjusting its work among the people. According to Mr. Bie of the Education Team, although Taoyuan is known as a secluded place, it is close to Changde and has convenient transportation, far surpassing the upper reaches. The morale of the people is highly developed. The county seat is on the north bank of the Yuan River, and the Western Hunan Highway runs west along the south bank. The Qin Dynasty caves that have always been praised are also in the mountains on the south bank, about thirty *li* from the city. Because the boat trip was long, I was unable to visit. It was once known as a place to escape the world, but now it is filled with common hatred, which is enough to make people happy. The Qin Dynasty is not worth escaping from anymore.

Many Rapids on the Yuan River - Cliffs on Both Banks

After passing Taoyuan, the boat gradually entered the rapids. The section of the upper Yuan River between Yuanling and Taoyuan, a distance of three hundred *li*, has the most rapids. The large rapids are all within Yuanling. Going upstream along the river, the first is Wengzidong, then Qinglangtan, then Niangniangtan, then Hengshitan, and then Jiuxitan. Among the five large rapids, Qinglang is the most dangerous, five *li* long. On the shore is the Shrine of the Marquis of Xinxi, also known as the Fubo Palace, which houses a statue of General Ma Yuan of the Han Dynasty, the Fubo General. The incense is very strong. Merchants sailing to and from this place must drop anchor here and offer a prayer. The local people offer sacrifices even more devoutly, commonly calling it the Lord's Temple. The upper reaches of the Yuan River were the ancient land of the Five Creek Barbarians. Fubo pacified the barbarians, going upstream along the river. Qinglangtan was where his troops were stationed. The rapids have many whetstones, and the water is constricted by the stones, making the channel narrow and the flow rapid. When boats pass through here, they must temporarily add trackers. Ropes are carried ashore, and trackers pull the boats upstream. The narrowest part of the channel can only accommodate one boat. When I arrived here, the masts of the boats were like a forest, waiting to pass through the rapids in order between the rapids exit and Dongting Creek, a distance of five *li*. Because my boat was light and small, I was able to pass through easily without delay. I heard that some boats had been waiting for half a month and still had not set sail. The dredging of the rapids is urgently needed. The waterway in the lower reaches of Wengzidong is also narrow, but because the rapids are short, it is easier to pass through. The rapids upstream, such as Luoniang, Fushi, and Jiuxi, have rapid water and wide channels, so there is no need to stop. However, all the rapids have cliffs on both banks, making the waterways narrow and steep. The banks of Wengzidong are particularly steep, with iron chains fastened to the rocks for climbing. During the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, the prefect of Chenzhou repaired the existing three hundred plus *zhang*, but it is now dilapidated and incomplete. Trackers carry ropes ashore, grasp the chains to prevent capsizing, and crawl along the path. This is their profession. Each tow earns them three or four *jiao*, and the helmsman earns twice as much. The old rule for towing in the rapids was one bowl of rice per tow. The Hengshitan waterway is wide, so water towing is required. The trackers carry ropes and wade through the water, which can be deep enough to reach their thighs. This is often the case even in the cold winter. They are truly accustomed to it.

Dense Population Around Yuanling

Yuanling was the seat of the Chenzhou Prefecture during the Qing Dynasty. The city is on the north bank, built against the mountain, with a majestic appearance. Now the Hunan provincial government has moved here. The south bank is the bus station, with a dense population. It is the most important town in western Hunan. Society and culture are highly developed. There used to be two newspapers, "Yuantao" and "Chenzhong". Recently, "Zhongbao" and "Guomin Daily", which was moved from Changsha, have been added. The circulation is wide. All the news of western Hunan is channeled through here. According to Mr. Cai of the Social Education Corps, the local people are very enlightened, and the education is very smooth. National consciousness is very strong. Donations are enthusiastically made to relieve the national crisis. Above this, to Luxi, there are mixed Miao people who are known to be difficult to govern, because of their strong customs. However, they are rich in traditional ideas. Mr. Chen Quzhen, the author of "Travels in Western Hunan", is highly respected by the Miao people. Now, Chen has moved the Western Hunan Pacification Office to Qiancheng, which makes it even more convenient to govern the Miao people. The once mysterious region of western Hunan, in the eyes of the people of the country, is being thoroughly developed. As for the waterway, after passing Yuanling, it becomes more calm again. The boat travels for one day to Shanghai. Luxi is a tributary of the Yuan River. The county seat is prosperous. Boats coming from upstream all moor here. Because of my mission, I changed to a car to go to Qiancheng. It took three hours to arrive. The car travels on mountain slopes, overlooking the creek. This is the Sichuan-Hunan Highway. Compared to the Western Hunan Highway from Sanjiaoping, it is still flat. Only small boats can be rowed on the waterway. The Sichuan-Hunan transportation relies on this highway.

Living Conditions of the Miao People in Western Hunan

Qiancheng was the seat of Qianzhou Prefecture during the late Qing Dynasty. It is surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the city is built of stone, small and solid. The highway is fifteen *li* east of the city, with a branch connecting to the county seat. Miao people from all directions gather and live together. Within about ten *li*, they are all acculturated Miao. Beyond thirty *li*, one sees the raw Miao. The acculturated Miao people, both men and women, wrap their heads in blue cloth and wear straw sandals. The clothing of the men is no different from that of the Han people. The women still wear Qing Dynasty-style clothing, and they like to wear silver ornaments, with chains and locks hanging down their chests. They can speak Mandarin when they go to the market to buy things. The raw Miao people live in the mountains and rarely go to the market. Both acculturated and raw Miao people like to eat duck blood. Bowls of blood are displayed in the shops, and the Miao people drink them freely. Both men and women are strong and can climb mountains like flying. They use copper coins from Sichuan Province. Recently, the Pacification Office announced that legal tender will be used uniformly. The local community fully supports the legal tender policy, and the credit is obvious. Legal tender is now circulating among the Miao people. The Miao people's anti-Japanese sentiment is also very high, thanks to Mr. Chen's orders. The primary and secondary school teacher service group is working effectively in the social education work in Qiancheng. This year, during the New Year, Zhang Zhizhong inspected western Hunan and was warmly welcomed by all sectors in Qiancheng. In the evening, the local people held a torchlight parade, fully expressing the patriotic spirit of the people. This is truly gratifying to the people of the country. After this, I will go deeper into the Miao region and have more to tell readers.

### A Conspiracy to Destroy Our Silk Industry

— Wu Ma

Because in this way, the vicious Japanese will use valuation methods to take over your silkworm rearing rooms, silkworm rearing tools, mulberry gardens, etc., as fixed assets. Wouldn't that fall right into their trap? Therefore, for the current plan, silkworm rearing farms and manufacturing centers in the war zone should actively adopt two routes: moving to the guerrilla zone and the rear. The former is to move as much as possible and as quickly as possible everything that can be moved to the area controlled by the guerrillas, in order to prepare for starting the silkworm rearing business in the guerrilla zone. At the same time, everything that cannot be moved, such as the buildings near the silkworm rearing rooms, should be completely or partially destroyed in order to cut off the Japanese's covetous desires. We know that in the war zone, the Japanese only maintain a few transportation lines with difficulty, as well as the larger cities. Other vast rural areas are under the control of the Chinese guerrillas. Therefore, as long as the silkworm rearing farms are willing to give up the current equipment, there is no problem in moving to the guerrilla zone to operate. Moreover, the silkworm eggs from several silkworm rearing farms that are deeply trusted by the farmers, such as the Tiger Brand silkworm eggs from the Huxuguan Dayou Silkworm Rearing Farm, the Longevity Star Brand silkworm eggs from the Huguan Silkworm Rearing Farm, the Triangle Brand silkworm eggs from the Renxu Hall, and the Three Gourd Brand silkworm eggs from the Taixi Sanwu Hall, can still maintain their inherent position among the farmers in the war zone and will not be destroyed. Then, after driving away the Japanese in the future, it will be an excellent foundation for expansion. (To be continued)

### Singapore Chinese Football Team Arrives in the Philippines First and then Hong Kong, Squad Set to Depart on March 13

[Special Report] The Chinese football scene in Singapore has made considerable progress in recent years. The Chinese football team, which is most popular among fans there, swept everything this season and won the league title.

The team is not satisfied with winning the championship and has decided to travel to the Philippines for matches in the near future to improve the players' skills. They will also come to Hong Kong afterwards. This has been reported before.

A month ago, the team's vice-captain, Xu Houkun, came to Hong Kong to discuss the trip with the South China Athletic Association. The team's initial plan was to come to Hong Kong first and then move to the Philippines, but the Philippine side did not approve of this, fearing that if the team played in Hong Kong first, any injuries to the players would affect the box office appeal in the Philippines.

The team respected the host's wishes and decided to go to the Philippines first, arriving in Hong Kong at the end of March. They will play two matches in Hong Kong. South China has reported this to the General Association and received its approval. The final of the Li Hua Cup will be moved forward to March 26, and the dates of April 1 and 2 will be used for the team's matches against South China and the Hong Kong Combined Team.

I received a letter from the team's vice-captain, Xu, yesterday, saying that the team's squad for this trip is quite balanced. However, it is a pity that Zheng Liliang, a former South China player who is now playing on the left wing in Singapore and often puts on outstanding performances, will not be able to join the team due to business reasons. However, his replacement, Yan Jixiang, is also a good left winger. They also plan to invite Huang Jinbo, a goalkeeper from Kuala Lumpur, and Guan Shunde, a talented forward, to join the team to increase their fighting power. All the team members are now applying for leave and should be able to travel in full force. The departure date has been set for March 13, when they will take the Italian mail ship Victoria to the Philippines, and they will arrive in Hong Kong from the Philippines on March 26. The full team roster is as follows (Soccer Overlord):

Singapore Chinese Team

Li Botang Huang Jinbo

Ye Maofa Wen Shunshan Deng Yuehan (Captain)

Sun Chunlai Xu Houkun (Vice-Captain) Zhu Chenggui Ji Youling

Yan Jixiang Guan Shunzong Yuan Xiang He Guocun Xie Jinfu Xia Zhixiang Wu Zhan

### Interport Team Tests Their Skills, Drawing with Hong Kong Combined Team

[Special Report] Yesterday at 5:00 PM, the Hong Kong Interport Representative Team played a practice match against the Hong Kong Combined Team at the Navy Ground. The Interport Team fielded their original lineup, while the Hong Kong Combined Team was missing Wu Liezhi, Liao Yachen, Zuo Zhi from Kowloon Football Club and Bi Ledu from St. Joseph's College. The lineup was slightly changed.

The reason why Wu Liezhi, Liao Yachen, and Zuo Zhi were absent was not because they were busy, but because they did not want to exert themselves and were preparing to play against South China tomorrow to fight for the semi-final spot in the Beryl Cup.

Tickets were two jiao each, a reasonable price, so the spectators were very crowded, with a total of over five thousand people.

Because it was a practice match, the Interport Team players did not put on a very energetic performance, which was expected. To prepare for the big battle to come, they naturally did not want to compete too intensely in this practice match or cause any injuries to their bodies, which would affect the important event.

In my opinion, the Interport Team had many flaws in yesterday's match that need to be addressed and improved.

(1) The three midfielders, as I expected, all liked to dribble and attack, so the Hong Kong Combined Team's forwards were able to find winning opportunities and had more overall shots than the Interport Team. This was because the three midfielders of the Interport Team liked to attack, often leaving the defense empty. The Hong Kong Combined Team's forwards were able to take advantage of this and launch surprise attacks. This type of attack does not seem like a good strategy for dealing with the Philippine team, because the Philippine team players are all strong and agile. Surprise attacks are their specialty. I think the three midfielders of the Hong Kong team should improve this attack strategy.

(2) The five forwards were not coordinated. Li Huitang was originally a master of center attacks, but Shi Dagao seemed unable to cooperate with him, passing more often to the left wing than passing to the center. Therefore, the only one who could fully support Li Huitang was Feng Jingxiang, but Fula was not coordinated with Jingxiang, and his crosses were not accurate. Hou Chengtou was energetic enough, but his dribbling was not yet adequate. Chengtou should pay attention to this.

(3) As for the inside backs, Li Tiansheng was beyond reproach, but Shi Han's position often failed to cover Liang Rongzhao, so their cooperation in mutually caring for each other was lacking in understanding.

I believe that the Hong Kong team representatives should start practicing every morning from now on and try to improve the team's offensive and defensive cooperation. Then it will be easier to achieve success in the big battle to come.

On the Hong Kong Combined Team, Hou Rongsheng, Deng Guangsen, and MacAllister performed the best. Chen Dehui was also a likable player. If the Hong Kong Combined Team had fielded their original lineup, the Interport Team would have been threatened. In the first half, the two teams tied 0-0. In the second half, seven minutes after the start, Huitang's long shot hit the crossbar and bounced to the ground. Chengtou rushed forward and headed the ball in, opening the scoring. A moment later, Dehui received a pass from Deqi and scored in front of the goal, making it 1-1. The score remained the same until the end of the game. The rosters of the two teams are as follows:

(Dong Lang)

(Interport Team)

Tan Junkun

Shi Han Li Tiansheng

Liang Rongzhao Hou Chengtou Dagao Shinu Dickson Li Huitang Han Luweini Feng Jingxiang Bi La

(Hong Kong Combined Team)

### Shanghai Charity Basketball Final; Mixed Team Wins Championship; Chen Bangzhen's Two Long-Range Shots Bring Resurrection; 30-34 Macleans Lose

[Shanghai, 5th Dispatch] The China Youth Basketball Arena was filled with cheers last night, and the atmosphere was frenzied. Enthusiastic ladies packed the venue. In the final match of the East-West Charity Basketball Tournament organized by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Chinese Mixed Team, in the last two minutes when all hope seemed lost, trailing Macleans 28-30, Chen Bangzhen, as a new force, jumped onto the court and made two long-range shots from the half-court line, one directly in the center and one on the right side. Miraculously, both shots went in, resurrecting the Mixed Team and putting them ahead of Macleans with a score of 32-30. Just before the end, Da Yun scored again, resulting in the Mixed Team defeating Macleans 34-30 and winning the championship. The overall record was two wins to one. In the first game, the Mixed Team defeated Macleans 28-20. In the second game, Macleans defeated the Mixed Team 28-25. In the third game, the Mixed Team defeated Macleans 34-30.

Mixed Team Escapes Dangerously

The Mixed Team's overall performance last night was extremely poor, almost entirely controlled by Macleans. Initially, they trailed 7-4, then rallied, taking the lead by one point only twice, at 10-9 and 11-. However, the first half ended with Macleans leading by one point at 12-11. In the second half, Macleans came on strong, scoring three consecutive goals to make it 18-11. From then on, they led the way, with the Mixed Team trailing, falling behind 27-19, a significant deficit of eight points. Everyone was sweating for the Mixed Team. Chen Xianglong was ejected in the first half, and then Li Zhenzhong was also ejected. However, the Mixed Team ultimately turned defeat into victory in desperation, which was truly fortunate and incredibly close. Macleans performed impressively last night. In the first half, they used a five-man zone defense, focusing more on attack than defense. The Mixed Team had four defensive lapses, but fortunately, Macleans' shots were inaccurate, and they failed to capitalize, missing countless opportunities under the basket, which was one of the reasons for their loss. Furthermore, Bliss was ejected first, and then their key player, Passcott, was also ejected, which led to their decline. Otherwise, Chen Bangzhen's two shots might not have had the chance to make a difference. Li Zhenzhong of the Mixed Team performed exceptionally well last night, scoring a game-high thirteen points. He scored four times in the second half, saving the overall situation, and his contribution cannot be overlooked. There were a total of twenty-seven fouls last night, with four players ejected, which demonstrates the intensity of the competition.

Macleans Attacks Fiercely

The referees were Qu Honglu and Bo Latuo. The Mixed Team initially fielded Er Chen (Xianglong Xuechong), Cai, Li, Sun, and Tian Bai, while Macleans countered with Liang Pai Wang and Bliss Hall. Xuechong scored under the basket to open the scoring. Wang Erde fouled, and Da Mao scored the free throw. Bliss quickly followed with a goal, and Zhenzhong immediately scored back a point, making it 4-2. Xianglong penetrated, and Bliss scored a free throw, while Sechin Du scored two consecutive goals, putting them ahead 7-4. Zhenzhong attempted a shot, and the ball went through the net. Bliss and Xuechong each scored a free throw. Macleans called a timeout. Qiao Maitaijiermuer replaced Wang Erde, and Paierya. The Mixed Team also replaced Li Zhenzhong with Zhou Da Yun. Cai and Bliss each scored a point. Xianglong scored, putting them back in the lead at 10-9. At this time, Macleans attacked fiercely but failed, missing consecutive shots. Xianglong committed his fourth foul and was forced to leave the court, which allowed Bliss to tie the score. Zhenzhong then scored one point, and Mai Taijie also scored a goal, ending the first half with Macleans 12 and the Mixed Team 11.

Chen Bangzhen Resurrects

Continuing the battle, Macleans' momentum intensified. Bliss scored, and Pielman scored two free throws in one go, adding six points. Li Zhenzhong's wonderful shot was effective, gaining two goals. Macleans had a poor start, calling a quick timeout, and indeed regained four points. Xuechong and Bliss each showed their skills, making it 24-17. The Mixed Team then replaced Zhou Yunda Yun with Shen Yugong. Then Macleans took the lead with 27-19. Zhenzhong Xuechong, both shooting and free throws, become Gan four to twenty-seven. Bliss committed his fourth foul and was ejected. Muer joined the battle. After Zhenzhong scored a goal, he also went off the field and award the last victory with four fouls. Transferring Da Yun to the battlefield, Passcott made one of the two free throws, Bliss also had four fouls, and Mai Taijie entered the field and immediately scored. The Mixed Team rushed to replace Li Zude, who had not been on the field for long, with Chen Bangzhen. Da Yun turned it into 28 to the state, which was still two points behind, and everyone was worried. The time was approaching. Unexpectedly, Bangzhen's half-court long shot leveled the score to 30. Then Bangzhen again used old tricks to secure the victory, until Da Yun threw the last ball and cheers followed. The mixed unit then thirty-four to thirty-one

### Film and Drama

Entertainment... Lover in a Dream

The Shopworn Angel

The film depicts two young men and women who are swept up in different destinies. One is a truly sincere farm boy who is sent to the front lines of a merciless war. The other is a gold-digging showgirl whose soul is scarred and whose fate is precarious. They both seek satisfaction in "dreams" amidst a terrible reality, and dream-like "love" gives them much encouragement and comfort.

Margaret Sullavan plays a worldly-wise gold-digging showgirl in the film. She sacrifices the flattery of another wealthy man and, under special circumstances, accepts the love of another sincere young man who has already enlisted. Although she fully understands that the love between herself, who is accustomed to extravagance and debauchery, and this simple young man is absolutely impossible, she does so to fulfill the young man's dream, and marries him the moment before he leaves.

The film vividly and realistically depicts the mobilization situation in the United States when it participated in the European War, and the social dynamics full of tense war atmosphere. Margaret Sullavan's excellent performance in "Three Comrades" left us with an indelible impression. In this film, she also has a very satisfactory performance due to the suitability of her character. James Stewart's acting skills in the film are as excellent and moving as in "Seventh Heaven." Walter Pidgeon can also be praised.

The film depicts a loving female clerk who pursues the man she dreams of, but unfortunately, that man is somewhat foolish. Apart from being obsessed with a career at sea, nothing else is worth his attention, and women are of course no exception. Even the tender and beautiful female clerk's flattery is not appreciated by him at all. In the end, he even resolutely wants to avoid her entanglement, but the pain of seasickness breaks his dream of sailing and heals his ruthless problem.

Although the film does try to enrich its content with various scenes, such as fashion shows and public swimming pools, it still fails to completely conceal the shortcomings of the film's empty content. In terms of actors, Ann Blyth still has a charming performance. As for Zachery Scott, who plays the young man obsessed with sailing, although his performance of the character is a bit exaggerated, he is the center of interest in the film from beginning to end.

Oriental...Golden Heart Twists the Tongue

You're a Sweetheart

Produced by the New Universal Company, it features two singing stars, George Murphy and Alice Faye, several comedic stars, the old prankster Charles Winninger, and the silly Andy Devine. There are plenty of laughs, and the songs are also very pleasant to listen to.

Dahua...Three Sisters

Sally, Irene and Mary

Alice Faye, Joan Davis, and Marjorie Weaver are close friends like three sisters here. Because of the economic downturn, they have worked as manicurists and cigarette girls in dance halls. Therefore, they met the singing star Tommy - Tony Martin - and Sally - Alice Faye - fell in love with him at first sight. Later, after many twists and turns, they got a dilapidated yacht. In order to renovate it into a floating nightclub, a large sum of money is needed. Sally and Tony are determined to make a deal: they are willing to marry two wealthy men who love them, as long as they can come up with the money. On the opening day of the floating nightclub, as if by Heaven's grace, the two male and female patrons who paid for it fell in love with each other. Everyone was delighted. Sally and Tony immediately got married, and even Jamie Duran, who worked as a cleaner, and Irene - Joan Davis - were inseparable and overjoyed.

The story is obviously a comedy. Jamie Duran and Joan Davis are the center of laughter. Phyllis Kennedy and Frank Albertson are also cold and interesting.

New World Continued Seven Fresh Roses

Cantonese film

The previous episode, "Seven Fresh Roses," ended with Ma Loufen marrying Lin Meimei. This episode begins with Lin giving birth to a child, followed by Ma and Lin's deteriorating relationship. At the same time, it recounts how Feng Feng and Xu Manli also experienced conflict after their marriage due to their poor relationship, leading to extreme outcomes. It then describes how Ma Loufen unexpectedly meets Xu Manli, and the two fall in love. The old couple discovers this, revealing that Ma and Xu were originally engaged. As a result, both sides realize their mistakes. Ma History disappears from society, and is eventually moved by his son and returns home, reconciling with Lin.

In order to cater to low-level audiences, the plot is forced and unbelievable, and the acting is also lackluster. The old-fashioned approach makes the audience dislike it.

Central...Hu Huigan Fights the Machine Room

Cantonese film

Due to the excellent box office success of "Fang Shiyu Fights on the Stage," smart producers seized the business opportunity. This film is a product of that motivation.

Hu Xiqian is weak and incompetent, and is bullied by people in the machine room. His father was killed, and they even want to take his wife and younger sister. Forced by the circumstances, Hu Huigan decides to run the machine room and go to Shaolin Temple to learn martial arts so that he can avenge his father in the future. After many hardships and dangers, he happily returns one day and finally avenges his father. The plot of this film is that simple. The director has no skills to speak of. Li Shanxiao changes his style to play Hu Huigan, and his performance is acceptable. Xu Renxin has been away from the screen for a long time, and makes a comeback in this film, with a good performance. The set design is too simple, and several fight scenes lack tension.

Lee Theatre High Sheng Co-screening...Hua Mulan

Cantonese film

The plot depicts a modern woman who wants to be a modern "Hua Mulan" because she once played "Hua Mulan" on stage. Sure enough, when the country is in serious trouble, she realizes her ambition. The reason is that she discovered a well-organized traitorous organization, so she and her lover, Jie Shanxiao, jointly try to crack the secret agency and steal documents. After unknown difficulties, they finally achieved their goal, and even the clever and foolish traitors were moved by their great spirit and jointly set off to the front line.

We do not deny that this plot is one of the better ones in South China, but it is still quite far-fetched. The director cannot use the techniques of cinema. Zheng Shanxiao and Chen Yunshang act well.

Taiping...The Story of the Heroic Sons and Daughters

National film

Because it does not have the unreasonable elements of supernatural films, this film from Xinhua Company is not too bad, although it cannot be said to have any particularly good achievements. Many places in the play that should be tense are passed over plainly. Gu Lanjun - the female star who has become popular after the war - performs well.

### Literary Resistance and Collective Creation

— Yun Jie

In the creative practice of literary resistance, we need to especially emphasize collective creation, this new type of progressive method, because it is humanity's newest and most advanced tool for artistically understanding and expressing the world, the most powerful method. Only by applying this new and powerful method, through the collective process of understanding and expression, can we most precisely, accurately, and vividly reflect the urgent and turbulent reality of resistance currently facing China, revealing the intricacies, twists, turns, and developments of the reality of China's resistance, as well as the essence and future of these changes and developments. The most basic task of literary resistance lies in faithfully and accurately reflecting the current state of resistance. Therefore, collective creation, as the method that is best at understanding and expressing objective truth, and most capable of unearthing and reflecting the truth of reality, becomes a creative mode that should be particularly emphasized and focused on in the creative and practical activities of literary resistance. Moreover, because literary resistance is politically organized, it must organize all literary workers into the united front of the anti-Japanese national salvation revolution, so it is even more necessary to particularly emphasize and focus on the technically organized nature, which can organize a broad range of writers or literary youth for collective creation, making it its basic creative method. Through its technical organization, it will build the political organization of literary resistance.

Collective creation is a new path in the development of thousands of years of artistic practice, a new technology in human literary creation. This new technology is already being applied in practice by various international writers, and it has already achieved good results. For example, "One Day of the World," "History of the Civil War," and "History of the Factory," hosted by the great Soviet writer Maxim Gorky, and the "Encyclopedia" edited by the International Association for the Defense of Culture, are all excellent achievements of collective creation by international writers. As for China, we can also see "One Day of China," edited by the Chinese Literature Society, "The 25,000 Li March," edited by Ding Ling, and many other excellent creative plays and novels. All these artistic achievements are sufficient to prove that collective creation is a sound and precise creative method, proving the excellence of this method in reflecting reality.

So-called collective creation refers to organizing a group of writers to engage in creation together under a specific key program outline, or under a specific theme and subject matter, collectively handling the expression of the theme, collectively engaging in the collection of materials, and even the artistic generalization, structure, layout, the development of the theme, the character, posture, speech, behavior, and descriptive techniques of the characters, and the choice of language and rhetoric, all of which are discussed and determined collectively. The creative activity is then completed through the collective process of expression and modification. This creative method can integrate the literary techniques and styles, personalities, and understandings of various writers into new artistic crystallizations, thereby creating more abundant and excellent collective literary works than individual creation. As for whether a writer's participation in collective creation will limit his personal special talents and the development of his genius, our answer to this question is negative. We know that collectivism and individuality (the individual) are not opposed. Collectivism merely unifies each individual within a correct cognitive framework, guiding and influencing individuality, so that it transforms itself in the process of practice. Therefore, a literary resistance writer's participation in collective creation will not only not hinder the development of his individuality and genius, but also, due to the collective's supervision, guidance, and influence, the writer's subjectivity will be able to increasingly develop along with the objective reality of resistance, his genius will become more perfect, and his individuality and style will be able to obtain good development, overcoming his own inherent shortcomings, so that his genius, individuality, style, and understanding are all integrated into collective practice, creating higher-level and more excellent collective artistic crystallizations. This collective artistic crystallization has a higher level of significance in terms of artistic value.

### "Comprehensive Mirror for Governance"

— Tian Yu

These past few days, I happened to read Yuwen Mouzhao's "History of the Great Jin Dynasty" and saw the articles on the enthronement of Zhang Bangchang and Liu Yu by the Jin emperor. After carefully reading these two articles, I deeply admire the intelligence of the Jin emperor. His tone of cordiality is truly similar to that of people today, and his wishful thinking plans are also similar to those of people today. This is truly a mirror for our times, so I borrow the four characters "Comprehensive Mirror for Governance" as the title and excerpt them below for public appreciation:

(1) Proclamation Establishing Zhang Bangchang:

"... Considering that the Song dynasty was truly a friendly neighbor... Heaven was disgusted with their virtue, and the people could not make a living: yet they still sought to blame others and did not know how to reflect on themselves... Therefore, His Majesty ordered generals to punish the guilty and comfort the people... Now that the country lacks a ruler, the people should be united. However, considering its origins, it was truly not a poor land, so the Marshal's Office was ordered to recommend a worthy man..."

(2) Proclamation Establishing Liu Yu:

"... Not annexing your territory shows the virtue of not being greedy; only moving its ruler demonstrates the heart of punishing the guilty... We hereby appoint you, Liu Yu... Living in a chaotic country, born in an unfavorable era. Even a hundred-mile talent cannot compensate for the fall of Yu, and the lofty Three Benevolences may wish to serve the Zhou... Granting you territory, together with the former Chu; further, you must appease and gather the people, and reside where you are suitable. May you above conform to Heaven's will, and below follow the people's desires, be loyal in protecting the royal house, and faithful in guarding the borders..."

Look! In the first article, phrases like "punishing the guilty and comforting the people" and "truly not greedy for land" are so high-sounding and grand. The second article reiterates at the beginning "truly not greedy for land"; the middle section praises Liu Yu as much as possible, elevating the status of the traitor, how could the traitors not be moved to tears; the final paragraph instructs the traitor's task, which is to establish a new order and become a slave of the Great Jin. These two articles are well-organized and profound in meaning. I feel that the Jin emperor can be considered the inventor of "using Chinese to control Chinese"!

### Ruins and Gunsmoke

— Written by Shiro Ozaki, Translated by Huanping Lin

A couple came to the battlefield together, which of course required great determination. In the conversation, the life of this photographer unconsciously became the center of our interest. A slender town stretches along the lakeside. The houses on both sides, the roofs, have all collapsed. Seeing that the property of every civilian is scattered haphazardly in the countryside, it is clear that the residents have all fled alone. According to Colonel Inoue, the town of Hukou was not destroyed by shelling and explosions, but by the sound waves of the shells. There was no wind disaster, no flood, and no earthquake in thousands of years. Is it possible that the old buildings, which had preserved their vitality in decline, were destroyed by the sound of man-made shells? Thinking about it this way, the town of Hukou, which had suppressed the leisurely human emotions in its old history and survived to this day, has been reduced to ruins and perished. However, it may not be possible for the residents to return safely and immediately resume their previous lives. The tiles of the roof, which had collapsed horizontally, would immediately be pressed into the tiles by my fingertip. It is a bit incredible to think that such dilapidated houses have been able to withstand the wind and rain until now. In such an old city, the citizens seemed to be living day by day under fanatical emotions. Looking into the doorways of the destroyed houses, every house had a blackened altar in the depths. The anti-Japanese sentiment stirred up by the government was not produced by theory, but seemed to have dissolved into their beliefs unconsciously over the years. The walls of the large warehouses and the stone walls of the temples, like those in other places, were covered with fierce propaganda slogans. I had just seen the slogans "Roar, China!" and "The Three Principles of the People are the Doctrine of National Salvation!", but I immediately discovered that in the middle of the street, in front of a small Western-style building with the sign "Hukou Branch of the Shanghai Shen Bao," there was a large slogan covered in fresh ink: "Good men should shed their blood on the battlefield." Outside the city, there was a house with a magnificent facade, with neatly arranged signs hanging on both sides of the door. Reading them one by one: "Hukou County Judicial Office," "Hukou County Government Tax Collection Office," "Jiangxi Hukou County Branch of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee," "Hukou County Police Team," "Hukou County Anti-Japanese Propaganda Department," "Jiangxi Provincial Air Defense Association Hukou County Branch," "Hukou County Social Military Training General Affairs Department," "Jiangxi Province Hukou County Veterans Association," "Hukou County New Life Movement Promotion Association"—

On the roof, like unifying all the institutions, hung a wooden plaque: "Long-Term Resistance I". The intention of the national government to promote all functions and cultivate anti-Japanese feelings is deeply rooted in the shade of these neatly arranged signs. On the opposite side of the mountains surrounding the three sides, the guerrillas were still active. Hukou was still surrounded by the × people (referring to our army, similarly below - translator). The small Japanese army constantly moved its troops to contain the × people. The large units of the × people appeared and disappeared unpredictably, so they could not rest easy for a moment. Colonel Inoue also took a small steamship to navigate the riverbank to detect the deep water the day before yesterday. It was dawn, the fog was gradually dissipating, and it was clearing up. From the opposite bank in front of us, we saw people waving the Rising Sun Flag. Confirming that they were Japanese soldiers, they steered the boat to the opposite bank. When they reached the shore, they saw five or six soldiers lying collapsed on the dew-covered grass as if they were dead. The one waving the flag was the sergeant, and the three fallen soldiers were his subordinates. While walking on the street, Colonel Inoue said in a focused tone. Yes, yes - a man with an interesting name. He's called Sergeant Hiwei. He was sent out as a scout two days ago to detect whether there were × positions. At some point, he walked into the large unit of the enemy gathered at the foot of the mountain. He couldn't move forward or backward, all around him were enemies. He finally managed to reach this riverbank, it was seven o'clock the next afternoon. In short, it was extremely hard work. He didn't know if it was safe to go in that direction, he didn't eat or drink, and he couldn't go five miles away from the Yangtze River bank. In the end, his body couldn't move any more and he collapsed. (To be continued)

### Echo

— Translated by Pian Yao

The dense jungle, through the faint light of a cold moon, casts scattered, old shadows of branches on the ground. From the gaps between the tree trunks, one can faintly hear one or two dog barks and see one or two dim fishing lights in the distance. Here, over a hundred young people have gathered, all of whom are wanderers from distant places, having lost their homes and villages. They have been wandering for more than a month, walking over two hundred miles, having avoided × people's bombing and burning, and finally arrived here.

They share one heart, one unyielding, fearless determination to die for their country; preparing to depart tomorrow, they take advantage of this quiet, moonlit night to discuss everything in that broad, dense forest.

They are all sitting on the ground, some with handbooks and pencils in their hands, earnestly writing. Suddenly, on top of a half-collapsed earthen wall, stands a man in a Zhongshan suit, with dark skin and a dusty face, about thirty years old, holding a few books (or perhaps these are official documents), speaking to the crowd.

This is probably the captain. He shouts excitedly and resolutely: "Comrades! From this moment on, we are all one family. Everyone in this group has no home. Our parents, brothers, sisters have all been brutally murdered by the × people. What else do we have to worry about?"

At this point, two sixteen or seventeen-year-old girls in the队伍 were moved and wiped away their tears with their face towels. However, under the bright moonlight, they were immediately discovered by the captain.

"Comrades! Change your attitude! We should not be sentimental, we should be indignant, we should not shed tears, we should understand, who made us like this? This question can only be truly answered by our resolute struggle..."

"...Tomorrow, we will return to continue our work. Before we depart, if each squad has any questions, feel free to raise them now."

After the captain finished speaking, everyone was silent for a few minutes. Suddenly, a squad leader stood up and asked: "Commander, the comrades in our squad have a common opinion, which is to request the cotton-padded clothes from above. At the same time, we hope to be armed."

The captain replied without hesitation: "Currently, because we cannot communicate with the higher authorities, the issue of cotton-padded clothes will be temporarily shelved. As long as everyone maintains a courageous spirit, the cold will not be too noticeable; as for bullets, we must remember the outline of guerrilla tactics, and only open fire when the enemy reaches a certain distance, within the standard of our range. We must avoid firing haphazardly, wasting bullets. When necessary, we can seize the × people's yellow-uniform clothing to keep us warm, and seize the × people's weapons and food to be our weapons and food." Everyone was excited by these words. Finally, the captain asked everyone for a firm response, which was: "Our squad will share life and death, advance and retreat together, are you all willing?"

"Willing!" Like thunder, it shook the silent jungle, and over a hundred hands were raised high. Everyone was almost moved to tears, and finally returned to the ranks sadly and solemnly, and walked out of the forest, singing loudly:

"...We must defend our motherland,

We all rush to the battlefield...

...Defend...breaking through all evil forces

Implementing—implementing the principles of the Premier..." (Song of Departure.)

The crystal-clear moon has set in the west, the sky is only flickering with a few dim stars, the rooster has crowed loudly, the forest has returned to its original silence, only hearing the magnificent echo of a piece of 'Departure' song.

### Fascist Elites

— Bai Ying

Today, literary figures in fascist countries have only two paths: one is to submit to the authority of fascism, the higher-ups manufacturing distorted and deceptive "theories" for fascism, and the lower-ups simply acting as cheerleaders; the other path is to go underground, engaging in heroic struggles against fascism. So, ultimately, the only true path is the latter. Although the former is a temporary path, it is actually a dead end.

But just as Jesus said, "The gate of heaven is narrow, and only a few can enter." The true path for literary figures in fascist countries is also extremely narrow. Without absolute faith in justice and truth, without a spirit that sacrifices personal life and above, it is difficult to step onto this path. Thus, we see the large-scale appearance of so-called "turncoat" literary figures.

In fascist countries, literary "conversion" signifies the decline of literary figures. It shows that these people once were fascinated by truth, or even fought for truth. But because their faith was weak, they could not withstand the threat of violence, and as a result, they had to "turn" towards a dead end. However, as mentioned in another article, whether in international politics, domestic politics, or in personal beliefs, concession to fascism is tantamount to digging one's own grave. From the following "salute" of Japanese fascists to the "converted" literary figures, we can see that a "converted" literary figure's one misstep results in eternal regret.

"...Many turncoats, like autumn leaves, have fallen from the proletarian movement. I cannot help but angrily denounce them. This is not because they left my camp. From a standpoint, they are even closer to me. However, I really feel uncomfortable with the lack of integrity of this kind of thinking. Turning is turning, but waiting until the movement is in difficulty and then turning again is extremely despicable.

'It is strange that Japanese society can tolerate so many fickle characters.' (Sugiama Hei’suke, 'China, the Chinese People, and Japan,' page 140)

'Until recently, people who have been breathing in the air of liberalism have suddenly transformed themselves into warriors for mainland advancement, and have unusually mocked the people of neighboring countries. The motives for this behavior are not asked for the moment, but where have these people's intellects gone? Where have their years of theories and integrity flowed to?

The same can be said for converts to Marxism. Until recently, Marx's and Engels' trumpeters believed that truth only existed in these people's pens, and measured everything from this perspective. They looked down on, ignored, denounced, and attacked everything else, with the idea that the earth would soon be transformed into Marx's kingdom: they single-mindedly preached this gospel and regarded themselves as martyrs. But at what point did these people suddenly start preaching Eastern culture, Japanese culture, and appearing as new players in the East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere?' (Murofushi Takanobu, article 'Reconstruction of Intellect,' 'Japan Review,' January issue)

At first glance, one might think that this is a battle between Japanese liberals and Marxist warriors scolding their traitors, but in reality, it is the sneer of fascist mouthpieces towards "converted" literary figures. Although they put on a moral face on the back and gave a "salute" with ulterior motives, in our opinion, the patting is useful, and the mockery only shows that they have "foresight". They have already thrown themselves at the master, and show a hideous face to the "converted" who want to share a piece of the reward.

People with little faith, the bone you are coveting is already in someone else's mouth!

But in our country, if those who are迷于 Trotkyist and pro-Han ideas are willing to suddenly wake up, the significance of this and the "conversion" of the Japanese people are absolutely different, because the watershed here is justice. There is no ridicule, no sarcasm here, but a welcome to the lost sheep.
