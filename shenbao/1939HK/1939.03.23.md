### Recent Movements of the Invading Japanese Army

As the situation in Europe becomes increasingly tense, the position of the Soviet Union becomes ever more important. Its prestige among freedom-loving and peace-loving people around the world is also increasing. Its friendly relations with democratic and peaceful countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Russia, and Turkey are becoming clearer. The entire international situation has begun to show a trend that is clearly unfavorable to fascist aggressors. At this moment, the Japanese aggressors cannot help but feel extremely hesitant and distressed. Their political conspiracy to "use Chinese to control Chinese" by using Chinese traitors, rebels, and pro-Japanese elements has suffered a major blow at its foundation. The anti-war surge within Japan and its army is transforming from thought to action and from a small number of enlightened individuals to a broad group movement. As Japan faces increasingly serious internal and external crises and the failure of its political conspiracy, it has resorted to launching new, even more shameless and vicious secret political schemes to sow discord among our parties and undermine our sustained resistance. It is also eagerly taking advantage of the unsettled European situation to once again carry out risky military offensives, attempting to remedy its political failure and dreaming of finally completing its plan to conquer China.

Judging from the war situation across the country in the past few days, fierce battles still occur from time to time in various parts of North China, but there have been no major changes. Although a major battle in South China is actively brewing, on the surface, there are no surprising developments either. What is particularly noteworthy is the recent Japanese attempt in various war zones in Central China. In the Hubei central area, the Japanese army, at the cost of great sacrifices, has launched offensives along both the Jingzhong and Hanyi routes. For a time, they claimed to be advancing to seize Yishan and Yichang and launching a large-scale attack on Shaanxi and Sichuan, especially claiming to seize Chongqing, in order to scare people. In reality, even if the Japanese army had the intention of taking risks, it lacks the power to advance. Therefore, its main attempt is to contain our heavy troops in western Hubei, the vanguard of Sichuan and Shaanxi provinces, and to cover the movements of the Japanese armies in Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi, as well as Japanese warships in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and along the coast. According to yesterday's war report, the following points are particularly noteworthy: First, the Japanese army's activities in eastern Zhejiang. Japanese planes have been bombing and harassing Wenzhou and other places for days. At the same time, a large fleet of Japanese warships has gathered in Hangzhou Bay and along the coast of eastern Zhejiang. Japanese troops on the north bank of the Qiantang River have also repeatedly shelled the south bank. The Chinese side yesterday also announced that the enemy landed in the Xiaoshan area on the 21st of this month, and will spy on Yin County along the railway and attack Jinhua. This action by the Japanese is clearly aimed at cutting off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi-Hunan Railway in order to support the Japanese army in Central China in its attack on Nanchang. Second, the war situation near the shores of Poyang Lake has suddenly become tense in recent days. The fighting along the Xiu River is particularly fierce. The Japanese army has intensified its use of a large amount of poison gas and launched fierce attacks across the river. Its intention to go straight to Nanchang is self-evident. In the Japanese plan, if they capture Nanchang from northern Jiangxi and eastern Zhejiang, they can then join forces with the Japanese troops in Hubei and Hunan in the west, drive straight to Changsha, open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, respond to the Japanese troops in the South China Sea and southern Guangdong in the south, and attack Guangxi and Yunnan. In retreat, they can also cut off our hinterland transportation, strengthen their rule over the occupied areas in North China and several southeastern provinces, actively reorganize their troops, train puppet troops, plunder civilian labor, and slowly make progress.

However, we should also be aware that, based on the experiences and lessons of more than twenty months of aggressive war, the Japanese seem to be deeply aware of the fact that the Chinese nation cannot be conquered. Therefore, the Japanese military strategy has also undergone major changes. Its central policy is: (1) To attempt to shift from point and line occupation to area occupation, that is, from the occupation of major cities and transportation lines to the comprehensive destruction of the countryside. (2) To attempt to "eliminate" our main forces and cut off our supply routes in order to "finally eradicate" the basis for our resistance against aggression and striving for independence and freedom. In order to realize the first attempt, there are the recent mopping-up operations in our guerrilla areas in North China and the recent "Nanchang offensive" in Central China. In order to realize its second attempt, there is also its inevitable trend of intensifying its attacks on our Northwest, especially on our Southwest. Because the Japanese believe that the main force of our protracted resistance and the strong foreign aid are all in the Northwest and Southwest, and especially concentrated in the Southwest. This is the important reason why, in addition to guarding against Japanese military conspiracies in Central China, we still cannot but pay attention to preventing their Northwest and Southwest strategies, especially the Southwest strategy.

This new trend and attempt by the invading Japanese army can prove that all lurking and overt anti-communist and peace advocates are traitors and collaborators, because they use the smoke screen of anti-communism and peace to deceive our people, sow discord in our unity, cover up the cruel and vicious new offensive of the Japanese, and plunge our nation and country into an irrecoverable abyss! On the other hand, it can prove that in this increasingly favorable international situation, further preventing and打击ing the Japanese and Chinese traitors is still a matter of urgency! We should not be dazzled by past successes. We must redouble our vigilance against new conspiracies and new offensives of the Japanese and Chinese traitors. We must redouble our efforts to enhance the combat effectiveness of the front lines, cultivate new forces in the rear, and especially launch large-scale guerrilla warfare in the Japanese-occupied and occupied areas. It is particularly important to coordinate with the new environment of the thorough development of the international peace front. We must not only step up efforts to win more and more practical foreign aid, but also step up the military, economic, and especially political progress of our country. If we can do this, then any new offensive and new conspiracy of the Japanese and Chinese traitors will not be feared!

### Women and Families in New China

— Soong Mei-ling

Past history has left behind many glorious records of women. Women of the present generation must also embellish the history of the present era with equally outstanding achievements. Because women today are developing, women today have a national vision, and because human wisdom, career, courage, learning, and far-sightedness are no longer the exclusive domain of men, women should make more contributions. Women are no weaker than men and have the innate qualities of compassion and harmony. These unique qualities make women more suitable for special services in the great task of our entire nation's resistance against Japan and nation-building. In fact, the contributions of Chinese women in the war of resistance are multifaceted. Even the obligation to serve as soldiers, proudly wearing heroic military uniforms and listening to the roar of artillery, is no longer the exclusive privilege of men. Chinese women have long used practical actions to prove their extraordinary perseverance: they can indeed endure the hardships of life on the battlefield; they can indeed stand firm and unshaken in the raging tide of earth-shattering warfare. The fact that countless young women have been sent to the front lines after receiving training is enough to make those men who shout high-sounding slogans about being willing to sacrifice for the country but actually hide in the rear, far from the front lines of heroic resistance, or hide in safe areas and do nothing, feel ashamed.

In the work of striving for victory in the war of resistance and completing the national rejuvenation, women's contributions are now becoming increasingly important. Men say: "Women account for half of the country's population, so they should also bear half of the responsibility for arduous work." If this argument is reasonably inferred, then should women also enjoy half of the rights and half of the glory? We have not thought of this point. What they think about is how to support the war of resistance. They believe that every citizen must take national victory as the basic concept. However, men should not forget what rights women should enjoy. Although women's demands for liberation are recent, they have independent personalities, and they are also members of the country, just as their being women is an indisputable grand principle.

In the past, the lives of Chinese women were restricted, closed, and isolated. They were not allowed to participate in national affairs; they became a tool in the family; or, conversely, it seemed that they possessed a so-called "charming" quality, only worthy of being raised and enshrined in the family as a decoration. The failure of Chinese women's knowledge, ability, and status to improve for so many years is not their own fault.

Today's women are different. They have broken through the restrictions that have always prevented them from participating in public affairs, jumped out of the shackles that hinder their contribution of wisdom and ability, and are working hard to promote social and political reforms and promote national development. In these great works, the contribution of women is indispensable. They can provide a kind of vitality and driving force to promote the success of all undertakings.

Women, take up the responsibility! Deeply establish the foundation for the revival of the nation with patriotic enthusiasm and loyal virtues. They should guarantee the future of our country, with solid unity and eternal dignity. They can create an atmosphere of loyalty, generosity, and integrity, and make it popular in the family, flow into the society, and benefit the country. As long as they are given appropriate opportunities and effective organization, they can do it one by one. After women are organized, they can also improve the thoughts and attitudes of each member, as well as the relationship between treating people and helping things, which is also eternally beneficial to mankind.

There are many women in Chinese history who deserve our respect and admiration; there are also some who are not enough to be models, but their facts can provide us with lessons. There have been excellent Chinese women in all dynasties. In terms of literature, there was Ban Zhao of the Han Dynasty, who wrote seven chapters of "Lessons for Women." Others such as Madam Wei, Li Qingzhao, and Madam Guan were all talented and unparalleled, not inferior to men. There are also women who were praised as female heroes, such as Hua Mulan, Liang Hongyu, and Qin Liangyu. They actually fought in battle, climbed the city to kill the enemy, and showed the talent of commanding troops to defend the country. In addition, there are countless virtuous mothers who educated their children to become famous and were enthusiastic about patriotism. They all dedicated their wisdom, ability, and excellent characteristics to protect the survival and development of our nation. On the contrary, there are also women who are considered harmful to the country, such as Daji, Baosi, Wu Zetian, and Yang Guifei. They either created harmful disputes or gave the emperors of the time bad influences, causing them to become faint and degenerate, causing harm to the country and the people. If what is written in history is true, of course, these people should be criticized by historians and abandoned by later generations. But what was the actual situation at that time? We cannot be without doubt at this time, and we cannot completely believe what historians say. Was the character of women at that time so bad? Because Chinese historians of all dynasties are men, their records of women inevitably have exaggerated statements? However, the martyrs such as Qiu Jin in modern history can raise their eyebrows for our women. She was an educator and a revolutionary. She did not hesitate to sacrifice everything to carry out the revolution, and as a result, suffered the poisonous hands of the Qing government. Now her tomb stands majestically on the shore of West Lake, for all to admire and respect forever.

Ban Zhao's deeds are really worth further detailed description. She was the younger sister of Ban Gu, a famous historian of the Han Dynasty. After Ban Gu's death, she continued to complete the unfinished work of writing history. That was the sixth century BC. Although she did not get the official position of Lan Hu Ling Shi, she also went in and out of the palace to lecture the Queen. She also established a famous principle for the education of Chinese women: that is, the three obediences and four virtues that everyone knows. The "two obediences" she advocated are obedience to the father before marriage, obedience to the husband after marriage, and obedience to the son after the husband's death. The "four virtues" are feminine virtue, feminine speech, feminine appearance, and feminine work. She believed that a perfect woman should be mediocre. Although this doctrine hindered the development of women, it was also very suitable for her time and environment.

Contemporary critics, after reading Ban Zhao's works, think that this kind of proposition is enough to hinder the development of women and depress their status. For hundreds of years, the doctrine of three obediences and four virtues has fueled the authority of men to suppress women, confine women in the family, and block their desire to participate in public and social life. Chinese women have only now been able to liberate themselves from the painful pressure of life, and Ban Zhao's proposition should be responsible for this. But I think that in her time, this view was not wrong, but now that the times have changed, we must also make changes with the trend of the times. The truth that was considered correct in the past cannot be entirely suitable for modern women who embrace the idea of ​​liberation or wear military uniforms.

Everything in life is relative, and all doctrines and propositions have their relative temporality and cannot be unchangeable. However, Ban Zhao has a basic idea, which is an eternal truth, that is, what she calls "virtue is more important than talent." In my opinion, it is of course best for a perfect woman to have both talent and virtue. If we have to choose one between "talent" and "virtue," we would rather take virtue first and talent second. In other words: virtue is more important than everything.

All young women should keep this truth firmly in mind and turn it into their eternal belief. The cultivation of women's self-esteem is the foundation for creating personality and all careers. In the youth period when it is easiest to go astray, only by paying attention to morality can they resist the temptation of modern decadent life and avoid the common undesirable phenomena between male and female students.

The disadvantages of women's lives in the past were that they were too strictly bound, and now that they are given freedom, the disease is that they are too indulgent. Young women suddenly break away from the constraints of their parents and are not yet accustomed to independence and freedom. To overcome the dangers that arise from this, they must have a firm will. Indulgence and willfulness are often mistaken for the true meaning of freedom, which is very painful, but most of it is the responsibility of the parents. Perhaps because the old family system of high pressure was abolished too suddenly. Perhaps because the unrestrained movement of young people who are not taught came too violently, making parents panic and have no intention or leisure to make spiritual adjustments for them and establish basic guarantees to cope with this new era. Young people then went out to compile wild horses that are difficult to tame. Now we can only let educators use their wisdom and moral experience to guide the boiling energy and enthusiasm of young people to work that is beneficial to the country.

Parents of a family, if they cannot completely restrain their children, should also repeatedly take on the responsibility of teaching. For grown-up juniors, they should set an example and give less empty advice. Young people are easily tired of repetitive instructions. If the behavior of parents does not match the words of advice, they will not be able to attract their attention. Any woman, if she wants to contribute to the progress of the country, must be a virtuous wife and good mother, and at the same time a good citizen. We should also use this as a standard to educate our younger generations. If she cannot be a good citizen, she cannot be a virtuous wife and good mother. On the contrary, a person who cannot be a virtuous wife and good mother is definitely not a good citizen. And she will definitely not be practical and dedicated to the country and herself.

The duties of modern mothers are no different from those of ancient mothers, but modern duties are more important. In the past, there were many mothers who painstakingly taught their children, not only to educate their children as sound members of the family, but also to help them become good citizens who are beneficial to the country. This principle is even more urgently needed at present. Because there is a group of brutal enemies who are invading our territory waiting for us to work hard to abolish them, and there are many bad influences given to us by the enemy waiting for us to wash away and sweep away. This cause of resisting Japan and building the country requires long-term efforts. If the current generation does not have time to complete the great cause of national rejuvenation and cannot completely wash away all the shame of the enemy's insults and killings of our compatriots, the younger generation must continue to carry out the task of continuing to complete this task.

During the war of resistance, many people worthy of our respect emerged. Most of these people are indebted to their mother's teachings. Their mothers have completed the responsibility of training and nurturing, but today's mothers have more important responsibilities to the country and the younger generation compared to the past. Because to complete the cause of resisting Japan and building the country, we must cultivate a large number of talents to continue to shoulder the work of breaking through difficulties. This arduous work should be started by mothers from themselves. First, they must make courageous improvements in their personality. They must eliminate the shortcomings of timidity, selfishness, and indifference, and establish the willingness to work continuously for the war of resistance. There are now many jobs waiting for intellectuals to work hard. Some educated women, don't put their patriotic and enthusiastic minds in the refrigerator as soon as they get married, so that their minds become withered wood, like dead ashes. They should immediately reflect on themselves, encourage patriotic enthusiasm, and do their best to fulfill their duties as a citizen. Otherwise, the government and society should use active methods to promote them, and even force them to come out to share the burden of saving the country.

This is not a time to enjoy leisure. Everyone should know that those who are drunk and dream of death and refuse to take responsibility will either be eliminated before the end of this war, or they will be difficult to escape the criticism of history. They will be despised by the masses and abandoned by the whole country, because this habit is shameful and tantamount to treason. All mothers whose sons are about to reach adulthood should train them and contribute them to the work of saving the country; all those whose sons have reached adulthood should encourage them to shoulder their guns to protect the great heritage of their ancestors and completely drive out the enemies who have insulted our country and trampled on our female compatriots.

After the victory of the war of resistance, we still have many tasks to do. On the ashes of the devastated country, we must create a new China. All mothers should enlighten their children's minds and prepare for this great cause that comes once in a millennium. After our psychological habits have changed, the awakening of conscience will be able to appear quickly. Based on this awakening, every citizen will be able to bear the country's work seriously and effectively and advance the interests of the entire nation. The University Records contain Confucius's explicit instruction:

"Only when the heart is upright can the person be cultivated, only when the person is cultivated can the family be regulated, only when the family is regulated can the country be governed, and only when the country is governed can the world be at peace."

These famous words, in this time of extreme need for the country, are enough to encourage all the women compatriots of the country to contribute all our abilities and enthusiasm to the common goal of everyone's efforts, to do our best and our strength to help the struggling motherland, defeat the evil Japanese, and then we can raise our eyebrows and shout loudly: Resurgam——"I will rise again!"

### On the Implementation of Compulsory Education for Women

— Qiu Hong

The Shen Bao published on March 17th: The Hong Kong Women's Commemoration of the March 8th Festival Preparatory Committee passed the outline for the implementation of future work, the main points of which are: A. Promoting and implementing mass education; B. Promoting the national goods movement; C. Strengthening and expanding women's organizations at all levels; D. Promoting the thrift movement; E. Participating in wartime training; F. Assisting and giving preferential treatment to military families and actively promoting childcare; G. Expanding international propaganda; H. Promoting women's production enterprises, etc. … The passage of this resolution has a very great significance. This plan is completely correct and suitable for the current urgent needs. Our main task at present is how to realize this plan. I would like to put forward my opinions and hope to discuss them with our comrades in the women's movement.

I believe that at present, the awareness level and organizational strength of the broad masses of women are still very low and weak. Under such objective circumstances, we must intensify our focus on education. Only by intensifying the implementation of widespread mass education, giving women at all levels a correct understanding and sound organization, can we smoothly complete the task of mobilizing the broad masses of women to participate in the war!

How to implement mass education for women?

First: To truly go deep into the broad masses. In the past, many social groups have run many mass schools, but the results have not been good. It took a lot of effort to recruit students, and not many students were recruited. Or when school started, many came, but after a month or two, the students gradually ran away. The reason for this is that the work plans and working methods of our comrades are actually only suitable for closed rooms and do not meet the objective needs, and do not take into account the local environment. We have not clearly seen where they are, who to educate, what methods and ways to use, and what kind of materials to give them. Now, we should use these experiences and lessons.

First of all, we must strive for the sympathy of families and factories. In the past, many workers did not dare to come out to study and participate in the national salvation movement because of various reasons in the factory or family. We, women's organizations, must understand the difficulties of these oppressed masses, be good at solving these difficulties for them, and be good at persuading these stubborn parents and biased factory owners and supervisors; strive for women's freedom to study, freedom to participate in the national salvation movement, and freedom to participate in women's organizations, and in terms of working methods, try to avoid giving them (family, factory) unnecessary misunderstandings.

Secondly, pay attention to the students' time and energy. Class time should not conflict with working hours, and should not be too much or too intimidating. Do not casually complain about students being lazy, understand their difficulties, and accommodate their time as much as possible. It is best to strive for the factory to follow the Hong Kong Labor Law, which stipulates that female workers should not work past 8 pm at night. That would give female workers more opportunities to learn.

Thirdly, the content of the curriculum is also very important. We cannot talk about anti-Japanese war theory all the time, nor can we always use the same old set of letter-writing formulas, argumentation enlightenment, etc. Our curriculum should meet the requirements of the students and also meet the requirements of the times: we must let them gain an understanding of the anti-Japanese war in their pursuit of knowledge, and at the same time, in their understanding of the anti-Japanese war, improve their spirit of learning. Only education with such content is the most practical education.

Finally, we should also pay attention to the economic ability of a group of working women, and do as much as possible to achieve completely free compulsory education. Do not do it like many "so-called free schools" that hang a sheep's head and sell dog meat, do not charge tuition, but charge one or two yuan of deposit, or collect several times the classroom fees and miscellaneous fees, and as a result, still reject the broad masses outside the door.

Second: We must mobilize thousands upon thousands of knowledgeable women and female students to be responsible for this education work. Without teachers, schools cannot be run; especially to do this kind of extensive work, more responsible cadres are needed. We should use forms such as education service groups or voluntary education work teams to organize many enthusiastic and active knowledgeable women, give them necessary training, and assign them work in a planned manner; promote student unions in various schools in a planned manner, use after-school time to implement voluntary education, and in the process of voluntary education, not only educate the broad masses of uneducated people, but also organize the cadres who have received higher education and improve the education level and ability of the cadres. Only in this way can we carry out correct compulsory education and cultivate more talents for the women's movement.

Third: The realization of this plan requires more organized leadership. Therefore, establish a Mass Education Work Implementation Committee as the overall leadership to develop the entire specific plan; lead and supervise, and inspect the implementation of these plans. At the same time, establish cadre organizations such as education service groups at the lower level to regularly collectively implement the specific work of each district and unit, and deeply carry out this meaningful movement into the masses and into society; this is work that can be spoken and done. offer

Every year, there is a grand commemoration meeting for the March 8th Festival, and every year, there are relatively satisfactory resolutions. Should this year's meeting be a reality next year? I have no extravagant hopes, only the hope that one or two of this huge plan can be completed.

### × There is a trend of large-scale invasion　Our military has new preparations　The focus of the war is currently still in Jiangxi and Hubei　The total number of troops on each battlefield is around one million

[Special telegram from Chongqing on the 22nd of this newspaper] Based on the situation on each battlefield, × seems to have a trend of large-scale invasion against us. However, the total number of × within our borders is still around one million, and there is no large increase. In addition to those guarding the strongholds, the maximum number of troops that can attack is only a large-scale attack on one or two war zones. Our new military preparations are stronger than before and sufficient to deal with it. The focus of the war is still in Jiangxi and Hubei. × is constantly increasing on the east bank of the Xiang River. There are more than two regiments of × across the Shayang River. About one regiment is at Luohan Temple and Dengjiachang, and Zengjialing. About 2,000 people are in Zhongxiang. More than one regiment of × is at Yuekou. About one division is at Anlu and Xihe. They have been repeatedly trying to cross the west bank of the Xiang River for days, and they have all been annihilated by us. As of the 21st, they are still fighting across the river. We are launching a new strategy, and the war situation is gradually improving.

Jiangxi × Troops Advance South in Multiple Routes

[Associated Press Chongqing, 22nd] A Chinese military spokesman announced that a Japanese troop crossed the Xiu River north of Nanchang on the 18th of this month, posing a threat to the front of Nanchang. At the same time, another Japanese troop also landed in Wucheng on the west bank of Poyang Lake on the 18th, making it easier for the Japanese to launch an attack on Nanchang. Currently, the Japanese army is using an entire division to exert pressure on the front of Nanchang, and another division is attacking Wuning, hoping to threaten the left wing of the Chinese army in Nanchang. They are still rapidly reinforcing from Jiujiang. In addition, 2,000 Japanese troops landed on the east bank of Poyang Lake on the 14th. As for the war in central Hubei, the spokesman said that the Japanese army tried to cross the Xiang River, but after three days of fierce fighting, they failed due to the strong resistance of the Chinese artillery. The Japanese army is currently reorganizing its remnants and waiting for reinforcements.

[Reuters Tokyo, 22nd] Since the Japanese army occupied Hankou, they have launched a large-scale offensive in Zhejiang Province for the first time. The Japanese army is attempting to advance along the Qiantang River and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The front line is as long as 600 li. Soldiers transferred from North China and part of the navy are participating in a joint operation with the Japanese army in Central China.

[Reuters Tokyo, 22nd] The largest-scale offensive since the Japanese army occupied Hankou has already begun in Zhejiang Province. The Chinese army deployed along the Qiantang River and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is no less than 800,000 people. Japan is redeploying troops stationed in North China and the navy to reinforce the Japanese army in Central China.

Henan × Troops Are Still Restless

[Special telegram from Chongqing on the 22nd of this newspaper] According to reports, Henan × troops are still restless. Since the 17th, × planes have been harassing Zhengzhou and Luoyang every day. Especially on the 20th, hundreds of bombs were dropped in Zhengzhou, bombing civilians, which was extremely brutal. × in Wenxian and on the north bank of Sishui continue to increase, shelling the south bank, trying to cross the river. We are strictly defending and there is no danger. Henan East × cavalry have repeatedly harassed Laitongzhai east of Huayuankou, but they have all been repelled. × in Xinxiang has also increased to more than 5,000. Our new military deployment for Henan has been completed, and the defense is solid.

[Central News Agency Luoyang, 22nd] About 2,000 × troops who invaded west from Dongzhangzhen (northeast of Zhongmu) arrived at Sanliuzhai in large numbers at 7 pm on the 20th. Their advance troops of 500 to 600 people engaged in fierce battles with our alert troops in Laitongzhai and Madukou. Our alert troops fought bravely and then retreated westward. By the 21st, the advance troops of the 8th Division, 200 to 300 × troops, successively occupied Vietnam Gan on the opposite bank of the Xinhe River under the cover of artillery fire and aircraft. Our alert troops are still fighting fiercely with × troops. The troops attacking Sanliuzhai were side-attacking × troops from northeast of Zhongmu at 10 am on the 21st.

Puppet Troops Defect One After Another

[Ming Ge News Agency Hequ, 22nd] In the Baotou area, puppet troops have been increasingly oppressed by ×, and lower-level military officers have been replaced by Japanese or Mongolians. The × army is extremely shaken. Three to five of them carry weapons and surrender to us. Our troops near Baotou alone have collected 300 to 400 people. In addition, the battalion commander of a puppet army unit in Daxikou defected with his troops the day before yesterday and has now joined our tea troops. Military news, a part of the Baotou × army crossed the river to invade our Zhungeer Banner and is fighting our troops.

[Central News Agency Yulin, 21st] Xiao Jintang, commander of the 1st Division of the puppet Northwest Border Defense Army, and Xia Junchuan, commander of the 4th Division, defected with more than 1,000 of their subordinates in the area west of Guyang on January 26. After shooting and killing two Japanese advisors, they led their troops south. They encountered × troops many times along the way and engaged in fierce battles, killing and capturing countless enemies. After a journey of more than 40 days, they arrived at a certain place on the 17th of this month. The police commander of the XXXXXX reported the defection process and asked for instructions on the anti-× policy.

Fierce Fighting at Jinzhong Heilongguan

[Central News Agency Xingji, 21st] On the line from Heilongguan Tumen to Linfen, × and our troops have been fighting fiercely every day for the past week. × are constantly being attacked by us. On the 12th, more than 200 × troops invaded Yita, but they sneaked away after being attacked by our guerrillas. They were also bombarded by our mortars and fled back to Tumen. On the morning of the 13th, × troops invaded in multiple routes. One part of more than 200 troops went from Qiaoerwan to Jinfangling and encountered our interception. Another part of more than 200 troops went from Huojiaao to Sanmuli after passing through Sunjiagou to Jinliling. We launched a surprise attack on Heilongguan from Qiangechuan and a main force launched a flanking attack from Shuiquanao. After eight hours of bloody battle, × were injured and fled back. On the 14th, a group of × troops invaded Yuanshang again and were driven down the mountain. On this day, smoke and fire filled the air around Heilongguan, perhaps because × took revenge on civilians for their injuries and wantonly burned villages in an attempt to vent their anger. On the 16th, more than 200 × infantry and cavalry, with one cannon and more than 100 carts, stationed near Yuanshang from Tumen and were killed by us. On the 17th, more than 300 × troops invaded west again and were intercepted along the way in the Lingyi area. The remaining × troops fled to Heilongguan and were ambushed again on their way through Yuanshang. The × troops retreated to Tumen under the cover of artillery fire, leaving more than a dozen bodies behind. In total, nearly 500 × troops have been killed in the past week, along with more than 40 donkeys and mules. We also suffered more than 200 casualties.

[Central News Agency Xingji, 22nd] On the morning of the 12th, our artillery bombarded Heilongguan, and × were lured to attack Dongpoli, Tunli, and the southeast of Heilongguan. The × troops in Dongpoli were surrounded by our superior forces and swept away with machine guns. The × troops broke through and fled in disorder, and were intercepted by our ambushes on both sides of the road, leaving behind about 200 bodies. On the morning of the 13th, × continued to reinforce with 700 to 800 troops to counterattack. As of the afternoon, they were engaged in fierce battles near Heishanguan. In addition, more than 1,000 × troops in Mengxian recently invaded north in two routes. One part was defeated by us in Tonglu, and the other part occupied Xiashe.

### War Results on All Fronts in the First Half of This Month　100 Battles Kill More Than 10,000 × Soldiers　Sink 8 × Warships and Destroy 3 × Aircraft

### Shanghai West People's Magazine Discusses the Sino-Japanese War Situation　The Japanese People Are Tired of Continuing the Invasion of China　Uniting to Resist Aggression Makes Japan Helpless

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 22nd] Shanghai News, the well-known Far East publication "Finance and Commerce Magazine" today published an article, saying that Japanese people are now gradually understanding that the invasion of China by the Japanese can only go so far and cannot advance any further. In any case, large-scale actions by the Japanese army may not happen again. A certain Japanese newspaper said that the Japanese government, military authorities, and the Japanese people all believe that continuing to attack the Chinese army is a waste of troops and not a good strategy. Therefore, people can know where the Chinese army will retreat to. According to this, this has now become a serious problem for Japan. Before the start of the war, the Japanese side would have dramatized it. The Japanese side now hopes that the future peace movement in China will gradually reduce the guerrillas, and intends to use the names of certain people to promote peace, but all Chinese people have already understood that this person has no power in the country, and this person has also refused to come out. The situation has gradually become clear, that is, the longer the war is delayed, the more advantageous it is for China. Japan will soon understand this point and think about how to deal with it. Whether Japan's achievements in the three northeastern provinces are beneficial to Situ is still doubtful. Even if it is said that Japan has achieved something in the Northeast, it is impossible to seek the same achievements in the mainland of China. Now the National Government of China still exists, and the unity of the Chinese people is becoming stronger and stronger, which has made the Japanese side helpless. Japanese government officials have said to the outside world that China is "not a modern country, and the word China is only a geographical term," etc. All these arguments have proven to be incorrect, and it is the Japanese policy that has made China united. Although China has been deceived by the Japanese army from the coast into the interior, and most of its tax revenue has also been lost as a result, its military strength and manpower are still superior to Japan. The Chinese people are deeply angered by Japan and will definitely strike them when they have the opportunity.

### Fuzhou Air Raid

[Reuters Chongqing, 22nd] Fuzhou was bombed by × aircraft yesterday, the first time since the July 7th Incident. The × aircraft bombed twice. The Chinese side said that the losses were minimal and only one person was killed.

### Chongqing-Hami Line Regular Flights

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 22nd] The Eurasia Company's news Chongqing-Hami route will officially open on the 24th. The company has decided to send the "Lanzhou" large aircraft to take on the first flight on this route. The logo of the aircraft is the five characters for civil aviation aircraft painted on both the top and bottom of the wings, and the character for "post" on both sides of the fuselage. The entire fuselage is painted silver-gray, it is said.

### Wang Jingwei Escapes Assassination　Zeng Zhongming Dies of Serious Injuries　Zeng's Wife and Several Others Are Seriously Injured　It Is Reported That the Assassin Was Arrested and Refused to Speak

[Associated Press Shanghai, 22nd] According to a telegram from Hanoi, at about 2:00 a.m. on the 20th, several people assassinated Wang Jingwei and broke into Wang's residence and opened fire. At that time, Wang seemed not to be present, so only Zeng Zhongming and his wife were injured. Zeng was seriously injured and was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. He died of his injuries at about 4:00 p.m. yesterday. (Note: Zeng Zhongming is 44 years old this year, from Minhou, Fujian. He studied literature in France and was Wang Jingwei's right-hand man. With Wang's power, he was appointed Secretary-General of the Central Political Conference, Vice Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Railways, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, and Central Executive Committee Member. Wang defected and fled the country, and Zeng also went to Hanoi with him and was eventually shot and killed.)

[Associated Press Hanoi, 22nd] It is reported that the three Chinese who assassinated Wang Jingwei mistakenly thought Zeng Zhongming's residence was where Wang lived, while Wang actually lived next door. The assassins were all holding box cannons. Zeng and his wife were unable to escape and were both seriously injured. In addition, several others were injured. Zeng was shot four times in the abdomen and soon died.

[Hanoi, 22nd] According to Japanese Domei News Agency, the four murderers who assassinated Wang Jingwei on Monday morning have been arrested by the French police. However, despite extremely strict interrogation, they have refused to speak.

### The Truth About the Kidnapping of Dodd, President of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce, Is Revealed　Bandits Were Instructed by × to Extort 2 Million Yuan　British Consul-General Contacted × Twice Without Results

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 21st] Tianjin News, the truth about the kidnapping of Dodd, president of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce, has been completely determined. It was indeed instructed by ×. Despite repeated efforts by the British authorities, they have not been able to find his whereabouts. The British Consul-General contacted × twice yesterday and today, but there were no results. The truth of this case is that when × publicly announced that legal tender was not allowed to be used, Dodd gave a speech at the Chamber of Commerce's annual meeting, criticizing ×'s measures from a commercial standpoint, which aroused ×'s dissatisfaction. The Honma Unit stationed in Tianjin intended to deal with Dodd, so they sent bandit leader Wu Changjie to handle the matter. Wu colluded with his followers to kidnap Dodd from his residence in Special District No. 1. Afterwards, they went to Tianjin Avenue and the car broke down. So they hired a car from Zuyi Car Company and drove towards Haiguangsi. When they arrived at Baitangkou, they were detained by the local puppet authorities and militia. The local puppet police officer thought that he had done a good job in handling this matter and immediately reported to Tianjin. The × advisor immediately notified the × authorities. Each team received the news and immediately sent troops by car to Baitangkou, together with Major Osnishi of the local × army, to detain Dodd. At the same time, × said that the British authorities had learned about Dodd's matter in Baitangkou. In addition to sending a team to rob him, they also ordered the puppet police and militia not to publicize that a kidnapped Westerner had passed by here, so that after the British sent people to rush over, they could not investigate the truth and rescue Dodd. As for the reason for the exposure of the inside story, it was because this matter was handled independently by the Honma Unit. Although the × military police were not aware of it beforehand, they thought it was a general kidnapping case, so they also cooperated with the British in investigating it. Now that the content has been revealed, it is expected that the Japanese side, having handled this matter, will certainly not let Dodd return. Moreover, the × side is now buying ruffians and bandits to plan to kidnap British and American political figures and powerful businessmen in Tianjin. It is extremely thorough. The British and American authorities have ordered expatriates living in Special District No. 1 to move to the concession, and have sent additional troops to protect them in the concession.

[Reuters Tianjin, 22nd] Since Dodd, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, was kidnapped in the former German Concession on the 17th, foreigners living in Japanese-controlled areas have also moved into the British and French concessions. Therefore, all the hostels are full. The Xintai Hing Company, where Dodd serves as general manager, received a letter this morning demanding 2 million yuan to purchase bonds.

### Shanghai × Illegally Enacts Traffic Regulations North of Suzhou Creek　Specifically Restricting Foreigners Driving Cars　Municipal Council Has Protested to × Consul

[Associated Press Shanghai, 22nd] The Japanese Marine Corps here has established special traffic regulations in Hongkou. The Municipal Council has protested to the Japanese consulate, because legally, only the Municipal Council has the right to issue traffic regulations. The traffic regulations newly established by × are stricter than those issued by the Municipal Council, prohibiting car drivers from smoking while driving, increasing the number of "no parking" areas, and facilitating the passage of military vehicles.

[Shanghai Correspondent] The Shanghai × Special Marine Corps has illegally enacted traffic regulations north of Suzhou Creek, which officially took effect on the 15th. The regulations established by × are particularly inconvenient for foreigners driving cars, such as prohibiting drivers from smoking. Parking areas in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas have been strictly restricted, and the speed of cars has been restricted to no more than 30 kilometers per hour in the central area and no more than 40 kilometers per hour in the suburbs. This move seems to be aimed at recent assassination cases. It is reported that the Municipal Council immediately protested.

### The Entire Indian People Sympathize With Our Country's Resistance War　All Religions in India Unanimously Boycott × Goods　Shops Automatically Stop Purchasing

[Hong Kong News] Bishop Wood of the Chengdu Supervisory Church in Sichuan, recently accompanied by Reverend Mandu of the church in Momara, India, and Reverend Anjian of the church in Yangon, arrived in Hong Kong. The three of them went to Matterchens last year to participate in the International Missionary Conference. Wood was one of the representatives from China. He suggested that India and Myanmar should send representatives to China to promote friendship. According to Reverend Mandu, he has traveled to various parts of western China and participated in gatherings of various social groups, expressing that the 370 million people of India fully support China's war of resistance. His impressions of traveling in China are that China will fight to the end and will never admit defeat. The people participate in this sacred war, not avoiding hardships. If they can be consistent from beginning to end, Japan will eventually fail. All religions in India have now unanimously boycotted × goods, so shops in India have automatically stopped purchasing × goods. According to Reverend Anjian, people in Myanmar are quite ignorant of Chinese affairs, but those who know the methods adopted by × all express their deep sympathy for China. ×'s propaganda work in Myanmar is very active. Recently, they have also established scholarships for studying in Japan in Myanmar. He knows that what the Japanese are trying to do is nothing more than to achieve their continental policy and dominate Asia. Myanmar will become their route of advance. He will return to report on the situation of the purchases. It is heard that the two Indian pastors will stay in Shanghai for a week before returning to their country.

### A True Record of What I Saw and Heard in Laohekou

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Geng Ya

It has only been a few days since I left Xiangyang, but the city has almost completely changed. Enemy planes came again to bomb, with the targets seemingly being the towering city walls and the "Ming Zhao Wang Terrace." However, the bombing was inaccurate, and nearby civilian houses suffered the most. A small temple outside the West Gate was damaged by the bombing. Someone wrote in front of a stern-faced Buddha statue in the open air: "What kind of evil × slaves! How dare you commit such atrocities! May Heaven allow retribution, and may you deserve to die!" However, there is another heartening phenomenon related to the people's food supply: when I first arrived in Xiangyang, I saw citizens carrying bags and crowding to buy salt. But in no time, this salt shortage problem was readily solved. Xiangfan had a large reserve of salt, but due to manipulation by unscrupulous merchants and the failure of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office to prevent it beforehand or actively remedy it afterward, the unscrupulous merchants transported the salt stored in the city to the countryside to reap high prices. Fortunately, the Garrison Headquarters prohibited the transport of salt out of the city, and the Commander's Office sent a large number of wooden boats from the Shashi area to transport salt to Xiangyang, so that the citizens were not in danger of having bland food.

From Xiangfan, one can go northwest to Laohekou, and from Laohekou north via Nanyang to Luoyang, and west out of Jingziguan to Xijing. There are merchant vehicles available for transportation, which is relatively convenient. The transportation center of Henan Province has now shifted to the western part of Henan. Based on this, it can be predicted that if the Japanese do not succeed in Zhengzhou, they will definitely not dare to encroach on Xiangfan. But if the Japanese do not gain some strongholds in the Xiang River basin, they will not dare to take rash action against Zhengzhou. However, Xiangfan, Zhengzhou, Nanyang, Luoyang, and Jingziguan are all mutually interconnected northwest national defense strongholds. All these fortified cities have already been building up strength. In the future, they will undoubtedly become a new Taierzhuang where the Japanese army will be annihilated en masse.

Laohekou is located at the strategic intersection of Hubei, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces. It is a transit port for the upper and lower reaches of the Han River, and also a distribution center for products from the border areas of the three provinces. Although it is in an extraordinary period, commerce is still very developed. Especially around eight or nine o'clock at night, the city is brightly lit, and people come and go like weaving shuttles. It is truly a prosperous city rarely seen in the interior; although this is a distorted result of daytime air raids.

Laohekou was originally a small town in Guanghua County, just like the relationship between Shashi and Jingzhou. Although administrative power is still in the hands of the county, the population, commerce, and economic center have all shifted to the convenient small town. Over time, the vassal has become a great power. Thus, Laohekou and Shashi have today's prosperous scene. At the same time, the police have also directly belonged to the provincial government.

On a street tour, I saw the station bringing in two prisoners from the front lines: one was a pitiful Shandong compatriot, driven to the front lines by the Japanese to be cannon fodder. His nerves were already deranged, and he only knew how to curse "Han Fuqu, the traitor." The other was a rather stubborn Japanese. He would kick the audience like a wild horse with his hooves. He would babble and roar, attracting the audience to surround him as if watching a monkey show. Later, someone tried to talk to him, but he only wrote a few squiggly characters, saying that he was a "Japanese Concession" person named "Meishenghan," "Adoptive parents - Wang Ming," and "Down with Japanese imperialism." When he wrote "Down with Japanese imperialism," according to the person who brought him, he always paid attention to the viewers when he passed places with powerful words. When someone asked him, he would write out a few incomplete lines. The implication is that he is speculating on China and is not sincerely enlightened—but that is not necessarily the case. When they got up, he kindly handed a piece of leftover pancake to a child, but the child didn't want it. A woman with bound feet hobbled over to see him. An acquaintance pointed to the newly bought bakelite bowl in her hand and joked: "This is the enemy goods they made!" She didn't even glance at the Japanese and turned around with shame, seemingly going to the seller to argue.

Going five or six li north out of the North Gate of Laohekou, one arrives at the county town of Guanghua. About four or five li west of Wangyao Road, among the willows and woods, are several tile-roofed houses, said to be the "Hometown of Zhou Wuzi Xu." There is still a stele beside the road as a memorial. This area is garrisoned by the heroic soldiers who fired the first shot at Lugou Bridge. They have a small rule that when taking rickshaws in and out of the city gates, they must get out of the rickshaw and walk; otherwise, the rickshaw pullers will be scolded by the guards. Some people find it troublesome and often protest. In fact, asking them to get out of the rickshaw is probably for easy inspection. It is not comparable to the Japanese forcing our compatriots in the occupied areas to take off their hats.

The streets in Tonghua Town are very straight, but the population is sparse, making one feel calm. Last winter, it was bombed twice by enemy planes, resulting in more than twenty casualties. Laohekou was also often bombed by enemy planes before, but since the international spy case involving an Italian missionary was cracked, although alarm bells have been frequently ringing, it has not suffered any more tragic bombings.

The cracking of this international spy case was a great effort on the part of the parties involved. According to my friend, Battalion Commander Zhou Dewei of the XX team, when the war broke out in Jiujiang, he foresaw that someone here was providing information to the Japanese via radio. Once, General Zhu De passed through here and stayed at a certain hotel for less than four hours. Enemy planes immediately bombed the hotel. Although it was determined that the Italian missionary in the Catholic Church was the spy, military police were inconvenient to enter the church to collect evidence due to extraterritorial rights.

Later, a certain Li, who was looked down upon as an idler, was motivated by patriotism and volunteered to help solve the case. He first got to know two workers in the church, slept with them, and got up in the middle of the night to offer sacrifices several times, but still did not find any trace of the radio. However, he found some clues in the workers' conversations.

The police bureau was eager to solve the case and arrested the two workers for interrogation. Not only did they fail to get any confessions, but they also risked causing a diplomatic dispute. Thereupon, Li offered a "bitter meat" ruse, asking to be arrested and interrogated along with the two workers on suspicion. They were detained and comforted each other. Li then learned that the Italian missionary was indeed an international spy who was secretly providing information to the Japanese via radio. The military police followed the clues and found the radio in a concealed location during an interrogation, thus clarifying the case.

Those two Italian spy missionaries were truly cunning. On one hand, they confessed and apologized to the military and civilians of Laohekou. On the other hand, they telegraphed our government, requesting leniency and asking that they not be deported, considering the many years of charitable work they had done in Laohekou. They have now moved from the church to Shengjia Keng and are under surveillance by our military police.

Such a lenient disposition is too cheap for them: because the charitable work they usually do is precisely used as a cover for their espionage work.

However, that Mr. Li, who was looked down upon by others, did not hesitate to endure physical hardship and assisted the police force, achieving great success in solving the case. This is indeed worthy of admiration and emulation, and it is necessary to eliminate spy traitor organizations everywhere!

### The Four Powers Will Issue a Declaration Against German Aggression - Principles Agreed Upon, Methods Under Discussion - The US Prepares to Express Its Attitude Separately

[Reuters, London, 21st] Foreign affairs observers here write that the declaration of unity among the four powers against further German aggression, initiated by Britain, will be broadly worded. It is reported that the declaration will not specify any concrete constraints, nor will it make any definite provisions. The original draft of the declaration is currently under consideration by the governments of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland. However, no formal announcement is expected until tomorrow or Sunday. The Soviet Union and Poland hope that the declaration will specify the actions to be taken by the signatory countries, but British officials are eager to issue the declaration without including provisions for military action and international conferences for the time being. People here believe that it would be inconvenient to convene international conferences in this time of crisis. If a conference were held in Rome as suggested by the Soviet Union, discussions on various treaties and obligations would inevitably be time-consuming. People here emphasize that they are consulting with the Soviet Union regarding the drafting of the declaration, and there is no disagreement between them. In general, the principles are not in question. What is being discussed is the method. Everyone is paying close attention to Italy's attitude. Mussolini will deliver a speech next Sunday, at which time he will state Italy's position. The departure of the Italian ambassador to Germany from Berlin and his return to Italy has aroused commentary in diplomatic circles, like rumors of a Franco-Italian rapprochement (the Franco-Italian rapprochement has been denied). Today, the Polish and Turkish ambassadors to Britain visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax. French Foreign Minister Bonnet has accompanied the French President to Britain. He will meet with the British Foreign Secretary tomorrow to discuss the specific details of the unity declaration. Romanian Ambassador to Britain Tilea visited the Foreign Office today and is scheduled to return to Romania tomorrow.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 21st] British Ambassador to Poland Kennard visited the Polish Foreign Office today. It is widely believed that he has notified Colonel Beck of the British proposed diplomatic plan and sought his opinion. People here believe that Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, has long pursued a policy of not joining any group, and does not want to change it or be bound by any constraints. Beck will go to London on April 3, at which time there will be a thorough discussion of Poland's attitude. Currently, Beck is unlikely to participate in the British plan. People here point out that Poland has a treaty of alliance with France and also has a treaty with Romania.

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] President Roosevelt announced at a meeting with reporters today that he was quite displeased with the current situation, but declined to criticize developments in Central Europe. He said that reports that he had suggested a unified economic sanctions against Germany were unfounded.

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] According to reliable sources, if a declaration against aggression has been signed by various European countries, the U.S. government will also issue a similar declaration.

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles declared today that no government had sent any notes to the U.S. government regarding the situation in Central Europe, and the U.S. government had not exchanged views with any government.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] It is rumored that relevant parties here will send several unofficial envoys to Italy to undertake special missions. It is said that the candidate is former Prime Minister Laval, who previously represented the French side in negotiations with Mussolini on North African trade agreement issues. However, Laval has categorically denied this. It is widely believed that if there is such a decision on the part of the National Relations Committee, it must be implemented immediately, as Mussolini is scheduled to deliver a speech tomorrow this week.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st] The Italian ambassador to Germany has returned to Rome to report on the international situation to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The news of the Italian ambassador's departure from Germany was not announced in advance, and the newspapers have not yet revealed it.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st] Italian Ambassador Attolico visited Hitler yesterday and met with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Air Force Minister General Goering. He returned to his post today. General Goering is also continuing his vacation in San Remo, Italy.

[Reuters, Moscow, 21st] The official TASS news agency has formally denied that the Soviet government had promised Poland and Romania to provide assistance if the two countries were invaded by other countries. It also said that the two countries had not requested assistance or notified the Soviet government of any threatened danger. On March 18, the British government notified the Soviet side, pointing out that Romania was likely to be subjected to violence at any time, and inquired about what attitude the Soviet Union would take if such a situation occurred. When responding, the Soviet side proposed convening a conference of countries with close interests, namely, Britain, France, Poland, Romania, Turkey, and the Soviet Union. However, the British side believed that this suggestion was not yet ripe.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd] Japanese newspapers say that in view of the development of the situation in Europe, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will have to change their Far Eastern policy. "Miyako Shimbun" claims that Japan must pay serious attention to the development of the situation in the future, because the anti-German axis of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has been strengthened, and Europe is already in serious danger.

[Haitong Agency, Melbourne, 22nd] Australian Prime Minister Lyons announced yesterday that the Australian Cabinet had decided in a special meeting to fully assist the British government, maintain world peace, and protect the freedom and independence of invaded countries.

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] Romanian Envoy Tilea will return to his country tomorrow after holding talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax today.

### Lithuania also Succumbs Under Military Threat - Memel Region of Lithuania Ceded to Germany - Hitler Will Travel With the Army

[Reuters, Lithuanian Capital, 22nd] The Lithuanian government has now agreed in principle to Germany's unconditional demand that the Memel territory be incorporated into Germany. The Lithuanian parliament will meet today to ratify this decision. It is understood that Germany's demand is subject to a 48-hour time limit.

[Reuters, London, 21st] According to unofficial reports, the Lithuanian government has decided to accept Germany's demands and immediately return Memel to Germany. Today, Lithuanians and Jews in Memel are fleeing en masse.

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The Memel territory was handed over to Germany last night. People here were shocked when they heard the news this morning. The official will not issue a statement to foreign countries. A government spokesman told a Reuters reporter: "Germany has supreme power in Memel, which no one can deny." It is understood that Hitler will probably accompany the German army into Memel, and the navy will also participate in the celebration. Political figures believe that Hitler will take this opportunity to deliver an important speech to respond to foreign criticism. A German newspaper said: "The democratic countries have tasted a serious lesson again."

[Reuters, Memel, 22nd] The Germans in Memel are now celebrating their return to Germany. Stormtroopers are parading and demonstrating, and women are dancing and singing on the streets. At the same time, Lithuanians are extremely saddened by the abandonment of Memel. This morning, after the Germans took over the post office, telegraph office, and government agencies, the last link between Memel and Lithuania was broken. A large number of Germans are crossing the border into Memel. An official from the Berlin Propaganda Department declared that German troops had not yet entered Memel and would only be sent to occupy it after the Lithuanian envoy arrived in Berlin.

[Reuters, Memel, 21st] Lithuanian Governor of Memel, Gris, confirmed today that Germany had issued an ultimatum to Lithuania demanding the cession of the Memel territory to Germany. Lithuania is currently considering a reply and is expected to reply on Tuesday.

[Reuters, Memel, 22nd] After confirming that Germany had demanded the cession of Memel to Lithuania, Lithuanian Governor of Memel Gris said that Germany had also told Lithuania that if Lithuania caused disturbances, German troops would enter to maintain order.

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] A report from Comas says that Germany has sent a note to the Lithuanian Foreign Minister demanding that Memel be ceded within five days. It is said that if Lithuania does not comply with the demands in the note, the German troops concentrated along the border will immediately enter Lithuania. However, if it complies with its demands, Lithuania can be given border protection and the right to use the port.

[Reuters, Memel, 21st] Memel Nationalist Party leader Neumann told a Reuters interviewer today that he hoped that Lithuania would "cede the Memel territory as soon as possible."

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] Today, newspapers here expressed shock at Hitler's actions in Lithuania. "The Globe" said, "Germany's occupation of Memel is sufficient to prove that without the establishment of a strong gathering of peaceful countries, there can be no resistance. Germany does not hesitate to attack small and weak countries, but the situation changes in an instant, and we must pay attention to not missing the opportunity."

[Reuters, Comas, 22nd] A communiqué issued here said that "Germany has promised Lithuania's economic interests in the port of Memel. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has specifically pointed out to the Lithuanian Foreign Minister that, according to news from Memel, this issue should be resolved quickly in accordance with Germany's suggestions to avoid conflict." It is heard that the German government has agreed to maintain friendly treaty relations with Lithuania.

### New Neutrality Act - US House of Representatives May Pass It

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] A Reuters Congressional correspondent learned that the attitude of the House of Representatives on the amendment to the Neutrality Act proposed by Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, will depend on the actions of the Senate. If it is passed by the Senate, the House of Representatives will also pass it. Pro-government figures believe that although Senators Borah, Nye, etc., are firmly opposed, a majority can still be passed, and the deliberate picking of minor points by a small number of people in public opinion is not a cause for concern.

### London County Council - 50th Anniversary - Queen Mary and Others Attend the Celebration

[Reuters, London, 21st] Undersecretary of State Butler replied in the House of Commons today, "To my knowledge, Germany's occupation of Bohemia and Moravia has not resulted in any loss in terms of military strength." A member of parliament asked, "Is it true that Germany now has newly added first-class superior reserves, including 700 excellent aircraft, and there is a new Skoda armory that can continuously supply military supplies?" The Undersecretary replied, "This is difficult to answer." Sir Cooper Howard said, "The caliber of Czech heavy artillery and rifles is different from that of Germany. The benefits Germany obtains from acquiring these guns are not as great as people think."

[Haitong Agency, Paris, 22nd] Yesterday, "Paris Soir" claimed that the French government, following the example of the British and American governments, ordered banks to stop paying out deposits of Czech expatriates. Financial circles believe that this step will have a great impact on Czechs residing in France who attempt to switch to German nationality.

Because the negotiations have been protracted, there are widespread rumors that difficulties have arisen between the two sides.

### Six Thousand Pounds - British Government Subsidizes Reuters - Labor Party Members Launch Debate

[Reuters, London, 21st] During today's parliamentary debate, the issue of the government granting six thousand pounds to Reuters last year during the European crisis was raised. This money was used to increase Reuters' delivery of news to foreign countries at that time. Labor MP Philip said, "I do not want to attack Reuters' commercial principles and integrity. I have no bias in my suggestions about Reuters. However, I want to know if the parliament approved six thousand pounds for Reuters to send more news, whether it was about speeches and criticisms favorable to the government or criticisms of the government's foreign policy. Whether the newspapers of the dominions have disclosed this news. Communication agencies in South America and the United States do not trust Reuters because Reuters is subsidized by the government." Another Labor MP Baker said, "Considering Reuters' annual expenses, six thousand pounds is a small amount, but it may be unfavorable abroad because Reuters will be considered to be under the influence of the government." Undersecretary of State Butler said, "The British government's assistance to Reuters is purely a special emergency measure, the purpose of which is to publish more British news."

### Damascus: Situation Remains Tense; Many Rioters Arrested

Brief Commentary

### Terrifying "Increase" and "Development"

"Increase" and "development" are usually good terms, but today's local news contains frightening news about "increase" and "development":

The first piece of news is about the increase in Japanese goods imports. The statistics for last month show a large increase compared to the same month last year. When we think about it, more than nine-tenths of Hong Kong residents are Chinese. Isn't this news of increased Japanese goods imports a ruthless and terrible insult to us? Although this insult doesn't affect the vast majority of overseas Chinese and is the responsibility of a few unscrupulous merchants, shouldn't we look at the fervent movements to boycott Japanese goods in Britain, the United States, and India?

The second piece of news is the sudden development of Hong Kong's entertainment industry during the war of resistance. Of course, the biggest contributors to this development are our wealthy and pleasure-seeking upper-class refugees! However, being a contributor to Hong Kong's entertainment industry inevitably means being an unfilial descendant of the Chinese motherland! We don't hope that everyone will give up entertainment, but to promote the entertainment industry during the war of resistance cannot be considered anything other than terrible news. May those who have the money to enjoy entertainment also think about the motherland under fire and the suffering compatriots!

### Respectable 370 Million

Indian pastor Montulu recently arrived in Hong Kong and stated that 370 million Indian people are willing to be the support behind the Chinese nation's war of resistance against Japan. He also said that all religions in India are united in boycotting Japanese goods, and shops are voluntarily stopping their procurement.

China's resistance is not only seeking its own national independence, freedom, and happiness but also resisting the common aggressor to defend world peace and justice. The interests of the Indian people are completely aligned with ours. The two great ancient civilizations of China and India should hold hands closely today to jointly resist these vermin of human civilization. Under the leadership of their wise and progressive leader, Mr. Nehru, the Indian people are faithfully implementing a united national front, fighting for liberation by opposing fascism and aggression. We should offer the highest national respect to the brave leaders and 370 million comrades-in-arms of India and wish the two great civilized and advanced nations a future of great victory.

### Zeng Zhongming Dies for the Cause of ×

An Associated Press report states that several patriots unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate Wang Jingwei in Hanoi, and Wang's personal secretary, Zeng Zhongming, was wounded and died on the 21st. Zeng loyally followed Wang Jingwei for many years... Zeng also privately abandoned his important central post to follow Wang. Now he has died for Wang, which can be truly called "dying for the cause of ×." Now some people say that Zeng "died for the country," as if Zeng's death occurred while serving the country, to cover up the fact that he privately abandoned his post to follow a traitor. What is the intention behind this? How can it be heard?

### Japanese Residents in Singapore Certainly Engaged in Espionage; Britain Has Responded to Japanese Protest; Searches Conducted According to Law

[Central News Agency, London, 22nd] The Japanese government previously protested to the British government on January 28th regarding the search of Japanese residents' homes and the arrest of several Japanese residents suspected of espionage by the British authorities in Singapore. The British side has now responded, stating that the search conducted by the British authorities in Singapore was carried out in accordance with the law and that the police investigation has proven that some Japanese residents in Singapore are engaged in activities harmful to Singapore. The defensive measures taken by the British authorities in Singapore are exactly the same in meaning as the defensive measures taken by the Japanese government in the Sixth Garrison District. The position of Singapore is similar to the position of Japan. Several instances have been found of Japanese residents engaging in espionage work. The British government hopes that Japanese residents in Singapore will abide by their obligations as residents so that the British authorities will not need to take further measures.

### Germany Intensifies Construction of Western Defenses; Rumors of Inciting Hungary to Invade Romania; Preparations Completed Near Romanian Capital

[Reuters, Metz, France, 21st] According to sources here, Germany is intensifying the strengthening of its western border defenses. Workers are rushing to build fortifications day and night under the direction of engineers, many of whom arrived on Saturday night. Tank traps are being built half a mile from the French border. It is said that once these tank "graves" are completed, the Germans will immediately build military huts to camouflage them. German guards, armed to the teeth, are on strict alert.

[Reuters, Budapest, 22nd] Although Hungary has not officially announced mobilization, officials do not deny that several thousand people have already been ordered to enlist. What is seen here indicates that military steps will continue.

[Associated Press, London, 22nd] According to the London "Times" correspondent in Budapest this morning, it is confirmed that Hungarian troops are indeed mobilizing. The exact number is difficult to ascertain, but it is believed to be very large. This mobilization is entirely directed against Romania. Although the Hungarian envoy in Paris denied this yesterday, the Hungarian government issued an official gazette in Budapest confirming that it had ordered partial mobilization. The official gazette stated that because Romania was concentrating heavy troops on the Hungarian border, the Hungarian government had no choice but to take this measure as a routine response to the threat. Troops from both countries are currently facing each other on the border, but there are no signs of a serious escalation.

[Central News Agency, Bucharest, 21st] People in political circles here are quite uneasy about Germany's attitude after Hungary occupied Ruthenia. It is said that Germany may incite Hungary to attack Romania to recover Transylvania Province.

[Central News Agency, Bucharest, 21st] The State Council recently issued a public announcement stating that military measures have been taken in the vicinity of Bucharest. The investigation of residents who have military service obligations has been completed to allow them to be called up when necessary.

[Reuters, Bucharest, 21st] An official announcement here today stated that the Romanian government, in accordance with a cabinet decision, has concentrated several divisions of reserves. If necessary, they will be sent to the border to reinforce defenses. If Romania adopts a peaceful policy, these reserves will not go to the border but will be trained. Once the neighboring countries demobilize, these reserves will be dismissed. It also said that large armies have not been concentrated on the border. The existing troops are only engaged in exercises.

### Our Currency System is Stable; British Parliamentarians Unanimously Support Aid to China; Japan's Plans Will Inevitably Fail

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] Yesterday in the Lower House, Finance Minister Simon proposed a second reading of the bill to increase the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund, stating that although British trade with China accounts for only a small percentage of Britain's total foreign trade, it still has the value of being maintained and further assisted. Furthermore, China has a large population, and even a slight increase in the purchasing power of each individual would make a significant difference. The outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict was an extremely serious test for the currency system adopted in 1935. The various technical methods adopted by China are extremely complete. At the same time, overseas Chinese citizens are also actively remitting huge sums back to their motherland or enthusiastically purchasing various wartime bonds to consolidate their domestic currency system. In the past year, China's currency system has been complete and orderly, without any disturbance, and its credit has remained unshakable. If the Lower House can support the government's proposed bill, then I solemnly guarantee to you that the Chinese people will be able to maintain their past high praise. Labor Party member Lawrence rose to speak, saying that this bill can promote British trade, and what is particularly noteworthy is that this bill can provide China with practical assistance to resist Japan. Therefore, this seat expresses extreme support for the government's bill. Liberal Party member Mond also supported the government's bill, saying that until today, the government should consider what other actions to take to enhance China's position and stop Japanese aggression. The government's handling of this matter in the past, with a narrow perspective, is truly regrettable. We must make more efforts to allow British goods to be freely exported to any corner of the world. The government's introduction of this bill is indeed one of the implementation of various resolutions of the League of Nations. Conservative Party member Boothby said that perhaps this way of assisting China is too late, and the amount is not sufficient. This is the only thing I regret. Labor Party member Smith proposed a counter-proposal, saying that if the government does not adopt a new political and economic policy towards the Far East, it will be impossible to stop the instability of British trade. In the past, the government, in order not to offend Japan, failed to take the lead from a humanitarian standpoint to assist China. For eight years, the government has always adhered to its consistent policy, namely, sacrificing the invaded country in order to negotiate with the aggressor. Labor Party member Tinker supported Smith's counter-proposal, declaring that what the government is now proposing is the result of our failure to firmly stand our ground when Japan invaded China in the past. Parliamentarian Astor said, I hope that the original proposer of the amendment does not need to be so aggressive in his claims. If the Lower House can pass this bill, then China, both in government and in the private sector, will definitely feel satisfied. Therefore, the Lower House should unanimously pass the bill. Labor Party member Burke (Lancashire parliamentarian) said that if the government can find a way to maintain the British cotton trade market, the cotton merchants in this county will be extremely grateful. Regardless of how long the current war extends, Britain's real competition will begin after the end of the war. If the original proposer of the amendment insists on his claim, then I will vote in favor of the government's bill. Labor Party member Brenger said that if the purpose of this bill is to promote Sino-British trade relations, then this seat will express support. The purpose of this bill should be guaranteed by Finance Minister Simon. As for whether or not to imitate the precedent of the Triple Entente and cooperate fully with the United States and France when implementing this bill, Simon replied that other governments have financially assisted China in various ways in the past. For example, the United States has purchased large quantities of silver. As for this bill, I would like to ask the Lower House to regard it as a form of British assistance to China. The Finance Department representative Wallace replied on behalf of the government, saying that all parliamentarians from the opposition party admit that the amount of ten million pounds is sufficient to achieve the purpose of this bill. At the same time, during the debate in the Lower House, all parties also admitted that China's currency system is currently not showing any signs of wavering and has indeed been able to maintain its stability in the past. Domestic support for it in China is consistent, and the situation is extremely good. As for the reason for designating four Chinese banks to participate in the management of this fund, it is because each bank has particularly rich experience in this matter, and their locations are suitable in various places related to this case. Therefore, entrusting the responsibility of managing this huge sum to the four banks will definitely be successful and pleasant. As for what actions the government should have taken in the past to assist China, or what actions it should take, in short, this bill will definitely be of great help to China. This is undoubtedly the case. Therefore, the government sincerely hopes that the Lower House can unanimously express support, because the passage of this bill will definitely have a huge psychological impact on China. Regarding the Japanese side's currency system plan in North China and the British side's protest about this, Wallace said that according to expert commentary, many believe that the overall result of this Japanese plan will inevitably fail. This is what we can be greatly pleased about. If the Japanese side attempts to change the exchange rate of one Japanese yen for eight and a half pence to one yen for fourteen pence, then the impact will be that all export trade will inevitably stop immediately. Therefore, based on the current situation, China's legal tender will generally continue to circulate in all places, except for large cities and places along railways under Japanese military control. Wallace continued that Hong Kong has been designated as the place for the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund to be used. The fund of ten million pounds will be shared immediately by the Chinese and British banks according to their shares. The current fund of ten million pounds will be held in Britain before it is used. The interest earned can be used by the Chinese bank to repay the British bank. The interest rate of the fund is temporarily set at 2.75%. If the two parties renew the agreement after one year, the interest can be appropriately increased or decreased. The reason why the bill does not specify the maximum interest rate is to ensure the possibility that the Sino-British agreement may continue to be in effect for several years. The government does not want to repeatedly submit a request to the Lower House for approval.

Looking at the trading countries, there were significant decreases in trade with Britain, Burma, South Africa, and the United States. The decrease in trade with South China was particularly severe, with exports decreasing by more than 90 percent. However, there was a considerable increase in trade with Guangzhou Bay. Although exports to Japan decreased, imports showed a considerable increase. The import value last month was 1,549,368 Hong Kong dollars, while in the same month last year, it was 1,423,677 Hong Kong dollars.

Merchants Seek Profit; ×××××

Furthermore, the local weaving industry is flourishing, with products such as singlets, socks, and vests selling well in Southeast Asia, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Borneo. Overseas orders are increasing daily, and many newly established electric weaving factories have been established, numbering no less than two hundred. All have obtained substantial profits, and the number of people engaged in this work exceeds ten thousand. Among them, women are particularly numerous, accounting for more than 80 percent of the total number of workers. An investigation reveals that the weaving industry in Hong Kong uses three types of yarn: one is Shanghai's domestic yarn (this type of yarn is produced by Shanghai's Wing On Company. Since Shanghai fell, Hong Kong manufacturers have no longer been able to use it), the second is British Indian (Bombay) yarn, and the third is ×-produced × yarn. The latter two are commonly used by Hong Kong weaving manufacturers today. In the past two years, the Hong Kong Weaving Industry Association ××××××××, has convened numerous meetings to discuss and all agreed to use British Indian (Bombay) yarn as the raw material, and established regulations to encourage each other. At that time, there were also special tax benefits for products made with Bombay yarn. Since the implementation of the regulations, many Hong Kong weaving manufacturers have been happy to comply, resulting in purely British yarn-made products. Unexpectedly, less than two years later, some merchants, taking advantage of the overseas and local Chinese compatriots' patriotic fervor, using local cloth, have been falsely claiming their products as Hong Kong products...

Japanese Yarn Shipments to Hong Kong Reached 6 Million Annually

According to unofficial statistics, last year's shipments of × yarn to Hong Kong reached approximately 6 million Hong Kong dollars. The formal weaving of products with Bombay yarn accounted for less than one-third. Later, the investigators discovered ××××××, therefore, the export situation of domestic products this spring has plummeted. The order count is only within one million Hong Kong dollars. According to officials from the industry association, the reason why × yarn can be massively sold in Hong Kong, despite the specially preferential and guaranteed Bombay yarn, still cannot compete with it, is because firstly, the yarn quality is not as smooth and fine as × yarn, and secondly, the cost is higher. It is hoped that the Hong Kong tax authorities and the Imports and Exports Department will give this matter careful consideration so that Bombay yarn can regain its market. It is also hoped that Hong Kong weaving manufacturers can be willing to purchase and use friendly raw materials.

### US Far East Fleet Commander Admiral Yarnell to Visit Hong Kong Next Month; Large Number of US Warships Also Coming to Hong Kong in Stages

US Far East Fleet Commander Admiral Yarnell will visit Hong Kong on the flagship USS Augusta at the end of next month. Many other US warships will also be coming to Hong Kong in the near future. The schedule for the US warships' visit to Hong Kong is as follows: USS Barker, March 26 to April 23; USS Whipple, April 3 to 6; USS Pollux, April 26; USS Ashevill, April 7 to 17; USS Tulsa, April 7 to 13; USS Stoddert, April 22 to May 1; USS Stone, April 9 to 11; USS Augusta, USS Canopus, USS Pigeon, and submarines S-36 and S-38, May 12 to 16; USS Gold Star and USS Chaumont, early May.

Since the fall of Shanghai, the escort business in Hong Kong has been exceptionally prosperous. The establishment of escort agencies has sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Because the escorts in each agency are mixed and uneven in quality, and because some degenerates use the name of escort to engage in prostitution, the traces have been revealed and the facts have become clear.

### The Hong Kong Government is Considering the Issue of the Existence and Abolition of Escort Agencies

In the Future, Those Who Engage in Prostitution Under the Guise of Escorts Will Be Resolutely Cracking Down

Social morals have been greatly affected, and people from all walks of life have been criticizing this. Gradually, it has aroused the attention of the Hong Kong government authorities. Recently, all the escort agencies in Hong Kong held a meeting to form an association to try to purify themselves and survive. It was resolved to submit a case to the government, requesting approval for establishment. At present, people from all walks of life in society are paying attention to the issue of the survival of escort agencies. The reporter once asked Mr. Cally, the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, about this matter. According to him, the escort agency submitted an application to this department for registration, but the government has not yet made any decision on this matter, and this department has not expressed any opinion on the current situation of escort agencies. According to what the reporter knows, the Hong Kong government is indeed paying close attention to the increasing number of escort agencies being established. The government has also received reports from various parties regarding the escort agencies' transgressions. It is currently considering cracking down on them. According to general speculation, even if the government does not completely abolish the escort agencies in the future, it will definitely formulate strict regulations to make the escort agencies abide by them in order to maintain social morals and order.

### The Verdict on the Shooting of Lin Baisheng: Chen Xilin Sentenced to Fifteen Years in Prison; Witnesses Testified that Chen Was the Assailant, Lin Also Testified in Court; Chen Vigorously Denied Guilt, Resulting in Conviction for Assault

Lin Baisheng, the manager of the Hong Kong South China Daily, who published a pro-peace telegram on behalf of Wang Jingwei, was suddenly attacked at around 5 p.m. on the 17th of January this year in front of the McIntosh Company on Des Voeux Road, sustaining multiple head injuries. Afterwards, the suspect, Chen Xilin, was apprehended by British military medics. The police immediately collected evidence and charged him with (1) assaulting Lin Baisheng in Des Voeux Road on January 17, with intent to murder, and (2) assaulting Lin Baisheng with intent to inflict bodily harm, totaling two counts. The injured party, Lin Baisheng, suffered relatively minor injuries and, after being sent to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment, was not in serious condition. During the central trial, Lin had already taken the stand to testify. After the magistrate, Mr. Edwards, recorded his testimony, the case was transferred to the High Court for sentencing. Details were reported previously. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30, Justice McKillop convened a jury of seven members: E. Zhen Gao (foreman), Bai Li Jia Shi, Cai Hu Zhong, Chen Liu Chou, Huang Ning Guang, and A. Lie Bao Lu Fu, for deliberation. Government barristers Bao Lian Di Shi and Shao Liao Ya Li Ma Da prosecuted, and the defendant did not retain a lawyer. The plaintiff, Lin Baisheng, retained lawyer Shi Lu Hua to observe the proceedings. Lin Baisheng wore a blue cotton robe, carried a walking stick, and appeared in good spirits, but his right eye had not yet healed and was covered with an eye patch. The defendant, Chen Xilin, wore the same brownish-yellow flight shirt and gray cloth trousers as he had in the preliminary court.

The Prosecuting Attorney Outlines the Case

After the trial began, barrister Shao Liao Ya Li Ma Da outlined the case, stating that on the afternoon of January 17 this year, at around 5 p.m., Lin Baisheng, manager of the South China Daily, walked down from the Zhongtian Building and proceeded west along the sidewalk. Upon reaching the McIntosh Company, he turned onto the main road. Lin had forgotten whether he was on the sidewalk or the side of the road, but after only a few steps, he suddenly felt several blows to his head and immediately fell to the ground unconscious. Fortunately, Lin was wearing a felt hat, which absorbed much of the impact. At this time, Dr. Hua happened to be walking out of Lane Crawford, heading towards his car, when he suddenly heard a commotion in the street. He saw a Chinese man running west and another man standing next to Lin, striking him three times in the back of the head with an iron cone before discarding the weapon and fleeing. At the same time, a Westerner named Luo Bian Shen rushed forward to give chase. The man ran across the tram tracks, between the Gloucester Hotel and Lane Crawford, where Luo Bian Shen finally caught up with him. A military medic, Xia Shi, heard the commotion and rushed to intercept him, bringing him back to the scene of the incident for police investigation. Dr. Hua, amidst the confusion, returned to Lane Crawford and called the police station and ambulance. Shortly afterwards, Dr. Hua returned to the scene and saw the plaintiff lying in a pool of blood. An iron hammer was found about three feet away from him, and an iron bar was found a foot away from the tram tracks. British Constable He Jin Shi arrived after hearing the report, and Xia Shi identified the man as the one who had struck the plaintiff with a hammer. The ambulance then arrived and took the injured party to the hospital for treatment. At the same time, police detectives handed over the recovered iron bar and iron strip to Constable Yun Di for filing. At this time, the police still did not know the name of the injured party and only learned it later. When the defendant was charged, his statement was merely, "I have nothing to say." The plaintiff's right eye is still affected and requires ongoing treatment.

The Plaintiff Recounts the Attack

After Luo Fu Shi testified about his experience photographing the scene, Dr. Ge Ni from Queen Mary Hospital took the stand. He testified that Lin Baisheng was admitted to the hospital at about 6 p.m. on January 17 this year and was treated by him. He saw a one-and-a-half-inch-long wound on his right eyebrow, extending downward, and the eyelid was bruised and black. An X-ray revealed that his eye socket was fractured, and there were also wounds on his forehead and three semi-circular wounds on the back of his head. Lin was slightly conscious when admitted to the hospital and remained hospitalized until February 16, when he was discharged. However, his right eye has not yet healed. The injured party sustained a total of eight head injuries. His brain was not injured because the felt hat presented in court provided considerable protection. Then, the plaintiff Lin Baisheng took the stand, stating that he was the founder and manager of the South China Daily at 49 Hollywood Road. On the afternoon of January 17 this year, at 5 p.m., he walked down from the Zhongtian Building to return to the South China Daily. As he stepped out of the arcade, he suddenly felt someone attacking him from the side and behind. After taking two steps, he collapsed to the ground. He did not know what happened afterwards but faintly heard a Western woman shouting "ambulance." The felt hat presented in court was the one he was wearing on the day of the incident. It had just been dry-cleaned and was in excellent condition. His right eye is now different, and he did not previously know the attacker.

Dr. Hua Testifies that Chen Was the Assailant

Following this, Dr. Hua took the stand, stating that he was a doctor at Queen Mary Hospital. On the afternoon of January 17, he left Lane Crawford and was about to get into his car when he heard a commotion. He looked up and saw the defendant striking a Chinese man who had fallen to the ground three times on the head with an iron hammer. The defendant then discarded the hammer and fled. He immediately returned to Lane Crawford and informed the police station by telephone. Then, witness Luo Bian Shen took the stand, stating that on that day he was passing in front of the Gloucester Building when he suddenly saw a Chinese man fall to the ground. Another Chinese man (the defendant) was holding an iron hammer high above his shoulder, striking him three times on the head. He shouted, "Stop that man!" and ran after the defendant. Another person then intercepted the defendant and brought him back to the scene. Another person then picked up an iron hammer and an iron bar and placed them beside the injured party. There were no pedestrians or vehicles passing on the road that day. He positively identified the defendant as the one who committed the assault, as he had never taken his eyes off the defendant that day. After his testimony, British military medic Xia Shi, who apprehended the defendant that day, testified that at about 5 p.m. on that afternoon, he and a companion were walking west on Des Voeux Road near Lane Crawford when they suddenly heard a shout of "Stop that man." He turned around and saw a Chinese man lying on the road opposite them, and another man running west. He soon lost sight of him, but then saw another man running towards him from the location where the man was lying on the ground. He and his companion intercepted him. This man was the defendant present in court. Luo Bian Shen then arrived and, together, they brought him to the scene of the incident. Someone else handed an iron hammer to him, and he handed it over to Constable He Jin Shi. At this point, the judge asked the defendant if he needed Xia Shi's companions, William and John, to testify. The defendant said no. The judge then continued with the testimony of Constable He Jin Shi, who stated that he was at Watson's pharmacy on the third floor when he received a report and rushed to the scene. He saw a Chinese man lying on the road, with several people attending to him. He then took the defendant and witnesses back to the police station and handed them over to Constable Wen Shi for investigation. The injured party was sent to the hospital by ambulance.

The Defendant Denies the Assault

Then, Constable Wen Shi testified, stating that at about 5 p.m. that afternoon, he was in the detective department when Constable He Jin Shi handed over the defendant and the witnesses to him. He asked who the injured party was, and everyone said they did not know. The defendant then told him that the injured party was Lin Baisheng. Then, police interpreter Tan Bo Xi testified about explaining the charges to the defendant and filing the case. Then, the defendant testified in the defendant's box, stating that he had five people, Lin Jiu, Mai Ming, Bo Bing, Chen Hou, and Mai Cong, who could prove his innocence, but only Lin Jiu was present in court. The witnesses for the plaintiff said that he was the one who attacked the plaintiff, but he denied it. At 4:50 p.m. that afternoon, he finished his work at the Murray Barracks and walked out, passing by the Zhongtian Building. He saw a crowd of people watching something and, thinking there was an accident, he went over to watch as well. He saw the injured party lying on the ground. Not knowing what was going on, he continued forward. Because there were so many people watching that day, the road was blocked, so he crossed diagonally to the opposite sidewalk. Suddenly, someone arrested him, and then a Westerner brought him to the injured party. At that time, many people were watching him, but he really did not know who the injured party was. Then, the defendant's witness Lin Jiu took the stand, stating that he lived on the third floor of 39 Shandong Street and worked as a painter. On the day of the incident, he and the injured party worked together at the Murray Barracks. He finished work at 5 p.m. that afternoon and returned home. He did not know what happened afterwards. At this point, the evidence had been recorded. The judge discussed the case with the jurors. The jurors retired to deliberate and then returned to the court and announced, by a vote of six to one, that the defendant's first charge of attempted murder should be dropped due to insufficient evidence. The second charge of causing bodily harm was upheld. The judge then addressed the defendant, saying that, fortunately, the injured party had a felt hat to protect his head; otherwise, the injuries would have been much more serious and your crime would have been much greater. Now, the jurors unanimously find you guilty. The defendant was sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor. Finally, Justice McKillop announced that the remaining criminal cases for this month would be postponed until next Monday.

### Armed Robbery by Four Thieves in Ho Sheung Heung, Lok Ma Chau; Mr. and Mrs. Hou Robbed of Over One Hundred Dollars in Valuables; Village Guards Heard the Alarm and Pursued the Thieves, But They Had Already Fled

House number 17 in Ho Sheung Heung Village, Lok Ma Chau, New Territories, is where resident Hou Yi (48 years old) and his family live. House number 18 is where his son, Mr. Hou, and his wife, Liao Ying (23 years old), live. At 12:30 a.m. yesterday morning, Hou Yi was awakened from his sleep by the sound of prying at the door. He saw four bandits break in. The leader was about twenty years old, wearing a black cloth shirt and pants, and holding a revolver. The three bandits following behind were also about twenty years old, wearing black shirts and pants, but none of them had weapons. Only one bandit was holding a flashlight. All four bandits spoke with a Shenzhen accent and appeared extremely fierce. After entering the house, the one with the gun immediately threatened Hou Yi and his family with the gun. Seeing that the bandits had a gun, and fearing harm, everyone dared not resist. The bandits then tied up everyone and gagged them, confining them to a corner. Then, they split up to rummage through boxes and chests, searching for about half an hour. Three bandits then left the house and went to the house of Hou's daughter-in-law, Liao Ying, next door, while one bandit remained to watch over Hou Yi and the others. The three bandits also broke down the door and entered, first subduing the people in the house and tying them up, then searching for about half an hour. After successfully robbing the house, the three bandits went to the house of farmer Zeng San (60 years old) at number 16 next door. However, for some unknown reason, they immediately came out of the house, so Zeng's family was spared from being robbed. The one bandit returned to Hou Yi's house, and together with the bandit guarding the house, they fled back to Shenzhen in the Chinese territory. It is suspected that the four bandits came from Shenzhen. After the bandits left, the people in Hou's two houses managed to untie themselves after a long time. They blew a whistle to alert the authorities and inspected their losses. Hou's two families were robbed of HK$145 (including five HK$10 bills, eighteen HK$5 bills, and HK$5 in small change), three dollars and six dimes in Cantonese currency, a steel dart worth three dollars, a black velvet coat worth two dollars, a silver ring worth two dollars, a pearl hair ornament worth twenty dollars, a gold hair clip worth two dollars, and a flashlight worth five dimes, totaling HK$182.50. Soon, villagers heard the alarm whistle and came out to investigate. After learning of the robbery, they armed themselves and gave chase, but it was too late, and the bandits had already fled. They had no choice but to report the case to the Lok Ma Chau Police Station. After receiving the report, the police station immediately telegraphed all district police stations to file the case and search for the bandits.

### The Salvation Army Will Expand Shelters to Rescue Child Prostitutes; Current Capacity is Only Thirteen; Authorities Sympathetic and Considering Assistance in Building Shelters

The Salvation Army held its annual meeting at the Kowloon Headquarters last Tuesday. Attendees included Governor of Hong Kong Sir Geoffrey Northcote and his wife, Mr. Proler (Chairman), and Commissioner Burton of the Salvation Army, totaling over one hundred people. After the meeting began as scheduled, Mr. Burton first reported on the work of the past year. He also mentioned the issue of prostitution in Hong Kong, stating that due to the recent global economic recession, women are often forced by circumstances to engage in prostitution. Even underage girls have been found. This is truly a negative aspect of Hong Kong. The current priority is to expand shelters to accommodate girls who have escaped from prostitution, so that they do not wander aimlessly and fall back into the mire. They should be treated for their hidden illnesses and find ways to become self-reliant, so that their minds and bodies can find a home and regain their vitality. The Salvation Army will strive to resolve this issue. However, due to the limited space and inadequate equipment of the existing shelters, and the large number of those seeking refuge, they find it difficult to cope. Moreover, the original shelters accommodate juvenile offenders or homeless girls, many of whom do not know what prostitution is. It is impossible to mix them together. Therefore, they sincerely hope that all parties will vigorously assist in this meaningful cause to eliminate this stain on Hong Kong. Then, Chairman Proler stated that building shelters to accommodate liberated child prostitutes is an urgent matter and a responsibility that the government should fulfill. The "Little Star" in the garden of the hospital is Hong Kong's only shelter, but its capacity is limited to only thirteen people, while thousands of girls outside are in dire need of help. How can they be properly cared for? It is said that there are no fewer than 25,000 prostitutes in Hong Kong. The Salvation Army has only rescued a tiny fraction from prostitution. If there were shelters that could accommodate them, they would have a place to go. Who would then risk shame to engage in immoral activities? Finally, the Governor stated that the authorities are sympathetically considering the issue of subsidizing the Salvation Army to build more shelters and hope that practical solutions will be found soon.

### The Rice Shortage Remains Unresolved; Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce Again Appeals to the Central Government; Purchasing and Transporting Domestic Rice to Provide Relief is Too Slow to Meet the Urgent Need

The rice shortage in Chaozhou and Meizhou is extremely severe. The Hong Kong Chaozhou Eight Counties Chamber of Commerce and the Jiaying Prefecture Chamber of Commerce have repeatedly telegraphed China and Britain requesting the exemption of import duties on foreign rice to provide relief. Subsequently, they received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stating that it would be more appropriate to purchase and transport domestic rice for relief. The people of the two prefectures, hearing this news, feared that transporting domestic rice would be difficult and that large-scale relief would be impossible. The fear of starvation remains difficult to resolve, and many people are worried. Although purchasing and transporting foreign rice would affect foreign exchange reserves, the people's food supply and national defense are equally important. Both should be taken into consideration to provide relief. The Chaozhou and Jiaying Prefecture Chambers of Commerce in Hong Kong are particularly concerned about this issue. Yesterday, they sent another urgent telegram to the central government, earnestly requesting this and asking Chairman Li of the provincial government to jointly appeal to the central government on their behalf to achieve this goal.

### Tea Exports Increase Sharply; All Concentrated in Hong Kong and Then Re-exported; Value in January Exceeds Two Million National Currency

The China Trade Commission controls the export of foreign-owned tea, entrusting the Hong Kong China Tea Company and various tea firms to purchase it, and also requesting various Chinese-owned banks to provide tea loans. On the one hand, they are improving tea production and promoting tea production areas. Last year's tea exports totaled 416,246 quintals, worth 33,054,085 yuan. Hong Kong accounted for the largest share, with 239,099 quintals, worth 17,672,659 yuan. In January this year, exports were 26,901 quintals, worth 2,152,077 yuan. All are concentrated in Hong Kong and then re-exported to various countries (all figures in national currency). Before the war, foreign-owned tea exports were concentrated in Shanghai. After the war, the Trade Commission controlled them and concentrated them in Hong Kong. At that time, they agreed to the request of the Shanghai Foreign-Owned Tea Industry Association to allow Grade B tea, which was not suitable for the Soviet market, to be transported to Shanghai and sold by foreign-owned tea firms, provided that foreign exchange from exports was settled in accordance with the law. From this year on, all tea exports will be concentrated in Hong Kong and will not be allowed to be transported to Shanghai for sale. As a result, various foreign-owned tea firms in Shanghai have sent personnel to establish branches or offices in Hong Kong to engage in foreign-owned tea exports.

### Regarding the Guangdong Situation, External Assistance is Lacking, Internal Controls are Tight; Our Forces in Western Guangdong Preparing for a Major Battle; Rising Waters in the West River Have Washed Away Many Defensive Installations Along the Banks; Deng Longguang Convenes a Military Conference to Discuss a Counter-Offensive Plan

(Special Dispatch from Zhaoqing) Our forces are preparing a large-scale counter-offensive from Guangdong, and a major battle is imminent. Although the situation in the western Guangdong region appears calm on the surface, the underlying circumstances are extremely tense. A summary of recent developments is as follows:

Enemy Gunboats Moving Towards the East and West Rivers

According to intelligence received from a military agency, more than twenty enemy shallow-draft warships and over a hundred armored electric boats and gunboats have been concentrated in the Pearl River estuary around White Swan Pool and Whampoa. In recent days, they have also been continuously moving towards the East and West Rivers. Their intention is believed to be a special operation, or they may be taking advantage of the heavy spring rains and high river levels to expand their encroachment along the waterways. Our military authorities have telegraphed orders to local defense forces to be prepared.

Enemy Busy Building Fortifications in Yangmei

The enemy forces in Sanshui have recently increased significantly, with various units identified, including elements of the enemy’s Fifth Division and the enemy’s Eighteenth Division. However, these are partial detachments and not complete divisions. On the 19th, another 500 enemy engineers arrived from Foshan via the Guangsan Railway to Hekou. After a brief rest, they immediately proceeded to the Ximei Jitang area to construct fortifications. The enemy is particularly focused on the Mafang line, deploying defenses along the coast at Langang, Mumian, and other locations to prevent our forces from crossing the river to attack and to provide opportunities to attack Sihui. They also fear that our forces from Lubao and Tanbu may outflank them, so they are urgently strengthening fortifications to resist. However, our encirclement is already complete, and even if the enemy fights desperately, they will find it difficult to escape our grasp.

Rising Waters in the West River Wash Away Enemy Bridge

To facilitate reinforcement and retreat, the enemy forces in Ge Wei had previously constructed two pontoon bridges using more than twenty large boats at Lao Ya Zhou, located between Hekou and Ge Wei. One bridge connected to Ge Wei, and the other connected to Hekou, allowing enemy troops in Hekou and Ge Wei to move freely between the two locations. Recently, rising waters in the West River caused the swift currents to wash away the pontoon bridge from Hekou to Ge Wei on the 18th. The enemy had repaired it not long ago, but it was washed away again. On the morning of the 19th, the enemy pontoon bridge from Lao Ya Zhou to Hekou was also washed away in several sections and could not be rebuilt. The enemy in Ge Wei is now in a state of panic, fearing that a large-scale attack by our forces will leave them with no escape route. They have sent more than a hundred soldiers from Hekou to Ge Wei by electric boat to hold the key points, and they have parked more than twenty boats along the shore to facilitate escape at any time.

Enemy Forcibly Consripts Laborers Without Paying Wages

Grain is extremely scarce in Sanshui. The enemy has looted all the grain reserves in the villages, and rice prices are soaring. Lower-quality rice costs around four catties per yuan, severely oppressing the people. If they do not die at the hands of the enemy, they will starve to death. Consequently, they are rising up in self-defense and joining the guerrillas. Seeing the perilous situation, the enemy has transported a large quantity of grain from Guangzhou and is implementing so-called "price stabilization" measures, with prices slightly lower than market prices to placate the people. However, each person is limited to buying only four mao of rice. Villagers forcibly conscripted to build fortifications and roads for the enemy are not paid wages, but are given three sheng of rice per day.

Our Forces Confer on Counter-Offensive Plan

Commander-in-Chief Xia Wei of the Sixteenth Army Group believes that the enemy forces in the West River are exhausted due to insufficient troop strength, and this is a good time to launch a counter-offensive. He has dispatched Staff Officer Zhai to the front lines in Western Guangdong to relay counter-offensive plans. Staff Officer Zhai arrived in Zhaoqing yesterday and will hold a military conference in a designated location this week with Army Commander Deng Longguang to discuss operational strategies. Tax Police Commander Zhang Jun Song, Division Commander Wang De Quan Zhang Chi, Army Headquarters Chief of Staff Liu Shao Wu, and others have all been summoned by Army Commander Deng to return from the front lines to attend the conference. Commander-in-Chief Xia is currently occupied with important matters in the Southwest Headquarters, but he will rush back to the Western Guangdong front lines to take command as soon as he finishes. Military operations in Western Guangdong are rapidly escalating, and a major battle is imminent.

### Enemy Intends to Invade the West; Enemy Warships Massing at Weizhou Island; Situation in Beihai is Slightly Tense, but the Local Area is Peaceful; Traitors Spread Rumors, Authorities Establish a Communications Network

[Special Dispatch from Guangzhou Bay] Lately, enemy warships have been patrolling and spying along the coast of Southern Guangdong. Enemy aircraft have been continuously bombing wildly, making the situation somewhat tense. In addition, traitors everywhere are spreading rumors, so the people's hearts are quite agitated. However, according to reports from various sources, due to the enemy's thin forces, a large-scale invasion of Southern Guangdong in the short term is not likely. The current expansion of harassment by enemy aircraft and warships is actually a deliberate demonstration of intimidation. Around the 15th, it was again widely rumored that the enemy had landed in Beihai. The reporter immediately inquired in various places. According to reports, on the morning of the 15th, one enemy cruiser sailed to the waters off Guantouling in Beihai. Around 10:00 a.m., one enemy shallow-draft warship was discovered, anchored about 10,000 meters from the coast, but there was no unusual activity. Around 3:00 p.m., the two warships sailed successively to the southwest. The rumor of an enemy landing is unfounded. Furthermore, more than ten enemy warships previously gathered off the coast of Yangjiang Dianbai have moved inland one after another, gathering in the waters between Weizhou Island and Haikou to spy on us. The situation in Beihai is therefore somewhat tense. Moreover, the newly appointed Administrative Commissioner of the Seventh District, Zhang Yan, and the Administrative Commissioner of the Eighth District, Deng Shizeng, after taking office, saw that the situation in the southern region was becoming increasingly tense and, to strengthen the defense, mobilized the masses to participate in the war. After discussing joint defense matters via telegram, they determined that during wartime, governance is closely related to transportation. However, highways are damaged, and the transmission of documents and information is difficult. A communications network must be re-established. Therefore, they have expanded and reorganized the original postal relay stations in various counties and established them widely in order to facilitate the transmission of all government orders and military information and to benefit the implementation of essential wartime policies.

### Ministry of Finance Promulgates Measures for the Collection and Sale of Gold; Provincial Government Issues Orders to Subordinate Units to Publicize Widely

[Special Dispatch from Shaoguan] The Ministry of Finance states that silver shops collecting scrap gold, making utensils and jewelry for sale, was originally a kind of handicraft industry. Later, due to the market price of gold fluctuating and uncertain, silver shops arbitrarily raised prices for profit, with considerable suspicion of manipulating gold prices. It was stipulated that the Central Bank should consider the situation in various places and set the official price with the silver industry to avoid market manipulation. However, gold is a monetary reserve, and the Central Bank will redeem it according to the Gold Exchange Law. The business acting as an intermediary in this regard should immediately have its measures clearly defined. The Ministry of Finance has now formulated measures for the silver industry to buy and sell gold, and has sent them to provincial and municipal governments to instruct them to make them widely known. The provincial government has now issued orders to comply with these measures. The measures are recorded below: (A) Silver shops can only buy or sell pure gold and 90% gold in the form of ornaments or utensils. Gold bars, gold nuggets, gold leaves, placer gold, and ore gold are all prohibited from being bought or sold (unless accepted by the Central Bank). (B) Silver shops in all localities should comply with the method of setting gold prices agreed upon by the Central Bank and set official market prices. They must not privately negotiate market prices. In places where the Central Bank has no branches, they should consult with the silver industry and use the market prices announced by the four banks and silver rights industry in nearby places with branches as a standard. They are still not allowed to privately lower or raise prices arbitrarily. (C) If a silver shop violates the above two regulations, once verified, it should be suspended from business. The various gold utensils, gold ornaments, and raw materials for the above products stored by the silver shop that has been suspended from business shall be forcibly sold to the Central Bank, and legal tender shall be paid at the market price of the day. (D) From the date of promulgation of these measures, shops that specialize in buying placer gold and ore gold but do not also operate silver shops should contact the Central Bank to sign a contract accepting the commission to collect gold. All placer gold and ore gold collected should be sold to the Central Bank in full and should not be sold privately. Violators will be suspended from business. The placer gold and ore gold stored by the gold shop that has been suspended from business shall be forcibly sold to the Central Bank, and legal tender shall be paid at the market price of the day.

### Our Mafang Artillery Achievements; Annihilating the Enemy Suzuki Artillery Unit; Enemy Forces in the West River Constructing Defensive Works

[Special Dispatch from the Western River] The war situation around Mafang has been quiet for a long time. For the past half month, the enemy forces have repeatedly attempted to invade the Mafang Jinli area, all to no avail. Since then, they have abandoned their attempts to invade from Mafang and have transferred enemy troops from the Mafang area to the Third and Fourth Highways, leaving only the Suzuki Artillery Unit and a portion of the Matsuno Tail Unit stationed in Mafang. On the morning of the 17th of this month, our artillery unit stationed in Mafang launched an attack on the enemy positions in Mafang, firing continuously at the enemy positions, hitting the enemy's fortifications. The enemy's Suzuki artillery positions were completely destroyed, and dozens of enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. They had no power to retaliate. The artillery fire stopped at noon. Furthermore, the enemy forces in the Hekou area have also transported a large batch of stone concrete to build fortifications and have built pontoon bridges between Hekou and Lao Ya Zhou and between Lao Ya Zhou and Jiao Wei.

### A Certain Bank Employee in Shameen Relates the Chaotic Situation in Guangzhou

A certain person who works at a certain bank in Shameen, Guangzhou, is currently in Hong Kong on official business for the head office. He arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago on the Jinshan Wheel from Guangzhou. He relates the details of Guangzhou as follows:

Unable to Govern

It has been several months since the enemy occupied Guangzhou, but they still have no way to govern. Therefore, public security in the city is becoming increasingly chaotic. Although this chaotic situation is sometimes reported in the newspapers, the details are lacking. The enemy is even better at propaganda and deception, so they have sent a large number of traitors to Hong Kong and Macau to spread deceptive rumors everywhere, saying how stable Guangzhou is now. Therefore, those who are deceived are unaware and fall into their trap. In recent days, quite a few people have returned to Guangzhou. However, after these people return to Guangzhou and witness this chaotic situation, it is difficult to escape again due to the complicated procedures.

Robbery Day and Night

Currently, most of the residents in the city, apart from a few legitimate businessmen who have shops in the city and have to risk returning to inspect them, are hooligans and thugs from the past and unemployed vagrants from nearby villages. Therefore, they go out to rob during the day, but at night, the enemy troops impose a curfew, and the hooligans and thugs dare not come out. The enemy troops move through the shops, ostensibly for inspection but actually to rob. Therefore, there are dozens of robbery cases every day.

City Commerce

Most of the shops in the city are operated by enemy merchants. Not a single official shop has reopened. Grain is entirely controlled by the enemy, and each yuan of military banknotes ("approximately one yuan and three or four cents in national currency") can only buy four catties. The enemy troops are constrained by our attached military units and often impose curfews. Once a curfew is imposed, the supply of food in the city is completely cut off. Even Shameen is affected, and sometimes bread is used instead of rice.

Inspection Disputes

All residents must obtain a Good Citizen Certificate and a Pass. There are two factions within the enemy army, causing many disputes for citizens who wear these certificates. The area from the Tianzi Wharf to the Xidi Shameen West Bridge Huangsha is guarded by the enemy Marine Corps. The enemy troops in this section are very strict in their inspections. Regardless of whether Chinese or Westerners pass through, they must be subjected to rigorous inspection. A person of a certain nationality was injured by the enemy army for refusing inspection. Therefore, all Good Citizen Certificates in this section must be kept hidden when passing through, because the certificate was issued by the enemy army. However, the entire section east of the Dazi Wharf is guarded by the army. Citizens must hang their Good Citizen Certificate when they go to that section, otherwise they will not only be unable to pass through, but also be in danger of being arrested. The infighting between the two factions is now fierce.

Puppet Special Zone

The entire Henan district is a gathering place for traitors and vagrants. Puppet maintenance committees have been established here, and opium dens and gambling houses are everywhere, so the order is even more chaotic. There are many robbery cases, and there are also several cases of fighting and assassination every day. Therefore, this area has become a special zone for traitors, and other citizens dare not mix in.

Shameen Houseboats

From the east bank to the Xidi along the river bank, the enemy fears that our guerrilla units will infiltrate the houseboats. All houseboats, large and small, are not allowed to moor there. The river opposite the Big Clock Tower has become a quiet river, with no boats interspersed between them except for the enemy navy's small steam boats. The enemy troops have only designated the south bank of Shameen as a place for boats to moor. Therefore, prostitutes and boat women are using these houseboats as temporary brothels, and the daily fee for overnight stays is two yuan in military currency. Most of these prostitutes are boat women. In addition, there are more than ten Zi Dong boats, which are women from the enemy country.

Confiscation of Civilian Property

Since its establishment, the puppet maintenance committee has moved all the furniture and sundries from the undamaged civilian houses in the city. The civilian houses are sealed. Now, any citizens who are deceived and return to the city must pay a registration fee to them before they are given housing. Even the owners must pay a fee to the puppet committee to get their houses back. This method is tantamount to looting.

Difficult to Escape the Lair

The enemy uses various methods, dispatching traitors to lure our compatriots back to the city as much as possible. After returning to the city, the enemy will seize the citizens' national currency and foreign currency as much as possible and force them to exchange it for military currency. Then, it is not easy to get an exit permit from the enemy to leave the city again. Even if you want to take foreign ships such as the Shameen or Jinshan ships to leave the city, the sailing schedule is uncertain, and the price of tickets is eight Hong Kong dollars. There are no silver coin exchange shops in the city, and military currency cannot be used to buy ship tickets. Therefore, it is difficult to enter the city, but it is difficult to escape this lair.

Demonstration Parade

Recently, our armies have gathered and the atmosphere for a counteroffensive against Guangzhou is extremely strong. Furthermore, fearing that our citizens will leave the city upon hearing the news, on the one hand, they spread rumors that we cannot retake Guangzhou, and on the other hand, they put on a demonstration. Therefore, last week they held a demonstration parade. All the enemy troops stationed in Guangzhou participated, and they tried their best to mobilize the tanks stationed in Guangzhou to participate in the demonstration parade in order to convince our people not to leave the city. However, apart from the puppets who participated, most of the citizens were afraid that something would happen and closed their doors. The enemy's skills can be seen to have reached the end of the road.

### Reorganization of the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters; Li Han Hun Appointed Chairman

Movies and Drama

### It Was Only Yesterday

Clark Gable is a household name today. When he walks on the MGM studio lot, people point and stare, all paying attention to him. But do you know that in this same location, he once bared his blackened body, with only a leopard skin around his waist, and awkwardly held a red rose, causing great laughter? When he dressed like this, he came out of the makeup department and went to the studio for a screen test. The workers saw him on the way, they whistled, they yelled at him strangely. But Gable didn't care, he still held the rose tightly, and just wanted to finish his road quickly.

This was the situation when he first came to the MGM studio. He had been appreciated by film director Leon Barimore in Los Angeles, and invited him to do a screen test. He came as scheduled, and was first led to the wardrobe department. There, they gave him a leopard skin, a short blade, and a rose, and then asked him to go to the makeup department. In the makeup department, he told them his name, and was stripped naked. Then, two people, without asking why, painted him completely black from head to toe. "Okay, put on that leopard skin, and go to Studio Seven quickly." "How can I go out like this?" he protested. They said, "No one will notice you."

That was true. In the studio, strange people are not uncommon. But the bad thing was that red rose. A rose in the hand is easier to attract attention than ten roses on a tree. He didn't walk ten feet out the door before someone started yelling. He started running, but the rose was still in his hand. Gable said that he had never heard so many whistles, and there happened to be a group of visitors that day, which made him very embarrassed.

Running to Studio Seven, panting, he angrily complained to Leon about the insults he had suffered. Leon said, "Forget about these things. These idiots may be congratulating a new star tomorrow. Go over there, and do whatever I tell you to do." Gable suppressed his anger and, with a full hope of becoming a star, walked to the camera. "What should I do with this unlucky rose?" "Put it behind your left ear... No, your right ear," Leon said, closing one eye from the camera to look at him. This was the test. Leon took him to see Owen Thalberg, who just told them to get out quickly. They were both drunk and a little confused.

Clark Gable only recently told this strange experience. He said that even now, whenever he feels angry, as long as he thinks of that red rose, the anger disappears immediately.

Among the red youngsters, there are a few who have a story to announce from the grain. Don Ameche is worthy of the word "red", but not long ago he was still a performer in a street art troupe. Tyrone Power also worked at an exposition, standing in front of the door to attract visitors. Robert Taylor only earned thirty-five yuan a week when he first came to MGM. Fred Astaire, after watching his "Dancing Carioca," was willing to return his salary to the company as long as they could destroy the film, which shows his dissatisfaction with his performance. However, it was this film that made him emerge late and leap to the throne of a red star. I'm afraid not many people know these strange things.

Do you know about an embarrassing incident in the early years of Jeanette MacDonald? She was performing in a dance at the Liberty Theatre on Forty-Second Street. Once, while kicking her legs, she used too much force, and a shoe flew out of the air, over the heads of the orchestra, and landed squarely on the lap of Swanson's husband in the fourth row. Of course, Jeanette was very embarrassed, not only because she was barefoot, but also because the shoe was dirty and old. She was afraid that Mrs. Swanson, who was picky, would get angry about this.

Eleanor Powell's entry into the film industry also had a fortuitous story. She won first prize in a dance competition in "Atlantic City", and the prize was a ticket to a boxing match. She went, and it happened that the great director David Selznick was also there. He discovered her. It seems that she should also thank that boxing match for her success today. That was the battle between Dempsey and Flrpo.

Adolphe Menjou once had a fight with a professor and was punched down the stairs by that professor. But later, they both entered the film industry, and that professor was Louis Wolheim.

When George Burns and Gracie Allen were married in Cleveland in 1926, he could only afford an eighteen-dollar wedding ring for her. And now?

You may know that Rodolfo Valentino and Alice Faye have never been happy with each other, but do you know why? This is actually a one-sided resentment. Rodolfo never spoke to her much, and only greeted her slightly when he saw her. The origin of this matter is that after Rodolfo Valentino brought Alice Faye into the film industry, Alice Faye became famous. To show her gratitude to him, she sang along whenever Rodolfo Valentino's orchestra went east to perform. When Rodolfo Valentino gave her a monetary reward, she refused to accept it. After a few times, a discord made the previous goodwill disappear completely. That was when the orchestra arrived in Manhattan one time, before Alice had gone. Rodolfo had already announced Alice's joining the singing in the newspaper, but as a result, she called and said that she could not come. Rodolfo Valentino thought that she had deliberately taken his platform apart, and never spoke to her again, although Alice still had the intention of reconciling, but she never got a chance.

The above are all things published by Xin Yi. Although they are not things that happened recently, they look like they are happening now. At the earliest, it was only yesterday.

### Throwback to Celebrities' Strange Gifts

Gary Cooper once received an old, rusty handgun from a ranch manager. It was found in a cave and said to be the relic of a famous bandit from many years ago.

After Paul Muni starred in "The Good Earth," he received a particularly interesting gift: a year's subscription to a Chinese newspaper, sent by a Chinese person. Although he couldn't understand a word, he felt happy every time the newspaper arrived.

Remember Birt Wheeler and Robert Woolsey? Woolsey was always chewing on an oversized cigar. A fan, knowing this, sent him a box of extremely high-quality cigars. Woolsey excitedly opened it and took a puff. Just as he was getting comfortable, "bang!" The cigar exploded, leaving only half. He tried another, but it was the same. The prankster fan had played a significant trick on him.

Louise Rainer once received a live, small carp and didn't know what to do with it.

Every Christmas, Jack Oakie would receive a pair of hand-knitted wool socks from an old woman. She probably loved him like her own son. Indeed, having a "big fat son" like Oakie wasn't the worst thing.

On one occasion, an inmate sent him a belt made of rope, which was quite exquisitely crafted. Jack was deeply moved and sent the gift giver five dollars as a reward. Unexpectedly, this started a trend, and more than a dozen belts poured in, all sent by inmates.

Joan Blondell had a Mexican fan who sent her gifts year-round, mostly leather goods. She felt a bit bad about it and deliberately replied, saying she had given everything he sent to her husband, Dick Powell, because the gifts were entirely unsuitable for her. Her wording wasn't very polite, naturally intending for him to stop spending money on gifts. However, the Mexican wasn't fazed at all. Instead, he wrote back, saying that since that was the case, he would send the gifts directly to Mr. Dick Powell from now on, saving her the trouble of forwarding them. Sure enough, he actually did this later, even sending some items suitable for women. This happened last year. It's unknown whether this generous gentleman is still continuing to send gifts.

Usually, gifts for celebrities are mostly small, exquisite, and fun items. However, a fan of Rosalind Russell had a unique idea and sent something enormous: a rather large oak tree. Rosalind planted it in her garden.

### Today's First Division Football League: Eastern and Scots to Meet Again at 5 PM at the Hong Kong Ground

(Special Report from Hong Kong) The mystery of the First Division Football League championship has yet to be revealed. However, based on the current situation, the top three teams in the continuing standings are the main contenders. In terms of continuing points, Navy has played nineteen games with twenty-nine points, South China has played eighteen games with twenty-eight points, and Eastern has also played eighteen games with twenty-five points. Navy has only one remaining game against South China, while South China, apart from this game, must also cross the harbor to face Kowloon. Eastern, on the other hand, will face the strong teams Scots and Middlesex. Therefore, the championship situation is still up for grabs. The outcome will only become clear after this week's games, depending on the performance of the top three teams. If South China can beat Kowloon on Saturday and Sunday and then defeat Navy, their score will exceed all others, securing the championship. If they are unfortunately defeated by Kowloon, losing one point to Navy, then the final battle against Navy will be a matter of life and death, decided by this move. However, South China must win to have a chance; defeat is hopeless, and even a draw will not help. Therefore, the key to South China's championship lies not in the game against Navy, but in the game against Kowloon on Saturday. If they can defeat Kowloon, their position will be more stable, and in the future game against Navy, they only need to avoid defeat; even a draw will secure the championship.

Eastern's points are two less than Navy's, so their position is slightly lower. They can only watch others succeed or fail and profit from it. However, they must still defeat Scots and the Middlesex Regiment to have a chance. If they win both games and indirectly benefit from South China defeating Navy, their score after twenty games will be the same as Navy's. In that case, an additional decisive battle will be necessary to determine the runner-up. In short, Eastern has not given up hope for the runner-up position.

This afternoon at 5 PM, Eastern will play against Scots. The strength of the two teams is not far apart, and it is expected that there will be fierce competition after the game starts. However, it is doubtful whether Eastern will field the same lineup, as Hau Ching-to and Song Ling-sheng have foot injuries that have not fully healed, especially Ching-to, whose injury is more serious. Yesterday, the reporter met him in the mountains and asked if he would be able to play today. He said that he intended to rest and would not participate in this game. If so, Eastern's front line will be missing a key player, and the attacking power will be slightly reduced. It is said that Yu Qia-xing will replace Ching-to. As for Ling-sheng's injury, it has slightly improved. For the sake of the overall situation, he will reluctantly play today and serve as a forward, with Xu Jing-cheng becoming the center forward. Judging from this, the lineup is still relatively complete. They should be confident in defeating Scots. However, it is hoped that those who are playing with injuries will not get hurt again and will work together to strive for victory. Scots are soldiers, and their fighting is brave. Those who encounter them should be careful, as they are easily injured. For the sake of Eastern's future, I hope that the entire army will be intact at that time, so as not to suffer unexpected losses.

Yesterday it rained, and it is not known what the weather will be like today. If the weather is not favorable, the players will feel difficult to play. Moreover, competing with the brave Scots soldiers is even more disadvantageous. Therefore, whether it is sunny or rainy today is very important to the Eastern players. If the weather is clear and the ground is dry, Eastern's front line, which is known for its surprise attacks, can be fully deployed, posing a great threat to Scots, and victory will not be difficult. If the field is muddy and slippery, and it takes a lot of effort to run, I am afraid that Eastern's forwards will not perform as well as they want. It is hoped that all members will work together to find ways to overcome the difficult environment, and then two points will naturally be obtained. At the same time, the defense must be wary of the Scots forwards' rushes, as the front line has no tactics to speak of, but the rushes are terrible. The lineups of the two teams are recorded below:

Eastern

Lau Hin-hon, Miu Wah-kwok, Tsang Chung-wan

Lo Wai, Hui Jing-cheng, Lau Chi-tuk

Yu Chi-hing, Song Ling-sheng, Lee Tak-kee, Ng Ki-cheung, Chan Bing-to

### Last Night's Basketball Games: Star Island Defeats Hong Kong University, Ching Chik Defeats Hai Kwong, South China Loses to Taichung

Second Division

The Public Men's Basketball League originally scheduled two Second Division games last night, and the First Division game between Pui Ying and South China was postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. Later, the Federation obtained the consent of the Star Island and Hong Kong University teams to temporarily play a game, so there were still three games held.

In the first game, South China played against Taichung. Both sides were evenly matched. Luo Hua-zhang, He Qing-he, Zhuo Hong-fei, Zhuo Guo-rong, and others from South China all made contributions. Xiao Qi-biao, Zheng Jia-biao, Zheng Kang-yong, Wu Yao-kun, Li Qi, and others from Taichung also performed well. However, Taichung's defense was stronger, and they eventually defeated South China 35-31.

In the second game, Hai Kwong faced Ching Chik. Xie Ting-yao, Li Zhao-dong, Xu Yuan-hong, Liu Jian, and others from Hai Kwong bravely fought, but Ching Chik's coordination was more consistent. Zhang Shi-rong's ability to score both from a distance and close range was always advantageous, while Huang Rui-an and Kang Quan cooperated well and frequently reported good news. As a result, Ching Chik won 49-33.

In the last game, Star Island played against Hong Kong University. Star Island's attacking power was stronger, and Hong Kong University was not willing to show weakness, fighting bravely. However, Star Island's passing was fast, and the forwards coordinated well, repeatedly breaking through with unexpected attacks, causing Hong Kong University to be exhausted. After the game started, Xu Kun-lun of Hong Kong University opened the scoring first. Li Shi-jie of Star Island was unwilling to be outdone and launched a strong attack, teaming up with Li Pei-yan and Zhong Zhi-qiang to attack continuously, breaking through several times. Lu Zhen-xuan also contributed by pushing the attack. Hong Kong University tried their best to support, and there were also some results. In the first half, Star Island took the lead 26-16. After switching sides, Pan Yao-jun, Dai Fu-cheng, and Liang Guo-duo, fresh troops, were sent out, and Xin Zhong-jian also rose up to attack, launching a strong offensive. The score rose sharply. When it reached 39-24, Lu Zhen-xuan returned to the battle, and it was unstoppable. Xu Kun-lun, Yang Xu-hua, Zhang Shao-mian, and others tried hard to support, but to no avail. At the end of the game, Hong Kong University lost 26-49.

### An Easy Victory: South China Easily Defeats St. Joseph's

Four players in the front line made contributions; General Da Shu did not take credit.

South China suffered a narrow defeat to the Police last week, and Navy was also defeated by Eastern, causing a sudden change in the standings. However, after suffering a disastrous defeat last week, South China went all out in yesterday's game against St. Joseph's, being cautious and careful, not daring to relax at all. As a result, they returned victorious with a score of five to one, showing that South China's efforts will surely bear fruit. However, they still have two games to play. If they can continue to work hard, the championship will surely belong to them. The South China players must work hard.

Not long after the start of the game, South China began to attack. Jing-xiang supervised the attack, surrounding St. Joseph's goal like an iron bucket. Soon, they forced a corner kick, which was taken by Dou-wen. The landing point was very accurate, but it was caught by the goalkeeper who jumped high. St. Joseph's took the opportunity to counterattack, and Li-an-na got the ball 20 yards from the goal and shot, but it went over the goal and failed to score.

Soon after, Er-xiang intercepted the ball in the center line, picked it over Yilinshi, and Sousa, seeing the situation was not good, rushed forward. Jing-xiang quickly passed it to Dou-wen, who did not fail his mission and scored with a shot, opening the scoring. After the center line kick-off, South China took advantage of the victory to pursue, and St. Joseph's made a desperate defense. Soon, they lost a corner kick, which was taken by Guang-sen. Dou-jiang Xia Xian jumped high to meet the ball, but the ball was reflected out. Guang-sen added another kick, making it 2-0.

South China quickly won two goals, with a hundred times more courage. St. Joseph's also tried to counterattack. Pala-ci got a pass from Li-an-na and rushed straight up. 30 yards from the goal, he passed it to Jin-shi, who shot over the goal and failed to score. South China counterattacked, Guang-sen got the ball and went straight up along the side, passing it to Qunli-yi shot, but it was blocked by Xia Xian. The ball happened to fall in front of Zhao-rong, and he pushed it into the net, making it 3-0. St. Joseph's counterattacked again, attacking straight towards South China's goal, but fortunately, the two inner guards tried their best to grab the ball, and nothing happened. After a few minutes, the first half ended.

Due to time constraints that day, the two sides did not rest. At the end of the first half, they immediately switched sides and fought again. Seeing that they had lost three goals in a row, St. Joseph's tried to break the duck egg. Di-lu-jia-du and A-lu-wei-shi switched positions, so there was a sudden attack, leaving Jue-jue in danger. However, A-shi's inner victory was too eager, and he actually used his hand to push the ball into the net in front of the goal. However, because the operation was not clever, it was seen by the referee, and he was penalized for handball. South China then cleared the siege.

Not long after, St. Joseph's attacked again, forcing a corner kick. Jin-shi got a chance in front of the goal and shot quickly, breaking the duck egg. Seeing that they had lost a goal, South China launched a full counterattack. Jing-xiang got the ball and passed it to En-liang, who shot and scored immediately. At this point, St. Joseph's was completely defeated, completely losing their fighting power. After a while, Zhao-rong went to the meeting alone. Mas-kui and Sousa rushed forward to stop him, and they were penalized for a foul, and a penalty kick was awarded. Guang-sen shot in, making the final score 5-1.

### About Sholokhov

—Original by V. Novich, translated by You Qiu

The whole Soviet Union knows Sholokhov's "And Quiet Flows the Don" and "Virgin Soil Upturned". These two novels have been repeatedly read by millions of people, from which they draw aesthetic pleasure and rich national knowledge, the various levels of the people and the genes of their actions.

The power of Sholokhov's literary work is not only due to his artistic talent; the indispensable value of his works lies in the fact that the author is a Bolshevik and an active builder of socialism. His multifaceted participation in national life every day is the most accurate way to learn about people's lives. It gives Sholokhov's works that enthusiasm, love and hatred, that ideal courage, enabling the author (like a scientist) to objectively understand life and present a faithful picture in his works.

This is a characteristic, so Sholokhov is one of the outstanding realists in literature.

Sholokhov is one of the most talented and popular writers in the Soviet Union.

Because of the comprehensive observation in his works, he is able to present a faithful and thorough depiction of the complex and contradictory progress of the new life in the Soviet countryside from all sides, so his works are remarkable.

The peasants Sholokhov writes about are not ordinary peasants, but a special group of peasants, the most fixed class division among the Cossack masses. The Cossacks have been systematically and persistently misled by despotism. He gave them various privileges, giving them the possibility of status advancement and the reward of acquiring money and land, making them produce personal extravagance. Moreover, the Cossacks are accustomed to being used as tools to suppress the revolution, arousing the people's natural hostility towards the Cossacks, making the Cossacks stand in an independent position.

These people do not understand that their interests are consistent with the interests of all peasants. They regard themselves as supporters of autocratic politics. Under this situation, it is clear that it is difficult to break the dreams of private property owners.

Sholokhov does not avoid this difficulty. In his wonderfully depicted realistic characters, we see the shadows of these people's internal resistance aroused by the fundamental changes in their way of life.

At the same time, we see how life itself crushes the old system; how the masses' struggle towards a new life grows and develops; and how the Soviet power, which gives the people's desires form, organization and direction, encounters the struggle.

All of this is consciously reflected in Sholokhov's works. His realistic talent and Marxist viewpoint enable him to expose and proclaim the direction of this development without evading or embellishing these contradictions, which makes the characters he creates complete, vivid and poetic.

In "And Quiet Flows the Don", Grigory, Mikrika, Aksinia, Old Mikrika, and Natalia; in "Virgin Soil Upturned", Nagulnov and Razmetnov, and many other characters live for the reader, erasing many habitual fixed concepts of people and life, enhancing the deep internal belief in the correct path chosen by the socialist country.

Another important aspect of Sholokhov's works is his extremely rich vocabulary, which helps him to convey the reactions tempered by the revolution to the readers in the language of ordinary people, especially the language of the Don region farmers.

He works with ordinary scientific intuition and artistic talent, which enables him to organically combine the choice of words with the structure of the dialect, throwing away purely crude slang. From this point of view, Sholokhov is the newest and most courageous creator of a new literary language in Soviet literature.

### Notes of a War Correspondent

— Translated by Mai Sui

"... Suei Meng News Agency Film Department member Mataro Hanabusa (30 years old) ... departed from Guangzhou on the 28th, bivouacked in Foshan on the 29th, and at 8:30 AM on the 30th, led by Captain Taita of the military headquarters ... left Foshan by car ... arrived in Sanshui at noon, and at 1:00 PM under the command of the Watanabe Unit, took a naval boat from Sanshui to Jiushui Village, about six kilometers southwest, sailing down the West River. At 1:30 PM, near Hezhougang (about five kilometers from Sanshui), from the high ground on the right bank of the West River, was suddenly attacked by fierce fire from the × people ... Under a hail of bullets, Hanabusa was suddenly hit and fell into the water ... Immediately drowned. The boat was quickly turned around to fight back against the × people and rescue him. At that time, Hanabusa-kun's figure floated on the surface again, still holding his beloved camera. Before approaching, there was no time to take out a bamboo pole, and he sank into the water. The boat turned back to observe, bathed in enemy fire, busy fighting back. Later, another search was conducted near the area, but nothing was found. A request was made for two naval boats and two small boats from nearby to assist in the search ... The water was 30 meters deep, and the current was extremely fast ... Declared hopeless."

The night is quiet. In front of me, a candle silently extends its long tongue of fire, as if pushing away the darkness and illuminating me. It has become the Chinese white paper and ink box, writing the words "In memory of the heroic spirit of the late Taro Hanabusa, died in battle photographing enemy lines near Sanshui on November 30th, Showa 13," nailed to the top of the altar with small nails. Opening my eyes, "Ah! Hanabusa-kun is really dead," I began to have a personal sense of reality. I cried alone. Although Guangdong has now fallen, I don't know how the death of Hanabusa will move those who are indifferent to sweeping up the remaining enemies! Doesn't the war to recapture Guangdong and sweep up the remaining enemies require battle? I stare at the candlelight, meditating in the quiet darkness on the deep and long war, and the deeper we go into the interior, the more endless the struggle is! (The End)

### Distant Ballad

— Huang Lu

When the bugle call of dawn sounds

I miss the eyes

That fly over thousands of miles, tens of thousands of miles

On the other side of the mountains, on the other side of the sea

Under the distant sky

In the snowy field of blood

In the difficult homeland

On the body

Of a free warrior

I miss

The trees by the stream

And the mountains...

### The Production of New Realist Literature

— Qin Wen

In literature, works of new realism are produced after works of new idealism. Originally, the advantage of realism lay in writing nakedly, realistically, vividly, and thoroughly, consistent with reason, which makes it deeply intense and gives it a strong power to move people. Because the romantic school before the realist school fell into fantasy due to idealism, and enthusiasm flowed into delusions, being weak and powerless, it was overwhelmed by the realist school. ——The attitude of the romantic school is close to play, and it cannot satisfy the desires of general serious readers, which is why the solemn and tense realist school arose. From this it can be seen that in deeply exploring problems and carefully studying the use of life, realism is better than relying on imagination. However, the realist school focuses on the reproduction of facts, which is inevitably constrained. When society is extremely chaotic, there are too many ugly things, and revolutionary means are needed to quickly change them, it is not enough to save the entire society with serious ailments by only relying on the realist school to expose the inherent environmental phenomena in a satirical way as an attack on the dark side, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it aches. Moreover, later naturalists neglect the bright side and always focus on the depiction of the dark side, revealing too much sadness, which inevitably makes people feel depressed. Readers in a gray environment are already depressed enough, and writing gray works naturally makes them more depressed, feeling hopeless and disappointed.

The remedy is to focus on the depiction of brightness, make people optimistic, actively express role models who are proactive, and encourage them, so that after readers understand what they should do, they will naturally and unconsciously put it into practice, in order to fundamentally transform the bad environment. Such proactive role models do not have ready-made models available in the inherent facts, so they can only be constructed by the author. This is the characteristic of new idealism. For example, before, there were no figures who could actually resist the invasion of the Japanese and the oppression of the puppet regime that could be used as ready-made prototypes. However, resistance must be prepared, and resistance must be advocated in literature. Therefore, the so-called nationalism literature at that time was propaganda to prepare for resistance. In addition to using stories of ancient national heroes to inspire, we had to adopt the means of new idealism to create model figures. From this it can be seen that it is an unavoidable matter in non-aesthetic life literature to create characters out of fiction: if there are ready-made models available, it is not only easier, but also more realistic. It is also easy to move people.

Now it is good, for more than a year and a half since the official war of resistance, in the fierce national revolution, many loyal men and generals who charged into battle and shed blood in the front lines are role models for the youth in the rear. The stories of the martyrs who gave their lives for the country with enthusiasm and excitement are good materials for enlightening future generations. Moreover, the activities of the guerrillas who are struggling everywhere, their hard work and endurance, and the various processes of victory and defeat can all be used as reference materials for the general public, as their examples, inspiring them to actually participate in the war. Or prepare earnestly to prevent the invasion of the Japanese. These facts, although they are past events, are exactly the ideal things that people who have not participated in them are seeking. To adopt themes from ideals is simply because the facts of the past are not enough to apply; now that there are so many vivid facts, why not use them?

Recording these new facts is a work of new realism. Although it is a "reproduction", it has the same "expression" effect as general works of new idealism. Not only can it be used as a demonstration propaganda among the majority of people in our country, but it can also be extended to various oppressed and small nations to be used flexibly. Because these facts are all model behaviors of uniting, fighting, resisting the strong, and defending oneself.

The so-called literature of new realism is not that the writing method is new, but that it is new in the nature of the theme, and this newness is not just "only recently" but is based on conditions such as resisting Japan, supporting justice, and jointly protecting justice and humanity. Works of new realism were rarely seen before except in Soviet literature, because there were so many of these facts only in the great revolution in the Soviet Union. In the future, we can also have many new realist literature. Although the nature is slightly different, the function of being realistic and able to demonstrate and encourage is the same. Whether it is the spirit of firm belief and perseverance in "The Torrent", or the spirit of not being afraid of sacrifice in "Destruction" and "One Week", we have all had them. Like the protagonist in "The Fourteenth", we already have them too. Not to mention the experiences of ten years of hard fighting and ten thousand miles of marching: the facts of the Eight Hundred Heroes and the isolated army fighting in Shanghai and on the battlefields, the brave soldiers' selfless feats can all be written into moving masterpieces.

The large-scale production of new realist literature will now become a by-product of our country's war of resistance against Japan.

### Dreams Outside Lei Yue Mun

— Xiao Wen

Conte Rosso gently slipped out of Lei Yue Mun.

Empress of Canada gently slipped out of Lei Yue Mun.

Leaving a homesick heart at the foot of "Flagstaff Hill," gazing at the masts of ships returning east on the sea during the day, and dreaming of flying outside Lei Yue Mun at night, how light the dream is—

Shanghai, this declining island, is not my hometown, but sixteen years of history have floated through my young life. It is not my hometown, but it is close to my heart, my motherland's land.

I have been in Southern China for two full years in May. Like a swallow, I want to go back for a while, to see this bleak old home, which has my footprints, my friends, my purple poems, my gray dreams, and the shadow of my blue past.

"No one can catch me"?

I have lived in Guangzhou in a brown dream

I have walked through Wuzhou, growing in hardship

I have walked through Liuzhou, where the river water is as clear as a mirror

I have walked through Guilin, a strange picture

I have walked through

I have walked through Guangzhou, which smells like rotting bananas

In a rocking sea ship, I am left in gray Hong Kong, enduring the fishy smell of the sea, the warm low pressure, not knowing when the end will come.

Conte Rosso gently slipped out of Lei Yue Mun.

Empress of Canada gently slipped out of Lei Yue Mun.

Leaving a homesick heart at the foot of "Flagstaff Hill", gazing at the masts of ships returning east on the sea during the day, and dreaming of flying outside Lei Yue Mun at night, how light and illusory the dream is!

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

"Do you think I can't hear it? Then I would have lived fifty years in vain." As she spoke, the lamplight shortened and went out. In the pitch-black bedroom, a human-shaped shadow deepened further. It was still the maid's voice: "Miss, where are you? Don't cry! What are you upset about? - Did that guest who just came offend you? - It must be, it must be - my ears are my eyes. As soon as I heard that young man's words, I knew he was not a good thing - Miss, where are you? I'm telling you, as soon as I saw that young man's eyes, it scared me to death! I felt like I had encountered a will-o'-the-wisp, not at all - alas, he also brought a gust of yin air, which really makes people shiver - I was thinking, tonight, I could - I really don't have good luck, I was afraid that the young lady would also have bad luck. It's true, I didn't think wrong." - At this time, the maid's two listeners: one trembling, crying softly, one hiding behind the clothes rack, almost afraid to breathe. The former and the latter, at the same time, fell into two different types of terror. One of them thought:

"This useless maid, why don't you ring the alarm? Don't you know that I have already been…"

The other one thought:

"If she shouts, what will I do? It's over. The best result is that I can only escape, but I should think of a way to deal with this woman; otherwise, when it dawns in a while, her words will probably not be finished!"

Yes, the maid's words, as if she had just reached the climax; she continued: "Miss, where are you? Turn on the light, let me chat with the young lady to ease your mind. I'd better turn on the light first!"

(Fifteen)
