### Lessons from the Fall of Czechoslovakia

Czechoslovakia can be said to be completely subjugated. On the 19th, German troops, led by General Gablenz, paraded through the city of Bohemia for two hours. The parade included infantry, artillery, tank convoys, and aircraft formations, displaying their might and flaunting their power. The German troops, acting as conquerors, forced key members of the Czech government to sit alongside German military and political authorities to observe the parade, while the Czech people mostly avoided it by going for walks in the countryside or staying away from windows, unwilling to witness the German military's procession. The emotions of animosity and the inner sorrow felt by the Czechs are imaginable. This historical fact contains a rich and profound lesson, which we Chinese compatriots cannot afford to ignore.

The grief over Czechoslovakia's fall is felt more keenly by the people than by the government authorities, yet the responsibility for it rests with the government authorities to a much greater extent, a hundredfold, than with the people. Today, key members of the Czech government still sit alongside German military and political authorities to observe the conquerors' parade, while the Czech people not only cannot bear to see the German military's show of force but even refuse to celebrate with waving flags. We can still clearly recall how, in September of last year, when German troops invaded Czechoslovakia, the Czech people were so generous and determined, willing to drive the German troops out of Czech territory under the leadership of their government. However, the result was that President Beneš's enthusiasm was completely buried, and the arguments of compromisers, such as General Syrový, with his one eye, completely triumphed. This victory left Czechoslovakia with the root cause of its complete subjugation today. How can the Czech people not feel heartbroken!

At the time, some commentators argued that Czechoslovakia could prolong its existence by not resisting, but resistance would lead to an earlier demise. However, looking at the current reality, what price has Czechoslovakia paid for prolonging its existence for this half year? Moreover, resistance would not necessarily lead to subjugation, and even if it ultimately did, the time would certainly be longer than this half year, and the Czech people would not have to endure this unspeakable sorrow in their hearts. The ancient Chinese saying, "Better to be a shattered jade than an unbroken tile," is a reflection of the regret felt by the Czech people today.

Secondly, the responsibility for the rise of German aggression should be entirely borne by the British and French governments. The authorities in Britain and France certainly recognized that the only way to avoid war at the time was to force Czechoslovakia to endure humiliation and cede territory. They also dreamed that by being generous with others' possessions and obtaining Hitler's promise, they could solve the problem once and for all. Little did they know that with the conclusion of the "Munich Agreement," Britain and France were completely fooled by Germany. Not only has today's reality proven that Hitler's "aggression" ambitions are limitless, but even judging by the situation at the time, if Britain and France had upheld their credibility and taken a firm stance against Germany, then the "Nazi" Germany, with its unfledged wings and many internal problems, might not have dared to risk going all the way. The military strategists' principle of "avoiding the strong and attacking the weak" was already deeply understood by Hitler. Germany does not dare to advance westward now but is prioritizing the completion of its eastward plan, which is based on this principle. However, if the German military succeeds in its eastward advance, and its national strength gradually increases and its material supplies become sufficient, then it will inevitably turn its spear westward to pursue its "Third Reich" dream of the past seven or eight years, which is within expectations. The authorities in Britain and France may still imagine that after Germany annexes the small countries of Eastern Europe, its target will be the Soviet Union, so Britain and France can permanently remain on the sidelines, or even fantasize about an opportunity to profit from the situation. But according to our observations, Hitler will absolutely not be so foolish as to collide head-on with a stone wall. He will still avoid the strong and attack the weak, and continue to covet countries that desire peace without paying a price.

Now, the "Nazi" crusaders will certainly continue their eastward advance. According to a report from the Romanian ambassador to British Foreign Secretary Halifax, 44 German divisions are preparing to move east, half of which have already been concentrated in Czechoslovakia, and the other half are being mobilized in Germany. Furthermore, according to a report from the Romanian authorities, German troops have already entered the Subcarpathian Ruthenia province from Slovakia, appearing to be preparing to attack Romania. At the same time, Hitler's mouthpiece, Goering, is ranting: "Germany has such heroic soldiers—referring to Hitler—and must have a heroic nation as their backing." According to this reasoning, if the "heroic soldiers" annex Eastern Europe, the "heroic nation" will inevitably conquer the world. When Goering greatly praises "our leader" as being so great and so glorious, and emphatically states, "Only great things are enough to repay our leader," the Czech people will certainly feel even more sorrow, and the countries of Eastern Europe will certainly tremble with fear. We can only wonder what the British and French authorities think of Germany's arrogance!

If the small countries of Eastern Europe do not want to repeat the disastrous fate of Czechoslovakia, they must prepare early and make active resistance with all their strength. All invaded nations, if they want to survive, must resist to the end. If Britain and France want to prevent the advance of the aggressors and create a backlash, they must advise the aggressors with full armament as soon as possible. Advising the aggressors does not necessarily lead to war. "Armed peace" can still be applied to aggressors whose wings are not yet fully formed. Britain and France can no longer entertain the illusion that Germany will advance further east and invade the Soviet Union, because the advance of the "Nazi crusaders" has very strict boundaries. It is heard that the British Cabinet has decided to strengthen contact with all peaceful countries to cope with this new European situation, and some in the British government are even advocating a conference between Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. This is welcome news, and it is hoped that it will become more concrete.

### How the Soviet Red Army Cooperates with the People

— By Soviet Cavalry Marshal Budyonny, translated by Mei Zhen from "Moscow News"

Comrade Stalin, at the celebration conference of the Moscow Soviet, addressed the brave Red Army of the Soviet Union, saying:

"Regarding the loving and intimate relationship between the army and the people, there is no place in the world that can compare with our Soviet Union. In our country, the army is loved, respected, and universally cared for by the people. Why is this possible? Because the workers and peasants have created their own army, which serves not the masters, but the former slaves, the now liberated workers and peasants. This is the first time in the world."

The Red Army, the great protective screen and defenders of the victory of the socialist revolution, is connected by blood ties with all the people of our socialist motherland. The unity of the Soviet people and the fact that the Red Army is equipped with all modern combat tools are a serious warning to the fascist aggressors—even the bourgeois newspapers cannot but acknowledge this fact. This unity, this close relationship between the Soviet people and their army, is no secret to the instigators of a new world war. They also know this fact, and all the working people of the capitalist world also show the greatest sympathy and concern for the victorious socialist motherland and the army of the October Revolution.

The Constant Task of the Soviet Red Army

The fact that the Soviet Union is constantly surrounded by capitalist countries makes the Soviet people keenly aware that it is essential to constantly bear the task of defense, and to constantly pay attention to the enhancement of the Soviet Union's defense forces. Therefore, it is very important for the Soviet people to further improve the combat effectiveness of the Red Army, and to strengthen the Red Army both organizationally and technically.

The completion of the first and second Stalin Five-Year Plans has transformed the Soviet Union into the most powerful industrial country. The development of new industries in cities, as in the countryside, has become a major foundation for the Soviet Union's national defense.

During the first Five-Year Plan, the Red Army's technical equipment was completely transformed. Due to its organized military structure and its military training, it has become a first-class army. Even the enemy has to admit its strength and power, and the high standard of its weapons.

The Red Army's advanced technical equipment makes it the strongest and most powerful army in the world. Socialist industry is supplying the Red Army with automatic weapons, all kinds of machine guns and heavy artillery.

During the civil war, the Red Army was equipped only with captured spoils of war, such as tanks. But today, the Red Army has all kinds of tens of thousands of tanks. All these tanks are manufactured in Soviet factories, using Soviet materials.

The Soviet Union's aviation and its successes have occupied many records in the world. Thousands of the latest-style airplanes, various designs of airplanes—super-speed bombers, fast-flying fighter planes, reconnaissance and attack planes, and other similar airplanes—manufactured by Soviet engineers and workers, have greatly enhanced the combat effectiveness of the Red Army.

The Leadership of the Communist Party

The Red Army is led by the Bolshevik Party, which is its most fundamental advantage. It was this party leadership that guaranteed the decisive victory in the civil war. At that time, 300,000 members of the Communist Party, or 65 percent of its total membership, were fighting on various fronts. At that time, Lenin, the great leader of the proletarian revolution, stood at the forefront of national defense. Lenin and Stalin formulated and implemented plans for all major battles of the Red Army. Several battles that determined the fate of the Soviet Republic, such as the battles at Tsaritsyn, Bialystok, and Petrograd, and the various battles that defeated Denikin and Wrangel, were all planned by Comrade Stalin and carried out under his leadership. The Red Army was victorious in the civil war because the Communist Party, in its arduous struggle against the enemy, succeeded in developing an outstanding Bolshevik proletarian command cadre.

The former mechanic, a long-standing member of the Bolshevik Party, Voroshilov, is a military man with such genius. During the civil war, he commanded a small detachment organized by the workers of Lugansk. But today, he is the first marshal of the Soviet Union. A group of great military men—Frunze, Chapayev, Shchors, Kotovsky, Gais, and others—are equally famous.

The Red Army has become an invincible force because it has such excellent political leaders as Lenin, Stalin, Molotov, Kalinin, Frunze, Voroshilov, Ordzhonikidze, Kirov, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Andreyev, Shchadenko, and Mekhlis, all of whom have participated in the political training of the Red Army.

The Heroic Representation of the Party

The heroic cause of the party representatives in the army in organizing political activities in the army, and their self-sacrifice, naturally played a particularly significant role in the victory of the Red Army. These party representatives sent to the army by the Bolshevik Party brought with them the spirit of the party, the discipline and heroism of the party in the revolutionary struggle of the ×× class.

After the civil war, all the technical equipment and training of the Red Army were raised to a very high level. It is of course impossible to compare the equipment and training of the Red Army of that era with the current situation. Voroshilov once said:

"We firmly believe that if all this technology can be expanded by our excellent cadres in the Red Army, by our Bolshevik party members, workers, peasants, detectives, by our excellent soldiers, by our glorious infantry, cavalry, artillery, tank soldiers, engineers, aviators, sailors, by the entire strength and Bolshevik persistence of the workers, collective farm peasants of this great country willing to build a socialist country—the result will become a force that no interventionist can resist."

World × imperialism has attempted to test the strength of the Soviet Union by force more than once. The Soviet people will never forget the invasion of the Soviet border region in 1929 caused by the provocation of the Japanese army, such as the attempts at Changkufeng. These attempts have been stopped by the deadly blows given by the Red Army units.

Based on their own experience, Japanese × imperialism has had the opportunity to understand that in terms of the performance and quantity of its military power, and the military preparedness of its army, the Red Army has become a first-class army.

In 1929, the mechanized equipment averaged 2.6 horsepower per person in the ranks of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, while in 1933 the number rose to 7.7 horsepower, and in the last five years there has been an amazing increase. Our current rifle divisions, in terms of their organization, technical equipment, and combat effectiveness, have been listed among the most advanced of these units.

The Red Army's strength lies not only in its organization and equipment, but most importantly in its personnel. Our Red Army's cadres are first of all Bolshevik cadres who selflessly respect the motherland and the Party and possess extraordinary military capabilities. The commanders of the military regions, armies, divisions, brigades and regiments are almost entirely members of the Bolshevik Party, and 75 percent of the lieutenants, captains and majors are members of the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. The Red Army's personnel are brave and progressive people who contribute all their abilities and knowledge to the strength and progress of the motherland.

Among them, there are countless outstanding aviators, brave submariners, outstanding tankers and cavalrymen. In the last five years, approximately 4,000 commanders, political workers, engineers, technicians, and Red Army soldiers have received government medals.

The courage of Russian soldiers has long been famous. History has recorded many examples proving this noble quality of Russian military power. The heroic struggles of the Russian army under the leadership of one of the world's greatest military men, Suvorov, are well-known evidence.

When the Russian army won a series of important victories over the long-enjoyed invincible Prussian king, they gained fame during the Seven Years' War. In melee combat, the bravery of Russian soldiers, their endurance, and their love for their motherland, these qualities have long been famous throughout the world.

Maintaining the Glorious Tradition

The Red Army personnel, whose predecessors shed blood for freedom, peace, and the happiness of the Soviet people, possess outstanding military capabilities. The Red Army personnel will never lose the achievements gained by their predecessors.

The unity between the Soviet people and the Red Army, and the unbreakable blood ties, are the true guarantee of the country's defense forces. If the fascist aggressors dare to venture forth, then they will be waging a war not only against the Red Army, but also against all 170 million or more of the Soviet people.

The recent events in our country have most powerfully demonstrated this in all aspects. Let us talk about the events of Lake Khasan, about the call to join the Red Army, and finally about the strategic exercises of the Red Army units in order—everywhere, in all encounters, one can encounter a very vivid picture of the unity of the Soviet people and their Red Army.

During those tense days when the situation was brewing, the attention of the entire country was focused on Lake Khasan. It can be said that from July 29 to August 11, during these memorable days, every citizen of the country had considered himself mobilized, as a soldier in the ranks of the Red Army. And during these days, the Red Army personnel bravely fought for their socialist motherland in the Lake Khasan area, elevating themselves to the highest point of self-sacrificing heroism unprecedented in a country in the cause of defending the socialist country. The Soviet newspapers told us how many requests were sent out by the brothers and compatriots of the soldiers fighting at Lake Khasan, requesting that they be sent into the ranks of the Red Army to replace their brothers.

The Days of Formal Conscription

The young citizens of the Soviet Union consider the day they are drafted into the Red Army to be one of the happiest days of their lives. They think that they are striving to be worthy of the noble profession of a soldier of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and to open fire on the enemy. The day of formal conscription is not only a time for those being conscripted to serve, but also a time for celebration for their families.

In the Soviet Union, tens of thousands of young people, having long dreamed of entering the army for which they have been preparing for no less than a day for this noble honor, and joining the Red Army, become Voroshilov marksmen, cavalry soldiers, airborne paratroopers, and aviators.

Hundreds and thousands of young people are awarded with the Labor Defense Medal in preparation, and countless marksmen, aviators, and tank soldiers are being trained annually at the Stalin Automobile Factory alone.

All of this contributes a perfect explanation to these articles recorded in the Stalin Constitution:

"Military service in the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army is an honorable duty of Soviet citizens."

The People Welcome Red Soldiers

The strategic exercises of the Red Army are a true people's festival everywhere. During the exercises, the local people share some of the responsibilities of the soldiers, and the collective farm peasants become guides to help find roads, find wells, and other things.

The close unity between the Red Army and the people is guaranteed by Article 138 of the Stalin Constitution. Constitution 138 stipulates: "Citizens serving in the Red Army, on equal terms with other companies, have the right to vote and the right to be elected." When the people of the various Soviet republics elected countless military personnel as representatives to the Supreme Soviet, they declared their love and trust for the Red Army.

Enjoying the unlimited support of the people, under the leadership of the beloved Soviet Marshal Voroshilov, the Red Army has become an invincible army in the world. Events such as the Battle of Lake Khasan have shown more than once that there is no force in the world that can resist the military power of the Red Army, which is supported by the entire Soviet people.

No fascist theories about "storm troops" and "shock troops" can be verified or realized in Soviet territory. The enemy will suffer cruel blows, no matter what theories or weapons he may apply.

The transformation of the army from a force of oppression and conquest into a defender of the interests of the workers and peasants, a defender who is close to the people and loved by the people, is still a first in human history. Such an army, the armed force of this socialist country, is able to defend his motherland at any time and in any international situation, and the mission he bears—the mission of socialist construction, the mission of the Soviet people led by the world's greatest soldier Stalin.

### From Chongqing to Chengdu

On March 2nd at 10:00 AM, I departed from Chongqing by military vehicle, and arrived in Chengdu at 4:00 PM on the 3rd, covering a total distance of 530 kilometers. The entire route was mountainous. The area near Chongqing was dominated by towering mountains and sheer cliffs. After leaving Chongqing's borders, the landscape transformed into a continuous series of hills. About 30 kilometers from Chengdu, there was another large mountain range, with roads as narrow as sheep intestines. Cars ascended and descended, constantly navigating through precipices and cliffs. If one was even slightly careless, the car could overturn. Only when it got dark were we able to get over this high mountain, then the view suddenly opened up to an endless plain. Chengdu is situated in the center of this plain. Furthermore, after crossing this mountain, the wind suddenly picked up and turned piercingly cold. It is said that this strong wind was blowing from the direction of Xi'an.

The route passed through Yongchuan, Rongchang, Neijiang, Zizhong, Jianyang, and other counties. Along the roads and rocks, there were slogans such as "Military and Civilians Unite, Resist Aggression to the End," "Eliminate Traitors," "Kill the Japanese Bandits," and "Resistance Will Succeed, Nation-Building Will Be Achieved." The most proactive anti-Japanese slogans were seen in Rongchang County, where there were slogans such as "Consolidate and Expand the Anti-Japanese National United Front," "Prevent and Correct Compromising Speech by Traitors," "Serving Military Service is a National Duty," and "Evading Military Service is a Criminal Act." The group that inscribed these slogans was the Anti-Japanese Support Association Singing Troupe. In the countryside, such slogans are very necessary. Occasionally, I also saw the slogan "To Implement the New Life Movement, First, Stop Smoking Opium," which shows that opium may still be poisoning the rural areas of Sichuan.

On the first day, we had lunch in Laifeng Town, Yongchuan County. The town was very small, consisting of wooden bungalows. The restaurants were adorned with red paper Spring Festival couplets, and the couplets were all about resisting Japan. The rural restaurant's couplet read: "Farmers, Workers, Merchants, Students, and Soldiers Unite to Defeat the Aggressors, Villages, Cities, Towns, Everyone Sings of Peace." Ruifang Tea Garden's couplet read: "How Can We Live Under the Same Sky With This Hatred, May Soldiers Sacrifice Themselves and Achieve Righteousness, Slaughtering All the X People Before Stopping. We Can't Stand With the Thieves, Support the Leader and Resist Aggression To The End, Returning Our Mountains and Rivers Before We Are Satisfied." There were many other such couplets, which I will not list exhaustively.

There were many beggars in this town. Their appearance was completely like primitive people covering themselves with leaves. They stood shivering in front of the restaurants, waiting for the guests to finish eating, then immediately swarmed in to fight with the waiters for the leftovers.

Continuing forward from this town, we arrived at Rongchang County, and then Neijiang County. Not far from the county seat is Neijiang, which is not wide and the water is also shallow, but no bridge has been built. Cars must cross by ferry. In this busy time of military transport, this is indeed a major loss.

The car arrived at Neijiang County Town, and we stopped to spend the night. All cars traveling between Chongqing and Rongchang must stop here. Our car was slow because it was carrying too much cargo. When we arrived, it was already past nine o'clock. Cars from Chongqing and Chengdu filled the streets and alleys. There was almost no place for our car to park. It was even more difficult to find a hotel. After eating, we finally found a small room, about five feet wide and six feet long, with a plank bed, a straw mat, and a thin, dirty cotton quilt. There was nothing else. The window was about one foot wide and two feet long, with four wooden strips as window posts. Because I was unfamiliar with the local security situation, I asked the car's guard to sleep on a folding chair in my room. The driver and two other people went to a hotel they knew to discuss sleeping arrangements.

The next morning at 6:45 AM, we continued on our way. At 1:00 PM, we stopped at Qiuqi Town in Zizhong County for lunch. Things were not cheap either. Duck eggs cost three cents for four. Leaving Neijiang City, I saw a large wooden sign that read "Sichuan Provincial Agricultural Production Promotion Institute Sugarcane Experimental Area." From there until Zizhong, one mountain after another, all that the eyes could see was a green and yellow landscape. The green was wheat, soybeans, and vegetables, and the yellow was rapeseed flowers, probably planted after the sugarcane harvest. Seeing this situation, agricultural production is extremely rich. According to the locals, Sichuan's soybeans are second only to the Northeast, and a year of Sichuan's harvest is enough for several years of use. There are bunkers in every county, but Neijiang has the most, said to be for local bandits.

After Zizhong County is Jianyang County. The mountains and fields are no longer entirely green and yellow, and many mountain tops are left barren. Near the large mountain range 30 kilometers from Chengdu, agricultural production seems to be rich again, with things planted even on the mountain tops. Crossing the mountain is a lush green plain, and needless to say, agricultural production is also abundant. Having traveled through Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and then through Guangdong and Guangxi, and then arriving at such a place, I truly began to feel the vastness and richness of China. If the guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas can be sustained and developed, then even if Sichuan Province alone serves as an anti-Japanese base, I believe that the War of Resistance can achieve final victory. Not to mention the many provinces in the southwest and northwest.

The population seen along the way is extremely sparse. Occasionally, I saw three or four houses, all thatched cottages. The women under middle age all had short hair and their clothes were neater. The men all wore broken, earthy-colored long cloth robes, wrapped with waistbands, and their heads were wrapped with white cloth, only revealing the back of their heads. After passing Neijiang County, both men and women, old and young, all wrapped their heads with white cloth.

Arriving in Chengdu, the customs and habits of the people seem to be different again.

### Cooperation Between the Army and Civilians in Hunan and Hubei

Young children and old men volunteered to help in the war, officers and soldiers were moved and their courage was a hundredfold

【Central News Agency, Changsha, 20th Dispatch】Last month, during our army's attack on Yanglousi, the area was occupied for a period. According to the commander of a certain regiment who led the attack, when the unit was detouring near Yanglousi, they still had to cross a small river about several tens of meters wide. Although engineers had erected a bridge beforehand, the slope of the bridge was steep, making it difficult for people and horses to ascend and descend. More than a dozen nearby elementary school students happened to pass by the bridge while the engineers were working. After discovering this shortcoming, led by a person surnamed Ren, each of them picked up straw and tied it into small bundles, nailing them horizontally on the upper and lower slopes of the bridge, creating several grades. While the large army and horses were passing through, there was no slipping even with the continuous spring rain. Also, when the unit began to detour towards Yanglousi from a certain place, the roads diverged, making it difficult to determine the route. Many elderly men living in the mountains volunteered to serve as guides, showing no fear. Furthermore, the assistance provided to the troops by the people along the way in terms of drinking water, food supplies, and stretcher-bearing moved the officers and soldiers to tears, and their attacking spirit was thus redoubled, so the results of the battle were also satisfactory.

【Central News Agency, Changsha, 20th Dispatch】The reporter met with a certain guerrilla commander of the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi border area in a certain place. According to the conversation, the high anti-Japanese sentiments of the people in the front, and the harmony between the army and the people, were unseen in the months of the war of resistance. It is really gratifying that the army and civilians in the front now truly believe that victory in the War of Resistance is certain. They know that the only question is how to work hard to speed up the arrival of victory. For this reason, the people in the front have now truly been able to do all they can to help the army. They act as guides, engage in espionage, and carry out rescue and stretcher-bearing work. To date the troop has, in three months, eliminated more than 2,000 X soldiers, burned two X warehouses, seized more than 200 rifles from the X army, and seized more than 800 rifles from the puppet army, and captured eight X soldiers.

### The General Association for Comforting Troops Sends Personnel to Various Places, Carrying Large Quantities of Goods, to Comfort Anti-Japanese Soldiers

Together with the Guangxi Friends of Wounded Soldiers Association, they packed more than 15,000 comforting bags and expanded the comfort efforts in Guangxi Province in early March. The representatives of the 6th Army and the 32nd Division were entrusted with transporting large pieces of salted radish to the front line. In addition, over 10,000 new recruits were suddenly concentrated for training and will be dispatched to the front line soon. The association has sent personnel to investigate and plans to send a delegation to organize a comforting team to bring personal comfort items. The association also considered that the situation on the northern border and the Xiangfan front line is very tense. It has decided to send a delegation to comfort the troops separately.

### National Production Conference, the Preparatory Committee Drafts Regulations, and the List of Attending Committee Members Is Determined

【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st Dispatch】The Production Conference decided by the Executive Yuan is scheduled to formally open on May 5th, for a period of seven days, due to transportation blockages and the fact that it takes time for representatives from various places to arrive.

### Japanese in Shanghai Use Customs to Arrest Passengers; Vessels from Ningbo and Wenzhou Are Searched with Special Rigor

【Shanghai Dispatch】The X side has taken the power it controls in the customs to add more Japanese officers to the water patrol supplementary room and search ships coming and going on the Huangpu River, and arrest innocent passengers, and connect them to the "Water Military Police" of the riverside hotel. The Customs authorities have no way to intervene. Most of these newly added police officers were originally police officers from the Japanese police station, so they are very skilled in handling affairs. The Shanghai Customs has newly established a Search and Seizure Team, which is staffed by Japanese customs officials and is responsible for conducting strict inspections of vessels traveling to and from Ningbo to find anti-Japanese elements.

### Excellent Results in Conscription in Guangxi

【Guilin Dispatch】Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Guangxi has been the most rigorous and rapid in handling conscription among the provinces, because the basic political organization in Guangxi has been through five or six years of effort, and then the province's household registration has been clearly investigated and statistically analyzed. Counties and cities, as autonomous units, are divided into several districts, and districts are further divided into several townships, and townships are further divided into several villages. The head of the village directly manages household registration. The provincial government sends a paper order to the county, and the county government sends it to the districts and then to the townships. The heads of the townships immediately execute the order, directly reaching the village heads and then the household unit. The organization is connected, like the arm of the body, the finger of the arm, so the implementation of all government orders is particularly easy and agile. There are more than 24,900 villages in the province of Guangxi, with a population of more than 13 million, a vast area, rich resources, and abundant grain production. If located in Europe, it could establish a strong country. In recent years, after the hard work of Li Bai and Huang and other leaders, military training, political reforms, and economic construction have gradually begun to take shape. Although it has not been able to form the prosperity of modern society, it has somewhat achieved the policy of "self-sufficiency." The Zhuang adults of Guangxi, aged 18 to 35, have generally undergone three to six months of military training and have considerable military knowledge. In the early stage of the War of Resistance, each village was ordered to deploy 20 soldiers, using a lottery system to specify the order of priority. In total, more than 500,000 were selected. More than 300,000 of these 500,000 soldiers were used in various battlefields in the early stage of the War of Resistance. About 200,000 were concentrated in the rear for training and formed into regular armies, but they have not yet been sent to various battlefields. There are also tens of thousands who have been selected and prepared for deployment, but have remained in the villages. The Guangxi authorities are now planning to protect Guangxi and will bring together all the soldiers who have been selected but not yet conscripted in the early stage and organize them into special teams, which will be assigned to each county government for direct deployment. Each county will establish at least two to six special teams, with the number of teams and the number of soldiers determined by the needs of the local environment in each county. The deputy county head of each county also serves as the captain of the special team, dedicated to maintaining local security and assisting in regular military operations, in order to enhance the local self-defense capabilities. After the successive fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the early stage of the War of Resistance came to a temporary end, and the later stage of the War of Resistance began anew. However, the center of gravity of the later stage of the War of Resistance has shifted from northern Guizhou to the southwest. Guangxi is on the front line of the southwest and has a heavy responsibility to bear. As a result, the second phase of conscription in Guangxi has begun. The early conscription in Guangxi was carried out strictly in accordance with the conscription law jointly formulated by the Fifth Route Army Headquarters and the two agencies of the provincial government. Except for elementary school teachers, students, specialized technicians, township village chiefs, and those permitted to be exempted as stipulated in the regulations, regardless of their occupation, if they were adults of the appropriate age, they were all conscripted in accordance with the law. The restrictions of the conscription law were tight, and the enforcement of the conscription policy was extremely strict. There were even entire industrial and commercial enterprises where only one person was relied upon for production, or families of eight where one person was relied upon for support, or poor and unassisted individuals. Even these people were conscripted and not allowed to hire substitutes. If those who were conscripted evaded conscription or claimed to be doing business outside the area, the parents, siblings, wives, and children of those who evaded military service were detained without leniency. Last year, the conscription law previously set in Guangxi was slightly relaxed, and there were also regulations for the payment of deferment fees. Any adult of the appropriate age who was a civil servant, teacher, student, or had a special occupation and could not serve, could be allowed to pay a deferment fee of 100 yuan for one year of deferment after the head of the township or village certified that this was true before the lottery was drawn. The families of those who had previously been detained or who had their property confiscated for evading conscription were released, and this strict regulation was abolished. Now that the all-out War of Resistance has entered the later stage, Guangxi Province is holding a second phase of conscription. Further revisions have been made to the previous conscription law, and an item for military service substitution has been added. If someone is conscripted but cannot serve immediately due to circumstances, they are allowed to hire a qualified adult to substitute for them. However, if this adult has already been drawn in the lottery, when it is this adult's turn to be a soldier, they will be replaced by the other person as a soldier, and it is decided that the head of the village must employ conscripts. However, such qualified adults who substitute for conscription are limited to those who have registered in the county. Since the third revision of the conscription procedures, the people of the province have been saying that it is convenient for those who are not yet conscripted, and the number of those who volunteer to enlist is more than the number of those who substitute. Because the people are motivated by the enthusiasm to defend their homeland and protect their families, there is really no other good way to survive except to take up arms. In short, there is no need to worry about the source of soldiers in Guangxi, and there is no way to evade conscription. As long as the authorities are aware of the people's needs, are good at using regulations, and implement the conscription policy, enthusiastic and heroic young people who are willing to sacrifice everything for the country will naturally come in a continuous stream.

### Shanghai Assassination Case: Japanese Man Kawai Stabbed, Traitor Wang Shot Dead

【Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th Dispatch】A foreign telegram from Shanghai stated that there was a silk shop established by a Japanese man on the opposite side of the Shanghai Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road.

### Jiangxi Provincial Department of Construction Develops Mining Industry, Establishes a Factory to Refine Tin and Sells it Outside the Province. Agricultural Products Exported Last Year Also Prospered

【Central News Agency, Nanchang, 20th Dispatch】Before the war, Jiangxi Province's foreign trade was mostly exported through the Nanxun Road. After northern Jiangxi became a guerrilla area, the province's wartime trade department was established and switched to transporting goods by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and highways, which was still convenient. The Department of Construction estimates that the total value of exports in 1938 was approximately 120 million yuan, of which rice, tea, porcelain, and paper accounted for the majority, accounting for 70% of the total value. In terms of tea and rice alone last year, rice was exported to Zhejiang, Guangdong, Fujian, and other provinces, reaching about 1.2 million bags (200 jin per bag), totaling 10 million yuan. The total value of Anhui-Jiangxi red and green tea exports was over 30 million yuan, with Jiangxi accounting for half of it. The Department of Construction is now actively planning to develop mineral production and actively export it, and has set up a tin customs refining plant to refine pure tin for sale outside the province to enrich Jiangxi's economic power.

### Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce President Dodd's Safety Greatly Feared, Kidnapped and Taken Away, No News in Funing, British Authorities Exhaust All Efforts to Search Without Success

[Central News Agency Chongqing 21st] Tianjin Dispatch: It has been four days since the President of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce, Dodd, was kidnapped, and there is still no trace of him. The British authorities in Tianjin are making every effort to search for him, hoping to rescue him from danger as soon as possible. The Japanese side has also agreed to "cooperate" in the joint search. All parties are becoming increasingly anxious about Dodd's safety. According to reliable sources, someone saw Dodd a few minutes after he was kidnapped. The kidnappers took Dodd out of the back door and pushed him into a car and drove away. However, the car broke down about two hundred yards away, so it stopped for repairs. At that time, several people gathered on both sides of the car to watch the car work. Although some people saw blood on Dodd's head and a worried expression, no one came to help. About twenty yards away from the repair site, there was a Chinese policeman who also did not come forward to investigate. Dodd's hands were tied behind his back, and he sat in the car for half an hour. Later, the kidnappers hired a car from a car dealership on Dagu Road and took him elsewhere. The car then accelerated towards Dagu. An investigation afterwards revealed that the license plate of the car left by the kidnappers was fake. The general opinion of foreigners here is that this was done by pro-Japanese elements.

### Loan for Aid to China Case, British Parties Unanimously Support, The House of Commons is Full of Enthusiasm, Hoping the Government Will Provide More Assistance

[Reuters London 21st] British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon yesterday read the China Currency Act for the second time in the House of Commons. He said that although British trade with China does not account for a large part of world trade, it is still worth protecting and assisting, especially because China has a large population, and a slight increase in the purchasing power of each person makes a big difference. The current war is a severe test of the new currency system implemented by China since 1935. The Chinese people have adopted excellent technical steps, and overseas Chinese have remitted money to pay for war expenses. The stability of the Chinese currency system in the middle of last year was only slightly disturbed or had weaker credit. If the House of Commons passes this bill, it will be of great benefit to China's future. Labor Party member Lawrence said that he supports this bill because it can encourage British trade and specifically help China resist Japan. The time may come when Britain must consider strengthening China's strength. Liberal Party member Mand also supported the bill, but expressed regret that the scope planned by the government was still too narrow. He believed that the government should allow British goods to freely enter China. The loan issue is only fulfilling the requirements of the Allied Act. Conservative Party member Botuba declared that he only regretted that this bill was not put forward earlier and that the content was not sufficient. Labor Party member Smith moved to reject the bill, believing that if Britain does not change its political and economic policies in the Far East, it will not be able to stabilize Chinese exchange rates at all. He accused the government of not being able to advocate humanitarian aid to China because it dared not offend Japan. He also said that in the past eight years, Britain has actually helped Japan to do evil. Labor Party member Dingle seconded, saying that Britain's move was the result of past non-resistance to Japanese aggression. Conservative Party member Astor said that the veto should not be discussed again. If this move can give the Chinese government and people gratitude, then both houses of parliament should unanimously pass this bill. Labor Party member Bell Garcia said that if the purpose of the bill is to promote British commerce, he will support it. Simon offered assurances, saying that this was indeed the purpose of the bill. Bell Garcia then asked whether the continuous use of this fund was in cooperation with the United States and France, as in the Three-Power Agreement. Simon replied that other governments have also assisted Chinese finance in various ways, for example, the United States purchased large amounts of silver. This proposal hopes that the House of Commons will accept it and is Britain's assistance. Deputy Minister of Finance Wallace replied to the debate from all parties, declaring that summarizing the views of the opposition party members, a loan of 10 million pounds to China is indeed very effective, and all parties also recognize that the Chinese currency system is extremely stable and is extremely supported domestically. Whether the government has assisted China in the past is not important. This bill will undoubtedly be of great help to China. He hoped that this bill could be passed immediately in the House of Commons to avoid causing a psychological impact on China. The China Currency Act was passed immediately without modification.

### Trip to Suizao

— Special Correspondent Geng Ya

Visiting General Chen Li

When returning to Xiangfan by car from Suixian, I visited General Chen Li, commander of the ××× Division, in ××. In September of the year before last, he went to the vicinity of Taiyuan, Shanxi, to fight, and in December he went east to northern Jiangsu, serving as the commander of the front line of the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. He began to come into contact with the × army on March 9 last year. I remember that when Chairman Chiang Kai-shek launched the Northern Expedition ten years ago, because he hated the Japanese army for adding obstacles in Jinan, he had the heroic words that he would definitely annihilate the Japanese army in Taierzhuang ten years later. Indeed, Taierzhuang has such a superior situation, but first, the Tengxian line in southern Shandong must be firmly defended to lure × into the trap. Commander Chen shouldered this important task that day, with the heroic sacrifice of being willing to sacrifice and not hesitating to sacrifice, even his own leg was seriously injured, he did not care, and finally completed the mission of firmly defending Tengxian and luring × into the trap. Although the second-line commander, Commander Wang Mingzhang, was unfortunately outflanked by × and died heroically in battle, it ultimately did not harm the great victory of the Taierzhuang annihilation battle.

× Planes Really Know How to Mess Things Up—When I met Commander Chen, just as we started talking about the battle situation in northern and central Hubei, × planes buzzed and flew over like big green flies to disturb people. Young military judge Yang Dianru, a burly man, insisted on asking us to hide under a river embankment together. However, Mr. Yang was not timid. He squatted on the embankment and looked out with his right palm: "Three planes—, —oh! They're turning around, it's really bad, I'm afraid they're going to do that!" He kept leaning over and reporting to the bottom of the embankment as if he was on the phone.

Commander Chen continued the previous conversation on the field, talking about the battle situation in Hubei, and comparing the entire situation between × and us, listing facts and figures to prove that we have many superior conditions compared to the × people. We should turn to using these superior conditions and persevere to the end with the × people. A defeat in a battle increases the experience twice, and we can still quickly carry out second, third, and even countless serious blows against ×, and we must beat them so that they cannot step down, and then we can achieve the final victory.

He said: Looking at the first phase of the War of Resistance, although the × people won several battles on the front, they have since penetrated deep into our inland mountain areas, on the one hand reducing the effectiveness of mechanized troops, and on the other hand extending the rear transport line, increasing the threat to the rear, and losing their past strength in frontal combat, giving us a full opportunity to meet them head-on. At the same time, within our interior, when the water is clear, the fish will appear. In order to gain time for a long-term war of resistance, we have gradually eliminated internal doubters, and we must strive for smooth progress in political and economic aspects to match the active progress in military needs. Chengdu is a very favorable sign for the great cause of resisting the war and building the country.

—Indeed, when the × army fought in the early stages, they had a bit of a "one-shot" appearance in some places. Later, after the Xuzhou Battle and the Wuhan Battle, the original shape of "re-decay, two-exhausted" gradually appeared: Shanxi "sweeping the guerrillas" is tight; Hunan and Hubei flee in all directions, without an inch; Guangzhou limits itself to the area, not daring to cross the thunder pool by one step; Although Qiongdao is ready to land, it is no different from temporarily swallowing an international bomb—these are all signs that ×'s power will decline and soon die.

As for our internal affairs, there will never be another Qin Hui in the government, but the front line is full of Yue Feis who are loyal and vowed to eliminate the enemy. We are not pessimistic about the future of the War of Resistance, and we are not without certainty.

### War Clouds Looming Over Europe, France Secretly Mobilizes, German Troops Continue to Advance from Czechoslovakia, Hungary Fully Mobilized, Romania on High Alert

[Central News Agency Paris 20th] According to official sources, the Cabinet held a State Council meeting tonight and immediately passed a batch of legal decrees to strengthen national defense. The two most important are: (1) Authorizing the government to call up reserve soldiers; (2) Increasing the number of officers at all levels in the army and training the Willow Creek army.

[Reuters Paris 20th] It seems quite quiet here on the surface. It is said that the government's recent decrees will not be announced. It is understood that a method has now been decided to prohibit the public disclosure of all information related to national defense. Even if a mobilization order is issued, it will be carried out in secret. It is said that soldiers must go to report individually after enlisting. It is said that the mobilization will be more extensive than in September last year, when about 120,000 people were mobilized.

[Associated Press Paris 20th] France began a secret partial mobilization of thousands of reserve officers and soldiers tonight. This is the result of President Lebrun signing sixteen new orders after the Cabinet granted the government wartime privileges. At present, only three regions are truly mobilized, but the government already has the power to mobilize other personnel as needed. An army official has admitted that a large number of personnel will be enlisted. The situation shows that this mobilization will be more extensive than in September last year, when about 120,000 people were mobilized.

[Central News Agency London 20th] The French government has secretly ordered the mobilization of troops. The initial mobilization number is about 60,000 people, and reservists will also be gradually called up until there are 20 to 40 divisions.

[Reuters Paris 20th] After the Cabinet meeting today, a Mediterranean conference was held in the Army Department. Daladi, the Governor of Algeria, and officials stationed in Morocco and Tunisia attended to discuss the plan to send vehicles to the Mediterranean to protect Morocco's territories.

The conflict occurred when the demonstrators returned from the funeral of those killed in the previous conflict.

[Reuters Paris 21st] According to the "Liberal Radical News" here, it is reported that German troops have begun to move on the border between East Prussia and Lithuania.

[Reuters Memel 20th] It is rumored here that Germany is currently considering making demands on Lithuania, but both sides denied it late tonight.

German officials in Memel Province are reinstated and continue to receive their original salaries. Lithuanian troops and border police are withdrawn.

[Reuters Stockholm 21st] The Swiss Federal Parliament opened yesterday, and the government read a declaration in public, stating that Switzerland vows to defend the integrity of its national territory with its last drop of blood.

[Central Red has left Paris 21st] Rumors that Romanian troops have been concentrated in the southern and southeastern parts of Hungary have been officially denied by Romania.

[Reuters Budapest 20th] Foreign Dispatch: According to the Budapest correspondent of Havas News Agency, the German government has made a request to Hungary that when an international incident occurs, Hungary allows German troops to pass freely. Hungarian government officials have divided opinions on this request. Some agree to allow Germany's request, while others advocate following the "Third Axis" policy of Romanian Foreign Minister Colonel Burke and forming an alliance with Romania. However, the situation is critical now, and individual talks are being held separately with Germany and the other side, hoping to find a possible solution. At the same time, it is learned that the Hungarian government ordered the mobilization of reserve troops on Monday to prepare for the concentration of difficult troops on the border. Full mobilization can be completed on March 28.

[Associated Press Bucharest 21st] Romanian King Carol held a meeting with the Prime Minister and the General Staff in the palace today. The atmosphere of fear here is gradually increasing, and banks and commercial firms are planning to withdraw in preparation for the event of an international conflict. According to unconfirmed reports, the military has concentrated on the Romanian border, and it is rumored that four German troops have entered Luxembourg from Slovakia. At the same time, the Second Romanian Reserve Army has been ordered to protect Bucharest and will continue to issue enlistment orders. It is also learned that Hungarian minorities are demonstrating in various parts of the Romanian border.

[Associated Press Prague 21st] German troops have been leaving Prague all day, heading southeast. It is not known whether they are heading to Luxembourg. It is also learned that in Luxembourg, the Luxembourg garrison is still fighting fiercely against Hungary. At the same time, large German troops are still advancing towards Moravia and Bohemia. The number of Jews committing suicide is endless all day long.

[Reuters Budapest 21st] Officials here have just denied the report that Germany has requested German troops to pass through Hungarian territory. Relations between Romania and Hungary are not very good, and both sides are taking precautions on the border. However, what the future holds depends on the evolution of the overall situation. It is believed that Germany may encourage Hungary to take action in Transylvania, but at present everything on the eastern front is semi-quiet and uncontested.

[Central News Agency London 20th] The Soviet government today submitted a proposal to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, advocating convening a conference of peace-loving countries in both worlds. According to general estimates, the British government may express to the Soviet Union that in the current serious international situation, it is practically difficult to convene responsible authorities from various countries to meet in person.

[Haitong News Agency London 21st] According to a report by the foreign affairs correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, Russia's participation in the Six-Power Agreement depends on whether it can guarantee the security of the Far Eastern border, because the Moscow government is concerned about the safety of all aspects in the event of a war. The Daily Express expects that the Six-Power Declaration will be issued within 48 hours.

[Associated Press London 21st] It is learned that the ambassadors of various countries here have notified their governments, expressing that the European situation is indeed quite serious, but it does not seem that an incident is about to occur.

British Cabinet Discusses Central European Situation

[Central News Agency London 21st] The British government is currently discussing the situation in Central Europe with the governments of the Soviet Union, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Turkey, and Bulgaria, while also taking precautionary measures in all aspects.

Foreign Secretary Halifax stepped forward and saw the British King. The Foreign Ministers of France and Romania, and the Chargé d'Affaires of the German Embassy, also visited the Foreign Office yesterday.

[Central News Agency London 21st] Since Germany threatened Romania, the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union has become closer. This week, British Foreign Secretary and Soviet Ambassador Maisky had a meeting. Although it is not confirmed that the meeting was to discuss the formation of an alliance, both sides did give a frank review of the European situation. British officials only stated that the two sides decided to pay close attention to the development of the situation and maintain close contact with each other. However, according to reliable sources, what the two sides talked about that day was not limited to Anglo-Soviet cooperation, but also the issue of cooperation between Britain, the Soviet Union and other countries to prevent aggression.

[Central News Agency London 20th] Responsible sources said that the Foreign Secretary gave a report on the international situation at the Cabinet meeting today. The Cabinet immediately decided in principle to aid Romania and establish a collective security system in Eastern Europe to prevent Germany from expanding its influence to the Black Sea coast. It is said that the government is making every effort to organize a group, the nature of which is similar to the alliance that was used to combat Napoleon I's hegemony more than a hundred years ago. It is generally expected that the British and French authorities will issue a joint declaration after French President Lebrun's invitation to visit Britain (this month's 21st), stating that both sides are determined to prevent new German aggression.

The United States Uses Economic Aid to Help Democratic Countries

[Central News Agency Washington 20th] Most believe that the US government will not take active action on the rumored upcoming conference of peace front countries, because the US government can only provide economic and moral assistance to the peace front countries. Assuming that the United States sends troops overseas to participate in the war, it will not be supported by the American public. It is said that the United States has proposed to European democratic countries that it will provide economic weapons as their backing.

[Central News Agency Washington 20th] Authoritative sources said that in the coming months, the government will recall the ambassadors to Germany, Italy, and Japan for consultation. Congress is expected to immediately review the unreviewed parts of the national defense bill. At the same time, the United States will fully restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, appointing Stein Hardt as the ambassador to the Soviet Union. Pittman said in a broadcast speech last night that he will propose to Congress that the President should have greater power, the degree of which should be even stronger than what the President has requested. The President is scheduled to discuss foreign policy issues with key members of Congress today.

[Central News Agency Paris 20th] German Ambassador to France Chezak took a train home for duty at 6:15 pm today.

[Reuters London 21st] The Daily Mail's foreign affairs correspondent declared, "Londoners are quite worried because the situation is getting tense and there is a need to convene a conference of the powers quickly, as Moscow has proposed. The opinions of Britain and France clearly believe that a clear declaration signed by the countries concerned and signed by other countries is the first concrete step in establishing a new European security system based on mutual assistance." The correspondent said that the Soviet Union is prepared to do its best to participate to satisfy the wishes of the Western powers. He said, "It is rumored in diplomatic circles that the environment has forced Germany's eastward policy or will tend to stop, but Germany's next move may still be directed towards Lithuania in order to obtain Memel. Lithuania currently has no intention of taking effective resistance, but Poland will take a serious attitude towards the German army's invasion of Lithuania." At the same time, it is believed that the next development of the situation is related to Italy's request to France.

### British Foreign Secretary Speaks in the Upper House on the Seriousness of the European Situation: Free Negotiations Have Been Ruined, Germans Will Eventually Regret Their Actions in Czechoslovakia

[Reuters, London, 20th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax (see right picture) spoke today in the Upper House about recent events in Europe. "In a time of crisis, all partisan opinions seem to disappear," he said, to great applause. He stated that this incident has indeed caused a profound shock to our country and to people in foreign nations. It should be especially noted that when the Czech President and Foreign Minister were en route to Germany and negotiations had not yet begun, Germany occupied two Czech towns on the evening of the 14th of this month.

Occupies Czechoslovakia

Regarding Hitler's declaration that Czech territory was under German protection, Halifax said, "What we should pay attention to is that although the current administrative head established in Czechoslovakia is said to hold the position of head of state, and the protectorate is said to be autonomous and independent, Germany has established a resident official in Prague who has veto power over Czech legislation. Foreign affairs and the protection of foreigners are entirely in the hands of the German government. The German government also deploys troops to garrison the territory and establish administrative organs. The protectorate is bound by the German Customs Union. At the same time, the German government can promulgate laws and take measures to maintain security and order. As a result of these actions, the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia can now be said to be complete." Halifax then discussed Germany's reasons for defending its actions, saying, "I cannot believe that the sudden decision of some Slovak leaders to secede from Czechoslovakia was not instigated by external forces." After briefly recounting the facts, he said, "We cannot help but conclude that all the conflicts before Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia were

Premeditated

The letter from the German President to the Czech President persuading his people to surrender is not worth discussing. Judging from the situation at the time, the Czech President was on his way to Berlin, and Czech territory had already been occupied by German troops. Intelligent people will easily come to the conclusion that the so-called negotiations were just a smokescreen. It is even possible that Germany used force to intimidate and issued an ultimatum to Czechoslovakia. The Czech authorities, in order to save their people from rapid destruction by aircraft, had no choice but to submit." He also said that Germany's claim that Czechoslovakia's existence posed a threat to Germany was simply not credible to everyone. "I believe that the actual situation is that Germany's strength is superior to that of Czechoslovakia, and it is acting unilaterally, taking itself as the supreme arbiter. Under these circumstances, the British government believes that immediate action is necessary." When he mentioned the suspension of the visit to Germany by Secretary of Commerce Stanley and Minister for Overseas Trade Hudson, he said, "This is the government's intervention in the informal contact between the industrial and commercial sectors of the two countries. We believe that under such circumstances,

There is no Point in Talking About

Promoting cooperation between the two countries. Therefore, all such matters are indefinitely postponed." He then discussed the recall of Ambassador to Germany Henderson, saying, "I believe that we have made the British government's attitude fully clear to the German government, and although we cannot hope that our protest to Germany will have any great effect, this move is perfectly justified." He continued to discuss German figures using the historical development of the British Empire to justify their actions today, saying, "The principles on which the British Empire is based are self-governance. Everything we have done has left traces of freedom and autonomy. Our past actions have never suppressed freedom. We certainly acknowledge that Germany has more interests in Southeastern Europe than we do, but this cannot be compared with the use of force, in violation of international law, to oppress an independent country." Referring to the opposition party's claim that Chamberlain's policy in Munich was his personal policy, he said, "If this refers to the policy being formulated by the Prime Minister with his

Full Energy

Ideals and determination, I will not object. But if it is said that the policy has not obtained the full cooperation of myself and other cabinet members, then I will solemnly object." When the Foreign Secretary made this statement, government parliamentarians applauded. Some members of the House of Commons also cheered from the gallery. He continued, "The purpose of the Munich Agreement was twofold. First, in the extremely difficult circumstances at the time, to seek a fair solution as much as possible, because the problem was real, and if we wanted to maintain peace in Europe, urgent measures had to be taken. Under the circumstances and information available at the time, I have no doubt that the government took this measure. Second, it was to use the method of free negotiations to guarantee the security of the people of Europe and to lay the foundation for resolving future disputes. But based on what we have seen, this purpose has already been destroyed by the current situation." Regarding the general public's criticism of Britain for

Unwarranted Trust

In Germany's assurances, he said that neither the Prime Minister nor himself had ever forgotten the stark difference between believing and hoping. "But we have always believed that belief is born of prolonged hope." He then discussed Hitler's actions, saying, "Before the Munich Agreement, Hitler still adhered to his own creed, that is, to expel non-Germans from Germany. But now he has broken this principle, because he has now annexed eight million Czechs, which is clearly contrary to his inherent philosophy." He then recalled that in September of last year, Hitler insisted on the principle of national self-determination, claiming that this was the foundation of Germany's entire attitude, but that some facts were far from this principle. "However, let us not discuss whether the treatment of 250,000 Germans is reasonable, but now eight million Czechs are enslaved. But this cannot be regarded as a remedy. Will we believe that Germany will again adopt a new policy

Attempt to Rule

Non-Germans? This serious question has been raised all over the world. The occupation of Czechoslovakia was completed by this new method of further advancement. The world now sees a new division in the scope of international technology. Separatism in various countries has re-emerged. This is not only for the benefit of separatists but also for the benefit of the German Empire. This method is extremely simple and is progressing daily, and there is really no mistake. Can we guarantee that this will not happen elsewhere? Germany's neighboring countries are all in danger. Every independent and free country has received a warning of danger. I am very pleased that Romania has denied receiving an ultimatum, but it is not surprising that Romania and other countries have expressed serious concern about the events of the past few days." He spoke of the situation of aiding refugees, saying that the government will continue to make every effort to alleviate all the results of this incident, but regrettably, the success of all plans depends on the attitude of the German government. In the past few years, the British people have been eager to maintain

Friendly Relations

With the German people. Our people, because we do not insist on the mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles, are willing to remedy them. However, in the past few years, every opportunity for mutual adjustment that could be carried out has been obstructed by the actions of the government. Not long after the Munich Conference, the government took every measure that shocked the world. The German actions of last week have hindered every step of economic cooperation between the two countries. It is difficult to predict when it can be restored. The British government had no choice but to realize this event, so it is consulting with various autonomous territories and other national governments. Although there have been many times in history of

Domination of Europe

The results have been disastrous. If historical facts are a lesson, the Germans will eventually regret their actions in Czechoslovakia."

[Reuters, Rome, 20th] Romania's important commercial negotiations with Germany are extremely difficult. Political figures speculate that Romania is expected to conclude an agreement with the German economic delegation within this week. It is generally expected that the agreement will complete the German-Romanian business agreement concluded in November last year. It is said that according to the new agreement, the amount of goods exchanged between the two countries will increase. This increase is due to Germany's inability to pay with current funds. Germany will probably get more oil from Romania, either taken from oil fields, opened by Germany, or taken from existing oil fields. Well-informed sources believe that the attitude of this negotiation is nothing more than to promote business between the two friendly countries. At the same time, Romania's relations with Hungary are very friendly. The Romanian authorities have ordered the border guards to avoid conflicts with the Hungarian army.

### British Parties Gradually Unite, Opposition Supports Firm Stance, Labour MPs Question Czech Incident

[Reuters, London, 20th] Since Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham, parliamentary opinion has clearly changed this weekend. The opposition party's attitude of criticism has already changed. Today, when Chamberlain stepped into the House of Commons, opposition MPs also cheered him along with government MPs. At this time of difficulty, MPs of all parties and factions unanimously believe that Britain should adopt a firm stance. The government's action should naturally receive the support of the opposition party. There is no sign of cooperation between the Labour Party and the government party, but there are no more opposition MPs who are able to say that Chamberlain must step down.

[Reuters, London, 20th] At the meeting of the House of Commons today, Labour MP Mr. Peng asked, "In view of the fact that Germany has forcibly occupied all the Czech military raw materials and factories, does the Prime Minister intend to revise the national defense plan?" Chamberlain said that in his speech on March 10, he mentioned that national life must be considered from the perspective of national security, which of course includes the national defense plan. Labour MP Ms. Wilkinson asked whether this included submitting a ban on the sale of pig iron and scrap iron to Germany to the British Iron and Steel Association, as was done last year. The Prime Minister replied that this can also be called a part of national life. The Prime Minister also said in response to another question that, to his personal knowledge, before the Czech President accepted Hitler's conditions on March 15, he had not received a written ultimatum. British Ambassador to Germany Henderson received instructions on March 17 to notify the German government that Britain was willing to bluntly express to Germany that it believed that the events of the past few days had not only completely destroyed the Munich Agreement but also denied the spirit of peace resolution through consensus of negotiators. The British Ambassador also received instructions to protest to Germany the use of force to change Czechoslovakia, believing that this action, no matter what legal point of view, was unfounded. There was also a question asking whether the Prime Minister had witnessed the report published in the newspaper that Hitler threatened to bomb Prague to force the Czech President to accept his demands. The Prime Minister gave an affirmative answer. He said, "The British government is still studying the entire situation in Czechoslovakia."

### Italian Ambassador to Germany Summoned Home, Carries Letter from Hitler

[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] The Italian ambassador was recently summoned home to report to Mussolini. He did not leave this publicly. Newspapers also did not publish the news of his return home. It is understood that he carried a handwritten letter from Hitler to Mussolini.

### US-German Relations May Be Severed, Strongly Protests Occupation of Czechoslovakia, Condemns Violation of International Law

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] Today, the State Department officially notified the German Embassy that it does not recognize the German occupation of Czechoslovakia.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] Official news, the US government has lodged a protest with the German Embassy in the United States. The wording is unprecedentedly strong. Some parties indicated that this protest may lead to the severance of US-German diplomatic relations. It is reported that the US protest letter condemns Germany's invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia as violating international law and threatening world peace.

[Associated Press, Washington, 20th] The US State Department yesterday instructed its minister to Czechoslovakia, Mr. Karl, to close the embassy in Prague. The status of American diplomatic personnel in that area will be reduced to consul general.

### Romanian-German Trade Agreement to Be Renegotiated

[Reuters, Rome, Daily] Romania and Germany will sign a limited trade agreement this Wednesday. The agreement will be an extension of the existing agreements between the two countries. It is said that the crude oil supplied by Romania to Germany is only a small part and has little to do with the original requirements.

Short Commentary

### A Salute to Overseas Chinese Returning Home to Serve the Country

Yesterday's evening newspaper reported that the team of technical personnel organized by overseas Chinese in Jicheng, Nanyang, had arrived in Hong Kong a few days ago, and that 208 members of the Singapore Overseas Chinese National Salvation Team had returned to the country to serve, had safely arrived in Saigon, and would enter Guangxi and Yunnan from Saigon via Hanoi in batches on the 18th, 19th, and 2nd to serve in various industries. These news make us feel an immeasurable joy and excitement!

The War of Resistance is rapidly entering the second stage. If we cannot quickly strengthen the combat effectiveness of the front line, develop guerrilla warfare behind the enemy lines, and cultivate new forces in the rear, then not only will we not be able to achieve the ultimate victory in the struggle and obtain the final victory, but we will also not be able to stop the unlimited incursion and will not be able to save the nation from final demise. If we want to accurately and quickly complete the above three urgent tasks, we must first implement the general spiritual mobilization of the national people and the general mobilization of all the living forces of the entire Chinese nation. However, in view of the tragic massacre and trampling of domestic compatriots in the 20-odd months of the War of Resistance and the great loss of vitality, as well as the impossibility of achieving the launch and realization of the latent forces of domestic compatriots in one day or one night, what is hoped of our overseas Chinese compatriots is of utmost importance and urgency. Our overseas Chinese compatriots have a particularly strong national consciousness and bear the glorious tradition of helping the motherland. At this time when the motherland has entered a critical stage in the struggle for independence and freedom, it is hoped that our overseas Chinese will promote self-esteem and self-confidence and enthusiastically come to serve!

Therefore, in addition to offering here the most sublime and intimate national revolutionary salute to the overseas Chinese who have already returned to the country to serve, on the one hand, we also hope that the overseas public opinion circles and educational circles will encourage overseas Chinese, and on the other hand, we hope that the government will quickly determine the overall plan and give special rewards to overseas Chinese who return to the country to serve. At the same time, there are things that we cannot help but say: First, according to the actual situation described in communications from various parts of the country, we hope that the government will earnestly guarantee the freedom of the national salvation movement under centralized leadership, and that the speeches and actions of all parties, prejudices, stubborn elements, and latent compromisers and pro-Japanese elements that hinder the national salvation movement should be thoroughly cleaned up. Second, there are still many overseas Chinese and youths in Hong Kong, Macao, and other special areas who are unaware of the shame of national subjugation, indulge in extravagant and romantic decadent lives, and even have national traitors who evade national law, spread rumors and fallacies, and promote Japan and undermine our country's united resistance. This kind of scum, traitors, and collaborators are really a disgrace to the glorious history of our overseas Chinese. The latter is forbidden by national laws and human morality, and the former is also intolerable by overseas Chinese with conscience and backbone. We must at least use the power of public opinion to sanction them.

### Weaknesses of the Japanese Army

—Shi Chang

Translated from Pravda, Moscow

Judging from the form of Japanese operations in China, the Japanese army's actions are very mechanized. Its main forces are often concentrated at a designated location. The Japanese army is more accustomed to taking encirclement actions and rarely takes direct frontal assault tactics to force the Chinese army to withdraw from its inherent territories. Most of the Japanese army has undergone rigorous training, especially in tactics of attack and night raid. Mechanized units and cavalry units can travel 25 miles a day, and infantry units can also travel 18 miles a day.

However, the Japanese army is not good at face-to-face melee warfare. On the contrary, everyone knows that the Chinese army is good at melee combat. When the Japanese and Chinese armies approach, they cannot withstand the Chinese army's bayonets. To cite an example: In the battle between the Japanese and Chinese armies in Bazhi, Yining, in the middle of last year, on both sides of the canal, this was a very intense war. The forces of both sides were very close. Except for broadswords and bayonets, other military instruments lost their effectiveness. Therefore, shortly after the start of the war, the Japanese army could not hold on and retreated, with more than 2,000 killed and injured.

The Japanese army dispatched to China has tanks, aircraft, and engineering teams. In terms of military equipment, the Chinese army is far inferior to the Japanese army. However, the Chinese army does not lose heart and shows an excellent spirit of brave resistance. Giving a serious blow to the "Imperial Army"!

The Japanese commanders underestimated the strength of the Chinese army. They believed that the Chinese army was poorly equipped and poorly trained and would never be able to cope with scientific modern warfare. This caused a major strategic mistake. Now the number of Japanese troops stationed in the occupied areas of China is insufficient and they are always vulnerable to Chinese army attacks. The Japanese army is also well aware of this, but its strength is weak and there are not enough troops to allocate. Even in important transportation lines, only a small number of troops can be stationed. The Japanese army's rear defense is also not complete and appropriate. Japanese commanders often declare "victory" and the domestic chaebols echo each other," holding celebrations, etc. This is just a comforting," deceiving the country and deceiving themselves. In essence, the real situation has reached a dangerous period.

How many troops can Japan mobilize? Opinions differ from all parties, and the estimates of foreign newspapers also vary. According to statistics from China, Britain, and France, as of December 31, 1938, the Japanese army included 1.2 million troops, 4,500 cannons, 1,800 tanks, and 2,000 aircraft. This is a more reliable statistic.

Eighty percent of the Japanese army is drawn from the civilian class, while most of the officers are professional soldiers, landlords, and wealthy people. In this Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese army fully demonstrated a despicable and low morality. The killings, robberies, rapes, and other misconduct in the occupied areas are ironclad evidence of the Japanese army's lack of discipline and lack of good morals.

In foreign newspapers, we can often see reports of anti-war sentiments in the Japanese army. In reality, the anti-war sentiments in the Japanese army are very high. Often, some small units refuse to obey orders to go to the front line. Of course, after these rebellious troops are discovered, they are immediately shot. In Shanghai and Nanjing, several batches of soldiers have been escorted to the rear for punishment because of "rebellious" activities. Many Japanese soldiers have been demoted as a result of such incidents. Japanese naval officers often encounter many difficulties due to the refusal of their subordinates to obey orders.

In Japan, many people often pretend to be sick or suddenly disappear to avoid participating in military service. In Kyushu, a group of people were forcibly conscripted into the reserves, but they were all opposed to the war, and therefore, rebellions and suicides occurred everywhere. People forced to join the army and armed to fight drink strong alcohol and smoke opium in order to temporarily forget the war.

In reality, we can foresee that as the war prolongs day by day, the morale of the Japanese people and the spirit of the Japanese army will greatly decline.

### Amidst Tensions in Europe, Hong Kong's Defenses Are Further Strengthened; Commander of the Army, General McNair, Will Visit the Governor of Australia in Australia; 550 British Troops Arrived in Hong Kong on a Ship Yesterday Morning to Reinforce Defenses

Hitler tore up the Munich Agreement and openly announced the annexation of Czechoslovakia, and even moved his troops eastward. The winds of Europe suddenly became tense. The British government is always concerned about the defense of Hong Kong. In order to cope with this dangerous situation, the Hong Kong authorities are also actively reorganizing their military forces and preparing for self-defense. In recent years, the defense strength of the army, navy, and air force has greatly increased through hard work. Everything is prepared for wartime, which is enough to resist any foreign aggression with surplus.

Army Commander Scheduled to Visit the Governor of Australia

In order to protect the safety of Hong Kong, the military authorities, in addition to actively strengthening military equipment, are also conducting liaison with neighboring friendly countries. The two countries of Annam and Siam, which are slightly farther away from Hong Kong, and the Portuguese colony of Macau, which is nearby, have recently been constantly employing commissioners to consolidate diplomatic relations, so as to form a unified force with the Singapore military port, so as to be able to respond to each other in times of trouble. A few months ago, British Navy Commander-in-Chief in China, Nobel, visited the authorities of Siam and Australia one after another, bearing heavy responsibilities, and its intentions were also very significant. According to official sources, the British Army Commander-in-Chief in China, Major General McNair, will also take a ship to visit the Governor of Australia. The date has been set for April 6. Brigadier Thomson will be traveling with him. It is said that McNair's trip also bears a liaison mission. Hong Kong sincerely believes that Australia is geographically dependent on each other, and Macau is adjacent to our Zhongshan. It contains a great role in military measures. In addition, the Governor of Macau, Sir Barbosa, will return to Portugal recently to ask for instructions. He will stay in Lisbon for a short time before returning to Macau to take office. However, the trip to Portugal will be after General McNair's visit to Australia.

550 British Troops Arrived by Ship Yesterday

The British government's active military deployment in Hong Kong and liaison with neighboring friendly countries is as mentioned above. At the same time, the number of ships stationed in Hong Kong and the number of soldiers are also increasing from time to time, so that Hong Kong's defenses can reach the state of being impregnable. Recently, dozens of army officers and 550 British navy personnel were sent from there to reinforce Hong Kong on the transport ship Lancashire. The ship arrived at 6:30 yesterday morning and was berthed in the sea opposite the naval dockyard. After this batch of soldiers arrived in Hong Kong, they landed one after another and entered a military camp. The military appearance was very grand. It was also found that after this batch of British troops arrived in Hong Kong, a large number of British troops will be coming soon. Once the army barracks on Prince Edward Road in Sham Shui Po are completed, this batch of British troops can be transferred in batches. Although the authorities have not formally announced the future increase in the number of army and navy soldiers in Hong Kong, it is generally estimated to be between four and six brigades.

Three Major Forts Conduct Live-Fire Exercises

The eastern and western forts in Hong Kong have been ordered by the authorities for the past ten days to conduct live-fire shooting to become proficient. The West Fort of Yizhou and the Fort of Drunkard's Cap conducted artillery exercises at the same time the day before yesterday (20th). The White Sand Bay Fort is scheduled to conduct exercises in Area A from 6:00 am to 12:00 pm on the 23rd of tomorrow. (3) During the exercise period, all large and small ships should be careful to avoid approaching that area. In addition, the Army Headquarters held a gas exercise from 4:00 pm to 5:30 pm yesterday. Army Commander-in-Chief McNair personally arrived at the scene. The British Army Brigade stationed in Hong Kong was also ordered to send personnel to participate. The results of the exercise were very satisfactory.

### × Vessel Coastal Search and Seizure of Grain - Three Cargo Boats Engage in Desperate Battle with × - × Cannon Fire Aboard Vessel Causes Fire, Multiple × Soldiers Knocked into the Sea

In recent days, × warships have repeatedly confiscated licenses from fishing boats setting out to sea.

The remaining × forces entrenched in Guangzhou, due to supply difficulties, face dwindling food supplies, leading to a recent food panic, with people living in constant anxiety. Furthermore, many × soldiers, having been away from their homeland for a long time, are weary of war and yearn for home. × Chieftains, fearing the dispersal of their troops, falsely declared to the soldiers that reinforcements were arriving and that food supplies would be replenished. Recently, they have resorted to forcibly arming fishing boats and directing them to search and purchase grain from our cargo boats along the coast to meet their needs. However, the gains are limited, like a cup of water trying to extinguish a burning cart of firewood, and have little effect.

Three Cargo Boats Near the Harbor Bomb and Sink One × Boat

According to a fisherman who returned to port and reported to the Fishermen's Association, his boat set out from Shau Kei Wan on the evening of the 15th of this month to fish. The next day at noon, while sailing in the waters near the Guangdong sea boundary, they spotted four armed × fishing boats chasing three cargo boats, intending to search and seize rice. The × boats fired warning shots along the way, ordering them to stop. The three cargo boats, with resistance as their only hope, devised a plan of "breaking the cauldrons and sinking the boats," preparing for a desperate battle with the ×. When the × boats approached, the three cargo boats remained calm and quickly fired several volleys of fishing cannons at the ×. One × boat was unable to dodge in time and was immediately hit, catching fire and being completely shattered. Several × soldiers perished in the flames. The remaining three × boats, intending to retaliate, fired several volleys at the three cargo boats, but missed. The three cargo boats calmly fought back, retreating while battling, eventually exhausting the × ammunition. Unable to achieve their goal, the × boats retreated in defeat. The three cargo boats also dared not pursue them. As a result of the battle, the three cargo boats suffered no losses and sailed away safely.

Cargo Boats Burned and Plundered - Fishing Boats' Licenses Confiscated

Furthermore, according to a report received by the Fishermen's Association yesterday, several fishing boats, in a group, were fishing near Daigan Island. At noon on the 17th, while they were fishing, they suddenly heard the sound of gunfire. Fearing an accident, they quickly raised their sails and fled. After reaching a safe location, they used binoculars to observe from afar and witnessed two cargo boats being intercepted by several × rubber boats firing shots. The cargo boats resisted, and there was an exchange of fire for about half an hour. The cargo boats, unable to withstand the attack, retreated hastily. The × soldiers relentlessly pursued them. The two cargo boats, being chased by the × boats, fled for their lives. One of them was unfortunately captured by the ×. The × first moved all the grain from the cargo boat onto their rubber boats, threw all the crew members into the sea, and then set fire to the boat before leaving with a whoop. In addition, the association has received repeated reports from fishermen returning to port in recent days stating that whenever they encounter × warships, their boat licenses are always taken away, but they are not otherwise harmed. It is suspected that the × are attempting to impersonate Hong Kong registered fishing boats to come and go in this port, in order to deceive and confuse.

### Hong Kong Finance Committee to Meet Tomorrow - To Discuss Supplementary Government Expenditure Budget - Proposed Additional Appropriation of Over Four Hundred and Fourteen Thousand Dollars

The total is $414,145.

### Firewood from the New Territories - Increasing Numbers Transported to Hong Kong for Sale - Multiple Trucks Transporting in Rotation Daily - Low Prices Allow Firewood Vendors to Reap Substantial Profits

The supply of firewood in Hong Kong is extremely large. A month ago, due to the impact of the current situation, the source was reduced, which caused a firewood shortage in Hong Kong. Although firewood merchants worked hard to purchase large quantities of firewood from Mouzhou and the Philippines and transport it to Hong Kong for supply, the firewood shortage gradually subsided. However, even now, the aftereffects still linger, and the price of firewood is the highest it has been in many years. It was found that when the firewood shortage first occurred, the villagers in the New Territories considered it an opportunity to profit, and they transported a large amount of firewood from the New Territories to Hong Kong for sale. Every day, groups of people carried firewood to Hong Kong in an endless stream. Because the price was much cheaper than Po Chai or Wu Chai firewood, the residents of the peninsula eagerly purchased it. Therefore, every day, villagers carried firewood to vacant lots in Kowloon City, Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, and Sham Shui Po to display and sell it, and it was sold out in an instant. For several months, this kind of business by the villagers has never stopped. Because of the lure of profit, people were paying attention to it, and firewood merchants took money to the New Territories to collect various types of firewood, hiring trucks to transport it back to Hong Kong for sale, making huge profits. The number of firewood merchants engaged in this business has greatly increased. Currently, there are six or seven trucks that are hired by firewood merchants every day to transport firewood from the New Territories to Hong Kong in rotation. The minimum daily quantity is estimated to be around 1400-1500 piculs. Furthermore, the villagers in the Chinese territory have also begun to cut down a large amount of mountain grass and new firewood to supply to the firewood merchants in Hong Kong who come to the New Territories to collect it. Therefore, the sales of firewood from the New Territories to Hong Kong are increasing daily. This should greatly assist the supply of firewood in Hong Kong. Moreover, the price of this firewood is lower than that of Po Chai or pine firewood. It is only six or seven Hong Kong cents per picul when purchased locally in the New Territories. After adding a few cents for transportation and selling it in Hong Kong for one dollar and twenty or thirty cents per picul, a profit of more than 50% can be made. It is foreseeable that firewood merchants will increasingly flock to this route to seek a source of firewood.

### True Light Performance "Long Live China" - On the 24th at the YMCA - Hong Kong True Light Middle School Senior Year

The senior students of Hong Kong True Light Middle School will hold a patriotic drama performance at 7:00 PM on the 24th of this month (Friday) at the YMCA Hall on Bridges Street. The script is "Long Live China" by Tang Na. All people from all walks of life are welcome to visit. It is also heard that tickets have been sent to the Living Bookstore, Zhengzhong Bookstore, YMCA, Da Sun Company, China Department Store, Mei Mei Company, and the Women's Comfort Association, etc., for distribution.

### Rumor that the Central Government has Approved - Tax-Free Import of Foreign Rice - Quota Set at 1.2 Million Hectoliters - Allocated to the Chaoshan Area

In the past half-month, the rice shortage in various counties of Guangdong has been severe, and fellow villagers from various counties in Hong Kong have been seeking relief. They have also urgently requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt foreign rice from import duties. However, purchasing foreign rice damages foreign exchange, which is not as good as purchasing domestic rice. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has telegraphed this intention back to the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce. Under these circumstances, whether the request for tax-free import of foreign rice can achieve its purpose is a matter of concern for those who must eat the rice of the Cantonese people. According to reliable sources, the Central Ministry of Finance, considering that the rice shortage in Guangdong Province is indeed severe and that it is not easy to purchase domestic rice at the moment, has adopted expedient measures, approving the import of 1.2 million hectoliters of tax-free foreign rice to Guangdong Province for emergency relief. Of this 1.2 million hectoliters, 700,000 hectoliters will be allocated to the Chaoshan area, and 200,000 hectoliters to the Jiangmen area. There is currently no news regarding the request from the Zhongshan area. The Ministry of Finance has instructed the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance to send personnel to investigate. Wu Tiecheng and Li Xiangen, important officials from the Zhongshan County Hostel, are currently working on this matter and it is expected that there will be a satisfactory outcome in the future. It has been found that various regional organizations in Hong Kong related to this matter, such as the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce, the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce, the Siyi Chamber of Commerce, the Qushan Chamber of Commerce, and the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce, have not received formal approvals. Rice merchants in Hong Kong are currently paying close attention. Recently, due to the urgent requests from various counties for tax-free import of foreign rice, rice merchants in Hong Kong have been purchasing and transporting rice from Annam to Hong Kong to prepare for the market. In the past three or four days, many rice ships have arrived in Hong Kong, and domestic rice has been arriving steadily, causing rice prices to drop slightly.

### Macao Authorities Seek to Improve Foreign Trade - Deeply Hope Hong Kong Merchants will go to Macao to Develop Industries - Macao Chinese Representative Sent a Letter of Greetings Yesterday - The Factory Federation will Send an Inspection Team

In order to improve local foreign trade and develop industry and commerce, Dr. Barbosa, the Governor of Macao, is very eager to cooperate with the Hong Kong industrial community. Liang Houyuan, the Macao Chinese representative, recently sent a letter to the Hong Kong Federation of Manufacturers, inviting them to send an inspection team to Macao to conduct on-site research as a basis for discussing cooperation. The Factory Federation has expressed acceptance of Mr. Liang's proposal and has scheduled a meeting for this Wednesday to discuss the trip to Macao. It is expected that preparations can be completed by the middle of next month. The reclamation project in the Nam Van area of Macao has been completed. The following is the letter from Mr. Liang: "Dear Sirs, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, people have been displaced and flocked to Hong Kong and Macao, waiting to be fed. More than 10,000 helpless refugees have been left in Macao. Although the overseas Chinese have tried their best to donate, it is still difficult to provide sufficient relief. Moreover, the long-term war of resistance is underway, and the refugees must rely on long-term relief. The overseas Chinese businessmen in Macao have seen this and planned to revive and develop industries, using work as a form of relief, and the Macao government has expressed sympathy and agreed to support and increase convenience. Moreover, products sold to Portuguese territories can enjoy preferential tax rates, and Mr. Jia Liren, the general manager of the British Power and Light Company in Macao, has also expressed his willingness to assist. I think that the friendship between friendly countries is so benevolent, and our compatriots should work even harder. We are currently soliciting opinions on the direction of the industry, but we have limited knowledge and the building may not be supported by a single beam. We have always admired your association for bringing together industry giants from home and abroad, with rich experience and wise planning. You will certainly be able to provide guidance on this matter, and because it concerns the relief of our compatriots, we dare to send this letter, requesting that your association organize an inspection team to come and inspect, and provide detailed guidance to serve as a compass."

### Ardath Cigarettes - Large Quantities Shipped from England to Hong Kong

The Gehe Tobacco Company, the most famous tobacco company in our country, recently ordered a large batch of Ardath cigarettes from the Terry Packing Factory in London, which have arrived in Hong Kong. Both can and pack packaging are available. These cigarettes are shipped directly from London, with a fragrant and mellow aroma. All cans and packs have the London factory label, which is sufficient proof that they are not the same as those produced locally elsewhere. Those who have been smoking these cigarettes for a long time should understand. Each can of 50 cigarettes costs 50 cents, and each pack of 10 cigarettes costs 10 cents. Retail and wholesale are welcome.

Special Feature of this Newspaper

### Glad Tidings from the New Capital: An Interview with Principal Chen Bingquan

— Qi Zhuo

Li Yinglin, Wu Dingxin, and Chen Bingquan, the three university presidents, went to Chongqing to attend the Third National Education Conference, bringing back the new seedlings of education. Upon hearing the news, the reporter made a special trip to visit them yesterday, hoping to share the information with the readers. Although it was a pity that I could not meet Presidents Li and Wu as they were not at the school, Principal Chen Bingquan's eloquent talk was enough to make people rejoice.

(I) No Room for Doubt

First of all, the reporter inquired about the general situation in Chongqing and the central government that had not yet been published in the newspaper. Principal Chen said: During the conference, the central government made many important reports on the current situation of the war of resistance, some of which were military secrets and could not be made public. Premier Kong's report on borrowing from democratic countries and Minister Wang's analysis of diplomacy were both exciting. Minister He's report, based on precise figures, was especially encouraging and increased confidence that the war of resistance would surely achieve final victory. Wang's defection was purely a personal act and had no impact on the overall situation. From any point of view, it is gratifying to see that from top to bottom, everyone is working hard in a planned and step-by-step manner under a set national policy. Minister Chen is actively promoting the implementation of wartime education, and Peng Xuepei is also performing his duties. Rumors of resignation, detention, and other rumors are all conspiracies of × people to sow discord and are completely unfounded.

Principal Chen also solemnly said: In Hong Kong, some people may have some doubts about the war of resistance, thinking that some people may advocate peace. However, after personally arriving in Chongqing, one can suddenly believe that there is absolutely no room for doubt. Under the atmosphere of hard work to support the war of resistance, the future of the war of resistance is very optimistic.

(II) Solemnity Replaces Debauchery, Thrift Replaces Luxury

In the development of the overall national policy in a secure and methodical manner, the atmosphere of our wartime capital has also changed. This change in atmosphere is another guarantee of final victory.

The Three People's Principles Youth League is flourishing. The central government's love for and trust in young people, as well as the youth's support for the government and love for the leader, are all miracles created by the flames of the war of resistance and are infinitely inspiring!

Public officials are solemnly performing their duties and are strictly prohibited from entering entertainment venues. When it is necessary to host a banquet, the cost of each Chinese meal should not exceed eight yuan, and the cost of each Western meal should not exceed one yuan. The most interesting thing is the "buffet." A pottery utensil is divided into four compartments with bamboo strips, containing four dishes, plus soup, rice, and fruit, each serving costs only fifty cents. This time, Chairman Chiang and other officials hosted a banquet for the attending members, using such a "buffet."

——After listening to the reporter, I hope that the atmosphere of "prohibiting entry into entertainment venues" and "buffets" can be popularized among the middle-class and above in various parts of the rear, especially here in Hong Kong. Otherwise, it is too unfair to the soldiers who are fighting bloody battles and the compatriots who are displaced and wandering.

(III) A New Posture for the War of Resistance Education

The overall situation is improving, and education is also being addressed. At this National Education Conference, it was unanimously agreed that the curriculum should be adapted to the needs of wartime. The curriculum standards for all levels have also been reorganized and revised by a committee. Strengthening vocational education and cultivating useful technical talents is an urgent requirement. The Ministry of Education has entrusted various universities to run various specialized training classes, including accounting, statistics, electrical engineering, civil engineering, and other classes. High school graduates are recruited for two years of training and awarded appropriate jobs. Each class has 50 students, and the Ministry of Education subsidizes each class with 1,000 yuan in national currency per month. Twenty classes have already been opened with considerable success. Other regions and schools are also expanding their implementation.

In order to ensure the permanent development of education as the foundation of the country, an important resolution was passed at this conference: the central and local education funds should be increased by at least 10% each year. This is an important key to the rebirth of education.

Students and teachers who have lost their schooling or jobs are being dealt with in Chongqing in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education. Countless teachers and staff from the war zone have registered and been assigned to work. Currently, there are still 1,500 registered primary and secondary school teachers in Chongqing who are undergoing training, hosted by Tang Xifen, a supervisor and section chief of the Ministry of Education. After graduation, they will be assigned to various places to promote wartime compulsory education.

——We very much hope that the responsible authorities in various provinces and regions will earnestly implement the regulations promulgated by the central government, especially arranging for teachers and students properly.

In a private conversation between Minister Chen of Education and Principal Chen, there was a passage that deserves special attention from all schools:

"In addition to following the highest principles of the Three People's Principles education, each school at all levels of education should have its own characteristics. Whether it is literature, science, agriculture, engineering, commerce, medicine, or... each can develop its own specialties based on its school history and existing foundation. As for each student, they should be satisfied according to their family background, whether it is urban, rural, overseas Chinese, military..." "Students should be quiet, active, literary, martial... so that their personality can be developed normally." This is a very correct educational ideal; however, what specific measures can be taken to promote its realization? Principal Chen replied to the reporter: "For individual guidance to students, it is necessary to make good use of the mentor system." From this, we can once again see the importance of "sound faculty" in education.

(IV) A New Map

In Chongqing, there are many progressive publications. Principal Chen brought back this time the "Overall Situation Map of the Enemy and Us" compiled by the Political Department of the Military Commission, which is especially worthy of attention. In it, the areas occupied by × people are marked with dots without concealing their illness. There are also "Our Areas Where We Can Exercise Sovereignty" and "Our Complete Areas," which make it clear that the areas occupied by × people are not easy to become "lines"; the "points" that are temporarily lost are still countable. In the vast territory, for twenty months, many, many parts are still safe and sound. After looking at this map, it suddenly dawned on me that it is absolutely possible for our guerrillas and regular troops to attack the front and rear of the × people. And imagine how dangerous the fate of × people will be in the future! The reporter gladly borrowed the electrotype from Principal Chen, using real evidence to warn the general pessimistic defeatists. Unfortunately, the map is too large and very detailed. When making an electrotype, it must be very blurry, so the original plan to abandon it is a great pity! I heard that Principal Chen plans to submit it to the central government for approval to reprint it, and the reporter wishes him to realize this wish as soon as possible.

One piece of news that needs to be reported in passing is that Principal Chen and others are scheduled to invite principals of secondary schools in Hong Kong this Sunday to report on the experience of attending this meeting. The details of the education aspect in this article will be reported systematically next time.

### My Troops and the Enemy in the Dongjiang Area Are in a Tense Standoff × Suddenly Invade Boluo Lianhe × Loot and Burn Lianhe Before Retreating Immediately My Guerrilla Forces in the Dongjiang Area Have Increased Several Times Compared to Before

[Huiyang Express News] My counter-offensive military forces in the Eastern Route, after months of planning and deployment, have become increasingly strong. Since the enemy troops have increased their troops in Zengcheng Shilong Shili and other areas in the past ten days, they are also waiting for the opportunity to invade us. The situation of the current tense standoff between my troops and the enemy in the Dongjiang area is reported below based on information obtained by a certain military agency here:

Hundreds of Enemy Troops Suddenly Invade Boluo

It has been found that Longhua, Futian, Changning, and Lianhe, which are subordinate to Boluo County, are adjacent to Zengcheng, and the enemy troops often invade and harass them. On the 9th of last month, the enemy troops in Zengcheng Shilong, with more than 1,000 infantry and cavalry, invaded Longhua on a large scale in two routes, but were repelled by our troops. After that, the enemy also sent small numbers of troops to harass them from time to time, but they all failed. On the morning of the 15th, more than 400 enemy infantry and cavalry, accompanied by two artillery pieces, suddenly invaded Lianhe. At that time, the troops of the 3rd and ×th Guerrilla Brigades of Lin Junsheng, who were stationed there, joined forces with a certain unit of the defense forces to fight back. After a fierce battle of about two hours, the enemy used its superior artillery fire to bombard us fiercely. Our troops were forced to retreat temporarily due to the destruction of the positions, waiting for reinforcements to counterattack. After the enemy invaded Lianhe, they looted wantonly and set fire to the shops before retreating at noon. Before leaving, they also looted dozens of head of cattle. Before long, our reinforcements arrived, but the enemy had already retreated. In this battle, the enemy suffered dozens of casualties due to our resistance. Now Lianhe has been recaptured by our troops, and there is no trace of the enemy nearby.

Strengthen the Guerrilla Forces in the Dongjiang Area

In order to strengthen the guerrilla strength in the Eastern Route, to carry out extensive guerrilla warfare to annihilate and trap the enemy, and to facilitate our army's large-scale counter-offensive, Zhang Fakui, the commander of the Fourth War Area, summoned Luo Changxiang, the commander of the Third War Area Guerrilla Force, and Wang Ruozhou, the commander of the Fourth War Area, to a certain place in the North River to give them face-to-face instructions on various matters. According to continued news, Commander Zhang also ordered Zhang Ying's special service brigade of the Chao, Hui, and Hui prefectures of the Guangdong Pacification Office to develop the Huibo front line and be under the command of Luo Fengxiang, the commander of the Third Guerrilla Force. At the same time, the Huang and Yang units of the former Daya Bay Garrison Camp were also placed under the command of Commander Luo. Commander Luo then reorganized the two units into the Second and Third Independent Brigades and stationed them in the Luofu Mountain area. The guerrilla strength in the Dongjiang area has been strengthened several times compared to before.

Capture the Chairman of the Shilong Maintenance Association

According to Shenzhen Express News, the enemy troops entrenched in Shilong Wancheng have recently sent troops along the Guangjiu Railway and Wanzhang Highway to invade Chashan, Hengli, Liaobu, and other places. In order to strengthen the defense of the Guangjiu Railway, the Fourth War Area Guerrilla Headquarters ordered the Jin Kun unit of the Fourth Detachment to move to the Zhangmutou area to be on alert to prevent the enemy troops from advancing further. Luo's unit obeyed the order and arrived at the destination yesterday (20th) to deploy and be on guard. It was also found that the enemy troops in the Dongjiang area had recently instigated a large number of traitors to infiltrate various counties in Dongbin and Huibo to gather military intelligence and induce various villages to establish puppet organizations. Lun Zhonglian, the former chairman of the puppet maintenance association in Shilong, secretly arrived in Tangtouxia, with ulterior motives. The matter was detected by the intelligence team of the Jin Kun unit, and Lun was captured in a certain shop in Tangtouxia yesterday afternoon and taken back to the Fourth War Area Guerrilla Headquarters for interrogation.

### The Situation in Rongqi Remains Tense The Enemy Invades Shatou from Daliang My Strength in Rongqi is Strong Gu Dinghua Investigates Senior Officers Who Retreat Without Authorization

[Rongqi Express News] After Daliang fell to the enemy again and the teams retreated to Rongqi, the situation became tense. At the same time, the enemy deployed fortifications around the county seat of Daliang, and established puppet organizations. Traitors Liang Tianlu was appointed as the puppet county magistrate, and Liang Yongxin was appointed as the puppet police chief. Absurd announcements were issued to lure county residents back to the county to work. On the one hand, traitors were recruited to attract unscrupulous businessmen to operate gambling and opium dens. All of these are clear evidence of the intention to occupy the area for a long time. Rongqi and Daliang are very close to each other. The situation of the enemy and us in the two places can be known as follows:

The Enemy Occupies the Sugar Factory and Engages in Fierce Battles Across the River

It was found that the Rongqi section of the Zhongshun Highway (formerly known as the Rongliang Highway, which was a mistake) runs from Daliang to Shatou, but cannot directly reach Rongqi because Shatou and Rongqi are separated by a narrow strip of water. When our teams withdrew from Daliang, they crossed the river to Rongqi because there was no defense along the Rongliang Road. Fortunately, the 5th Detachment of Yuan Dai's 1st Mobile Brigade of the 1st Guerrilla Area was stationed in Rongqi, and the enemy could not advance further. However, the enemy sent troops from Daliang to station in Shatou across the sea on the 17th of this month, and remotely controlled Rongqi from the Shatou Sugar Factory. Although the enemy in Daliang has not launched an invasion, the situation in Rongqi has not eased slightly. On the 17th, the enemy once fired small cannons and machine guns at Rongqi across the river, and our troops fought back, exchanging fire for more than ten minutes before stopping. On the 18th, they bombarded again, and we guarded our positions strictly to prevent them from crossing the river. As of the 19th, the enemy had no intention of approaching further.

Teams Strengthen Defenses and Thoroughly Investigate Dereliction of Duty

Currently, the teams concentrated in Rongqi, in addition to those who withdrew from Daliang, Yuan Dai, the commander of the First Mobile Brigade, had already transferred a large team from Xiaolan, led by Chief of Staff Qu Renzhe, to Rongqi to strengthen the defenses. On the 19th of this month, Commander Yuan personally led the team from Xiaolan to garrison Rongqi. The other teams in Shun also arrived one after another, with strong strength. They can attack or defend, and there is no need to worry about defense. In addition to commanding the defense, Gu Dinghua, the administrative commissioner of the First War Area, also began to investigate whether the commanding officers of the teams in charge when Daliang fell had retreated without authorization, resulting in a lack of leadership of the troops and the inability to fully exert their resistance. He will report to his superiors and thoroughly investigate the dereliction of duty. It is said that Vice Commander Lu Ling took the self-provided steamship "Youde" to a certain place on the night of the fall of Daliang and has not yet returned to the team.

Rongqi Imposes Martial Law and the Ferries Are Packed

Martial law has been declared in Rongqi, and the public security is very good. Because the enemy troops are only a river away, the teams strictly prohibit boats from berthing on the shore. However, the Xinheli Ferry from Shiqi to Rongqi and the Xingji Ferry from Jiangmen to Rongqi are allowed to operate as usual due to transportation reasons. However, each ferry must be moored halfway overnight when returning to Rongqi at night, and then sail to Rongqi to unload passengers and goods in the morning. The people in Rongqi, Guizhou, and nearby villages are automatically evacuated, and many go to Zhongshan and Xinhui temporarily. The ferries departing from Rongqi have been extremely crowded with passengers in recent days.

### After the Fall of Daliang, the Siyi Strengthen Their Defense Forces Adjustments are Made to Finance, Transportation, Food, and Other Items The Central Government Approves the Exemption of Rice Tax for 10,000 Bags per County

[Jiangmen Express News] Since the fall of Guangdong [Jiangmen Express News], the situation in Siyi has changed. The enemy troops have occupied Jiujiang Heqing, and recently captured Shunde Tianliang. They have repeatedly attempted to invade Siyi. Now Siyi has stepped up the mobilization of the people, and Li Wuzi, the commander of the Fifth War Area Column, has increased the number of guerrilla teams to strengthen the defense forces of Siyi. The important progress of the wartime finance, transportation, and food in Siyi recently is recorded as follows:

Organize Finance and Prohibit Discounts on National Currency

Currently, the ratio of national currency to fractional currency in Taishan, Kaiping, Xinhui, and Enping counties has long been set by the Ministry of Finance at 1:44. However, since the fall of Guangzhou, the number of people in Siyi has increased sharply. At the same time, the circulation of national currency in Siyi has become more prosperous. Most shops have switched to using national currency as the standard, but some unscrupulous merchants have secretly discounted the national currency, especially discriminating against Farmers Bank banknotes, which should be strictly prohibited to maintain wartime finance. The counties have issued announcements prohibiting this. If it is found that the national currency is being discounted in the future, the crime will be treated as treason.

The Water and Land Transportation Situation in Various Counties

After Daliang in Shunde was attacked and occupied by the enemy again, the situation in Jiangmen also became tense. After the Daxingye and Lihe electric ferries sailing between Sanbu and Macau were robbed in Luzhou, the water and land transportation in Siyi was even more affected. In order to regulate the wartime transportation in Siyi, the Fifth War Area Column Headquarters established a wartime shipping cooperative to organize the water transportation in Siyi. After the ferry from Jiangmen to Rongqi was suspended a few days ago, it has now resumed operation. The other ferries from Jiangmen to Sanbu and from Sanbu to Macau are operating as usual. The roads in the counties of Siyi have been thoroughly destroyed due to the recent tense situation, and the work has been unusually busy in recent days.

Tax-Exempt Foreign Rice is Imported in a Steady Stream

The price of rice in Siyi has soared, affecting the people's food. A few days ago, Gu Dinghua, the administrative commissioner of the First War Area, convened a meeting of county magistrates and decided on measures to relieve the food situation in the counties, and requested the central government to approve the exemption of foreign rice tax. Now the central government has approved the exemption of import tax for 10,000 bags of foreign rice per county in the First War Area. Now the chambers of commerce of Xinhui, Kaiping, Taishan, and Enping counties have convened rice merchants to discuss the import of foreign rice. Therefore, tax-exempt foreign rice in Siyi has been steadily imported in recent days, and the price of rice has gradually declined.

### The Rice Shortage in Xijiang is Resolved Guizhou Rice Relaxes Export Ban Strictly Investigate Traitor Smuggling The Price of Rice May Gradually Decline

[Zhaoqing Express News] Recently, due to the transition between the old and new crops in Xijiang, and the enemy troops instigating traitors to smuggle exports and good merchants taking the opportunity to manipulate, the price of grain has skyrocketed. Medium-grade rice costs about six catties per yuan, and lower-grade rice costs only six and a half catties. The poor people are crying out in pain, and the social food order is also affected. Li Leifu, the administrative commissioner of the Third War Area, in order to find a way to relieve the situation, in addition to actively encouraging increased production and strictly investigating traitor smuggling, also submitted a request to the provincial government to consult with the Guizhou provincial authorities to relax the ban on rice exports in order to adjust the situation. Chairman Li is concerned about the people's livelihoods, and has approved it. The Guizhou provincial authorities also believe that Guangdong and Guizhou are closely related, and that food should be mutually adjusted and supplied during the war of resistance. They have ordered Wuzhou and other places to allow the export of grain and rice. Now the county governments and business groups in Xijiang have sent people to Guizhou to purchase in order to solve this serious food problem. It is expected that a large number of yesterday's rice will be on the market in the daytime, and the price of rice may gradually decline.

### A Certain Military Officer Talks About My Counter-Offensive in Guangzhou With Great Confidence My Newly Equipped Army and Air Force Strength is Enough to Control the Enemy The Enemy Wants to Take Advantage of My Undecided Deployment to Shake My People's Hearts

[Shaoguan Express News] The news of my army's counter-offensive in Guangzhou has been circulating in newspapers for a long time. Yesterday, a reporter visited a certain military officer and asked about the recent deployment of the military for the counter-offensive in Guangzhou. He gave the following detailed account: (1) Since the central military authorities sent personnel to the south for the military of the counter-offensive in Guangzhou, several emergency military meetings have been held in a certain place in northern Guangdong, and a high-level general meeting has been held in a certain place in Guilin. However, the reason why it has not become a reality immediately is that the deployment of each line takes time. The enemy and traitors are using this opportunity to spread rumors to all parties, saying that my army in Guangzhou is no longer able to recover it, hoping to shake my army's and people's belief in the war of resistance. However, they do not know that the three lines in the east, west, and north have gathered hundreds of thousands of troops, all equipped with the latest weapons, whose quality and quantity can be compared with those of the enemy, and are sufficient to control them. (2) My military officers have been ordered to go to the front line to take charge of the command of each route. Each officer is a famous general with both wisdom and courage, who has fought with the enemy again and again, winning victory after victory. The soldiers of each division and regiment have also been replenished and adjusted, and their strength has increased more than twenty times compared to before. (3) My army and air force, which have been ordered to participate in the counter-offensive in Guangzhou, have newly transferred more than a dozen air force teams to the air force and assigned them to certain airfields in a certain line. There are also more than a dozen special squadrons of heavy bomber aircraft. In terms of the army, five major teams of tanks, one major team of amphibious vehicles, and more than a dozen squadrons of the most elite mechanized units have been newly transferred to Guangdong. (4) The entire plan for my counter-offensive in Guangzhou has been issued by the supreme commander to a certain military commander. After another high-level officer meeting, the various steps of the counter-offensive can be distributed. Therefore, there is great confidence in the counter-offensive in Guangzhou in the shortest possible time.

### The Investigation of the Disaster Situation in Haikang Under the Wild Bombing of Enemy Aircraft

(Haikang Express News) Haikang County has been repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft in the past month. On the 11th and 12th of this month, it was bombed again by enemy aircraft, causing a terrible disaster. The situation of the losses is recorded below. According to statistics, enemy aircraft dropped more than 20 bombs in two days. One bomb landed outside the city in the back of Xiheli Observation Station, hitting the Tieyuan Ironworks. In the city, one incendiary bomb landed on Guangchao South Road, opposite the Leiyang Printing House in the back alley of Wang Yan's house. A fire broke out immediately and burned four houses in a row. The front seat of the Ailian Pavilion opposite the house was destroyed by the shock, and a section of the outer wall of the Shitou Pavilion on the right was collapsed. One bomb landed on the right side of the Caiyuanhao on Guangchao South Road, destroying five houses. The Mo residence opposite was destroyed by the shock. One bomb landed in the front seat of the Catholic Church in the eastern section of the town, destroying one room of the right side of the front seat cover and the wall. The Dashengtang and Qishengtang shops next door were also destroyed by the shock. One bomb landed behind the Catholic Church, destroying one room of the church's thatched house.

### The Internal Strife in Guangdong Between the Enemy is Becoming More Intense Enemy Army and Navy Almost Clashed

Enemy Marines Were Prevented from Landing The Enemy Navy Will Not Provide Transportation

[Macau Express News] The internal strife between the army and navy of the enemy troops entering Guangdong has been brewing for a long time. At first, it was to compete for credit, and then they restrained each other. A few days ago, the enemy army wanted to open the Pearl River waterway to restore the prosperity of the urban area, but the enemy navy insisted on not allowing it, and made things difficult and intimidated all incoming ships in every possible way, trying to block the traffic. Therefore, the enemy army was deeply regretful. On the 14th of this month, an enemy warship, fully loaded with about 500 marines, stopped at Bai Goose Pond and landed to parade, scattering in various military canteens, shouting and yelling. As a rule, the enemy troops often hide in the camp at night, fearing the attack of our guerrillas, and dare not go out. That night, the enemy marines did not return to the warship after the time had passed, and the enemy military police sent many people to disperse them. The next day, the commander of the enemy warship actually landed to meet the military officer of the enemy army, requesting to find a place to station, but the Guangzhou enemy chief refused and did not allow them to land. As a result, the soldiers of the enemy warship made a great noise. The enemy army on land, fearing an incident, immediately sent a large team carrying many light machine guns to deploy along the embankment to prevent the enemy soldiers from approaching the shore. For a time, pedestrians were cut off and the situation was very serious. Later, people from the enemy special service team were sent to mediate, and it was agreed that the enemy officers from the army and navy would meet at the Aiqun Hotel. As a result, the two sides insisted on their own opinions and each sent a telegram back to their country to report and wait for a solution. At the meeting, the enemy navy stated that before the incident was resolved, it would not be responsible for transportation and relief, in order to restrain the enemy army on land. Its internal split has become increasingly acute.

Movies and Dramas

### The Film City's Widows

Hollywood is a place filled with countless "tearless widows" and "merry widows," who truly deserve these names. They pass their days singing, dancing, or knitting, just like their husbands who only care about pursuing their passions and neglect their wives.

They often begin their widowhood after their honeymoon. This life can last from one to ten years, or even longer. The length of time is determined only by themselves.

Who are these people? This doesn't just refer to the wives of male stars. Many are famous actresses of the time, like Claudette Colbert and Irene Dunne, who became widows due to their husbands' professions. Bette Davis became a "golf widow" immediately after her marriage. Every Sunday, when she was bored alone, she would swing a club and go to the golf course to stretch her muscles. There are countless widows like this.

Here, we must first understand the term "widow." Hollywood widows seem to belong to the same category as Indian widows who commit sati (Suttee). Indian customs believe that after a husband dies, he goes to another bright and happy world, so women commit self-immolation to go with him to paradise. Isn't the motivation extremely similar between the two? Looking up the dictionary, the strict definition of a widow should be "a wife left behind after her husband dies." However, we don't need to be too strict. Although their husbands have not died, they cannot be with them day and night, so they are left alone in their empty rooms. It is not an exaggeration to call them widows.

Opera star Bing Crosby spends all day at the golf course. Sometimes, even on the premiere day of his new film, he can't put down his golf club. If the company needs to find him, they just go to the golf association, and they can always find him. But his wife suffers and cannot go with him. This is one aspect. At the same time, he is also a horse racing fanatic, completely absorbed in it. Fortunately, his wife is virtuous, knitting and raising their children to pass the time. She holds two positions: "horse racing widow" and "golf widow."

James Cagney and Dick Powell have their own unique hobby, which they call "yachting." However, their wives don't go with them. Every time they happily set off, two short-lived widows are added to the film city. They stay at home, take care of the children, manage the household, and play with their dogs when they have free time.

Lee S. Howard's wife would rather be a widow than go on photography trips with her husband. She said it well, "I can't run around with him everywhere, climbing steep mountains to photograph sea geese like him. I absolutely can't do it. Rather than break my bones and become an amateur photography expert, I'd rather be a widow at home." Similarly, Basil Rathbone's wife feels the same way. These are two "camera widows."

Paul Muni has a habit of deep thinking. When an important role is assigned to him, he spends two to four hours a day for one or two weeks, pondering and studying the character's personality. During this time, his wife is left aside. Paul does very deep research on every role. For roles like Emile Zola, he reads various reference books, and his wife accompanies him closely, even going to the film set. However, when he is immersed in thought, although his body is by his wife's side, his soul has already left this world and flown to Zola's world. Mrs. Paul Muni cannot follow him there.

Hedy Lamarr is also a widow, an arms widow. She said that in her previous days, all she heard was "arms, arms," nothing else, which made her disgusted. She finally escaped from that bejeweled "narrow cage" to find another life in the wider society.

When Roger Pryor and his band go on tour, Ann Sothern is also a widow. Similarly, when Dorothy Lamour's husband goes on tour with his band, Dorothy stays at home, at the film set, at the radio station, and sometimes at the Coconut Grove, listening to Rudy Vallée's music with her friends or her husband's friends. These two can be considered representatives of the many "band widows" in Hollywood.

Bette Davis also had a period as a "band widow," but later she traveled around with her husband. Eventually, her husband left that life, and she also moved away from that widow's life. However, recently, they are about to separate again.

Errol Flynn's wife, Lili Damita, also lives a solitary life for most of the days due to her husband's wandering nature. Moreover, Errol Flynn doesn't just wander a little; he wanders thousands of miles, across the vast ocean, tirelessly, never thinking of returning home. This time he has been missing for more than three weeks. We hope he is on a happy journey, but his absurd character of only caring about wandering and not caring about his wife is a bit uncomplimentary.

Gene Hersholt is a bookworm. As soon as a new book is published, he must read it. At the same time, he likes to study the Bible. This makes his wife a "book widow."

There are many "political widows." Mrs. Melvyn Douglas, Mrs. Robert Montgomery, Mrs. Edward Arnold, and Mrs. Edward G. Robinson all belong to this category.

The clever Mrs. Pat O'Brien salvaged part of her widow's life. Pat O'Brien also likes to watch horse races and often spends time with his comrades Ralph Bellamy, James Cagney, and Frank McHugh. To remedy this, she moved her house to Del Mar, which is connected to the racecourse. This way, when he goes to the racecourse, she can also participate. Or even if she doesn't go, being so close, jokingly speaking, as long as she rings the bell, Pat can hear it and know that it's time to come back for dinner.

Myrna Loy is a "producer's widow," and Ilka Chase is a "scriptwriter's widow." Their widowhood occurs when their husbands are focused on their work and have no time to care for "her."

Actresses who marry people outside the film industry, such as Claudette Colbert and Irene Dunne, both have husbands who are doctors. When Claudette's husband goes out to dinner with her, he disappears as soon as ten o'clock strikes, like a ghost. He has good reasons to excuse himself, such as "I must go to the hospital" or "I have some work to do." Claudette's widowhood is completely tied to the health of the social elite. Irene Dunne's husband, a dentist, is even further away in New York. He is a dedicated person, so she has to spend more days embracing her lonely quilt. There is often a distance of three thousand miles between the couple, thus creating Irene Dunne's reputation as a "long-distance widow." Mita Leon Garfield is also one of them.

Fred Astaire is often diligent in practicing dance, neglecting his wife. Spencer Tracy, Louis Stone, and Robert Montgomery often stay in the film set. They are all businessman-like stars, treating the film set like an office, staying there all day. Even a businessman's wife would visit her husband's office once or twice a year, but these three wives never do that. While their husbands are working, they just stay at home and read film news in newspapers and magazines.

At the same time, Robert Montgomery and Spencer Tracy love polo, Colman and Lee love tennis, Don Ameche loves broadcasting, Dick Foran loves playing poker, and Rock and Chester Morris love magic. These are all reasons for wives to become widows.

Remember Edgar Bergen. Although he is not yet married, we dare to assert that his future wife will definitely be a widow. At least, her chances of sitting on his lap will be much less than Charlie McCarthy's—that little wooden man.

But if Clark Gable and Carole Lombard get married—the possibility of this happening is now greater—Lombard will never be a widow. Their interests are exactly the same. Clark will never go duck hunting alone without Carole.

### Internal Decision by the General Association on the 16-Man Squad for the Macau-Hong Kong Interport Football Match, Canceling the Previous Proposal to Select Young Players Entirely

This 16-man squad is an internal decision and still needs to be reviewed at a meeting before a final decision is made.

[Our reporter's exclusive report] The Hong Kong-Macau Interport Football Match was initiated in the year before last, and the victory in both previous editions belonged to the Macau team. This was because in those two editions, the Hong Kong General Association fulfilled the request of the Macau General Association and completely selected Group B players as representatives, leading to two defeats by the Macau team.

This year, the tournament is held in Macau on rotation, and the match date is set for April 16. Yesterday, the Hong Kong General Association received a letter from the Macau General Association, stating that they were very pleased that the Hong Kong General Association had accepted their request to select Group A players as representatives this time and invited the Hong Kong team to come on schedule.

The Management Subcommittee responsible for selecting the Hong Kong team representatives has held several meetings to discuss the selection of personnel. Initially, the intention was to completely select young players as representatives, giving them an opportunity to compete abroad and gain experience. This proposal has been reported in previous newspapers. Later, the Management Subcommittee members believed that since the Macau General Association had requested the Hong Kong team to select Group A players to participate, it could be expected that the Macau team's strength would not be weak. If capable players were not carefully selected to fight, they were afraid of repeating the failures of the previous two times. Therefore, they canceled the previous proposal to completely select young players and internally decided on 16 strong players as intended representatives. However, this internal decision should not be regarded as a fact. Whether there will be changes in the future still needs to be reviewed at a meeting before a final decision is made. The list of intended representatives is as follows: (Football Field Tai Sui)

Zhang Rongcai (South China South) Deng Qin (Scotch Team)

Wu Liefa (Kowloon Club) Bi Liban (Police Club) Mai Shaohan (South China South)

Li Guowei (South China South) Xu Jingcheng (Oriental Club) Bi Ludo (St. Joseph's) Bi Lidi (Middlesex) Han Nibo Lu (Kowloon Club)

Liao Yachen (Kowloon Club) Jin Shi (St. Joseph's) Chen Dehui (South China South) Zuo Zhi (Kowloon Club) Yang Shuiyi (South China South) Deng Guangsen (South China South)

### Shanghai Lido Plans to Come South for Competition

[Our reporter's exclusive report] The Shanghai Paramount Ballroom basketball team has gathered many talented players and has a high reputation. It is currently the most popular strong team in the "isolated island." A few months ago, the Hong Kong Star team sent a letter inviting the team to come to Hong Kong for competition at the end of April. According to the team's reply, they agreed. Next opportunity, the team considered going to the Philippines, but there were no concrete plans.

According to news, it has not been decided whether the Paramount Ballroom basketball team will come for real. However, the Lido football team wants to come south for competition at the end of April. At that time, Hong Kong's football season will have ended. If the team comes, it will be a great thing.

### Yesterday's Tennis Singles Match: The Lin Brothers Show Their Heroism, and There Will Be Four More Singles Matches Today

Yesterday's Hong Kong Open Tennis Tournament, the singles match between Da Linzhen and Cai Yongshan, attracted many spectators. The surroundings of the court were packed, making it the most enthusiastic match since the start of the singles tournament this year. Cai is a rising star, young and strong. Before the match, many said that this person would pose a great threat to Da Linzhen. Sure enough, Cai showed amazing performance in the first set. An old player like Da Linzhen felt it was difficult to deal with. Cai's serve was also solid, and his volley and drop shot were also quite accomplished. Unfortunately, he lacked experience, and mistakes were frequent, especially his baseline shots, which often went out of bounds, leading to his failure. On the other hand, Da Linzhen dared not underestimate his opponent, step by step, and his shots were cautious, and his landing points were appropriate. So he won with 7-5, 6-4. In the match between Huang Zhaorong and Ma Huiguang, Ma was no match. Huang won two sets in a row with 6-2, 6-3. The match was not very exciting. In the third singles match, Xiao Linzhen faced Guo Qingsen. Guo struggled hard in the preliminary round, making it difficult for Xiao Linzhen to win. Unfortunately, after Guo failed with 5-7 in the first set, he became dispirited and lost the second set with 6-3 and was eliminated.

### Today's Football: South China South Will Play

(Our reporter's exclusive report) Recently, the football battles have evolved into a big mess, making the football fans laugh and cry. It is still unknown who will win the great trophy. However, according to the current situation, South China South still has the highest hope.

At 5 pm today, South China South will play against St. Joseph's at Jia Shan. In theory, South China South will win, but it still depends on whether the players maintain their normal state. Because we are concerned that South China South lost to the Police team last week, we are a bit worried. If South China South fails again, the situation will be dire.

In this final stage of the trophy competition, the South China South players must not be negligent and must move forward. If they win against Joseph today and beat the Kowloon Club on Saturday, then they are guaranteed to win the championship. Work hard, the glittering trophy is waiting for you to embrace it!

The ticket price for this match has been reduced, with covered stands costing four corners and open-air stands costing two corners. With such a low price, you may want to give it a try. The lineups for the two teams are as follows: (Dong Lang)

### The Organization of German Sports Institutions

Today's German authorities, especially the head of state and prime minister Hitler, attach great importance to sports for the development of social health and education. In order to train the national physique, it is necessary to rectify everything from the national level as a prerequisite. Looking at the 1936 Olympic Games held in Berlin, the foresight of the personnel in charge, the practicality of the work, and the efficiency of the organization can be seen. They began to implement the development of German sports work in 1933, and their achievements were no different from the Olympic Games. The effectiveness of the work in the past six years has not only enabled today's German sports undertakings to improve compared with the past, but also has profound significance and system for the construction of sports.

After the German National Socialist Party took power, it was committed to developing sports, and it was obvious that there was a need for thorough reform. At that time, almost every sports training department had countless institutions and organizations, the situation was complicated, the system was difficult to distinguish, and some often argued with each other due to private opinions, and the work was completely without spirit and very scattered. Later, all members freely voted to establish the National Sports Training Committee, headed by a director. The board of directors was the organizer of the 1936 Olympic Games in Germany. However, the committee's progress on various organizational tasks was often stalled, because at that time, the sports faction and the gymnastics faction not only had no sincerity to cooperate, but also became more emotional, so disputes often arose in the conference hall.

In 1933, Schmidt, who was appointed as the sports commissioner and has now been promoted to the national sports leader, took office and immediately took the abolition of the above-mentioned disputes and the unification of various sports institutions as the first task, and organized the National Sports Training Association. Today, all sports or gymnastics organizations in Germany are under the command of the association. Because of the different types of sports training, specialized departments were established, and sports institutions were established in various places in accordance with national organizational regulations to facilitate contact, so that sports undertakings can be concentrated under a single command to facilitate the conduct, which is the performance of the 1936 Olympic Games. The finances of sports undertakings are also properly managed, either by providing subsidies or by ordering savings, such as using the income from football matches to build a swimming pool.

Since the head of state and prime minister issued an order on December 21, 1938, all German sports institutions have been directly under the protection and command of the National Socialist Party. The significance is not that the National Sports Training Association has abandoned its sports work and become a purely political sports association. The explanation of this point can be seen from the association's achievements in sports and the country. There are two games in Group B.

### Tonight's Men's Basketball, Group A Suspended, and There Will Be Two Games in Group B

Tonight's open men's basketball game will be held in the YMCA basketball hall, with only two Group B games. At 6:30, South China will fight Da Zhong, and at 7:30, Hai Guang will meet Qing Zhi. The Group A game between South China and Pei Ying has been postponed due to events. In terms of the strength of the Group B teams, the first game is evenly matched, and it is impossible to predict who will win. The second game is not a strong team, but Qing Zhi's offensive power is better and may win. The lineups of the teams are as follows:

(South China Team) Luo Huahua, Zhuo Hongfei, Lin Han, He Qinghe, Zhuo Runrong, Tan Guokun, Ying Guoxiang, Zhao Manbiao, Cui Picheng, Huang Tuzhao,

(Da Zhong Team) Dong Biao, Wu Yaokun, Zheng Kangyong, Mai Qi, Chen Bozhong, Chen Boxi, He Quangui, Huang Ji, Zheng Mengbiao, Li Jingli,

### Hong Kong Inter-Port Team Going to the Philippines: To Play Singapore Chinese on April 2nd for Practice

[Our Reporter's Exclusive] The Hong Kong inter-port football team, scheduled to depart for the Philippines on April 18th, has already had its 15 members selected by the General Association. Except for Ken Yin, Lie Li, and the later replacement Parkar, who all claimed they could not go due to other commitments, all others have replied to the Association, stating that they can go. Furthermore, the General Association plans to hold one or two practice matches before the Hong Kong inter-port team departs, so that each representative can understand the collaborative effort. However, given the current tense football season, it is difficult to find free time to hold these matches. Therefore, it has been decided that during the second match when the Singapore Chinese team comes to Hong Kong (April 2nd), this inter-port team will use the name of the Hong Kong United team to play against the Singapore Chinese team. This is truly killing two birds with one stone.

### The Efficacy of Morning Exercises (II)

— Zhuoyue

(3) It has the efficacy of correcting the body and mind.

The wall separating the body and mind has been gradually torn down since the 19th century, and monism has also risen to prominence, leading to a major shift in the implementation of physical education. The former view that physical education was only for physical training has also collapsed. Morning exercises are a type of physical training, so they can certainly include both physical and mental training, achieving a corrective effect. Moreover, common people's problems, while sleeping, will inevitably generate many wild ideas, which are useless and may even harm the body and mind. This is especially true when one cannot fall asleep or when waking up. These fantasies will make you unwilling to get out of bed and continue to daydream. If this continues day after day, the crisis for both the body and mind will definitely increase gradually. In the end, your life's work will also be controlled by it, rather than you being in control. Therefore, we must develop the habit of morning exercises to save ourselves from this crisis. Because the air in the early morning is a very clean holy water that can wash away your turbid mind. Therefore, after doing morning exercises every day, you will definitely benefit from improved blood circulation and a clear mind.

(4) It can help digestion and increase appetite.

First, we must understand the relationship between appetite and digestion. Everyone feels that when the stomach is hungry (strong digestive power), the amount of food intake increases significantly, and when the stomach is full (weak digestive power), they don't feel like eating anything. From this, we can derive a theorem: a strong appetite is directly proportional to the strength of digestive power, that is, when digestive power is strong, appetite is strong, and when digestive power is weak, appetite naturally decreases. Based on this definition, if we want a strong appetite, we must improve our digestive function. There are many ways to improve digestive function. In my opinion, adjusting our physical fitness daily is the most fundamental and effective method, especially morning exercise.

Although "morning exercises" are gentle exercises, after completing seven sets, the amount of exercise is already saturated, and the consumption of energy is not small. The human body is like a machine. It produces "ability" only when it has fuel, and it can move only when it has ability. When we are hungry, we always feel weak all over, and we cannot muster any strength. This is because the body lacks fuel and cannot generate heat, resulting in no force. When we exercise, we need a large amount of heat, which disappears in various parts of the body. After the heat is consumed, we need to replenish fuel in order to continue exercising. For the human body, food is the fuel. The more heat is consumed, the greater the amount of food (fuel) required. (Increased food intake) When the waist and abdominal muscles are exercised, they directly help the stomach lining rotate and gastric juices flow, which further enhances the stomach's digestive function. Therefore, morning exercises can indeed help digestion and lead to a strong appetite.

(5) The effect of promoting development.

The general view is that the strength of an individual's physique is directly proportional to the health and strength of their genetic makeup. Although this view is not wrong, it is somewhat biased. The idea of "like father, like son" should not be overemphasized. In fact, in addition to genetic factors, the most important thing is postnatal training. Therefore, a sound physique must have both superior innate heredity and good environmental training. Even if innate heredity is not good, it will not work without postnatal cultivation. However, people with innate deficiencies (with the exception of some deficiencies) can also achieve the hope of sound development through postnatal cultivation and training. "Morning exercises" are the most reliable type of exercise. Young people during the development period who are consistent with this type of exercise can achieve average (complete) development and will not be deformed or localized. Therefore, (morning exercises) are extremely relevant to the development of young people during the development period. (To be continued)

### White Cogongrass Flowers

— Yuren

A new kind of mountain wilderness, permeated with a hazy mist, coats everything in a thick color of melancholy.

There are nine of us altogether, silently advancing along the muddy road. Work drives us, and even encourages us, to walk on foot to a place far beyond the clouds and smoke. We, with our bodies dampened by the rain, silently gaze at the remote and scattered villages, our anxious eyes constantly searching along the long journey for the distant destination of this departure.

Gradually, a pile of white houses clearly emerges before our eyes, slowly approaching, approaching. Based on the estimation of the distance of the journey, we know that this is a market with a beautiful name—White Cogongrass Flowers!

Walking into the market town, what meets our eyes is a pile of scattered rubble all over the ground, and broken, scorched house corners. The phenomenon of ten houses, nine empty, flawlessly demonstrates that this is a place that has suffered the calamity of war!

Loneliness, loneliness! Only a few villagers set up stalls selling pastries by the roadside, only a few yellow dogs linger and hesitate in the streets, only a symphonic orchestra of two is playing an elegy for the market town's tragic encounter!

We walked straight from the west of the market to the east of the market, like a team of explorers stepping into a desolate ancient city!

When we reached the outskirts of the market, we couldn't help but wander around the ruins that had been burned and looted by the [Japanese] soldiers. Probably because no one had excavated and cleaned up after the looting, the ground still broadcast a burst of the smell of rotting corpses. If we hadn't remembered that this was a market town after the disaster, we might have been aware that it was a quiet wasteland!

On the rubble, in the distance, a yellow dog was chewing on "something white. Curiosity drove me to approach and take a look. Ah! That turned out to be a human skull, a yellowish-white skull with flesh. I saw those cavernous eyes, cavernous nose, and cavernous mouth! Although there was no expression on the flesh, I keenly felt the infinite grief, anger, and sorrow hidden on that fixed, ferocious skull. I gently took it in my hand for detailed observation, and the rotten flesh that had not been completely eroded emitted a strong, pungent odor!

The villagers told me: The original body of that skull was one of the vagrants who came to White Cogongrass Flowers with great difficulty. He sacrificed his life under the enemy's brutal massacre when the war broke out last winter. The passage of time has eroded the flesh of the dead. Now, only a broken head and a few broken bones are left on this rubble!

What a bewildering story! What a painful and evocative relic on the ruins! When I closed my eyes and used my imagination to construct the situation under the trampling of the enemy's iron hooves, an atmosphere of terror and hatred tightly wrapped around my chest!

The villagers said that skulls are common here, because most places have not been cleaned and removed. Therefore, the entire White Cogongrass Flowers is constantly shrouded in the stench of corpses. On the other hand, because the residents of the market have all fled, the scenery on the market is even more desolate!

The rain was a little lighter. We stopped for a moment and continued eastward.

Ah! White Cogongrass Flowers! White Cogongrass Flowers in the stench of corpses, White Cogongrass Flowers in loneliness, White Cogongrass Flowers everywhere with broken tiles and broken walls! The residual scene after your disaster is forever etched in our hearts. We will never forget you, and the millions of compatriots in the East River will also leave a bloody inscription for you forever! We hope that one day: in the glorious struggle, the concrete made of iron, blood, and flesh will recreate you from scratch! Let the devils brutally and lewdly trample on you like a young woman! Let the enemy destroy you like a toy! Today, millions of hearts are shaking and beating rapidly for your experience, millions of spears and shields are being fiercely tempered for your shame, and millions of people are shaking their shoulders and working hard for your revival!

White Cogongrass Flowers! Let your new life be based on the active national struggle!

### The Snow in Manchuria

— Shuqun

The tacit acknowledgement of the other party's sincerity is the most certain answer, not allowing her any doubt or justification. Thus, her former goodwill towards the impression and fantasy of the Volunteer Army has become an unattainable dream of the past. The feeling left in the dream is only regret, because people are unwilling to be violated—especially when it comes to personal intuition, especially for those who value self-esteem too much. She believes that self-esteem is her chastity; even though she is weak, she tolerates coercion and threats.

When he urged her to leave, she wrote:

"Wait a moment."

She looked at her favorite vase, the chrysanthemums in the vase, the piano scores that were often in her hands. Goodbye, this seemed to be the last look.

Suddenly, the sound of the enemy's door knocking rang outside. He was so stimulated that he almost shouted:

"Do you want to trap me? You witch!"

He immediately decided—to shoot the person outside the door. If necessary, there was himself. Leaving her, leaving a necessary job for another comrade. When he learned that it was the maid who came to deliver tea, he took out a handkerchief for her; using a gun to maintain the sanctity of the order, he forced her to say to the outside:

"I don't want tea."

"What about the guest?"

"Gue——st"? He looked at his shaking head and said again: "Gue...st...has...gone..."

"Miss, why is your voice trembling? Are you sick? Let me come in and see!"

He thought:

"It's over!"

At this moment, he possessed a superhuman wisdom, which made his hand close the electric light. Moreover, he gave her a sign with the gun—his terror. At the same time, he had another idea:

"If she is braver, what use is my gun?"

He also thought about running away at this opportunity, wouldn't it also be up to her?"

However, she was trembling extremely. If he didn't hold her clothes, she might fall down immediately.

A crack opened in the door, and a strand of light from the hallway, along with an incomplete head shadow, fell on the dark floor. The maid's voice:

"Miss, are you asleep?"

"Not...yet..."

"You must be sick. Your voice has changed!"

"No——"

"Then have you been there."

"You know everything——"

### On Surrender Eight-legged Essays

— Jing Chunfeng

In the inaugural issue of Shanghai's *Cosmos* magazine, there is an article by Ba Jin titled "Formalists," referring to those who only write official anti-war articles and shout slogans like "The final victory will surely belong to us," but do not actively participate in the war. Although such articles do not explicitly criticize the traitors who advocate peace talks, those who are considered decent people should probably put down the book and pass it by. But to our surprise, a certain newspaper in Hong Kong actually took this article and wrote a lengthy "On Anti-war Eight-legged Essays," not only helping the idle to criticize those who write "Anti-war Eight-legged Essays," but even fundamentally overturning the case, even opposing the war itself. Their conclusion is a surrender and peace-seeking. Now we can quote a passage:

"We mostly agree with the above article. What is worth considering is "The final victory belongs to the masses..." In fact, if we continue to fight, no one can guarantee this happiness—continuing to fight now will definitely not win the support of the masses. We want victory, we can only strive for it through peaceful struggle. When we have peace, then all the emptiness of anti-war eight-legged essays will naturally disappear. In short, there is only one way. There is only one way to move towards peace."

The absurdity of the content of this article is self-evident. However, just as they were criticizing "Anti-war Eight-legged Essays," they themselves fell into the trap of eight-legged formulas, revealing their true form and starting to write surrender eight-legged essays.

If we analyze it according to Ba Jin's formula for anti-war eight-legged essays, we can get the following answers:

The first paragraph, based on the principle that no one can escape death, introduces a set of "No war that cannot be reconciled," explaining that victory requires peace, and defeat also requires peace. Since peace is required regardless of victory or defeat, why not seek peace today? This paragraph first establishes a footnote for the following text, which argues that China must seek peace. The second paragraph explains that after a dozen months of war, China has already failed and lost the support of the people, probably with the words of the filthy guerrilla teams. The third paragraph discusses the international situation, proving that China will surely be defeated if it continues to resist. At the same time, it presents the Konoe statement and Wang Jingwei's traitorous suggestion declaration, indicating that this is the only way to save China. The descriptive words that praise Wang's enthusiasm for planning the country and his bright and great attitude must be used vigorously in this paragraph. The fourth paragraph scolds the Soviet Union and criticizes the Chinese Communist Party, expressing loyalty to the country and a willingness to sacrifice oneself for the country. At the same time, it laments that the people do not recognize Jing Shan Jade. Furthermore, it maliciously threatens the people, saying: Since Japan treats us so generously, how can we not seek peace with them? If we miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, it will be "difficult to fight and difficult to reconcile." The fifth paragraph is that final victory will surely belong to Japan.

This set of eight arguments, with nothing to call it, can only be called surrender eight-legged essays. Compared with "Anti-war Eight-legged Essays," there is a very obvious difference. In any case, anti-war eight-legged essays are still the works of Chinese people, while surrender eight-legged essays are Japanese goods. Furthermore, the author of "Anti-war Eight-legged Essays" still has the belief that the war will be won, and advocates for resistance, while the author of "Surrender Eight-legged Essays" fundamentally does not advocate for resistance, does not believe in certain victory, and simply kneels down and shouts surrender. One is a slave, and the other is struggling to survive in the face of death. Between the two, which one is desirable and which one is undesirable will be known without asking the wise.

Fortunately, there are still many people who write "Anti-war Eight-legged Essays." If everyone who writes "Anti-war Eight-legged Essays" changes their mind and starts writing "Surrender Eight-legged Essays," China's future would be worrying. It is better to listen to a Chinese person's "Anti-war Eight-legged Essays," even just the phrase "The final victory will surely belong to us," than to listen to a Japanese person's words and surrender. What do you, the reader, think?

November 30th, 8:40 PM, I was suddenly stunned to hear that my colleague, Hanabusa, had been killed in action.

It seems that there must be a problem with the Foshan wireless equipment. The situation has been very bad since yesterday. This morning, I heard that "Abe" was repairing the radio. Because it hasn't returned to normal yet, I thought the telephone or dry battery would be delivered. Although that was the case, I could imagine something from Captain Saida; however, no matter how I inquired with the military press department, Lieutenant Sugawara was already on the phone, speaking rapidly. I waited for him to finish, listening to him say, "1 PM? Further in? Right? Is it the right side? - Sigh - From the enemy on the right? Taking heavy fire?" Saying this, it must be information for releasing the battle situation. Looking at Lieutenant Sugawara's hateful face, the messenger on the right put his fingers in his ears and didn't take notes. The conversation seemed quite long, and I thought there would be many difficulties ahead, so I took a piece of paper from the side and started taking notes of Lieutenant Sugawara's fragmented words. When I did this, Lieutenant Sugawara glanced at me and immediately said with hesitation, "Has Hanabusa been killed?" Saying this, he handed me the receiver. "Hanabusa?" I suddenly felt as if dark clouds had covered a clear sky, and I immediately pressed the receiver to my ear. However, I couldn't hear anything. "Hello! Hello!" I asked anxiously, but there was no sound from the other end. Lieutenant Sugawara pointed to the receiver and said, "No, no! Pick up the Suft, pick up the Suft." I hurriedly grabbed the protruding metal fitting and immediately heard Captain Saida's voice... "What's wrong, is there something to finish? Ah! Now Takao will talk to you!" After hearing Takao's voice, I anxiously said, "Has Hanabusa been killed?"... "No... in any case..., it's hopeless, distressing,... it's a distressing matter..." His voice often seemed sad. No matter how I listened, his mind was confused and he couldn't speak coherently. He repeated himself many times, finally clarifying the fact that Hanabusa was dead without a doubt. I returned to where we were gathered, feeling uneasy, perhaps unable to say anything! In the evening, under the lamp, Nakamura and Chiku came. Toki didn't reveal the information that was to be released. When they came in, other than my saying "Hanabusa has been killed," no one else was willing to speak. After a while, everyone had a suffocating look on their faces. Toki walked over here, said "Ugh!" and glared for a moment, then suddenly lay back in the chair and crossed his hands. Toki's face, who had sailed on the ship with Hanabusa, had turned pale. The liaison officers stood as still as statues. I opened the messy and difficult-to-read memorandum, filled with vertical and horizontal writing, on the desk and told everyone. I kept talking, but everyone remained silent. Later, everyone sighed and said: "In any case, it's necessary to report to headquarters..." I looked at my watch, it was already 8:15 PM. There would be radio contact with Taipei at 9 PM, probably to send this message. The simple report to headquarters must be sent out! I picked up a pencil and started writing the draft.

### My Memories

— Chen Xianwen

In spring, along the murmuring stream, I stroll leisurely down a path shaded by green leaves, to that verdant hillside.

The red azaleas, the bright flowers, are like fire; like the fleeting glimpse of cheeks; and, even more, like the fleeting glimpse of lips.

The cuckoo hides its body in the bushes; but listen, that is a painful sound, it cries out the sorrows of spring!

Spring has the passionate songs of the shepherdesses, which, like the continuous mountain peaks, have intoxicating melodies with ups and downs, are you not moved?

A youthful heart in a youthful atmosphere.

In spring, the birds all build nests in the trees,

In spring, the warm sunshine is on your body, and there is also a warm breeze on your body, how can this gentleness not make your limbs go limp?

Spring gives me a string of tenderness.

Spring gives me a beautiful memory.

Now, spring has come again, and I imagine the road of spring, and it actually has a different mood.

Red azaleas, like blood! The sound of the cuckoo is still sorrowful, but it has a different kind of painful touch.

Songs often come from the mouths of shepherdesses but often stop abruptly, followed by some tragic memories, recalling a transformation of fate, in the clear sky.

The birds are still singing in the trees; the sunshine, the wind, do they not still exist? But, it makes you irritable, it makes you hot, it makes your blood circulate faster.

Because this is a spring in the midst of war!
