### Where Does Japan's Confidence in Long-Term Warfare Lie?

Recently, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma, in response to questions from members of the House of Representatives regarding policy towards China, stated that Japan would never change its established policy towards China, and that even if a third party were to impose economic pressure on Japan, Japan had already prepared countermeasures. The reason the Japanese House of Representatives raised questions about policy towards China was to express the Japanese people's anxiety and disappointment regarding the invasion of China, but Hiranuma's response still indicated that the Japanese fascist military clique would stubbornly go its own way.

Japan, a small island nation, combined with its holdings of Korea, Taiwan, and Southern Sakhalin, amounts to only over 670,000 square kilometers of land and over 97 million people, with extremely scarce agricultural and mineral resources. To maintain a ten-year war against China, or even a hundred-year war, and even to not hesitate to fight a third country, is truly nothing more than mad barking and delusional ravings. In the past nineteen months of the Sino-Japanese War, there have already been signs that Japan's manpower is unable to continue supporting the war effort. The new troops recently dispatched to China are mostly young soldiers with poor eyesight, and various mechanized units are mixed with many fascist European comrades. As for the recent reports that the Japanese military intends to extend the service period of the army and navy in China, and the recent active recruitment of Chinese vagrants and bandits to implement a policy of using Chinese to control Chinese, these are even more ironclad proof of the emptiness of Japan's domestic manpower.

Economically, Japan is even more extremely weak. At the beginning of this year, Japanese public opinion expressed optimistic views on Japan's past economic situation, boasting of the strength of its economic foundation, which could bear the dual tasks of "fighting" and "construction." Such optimistic public opinion cannot deceive the Japanese people, nor can it deceive international observers. Just looking at its most critical finance and foreign trade, one can see that Japan's economy has reached the point of total collapse.

First, let's look at Japan's finances: In the previous fiscal year, general expenditures and special military expenditures for the invasion of China amounted to approximately 6.03 billion yuan. In the past fiscal year, this increased to over 8.04 billion yuan. This fiscal year, according to reports, general expenditures are over 3.69 billion yuan, and special military expenditures are 5.4 billion yuan, totaling over 9 billion yuan. With last year's income of only 1 billion yuan, Japan is already showing signs of being unable to bear the burden. Comparing general income and expenditure, monthly expenditure consistently exceeds income by 300 to 500 million yuan. To fill this deficit, Japan can only rely on issuing public bonds, increasing new taxes, and inflating the currency, doing its utmost to exploit the people. However, all three of these methods have now reached the saturation point. Of the 4.3 billion yuan of public bonds issued last year, only 3.6 billion yuan were sold. The increase of 230 million yuan in new taxes has already made the people consider the "one dish, one soup" principle to be a luxury. The year-end issuance of 2.85 billion yuan in paper currency, while indeed creating an unprecedented record for Japanese paper currency issuance, does not even include the large amount of military scrip and counterfeit money issued in China. In that case, with this year's 9 billion yuan in expenditures, at this time of impoverished people and exhausted resources, I am afraid that there is no other way to go but down the road to bankruptcy!

Next, let's look at Japan's foreign trade: Japan's foreign trade is the lifeline of Japan's various industrial sectors. In the first eleven months of last year, exports were 2.39 billion yuan, and imports were 2.38 billion yuan, resulting in an import surplus of over 10 million yuan. Japan considers this to be the best phenomenon during wartime. In fact, this import surplus phenomenon in Japan is caused by its invasionary military force. Last year, Japan's trade with the so-called Japanese currency bloc in puppet Manchukuo and North China increased by 40% in exports and 18% in imports compared to the previous year. However, in terms of exports and imports to Europe, America, and other countries, there were decreases, and there was still a continued import surplus, and the degree of deterioration was even more severe than before. Therefore, the Japanese government feels that the power of trade control is not enough, and also wants to promote various export trade promotion policies. Now, Japan's foreign trade, both exports and imports, is entirely aimed at military needs under government control. As a result, a large amount of gold is constantly flowing out, and general non-military industries in the country are generally declining. Although the increase in other commodity prices and the unemployment of labor cannot fully reveal the true situation under the supervision of the economic police, judging from the phenomena that have been revealed, there is already a tendency to move towards the road of deterioration.

Regardless of manpower or material resources, Japan has no possibility of long-term warfare. What Japan now hopes for is, on the one hand, to obtain raw materials and food for long-term warfare from China, such as oil, coal, and iron from the Northeast, cotton and wool from North China, and rice and grain from the Yangtze River basin, which are currently being plundered as much as possible. On the other hand, it hopes to continue to be able to sell Japan's main products to the United Kingdom, the United States, and their colonies, thereby obtaining a supply of raw materials and military supplies from the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, as long as China can break Japan's economic control forces in the guerrilla areas, and the United Kingdom and the United States can implement economic retaliation against Japan, then the dream that Japan boasts of being able to cope with long-term warfare will be seen to be shattered with the collapse of its national power.

### A Visit to a People's School in Kunming

— (Special Kunming Correspondent of This Newspaper) Mu Lin

The severe cold of winter is quickly passing. The biting north wind has gradually reduced its power. The weather in the mountain country has gradually warmed up, camellias have bloomed in the wilderness, and birds have gathered to compose a song of returning spring. A gentle spring breeze brushes against the withered grass and trees, this is the time when the earth returns to spring!

The beginning of a new year, the renewal of all things, this is precisely because of the loveliness of the spring breeze, so everything on the earth has entered a new stage at this time, and more than 20,000 illiterates here, at this time, a part of them have also followed the spring breeze into the embrace of nurturing rain.

They and she, all because of the impermissibility of the environment, have reached the age of sixteen, and still have not read books. In fact, they are not willing to degenerate, unwilling to read books: but the domestic education has become aristocratic, so although you have stepped over the stage of going to school, you are still illiterate. Now, in order to support this long-term war of resistance, and to mobilize the organization of the rear masses, the existence of this large number of illiterates is no longer allowed in society. Therefore, the domestic education authorities, in addition to compulsory education, are further advocating this great mass education.

The plan for mass tutoring here was started as early as December of last year, but because of the overall planning, it was necessary to mobilize a large amount of manpower and financial resources, so it had to go through a long period of preparation. During this period, with the assistance of people from all walks of life, and the efforts of the education authorities, and with the Ministry of Education and the Education Department allocating considerable funds, it was not until December 17 that publicity began. From the 18th, more than 300 teachers from the city's primary schools conducted door-to-door investigations all day long, and it was not until December 26 that this messy account was investigated clearly. There are more than 20,000 illiterates in the entire Kunming City—from the age of sixteen to forty, of which women account for two-thirds. If compared with the population of the entire city, then it accounts for about one-tenth. Judging from this, we know that it is impossible to organize them without tutoring. After careful planning, they are divided into four phases, with 5,000 people tutored in each phase. The tutoring period is two months. The first phase stipulates that dropouts from the age of sixteen to thirty are to be designated at the Municipal Huashan, Dongsheng, Wucheng, Jinghong, Taoyuan, Xianhe, Shangyi, Guchong Anlan, Jukui, Qianwei, Jingxing, Guxiang, Wei Yuan, Zhongai, Chongren, Shulin, Yiguo, Xinqiao, Nanqiang, Wuxi, Yuantong, Dianfeng, Chenghua, Cuihu, Lianhua, Daguan, Xilin, and other 28 primary schools to be responsible for establishing people's schools for training. Under such organization, after many difficulties, this mass remedial education was finally realized on January 15.

Because the reporter is concerned about the important facilities in the rear of our war of resistance, he went to various schools to inspect the situation in other provinces. This was the fifth night after the start of school, and the sky was dotted with stars. The weather in the mountain country at night has a bit of the meaning of early spring cold. The streets were noisy with pedestrians coming and going, and the neon lights radiated their red and green light. The entire universe has been cast into the embrace of the night god. The reporter began his investigation work in such a colorful and vast twilight.

The subject of the investigation was Huashan Elementary School: it is located in the city center, the school is larger in scale, and there are more classes. Principal Chen of that school said to me, "Our school is located in the city center, and the population is relatively dense, but most of the families of civil servants and dignitaries live here in the area where we run the school. This is a very troublesome thing. Ordinary people also feel the pain of being illiterate, so when we went to register, they were very enthusiastic to sign up and participate, hoping to compensate for their past losses. And come to tutor. As for the relatives of civil servants! That's too troublesome, because most of the people in their families have read books, and only their maids and servants are illiterate, but they are determined not to let their servants or maids come to school to tutor and delay their work at home, because of such disputes, sometimes there will be quarrels, or they will go to the police to complain. It's really troublesome to the point of being indescribable." He also said: "Some women make excuses to give birth, or to get married soon to prevaricate, which is really impossible. Some have been investigated, but they don't come to class when school starts. When we investigate him, he doesn't answer that he has been evacuated to other counties: or he says that we have already dismissed this worker. But we are still doing it in the spirit of serving the society to remedy them." At this time, male and female students came one after another. He continued, "Among these tutoring students, in addition to a few who can come to school automatically, most of the students are urged three times and five times before they come. We have distributed the original students in the school, and each one invites a night school tutoring student. Some come as soon as they are invited, and some are scolded and beaten by their grandfathers and wives at home. And crying and returning to school. …………."

Speaking of this, it seems that Principal Chen's words have not been finished, because of the time, the reporter asked him to lead him to visit the class.

Out of the principal's office, a gust of breeze was lacking, making people feel a chill. Walking about a hundred steps away from the classroom, the ears were filled with shouting sounds, mixed with the cries of babies and the laughter of hi. It is really a quiet and melodious teaching conducting music. When he arrived outside the window, he faced inside. They are teaching Chinese. About forty people or so, but more than one hundred seats are all full, and some do not have seats, and they are reading while standing. Because this class is entirely women, some of the students are 28 or 9 years old, and each one has one or two children sitting next to her. Some unmarried women, for the inconvenience of going back and forth late at night. They are accompanied by their mothers or younger siblings to study, or because they are other people's maids or wet nurses, they have to bring their young ladies and young masters to school to study, so although there are only forty students, the seats are all completely occupied. Among them are fashionable and strangely dressed young women, gentle and elegant ladies. There are also village girls wearing cloth turbans, or dirty and unbearable maids. All kinds of colors, full of representatives of all levels, some people also take this opportunity to bring yarn to weave clothes, and some bring clothes to mend. If you want to interfere with her, she will answer that you are for the sake of living, and if you don't do it, you won't have food to eat, which really makes the school authorities unable to prohibit them. And those children, big and small, run around playing, if the teacher above interferes, then there will be a cry in the sky immediately. So the teachers have no way to do it, so they have to listen to these children shouting. Because these guys are playing, their mothers or wet nurses can concentrate on studying. Don't be surprised to take care of them.

When the reporter walked into the classroom, a teacher above specially called a student to dictate. She wrote the mouth of the Chinese character first, but she could no longer write the words inside. After the teacher repeatedly urged her, she replied: "Teacher, I am really sad, because the door of my house is not locked properly, and I am afraid that thieves will go in to steal things, so I can't remember it. Ah! I am really sad in my heart." These few words really made a solemn teacher laugh, but among the students below, some are good, and they can read and write publicly, which we can't but attribute to the hardworking teachers day and night.

In the second classroom, there are also more than forty students, and the situation is similar to that of the first class. There are nuns inside, and at the same time, there are wives of tailors and cobblers, and some are boat women. These are the particularly pitiful people of the lower class. They have to do hard rowing work during the day, and come to study at night, but looking at their expressions, they are very happy, probably because they feel that they are about to enter the light from the darkness, they are singing songs of national salvation, because it is the first time to sing the party song, they are all shrinking and looking at it. The reporter whispered, and the voices of more than forty people singing were not as loud as the voice of the teacher on the stage. This is probably because of shyness—because their talking voices can be heard from a hundred steps away.

The third night's visit was all Jingxing. There are six classes of students there, two of which are male students. Inside, they are all rickshaw pullers of pure color. They all come from different places. Some are residents of this province thousands of miles away, and some are refugees who have wandered thousands of miles away. Among them, they represent the entire national character of our country, and also represent a part of the working class in society. Some are more than 30 years old, and some are youths in their 20s, but because they have no opportunity to study, they will always stand at the post of labor, and live a life like cattle and horses all day long. It is not that they have no relatives in the country, but that no one leads them. According to the results of the investigation, there are 2,340 rickshaw pullers in the city. Except for a few who had received elementary school education when they were young, more than 1,100 others are illiterate laborers, and they are now divided into classes. They all know how to work hard. The training is only two weeks, and they can also read and write publicly. And now they have officially formed a large team, and below they are divided into three squadrons, and they are given further training outside of class, so that they can serve the country in wartime. It is said that there are often evasions when they first go to class. After a strict establishment, they no longer dare to skip school.

The reporter visited here and felt optimistic about the entire people's education. The result of the tutoring is also very hopeful. The city's primary school teachers have suffered a lot and hit a lot of nails, but their price is very great; but with this experience, it is the maids of civil servants and the families of anti-Japanese soldiers that really make them unable to persuade them to go to school. This is a point that the authorities should pay attention to. If the teacher's responsibility is too great and the salary is too small, this is also a point worth improving, because they have already fulfilled the mission of serving the society, and the authorities do not give them a little material comfort, this is the point that can make people discouraged the most. The reporter very much hopes that at the beginning of the second phase, the education authorities can come up with an overall plan to add the experience of Daoci, then the efficiency of the second time will definitely be greater.

### Guangdong Border Actively Deployed Each Battlefield Has Local Contact A Certain Military Expert Observes the Situation

[Special Telegram from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 29th] At the moment, there are no fierce battles in each theater of war, but local contacts are more intense. A certain military expert infers that the second major decisive battle of the war of resistance against Japan is difficult to launch in the short term. Japan seems to have learned from the mistakes of rapid advances and has a tendency to change its battle plan.

Guangdong-Guangxi Border Defense is Safe

[Special Telegram from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 29th] According to reports, Japan is still actively deployed in the Guangdong border, and it seems that it is preparing to launch a general offensive against us by sea, land, and air. We have been closely guarded, and the Guangdong-Guangxi border defense is safe.

[Foreign News from This Port, 29th] According to an unverified message from Guangzhou Bay, Japanese naval marines landed in Anpu on the Leizhou Peninsula yesterday (at the mouth of the Jiuzhou River, more than seventy miles from Lianzhou County). Heavy artillery and explosions can be heard in the Guangzhou Bay area.

[Jiangxi Rapid News from the Awakening Society] After the Jiangxi Japanese army has successively increased its reinforcements, it has recently shown signs of making trouble. In addition to constantly sending Japanese soldiers to harass everywhere and try to attack our army's positions to test our strength, they also forcibly pull the people of our regions to build fortifications and collect bamboo and wood to form rafts in preparation for crossing the river to attack. However, the defenses of various counties in Jiangxi have long been arranged properly, and the strength is exceptionally strong. Now, the local teams in various places have received orders from General Xia Wei, the commander-in-chief of the western route, to launch extensive annihilation of the Japanese guerrilla war in various ways to assist the main force in the counter-offensive.

We Control the Battle Situation in Western Shanxi

[Special Telegram from This Newspaper, Xi'an, 29th] The Japanese army in western Shanxi has repeatedly attacked unsuccessfully. Although both sides have suffered considerable casualties, we have maintained control of the battle situation. The main guerrilla forces are also important, and they use a free form. At the moment, there are many small battles along the Zhongtiao Mountain to the Tongpu line, and there are constant artillery battles along the river. Our infantry and artillery are deployed on the river defense, and the positions are solid.

[Reuters Telegram, Chongqing, 29th] According to a Chinese report, there are still fierce battles in southern Shanxi. The Japanese army in Jixian, west of Linfen, rushed westward to the Yellow River two weeks ago. The Chinese army on the east bank of the Yellow River gathered in Yichuan in Shaanxi Province. The ice floes in the river have all been blown up. The report also said that the Japanese army would attempt to cross the river, but was repelled by the Chinese army with machine guns from across the bank. Another regiment of the Chinese army surrounded its back. As a result of the siege, the Chinese army recovered Jixian and Xiangning.

### Emergency Amidst the Sounds of the North Sea: Guilin Province Thoroughly Destroys Highways; Military Commander Wei Yunsong Discusses the Coastal Situation

— Zhou Gangming

[Guilin Correspondence] The new offensive direction of the enemy is mainly towards the northwest and southwest, in order to cut off our country's external routes. In the southwest, the first to be threatened is of course the line from Beihai to Nanning. Recently, the enemy has concentrated a large force in Beihai and occupied Weizhou Island. This is a prelude to the enemy's landing in Beihai and attacking our southwest. If the enemy attacks the southwest, they will inevitably attack Guangxi and occupy Nanning. Therefore, in the urgent mobilization to stop the enemy's advance and defend Greater Guangxi, the defense arrangements for Guangxi and the southern routes are a very important military matter at present. Recently, Xia Wei, the Chief of Staff of the Fifth Route Army, went to the Beihai area to inspect the defenses, and recently Wei Yunsong, the military commander who had just been transferred back to Guangxi from the front line, went to the Wuzhou and Rongxian areas to inspect, and thoroughly destroyed the highway lines in this area, in order to prevent the enemy's mechanized units from advancing during the attack.

There are now several highways planned for destruction, all of which could be used by the enemy when they attack Guangxi. The destruction was originally not very thorough, but after Military Commander Wei's inspection, he telegraphed to various militia districts and counties to carry out thorough destruction. The highways in the fields will be dug up and turned into paddy fields, and the highways in the mountains will be completely cut off and leveled. Currently, the masses responsible for destroying the highways are paid four jiao per day for food by the government.

In a very ordinary farmhouse, which is the military headquarters of a certain army, I saw General Wei Yunsong. He is a middle-aged man in his late forties, quite tall, with a large frame, and a brown-yellow complexion. General Wei still retains a pure and honest peasant temperament. People all call him an ordinary citizen, which is a well-deserved title.

He said, "Others always think that highways should only be destroyed when necessary. In my opinion, that's not right. Because once the highways are destroyed, the enemy will know not to come. The enemy's strength lies in the superiority of their weapons, such as tanks, armored vehicles, heavy artillery, and heavy weapons. Once the highways are destroyed, the enemy's heavy weapons will not be able to come easily. Without the support of heavy weapons, the enemy will not come. Even if they do come, they will have to repair the roads. For example, from Rongxu to Rongxian, this 300-li road can be reached in a few hours by highway, but after the destruction, it will take nine months to repair. Even if the enemy's engineers are skilled, it will still take five months to repair. So, in terms of seizing time to achieve seizing space, we can achieve the goal of consuming the enemy and achieving a protracted war. But some people say that highways should only be destroyed when necessary. If we destroy them in advance, we won't be able to use them to transport supplies. Regarding this argument, we need to ask whether it is possible for us to use cars to transport troops now, whether we have gasoline after we have cars. We are now fighting the enemy, and we are familiar with the terrain in our own territory. We know which points are easy to defend, and we can transport ammunition there in advance and deploy it well. Although highways can quickly transport troops during wartime, after the destruction, we can transport the wounded several li to the sides, which can also achieve the purpose of speed. Therefore, if the highways are left until necessary to destroy, we will use them less, and the enemy will use them more. Although we have no highways during wartime, we have civilian transportation, while the enemy has no coolies and relies entirely on vehicles for transportation. After the roads are destroyed, they will have no way to transport supplies.

In addition, some people only destroy some bridges when destroying highways, and consider it done. That is not acceptable. Based on the experience of fighting for the past year, the enemy's engineers are skilled and have plenty of materials. They can use rubber boats and rubber piles to build bridges quickly and allow their mechanized units to cross. Because of the above situation, some troops on the front line often suffer losses, thinking that the bridges on the transportation lines have been destroyed and they can retreat slowly, but as a result, the enemy quickly repairs the transportation lines and catches up with mechanized units, so they often suffer losses from the enemy. Therefore, it is difficult to say that highways should be left until necessary to destroy, Guangxi civilians are more organized and can destroy them when necessary, but at that time the enemy planes come to bomb and the civilians flee, so how easy is it to destroy them when necessary?

Now that the highways are destroyed, even if the enemy comes, they will have to walk. At the same time, their heavy weapons and mechanized units cannot come. Only infantry can come. For infantry to come is for the enemy to use their weakness. When the roads are good, the enemy can use their mechanized strengths. If the enemy infantry comes, we are familiar with the terrain and can use our strengths, using guerrilla warfare to annihilate the enemy.

As for destroying transportation lines, we must thoroughly destroy the roadbed and dig the mud into paddy fields, but the bridges can still be preserved. Only dig the mud, because mud on the transportation line is a matter of labor, and building bridges is a matter of technology. The enemy has abundant technology and materials for building bridges and can do it easily, but mud is a matter of labor. They have to carry it one load at a time, and the enemy will not carry mud. Our civilians will not carry mud for the enemy. Even if the enemy can carry mud, the loose mud will still not be able to carry heavy weapons and mechanized equipment, and they will be trapped in the mud. Therefore, if the enemy comes, they will have to repair the roads, which will take a long time, and we can strive for a protracted war. This is the experience we have gained from fighting for fourteen months. I already had this suggestion when fighting in Shanghai. The best example is that after the destruction of the highways in Zhejiang, the enemy is currently having great difficulty advancing. The railway from Jiujiang to Nanchang was completely destroyed, and the enemy's invasion is also extremely difficult. This does not mean that the enemy does not want to capture Zhejiang, but that it is not easy for them to advance, which can strive for a protracted war, allowing civilians to live and work in peace, produce, and increase new strength and new troops. Therefore, thoroughly destroying the transportation in the near war zone is not only to prevent the enemy from invading, but is also closely related to the entire protracted war and comprehensive war, and is closely coordinated with guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare. Consuming the enemy through a protracted war, increasing the enemy's economic panic and difficulties, and at the same time striving for changes in favorable international conditions, so that we can cultivate new combat power through self-reliance and prepare our new counter-offensive power."

He spoke very thoroughly and clearly. The reporter then asked how he estimated the current tense situation in Beihai and the enemy's invasion of Guangxi. He replied to the reporter in a leisurely and沉稳 manner, "If the enemy invades Guangxi, there are four routes: one from Beihai to Nanning, one from Chikan (Guangzhou Bay) to Yulin, one from Sanshui in the West River to Wuzhou, and one from Guangning and Huaiji to Hexian. But after the enemy troops attacked Sanshui and blocked the exit from Fuzhou, Wuzhou is equivalent to a dead city. After the highways from Yulin to Guangzhou Bay and from Guangning to He were destroyed, the enemy will not come. Now, only the Yongqin Line, the road from Beihai to Nanning, is left, perhaps the enemy is trying to cut off our international routes." He then added, "If the enemy occupies Weizhou Island, they will gain a land airfield, perhaps the enemy will send planes to harass and bomb Guangxi's transportation lines from time to time, just like they bombed the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and the Yuehan Railway before. This is possible."

Then we talked about many more questions, and Military Commander Wei explained them very carefully. Finally, he politely saw me out the door. The reporter was very happy and gained a very accurate understanding of the issue. (Guilin, January 22nd)

### Madame Tabouis Makes a Shocking Announcement: Germany Will Aid Italy in Attacking France; Talks in Rome Only Yield Threats

[Telegraph from London, 28th] The famous French journalist Madame Tabouis made a shocking announcement, saying that Hitler will announce to the Reichstag on Tuesday that Germany supports Italy's territorial demands on France. On February 4th, Mussolini will present France with a stinging letter and claim that the British Prime Minister's visit to Italy has shattered Britain's years of illusions. Italy has decided not to negotiate small matters anymore, but wants to make a major offer first and then accept a smaller counter-offer. Italy has seen that the unity of Britain and France is very solid, and the actions taken in the next few days will affect the future of Europe. More than half of the French ministers believe that Italy, even without German aid, can attack France if it alone completes the conquest of Abyssinia. However, the French parliament believes that the power to issue orders is still in Hitler's hands. When Chamberlain went to Italy, he had no chance to express many opinions. The talks were entirely based on Mussolini's own ideas, one on French issues and one on Spanish issues. His arrogance allowed Chamberlain no room to speak. On Wednesday (the 11th of this month) and Thursday (the 12th of this month), although Mussolini did not make any territorial or other demands, it was shocking when he severely scolded France in front of Chamberlain. Mussolini viewed France as the source of European disaster, due to France's signing of the Franco-Soviet pact, France's military build-up, the prolongation of the Western War, the destruction of world commerce, and the disturbances in the Near East. France should be held responsible for all of this. Unless France's spine is broken, peace is impossible. This is Mussolini's view of France. Even if Chamberlain had the power to mediate between Italy and France, he could not fulfill it. He was shocked by Mussolini's absurd attacks, remained silent, and was as stiff as a wooden chicken, only saying that if Italy was willing to discuss legal issues with France, it should greatly reduce its fierce attacks on France. He also adopted this arrogant attitude on the Spanish issue. Chamberlain said that he did not know about the so-called Four-Power Conference. He considered the idea of mediation to be absurd and ridiculous, and that Italy's victory was only a matter of weeks. He also said that he was extremely opposed to the re-establishment of the monarchy in Spain. Mussolini also revealed that after Italy's victory in Spain and the situation changed, new British-Italian negotiations would be necessary. This is the whole truth of the British-Italian talks. Chamberlain had a bad cold while in Rome, and Mussolini showed unusual coldness towards Chamberlain in public. On the last day, Mussolini even went to the countryside to ice skate, disregarding his distinguished guest. During Chamberlain's visit to Rome, the important talks were held between the two foreign ministers, Halifax and Ciano. Foreign Minister Ciano first revealed Italy's intentions towards Spain, which the opposition parties in both Britain and France have been trying to make their governments understand for years without success. Ciano said that even after Franco's victory, Italian troops would still remain in Spain, and this was also the first time that Britain understood that Italy's demand for Tunisia was an excuse for Italy to retain its occupation of the Balearic Islands (originally Spanish in the Mediterranean) after the war. As long as the Tunisian issue is not resolved, we will not leave the Balearic Islands for a day. This is the information that Ciano revealed to Halifax. What Ciano did not say but can be confirmed by German military sources is that although Franco is making great military progress at the moment, he is still unable to completely conquer the government forces. This matter has more serious implications. At present, both Italy and Germany do not want the Western War to end immediately. This is waiting for orders from Berlin and Rome. Once the entire territory of Spain is conquered, they will attack France. Currently, there are 30,000 Germans and Italians in the West, preparing to attack France. Hitler was very satisfied with Mussolini's attitude towards Chamberlain. Hitler also expressed his willingness to aid Mussolini with force in order to force Britain and France to concede to colonial demands.

### After the Bombing of Jiangmen: Some Citizens Evacuate, Business Slightly Declines

[Jiangmen Express News from the Awakening Society] Jiangmen City, Xinhui, suffered a frenzied bombing by enemy planes on the 27th, destroying houses and killing and wounding many people (the disaster has been reported in the newspaper). After the tragic incident occurred, the people in the city moved out one after another and returned to nearby villages to live. On the day the enemy planes dropped bombs, they all fell on the riverbank, destroying many boats. There were originally more than 200 boats docked there for overnight stays. The boat owners saw that the embankment had been bombed and was desolate, and in order to avoid further frenzied bombing by enemy planes, they moved their boats to Baisa, Lile, and other river bends that night, either operating as usual or stopping receiving guests and accommodation. All ferry passengers going to various places from Jiangmen were extremely crowded. On the evening of the 27th, the Longshui ferry was extremely crowded. The Jiangmen Rongqi Zhongyuan ferry arrived early in the morning and left the Jiangmen embankment to find a safe place to dock. In the afternoon, it still operated as usual. The Mu Jiangmen Qianshan electric boat also moved to the vicinity of Baisa. The situation in the city is that, except for business being slightly depressed, most of the residents have left the city. The Hailou teahouse still operates as usual. In order to save their capital, the shop owners collect money upon delivery for both dim sum and tea. The fare for rickshaws in the city has doubled, because after the frenzied bombing, the people have become birds startled by the twang of a bow, and upon hearing an alarm, they hire rickshaws to flee to the suburbs.

All undertakings have meticulous and appropriate measures to adapt to the war of resistance.

### Bank of China and Bank of Communications Establish Large-Scale Textile Mill in Yunnan; Headed by Song Ziwen, Qian Xinzhi, etc.; Western Development is Progressing Steadily

[Special News from this newspaper] Since the war of resistance entered the second stage, our authorities have been actively promoting the development of the rich resources of the southwest and northwest, sparing no effort. Reclaiming wasteland and developing transportation, they especially focus on the construction of industry. On the one hand, the government allocates funds to operate, and on the other hand, it encourages the financial community and overseas Chinese to actively invest. According to news from the economic circles in Hong Kong, the authorities recently established the Southwest Economic Construction Committee, allocated 20 million yuan, and are implementing various development plans in earnest. It can be seen that the central government attaches great importance to the development of the rich resources of the west. It is estimated that the groups and individuals currently investing in national construction industries include the Huaxi Reclamation Company organized by Huang Xiufeng and others, with a capital of 5 million yuan, which is currently actively underway; the Dahua Industrial Company organized by Liu Wenhui, with a capital of 10 million yuan, specializing in the development of the rich resources of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Xikang; and Hu Wenhu also attaches great importance to the development of Yunnan's resources, and it is said that he has decided to invest 30 million yuan to handle it. As for other banks, both official and commercial, and foreign merchants from Britain and the United States, their investment in the reclamation and construction of the west is also very active. Therefore, the west of China has now become the birthplace of the new China, full of vigor and a promising symbol of the future.

After the fall of Shanghai, many Chinese-owned textile mills went bankrupt. Most of the textile mills run by Chinese merchants were located in the war zone and were subsequently occupied by the enemy. At the same time, Japanese-owned textile mills in Hongkou, Caojiabo, and other places were also reviving and producing in large quantities, selling to the interior. Chinese and foreign textile mills cannot compete with them, so Central China and South China have become Japanese yarn markets. Seeing this, the financial community in our country believes that since the authorities are actively building in the southwest, they should find ways to stop this leakage and avoid using funds to subsidize the enemy. Therefore, the head offices of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, together with the Fudian New Bank, have decided to raise funds to establish a large-scale textile mill in Kunming, also engaged in dyeing and weaving, planning to install 25,000 spindles. Currently, a preparatory committee has been established, headed by Song Ziwen and Qian Xinzhi. In order to understand the current status of the preparations, the reporter visited Zheng Tieru, the director of the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China, yesterday and asked about everything. According to him, the organization and implementation of the textile mill are probably being handled by the Kunming branch of the Bank of China and the Kunming Fudian New Bank, and they are very active. In the near future, it should be completed.

[Reuters Chongqing, 29th] Mr. Hu Wenhu is now establishing a company with a capital of 50 million yuan on the border of Lingnan, which has been approved by Yunnan Provincial Chairman Long Yun. The company's address has been designated as a model area. The company will be divided into mining and reclamation departments.

### The Youth Dare-to-Die Corps Active in Western Shanxi …Fenxi Correspondence…

The Youth Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps is a newly emerging force on the Shanxi battlefield. In the year since the war of resistance began, it has been active in every corner of the Shanxi battlefield, repeatedly striking at the frenzied attacks of the enemy bandits. Although it has only been a little over a year since its inception, in this short year, in the process of carrying out the great War of Resistance Against Japan, while striking at the enemy bandits and enriching itself, it has rapidly grown stronger and become the only formidable enemy in the eyes of the enemy bandits. When the enemy bandits besieged southern and northern Shanxi several times, it always cooperated with the regular army to fight the enemy bandits to the death. Since this spring, with the expansion of our vast guerrilla warfare, the Dare-to-Die Corps has been able to automatically attack the enemy bandits, making them feel that it is the most "棘手" and formidable enemy operating in Shanxi. Here, we will briefly describe the combat record and current situation of the ×th Column of the Dare-to-Die Corps active in the Lüliang Mountains.

This force, when it was born last month of last year, was only a single basic general unit. However, after a year of battles, it has developed into the current strong and massive force. This cannot but be attributed to the effectiveness of its political work.

Like other units, the greatest task of the Dare-to-Die Corps is to constantly strike and contain the enemy bandits, so as to gradually consolidate and expand the anti-Japanese guerrilla base area in the Lüliang Mountains surrounded by the enemy bandits. In the guerrilla warfare of the past year, starting from February 7th of this year, it began to severely strike the fierce siege of the Japanese bandits with unparalleled bravery. Relying on the Tongpu Railway along the Fen River, it was also often relentlessly destroyed by the Youth Dare-to-Die Corps with the help of the masses. In May, it also cooperated with the Battle of the Jinpu Railway, making every effort to contain and hinder the enemy bandits' reinforcements to Jinpu. In June, at the perilous peaks of the Houling Mountains, it destroyed more than forty vehicles of the enemy bandits and thoroughly destroyed the motor vehicle road. Even today, the enemy bandits have not fully recovered, and traffic is still blocked. It has besieged the enemy bandits on the railway line and in the cities, threatening their freedom of movement and all kinds of evil activities. They have not only annihilated a large number of enemy bandits and puppet troops, but also used the power of political propaganda to constantly instigate the mutiny and disintegration of the puppet troops, and raised the tide of the anti-war movement in the enemy's camp. The fact that thirty-three workers revolted at the Motou military station in Zhaocheng on December 5th is a practical achievement of their work against the enemy. The spirit of the Youth Dare-to-Die Corps' heroic fighting has been praised by people from all walks of life and friendly anti-Japanese forces, and it is especially deeply impressed in the minds of the masses. They often defeat enemy bandits with superior numbers and equipment with very few people. On November 21st, they were attacked by two thousand enemy bandits in six directions in Shipicun, Huoxian County. As a result, fifteen heroic soldiers cleverly repelled four waves of attack from one thousand enemy bandits, inflicting a shameful and miserable defeat on the attacking enemy bandits with a casualty ratio of two to forty. On November 23rd, a worker of the Dare-to-Die Corps, with eight newly joined young soldiers who had not received military training and six dilapidated rifles, attacked the enemy bandits in the eastern suburbs of Xiaoyi. Apart from our slight losses, we also seized back several pack donkeys and a very beautiful horse.

In the past year, the ×th Column's attacks and annihilation of the enemy bandits have not only kept the vast area of the Lüliang Mountains in our hands, but also maintained the strong establishment of our anti-Japanese national revolutionary regime, protected the lives and property of the people, and consolidated the foundation of the anti-Japanese guerrilla base area in the Lüliang Mountains. In addition, the heroic and exemplary fighting spirit of the Dare-to-Die Corps has further enhanced the anti-war mood of the masses and increased the courage of all friendly anti-Japanese forces to fight against the defeatist sentiment.

In addition to fighting, they also study literacy and political issues, and regularly hold problem discussion meetings and life group meetings, just like a school. In addition to these tasks, each general team organizes a political work team, which regularly performs dramas in the teams. Therefore, they can constantly see vivid dramas, lively dances, and hear majestic songs and popular drum lyrics and ditties. All the soldiers love to sing tragic songs, and the songs of national salvation spread with them to the vast villages and fields.

When they march to a place, they hold a military-civilian get-together and perform dramas at the same time, quickly organizing the masses separately, teaching them to sing, and providing them with war news. In these tasks of publicizing and organizing the masses, each member of the team keeps in mind and faithfully executes their "Three Major Principles and Eight Points of Attention." First of all, they can respect the interests of the masses, and will not deliberately damage even a single grass or tree of the masses. This is the only reason why the common people never hate or fear them. They have received the enthusiastic support of the broad masses. The common people everywhere give them the best houses to live in, are happy to distribute petty items to them, and ask them not to leave again.

Since the fall of Guangzhou and the retreat from Wuhan, the enemy bandits have begun to besiege the guerrilla areas. The Youth Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps has made preparations in many ways to counter the new offensive of the enemy bandits. They are making their greatest efforts to fight against the frenzied offensive of the Japanese bandits and win victory.

### British Cabinet Reorganization Completed, Seeking Peace, Striving to Expand the Military, Hoping Germany and Italy Can Also Contribute, Chamberlain's Speech

[Reuters, London, 28th] The British Cabinet officially announced the successful reorganization last night. What is noteworthy in this reorganization is that another young cabinet member resigned. Sheffield was appointed Minister of Defense Coordination. The original Minister of the Ministry, Inskip, was transferred to Minister of the Dominions. Colonel Regis Norman Smith was appointed Minister of Agriculture. Morrison was appointed Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The original minister, Lord Winterton, was transferred to Comptroller General without salary. Under-Secretary of the Army Lord Strathcona resigned, and his vacancy was filled by the former Comptroller General. Sheffield's succession to Inskip as Minister of Defense Coordination has been under attack by the opposition and some members of the Conservative Party for a long time. It is understood that Shadfield once served as Commander of the First Fleet and Chief of Naval Staff. Inskip's transfer to Minister of the Dominions is to share the heavy responsibilities of MacDonald, because since the death of Lord Stanley in October last year, MacDonald has concurrently served as Minister of the Colonies and Minister of the Dominions. MacDonald is now exclusively Minister of the Colonies. Regis Norman Smith is a newcomer to the cabinet. His appointment as Minister of Agriculture seems very competent. He served as Chairman of the National Farmers' Association from 1936 to 1937. Since 1935, he has been a member of the House of Commons representing the Petersfield District of Hampshire. It has been rumored for a long time that Morrison resigned as Minister of Agriculture. The people of the country have demanded that he resign because they are very dissatisfied with the government's agricultural policy and believe that Morrison cannot escape his blame. Morrison succeeded Lord Winterton as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a position that is usually not included in the Cabinet. Morrison will assist Sheffield and represent Sheffield in the House of Commons. When Winterton previously held the position, he was included in the Cabinet for the purpose of being responsible for air defense. His tenure in the position was considered a failure and has been taken over by Lord Anderson, the Lord Privy Seal. What is most noteworthy in this cabinet reorganization is the resignation of Under-Secretary of the Army Strathcona. He is one of the young cabinet members. In the past few months, he opposed the Secretary of War and publicly criticized the Secretary of War for the chaos of air defense and that the Secretary of War should be held responsible. Those who criticized Bailey with him also included Lord Chatfield and Under-Secretary of the Colonial Department, Yawa, and Overseas Trade Minister Hudson.

Chamberlain's Speech

[Reuters, London, 28th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech at the banquet of the "Jewellers' Association" in Birmingham today, saying, "If the Anglo-Italian relations are not improved, then I will never be able to obtain Mussolini's cooperation in September last year. If Mo had not cooperated, I would not have believed that peace could be preserved. The problem in Europe last year almost caused the world to encounter the most tragic disaster. I took personal action to seek a reconciliation of the problem. Those who are willing to attack the Munich Agreement and my actions at that time are really numerous. The sources of criticism are different, but all critics have one thing in common, that is, none of them have shouldered the responsibilities like me, and none of them fully understands the situation at that time, because this kind of inside story is only known to the government. Therefore, when I look back on the past, I don't feel any regret, and I haven't found any reason to prove that other better policies should have been adopted at that time. Modern warfare is so cruel to the belligerent countries, and the losses suffered by the countries that are temporarily watching from the sidelines are so great, so we must not let the war start, unless all the glorious steps that can prevent the war have been exhausted, and they still do not work. The British government has held this view from the beginning, and our policy of peace has not been shaken so far. The so-called Munich Agreement is just an occasional fact when implementing this policy. Moreover, I have to say that the reason why European peace was fortunately preserved in September last year was because I exchanged letters with Mussolini in the summer of 1937, and in February 1938, the Anglo-Italian Agreement was established. If the relations between Britain and Italy had not been improved earlier, then I would never have been able to obtain Mo's cooperation in September last year. Without Mo's determination, I want to use all means to prevent the people of Britain and Italy from achieving their heartfelt desire. This desire refers to the spirit of friendship and peaceful coexistence between the two sides. Even if there are different opinions, they should be resolved through negotiations instead of resorting to force. This is not only the case for Britain and Italy, but also for France and Germany. We should cultivate friendship between countries. Not only official representatives can work hard in this regard, but also individuals or businessmen can work together. We are willing to tell people of all countries that we do not regard them as imaginary enemies. On the contrary, we believe that they are members of the human race, so we are always prepared to negotiate with them on equal terms, and we are willing to listen to their opinions with an open mind. If they have any reasonable desires that are contrary to the right of freedom and justice required by people and others, we are also willing to satisfy them as much as possible. There are some external toxins in the international air. If we want to clarify them and restore psychological security and trust, we will not succeed without following the above-mentioned policies. To achieve any international undertaking, this kind of security and trust is its "blood for maintaining life." We should not forget that the establishment of peace requires at least two people, but the outbreak of war is enough for one person. If we cannot obtain some clear understanding between countries and eliminate all political tensions, we cannot but prepare to defend ourselves against foreign aggression. The object of this aggression can be our land, or our compatriots, or even our freedom. We believe that the existence of democratic politics is closely related to the principle of freedom, and we feel that the highest meaning of life is also nurtured in freedom. Therefore, although we have obtained the unanimous support of the national public opinion and worked hard to expand the military, the purpose is to defend ourselves, not to invade. The time spent expanding the military in the past has been a lot, but up to now, it has accelerated, and it is proceeding simultaneously in all directions." At this point, Zhang gave a detailed explanation of the progress of the navy, army and air force in the fiscal year up to the end of March this year. Sixty new warships of various types with a total tonnage of 130,000 tons will be incorporated into the navy. In the following twelve months, about seventy-five new warships of various types can be launched. The expansion of the air force is also equally rapid. In recent months, the rate of aircraft manufacturing has doubled, and the recruitment of air force personnel has also been good. In September last year, air defense facilities were obviously lacking, but now they have been remedied and greatly improved. This does not only refer to the increase in the number of anti-aircraft guns, but also refers to the internal organization. Zhang then elaborated on the "National Civilian Volunteer Service," saying, "If we are involved in the war, we will find that even if we are not on the front line, we can be reached by enemy artillery fire. Now, in order to prevent this danger, the people of the country have a new opportunity to work hard for national defense. We just don't want to build a huge national defense force and incorporate it into a team similar to the wartime 'professional army'. We are only making certain positions responsible for the ancestors, and we are not getting jobs for all the people. We have to prepare for war and sacrifice so much time and national efforts. It is regrettable. I feel that other countries are willing to work hard for peace. This is the time. Today, the international air is full of rumors and suspicions. It should not be allowed to exist for a long time. As President Roosevelt said in his 'New Year's Message', if someone wants to control the world by force, it is a threat to peace. If there is such a request, then Luo and I have both said that democratic countries will resolutely resist it. However, I still do not believe that any country really has the intention to challenge this, because the consequences of the war are too serious, and no country wants to be involved in it. I always believe that no matter how serious the international conflict is, it can be resolved according to the negotiation and consultation methods stipulated in the Munich Agreement, and there is no need to resort to war." Zhang also explained the civil defense plan, saying, "We ask people to volunteer their services. I don't care about the results, because the spirit of service of our people has always existed, and it has never been as strong as it is today. Our motto is 'Neither arrogant nor humble, only self-defense'. We are confident that our people will actively respond to the government's call to express their determination to make this kind of self-defense invincible in the world." Finally, Zhang also talked about his trip to Rome, saying, "We went to Rome in order to further understand the opinions of Italian politicians, so that they can also clearly understand our position. All of this has been done. Although both sides expressed their opinions frankly, they never forced others to follow their own opinions. I dare say that our friendship after leaving Fuma is deeper than when we went to Zama."

The United States and France Express Welcome

[Reuters, London, 29th] A London news reporter, in stating the Prime Minister's speech, especially pointed out that our attitude has been clarified without any doubt. Now, what remains to be seen is that others are willing to assist. This statement refers to Chamberlain's another request for a "guarantee", waiting for Hitler's speech in Congress on Monday. The Times said on Monday, "The Prime Minister has now reiterated the purpose of the Anglo-German Munich Agreement, hoping that Hitler will also remain loyal, because only in this way can the future and light of Europe be maintained." The observer said, "The Sudetenland region is obviously different from the British and French mainland. If we conceal our anxious emotions and the determination to deal with aggression today, it is a great fault."

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] Here, Chamberlain's speech was welcomed with unexpected surprise, believing that it contained a firm stance against international intimidation. People close to the government believe that no matter how the overall situation develops, Chamberlain will always be optimistic. However, it was not long after Zhang had read Mussolini's speech, wishing the Western rebel army victory, that Zhang had again read Mussolini, which aroused some surprise. As a result of the victory of the Fascists in Spain, the threat to Britain and France in the Mediterranean, and the oppression of France on three sides, most people hope that Zhang's optimism can be fully implemented.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 29th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech was delivered with a spirit of moderation and compromise, but at the same time, the wording was extremely firm. People here welcomed it very much, believing that it was comparable to the speech given by Prime Minister Daladi in the House of Representatives a few days ago. Chamberlain's speech expressed friendship to Italy, which is the same as Daladi's speech. At the same time, Zhang expressed his belief that France and Germany still have the possibility of holding consultations. Zhang Li said that it is necessary to expand the military and strengthen national defense to maintain peace, which is the same as Daladi's speech. In Zhang's speech, he hoped that Germany and Italy could also contribute to world peace. This level is deeply hoped here that Germany and Italy can express themselves, and when Hitler and Mussolini deliver speeches, they will respond. The democratic countries have successively issued final warnings, that is, any attempt to rule the world by violence will be resisted by all democratic countries.

### Oxford University Vice-Chancellor Sympathizes with Chinese Universities, Calling on British Universities to Cooperate, Donating Funds to Supply Books and Stationery

[Reuters, London, 28th] Oxford University Chancellor Gordon wrote to The Times today, appealing on behalf of major Chinese universities. Gordon said, "The colleagues of Oxford University express their deep sympathy for the bombing and destruction of Chinese universities by Japanese aircraft, because most universities have been forced to move to remote inland areas and continue their traditional national education under the lack of books and equipment. We have a companion and research obligation to them, just like to the University of Leuven in Belgium after the war and to Tokyo Imperial University in 1923. The International Student Service has completed its good relief work, and the United Board for Christian Higher Education in China has also done its best for the twelve Christian universities. We now propose to cooperate with the two groups and the Chinese University Committee to do our best to lend books and equipment. This fund has now received 2,000 pounds. If each university can donate something, the number can be increased to 3,000 pounds. Cooperation can achieve good results. Oxford University is now sincerely cooperating with domestic universities and related groups."

### Spanish Refugees Flood into French Territory, the French Government Has Ordered the Repatriation of Spanish Strong Men

[Haitong News Agency, Genoa, 29th] The Ministry of National Defense of the Western Republican Government issued a military report last night, (1) On the Catalan Line, the government army in eastern Solsuna and Vannissa defeated the enemy army and retreated with heavy losses. Currently, the Mataro area is still in fierce fighting. (2) On the Estarimadula Line, the enemy army attacked the Monte Laobio and Saint Duvejinna districts, and was repelled. Two enemy planes were shot down. There is nothing to report on the other lines.

[Reuters, Pierbinan, 29th] The French government issued an order last night, "All strong men of military service age entering from Spain will be repatriated." When this order was received, several refugees had already boarded the train, preparing to go inland. The French military police had to use force to force them to return to the country. Some people strongly opposed this, saying that they would rather die than be captured by the rebel army. Only women, children, the elderly and the weak were allowed to enter last night, but the latest news said that the strong men of military service age who had entered the country were allowed to stay in France temporarily, but no one would be allowed to enter again.

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] The French Cabinet meeting decided that if any Spanish government army went to France and voluntarily returned to Franco's occupied area, France would allow them to return to the country. Conversely, if they would rather stay in France, they must be detained in the barracks. It is generally believed that Pope Pius and other famous people have asked Franco to be merciful and issue a declaration to all civilians who have fled into exile, asking them to return to their homeland without being retaliated against. At the same time, thousands of Spanish refugees (most of whom are women and children) are now gathered on the border between La Jonquila and Le Panchees six miles away, while two government forces, each with 6,000 people, are collapsing towards the French border town of Platt Ro. There are also more than a thousand refugees (including 200 armed militiamen) who crossed the Le Panche border and are now being transported by train to the French interior. The French authorities have added regular troops and foreign volunteer soldiers to increase the strength of the border defense forces, but the influx of refugees is not being prevented.

[Reuters, Pan Binan, 29th] Spanish refugees are fleeing to the French border. The military authorities have taken steps to maintain law and order. The railway authorities are preparing to transport 4,000 refugees. Hundreds of other refugees are spending the night in the Serri (Spanish end of the international tunnel) to avoid the cold, and then entering France along a small road.

[Reuters, Paris, 29th] Last night, there were several small-scale demonstrations demanding the opening of the borders between France and the two countries. A large number of guards have been gathered and stationed at key points in the city. As a result of the demonstration, 500 people have been arrested, and some of them will be charged with insulting police and carrying weapons.

[Reuters, Paris, 28th] When Finance Minister Renault gave a speech on the effectiveness of fiscal policy last night, countless tons of gold flowed into France, and France will be able to purchase 5,000 extremely modern aircraft from abroad in the future. After Renault reported on the new situation of France's prosperity, he continued, "The recovery has now been completed. Thanks to your devotion to public service and law-abiding, France's face in the world has been completely changed. What we can say is that although France does not despise any country, it does not fear any country. If the people of France remain calm and understand how firm we are, I can guarantee that some countries will definitely understand that it is better to do something better than to engage in war. The recovered France can resist any country today, but the future France is willing to cooperate with every country."

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 29th] French Chief of Naval Staff Danlan arrived in Rosabiranga, North Africa, Morocco yesterday morning on the cruiser "Batin". The local Xiaoyou King welcomed him with national ceremonies and hosted a luncheon. During the banquet, he told Danlan that the residents of Morocco have always been loyal to protect France.

### British Cabinet Partial Reshuffle and British and French Military Build-up

According to a London dispatch on the 28th, the British cabinet is undergoing a partial reshuffle. Gadfield succeeds as Minister of National Defense. British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech stating that Britain will seek international cooperation and actively carry out military build-up to prepare for war. According to a Paris dispatch on the same day, France, in view of the serious situation in Europe, is actively preparing to strengthen its national defense and will extend the term of military service from two years to twenty-seven months. Do these few pieces of news indicate that the British and French authorities, under the threat of the advancing Germany and Italy, are beginning to realize the necessity of preparing for a counterattack?

At a time when the three fascist aggressors of Germany, Italy, and Japan are madly advancing a new imperialist war, the peaceful democratic countries, especially Britain and France, can only guarantee their own security and their inherent position in the world by uniting with countries such as the Soviet Union and the United States to sanction fascist aggressor countries with strength. This is self-evident. However, the power of the British and French governments is not in the hands of the people of Britain and France or the progressive parties representing the people, but is controlled by a few financial capitalist leaders and their agents. These people, despite their fine words, for the country, for the people, and for peace, are actually cooperating with fascist aggression ××, using the expansion of war to develop wealth. What they oppose most is the masses of the people gaining power. What they hate most is the precedent of the Soviet Union's liberation for the oppressed masses of the world. They are most unwilling to unite the peaceful democratic countries to overthrow the fascist aggression ×× and the vast people's free and happy world after that. They fear that there will be no possibility of monopolizing profits at that time. Therefore, they oppose democracy and progress in every possible way and want to promote fascist aggression.

Is the current British cabinet reshuffle a reshuffle of the ruling class? Is the military build-up in Britain and France out of determination to sanction fascist aggressors? Of course, it is highly doubtful. At most, it is only because the people of the two countries have already made this request and have coalesced into an action, so they have to "take this measure." We are not saying that Britain and France have no possibility of adopting this policy now, and we believe that the domestic and foreign situations in Britain and France are forcing them to adopt a progressive policy of defending democracy and peace with strength. However, we cannot just look at the so-called partial reshuffle and the so-called declaration of preparedness for war, but we must pay attention to their actual actions to sanction fascist aggression, and we must organize the broad masses of the people to promote their implementation of this step.

### × Occupation of the Xisha Islands Plan

Reuters in London reported on the 28th that the Japanese authorities are planning to invade and occupy the Xisha Islands. This news can be viewed in connection with the occupation of Barcelona by the Italian expeditionary force. The reason why the Italian aggressors were victorious in Spain, and will even join forces with German fascists to further invade France itself, is entirely the inevitable result of France's following a policy of appeasement and making concessions to aggressors and bribing small and weak countries. This policy of retreat and bribery in Europe has indeed encouraged the aggressors, and at the same time, it cannot stop the covetousness of the Eastern aggressors—now Japan's plan to attack southward is gradually approaching, and its target is no longer limited to Wuzhou and Nanning, but also includes the entire territory from Tokyo Bay, the Indian Ocean to Southeast Asia—the occupation of the Xisha Islands is just a small hint of the advance. It can be seen that in order to effectively protect the Far East rights and interests of France and even Britain, the policy of retreat and bribery to aggressors must first be abandoned.

### Sky Peace Front

In this war-torn world, there have also been many gratifying news items in the past few days. Among them, what is particularly noteworthy is that, according to a Chongqing dispatch on the 27th, the Sino-British joint aviation transport will fly from London to Chongqing within the next five days, and will then fly according to the prescribed schedule, making transportation between Britain and Chongqing more convenient. As for the line between China and Myanmar, it will also be completed soon. At the same time, according to government sources, the Chinese and Soviet authorities will also organize a line from Moscow to Chongqing to facilitate Northwest transportation. If night flights can be used, it will be possible to reach Moscow directly from Chongqing within 40 hours. In addition, US President Roosevelt announced on the 27th that US aircraft manufacturers have obtained government approval to supply France with an unlimited number of aircraft. What is the significance of this news? First, we can see that the contact between the several peace-loving countries of China, Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and France has become closer under the threat of the evil demons of Eastern and Western aggression. Second, because air transportation will have a decisive influence on the outcome of the war in the future, the development of general air communication by these peace-loving countries may still be the prelude to the Sky Peace Front. We hope to further consolidate and expand the global anti-fascist and anti-aggression front through the completion of the Sky Peace Chen Line.

### Comparison of US Munitions Supplies to China and Japan in the Past Year

— Author VIGINA THOMPSON
Translated by Bao Ren from the December 27th issue of the New York FAR EASTERN SURVEY weekly

According to the latest bulletin from the US Bureau of Foreign Trade, the value of US munitions exports to the Far East decreased significantly in 1938. In China, because the coastal provinces were occupied by the Japanese army and important transportation routes were cut off, munitions could not be transported. In Japan, because US President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull advised munitions dealers and aircraft factories not to sell munitions and aircraft to Japan, the munitions trade between Japan and the US also gradually decreased during the year.

The amount of US imports of military supplies to China (excluding firearms and ammunition) fluctuated during the year, showing an irregular phenomenon. It reached US$2,500,000 in the first month, US$2,000,000 in the second month, and dropped to US$150,000 in the third month. However, in April, it suddenly increased to US$2,527,161, breaking the previous record. In May, it decreased to US$523,298, and in June it increased slightly, worth US$1,236,020. In July, it was only worth US$164,698, and in August it was worth US$122,448. It increased slightly in September and October, totaling US$706,135. In November, it decreased to US$1,949.

As for the practical military equipment (shells, aircraft, etc.) supplied by the US to China, the situation was even worse. In June 1938, it was worth US$2,212,000, in July it was worth US$937,000, in August it was worth US$299,000, in September it was worth US$99,000, and in October it even decreased to US$49,000. The Chinese government used most of the above amounts to purchase aircraft.

On the Japanese side, undoubtedly, Japan's disregard for international credibility, violation of peace treaties, and contempt for US rights and interests in China have aroused a deeply rooted anti-Japanese concept in the US government and people. Most of the domestic munitions dealers have automatically adopted a passive and uncooperative attitude towards Japan. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull repeatedly stated in July this year that he would dissuade the interruption of munitions supplies to aggressors. The domestic authorities called for the promotion of international peace through economic welfare, and the atmosphere of breaking off relations with Japan became increasingly turbulent. From January to June 1938, the US averaged more than US$1 million per month, with some months reaching as much as US$2 million. However, in July, due to the response to Hull's promotion of sanctions against Japan, munitions shipments to Japan decreased significantly. Taking military raw materials as an example, they were worth US$1,125,493 in July, but decreased to US$179,249 in August. The decrease was even greater in September and October, with September worth US$85,138 and October worth only US$78,720. After October, the military supplies shipped by the US to Japan were all goods that Japan had pre-ordered from US merchants before July. If we wait until the contract expires, the amount of military supplies imported by the US to Japan will naturally decrease.

As for the practical munitions (firearms, ammunition, and aircraft) supplied by the US to Japan, there was a significant reduction. In February 1938, the average monthly value was US$1,250,000 from July to August, but decreased to US$679,000 in September, and decreased to US$368,000 in October. The biggest reduction was in aircraft.

From the above trade figures, we can draw a conclusion that the US's non-cooperation and ban on the export of munitions to Japan have been quite effective. According to the State Department's report, from January to October, although the main transportation routes were cut off by the Japanese and transportation was difficult, the total amount of practical munitions supplied by the US to China was still worth US$7,760,360. In Japan, although it occupied the main coastal transportation routes in China and there was no obstruction to transportation between the US and Japan, the total amount was only US$9,019,458, which was only slightly different from that of China. If China continues its long-term resistance, the munitions trade between Japan and the US will inevitably plummet and become a downward trend.

### Bloodshed Occurs in Wanchai Hennessy Road Tea House Late at Night; Man Seriously Injured with Axe; Hit with Bottle Then Chopped with Knife, Life in Danger; Assailant's Nerves Stimulated by Tragic Experience

At 0:30 AM yesterday morning, a case of a middle-aged man being seriously injured in the Tea Fragrance Room at 81 Hennessy Road, Wanchai occurred. After the incident, the assailant went to the Police Station to surrender himself. The following is a record of the investigation.

Man Attacked in Tea Fragrance Room

The location where this late-night bloodshed occurred was in the Tea Fragrance Room Restaurant on the ground floor of 81 Hennessy Road, Wanchai. The restaurant has booths and loft seating. The incident occurred in the first booth on the right. Before this bloodshed took place (around 0:00 AM yesterday morning), a middle-aged man in a black suit brought a modern woman to the restaurant for a meal, sitting in the first booth on the right and ordering food. At 0:30 AM, a waiter named Li Bing (20+ years old) suddenly lost control for unknown reasons. He took off the dart he was wearing on his hand, held a soda bottle, and rushed forward, hitting the man on the head. The man was caught off guard and was hit squarely, causing the bottle to shatter and blood to flow like a fountain. He fell to the ground, and the soda bottle also shattered, injuring the assailant's hand with shards of glass.

Soda Bottle and Cleaver Used as Weapons

After the assailant stunned the man with the soda bottle, he took a cleaver and hacked at the injured man indiscriminately. He was struck twice on the head, once on the top of the head, and once on the left arm. Each wound was deep enough to see bone. After receiving these several blows, the injured man's injuries became more serious, and fresh blood flowed out of the wounds, as if he were bathing in a pool of blood. At this time, other tea drinkers in the room, seeing the bloodshed, left the store one after another. However, the assailant remained calm after the attack, his face unchanged, and he did not flee, but instead sounded the police whistle to alert the police.

Police Not Called, Surrenders Himself

Unexpectedly, after whistling for a long time, no police officers arrived. The assailant went to Police Station No. 1 to surrender himself. The on-duty officer in charge of the station, upon hearing the report, considered the case to be serious and immediately dispatched a large team of Western detectives to investigate the scene and photographed the location of the bloodshed for government records. They also found a cleaver and fragments of a soda bottle in the store, which were taken back to the police station as evidence for future trials. At the same time, they telegraphed the Fire Department to send ten vehicles to the scene to send the injured man to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. After arriving at the hospital, although the on-duty doctor tried his best to treat him, he remained unconscious. Because of excessive blood loss, it is necessary to see if the injury can pass the danger before determining whether his life is safe or not. As for the eyewitnesses at the scene, the partners of the restaurant, and the woman who came to the restaurant with the injured man, they were all summoned to the police station by detectives to inquire about the situation and file it for record.

Family Scattered, People Dead, Nerves Stimulated

It is found that the assailant's name is Li Bing, and he is only 20+ years old. He was hired as a waiter when the Tea Fragrance Room opened a few months ago. Li's family has always lived in Guangzhou. Recently, he received a letter from his family stating that the family was unfortunate and suffered misfortune due to the national crisis. His parents and brothers died tragically. Li Bing was extremely sad when he received the news, and his nerves were suddenly severely stimulated, so he had this violent outburst. As for the Tea Fragrance Room, due to the unfortunate bloodshed that occurred in the store yesterday morning, the store was unable to continue its business operations yesterday.

### Hong Kong Fishing Boat Attacked and Burned by × Again; Thoroughly Looted Then Set on Fire; More Than 20 Fishermen Adrift at Sea

Yesterday, the Fishermen's Progressive Association received a report from fishermen again that Shau Kei Wan trawler fishing boat No. 2545W, owned by Zhong Xihuan, went out to sea for fishing in mid-month. The day before yesterday (28th) at 2:00 PM, when it sailed to the sea area at the junction of Chuk Yue and Chuk Chau, it saw a × soldier speedboat approaching head-on. It was about to raise its sails to escape, but was eventually caught up and ordered to stop for inspection. Then several × soldiers jumped down the boat with guns and ordered them to raise their sails and sail to a nearby island. Then they lowered the sampans on the boat into the sea and took the 23 people, including the old, the young, women, and children, onto the sampans. They looted everything they had and gave them two sheets of cartoon pamphlets with lies. Then they poured water on the boat and set it on fire, leaving no trace. In total, they lost five to six thousand yuan. The 20+ of them gathered on the sampan, leaving it to capsize. Yesterday morning, they encountered a Cheung Chau ferry, waved and shouted for help, begging them to tow them back to Hong Kong. However, the ferry refused to accept them. After repeated pleas, they only agreed to take a fisherman named Shi Wenyou back to Hong Kong to report to the Fishermen's Association and request a ship to be sent to tow them back from the disaster site. Therefore, the remaining 22 people are still stranded overseas.

### Overseas Hong Kong Huiyang Chamber of Commerce Proceeds with Reclamation to Aid Refugees; Allocates 15,000 Yuan to Reclaim Danshui Jilong Mountain; Establishes Reclamation Committee to Be Fully Responsible for Everything

When × troops invaded Guangdong, Huiyang suffered the most damage because of its strategic location. Now that the × troops have withdrawn, the refugees after the disaster are everywhere. They have no homes to return to and no clothes or food. The disaster situation is tragic. The Overseas Hong Kong Huiyang Chamber of Commerce has been actively handling accounting and relief work in recent months. Recently, it has been proposed that it is not a long-term solution for refugees to sit and eat all day, so reclamation will be carried out in suitable locations in the mainland to implement fundamental relief measures. The budget is to allocate 15,000 yuan first, and the location will be selected as Danshui Jilong Mountain. The plan is roughly divided into the following points:

Establish a Reclamation Committee

1. Motivation: According to past aid to refugees, it is a stopgap measure. Using refugees for reclamation can make the most of their efforts and make the most of the land, which is a fundamental relief measure. 2. Establishment of the Reclamation Committee: The motivation was launched on the 16th of this month. The Reclamation Committee was established and Xu Rangcheng and others were elected as members to plan everything. On the 22nd, two staff members, Yan Kezhen and Ye Renchun, were selected to go to the Jilong Mountain area to investigate soil quality, water conservancy, and local conditions. 3. Investigation Results: The investigators returned to the meeting on the 27th and reported that the Jilong Mountain wasteland is vast and endless. You can choose a corner for reclamation at will, and you can get a thousand acres of area. All the wasteland belongs to low hills and ridges, with loose, thick, and fertile soil. The water source is quite large, and with manpower maintenance, there is no need to worry about water conservancy. The location is suitable between Danshui and Longgang, with convenient water and land transportation, and the location is close to the disaster area. If funds can be allocated for operation, it will be able to accommodate a large number of refugees. According to the investigators' report, the villagers of the villages near Jilong Mountain strongly agree with this move.

Implement Refugee Relocation

4. Implement the relocation of refugees for reclamation. At the relief meeting last night on the 28th, the results of the discussion were to first relocate the refugees from Shatoujiao and all the necessary items to Jilong Mountain to start reclamation in order to cultivate in the early spring. 5. Allocate reclamation fees. The relief meeting decided to temporarily allocate 15,000 yuan in military coupons for the Jilong Mountain reclamation fee. All detailed rules for handling shall be the responsibility of the Reclamation Committee. Detailed regulations shall be drafted by the Reclamation Committee and submitted to the General Assembly for approval and implementation. Personnel have now been sent to negotiate with the county government authorities on various procedures to be handled. Once they are properly identified, they can be opened.

### Western Policemen Request Improvement of Treatment, Proceed to Submit Petition

According to yesterday's Hong Kong English Sunday newspaper, it is reported that Hong Kong Western policemen are now proceeding to submit a petition requesting improvement of treatment and a large increase in the current salary, especially for senior police officers.

### Smuggling Rampant; Gun Battle Between Customs Police and Smugglers at Shenzhen Sino-British Border Yesterday Afternoon; Guns Fired to Arrest Smugglers Who Return Fire; One Smuggler Injured, Two Arrested

At about 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a shooting incident occurred between Shenzhen customs officers and smugglers. As a result, a man was shot in the left hand, and two other men were detained in the police station, suspected of being smugglers. It is investigated that smugglers gathered in the Shenzhen River area at the Sino-British border in Shenzhen. If customs officers are even slightly negligent, smugglers will swarm across the border. Once they cross the border, it is very difficult to investigate and arrest them. At about 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, smugglers were again smuggling goods behind the You Sheng Company building, not far from the border, and crossing the Shenzhen River from the Chinese side. Unexpectedly, they were discovered by customs anti-smuggling police, who immediately stopped them. In this critical moment, the customs anti-smuggling police fired warning shots, and the smugglers also returned fire. For a time, gunshots were heard repeatedly, frightening many male and female refugees nearby. In the end, the smugglers were defeated and all were repelled. A man was hit by a bullet in the left hand and was in so much pain that he could not walk. He was carried back to the Shenzhen Police Station by the anti-smuggling officers. Two other men were also detained, all of whom were suspected of being involved in the smuggling case.

### Three Robberies Occurred in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories Yesterday; Robbed Jewelry and Cash Amounted to Thousands of Dollars

Recently, armed robbery cases have occurred continuously on both land and water in Hong Kong. Yesterday, three robberies occurred continuously in Shangshui Village, Tseung Kwan O, and Sham Shui Po in the New Territories. The robbers were all armed with pistols and sharp swords, and they were imposing. The robbed jewelry and cash amounted to more than two thousand yuan. The victims went to the police station to report the cases and requested investigation and arrest. The cases are recorded as follows:

Shangshui Village

The woman Yao Yuchan (48 years old) and her daughter-in-law Zhou Meiying (21 years old) live together in a thatched house in Shangshui Village, New Territories, without a house number. They make a living by farming and have some savings, which has caused them to be coveted by robbers. At about 3:00 AM yesterday morning, five robbers, two holding pistols and one holding a flashlight, broke in to rob them. At that time, Yao and her daughter-in-law were dreaming and were awakened by the sound of digging. Before long, the thieves had entered. First, they pointed at Yao and threatened her, then they went to the attic and threatened her daughter-in-law. Because they resisted slightly, the woman's head was slightly injured by the thieves, and she was eventually subdued and covered with a palm quilt. Then they carried out a large-scale search and robbery for about half an hour, robbing them of HK$810, 1,600 yuan in national currency, and two gold rings, and then left calmly.

Sham Shui Po

A resident of 154 Apliu Street, Sham Shui Po, Mr. A, his concubine Hu Jin (28 years old), and a maid lived together on the second floor. At about 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Mr. A went out, leaving only his concubine and maid at home. Suddenly, five men knocked on the door, two of whom were carrying bamboo poles, claiming to have been hired to move furniture. Hu did not notice and opened the door to welcome them in. Unexpectedly, the other three were carrying sharp swords. After entering the door, they immediately drew their swords and pointed them at Hu and the maid, driving them to a corner, and then tied them up. Then they went straight into the room and dug open the silver box, taking all the jewelry and cash contained in it. After the thieves left, Hu untied the ropes and sounded the alarm, and then went to the police station to report the case. As for the amount of the loss, it could not be known in detail because her husband was out.

Tseung Kwan O

Wu Mei, Lu Qiao, and Lu Ning, warehouse clerks of the Southwest Petroleum Company in Tseung Kwan O, reported to the Shau Kei Wan Police Station yesterday that at about 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, when they were passing near Hang Hau Village, they were suddenly surrounded and intercepted by six robbers armed with sharp swords and bamboo poles. Under threat, they could not resist and were thoroughly searched, robbing them of HK$5 and leaving in separate directions. Please file the case for investigation.

### The Hainan Representative Assembly Elects its First Executive and Supervisory Committee Members; Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees to be Held Today

Following the passage of the organizational charter of the Hainan Overseas Chinese Federation at the Hainan Overseas Chinese Representative Assembly yesterday, the election of the first Executive and Supervisory Committee members was conducted. After rigorous voting over the past two days, forty-one Executive Committee members and eleven Supervisory Committee members were elected. These included eleven representatives of inner Siam (Thailand), four each from Singapore, Penang, Malacca, Selangor, Johor, and Hong Kong, and three each from the Dutch East Indies and Annam (Vietnam). There was one alternate Executive Committee member from each location and three alternate Supervisory Committee members from Siam, and one each from Singapore, Penang, Malacca, Selangor, Johor, Hong Kong, the Dutch East Indies, and Annam. After the election of the Executive and Supervisory Committee members, the Assembly was adjourned, and all matters will be handled by the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Federation. It has been decided that the first joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees will be held this afternoon.

### Opening Up New Tax Revenue Sources: Heavy Tax on Heavy Oil Vehicles; Most Heavy Oil Users are Long-Distance Vehicles

The Hong Kong government, in order to open up new sources of tax revenue, specially appointed Financial Secretary Gim Sin-ngai, Barrister Lo Man-kam, and five others to form a tax system research committee, with the Financial Secretary as the ex officio chairman. They are responsible for studying the current general economic situation in Hong Kong and recommending appropriate new taxes to increase income. After this matter was announced, many Chinese and Western individuals in Hong Kong offered suggestions. Although the research committee has held many meetings, the measures to be taken remain confidential, and the committee members are tight-lipped. According to a report in yesterday's English-language Sunday newspaper, the Hong Kong government intends to tax vehicles equipped with diesel engines. This tax will differentiate between vehicles using gasoline and heavy oil, with the latter referring to vehicles equipped with diesel engines, which are mostly long-distance vehicles. The reason for this taxation is that gasoline is already subject to a high tax rate, while heavy oil is not. Therefore, the former has already contributed significantly in taxes. Moreover, the fuel consumption of diesel engines is much lower, so taxing heavy oil users is intended to balance the tax burden between the two types of fuel.

### Population Registration in England to be Implemented Soon; Chinese Allowed to Register Freely

The Hong Kong government, in view of the need for accurate information on the quality of personnel for wartime service, in order to quickly recruit personnel in times of emergency, submitted the Personnel Ordinance to the Legislative Council for approval, in order to implement personnel registration. This registration is limited to British citizens, while Chinese and British-born Chinese can register voluntarily. According to a report in the Hong Kong English-language Sunday newspaper, the Hong Kong authorities have not yet decided on the date of implementation and are still considering the matter. One reason is the delay in printing the registration forms, and they are also considering exemption measures. However, the official announcement will be made soon. Once announced, all British citizens residing in Hong Kong between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five will be required to submit the completed forms within two months. There are no restrictions on the Chinese, who can register voluntarily.

### Tang Sai Singing Girls Awarded for Charity Performance: Singing Girls Enthusiastically Serve the Nation, Hong Kong Anticipates Victory Songs

Special Feature

In our country's sacred history of resistance against Japan, the women's sector occupies a glorious page. For example, Old Madam Zhao organized a guerrilla force, and Yang Huimin presented the flag at the Four Banks Warehouse. Many female compatriots braved countless dangers and endured immense hardships to care for wounded soldiers and comfort the fighting soldiers at the front, serving the heroes of the battlefield. In the rear, they raised comfort items, medicines, sewed military uniforms, and participated in fundraising for various types of war bonds. All of these are historical materials that should be included in future war histories and should not be omitted or avoided.

In Hong Kong, various women's organizations are still doing commendable work. Recently, the Tang Sai singing girls held their sixth charity performance to raise funds for the Chinese Youth Relief Corps, adding another praiseworthy page to the history of the war of resistance.

Yesterday—the day after the eighth anniversary of the "January 28th Incident"—in the afternoon, on the third floor of the Shek Tong Tsui Garden Restaurant, an emotional scene unfolded. This was the grand awards ceremony for the sixth charity performance.

Hanging above the stage was a portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, flanked by crossed Kuomintang and national flags. In the center was a table displaying a glittering crown, two tiaras, and several shiny silver tripods. On both sides of the stage were piles of colorful flower baskets, smiling brightly at the audience. In front hung a silk banner that read "Patriotic Songstresses," along with a small couplet that said, "The war of resistance has not yet succeeded, donations are still needed." The atmosphere all around was enthusiastic.

At 3:30 PM, amidst the melodious music, this meaningful awards ceremony began under the gaze of hundreds of eyes. Ms. Bu Dezhi, wearing the uniform of the relief corps and exuding a heroic spirit, first stood on the stage.

Chairman Chen Zhiyi briefly explained the great significance of the singing girls' charity performance and thanked the sponsors for their generosity.

Ms. Kuang reported on the preparations for the charity performance, sincerely praising the enthusiasm and efforts of several women, including the chairpersons of the charity performance troupe, Bao Yu, Mei Li Li, Wan Hong Nv, and Duo Nv. Ms. Bao Yu was the founder of the charity performance, and the others were outstanding performers who shared a common belief in the cause.

The experienced revolutionary heroine He Xiangning delivered a poignant and moving speech. She said that in the past, Chinese women had no status, and the rise and fall of the nation was considered irrelevant to them. There was also a derogatory saying about singing girls: "Singing girls do not know the sorrow of national subjugation, still singing 'Backyard Flowers' across the river." But now, things are very different. Singing girls have awakened. They not only know the sorrow of national subjugation but also participate in the work of national salvation. Therefore, these insulting verses about singing girls should be changed immediately. Let us change them to "Singing girls enthusiastically serve the nation, Hong Kong anticipates victory songs!"

Amidst the prolonged applause, Ms. He expressed her earnest expectations for the ladies and gentlemen living in comfort. At the same time, she hoped that the ladies of the charity performance would continue to promote their sincere patriotic spirit, so that it would have an even greater and better impact in the war of resistance!

Guest Tang Jiancun, in an impassioned tone, elaborated on the significance of the singing girls' charity performance. He said that since the "July 7th Incident," Chinese daughters have made glorious achievements. The Tang Sai singing girls have held six charity performances, contributing their best efforts. This spirit is as praiseworthy as the heroic women who presented the flag at the Four Banks Warehouse. In terms of social status, they may not be comparable to the wives and daughters of officials, wealthy merchants, and magnates, but in terms of national interest, they have the glory of honor and should make those who only know how to apply makeup and live a life of drunken dreams, unaware of the rise and fall of the nation, ashamed to death!

Bao Yu, the representative of the charity performance troupe, spoke elegantly and humbly. She said, "The first two of the past six charity performances had the best results; the first raised more than 5,000 yuan, and the second raised more than 4,000 yuan. The following performances saw a decline. This time, thanks to the efforts of Ms. Kuang Dezhi and the inspiration of the relief corps in the work of national salvation, we suddenly recovered to more than 3,000 yuan. However, in terms of national salvation, this is still a drop in the bucket and does not help much. I hope that wealthy ladies and gentlemen will contribute more."

Finally, Mrs. Wu Chaoshu presented the awards. Mei Li Li, Wan Hong Nv, and Duo Nv were called out to the stage in turn, first crowned, and then awarded silver tripods. Mei Li Li, the "Singing Queen," wearing a snow-white fur coat, with an oval face and neatly styled hair, graciously accepted the crown of honor. Wan Hong Nv was elegant and quiet, wearing black glasses, like a well-educated student, revealing a faint smile under the gaze of the audience after wearing the "Red Star" tiara. Duo Nv was like a girl from a modest family, but wearing a sable fur coat, she maintained the demeanor of a "Singing Leader!"

### Most of the Cotton Cloth and Foreign Goods Stored in Hong Kong have Been Sold; Exporters can Overcome Difficulties; Cotton Cloth Inventory is Now Only 500,000 to 600,000 Yuan; Foreign Goods are also Gradually Decreasing, and Western Merchants are No Longer Pressuring

Hong Kong's cotton cloth, textiles, foreign goods, copper, iron, electrical appliances and other export merchants previously ordered goods worth six or seven million yuan from Europe and the United States, intending to transport them to inland South China for sale. Unexpectedly, as soon as the goods arrived, the war in South China suddenly broke out, and transportation was interrupted. The ordered goods could not be transported for sale, and the foreign firms were pressing for payment and delivery on schedule. In order to avoid significant losses, the merchants jointly petitioned the Western Merchants Association and Chinese representatives, asking them to request the Hong Kong government to ask the Western merchants to postpone the delivery of goods. However, to this day, there has been no result. The reporter believes that the Lunar New Year is approaching, and if this issue is not resolved, the merchants will be even more affected. To understand the current situation, the reporter made a special investigation to relevant parties yesterday. According to a merchant, the largest inventory two months ago was cotton cloth, worth no less than three million yuan. Because sales to the interior have been completely cut off, they have sought to promote sales in new markets, such as Guangzhou Bay, Chi Kan, Macau, and Gulangyu. In the past one or two months, many of these goods have been sold. At the same time, due to the increase in population in Hong Kong, retail business is better, so more than 80% of the goods worth more than three million yuan have been sold. The current inventory in the warehouse is only worth five or six hundred thousand yuan. It is expected that another 10% can be sold by the end of the lunar year, and the remaining will not be a problem. It is hoped that this difficult situation can be overcome safely. As for foreign goods, the sales in Hong Kong have not been prosperous due to the massive dumping of × goods. Fortunately, the previous inventory was only one million yuan. Currently, some of it has been transported for sale to Guangzhou Bay, Gulangyu and other places. The goods stored in Hong Kong are only worth three or four hundred thousand yuan. The foreign firms are no longer urging for delivery, so it is also hoped that this situation can be overcome safely. It was also learned that cotton cloth merchants must order goods from Europe and the United States three months in advance. Currently, a small number of stores have begun to order summer goods from foreign firms, but because of the impact of the dumping of × goods, they have not dared to order too much.

### The Active Hui Bao People's Guerrilla (2)

— Rouzhi

The guerrilla force is the vanguard of the people's resistance to Japan and also the school of the people's resistance to Japan. In addition to several detachments and a special service team of soldiers, there is also a political work team, which is led and directed by the political department of the general team. The political work team pays special attention to political education and learning, but also receives military training. If necessary, it can also hold guns to fight. The political education of soldiers is the responsibility of the political department personnel. The work of the political work team focuses on propaganda and organization among the people. In the places where it is stationed, there are market reports published every market day, which are warmly welcomed by the masses. However, the work of the masses is not solely the responsibility of the political work team. The soldiers of each detachment also have not given up this responsibility. Whenever there are plays and songs, the members of the political work team participate, and the soldiers of each detachment also participate. In the past, they have performed several plays. Now they have decided to perform once every market day. Most of the scripts are written by themselves. Although the performance results may not be perfect, the effect is not small. The day the reporter went to the headquarters of the general team was the day they performed a play at the July 7th Memorial Platform in the market. Unfortunately, I arrived two hours late and could not see their performance, which I deeply regret. I heard them say that one of the plays performed that day was "Little Hero," which was written, directed, and starred in by a genuine little hero among the soldiers, and was very much admired by the people.

Because they have a deep and correct political understanding, they can consciously and actively learn knowledge and skills in all aspects of politics and military affairs. Their dinner is lively and intense. After the discussion and review, they sing songs and shout slogans, which further enhances the mood of resistance.

They are all outstanding children of the Chinese nation who are working hard to resist Japan. None of them do not know how to respect the interests of the people. Therefore, their adherence to discipline is completely conscious and not forced at all. Each detachment has a Sun Yat-sen room, and a blackboard newspaper is published every few days. They educate and encourage each other. Because there are many progressive intellectuals among the soldiers, writing and editing are not a problem. The people in the political department only provide guidance.

They also pay attention to physical exercise. Every day before dinner, someone plays basketball, and after dinner, they play various games! Most of them are interesting and meaningful. Their lives are not boring at all!

The most distinctive thing is: there are more than a dozen female soldiers among them. Some are political workers and paramedics, but there are also some soldiers who are both literate and martial. One of them bravely fought in Dongguan. A soldier I know told me that when practicing target shooting, this female soldier hit the bullseye with three consecutive shots. In the future, it will not be difficult to become the sharpshooter goddess described in the novel "The Forty-First"!

At present, the main tasks of the guerrilla force are: mobilizing the masses, eliminating traitors, preventing bandit activities, helping the government to promote wartime work, consolidating and expanding their own organization, and improving the combat effectiveness of the troops. They have a glorious and great future, which no one can deny. However, because the government's territory is broken and the income from taxes has been reduced, it cannot provide the guerrilla force with ammunition and rations. In the past, the support was entirely dependent on the seamen and overseas Chinese. Before the reporter went to the headquarters of the general team, the seamen's comfort group and the workers of the Yu Le Society had all gone to express their condolences and sent a lot of supplies. Therefore, cotton clothes and medicines are now quite sufficient. However, the future is long, and they not only need to exist, but also need to develop - even military blankets, rubber shoes, raincoats, etc. are still lacking - so assistance and support for them are still very necessary.

Now the war of resistance has turned to the first stage, and guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines will become the main mode of operation. Regarding this point, it seems that there are still many people who do not understand. Because they do not understand, the fact that is expressed is of course to ignore the guerrilla force. This is a very bad phenomenon. After reporting, the reporter dares to ask all the elders and brothers in the East River area and the overseas Chinese in various places to pay the most attention to this model of popular armed forces - the Hui Bao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla!

Transportation and Travel

### Developing Rich Resources in the Southwest and Northwest; Completing the Railway Network; Xiang-Gui Railway Open to Traffic, Cheng-Yu Railway Nearing Completion; Chuan-Dian, Dian-Mian, and Bao-Cheng Railways Actively Underway

[Chongqing Correspondent] The Chinese government believes that in order to develop the rich resources of the southwest and northwest, it is necessary to complete transportation infrastructure, especially railways, as railways are essential for large-scale freight transport. The Ministry of Transportation has decided to make every effort to complete railway construction, while also building highways to assist railways. The details are as follows:

Existing Railways in the Northwest and Southwest

China's western region includes the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang in the northwest, and the five provinces of Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi in the southwest. The total land area of these ten provinces is 4.92 million square kilometers, with a total population of approximately 100 million. In terms of railways, there are currently three lines. In addition to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which was established earlier, the completion of the other two lines has also occurred in recent years. The Tongguan-Xi'an section and the Xi'an-Baoji section of the Longhai Railway, and the Ge-Bi-Shi Railway were completed in 1936. The total length of the three lines is only about 100 kilometers. In addition, there is the North Sichuan Railway, which is only 22 kilometers long.

Cheng-Yu Railway Completed and Open to Traffic

The Cheng-Yu Railway was originally the western section of the Chuan-Han Railway. After the failure of the Chuan-Han Railway, it was shelved for as long as twenty years. In March 1936, the Ministry of Railways, in accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, first prepared to build the Cheng-Yu Railway, dividing it into eight survey teams. From Chengdu to Chongqing, the entire area is rich in Sichuan's products, with a total length of 503 kilometers. The cost is 50 million yuan. In addition to forming the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company to raise a capital of 30 million yuan, a loan of 24.5 million yuan was borrowed from a French banking group. Construction started in February of the previous year. After the outbreak of the war, it was ordered to be completed ahead of schedule, and it can be opened to traffic this spring.

Planning to Build Chuan-Dian and Dian-Mian Railways

The new railways currently being actively planned are the Chuan-Dian and Dian-Mian main lines. The former runs from Xufu, Sichuan to Kunming, Yunnan, and the latter runs from Kunming to Myanmar. They are the main transportation lines connecting the Yangtze River with India and Burma. The two lines have a total length of 1,500 kilometers and are contracted by the Chuan-Dian Railway Company. The company has a capital of 20 million yuan. Shen Changren is the director of the Chuan-Dian Railway Engineering Bureau, and Fu Fujun is the director of the Dian-Mian Railway Engineering Bureau. Construction of the Chuan-Dian Railway has begun and is scheduled to be completed in two years. The funding for the Dian-Mian Railway is included in the credit loan for the construction of the Guang-Mei Railway in Guangdong.

Xiang-Gui Railway to be Built in Four Sections

The Xiang-Gui Railway runs from Hengyang Station on the Yue-Han Railway to Guilin, Liuzhou, Yongning, and Longzhou, to Zhennanguan on the Guangxi-Vietnam border, where it connects with a branch line of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The total length of the railway is 950 kilometers and is built in four sections: Hengyang to Guilin is the first section, Guilin to Liuzhou is the second section, Liuzhou to Yongning is the third section, and Yongning to Zhennanguan is the fourth section. The Hengyang to Guilin section is 300 kilometers long and costs 36 million yuan. After one and a half years of work, it was opened to traffic on October 1 last year. The roadbed for the remaining three sections has been completed, and it is scheduled to be opened to traffic for the entire line this winter.

Completing the Bao-Lan and Bao-Cheng Lines

After the Longhai Railway reaches Baoji, there are two options: to go west to Lanzhou or south to Chengdu. The Bao-Cheng line has greater economic value and is the main link between the southwest and northwest railway systems. Therefore, it was decided to build it first. The railway is 500 kilometers long and costs 50 million yuan, which has been raised from a Belgian banking company. Since survey teams were dispatched in the autumn of 1936, construction will soon begin. As for the Bao-Lan line, it was decided to start construction after the Bao-Cheng line is completed.

Xiang-Qian Railway, the Zhu-Xiang Section

After the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company planned to change to the China Railway Company, it wanted to contract the southwest railway from Changsha through Guiyang to Chongqing to the company. Although this has not been realized, the Xiang-Qian Railway Engineering Bureau was established in June 1936, and it was decided to build the Zhuzhou to Xiangxiang section first. The total length of the railway is about 1,000 kilometers, and the cost of construction and equipment is 160 million yuan. Since construction began, it is not known what progress has been made. It is said that the construction of the railway has been temporarily suspended due to the war.

Planning to Complete the Southwest Railway Network

The above seven lines have a total length of approximately 5,000 kilometers and require at least 500 million yuan. The Ministry of Transportation has decided to make every effort to first complete the five main lines of Bao-Cheng, Cheng-Yu, Chuan-Dian, Dian-Mian, and Xiang-Gui. These five main lines are 3,500 kilometers long. After their completion, the northwest and southwest can be connected into one, and there will be three international channels: one from Kunming to Yangon, one from Kunming to Haiphong, and one from Liuzhou to Haiphong. In addition, it is planned to take Guiyang as the center, build the Chuan-Qian Railway to the north to connect Chongqing with Cheng-Yu, build the Dian-Qian Railway to the west to connect Qujing with Chuan-Dian, build the Xiang-Qian Railway to the east to connect Zhuzhou with Yue-Han, and build the Gui-Qian Railway to the south to connect Liuzhou with Xiang-Gui.

Then Build Northwest Railways

Next, take Lanzhou as the center, and build the Bao-Lan section of the Longhai Railway in turn, connecting Baoji with Bao-Cheng, the Bao-Lan Railway from Lanzhou to Ningxia and then to Baotou, connecting with the Ping-Sui Railway, the Gan-Xin Railway from Lanzhou through Hami and Dihua to Tacheng, connecting with the Soviet railway, the Gan-Qing Railway from Lanzhou to Xining, and the Chuan-Gan Railway from Dashui on the Longhai Railway to Chengdu, connecting with the Bao-Cheng and Cheng-Yu railways, and extending to Kangding, thus completing the northwest railway system. The above plans will be gradually implemented step by step.

### Journey to the Northwest, Continued

— Mai Qunyu

The Five Springs at the foot of Gaolan Mountain south of the city are a famous scenic and historical site in Lanzhou. Legend has it that the Han dynasty general Huo Qubing resisted the Xiongnu here. Because there was no water to drink, he struck the stone with a whip and obtained a spring. The spring names are divided into Juyue Spring, Momeng Spring, Biangan Spring, Ganlu Spring, and Huan Spring. The spring water gushes out from the stone and does not dry up all year round. There are shady trees and several tea rooms, which is a unique place to escape the summer heat. There are many temples next to the spring. During the Buddha's birthday, the Lanzhou market is moved here, and the quiet place becomes a lively place.

In terms of industry, there are two match factories, Guangming and Tongsheng, and the Huasui Tobacco Company. I have visited them. The scale of each factory is very small and the equipment is very good. The most interesting thing is the Huasui Tobacco Company. According to Mr. Zhang Xuwu, the chairman of the company, when he started the company, a certain foreign tobacco company offered him a gift of 300,000 yuan, advising him not to start the company, but he refused. After more than a year of operation, a certain cigarette company that monopolized the northwest was severely hit, and the recovery of rights was not uncommon.

The people are simple, hardworking, and more trustworthy than those in Guanzhong. Most of the women have bound feet, and the smell of opium fills the entire Lanzhou city. The provincial government has repeatedly issued orders to ban smoking, but those who ban it ban it themselves, and those who smoke it smoke it themselves. I have visited friends in the business world, and they all entertain guests with opium.

After living in Lanzhou for a long time, I am eager to travel to Qinghai. After hiring mules and horses, I decided to set off tomorrow. In the evening, a police officer came and said: "There is a group of bandits in Bapan Mountain, dozens of miles west of Lanzhou, so be sure not to set off to prevent accidents." After hearing this, I was half-doubtful, so I went to the Tibetan friends and muleteers who came from Xining. They all said that this was not the case. At the same time, I also felt strange, how did they know that I was going? If there is smoke, there must be fire. There must be a reason.

### From Guilin to Yunnan —Via Longzhou and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway—

Day One

Traveling from Guilin to Liuzhou by water is not direct; one must take a car along the Lihua Highway to reach Liuzhou by land, a total of 241 kilometers, taking about eight to ten hours. The fare is 11.3 yuan in national currency per person. In Liuzhou, there are six or seven hotels such as Xinliujiang Hotel, Peixin Inn, Central Hotel, and Datong Township Inn. Daily room rates range from 6 jiao to 4 yuan, and meal expenses range from 5 jiao to 6 jiao per meal. Staying in a hotel near the station is more convenient.

Day Two

Traveling from Liuzhou to Nanning, take the Yongbinqianliu Highway to Nanning, a total of 675 Chinese miles (258 kilometers), taking eight or nine hours. The fare is 11.2 yuan in national currency per person. Most meals are taken in Luxu or Datang. It is more convenient to purchase tickets in advance through the China Travel Service. However, please note that passengers must take care of their own luggage when loading and unloading at stations in Liuzhou and Nanning. The same applies to luggage that needs to be weighed and charged extra. Passengers who disembark midway to join the army must pay attention to their luggage to avoid mistakes. Hotels in Nanning include Lequn Society, Guanghua Hotel, Nanning Hotel, Zhongshan Hotel, Xijiang Inn, Yongnan Inn, Yongjiang Inn, Huilai Inn, Hua’an Hostel, and Anzhan, with prices ranging from 3 jiao to 4 yuan.

Day Three

From Nanning to Longzhou, take the long-distance bus of the Head Office of Roads (because only publicly operated commercial vehicles are currently running on this route), traveling along the Yonglong Highway, passing through places such as Wuxu, Suxu, Ruicai, Mingjiang, Ningming, and Nakan to reach Longzhou. The journey is 640 Chinese miles (249 kilometers), taking about seven or eight hours. The fare is 1.3 yuan in national currency per person. However, there are very few restaurants along the way, and those available are not very palatable. It is best to bring your own food for cleanliness. In Longzhou, there are only a few hotels, namely Zhennan, Huanan, Xinhua, and Hongan, among which Zhennan Hotel is better equipped. The hotel is located on Limin Street, with a two-story building built in a semi-Western style, which is quite elegant. The room rate is from 6 jiao to 8 jiao per person per day, and several accounts of bedding are provided without additional charges. The transcription fee ranges from 3 jiao to 5 jiao, and the dishes are ordinary. To go from Longzhou to Yunnan via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and obtain a passport, upon arrival in Longzhou, immediately go to a photo studio to take four two-inch passport photos (Guilin currency 1.5 yuan), which can be prepared on the same day. Take them to the Guangxi All-Border Anti-Smuggling Supervisory Office. Go to the gatehouse to get a resume form, fill it out, and submit it to the officer in charge of this matter in the office (office hours are from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM). Also pay a handling fee of 2 yuan in national currency. The passport can be collected in two or three days. After collecting it, take it to the French Consulate for signature between 2:00 PM and 3:00 PM, and pay a signature fee of 1 Vietnamese yuan at the same time. It can be collected around 8:00 PM that evening. After the passport is processed, consider exchanging some Vietnamese currency, preferably around 20 yuan. Take a highway military vehicle to Dong Dang (fare of 5.32 yuan in Vietnamese currency), departing at 6:00 or 7:00 AM and arriving before noon. On the same day, take the train to Hanoi, with a third-class fare of 2.7 Vietnamese yuan. Excess baggage is 1.96 yuan per 100 kilograms. In Hanoi, there are hotels near the railway station, such as Tongli and Tianran, with double rooms costing 3 Vietnamese yuan and single rooms costing 1.5 Vietnamese yuan.

From Hanoi to Kunming

Day One: Depart from Hanoi at 9:20 AM and arrive in Lao Cai at 7:11 PM. Stay at the Daran Hotel, with a room rate of 3 Vietnamese yuan per person, calculated at 80%, including breakfast and dinner.

Day Two: Walk across the bridge to Hekou. The train departs from Hekou at 7:30 AM and arrives in Kaiyuan (i.e., Mizhou) at 6:10 PM. Stay at Shao'an or Datong Inn, with a room rate of 7 Yunnan currency.

Day Three: Depart from Kaiyuan at 6:40 AM and arrive in Kunming at 5:00 PM.

One must pay attention that there should be no prohibited or taxable items in the luggage to avoid trouble.

### Guangxi Province Highways (6)

—Pan Taifeng

And the Scenery Along the Line

Zhennanguan is the key to the southern border, leaning against the mountain and facing the sun. The Zuofen Mountain and Youfu Mountain flank it on the left and right, forming a naturally advantageous terrain. Historically, it has been said that "one man can hold the pass, and ten thousand men cannot pass." Now, an Anti-Smuggling Supervisory Office is established here for defense. Beyond the gate, which has two doors, lies the territory of French Annam. There is a highway to Dong Dang, and a national railway can reach Hanoi and Haiphong. During the Sino-French War in the late Qing Dynasty, this pass was captured by the French army. Later, famous generals such as Su Yuanchun and Feng Zicai bravely counterattacked and defeated the French army here, preserving half of the southwest. Mr. Sun Yat-sen also raised the banner of righteousness here at the end of the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, in national history, this pass has a glorious significance. Today, on the summits of Zuofu and Youfu Mountains, there are still stone-built artillery fortresses, all of which were built by Su during the border defense. When foreign powers invade and strong enemies oppress us, contemplating this place and remembering the sages, we feel the gravity of our responsibilities.

Six, Longshui Line: Starting from Longzhou and heading west, passing through Tangjiao and Luowei to Shuikouguan, the total distance is 33 kilometers. The road surface is also sandy and muddy. There are only three bridges and 150 culverts, all of which are permanent structures. The maximum gradient is 8%, and the minimum radius of the curve is 40 meters. A border inspection office is located at the point where the Long River enters Vietnam, forming a strategic alignment with Zhennanguan in national defense. If Shuikou is not defended, one can directly descend to Longzhou, threatening the back of Nanning. Therefore, in times of war, the importance of this pass is no less than that of Nanguan.

One, Wusi Line: Starting from Wuxu, 28 kilometers from Yongning (one of the stations on the Yonglong Highway), to Dasi on the border of Yaogui, the total length is 60 kilometers, passing through Mingyang, Tangbao, Nachen, Datang, Nanxiao, and Taima stations. There are twelve bridges, only one of which is temporary, and 225 culverts, all of which are permanent. The maximum gradient is 12%, and the minimum radius of the curve is 15 meters.

This line is a section of the provincial highway. Crossing the provincial border, one can reach Beihai via Qinzhou. The sea routes of Guangxi Province are this line and the Yushi Line. However, Guangzhou Bay is leased to France, and the management rights do not belong to us. Seeking to be able to freely start operations and serve as the sea gateway to the southwest, this is the only remaining option. Unfortunately, the pier facilities are inadequate and cannot fully perform the duties of handling cargo. Now that the crisis is imminent, the future of this line is also becoming increasingly dim.

Four, Appendix—Brief Description of County Roads

The above describes only the provincial roads. In addition, the county roads that have been opened to traffic have also reached more than 500 kilometers. For readers to gain a complete picture, an appendix is provided below.

Yigui County Road—From Yining City to Guicheng, 24 kilometers long.

### Planning for Improvement of Tea Production and Sales This Spring (Continued)

—Xie Yuan

The tea price in tea producing areas has plummeted, which has affected the livelihood of tea farmers. Later, merchants repeatedly petitioned the Trade Association for negotiation and consultation. It was stipulated that tea leaves should be divided into two types, A and B. Type A is tea that meets the requirements for sale to the Soviet Union, which must be purchased under the control of the Trade Association. Type B is tea that does not meet the requirements for sale to the Soviet Union, and merchants may ship it to Shanghai for sale on their own after settling foreign exchange. However, the negotiations were repeatedly delayed and unresolved, resulting in a standstill in tea sales for as long as a month. The capital turnover of merchants was thus stagnated, and the losses were incalculable. Although the direct losses were substantial, the reduction in production also affected the national revenue. Fortunately, the leaders of the Trade Association, Mr. Zou Bingwen and Mr. Wu Juenong, are both renowned agricultural scientists who are familiar with the market situation and see the drawbacks. With the mediation and assistance of the Zhejiang Provincial Tea Sales Office, merchants were persuaded to sign contracts to cooperate in the purchase, which was stored in Ningbo and Wenzhou. Tea leaves were then shipped to Hong Kong in large quantities, and the Fuhua Trading Company, a tea purchase agency under the Trade Association, purchased them, so that tea production could continue. However, the Trade Association's policy on purchasing tea leaves seems to be divergent. For example, tea leaves have been transported to Hong Kong with the assistance of the Zhejiang Provincial Tea Sales Office and sold at a loss, but the Ningbo Branch of the Trade Association still directly negotiates prices with tea merchants for purchase. The prices are different, and the methods are inconsistent, leaving merchants at a loss. This is something that the Trade Association should urgently correct. Although boxed tea has been shipped to Hong Kong, raw tea has been separately evaluated. Domestic sales of tea are exempt from foreign exchange settlement, and overseas sales of tea are settled after foreign exchange settlement and designated for loading and export. However, there is still a large accumulation of raw tea in Ningbo. Raw tea is a semi-finished product, and there is a risk of mold and rot. It urgently needs to be cleared. This is also something that the Trade Association must pay attention to. Furthermore, the Trade Association's controlled tea sales and unified tea purchase are only passive controls. Positive measures such as increasing production, improving manufacturing, and expanding sales channels all need to be gradually implemented.

Four

Last year's tea market has passed, but reviewing the past is enough to serve as a reference for the future. The Trade Association's controlled tea sales has already started. If it can properly formulate plans for increasing production, improving tea, and promoting sales channels, and implement them step by step, the revival of national tea exports can be expected. I sincerely hope for this. In the blink of an eye, spring is coming, and this year's tea market is about to begin. I believe that the Trade Association must formulate an overall policy for how to improve control and develop the tea industry at this time. I dare to offer my humble opinions for correction by the gentlemen of the Trade Association.

Establish a Council Committee: The most serious dispute between tea merchants and the Trade Association was the pricing of purchases. The Trade Association stipulated that the purchase price should be based on the cost of tea merchants and eliminate all the malpractices and handling fees of foreign merchants, foreign firms, and Shanghai foreign tea warehouses. On a practical level, this is good, but the raw materials of tea leaves vary in quality, and the manufacturing varies in fineness. On the surface, it may seem to be the same type of tea, but the cost differs greatly. If the Trade Association stipulates the purchase price, regardless of the differences, merchants will seek profit and take advantage, which will not benefit the tea industry. This is one. Also, if the purchase price of the Trade Association is too low, the malpractices of foreign merchants and foreign firms suppressing prices will inevitably be repeated. This is two. Many of the Trade Association's evaluators lack experience and are not familiar with market conditions, so omissions are inevitable. In order to eliminate the gap between the Trade Association and tea merchants and to smoothly implement improved control, it seems that representatives of tea merchants should be invited to jointly participate in the organization of a Council Committee. The Trade Association also had a proposal for an evaluation committee, but its scope of authority was too narrow to serve as a suggestion and guidance mechanism for the implementation of tea industry control. If the Trade Association's measures are inappropriate, merchants have no way to intervene, which is a problem for merchants. Gathering wisdom and benefiting from each other can lead to a detailed and appropriate plan in advance, and then rely on public judgment in implementation to avoid leaving a bad impression. Merchants will inevitably love the Trade Association and have no complaints. A research department should also be established under the Council Committee to investigate tea production, manufacturing methods, and international market conditions, so that it is in line with the facts and serves as the guide for control, earnestly guiding tea merchants on what to improve, and combining persuasion with rewards and punishments. The management of the tea industry can then be expected to improve.

Managing Tea Factories: The Trade Association's purchase price is currently based on production costs, but how to determine the cost accurately is also a problem that can be studied. Tea merchants have always relied on experience to make general estimates of cost, without accurate accounting records to rely on. It goes without saying that it cannot be used as a reliable standard. Furthermore, merchants do not pay much attention to business management, especially in tea factories located in remote mountainous areas. If the organization is not strict and corruption is difficult to prevent, this will also affect the calculation of costs. Therefore, after the Trade Association controls tea sales, it should implement management in tea factories, strictly define cost calculation methods, eliminate unnecessary waste, and promote the development of tea factory operations and consolidate its foundation. This is also a fact that cannot be ignored. Tea factory operators often change every year, and most organizations are temporary. This can reduce the sense of responsibility of those who perform the business, and it is easy to start taking advantage. There are even a few tea factories where partners do not enter into partnership agreements. After the partners contribute capital, their obligations end, and everything is the responsibility of the business operator. Although they are called partners, they are equal to sole proprietorships. Whether the capital has been paid in full is not easy for outsiders to know. If the internal situation is empty, then if it encounters a setback, it will immediately go bankrupt, defaulting on tea payments and harming tea farmers. This has happened repeatedly. The financing of tea factories is often in short supply, and the only thing that can be used for turnover is the payment from Shanghai foreign tea warehouses. After the Trade Association controls tea sales, Shanghai foreign tea warehouses can no longer act as distributors. This loan will inevitably stop being granted, and then the tea factories will have no way to obtain financing (To be continued).

### Exhausted from Extensive Travel, South China's Tired Troops Suffer Defeat, Lose 1-2 to Eastern, Jeopardizing Championship Position

(Special Report) South China, during its tour, averaged one game every two days. All players were either injured or fatigued. Upon their return, they had not recovered and had to attend the league matches. No wonder everyone's spirit was low and they were tired of playing. After all, a body of flesh and blood cannot sustain such intense exercise for long.

Yesterday, South China, with its exhausted troops, faced Eastern in Happy Valley. Their key defender, Li Tiansheng, was absent due to an unhealed foot injury. Mai Shaohan and Liu Qingcai were forced to play, which greatly reduced their defensive strength. Furthermore, Guo Yingqi, in the front line, has gained weight recently, and his performance is no longer as lively as before. (During the tour, Yingqi only participated in one battle, but he withdrew before halftime due to poor performance.) He missed several opportunities, and the South China fans were disheartened. Luo Douwen was also uninspired, causing delays. Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, and Deng Guangsen were still acceptable, but the connection of the entire front line was inconsistent and very scattered. The offensive was also weak, and balls that should have been intercepted were often wasted. It is no wonder that they were not enough to win.

Eastern, having waited in comfort, was able to win, but it was accidental, not the result of true technical achievement. In fact, South China often occupied a superior position throughout the game, but it did not turn defeat into victory, purely because the front line missed good opportunities. However, Eastern's defense was very strong and commendable.

In my opinion, South China's failure was due to the improper arrangement of the initial lineup. If Liang Rongzhao had been used as the center midfielder from the beginning to strengthen the midfield, the two goals in the first half might not have been lost.

Eastern has been promoted for three seasons, and in the past three seasons, it has been defeated by South China in every game. Only yesterday did it have the opportunity to take advantage of it, win in one fell swoop, and wipe out its past shame. It should be very happy, but thinking from the perspective of the championship, Eastern's victory is only a momentary pleasure. If the Navy can achieve great success in the future, it will be thanks to Eastern.

According to the tally, South China has played thirteen times, winning ten and losing three, with a total of twenty points. The Navy has played fourteen games, winning ten, drawing three, and losing one, with a total of twenty-three points. Compared to South China, it is one point ahead. From now on, South China must win every game to have a chance, otherwise the championship will not be theirs.

Some people were dismayed by South China's defeat yesterday, but I think South China's small defeat is fortunate. If South China had met a team other than Eastern in this game, I am afraid that the exhausted South China would have suffered a major defeat.

In short, Eastern's victory was a victory of opportunity, not a victory of technique. Their forwards' performance was very mediocre. Apart from Hou Chengtuo, there was nothing worth mentioning. The fact that they could not score more against this tired and disorganized South China defense is enough to show that their attacking power is not strong.

(Eastern Team)

Liu Xianhan, Miao Huaguo, Zeng Zhongyun, Luo Weiquan, Song Lingsheng, Liu Shidu, Hou Chengtuo, Xu Jingcheng, Li Deqi, Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingtou

(South China South)

Bao Jiaping, Liang Rongzhao, Mai Shaohan, Li Guocheng, Liu Gengcai, Zheng Suxiang, Luo Douwen, Guo Yingqi, Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, Deng Guangsen

The silver whistle blew, and the war began. The Eastern generals, eager to avenge their shame, charged into South China's gate like wolves and tigers. Four minutes later, Hou Chengtuo received the ball and nodded his head, and it went into the net. Eastern fans in the distance applauded, jumped, threw their clothes and hats, and were overjoyed. Only five minutes had passed since the start of the game.

Ten minutes later, Hou Chengtuo attacked, and South China lost another city. The South China fans were very dismayed. However, Li Zhaorong intercepted the ball and scored in one fell swoop. "Uncle Mu" was extremely happy and shouted Li Zhaorong, followed by applause.

Eastern took the lead, and the military's morale was greatly strengthened. Xu Jingcheng sold a flaw and took advantage of the situation. A certain fan shouted "four haos," but unfortunately the ball was shot too high, otherwise Xu would have had another income.

During the break, Feng Jingxiang sat on the lawn, talking about the battle situation. A child stepped forward and called "Second Uncle" and asked, "Why are you not doing well?" Second Uncle only smiled and did not answer.

Bao Jiaping said to others, "The two goals conceded were due to the negligence of the inner guards, not my fault."

Li Huitang reviewed the battle situation and also said, "The standing position of the inner guards was inappropriate." In the second half, Li Guowei retreated to the defense, and Liang Rongzhao was in the middle. After this improvement in the formation, they attacked repeatedly and attacked the gate again and again. However, Liu Xianghan performed well and averted danger.

Li Zhaorong dribbled the ball straight up, fierce and unusual. Liu Shizuan blocked him with one foot, and Li fell forward.

Eastern counterattacked, Hou Chengtuo led the ball forward, and Mai Shaohan blocked the way. The two competed in wisdom. Lao Mai was injured and fell to the ground in the rescue. Lao Hou intercepted the ball again and shot, crossing the net and missing the opportunity. Lao Hou was devastated.

The cowboy "Zeng Zhongyun" guarded the camp and was very talented. Luo Douwen wanted to break through the pass, and the two entangled and rolled into a ball, causing the fans to laugh.

In the last ten minutes, the South China generals attacked vigorously, and the front of the Eastern gate was extremely dangerous. In the chaos, Zeng Zhongyun cleared the ball with one foot, and Li Deqi received the ball and kicked it. Fortunately, he was not an inner guard but a forward.

Although South China surrounded and attacked, they did not achieve anything. Li Zhaorong and Guo Yingqi switched positions, but there was no gap to take advantage of. In the end, they lost 1-2. The Eastern generals were overjoyed, but Uncle Lu supported his crutches, drooping his head and looking unhappy. He also mentioned to others that the fall of Guangzhou was due to traitors.

### A Melee, Police Team Outplays Scottish Army, Brutal and Uninspired Performance

[Special Report] On the Boundary Street pitch, the Royal Scots and the Police played again. The first meeting ended 3-2 to the Scots. Yesterday's second match saw the Scots, weakened by an injury to Duncan, fall 2-1.

The match was uninspired. The Police were brutal, playing a tough, unpolished game. The Scots were not outdone, retaliating in kind, leading to a full-blown melee.

In the first half, the Scots, led by Law Sheung, took the initiative early on. Heuk Hickson scored to put the Scots up 1-0. In the second half, the Police grew increasingly aggressive. Duncan was injured and had to leave the pitch. Hou Lut and Wong Kwai took the opportunity to score two goals in a row, taking the lead. In terms of performance, the Scots were the stronger team. Had Duncan not been injured, the win would have been assured. Unfortunately they lost, but it wasn't for lack of effort. Here's a recap.

The First Scots took on the Police Second team, winning 7-1. Next the top teams took the field. Kerrick was out, and Johnston led the attack again. Keeler Chen lined up to defend, intercepting the ball and passing it to the front.

Manuell intercepted and passed to the center. Hickson kept pace, bypassing Kwong Yu and kicking the ball past the stunned Parrick. The Scots' quick goal came just three minutes into the match. The Police, taken by surprise, mounted a counterattack, but the forwards were scattered and missed several opportunities. Hou Lut tried a long shot, but Toong Wing saved it.

Soon, the Scots attacked again. Hickson hit the crossbar, which was saved by Norsk. Macdonald broke forward, leading to a misunderstanding with a teammate. The referee intervened, and the situation calmed down. At halftime, the Scots were up 1-0.

In the second half, the Police played with greater determination and aggression, putting the Scots under siege. Soon, Billiton passed the ball to the front, where a surge of Police players converged. Hou Lut surged forward, heading the ball into the net as Toong Wing was injured and had to leave the pitch. He was replaced in goal by Mathieson, weakening the defense. The Police grew even more aggressive, playing a tough, unpolished game and retaliating in kind, leading to a bloody melee. In the chaos, Wong Kwai snuck in a shot that Mathieson failed to save, resulting in a 2-1 loss.

(Firm Foundation)

Police Team

Parrick, Chen Kwong Yu, Parker, Norsk, Billiton, Fan Kwai Choi, Kong Hing, Hou Lut, Johnston, Wong Man Kwai, Gordon

Scots Team

Duncan, Fraser, Adamson, Keeler, Mathieson, Macdonald, Wise, Yairn, Hickson, Fleming, Manuell

### Chinese Swimming Club Annual Meeting Held Yesterday at the Winsor Hotel

### Basketball Association Meeting Tonight

Since the Basketball Association held its annual meeting on the 26th, regarding the revision of the articles of association, due to the rushed nature, the revisions may not be perfect. Therefore, many advocate postponing the revisions. The association has decided to hold a representatives meeting at 7 p.m. tonight at the Xingdao Daily Business Department to discuss any outstanding issues that have not been voted on.

### The Most Suitable Sport for Women

— Wang Xuezheng

We cannot definitively say which sport is the most suitable for women, because we have not conducted precise statistics on the effects of various sports and games on women after a long period of experimentation. From these statistics, we can obtain a clear analysis of the impact of various physical activities. However, various physical activities not only have a great impact on young women but also on their future, such as when they become mothers, and on their children. Therefore, this statistical work is very difficult to complete.

Overdeveloped and hardened muscle systems are not very suitable for women. The most important aspects of their bodies are softness, smooth curves, and contours. The reason why their bodies need these elements is not entirely for "beauty." In fact, women's bodies are made differently from men's. If they engage in appropriate exercise, their muscles will never develop as much as men's. Although women also have great physical strength, what is suitable for women is a physique that is "strong but not obvious." "Strength" naturally includes great physical power.

In today's civilized life, we must engage in systematic and regular exercise every day to obtain true health. Although women's exercise should not be too strenuous, and the duration should not be too long, the most suitable exercise for women should also be moderately strenuous. The most suitable exercise for women is harmonious and gentle gymnastics. In these exercises, it is best to include one or two rapid and relatively strenuous movements, or those exercises that require effort to hold a posture for several seconds.

Exercises that can correct body posture, or gradually eliminate excess fatty tissue in the body, as well as various corrective movements, are all very suitable for women. However, once these exercises have achieved their purpose, they should be discontinued and not continued.

Exercises with the following characteristics are very unsuitable for women: (1) Heavy blows, impacts, falls, and significant shocks to the body upon landing due to violent jumps. (2) Physical proximity between participants during exercise. (3) Activities that require great endurance or have a significant impact on the heart, lungs, and other major organs. (4) Activities that require full exertion.

Therefore, soccer, boxing, wrestling, weightlifting, long-distance or cross-country running, rowing, and other sports are not suitable for women. (To be continued)

### Alice Marble's Tennis Secrets (6) Court Partnerships

There is actually a certain easy method for serving. Before serving, you should first walk about ten feet behind the court, and then walk back to the place where you should stand to serve. When you reach the baseline point where you should stand, you should prepare to serve. The toes of your left foot should point towards the point where you think the serve should reach, and your right foot should stand slightly horizontally behind your left foot. It is best to be a little further apart, but the principle is to be natural. The ribs and shoulders should be at a 45-degree angle. This is the method for serving on the right side. If you are serving on the left side, the toes should naturally also point towards the point the ball should reach, but the ribs and shoulders should be at a 90-degree angle.

If you want to correct the most common mistakes in serving, the most important thing is to toss the ball to a height that gives you enough time to prepare a good swing, so that you have time to fully swing the racket behind you. Pay more attention to the possibility that the ball will clear the net and reach the end of the service box. Secondly, when tossing the ball, it should be slightly to the right of your body and in front of you. Do not toss the ball behind your head (but it is different when hitting an outside spin). As for tossing the ball, there is also a certain foolproof method. If you feel that your body is forced to lean backwards when hitting, you should know that the ball has been tossed too far back. If your body suddenly leans to the left when hitting, you should understand that the ball has been tossed too far to the left. If you feel that your top and skirt are pulled by a hit, this proves that the ball you tossed is high enough.

The flat aerial volley method has gradually been adopted by most female tennis players. Our recent three male champions—Vines, Pancho Gonzales, and Budge—have all adopted this method, and I also consider this method to be more reliable, crisper, more powerful, and more accurate than the chop volley method. I have two contributions to this method: the wrist must be firmly locked when hitting. If using a forehand volley, it is best to hit the ball in front of your left foot; if using a backhand volley, you should wait for the ball to reach in front of your right foot before hitting it. When hitting, your body should be tilted towards the net. The flat aerial volley does not require preparation for hitting from behind; in reality, just push forward is sufficient. The momentum should be the same as the follow-through of forehand and backhand strokes. As for volleying low balls, the method of hitting the ball with the racket face should be no different from volleying balls at waist or shoulder height, except that when hitting groundstrokes, the racket should have a follow-through towards the top of the net to ensure the ball clears the net. If you want to hit a dead ball or a ball that flies at an angle when volleying, you must naturally use the chop method, but in my opinion, the flat volley is still more suitable when going to the net.

### Movies and Theater

Entertainment… Love Finds Andy Hardy

Love Finds Andy Hardy

Every movie about the Hardy family can give the audience fresh interest. These types of movies are full of truth and can reasonably express a large number of interesting life experiences. The realism of the depiction almost allows the audience to personally experience everything in the movie and be moved by the family's joys and sorrows. The current movie, "Love Finds Andy Hardy," the fourth Hardy family movie, has a very profound and realistic depiction of the psychology of young men and women in love. Andy (played by Mickey Rooney) is very busy with love, navigating between three women, one whom he truly loves, one whom a friend entrusted him to take care of, and another who is a sincere and enthusiastic friend who gives him a lot of help. At the same time, the family encounters an unfortunate event. Andy's grandmother is seriously ill and her life is uncertain. His mother leaves home to take care of her. Under these circumstances, they prepare to spend a gloomy Christmas. But suddenly, the mother returns with good news, giving them a "consoling" gift, and the family spends a jubilant Christmas.

Mickey Rooney is particularly energetic in this movie and has achieved better results than in previous movies. Lewis Stone plays a thoughtful and sincere elder and is the most outstanding character in this movie. In addition to the original cast, a singing child star, Judy Garland, has been added. Her sincere and moving expressions and clear and melodious singing also occupy an important place in this movie.

Empress… Paris Honeymoon

Paris Honeymoon

The story is very simple, and all the scenes rely on the support of the actors. The performance is still light and pleasant. The cast is quite complete, but unfortunately, the arrangement of actors is not very suitable. Some of the actors failed to fully display their talents.

The story tells the story of a millionaire from the American West who brings his fiancée to Paris because the fiancée still has to go through divorce procedures with her ex-husband there. He first stays in a small village in the Rose Country, where he meets the local Rose Queen, who is always giving him trouble. He falls in love with the little girl he calls "Little Headache" unintentionally. At the same time, his fiancée in Paris rekindles her old love with her ex-husband. He then marries the Rose Queen.

The movie has several beautiful songs, sung by Bing Crosby. Shirley Ross and Edward Everett Horton don't have much to do in the movie. Akim Tamiroff, a star known for playing villains, plays a comedian here, and the results are not bad. Franciska Gaal's performance is lively and excellent.

Oriental… Swiss Miss

Swiss Miss

The story is very simple and tells the story of two merchants (Laurel and Hardy) who sell mousetraps. They suddenly have the whimsical idea of going to Switzerland to do business. However, not only do they not do any business, but they end up being punished by working as waiters at a hotel. The two self-righteous fools make a lot of jokes.

There are two European singers in this movie, especially the female one, who has a very good voice. Laurel and Hardy's performance is no different from their previous works.

Dahua… Everybody Sing

Everybody Sing

Starring Judy Garland. Although her voice is not as moving as Deanna Durbin's, she is also an outstanding talent among the new stars. The content of the movie is about a family of theater maniacs. In terms of performance, everything is focused on comedy and song and dance. It is also the color of general Hollywood song and dance films. In addition to singing, Judy Garland's expressions are also not bad. Allan Jones, however, is not as outstanding as in "A Day at the Races."

New World… The True and False Wu Zetian

Silent Film

A product that wants to use sensuality and sex appeal as its selling point. It takes a stage actress who is naturally promiscuous as the central character of the movie and uses her stage performance as Wu Zetian and her licentious private life as the material for depiction. The content is bizarre and unfounded, but it may cater to low tastes. However, it does not dare to be thorough in so-called sensual and erotic scenes, which only disappoints the 'show-off' audience and disgusts the average audience.

Central… Sequel to Golden Chrysanthemum

Cantonese Film

The audience who has seen the previous episode will always remember that at the end, Jin Yejú still had a pair stolen by Zhou Zhicheng. The sequel starts from this incident and ends when the gold is returned. The plot is not as tense and tortuous as the previous episode, and the performance is also very mediocre. However, there are still many places that can win the tears of some stupid audiences, such as Zheng Shanxiao being framed and imprisoned, and Xiao Yanfei visiting him in prison. The consistent style of the story cannot be avoided. We don't need to watch it to guess the plot of the movie. Sure enough, this ideal is not wrong. Cao Tongwen is not suitable for performing in this type of movie. The scenery and photography are still acceptable in South China, but the sound recording is a failure.

Taiping… Cantonese Opera

Taiping Male and Female Opera Troupe

Daytime Performance… Temporarily Suspended

Evening Performance… Yin Yang Fan

Gao Sheng… Cantonese Opera

Xing Zhonghua Opera Troupe

Daytime Performance… Xi Shi's Love Trapped by Zhao Longzi

Evening Performance… Miserable Three Grandsons

### Sunset

— Cao Juren

——Impressions from a Wartime Journey

My friend Ke Yun has a wartime reportage titled "Ruin and Sunset," describing the desolate sunset scene outside Taierzhuang after the battle. The concluding paragraph reads:

"Returning to the city from the wheat fields, there was a dog corpse lying on the hillside. Walking a few steps, there were two more × corpses lying face up on the dirt, their upper bodies covered with yellow mud, leaving only their legs exposed, with rubber boots still on their feet. A ray of the setting sun swept over his body. This impression floated into our hearts. A soldier's poem:

Why are we fighting?

The Chinese have suffered great hardship,

We too have suffered disaster,

Oh heaven, oh heaven!

Who will collect our scattered bones?

This poem also often echoes in our ears. The mood of this poem and the mood of 'desolate sunset' are so harmonious that we felt extremely complex in that moment of inspiration. One evening, I was alone outside the north gate of Shangrao watching the sunset and was again reminded of this scene. I suddenly felt that this mood was too familiar. I suddenly realized that this is the mood of the end of the century—貫徹×(Consistent) basic mood in all the war-reporting poems and articles written by people.

Yesterday, I suddenly opened the Iroha poem written by the Japanese monk Kukai. The song's sentences read:

The crimson and purple blossoms, what is the reason for their falling?

Gazing upon the world, how much remains?

Deluded in the illusion, now surpassing it,

The lingering dream has awakened, neither drunk nor crazy.

It turns out that what permeates the Japanese national psyche is this set of end-of-century moods. As the saying goes, "The sun sets, the road ends, acting perversely." The Japanese militarists' invasion craze is just a perverse chapter played out by an end-of-century mentality.

Every one of the Japanese militarists is good material for Freud's mental hospital. We can deeply understand this sentence only by standing on the side of the Japanese people and removing all national prejudices. On the Japanese side, although there are self-descriptive phrases such as "Land of the Rising Sun" or "Morning Sun," the nobles and militarists who control Japan's national destiny, whether from the achievements of the system itself or from the perspective of this system, have already reached the fate of "sunset" or "end of the century."

The Japanese ruling class and militarists are deeply aware of what the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War will be: this war will never bring a dark fate to the Japanese people, but the Japanese ruling class and militarists will go to the museum arm in arm with the German and Russian ruling classes. This is the general explanation of the various struggling postures of the Japanese militarists.

When the European War first broke out, at the moment when the Tsar signed the declaration of war, he said very tragically: "The terrible test for me is decided, but I will not get any recompense in this lifetime." From the process of the European War, the people under the old Russian hell were liberated, and the fate of the Tsar's system was ended: it truly makes ×× aroused by the sunset how much panic!

### The Sorrow of a Certain Person

— Ren Jun

——Presented to Professor Liang Shiqiu and his comrades

I also want to write some beautiful poems,

Praising my affectionate lover;

But, regrettably, she is still in the occupied area,

And there has been no news for more than a year.

I also want to write a few superb masterpieces,

Deeply hiding them in the famous mountains;

But, regrettably, two of the Five Sacred Mountains have been lost,

And the remaining three are also under × harassment.

I also want to have a sweet dream,

So that I can pursue everything in my dreams;

But, regrettably, there are already bombs exploding around me,

Making it impossible for you to even dream.

I also want to be a noble hermit,

From then on, living in the mountains and forests;

But, regrettably, the Nanyang Islands,

Are said to have built fortifications and stationed heavy troops.

Therefore, I can only beg Professor Liang,

Begging him to point out clearly:

Where is there something "unrelated to the War of Resistance"?

Where is there an environment that is "unrelated to the War of Resistance"?

Worthy of admiration is Professor Liang!

Please don't be stingy with your compass!

Now there is really only one gentleman like you!

(Note) Not long ago, a very lively and intense debate occurred in Chongqing's literary circles. The cause and process of the matter were roughly as follows: Liang Shiqiu, on the first day he took over the editing of the Central Daily News supplement, launched a massive attack in the "Editor's Note" on what he considered the so-called "War of Resistance clichés" and solicited manuscripts "unrelated to the War of Resistance." For a time, the writers living in Chongqing were very dissatisfied and strongly disagreed. Thus, a literary lawsuit began, lasting for a month or two before ending. In addition to Liang, those who participated in this debate, before and after, included Yao Pengzi, Shen Qiyu, Jin Mancheng, Chen Baichen, Song Zhidi... and so on. This poem (if it deserves to be called a poem) was written when the two sides were arguing fiercely. Because I am afraid that readers in other places will not understand, I have added a note as above.

### Mother's Joy

— Crease

——Presented to my brother far away on the battlefield

When you are on the desolate battlefield where the moon is white and the wind is clear, remembering your mother and thinking of home, please remember this sentence: "Without national freedom, there is no mother."

Your mother's tears are an expression of her love, pity, and worry for you, but do not be saddened by this, because your mother's tears are the compass of happiness. If we are suppressed under the iron hooves of ×, there will be days when we want to cry but have no tears.

The wrinkles on your mother's face are deepening day by day, your mother's body is as thin as a reed, and your mother's cheeks are gradually drying up... If you remember these things, then you should raise your spirits, pick up your guns, fix your bayonets, kill all the × heads, and bring back a little blood for your mother to drink heartily, nourishing the reed-like mother to make her fat.

Now that the weather is cold, your mother always likes to bask in the sunshine of the daytime, gaining a little warmth. If the sky is cloudy day by day, then you should raise your fists and unveil the smoky cloud curtain, revealing the blue sky and white sun, illuminating the earth red.

Your youth, your happiness, your joy, your wisdom, your future, your light, your ambition... and everything you have! Do not lose them in your mother's tears.

In her spare time, your mother often talks about the story of Yue Fei. How much she admires Wu Mu's loyalty and bravery! If you want to win your mother's joy, then you should prepare your flags and drums, and under the spark of freedom, step onto the open-air stage and play the story of Yue Fei!

On the day when the whole nation celebrates the victory of the full-scale War of Resistance, you will come back wearing the glorious military crown of freedom. When you walk before the loving heart of your mother, who is standing on the dock looking forward to her beloved son's triumphant return, you should smile and say, "Mother! Your beloved son has returned with freedom."

### "Inspiration"

— Seeking Truth

The Soviet writer M. Zoshchenko, in his "How I Write," said:

"...I have two methods of working. One method is: whenever inspiration strikes, I write with creative impulse. At such times, the work progresses swiftly and flawlessly. The entire picture, the entire structure of things, forms naturally.

"The second method is when there is no inspiration. When encountering such a situation, I write using technical training. In this method of work, I proceed as one usually does with conscious effort: I build a plan for the theme myself, I appropriately arrange each paragraph and each word myself, developing a story from words..."

However, he later further stated, "It (inspiration) is a unique element for a writer, for all of a writer's work. Technique can certainly aid inspiration, supplement its deficiencies; it can also replace inspiration—with technique, one can ultimately avoid lowering one's own quality; however, if there is never any kind of inspiration, that writer will certainly be unable to achieve profound progress."

The reason why 'inspiration' is an indispensable element for literary writing is not just for the convenience of writing! Generally speaking, writing with the impulse of inspiration does indeed lead to writing that is swift and complete; moreover, it is because literature, in its expression of images, must contain moving emotions. It borrows images, passes through sensibility, and then enters into understanding. The writer's understanding, accompanied by the emotional surge of creation, can give the reader "resonance," generating the effect of literature. If there is no genuine emotion, then no matter how correct the writer's worldview is, or how skilled the technique, what is written will be at most a description of principles, a depiction of images; it will always be dead, without infectiousness. The so-called "formalism" and "eight-legged essay" (stereotyped writing), aside from problems with technique, the author's lack of inspiration is also a major reason.

Then what is called 'inspiration'? Zoshchenko believes that 'inspiration is a happy combination of physical health, mental strength, nervous vitality, and unwavering confidence, a combination that sends all of one's abilities to one place! In one situation—in literature.'

This explanation is not very clear. I believe that "inspiration" is the combination of understanding and emotion, that is, the impulse of consciousness. It is by no means the ethereal holy spirit that falls from the sky as commonly misunderstood, but a mental state produced in the practice of life through interaction with things. Therefore, inspiration is also a product of reality. Separated from reality, it is empty and false.

It seems that writers do not need to worry about not having inspiration. As long as you go to engage with reality, to experience life, to delve into the society you want to describe, to practice and comprehend, then, guided by your correct worldview or understanding, there will certainly be many different situations of righteous indignation arising. Only by pursuing and grasping inspiration in this way, and then writing, can you write truthfully, infectiously, and gain the reader's resonance.

Simply having understanding and subject matter, and writing it out raw, will ultimately make people feel forced when reading; because although this may not necessarily be a mere game of words, it ultimately fails to achieve the truthfulness of literature. Writers should restore understanding to phenomena, restore subject matter to reality—that is, they must practice life, so that understanding and subject matter are tempered and melted by the emotions from which they arise, concretely becoming true inspiration, and then written out. Only then will it be good.

Of course, if one already has such inspiration, writing will be even easier to succeed. I hope that they can boldly write more.

### Jottings from a March

— Li Huiying

Passing through downstairs, behind it is the real Confucius Temple. The Chinese-style tiled house, the main hall is full of gilded plaques, but the corners of the house are leaking piles of ash and dirt; the east and west side rooms are overgrown with tall artemisia, and the house is so crooked that it will collapse with a gust of wind. From the broken opening of the leak, sparrows fly in and out, unimpeded. It is said that the scholars of the past doubly cherished living things, so, in this side room of the seventy-two disciples, attracting sparrows to nest, their spirits in heaven should express welcome, right?

Thinking back to those years, it was really not an easy thing for Confucius to travel around in a carriage. Compared to our marching, although we only walk on foot, our spirit is still quite cheerful; as for the old Confucius, although he sat in the military vehicle, he could avoid physical fatigue, but thinking of being blocked everywhere, unable to find a way out on the political stage, and having to use lecturing to comfort his own suffering, it is truly a world of difference!

June - Arrived at the encampment - Old River Street

This day, the team encamped at Old River Street. This small town has a layer of surrounding walls on the outside, like all the towns and cities along the way. Near the town, there are bunkers towering at the corners. In the past, the surrounding walls and bunkers were the so-called solid defense lines for the people to defend public security; but now not even the shadow of an armed comrade can be seen, whether on the bunkers or beside the surrounding walls.

On both sides of the entrance to the street, paper slogans occupy all the empty space, pasted in layers, as if giving the surrounding walls several layers of clothing. Looking into the street, you are struck everywhere by a scene of peace and tranquility. Playing mahjong, chatting idly, smoking water pipes—enough leisure.

The place where we live is a large house at the head of the street. Upon arrival, people compete to wash their feet, and then lie down on the tables and benches to rest, because everyone's legs are sore and painful from walking. To fall asleep here is truly a rare and happy thing.

The quartermaster in charge of food cannot sleep. He comes in once and goes out once, busy without stopping, only hearing him anxiously shout:

"What to do, we can't buy rice!" In a moment, he is complaining again:

Because he understands this secret, (To be continued)
