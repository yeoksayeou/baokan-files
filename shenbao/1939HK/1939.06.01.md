### On the Failure of the × Army's May Offensive and the Future War Situation

The × Army recently heavily publicized its "May Offensive," but after our army's counterattacks over the past two weeks, it has completely failed. This battle is a battle of great historical significance since the end of the first phase of the War of Resistance and the entry into the transitional period. We should have the necessary understanding of this, conduct in-depth research, and use it as a reference for striving for the final victory.

The × Army's "May Offensive" was launched in early May. According to a Hankou telegram from the × Army's propaganda organization, the Allied News Agency, on May 12: "A Japanese military spokesman announced today that the Japanese army is carrying out a huge scissor movement tactical plan in northern Hubei, claiming that the Chinese army's 12th division has been completely cornered. The Chinese 9th division has been defeated by the Japanese army. The Japanese army's encirclement of northern Henan will converge in the Zao Yang east area, which is about 150 miles northwest of Hankou." A telegram from the same agency on the same day and location also stated, "The Japanese army's encirclement of the Chinese army's 20th division has shrunk into an ellipse with a length of 10 miles east-west and 30 miles north-south. The remaining Chinese army under the command of Generals Li Zongren and Tang Enbo has been cut off from the rear and is now trying to break through in thousands. The Japanese army is annihilating the Chinese 9th division and is now advancing to encircle Zao Yang, which is the left-wing base of the Fifth War Zone of the Chinese army." The main purpose of this "May Offensive" by the × Army, which has been so shamelessly and exaggeratedly publicized, was to use "blitzkrieg tactics" or the so-called "Sedan tactics" to eliminate the best and most elite troops in central China. Implement the "Great Xiangyang Fancheng Advance" to create a situation where the × Army in northern Henan and southern Shanxi could covet Guanzhong and open a "shortcut" to bypass northwestern Hunan Province to support the × Army on the Hunan-Guangdong border in opening up the entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway line. At the same time, politically, it could ease the internal anti-war sentiment on the one hand and frustrate the spirit of our country's persistence in the long-term war of resistance, while facilitating the traitors' faction in carrying out the conspiracy to subjugate all of China under the guise of "peace, anti-communism, and saving China."

Beginning on May 1, the × Army launched a general offensive on all fronts. The × Army's northern route captured Tongbai in early May, Xinye on the 11th, and Tanghe on the 12th, attempting to outflank southward. At the same time, the right wing of the × Army's southern route captured Suixian. Zao Yang, the left wing advanced north from Zhongxiang, crossing Yicheng Xiangyang. However, the × Army's northern route was intercepted by our southern Henan army group, and it showed signs of collapse on the 17th. The third division, the right wing of the × Army's southern route, was severely attacked head-on by our left-wing army, suffering heavy casualties. Zao Yang and Suixian were also recovered one after another. The left wing of the × Army's southern route was attacked on its flank by our Hedong troops. After more than a week of fierce fighting, thousands of casualties were suffered. After the 17th, the × Army not only discovered that its plan to "annihilate 20 divisions of the Chinese army" had been shattered, but the × Army itself had been encircled and annihilated by us.

According to the war report released by the Military Affairs Commission, in this battle in central Hubei, more than 20,000 × soldiers were killed, and the wounded were countless. The main forces of the × Fujita, Fujie, and Ogishima divisions, and the Kojima Cavalry Brigade suffered losses of more than half. The × Army's flanking encirclement conspiracy has been completely shattered by us. Since the recapture of Xinye, Tanghe, and Tongbai in southern Henan, and Zao Yang and Suixian in northern Hubei, and Duobaowan, Luohansi, Yuxincun, Wamiaoji, Yanmenkou, and Yuekou and other key locations in Xiangjiang, the remaining × soldiers have mostly fled to the vicinity, and have been continuously pursued by our army in a manner like a tiger pouncing on a rabbit for days. By the 29th, the situation of surrounding and annihilating the enemy had been formed. At dawn that day, the attack began. In one day and night, more than a thousand × soldiers were annihilated. The last stronghold of the × Army in central Hubei was on the verge of crisis, and the × Army in Wuhan gradually came under our control. According to a telegram from Commander Li, who was in command of the battle in northern Hubei, since May 1, × had advanced on Sui, Zao, and Fan in three routes with three divisions and a cavalry brigade, along the Xianghua Highway on the front. After our army, led by Lian Fangjun, fought fiercely from solid fortifications, nearly 5,000 × soldiers were annihilated. Other large armies took advantage of the × breakthrough to launch joint attacks on separate routes, annihilating nearly 10,000 × soldiers in total. × was exhausted and fled in panic. Sui and Zao were successively overcome. In addition, Reuters also fully confirmed the Central News Agency's report of the "miserable defeat of the × Army in central Hubei," pointing out that "the entire Japanese front has collapsed." The × side's allied propaganda organization, Haitong News Agency, also reported on the 25th that "a Japanese military spokesman said that the Japanese army in northern Hubei has retreated to the southern line of the Dabie Mountains and has changed to a defensive posture." On the 30th, the agency reported on the battle in Hubei Province, saying, "The front line is silent" and "The Japanese army is continuing to retreat to Jing Shan"!

The × Army thus slapped itself in the face, admitting all the exaggeration and unfoundedness of its propaganda!

How did the × Army fail? First, as we pointed out in previous editorials and "One Week," the × Army is currently encountering increasingly serious difficulties in military affairs, namely, insufficient troops, dangerous transportation, unfavorable terrain, difficulty in using troops, and a weak rear. This is the most common and serious difficulty encountered by the × Army after the war entered the transitional period and even the stalemate stage, and it is also a difficulty that the Japanese side itself cannot solve. The main reason for the failure of the "May Offensive" lies in this. In the future, the × Army will inevitably continue to encounter failure because of this. Second, due to the existence of these military difficulties, it is difficult for the × Army to adopt appropriate strategies. This "May Offensive" not only made the above-mentioned difficulties more serious because the encirclement line was too long, but also the encirclement was precisely the Dahongshan Tongbai Mountain, where the combat situation was completely favorable to us. As a result, the × Army turned into encircling itself due to the flexible use of our mobile warfare tactics! Third, in terms of tactics, the × people also made a huge mistake. They almost completely did not consider how to solve the difficulties such as obstructed transportation, unfavorable terrain, and a weak rear. Therefore, after they advanced and penetrated deeply with high spirits, when the power of their modern weapons was exhausted, we immediately took the initiative to turn the tables and gain the initiative, allowing us to "pursue the defeated enemy with the posture of a tiger pouncing on a rabbit!"

How did our army win? As the Central News Agency pointed out in its Chongqing telegram on the 30th, "In this operation, our army adopted a new strategy and implemented a comprehensive war. Therefore, our army launched attacks on all fronts, making it extremely difficult for the × Army to deploy its forces in various war zones, and there were no troops available for transfer in their country. Therefore, × could not mobilize more troops in this encirclement and attack on northern Hubei, such as the invasion of Xuzhou Wuhan and the attack on Xiangfan in the first phase of the war. The reason lies in this!" This is a general victory factor. Not only is the victory in northern Hubei today based on this, but also the future continued prevention of the × Army's offensive and the preparation of our army to fight for the final victory are all based on this. The criticisms and curses of the mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare by Wang Jingwei and other stubborn and conservative elements show that they are only speaking for the Japanese aggressors! As for the specifics, this victory is due, first, to the fact that our front-line troops in northern Hubei and southern Henan are good at revolutionary mobile warfare, good at developing the difficulties of the × Army and promoting the advantages of our army; second, to the fact that our army is good at exerting the power of combat behind the enemy lines, cooperating with the front-line regular combat. The main points are: (1) Our army on the Hanyi Road constantly threatens the × rear; (2) Our army on the Pinghan Road constantly attacks Wushengguan, Gongshan and other places to intercept the × Army's supplies; (3) Our army in various parts of southern Henan closely cooperates with the armies in northern Hubei, launching side attacks on the × Army attacking on the northern route; (4) Our army in the Hunan-Jiangxi-Hubei border, under the leadership of General Chen Cheng, counterattacks Nanchang and other places, while our New Fourth Army and others in Anhui Province simultaneously develop counterattacks, such as surrounding Hefei, all of which are sufficient to contain the × Army in central Hubei and help win this great victory.

The main purpose of the × Army's "May Offensive" was to cooperate with the political offensive of the new strategy of the Japanese × invasion of China. They attempted to consolidate the occupied areas east of the Pinghan and Guangdong-Hankou Railways through the "May Offensive," and cooperate with Wang Jingwei and others' political conspiracy of "peace, anti-communism, and saving China" to destroy our war of resistance front, strengthen their rule in the occupied areas, plunder and exploit them, and prepare for further conquest of all of China and even dominate East Asia! Although the "May Offensive" in northern Hubei has failed, a "June Offensive" of the same significance in northern Hunan or even Chaoshan may continue to be planned and realized. Therefore, we should accept and study the experience and lessons of this victory, and make redoubled efforts to increase the difficulties of the × Army today, to develop the progress of our army today. We must step up the expansion of guerrilla warfare behind the enemy lines, strengthen the combat strength of the front line, and step up all political work in the war zone and behind the enemy lines. The failure of the × Army's "May Offensive" has proved that the golden age of the × Army has passed! The stalemate stage, in which our strength is evenly matched with the × Army and even the × Army has begun to degenerate, is about to be fully realized! We must tighten the unity of the entire nation and persist in the long-term war of resistance to welcome a greater victory!

### Understanding the Unified Front of Chinese Youth (Part 1)

— Special Air Dispatch from Xi'an

The unified front of Chinese youth is not only necessary and possible, but also a reality.

The unified front of Chinese youth has its characteristics. Every comrade who strives for the unity and solidarity of the Chinese youth movement must first understand the unique aspects of the unified front of Chinese youth.

The unified front of Chinese youth is national and belongs to all youth. This makes it very different from that in many European and American countries. In those countries, the youth movement, like the general mass movement, often bears the color of a people's front, but the Chinese youth movement resists foreign aggression and is a patriotic movement, so it is more widespread than in those countries. The unified front of Chinese youth is long-term. Because first, China's war of resistance is a war of resistance of a weak country against a strong country, and it cannot but be long-term, so the unified front of youth cannot but be long-term; second, the unified front of Chinese youth is not only for the war of resistance, but also for building a democratic republic based on the Three People's Principles, which is even more likely to be a long-term process.

The unified front of Chinese youth has developed under the condition of scattered and unorganized youth masses. We must not only seek the unity of organized youth, but also unite millions and tens of millions of unorganized youth. Otherwise, the foundation of our unified front will be empty. Therefore, organizing unorganized youth is precisely for the unity of youth. The scope of this work is vast, and even if all existing organizational forces are used to carry it out, there will be no duplication of work.

The development of the unified front of Chinese youth is uneven. The political consciousness and political strength of various classes vary, so that the youth who participate in the unified front now are mainly intellectuals. Although workers and peasants support the unified front, they rarely have the right and the possibility to participate in the organization and actions of the unified front. The political, military, economic, and cultural conditions of various regions also differ, which has a great impact on the development of the unified front of youth. In some places, the youth movement has already achieved complete unity, while in other places it is much worse. In some places, even any youth organization cannot exist, let alone a unified front of youth. This uneven development in both aspects, coupled with the ever-changing domestic and international situation, makes the development process of the unified front of Chinese youth very tortuous and complex. If we cannot recognize this, cannot flexibly grasp the specific situation at that time and place, and only want to reach the sky in one step, or only rely on a uniform formula, we cannot but feel disappointed in our actual work.

Moreover, the unified front of Chinese youth also faces many objective difficulties.

The long-term sharp discord among various classes, parties, and ethnic groups in our nation in the past still has some influence. The vast majority of the people and the vast majority of youth want to unite and unite for a long time, but there are a few stubborn elements who disregard the overall situation and do not understand the great righteousness, or because their class interests and national interests have contradictions, or because they specialize in making rumors, slanders, and sowing discord for a living, and are villains who specialize in eating "friction rice," but they are hindering us everywhere. They want to steal the Three People's Principles and replace them with One People's Principle, replace unity with ××, replace resistance to Japan with ××××, and want to lead the cause of national unity and youth unity astray. Japanese spies and some of their accomplices, traitors ×× pro-Japanese factions, took advantage of the situation and set various conspiracies to undermine our mutual unity, mutual understanding, and mutual understanding among our youth.

The long-term lack of democratic politics in our nation in the past also has a great impact. Ninety-nine percent of the people and youth cannot live an organized life and do not know what organizational habits and organizational concepts are. Traditional politics does not allow the masses to have their own organizations, and it does not like the youth to have their own organizations. Traditional politics either despises youth, hates youth, or suspects and fears youth, and the result is always to restrict youth activities. Therefore, even now, there are still many places where youth activities cannot get public and legal opportunities, and the freedom and safety of youth often lack the minimum guarantee. These all make it difficult for us to change unorganized youth into organized youth and to change the unbalanced situation into balanced work.

The lives of young people are often too painful, and youth education is very backward. Illiteracy accounts for the vast majority. Most young people have to work 12 to 16 hours a day. Except for insufficient sleep, they have no leisure time. Even if there is leisure time, it is not their own. Factory workers often cannot get the factory's permission to establish anti-Japanese support associations, or even to receive some military training stipulated by the government. Some employers take advantage of the national crisis to make a fortune from the labor of young people. Since young people are unable to take care of themselves, it is naturally very difficult to carry out extensive unity.

Conservative families also severely restrict youth. The policy of parents towards their children, especially their wives and daughters, is not to allow them to take a step out of the door and not to allow them to have contact with outsiders. Many young women are in a state of semi-slavery. When they are still ignorant, foot-binding and the buying and selling of marriages have already tightly bound their bodies and spirits.

Youth themselves also have some weaknesses. Because China is a backward country, most of the early cadres of the youth movement are still intellectuals. Although they have their strengths, their strengths are not easily compiled when they approach rural youth and military youth. Also, because Chinese youth suffer too much oppression, their fighting spirit is very high, and they often walk in front of the general mass movement, showing a unique pioneering spirit. This pioneering spirit makes us active, brave, and enthusiastic, which is originally good, but it may also make us sometimes not calm enough and not have far-sighted eyes, thus tending to be extreme.

Fully understanding these characteristics and difficulties of the unified front of Chinese youth is very important for our work. Only in this way can we truly strengthen our beliefs, adhere to our policies, break through obstacles and find a way out. We can now foresee that our speed of advance will temporarily not be universally great within the scope of the whole country, our road of advance will inevitably be rugged and tortuous, and we will inevitably suffer some setbacks and encounter some adverse currents, but at the same time we can also detect that the prospect of our national and long-term youth unified front will inevitably be victorious.

But our task cannot stop at verbal predictions. We must study the laws of development of the unified front of Chinese youth with these characteristics and difficulties. We must grasp all past experiences and lessons so that we can better adapt to today's specific situation and be able to carry out our work more smoothly.

Our experiences and lessons have the following aspects:

First, the basic principle of unified front work is to be truly loyal to the interests of the country and the nation, and to truly achieve "resistance to Japan is above everything, and everything is subordinate to resistance to Japan." We must treat all young people who resist Japan equally, and we must participate in all undertakings that resist Japan, because this is beneficial to resisting Japan. We must persuade all young people who oppose unity, and we must reject all behaviors that undermine unity, because this is beneficial to resisting Japan. We will also have disputes in our work. What should we do then? If making concessions is beneficial to resisting Japan, we should make concessions. If making concessions goes beyond the scope of being beneficial to resisting Japan and weakens the strength of resisting Japan, we should adhere to our position.

Second, for the sake of the interests of resisting Japan, the inside of the unified front must respect each other, help each other, and develop each other. It is impossible to have a unified front if you only see yourself and not others, and if you only care about your own individual development and do not allow everyone to develop together. Resisting Japan requires strengthening the strength of the whole, not digging out flesh to mend sores, or drawing from the left hand to add to the right hand.

In some schools in one place, a small number of students organized a group. Today, they beat up a few teachers, and tomorrow, they drive away a few students. After all the trouble, even if everyone is afraid of it, they never admire it or sympathize with it. How many people did it have when it was launched, and how many people does it still have after a year and a half.

Conversely, if they are humble, helpful, sincere, and loving to each other, then they will all benefit. In a small school in Taiwan, there used to be two teachers who disagreed with each other. One person was in charge of a night school. The first night school had many students, but the second night school did not have a single student. At this time, the teacher in charge of the first night school voluntarily brought the students there to the second night school and cooperated with the teacher in charge of the second night school. Later, the feelings of the two teachers became completely harmonious, and their night school flourished. Although this is a very small matter, it contains a great truth.

Third, for the sake of the interests of resisting Japan, the unified front must strive to be conscious and self-reliant, and must be democratic, and cannot take tough measures. Each person has his own thoughts and beliefs, and each organization also has its own special history and special position. They are unwilling to suddenly disappear unconditionally. It is of course possible to increase strength if several organizations merge with each other in an appropriate way, but if the method is improper and some organizations feel that they are not automatic but passive, and that it is not a merger but an annexation, then it will only destroy the precious vitality of the country and the nation. The more you want to increase strength, the more strength will decrease. The more you want to unify youth, the more youth will not be unified. For example, a man and a woman who do not understand each other can gradually understand each other. If they are forced to marry, they will only be at odds with each other all day long, and if they have a chance, they will still divorce. (Laughter)

Fourth, the establishment of a unified front is a process. Usually, to achieve organizational unity, it often starts with the unity of action. The experiences of the youth movements in Xi'an, Guangzhou, Wenzhou, and other places have proved that a concrete and daily unity of action is more effective than all empty and formal unity.

The students of Jinan University in Shanghai were in a state of division for a very long time. During the War of Resistance in Suiyuan, some students initiated a fundraising campaign for winter clothing for the soldiers on the front line. The fundraising campaign was first started by the president of the school, and then all the teachers and students of the school participated. A unified management committee was organized. This movement later developed into a one-cent-a-day movement for the whole school, and it has been affecting the entire city of Shanghai. (To be continued)

### Our Army Rapidly Advances in the Bloody Battle in Central Hubei, Besieging Zhongxiang and Fiercely Attacking the × Army Invading Southward, Sweeping Northern Hubei Smoothly and Clearing Away the Remaining × Soldiers

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing from Our Newspaper on the 30th] The great battle in central Hubei, aimed at preventing the × Army from crossing the Xiang River, has continued for two days and nights. The × Army has invaded in two routes. One route is spying on Yichang along the Hanyi Highway and has been intercepted by us in the Luohansi area. The other route is scurrying southward and has invaded Yuekou Town. Our troops on the northeast bank of the Xiang River are reinforcing the area. The sweep in northern Hubei is proceeding smoothly. All strongholds have been recovered. The remaining × soldiers have been cleared away. Zhongxiang, an important stronghold with decisive significance for the victory or defeat of the battlefield in central Hubei, is being besieged on three sides and will be recaptured soon.

[Reuters Dispatch from Chongqing on the 31st] Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission General Feng Yuxiang announced that the defeated and残 (remnants/defeated) Japanese troops in northern Hubei have been forced to retreat 200 li. The Japanese army has suffered 25,000 casualties on that line. According to estimates by the Chinese military authorities, the total number of Japanese casualties since the start of the war is 870,000. General Feng dismissed the number of casualties claimed by the Japanese side as completely exaggerated and inaccurate. General Feng also expressed extreme satisfaction with the training and morale of the Chinese new army.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Xi'an on the 30th] Military intelligence: the × soldiers between Dezhou and Jinpu on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, with nearly 10,000 troops, have launched a large-scale invasion from En County Yuanping and breached the Yellow River north and south on the 25th and 26th. Our army engaged in more than 20 melee combats with the × soldiers. The × soldiers suffered more than 1,000 casualties and retreated to Daizhuang Kou in Tai'an. We are still pursuing the attack.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Chongqing on the 30th] News from Shanghai: fierce battles have been raging for days between Jiaxing and Jiashan on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. The bridge between Xin Zhuang has been destroyed by our army, and the highway has also been cut off in two places. The × troops have been trapped inside and have repeatedly tried to break out to make contact, but they have been repulsed by our army. A few days ago, 200 × soldiers in Jia Shan tried to break out again to go to Jia Xing, but they were fiercely attacked by our army. The × soldiers suffered 140 casualties, and the remaining 50 fled back to Jia Shan and are now holding on to the trenches.

[Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Shanghai on the 31st] Chinese guerrillas are very active on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway between Jia Xing and 南 (South). Japanese artillery departed from Hangzhou, attempting to intercept the guerrillas, but the railway near Jia Xing has recently been cut off.

[Fast News from Continental News Agency, Zhaoqing] The war on the upper reaches of the western front has become tense again. The × Army has transferred hundreds of infantry and cavalry and more than ten tanks from Guangzhou Foshan to reinforce the He Kou in the southwest and the Ma Kou area, seemingly intending to invade west, spying on the Sui River coast. On the 26th, 27th, and 28th, they all sent small units to attack Lu Bao, Jin Li, Ma Fang, Lu Cun, etc., but they were severely repulsed by our army and could not advance an inch.

### Great Victory for Us in the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region; Fierce Battles for Over Ten Days Result in Over a Thousand Enemy Deaths; Enemy Reinforcements Arrive Attempting to Re-Offend

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 30th] Since the beginning of this month, the enemy has successively transferred approximately 15,000 troops from the Pinghan, Zhengtai, and Tongpu lines to penetrate deep into the inland areas of the Jin-Ji-Cha border region for a "mopping-up" operation. Their goal is to open transportation routes from Wutai to Fuping, Wutai to Daying, and X-county to Laiyuan. They first attacked our troops in the area and then proceeded to build highways, launching offensives from areas east of Wutai and south of X-county's Doucun and Dongzhi towns. Starting from the 7th, they engaged in several days of combat with us in villages and towns such as Nanru Village, Hengqiang, Dagu, Jiangfang, and Xiakou. On the 10th and 11th, the enemy, under the cover of aircraft, continued their eastward advance, and Gaohongkou and Gengzhen fell into enemy hands. Another enemy force advanced southward from Shahe and D, east of Fanshan, attempting to join forces with the enemy advancing eastward from Wutai to attack Taihuai Tie (northwest of Longquanguan in northeastern Wutai). On the 13th, over 700 enemies from Daying advanced to the vicinity of Shangxia Yaojian in northeastern Wutai, where they were surrounded by us. After a fierce battle lasting a day and night, most of them were wiped out, and the remaining 200-plus enemy troops fled back to Daying. The enemy advancing southward from Shahe was intercepted by us near Shizi Slope and repeatedly attempted to break through, but without success. After the victory north of Taihuai, the momentum of the enemy advancing eastward from Wutai was shaken. We seized the opportunity to counterattack and recovered Gengzhen and Gaohongkou on the 15th and 16th. The enemy retreated to the Nanru Village area. The enemy on the Pinghan Line frequently reinforced Qu Yang, Dangcheng, and Lingshou from Wangdu, Dingxian, and Zhengding, totaling no less than 4,000 troops. On the 9th, over 500 enemy troops from Dingxian advanced westward but were ambushed by us, leaving behind over a hundred corpses before fleeing eastward. On the 8th, several agricultural enemy troops and over a hundred soldiers in eleven vehicles departed from Shijiazhuang for Lingshou, but were ambushed by us en route in Shangqu Yang. Seven enemy vehicles were destroyed, and over thirty enemy troops were killed. After being struck by us, the enemy invading westward from Yixian regrouped over a thousand infantry and artillery troops to invade Dalonghua to the west. On the evening of the 20th, we bravely met their attack, and the battle lasted until the 21st, resulting in a victory for us. Over 400 enemy troops were killed, and one enemy captain, eight soldiers, and 120 puppet troops were captured alive. The remaining enemy troops fled towards Lianggezhuang, and Dalonghua was recovered by us. At the same time, a portion of the enemy, over 300 troops, advanced eastward from Laiyuan, attempting to join forces with the enemy from Yixian. They were soundly defeated by us near Futu Valley and retreated. In summary, since the beginning of the month, we have engaged in over thirty continuous bloody battles with the enemy in the Jin-Ji-Cha border region, and finally the enemy's eastward advance from Wutai, eastward attacks from Doucun, southward attacks from Daying Shahe, and westward attacks from the two counties of Ding and Yi were all defeated individually. The battles of Taihuai North and Dalonghua were particularly fruitful, with us killing over a thousand enemy troops, seizing three Type 93 mountain guns, one mortar, over forty light and heavy machine guns, over three hundred rifles, one hundred warhorses, three vehicles, and many important documents. Currently, the enemy on the northern section of the Tongpu line is still continuing to reinforce Wutai, attempting to launch another large-scale offensive.

[Central News Agency, Hequ, 30th] On the 26th, over a thousand enemy troops again advanced towards Dagounei Hejiadian in the Anbei area, using smoke screens. Our troops bravely met their attack and, after a hard-fought battle until the afternoon, defeated the enemy, killing over forty of them. We also suffered some casualties.

### The Shanghai Three-Power Talks: Significant Meaning; Unified Action Against Japan in the Future; The Outcome of the Talks Will Influence British Diplomatic Notes; A Major Turning Point in the Far Eastern Situation Is Expected

[Our Newspaper Shanghai 31st Special Dispatch] According to usually reliable sources, the ambassadors of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France held a meeting last night at the British Consulate General here, lasting three hours. However, as of this morning, this information has not been officially confirmed.

[Our Newspaper Shanghai 31st Special Dispatch] The French Ambassador to China, S-M, met with the British Ambassador yesterday morning for approximately one hour. However, both British and French officials have not confirmed this information.

[Associated Press London 30th] Britain is now preparing to expand its Far Eastern policy, shifting from economic assistance to China to resisting Japan, in order to counter Japan's threat to British interests in China. Britain is currently actively considering issuing a diplomatic note to Japan, the wording of which will depend on Japan's actions in the coming days. If Japan's actions interfering with British interests in China show some restraint, the wording of the British diplomatic note will be moderate. If Japan continues to pressure British shipping and demand the seizure of sovereignty over the public concessions, Britain will adopt economic defense measures to impose sanctions on Japan. British government legal experts are currently studying various methods and may include requests in the diplomatic note as needed. Due to the delay in discussions among various departments, this diplomatic note will not be sent to Tokyo for several days. The diplomatic representatives and naval commanders of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are currently discussing the following issues in Shanghai: (1) the Japanese Navy's blockade of the Chinese coast; (2) the Japanese military's demand to rule the public concessions; (3) the crisis in Gulangyu. The outcome of these talks in Shanghai is bound to influence Britain's diplomatic note to Japan.

### Long Time No See, General Song Xilian

— Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Ya

From X-X place, riding in a special military vehicle, on a night controlled by the dark, as if deceiving the heavens to cross the sea, arrived at X-X county near the Longhai Railway. General Song Xilian, the famous anti-Japanese general during the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle, leads his brave soldiers, quietly and silently, in recuperating here, waiting for the counter-offensive period to arrive. He will leap out like a divine dragon and drive the Japanese out of the country.

The reporter met General Song, who was promoted from the 36th Division Commander to the X-X Army Commander, on such a dark night. He first narrated his movements after the Shanghai Battle, then talked about the international situation, and finally concluded the conversation with optimistic and excited words about the war situation.

"After the August 13th Shanghai Battle," he was lost in reminiscences of the past: "I bid farewell to those comrades who exchanged their blood and flesh for the lives of the Japanese, and who died on the battlefield. Leading more than two thousand battle-hardened brothers, I went to Nanjing for replenishment and training. When we completed our replenishment and training, and were preparing to return to the front lines, the Japanese iron hooves were already advancing madly towards Nanjing! At this time, we joined the battle to defend Nanjing, and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese for eight days under continuous artillery fire!"

"After the abandonment of Nanjing, my troops went to Jiangxi, first to reorganize, and then went north to Xuzhou, where under the command of General Li Zongren, we participated in the annihilation battle of Heierzhuang. Then we rushed to Macheng in Hubei, and fought a bloody battle with the violent Japanese for fifty days in the great battle to defend Wuhan! After that, we went to Nanyang in Henan for reorganization, and then came to this place. Recalling the brothers during the August 13th Battle, they have now all been promoted to squad leaders."

"During the battle of Nanjing, a squad leader in my unit was captured by the Japanese. Together with other officers and soldiers from friendly forces, they were taken by the Japanese to an open space and machine-gunned. This squad leader was very clever. As soon as the Japanese machine gun fired, he pretended to be shot and killed. After lying still for more than two hours, he secretly raised his head to escape. Who knew that the Japanese guards had not left? He was stabbed twice by the Japanese, but he remained silent and pretended to be dead. At night, he pressed his wound tightly and escaped from the pile of bloody corpses back to the unit, and has been promoted to company commander. He often tells the new recruits the story of his escape and the brutality of the Japanese. Therefore, the brothers have a common belief: 'Even if we are surrounded, we can only fight to the death. We cannot be captured!'"

"The brothers are always incomparably brave in every battle. Especially in the Battle of Fujin Mountain, we defeated the Japanese 13th Division in a rout! More than four thousand Japanese soldiers were annihilated and wounded by us, and we also wounded one of their brigade commanders. Now every veteran has one or two trophies from the Japanese."

"From the previous battles, I can see that the Japanese combat ability and spirit are declining day by day, and weakening more and more. Until recently, the attacking edge of the Japanese is often cut off by us everywhere. Our army has improved in both technology and weaponry. This intuition alone is enough to make every Chinese optimistic and excited about the future of the war."

"Speaking of international issues, the most prominent thing is that the totalitarian countries such as Germany and Italy are pressing the United Kingdom and France more and more fiercely. The United Kingdom and France have reached a point where there is no retreat, so a world war will break out sooner or later. After the outbreak of the European War, the situation in China may be a bit more difficult, but this is an inevitable process in the Sino-Japanese War. However, we know that the current war is an economic war. The United Kingdom and the United States are helping us. On the one hand, it is because we are fighting well and others look up to us, thinking that we are a nation worthy of help. On the other hand, it is also because China has fertile land and abundant mineral resources. If our country was a desert, then the United Kingdom and the United States would not have any need to help us. Therefore, as long as we work hard to develop resources and stabilize the currency, we have a sufficient country with manpower, financial resources, and material resources, and we are fighting against a country with little land, few people, and financial difficulties. As long as we are united, we are confident of defeating the Japanese. As for the Japanese fighting on our land, letting their iron hooves trample on it, and giving us all kinds of pain and difficulties, that doesn't matter. During the European War, the German army also fought on French soil. When it was over, because of the economic collapse of Germany, he had to withdraw from French soil completely, and France still won the final victory."

After saying goodbye to Song Xilian, I went to X-X village, dozens of miles away from here, to visit the mechanized troops training there. Near X-X village, I saw tanks as numerous as ants crawling around, running back and forth. The reporter felt infinite surprise and excitement! Looking back at the villagers coming and going, they all regarded it as nothing, just like the residents of Shanghai have no feeling for the speeding cars. It turned out that they were already accustomed to it. The reporter then went to visit the person in charge of the team and had a long talk with him. However, most of what was discussed was related to military secrets and could not be publicly disclosed. But there is one sentence that can be told to the readers, that is: When the third phase - the counter-offensive period - begins, all the elite soldiers and mechanized troops will jump on all the battlefields of the country and launch a fierce attack on the defeated Japanese, driving them all the way down the Yalu River!

### Admiral Oikawa Hosts a Banquet for Naval Commanders from Various Countries

[Reuters Shanghai 31st] Admiral Oikawa, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese X China Fleet, will host a banquet on the flagship "Izumo" tomorrow, supposedly to entertain British Naval Commander Noble, US Naval Commander Yarnell, French Naval Commander Beaucorps, and Italian Naval Commander Gogent. Noble will visit Oikawa on Friday to discuss various issues, primarily to seek a solution to the Gulangyu incident. Foreigners here believe that the chances of the talks succeeding are slim. Especially since semi-official sources say that the Japanese Navy landed in Xiamen this afternoon as reinforcements. The purpose of the Japanese Navy's landing in Xiamen is currently unknown.

### Gulangyu: More Japanese Troops Land; The Purpose is to Demonstrate

[Haitong News Agency Shanghai 31st] A Japanese military spokesperson explained on Wednesday that the reason why the Japanese military sent more troops to land in Xiamen was due to the surge in anti-Japanese movements in Gulangyu and the concessions. However, neutral observers believe that the Japanese reinforcement is likely to demonstrate to the British, American, and French navies landing in Gulangyu.

[Haitong News Agency Tokyo 31st] The telephone lines between Xiamen and Gulangyu are out of service because an English ship carelessly dropped anchor there on Monday and cut off the undersea telephone cable. Japanese engineers have now begun investigating.

### Shanghai Japanese Organizations Threaten the Municipal Council; Declare That if the Land Regulations Are Not Revised, the Japanese Side Will Take the Final Effective Steps

[Associated Press Shanghai 31st] The Japanese-language newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun" claimed today that the Japanese Road Association has issued a declaration urging the Municipal Council to change the election system, give taxpayers greater "rights," and suppress anti-Japanese terrorist activities. The newspaper also said that the Road Association is prepared to convene a Japanese meeting when necessary to discuss ways to deal with the concession authorities. If the Municipal Council does not change the "Land Regulations" and ignores the demands of the Japanese, the Japanese side will take the final steps to achieve its goals.

[Associated Press Shanghai 31st] The Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department has returned the registration certificate to the "Ta Mei Bao," allowing the newspaper to resume publication on June 2nd. However, the "Ta Mei Bao" authorities have decided to publish a weekly magazine in the future instead of a daily newspaper. According to reports, the "Ta Mei Bao" was stripped of its registration certificate on the 19th for publishing a summary of Chairman Jiang's speech, because the Municipal Council believed that the summary of the speech "harms the peace and order of the Public Concession."

### The Japanese Side Promotes Big Propaganda, Attempting to Attack Outer Mongolia; The Japanese Kwantung Army Issues a Proclamation; The Ambitions Are Revealed

[Shanghai 31st] According to a dispatch from the Japanese Domei News Agency, the crisis on the Manchurian-Mongolian border became more tense today, because the Japanese Kwantung Army has decided to counterattack Mongolia and carry out a "mopping-up" operation. The commander of the Kwantung Army issued a proclamation at 4:10 pm yesterday, saying, "The current situation on the border is entirely caused by the illegal entry of Mongolian troops into Manchuria". Because the Outer Mongolian army has repeatedly attempted to sabotage the territory of Manchuria, the Kwantung Army has now made a final decision to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Japan-Manchuria Agreement, and, together with the Manchurian army, will adopt a cooperation to defend the territory". The proclamation expressed serious concern about the participation of Soviet aircraft in the war, and said that in the recent air battle, a large number of Soviet aircraft were shot down and fell within the territory of Manchuria. Yesterday, the activity of the army and air force in the border area was extremely frequent, as if a fierce war had broken out on the border. According to reports from the Japanese side, hundreds of Soviet and Mongolian aircraft participated in the battle. The number of Japanese participants was not announced, but the proclamation claimed that 42 Soviet aircraft were shot down, while the Japanese side lost one aircraft, and the pilot of this aircraft landed on the Japanese line with a parachute. The puppet state of Manchuria also followed the Japanese and issued a new protest to Mongolia. Domei News Agency said that the nature of the protest was "like an ultimatum", stating that the Manchurian army has closely cooperated with the Japanese army and adopted "self-defense" measures, and firmly demanded that the Mongolian army stop illegal activities.

### Guangdong Party Affairs and Finance Are Actively Improving

[Our Newspaper Shaoguan 31st Special Dispatch] Recent key policy measures of the Guangdong Finance Department include: (1) The financial personnel training class has completed its term and is assigned to serve in various counties, and tax affairs in various counties and cities are progressing well.

### Inspection Diary of Hanoi

— Lin Huanping

(Continued from the May 30th edition)

"(Won Lort Correspondence) Wang Jingwei and X-X-X-X, recklessly create peace talks, betraying the party and the country in the first place, and sowing discord afterward. In the midst of national attacks, they fled to Hanoi, and are ready to be puppets. Now Wang X is instructing his henchmen to move around, buying up speaking organs, and advocating pro-peace rhetoric to confuse compatriots and achieve their selfish desires. Yesterday, major commercial firms in the capital suddenly received a small blue book entitled: "Collection of Recent Speeches by Vice President Wang, with Peace Opinions from Famous Scholars, Published by the Guilin International Review Agency". This booklet is obviously compiled by Wang X's claws. Their claim that it was printed in Guilin is completely deceptive. The current Guangxi can hardly tolerate the activities of Wang X's claws. Their purpose in sending it to overseas Chinese merchants is nothing more than to confuse the public and bewitch overseas Chinese. The contents of the booklet include words such as "The Vice President advocates peace talks, from the Konoe Cabinet to the Hiranuma Cabinet, the overseas Chinese leader Zhang Shuifu responds to Vice President Wang's peace proposals. Before leaving Chongqing, Mr. Zhu visited Jiang to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of peace and war. The peace movement has a general trend. Peace and war, the Vice President of the Kuomintang declared a split. The historical view of peace and war in China" and other articles, all of which are absurd and nauseating. Overseas Chinese are extremely patriotic, and they support the war of resistance and the supreme leader as always, and they will never be bewitched by Wang X's few words. Therefore, after receiving the booklet, people generally tore it up after angrily spitting and scolding. The most strange thing is that the booklet was not sent directly from Hong Kong, but from the capital, because the booklet was affixed with Siamese two-cent stamps. It is obvious that it was transported in bulk and then distributed by Wang X's party members or X-traitors here. It is extremely hateful. Overseas Chinese should pay attention to Wang X's toxic remarks and not be fooled."

The donations of overseas Chinese for national salvation have a decisive impact on the future of the motherland's war of resistance and national construction. Now Wang X and his henchmen are intensifying their efforts to bewitch overseas Chinese. We, who are in the speaking circles, cannot but solemnly point out and request serious attention to this issue, and set up concrete countermeasures.

Secondly, the reporter still has something he is compelled to say. When the reporter stayed in Hong Kong in early February, he heard rumors that the Japanese had ambitions for Annam. On February 28th, he heard a broadcast from the Japanese Tokyo Central Broadcasting Station, which said that the Annamese natives were very dissatisfied with the oppression of France and that a national independence movement was likely to occur at any time. Therefore, the reporter paid close attention to this point during his observation in Vietnam this time. It is said that X has bought over the Vietnamese, provoking the ill feelings between the Vietnamese and the French, and between the Vietnamese and the Chinese. A few weeks ago, there was a rumor that the Vietnamese were planning to massacre the Chinese, but the police discovered it and took the necessary measures to prevent it. However, two Chinese were killed in the suburbs. But the reporter did not find accurate evidence and dared not make a judgment. In addition to this, X recklessly created rumors of an attack on Vietnam, shaking people's hearts, causing the general public to store cash, which affected the French currency, which had to be diluted by one or two cents per yuan, sometimes even more than this (this phenomenon was seen in Haiphong). An attack on Vietnam is certainly an absurd rumor that is completely unfounded. However, X's poisonous methods of playing with one trick, provoking dissension, shaking people's hearts, creating terror, and disrupting finance have already been seen in reality. We believe that our friendly country, the enlightened French government, must have necessary countermeasures for all of this. We hope that our Vietnamese people will be extra careful in everything to enhance Chinese-French and Chinese-Vietnamese friendship and strengthen the power of resistance.

### Three-Nation Mutual Assistance Agreement to Be Established Soon; Britain and the Soviet Union Continue Consultations to Make Final Efforts; French-Turkish Negotiations Also Near Completion

[Central News Agency, Paris, 30th] Regarding the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, as well as the agreement between France and Turkey, responsible figures here recently declared that the countries concerned have reached a consensus in principle, with only minor issues remaining to be resolved. It is expected to be established this Friday. As for the British, French, and Soviet agreement, the Soviet Union's response to the British and French drafts still needs to go through diplomatic channels. Therefore, when People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov delivers a speech in the Soviet Parliament tomorrow, he will broadly discuss the Soviet Union's general foreign policy, and he may not provide concrete details about the three-nation agreement. As for the French-Turkish negotiations, they are also nearing completion. The current discussion regarding the Sakarya region is focused on the issue of safeguarding France's interests in that area.

[Associated Press, London, 31st] The British proposal for concluding a three-nation alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has been disclosed, stipulating that the Soviet Union will provide full assistance to Britain and France under the following circumstances: (1) When any of the three countries (Britain, France) is attacked in Europe, leading to war; (2) When Britain and France go to war due to fulfilling guarantees provided to certain countries; (3) When any European country requests assistance, and Britain and France have already implemented such assistance. Simultaneously, when the Soviet Union goes to war in Europe due to any of the above three points, Britain and France will also provide assistance. It is understood that the second article of the proposal stipulates that any assistance from any of the three countries should be in accordance with the principles of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. Furthermore, the third article of the three-nation alliance stipulates that the method of mutual assistance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should be determined through negotiations.

[Associated Press, Washington, 31st] Semi-official sources here have expressed satisfaction with the discussions regarding the establishment of a three-nation alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, stating that it is very beneficial for preventing chaos in Europe. This place has renewed interest in and attention to the Soviet Union's impending signing of the agreement, especially in light of this week's conflicts on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border. Although officials have not formally predicted changes in the situation, the general public believes that the three-nation alliance is sufficient to guarantee a long period of peace and reduce incidents during peacetime. The disruptive state of European mobilization can also be reduced, and the establishment of greater security will be as desired. "The peaceful alliance has 300 million people, and its economic, military, and naval power is extremely strong. Authoritarian countries are well aware of this situation and will be willing to implement diplomatic negotiations to resolve disputes instead of resorting to force."

[Reuters, London, 31st] Reports from London, Paris, and Moscow all unanimously hope for an early announcement of the anti-aggression agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. News from Paris states that informed sources in Paris believe that the Soviet Union will respond to the British and French proposals in the "near future." The agreement may be officially announced before the weekend. They believe that Molotov's foreign policy speech tonight will only cover general issues and will not address this agreement. Some British diplomatic reporters also have high hopes for this. Bartlett of the "News Chronicle" is the most optimistic. He listed Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky's visit to the Foreign Office yesterday and stated that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds had received new instructions from the British government, preparing to resolve the "only difficulty" before Molotov's speech. That difficulty is the Soviet Union's suspicion regarding the proposal being submitted to the League of Nations. Many people agree with Bartlett's view, requesting Britain to make a clear demonstration that this anti-aggression action will not be stopped by the League of Nations. News from Moscow states that the Soviet Union's response will be sent to the British Embassy before Molotov's speech. Sir Seeds had a long talk with Molotov on Monday night, clarifying several key points. This morning, London newspapers routinely carried other news from Moscow stating that the Soviet Union had also expressed objections to another point, namely the status of the neutrality of the Baltic Sea. They are now unwilling to accept promises of such assistance. The reporters did not explain whether this difficulty could be removed.

[Reuters, Moscow, 30th] Regarding the issue of Britain and the Soviet Union concluding an agreement, the Soviet Union's reply to the British proposal is expected to be sent to the British Embassy before Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov presents a report to the Parliament on the 31st. It is understood that British Ambassador Seeds had a meeting with Molotov on the evening of the 29th for one hour and forty-five minutes. The nature of the meeting was the exchange of opinions, and the result was the clarification of several points in the agreement proposal. French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Naggiar returned to this place today and immediately visited the British Ambassador.

[Central News Agency, London, 30th] Regarding the issue of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union concluding a mutual assistance agreement, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov believes that the drafts proposed by Britain and France, with the League of Nations Covenant as the core, are unavoidable. The British government ordered its Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, to negotiate with Molotov regarding the reason why the draft relied on the principles of the League of Nations Covenant, only wanting to explain the reasons for the establishment, but in fact, the mechanical nature of the implementation of the agreement did not diminish because of it. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Oliphant also conveyed this idea when meeting with Soviet Ambassador Maisky this afternoon.

Military Cooperation Between Countries: Britain Discusses Separately with Poland and Turkey

[Central News Agency, London, 30th] The government recently sent military experts to investigate Poland's military equipment needs. Once the government receives the report, it will consider what form of assistance to provide to Poland to complete its military expansion plan. In the view of financial figures, Poland's defense plan is deeply concerned by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and financial assistance should be provided jointly. Among them, France has already lent Poland a huge sum of more than ten million francs over the years. However, the Soviet Union has not yet taken any action, and it is generally believed that the country may not be willing to lend it the item. After the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is established, they should jointly discuss ways to assist Poland.

[Haitong Press, London, 31st] According to this morning's "Daily Express," Stanley, the Director of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, flew to Warsaw by plane on Sunday and will stay there for ten days. According to semi-official sources, this trip by Stanley is the beginning of a new friendship between Britain and Poland. According to reports, Stanley accompanied British Prime Minister Chamberlain to Germany for a return visit last September due to the Sudetenland incident and is an important figure in the British Foreign Office.

[Haitong Press, London, 31st] The Turkish military inspection team, led by General Aubé, is expected to arrive here today. It is rumored that the mission of the inspection team is to discuss military issues with the British General Staff based on the British-Turkish mutual assistance agreement.

### Troops Stationed in Western Germany Triumphantly Return Home

[Associated Press, Berlin, 31st] Five thousand German troops left Spain by ship and returned home, entering the mouth of the Ilz River last night and mooring there, waiting for General Göring's triumphal welcome. General Göring set sail this morning aboard the ship "Hamburg" to inspect the fleet at the mouth of the Ilz River.

### Hungarian General Election Results: National Socialist Party Becomes the Largest Opposition Party in the House of Representatives

[Reuters, Budapest, 30th] The results of the Hungarian general election are now mostly clear. The National Socialist Party has become the largest opposition party in the House of Representatives, increasing from no seats to twenty-five seats. The Independent Party, which was originally the largest opposition party, still supports the government party, which occupies an absolute advantage in the parliament, with a ratio of about three to one.

### Southern King and Foreign Minister Scheduled to Arrive in Berlin Today; Important Talks Conducted Behind the Scenes; Germany Will Urge Closer Ties

[Reuters, Berlin, 30th] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marko Vić will arrive here on Thursday with Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, the regent of the country. It is known that although this trip is ostensibly a state visit to Germany, important talks will actually be conducted behind the scenes. Political circles believe that Germany will urge Yugoslavia to strengthen its ties with the Axis powers. However, people from Yugoslavia here insist that strict neutrality is the country's only possible policy. If a good opportunity arises, Yugoslavia is willing to increase its trade relations with other countries, but the country's political independence will be firmly maintained.

### × Passions Boil; Konoe Will Visit Saionji to Seek Assistance

[Haitong Press, Tokyo, 31st] Privy Council President and Minister without Portfolio Konoe will visit Saionji this Saturday to discuss Japan's current domestic and foreign political issues.

[Haitong Press, Berlin, 31st] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marko Vić recently wrote an article in a publication discussing Prince Paul's visit to Germany and German-Yugoslav relations, stating that after Germany annexed Austria, it became directly adjacent to Yugoslavia, and the relationship between Germany and Yugoslavia has become closer than before. Yugoslavia's exports of agricultural products and other goods are mostly imported by Germany, and Yugoslavia's imports are also mostly from Germany. The close economic cooperation between the two countries can serve as a good foundation for cooperation in other areas. German authorities have provided assurances, expressing their continued policy of maintaining friendly relations with Yugoslavia and respecting Yugoslavia's interests. Yugoslavia has placed complete trust in this assurance, so Yugoslavia has reason to continue promoting friendly relations with Germany.

### Explorer Lander Passes Through the Netherlands to Go to the United States; Reportedly Flying to New Guinea; Great Scientific Gains

[Reuters, The Hague, Netherlands, 30th] Mr. Lander, a member of the Arkborough aviation exploration team, who previously flew to New Guinea with the team for exploration, arrived here today and is transferring to the United States. He stated that the scientific gains of the exploration team are the most important. The team encountered natives who had never seen white people and discovered several new mammals. According to reports, the exploration team consisted of six members who flew from San Diego, California, to New Guinea in June of last year, reaching their destination after flying 10,000 miles.

### British Labor Party Members Request to Have Their Party Membership Restored

[Reuters, London, 30th] British Labor Party progressive leaders Cripps, Strauss, Bevan, Young, and Bruce have recently been expelled from the Labor Party and have now decided to request to have their party membership restored. They have already notified the Labor Party Executive Committee, stating their willingness to transcribe the vows observed by all party members. Chakriots was expelled because of his attitude towards the Popular Front and because he had distributed pamphlets to various member groups advocating policies not endorsed by the national Labor Party.

### British King's Speech in Canada: Gratitude for the Warm Welcome from the People; Human Evolution Depends on Cooperation

[Reuters, Victoria, 30th] The British King attended the formal banquet of the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia and the Provincial Council today. After taking his seat, Provincial Premier Pattullo gave a welcome speech, followed by the King, who rose to express his gratitude, saying, "During this trip west, we have been warmly welcomed by the people wherever we have gone. Since landing in Quebec, the Queen and I have been extremely grateful for the loyalty and love of the Canadian people. It is an honor for anyone to be able to tour such a vast territory, and even more so to be warmly treated by men, women, and children everywhere. I fear that there are few in the world who can have this kind of experience. We will never forget it, and the encouragement we have received will be a lifelong memory for us." The King then spoke about Canada's position between Europe and Asia, saying, "With the advancement of science and the development of transportation, Canada will also become a thoroughfare connecting the two continents. One day, the world will realize that the evolution and prosperity of mankind depends on mutual cooperation, which cannot be achieved through war. The dawn of this day has already appeared, and I hope that Canada will continue to make greater efforts to promote friendly relations between East and West. As Canada's responsibility for international friendship has expanded, the benefits that mankind will enjoy will also be greater."

### Italian Undersecretary for Aviation Presents Air Force Budget; Praises the Effectiveness of Airplane Bombing

[Reuters, Rome, 30th] Italian Undersecretary for Aviation General Val, while presenting the air force budget in the Senate today, declared, "Based on our experience in Spain, we have been able to prove that the effectiveness of airplane bombing is far beyond expectations." Val also said that when Italian Prime Minister Mussolini last inspected the first squadron of the Italian Air Force in Piedmont, he had already told him that more than 80 percent of the Italian aircraft in Spain had returned to Italy. "From the battles in Barcelona and Valencia, we have gained the impression that a prosperous area can be turned into a desolate and uninhabited wasteland."

### Legal Tender of France Triumphs Over Japanese Yen: Spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance Expresses Views

[Central News Agency, Wanqing, 31st] Recently, Japanese gold notes and puppet currency in North China have both experienced sharp declines. At the same time, the puppet Huaxing Bank in Shanghai opened and issued counterfeit banknotes. At today's regular press conference, foreign journalists asked the spokesperson of our Ministry of Finance to express his views on this situation. The following answers were given separately: "The facts are obvious, so why bother adding criticism? Since you have inquired, I will reiterate the facts for your benefit. Japan attaches great importance to its gold yen, the same way it boasts its military power. Now, nearly two years into the war, although the legal exchange rate of the Japanese yen in Tokyo is still listed as one shilling and two pence, in fact, it has plummeted to seven and thirty-two elevenths of a penny in Shanghai. Roughly calculated in terms of Chinese legal tender, one hundred Japanese yen can only be exchanged for about 89 yuan of our legal tender. This is fact number one. In North China, the puppet reserve bank initially issued banknotes, hoping to steal the position of our legal tender with a currency without any reserves and backed by empty promises from Japan. Although the name of this counterfeit currency is the same as the Japanese yen in value, in fact, unless using roundabout methods, first exchanging the counterfeit currency for legal tender, and then using legal tender to purchase foreign exchange, it cannot be exchanged for any foreign currency. Moreover, since its issuance, the market price has gradually fallen. Until now, no one is willing to exchange 100 yuan of legal tender for less than 133 yuan of counterfeit currency, even the Japanese. This is fact number two. The puppet Huaxing Commercial Bank has opened in Shanghai and issued counterfeit banknotes. The Japanese exhausted their tricks to disguise it, claiming that the value of the new banknotes issued is only linked to our legal tender and can be exchanged for any legal tender. However, as soon as it appeared on the market, its true colors were exposed. Our government has not yet implemented countermeasures, and it has already shown signs of failure. The market price plummeted to the point where 160 yuan were exchanged for 100 yuan of our legal tender. As for the foreign banking community in Shanghai, no matter how the Japanese promote it, they are not lured by it and instead deny that they have accepted this counterfeit currency. This is fact number three. The above-mentioned facts are enough to make Japanese financial strategists feel discouraged. Therefore, they are racking their brains to find ways to save the situation but ultimately find nothing. One can imagine how serious this matter is for Japan. However, countries around the world are not surprised at all. Even if Japanese gold notes and various counterfeit banknotes continue to fall in value, it is inevitable and reasonable. However, this contains an important meaning. What is the meaning? It is that nearly two years into the Sino-Japanese War, Chinese legal tender has ultimately triumphed over the Japanese yen, as evidenced by this. According to Japanese propaganda, the reasons for the recent sharp decline in Japanese gold notes and various unfounded claims are as follows: (1) inflation in Japan, (2) sharp increase in prices in Japan, (3) the Sino-Japanese War has not ended, coupled with the tense situation in Europe, (4) Japan is unable to implement the original plan regarding the Huaxing Bank. In a nutshell, the decline of the Japanese gold yen is caused by Japan's own destruction of its currency system. It is obvious that Japan's finances are in difficulty, and in order to cope with the war of aggression against China, the government has long since driven the domestic Japanese print shops to frantically print public bonds. However, because society is unable to absorb this unlimited amount of bonds, gold notes are printed excessively to maintain military expenses. When necessary, the Japanese, in the war zone in our country, intend to use the manpower, financial resources, and material resources of our people. The emergence of the puppet Huaxing Bank in Shanghai, such as Japan's new financial plan, uses this bank as a pioneer, aiming to manipulate the economic organization centered on Shanghai. But at the same time, this move is enough to prove the economic difficulties Japan is in, and the increase in supplies is approaching the end. Countless amounts of inconvertible Japanese gold notes and military notes have been issued. Japan's foreign exchange reserves are almost exhausted. This kind of gold note is inherently unprepared. Moreover, once the war ends, Japan may deduct or even confiscate them. As for the worthlessness of counterfeit banknotes in North China, it is known to the world. The predicament it is currently in has completely placed Japan's North China counterfeit currency plan in a state of failure."

### Southwest Africa and South Africa Police Merge

[Reuters, Pretoria, 30th] Authorities here announced today that the Southwest African police and the South African police will merge from June 1.

### Rhine River Floods: German Defense Line Damaged; Repairs Will Take Ten Months; Rumors of Labor Strikes

[Associated Press, Paris, 31st] There have been recent rumors of labor strikes on the German Siegfried Line. The political editor of the "Radical" newspaper here declared today, "I have learned from reliable sources that the recent flooding of the Rhine River has rendered 53 kilometers of the Siegfried Line unusable. According to military experts, it will take ten months to repair this damage, which is extremely important because, in the development of diplomatic events, the leaders of the Axis powers must be tenacious about the shortcomings of the German fortifications and cannot ignore them."

Current Affairs Commentary

### Congratulations on the Establishment of the Hong Kong Branch of the Sino-British Cultural Association

The Hong Kong branch of the Sino-British Cultural Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday. The cultural circles and general residents of Hong Kong have expressed warm congratulations and great joy.

Today's China has become a champion of world peace and has stood on the front line of anti-aggression to defend democracy, peace, and global human culture. The struggle of the Chinese people for the past 22 months has been for the independence, freedom, and happiness of the Chinese nation, and it is also for the practice of the noble ideals of British people who love democracy, freedom, peace, and human culture. This point is commonly recognized by friendly countries.

At the same time, the current British people are urging the government to promote mutual assistance negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to organize an anti-aggression front. This kind of movement is necessary for today's Britain to save and defend itself, and it is also necessary to defend democratic politics, world peace, and human culture, and in reality, it can directly and indirectly help the Chinese people's ongoing war of resistance and national construction.

The improvement of friendship between the people of China and Britain and the closeness of diplomatic relations between the two countries have never been as urgently needed in history as they are today! In fact, there has never been such close cooperation as there is today! Hong Kong today occupies a very important position in promoting Sino-British diplomatic relations and strengthening the friendship and cooperation between the people of China and Britain. The residents of Hong Kong, especially the cultural circles, have an extremely important task in this regard. The important meaning of the establishment of the Hong Kong branch of the Sino-British Cultural Association lies in this, and the importance of the tasks it should undertake in the future also lies in this.

We hope that social leaders and enthusiastic members of the cultural circles from all walks of life in Hong Kong will actively participate in this branch in the future, and earnestly recognize the current status of Hong Kong, enthusiastically take on the aforementioned common tasks of the people of China and Britain today, trust each other, help each other, to enhance the friendship between the people of China and Britain, to strengthen the cooperation between the two countries, to develop the cultural and educational undertakings of Hong Kong, and to jointly build a democratic, free, and peaceful cultural fortress.

### Britain Actively Expands Navy; Sets Large-Scale Program; Countering the Shipbuilding Movement of the Axis Countries

[Haitong Press, London, 31st] This morning's Daily Telegraph published the British naval expansion program. According to the newspaper, the British government ordered 75 warships from Grant Shipyards two years ago, worth a total of £52 million. Currently, nine capital ships are under construction, including five 35,000-ton ships and four 40,000-ton ships. Recently, there has been a plan to build more capital ships, as the British government has promised the Australian government to send a fleet to be permanently stationed in the Pacific. At the same time, the construction of five "George V" class capital ships must be accelerated to balance the maritime power of various countries, as Germany, Italy, and Japan are now working hard to build new ships.

[Haitong Press, London, 31st] According to this morning's Daily Telegraph, the British Admiralty first ordered two capital ships yesterday, each with a displacement of 40,000 tons. The two new ships will be named "Lion" and "Dreadnought".

[Reuters, London, 31st] The War Office recently announced that the British Army will appoint two inspectors general, with General Ishon, the Governor of Gibraltar, as the overseas inspector general, and General Coke as the domestic military inspector general. According to reports, the British Army had the position of inspector general before the European War, but it was abolished soon after. It has now been restored, and it is slightly different from the past.

### Hong Kong University Improvement Association Suggests Central Higher Education Cooperation: Plans to Expand HKU Site and Increase Enrollment; Medical, Engineering, and Faculty in All Departments Will Be Expanded

As Sino-British relations become increasingly close, cultural communication between the two countries is especially important. Hong Kong, being close to our country, has its highest institution of learning in the University of Hong Kong. If one wants to see the flourishing of cultural endeavors between the two countries, it is easiest to start with improving HKU, so that it can connect with universities in mainland China. This can achieve twice the result with half the effort. The Hong Kong authorities, recognizing this, have established the Hong Kong University Education Improvement Committee, appointing HKU Vice-Chancellor Sir Shouson Chow as Chairman, with Colonial Secretary Mr. Smith, Financial Secretary Mr. Keen, Sir Robert Ho Tung, Secretary-General of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Mr. Li Wu, Bishop Hall, Father Cooney, Mr. Lo Min, Mr. Soley, Mr. Li Tze-fong, Professor Zen, and Professor Wright as members. Mr. Nee has been appointed as secretary, specializing in studying the following matters: (1) What subjects need and can be developed to promote cooperation in higher education between HKU and various universities in China? (2) If this development is implemented, how much personnel and expense will need to be added? (3) Study other suggestions regarding the improvement of HKU. (4) Provide suggestions on the above. The committee held its first meeting on March 14 of this year. Up to April 28, a total of thirteen meetings were held. Based on the results of the meeting discussions, a report was prepared and submitted to the Governor for review last Friday, along with a letter from the committee chairman to Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote.

Improvement Plan Requires Huge Funds

The letter stated, "I am deeply honored to submit the committee's report, which should address how to reform and develop HKU so that it not only benefits Hong Kong but also benefits Chinese people, and facilitates students from mainland China, Malaya, and the East Indies. We are well aware that the various items proposed, if fully implemented, will result in HKU's expenditure greatly exceeding its current income. Our study is not limited to how to develop within the existing financial resources of HKU. We were ordered to put forward the improvement plans that we consider necessary and effective, regardless of the amount of funds required. We feel that HKU, influenced by external environment, now has an opportunity to approach the purpose hoped for by its founders, and that if this opportunity is lost, it will be difficult to recover. Now, we have completed our mission and proposed a plan to establish places so that students from mainland China can receive maximum benefit. The plans we have put forward are for reference only and are not the final decisions. We deeply believe that without a huge amount of help to open the doors of HKU to accommodate these students, a large part of our proposed plans would be meaningless in today's HKU environment."

Sincere Cooperation with Our Authorities

The report is divided into twelve chapters. Chapter 1: Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote's address to the HKU Council on February 10, 1939. Chapter 2: List of committee members, research items, number of meetings. Chapter 3: Nature of research and recommendations. Chapter 4: Relationship between HKU and Chinese universities. Chapter 5: Students' economic difficulties. Chapter 6: Medical school. Chapter 7: Engineering school. Chapter 8: Faculty of Science. Chapter 9: Faculty of Arts. Chapter 10: Various libraries. Chapter 11: Relocation of the university and new buildings in the city. Chapter 12: Summary of recommendations and estimates. The report provides detailed research on various issues. The following is a selection of its recommendations and estimates:

The committee recommends: (1) For the sake of development, the issue of relocating the university to a larger site outside the city should be considered immediately. The new school buildings planned and proposed in this report must be completed before the university is relocated. (2) If the Chinese Ministry of Education organizes a university bureau, it can help the orderly development of Chinese university education. HKU should cooperate with this bureau. (3) A. Efforts should be made to raise funds to establish academic positions for university graduates to study medicine and public health. B. Efforts should be made to raise 28,000 yuan annually to maintain the entire scholarship plan, which is given to graduates and students of Chinese universities. C. Please ask one of the wardens of the university's affiliated dormitory to test student self-catering and use dormitories instead of one room per person to save expenses at HKU. (4) Please ask the government to provide a more suitable sports field.

Add Lectureships to the Medical and Science Faculties

(5) (A) Since Hong Kong has a new-style general hospital supply, Queen Mary Hospital can be modified into a teaching hospital. (B) Dormitories should be set up in Queen Mary Hospital in the shortest possible time for students to live in for treatment and emergency work in the hospital. (C) Within the scope possible, preparations should be made to employ as many government medical officers and private practicing doctors as possible as medical professors, and hospitals should be found for these professors. (D) A new lectureship in physical chemistry should be established to teach diagnostics. (E) In the Faculty of Science, such as in clinical medicine and pre-clinical medicine, there should be equipment for postgraduate students to study. Within each department, there should also be an assistant instructor. (6) The government and HKU should cooperate to establish a public health research institute to improve the health benefits of Hong Kong and improve the teaching of hygiene. However, the institute must be able to issue a public health diploma.

Give Subsidies to Engineering Students

(7) (A) The "degree course" in [Civil] Engineering and Electrical Engineering has been decided to be discontinued, and it has been decided to grant subsidies to students studying this subject.

Develop the academic excellence of medicine, lecturing, and degree lectures in medical electrotherapy to accommodate as many electrotherapy degree students as possible and research electrotherapy. An additional lecturer must be added. (B) Develop the honorary professor of chemistry. A microbial analysis department should be established in the chemistry department. This measure requires the establishment of a new lecturer in the biochemistry department. (C) The biology lecturer must extend the teaching to fourth-year students. This requires the addition of a lecturer and a experimental anatomy learning member, and increase the maintenance costs of books. (D) Establish a summer school for aquatic biology. This school should be held annually in the new Fisheries Research Institute and cooperate with the aquarium and other Chinese organizations. (E) Under the Department of Biology of HKU, an office should be set up in the Fisheries Research Institute to manage the supply of aquatic biological specimens.

English Department Adds Lectureships

(9) A. Establish a lectureship in English literature. This requires the addition of a Chinese lecturer in the English literature department. B. In order to study logic, ethnology, history of philosophy, and comparative Chinese and Western thought, a philosophy teaching assistant and a Chinese philosophy lecturer should also be established, in cooperation with the Sino-British Cultural Association. (C) In order to develop historical research, one lecturer and two faculty members should be added. (D) One teaching assistant and one lecturer should be added to develop geography and geology. (E) The current business department should be discontinued, and economics, politics, and law should be developed. This requires the establishment of a Chinese economics lecturer.

### After the Murder in Jiaojia Street, Police Detectives Offer Reward to Arrest Murderer: Cash Lost in Safe, Suspected of Murder for Money; Serious Case, Police Search Everywhere for Suspects

On the morning of the 30th of last month, a tragic murder case occurred at the Man Hing Lung rice store at No. 30 Jiaojia Street, Sheung Wan. The store owner, Wong Tak-kin, and his family of five were brutally murdered, resulting in the tragic deaths of four people, with only a three-day-old baby girl surviving by a thread. It is truly a cruel tragedy. After the incident, the murderer escaped without a trace, and the three store employees and a domestic helper also went missing. The police have paid close attention to this tragic tragedy and have been patrolling all major traffic arteries to strictly apprehend the bandits, but no suspects have been arrested yet. The motive for this tragedy, whether it was murder for money or a deep-seated hatred, is something that the public is eager to know.

Safe Deposit Contains No Less Than a Thousand Yuan

According to police detective news yesterday morning, no items were lost at the scene. However, an investigation by a reporter from the Hong Kong Telegraph revealed that the murderer's motive must have been murder for money. Although there were no obvious changes to the safe on the surface that night, the key to the safe was found on the bed. It was revealed that the safe contained about 1,000 Hong Kong dollars, which has now disappeared. Furthermore, Wong Chau-ming, the younger brother of the deceased, told the Telegraph reporter that it was absolutely reliable that the deceased (Wong Tak-kin) kept cash in the safe. The deceased's store business was exceptionally prosperous, and the store also stored a large amount of rice. From his personal perspective, the cash that the deceased put in the safe on Monday night was at least 1,000 yuan. According to police sources, when the safe was opened, it was found that there was nothing inside, only a few useless receipts. It is learned that the deceased's younger brother, Wong Chau-ming, manages the store affairs at Zhenglong Rice Store on Hollywood Road. Zhenglong has been in business for several years and is his father's property. Not long after Zhenglong opened, Wan Hing Lung was established at No. 30 Jiaojia Street.

Bloodstains on the Embankment Are Clearly Evident

When this tragedy occurred, Wong Chau-ming was still at Zhenglong. Later, an acquaintance knew that Wan Hing Lung had not opened by 11 a.m. and suspected something was wrong, so he informed him. When Chau-ming arrived at the scene, he knocked on the door for a long time, but no one responded. Chau-ming then realized that something had happened and reported it to the police station. When the police detectives pushed the door open, they saw that the order in the store was chaotic, but nothing was lost, and there were no signs of anyone. After careful investigation by the police detectives, bloodstains were discovered. Following the bloodstains, several corpses were found buried in the rice pile. Later, the key was found, and the key was also covered with finger marks and bloodstains, which were clearly evident. From this, it can be inferred that after the murderer committed the crime, his hands were still covered in blood, and then he grabbed the key and opened the safe.

The Murderer Was Not Caught After the Incident

Regarding the occurrence of the tragedy, the Telegraph reporter determined that it was related to murder for money. As for the reason why the murderer killed the deceased's eldest son and eldest daughter, it was to destroy the evidence of his cruelty. The police authorities believe that the occurrence of this tragedy should be urgently investigated and the murderer apprehended. A large number of police detectives have been dispatched since Monday night to search ships leaving for Australia and vehicles leaving Hong Kong for the New Territories. Suspicious pedestrians have also been strictly searched. Starting yesterday, Hong Kong has also begun searching for suspicious pedestrians. Those who are deemed suspicious are taken back to the police station for investigation. However, as of last night, the murderer has not been caught. It was also said yesterday that a suspect was arrested on a certain ship on Monday morning. The reporter believes that this case is of great concern to society and has inquired about news from various police stations, but all have stated that no suspects have been apprehended. At present, the police have offered a reward of 250 yuan to purchase and arrest the murderer and investigate the case.

### Continuous Rainfall and Shortage of Mountain Firewood, Firewood Merchants Manipulate and Raise Firewood Prices; Residents Mostly Switch to Coal to Reduce Burden, Those Who Have Not Set Up Coal Stoves Are Mostly Threatened

Since the fall of Guangzhou, transportation has been blocked, and the source of firewood has been frequently affected. Several months ago, Hong Kong suddenly experienced a firewood shortage. The authorities have repeatedly sought good methods to solve the problem. General firewood merchants have also purchased and transported large amounts of firewood from Sandakan and Singapore. The panic has gradually disappeared. However, although the price of firewood has not increased, it is still very different from what it used to be. In the past, one yuan could buy 100 catties of Sandakan firewood, but today it can only buy about 60 catties. In the past, one yuan could buy more than 80 catties of miscellaneous firewood, but today it can only buy about 50 catties. Most residents who cannot afford it try to switch to charcoal or coal. Some people also try to search for and purchase mountain firewood. Because Aberdeen and the New Territories are densely forested, many local natives secretly collect and transport firewood to the city for sale. Therefore, although firewood has been in short supply recently, residents are not in a panic because of this supplement. However, due to continuous rainfall in the past month, it has rained for twenty days within a month. Those who usually collect and sell mountain firewood have therefore ceased. Because buyers believe that the firewood has been wet by the rain and is difficult to dry, they mostly do not ask about it. Sellers also do not go to the market. Except for Sham Shui Po, where there is a large stock of firewood, some have taken this opportunity to take advantage of the opportunity to raise prices in order to monopolize the market. Most users who have not set up coal stoves have to reluctantly purchase at a high price. However, unless they have to, they only try to find and purchase mountain firewood for future use. This is ultimately the result of some firewood merchants' pursuit of profit, but it does not have much impact on the normal market situation.

### "Marriage" in Hong Kong

— Yu Lang

Marriage in Hong Kong takes many forms, including old-fashioned weddings with sedan chairs, "civilized weddings" with cars, religious weddings, and "signing at the court" registration weddings. I will explain them one by one.

Old-fashioned weddings have three parts: "engagement," "betrothal" (commonly known as "passing the great gifts"), and "welcoming the bride." "Engagement" is the engagement ceremony. The time it is held from the wedding date varies. Some people get engaged one or two years before the wedding, while others get engaged one or two weeks before the wedding.

The "engagement" ceremony involves the groom's family preparing gifts such as wedding cakes, pigs, wine, fruits, betel nuts, and green (tea) and one or two pieces of gold jewelry to send to the bride's family. The bride's family then returns gifts such as clothing, jewelry, "tea feet," and ginger, lotus root, taro, etc., which are considered "auspicious." The amount of gifts depends on the wealth of the families.

The "tea feet" mentioned above is a kind of "term," which includes fried glutinous rice cakes, steamed sponge cakes, "big hair" (a kind of cake), steamed buns, candy cakes, and fried foods.

"Passing the great gifts" is the most solemn ceremony of sending gifts. The number of gifts from both the groom's and bride's families varies depending on local customs. For example, a certain number of dan of shortcakes, a certain number of jars of wine, a certain number of dan of pigs, a certain number of Beijing fruit, a certain number of dried seafood, a certain number of fresh fruit, a certain number of foreign wine... must all be presented in full. If there are any shortages, there will inevitably be quarrels, and the "in-laws may become enemies."

There are many kinds of wedding cakes. Those that belong to shortcakes include: red satin, white satin, yellow satin, roasted chicken, preserved eggs... Other cakes include dragon and phoenix cakes, walnut cakes, sponge cakes... The cheapest costs twenty yuan per dan, and the expensive costs more than forty yuan per dan. The prices of foreign wine and dried seafood "vary at different times."

Wedding cakes and fruits are all loaded in round cake basins, placed on food boxes, and carried by coolies in a mighty procession to the bride's home.

The "birth date" gift book, gold bracelets, rings, and all valuable jewelry, and the "bride price" are still the main things in the betrothal. However, wealthy families usually do not pay much attention to the amount of the bride price because they are afraid that people will laugh at them for "selling their daughters." They just accept whatever the groom's family gives. Some do not even accept it. Economics is the main force in overthrowing the old etiquette. In recent years, in order to save "labor fees," many people have used cargo trucks to transport gifts.

After receiving the gifts, the bride's family also returns gifts such as "tea feet," cloth for gowns, shoes, hats... Books are of course the main item.

"Great gifts" are usually followed by a wedding within three, five, or seven days. On the eve of the wedding, the bride's family will move the "dowry" to the groom's house. The amount of dowry depends on the wealth of the family. Usually, it includes furniture, bedding, clothes... Wealthy people have to "parade the dowry," with a "dowry list" that is several inches thick, including "living room" furniture made of rosewood and sandalwood, sofas, dining tables, mahjong tables, silverware, tinware, dressing tables in the room, small sofas, duck down quilts, velvet blankets, all kinds of odds and ends, jewelry and gold ornaments, all the way down to chamber pots, carrying poles, wood axes, fire tongs, and even salted fish and preserved vegetables. The entire procession is led by musicians and takes half an hour to pass on the road.

On the day of "welcoming the bride," the sedan chair is the main thing. The rental value of sedan chairs varies greatly depending on the grade. The cheapest red satin sedan chair costs five or six yuan, the green sedan chair costs six or seven yuan, but the top-of-the-line electric light green sedan chair costs ten to twenty yuan. If you want the eight sedan chair coolies to wear red uniforms, each one will cost an additional yuan in wages.

In addition to the sedan chair, the ceremonial guard used varies depending on wealth. The simple one only uses a sedan chair, a pair of lanterns, and a group of "marching band," which is called "four blows and six lifts" (that is, four people playing drums and music, and six people carrying the sedan chair).

The wealthy ones use more "great music," and the lanterns must be more than two pairs. The cost of "sugar mountains," "firecrackers," green pavilions, stupid lanterns, parasols, and treasure fans... is not less than one or two hundred yuan.

The even wealthier ones put on a show like a parade, with "horses," "floating colors," employing girls dressed as ancient people riding horses in front, and other girls dressed as palace maids to hold up scenes such as "Heavenly Maiden Sending Son" and "Meeting in the Milky Way," which are carried by people: green pavilions, double greens, single stupid lanterns, soft greens, all kinds of colors, loud blowing and beating, the ceremonial guard extends for miles, and pedestrians stand by the roadside to watch. It takes an hour to see it all.

In addition to the three parts mentioned above, there are other things such as "crowning the bride," the bride's parents greeting the ancestors in the hall on the third day, and sending a roast pig back to her own family on the third day... The cumbersome formalities would make a book if written out.

Hosting a banquet is also a major event. The groom's family strives to hold a "light meal on the first day" and a "plum meal the next day," hosting a grand banquet for relatives and friends for two days. The bride's family must also host a grand "joyful meal."

"Civilized weddings" are a wedding ceremony that saves trouble and money, born out of the decline of feudal society and the collapse of capitalist society.

The simple one only uses a car, tied with a floral sign that says "So-and-so Family Welcomes the Bride," and drives from the groom's home to the bride's home to bring the bride back, which is considered the completion of the wedding ceremony. At most, a few tables of wine are set up in the evening to entertain relatives and friends. A set of plays involving the wedding officiant giving a speech, the host giving a speech, the guests giving speeches, exchanging rings, issuing marriage certificates, tea parties, passports... The wealthier ones will open champagne and dance the tango. Among the guests, some wear long gowns and mandarin jackets, some wear floral dresses and gowns, some wear tailcoats and soft silk dresses. People and things are a combination of Chinese and Western styles. The foreign orchestra also plays the "Wedding March" loudly.

Speaking of wedding halls and tea parties, mid-to-upper-class hotels charge 20 yuan for renting the hall, and the tea and snacks cost 70 cents per guest. High-end hotels do not charge for renting the hall, but the tea and snacks cost one yuan per guest. Champagne, orchestra, and fresh flower decorations are charged separately.

Although many people wear long gowns and mandarin jackets at civilized weddings, some even wear ill-fitting Western suits and hunting outfits, while others wear tailcoats and top hats. It is very expensive to make this kind of formal attire. Foreign tailors charge no less than two or three hundred yuan, while Chinese tailors charge more than one hundred yuan. Fortunately, there are many stores that "rent wedding attire." The daily rental price for a tailcoat, top hat, shirt, and all accessories is only thirteen or fourteen yuan. The daily rental price for the bride's white satin dress, veil, and gloves is only seven or eight yuan.

Religious weddings are held in churches. There are more than 30 Catholic and Protestant churches in Hong Kong and Kowloon that are licensed to issue marriage certificates. After they perform a wedding ceremony for people, they are required to report to the government marriage registry for record.

Religious weddings are similar to civilized weddings, except that the ceremony is presided over by a pastor or priest.

Religious weddings also cost money. Ringing the wedding bells costs 25 yuan.

Registration weddings, where you "sign at the court," are very simple. You only need to register with the registry, and the registrar will announce the names, addresses, and occupations of the bride and groom at the high court marriage registry. You can get married two weeks later. The registration fee is only one yuan. If you are in a hurry, you can apply for a special permit and get married at any time, but the special permit costs 50 yuan.

Holding a wedding at the registry costs ten yuan. The ceremony only involves the registrar, the groom, the bride, and two witnesses signing the marriage certificate.

Although things are so simple, some people often hold a tea party and dance at a hotel hall after registering at the registry, and then hold a grand banquet for guests at a restaurant in the evening.

In addition to the various forms mentioned above, "group weddings" have also been organized by youth associations, and the results have been good. Later, after the "July 7th Incident" occurred, they thought that the national crisis was serious, so they stopped holding them. However, I don't know that the number of marriages in Hong Kong has actually increased from last year to now. (Tomorrow: Funerals in Hong Kong)

Life Insurance Theory

### Life Insurance and the Value of Life

— Wang Yunyu

What is life insurance?

Life insurance is a method of preparing funds to compensate contributors for economic losses incurred due to death, disability, and old age. From a general social perspective, life insurance is a social strategy for accumulating funds to compensate for losses due to death, where the responsibility for such risks is transferred from individuals or a small number of people to the collective responsibility of the public. From a general individual perspective, life insurance is a contract in which one party, the insured, pays a certain premium, and the other party, the insurance company, compensates the insured or their designated beneficiary with the insured amount upon death or the occurrence of a specified event.

What is the value of life?

The values in the world can be broadly divided into two types: property value and life value. Property value is tangible, such as houses, land, goods, etc., which belong to material objects and can visibly demonstrate their value. Life value, on the other hand, is intangible, such as an individual's skills, knowledge, character, etc., which belong to human affairs, and its value is invisible. Life value is the element that creates property value; without life value, there is no property value. Therefore, life value is actually more important than property value. For example, if a house is burned down, it can certainly cause inconvenience and hardship to the homeowner and their family; however, if the person continues to live and can work, the loss can soon be compensated for, and the house can be rebuilt. Conversely, if the house is not burned down, but the homeowner dies, their productive capacity is lost forever. Moreover, the loss of life is inevitable sooner or later, while the loss of property may never occur, or the time of occurrence may be very distant. Life value, as expressed by our usual earning capacity, is a kind of asset, no different from actual property. However, people are often unaware of this and only recognize the value of property. Therefore, they take property insurance for granted, such as insuring houses, machines, ships, cars, and goods against fire or water damage to protect them. If they encounter dangers such as fire or water and suffer losses, they can obtain compensation from the insurance company. However, they often neglect the supreme value of life and do not think of protecting it and compensating for its loss, which shows a lack of understanding of the function of life insurance.

Life Insurance's Protection of Life Value

Life insurance aims to deal with the economic value of human life. Property faces the danger of water and fire damage, and is insured against water or fire to provide protection. Similarly, the value of human life is also constantly destroyed by the danger of death, and should be insured with life insurance to provide protection, so that the dependents of the insured are not left destitute due to the loss of the insured's productive capacity and suffer economic hardship. Therefore, the greatest purpose of life insurance is to protect the insured's life from the danger of complete or permanent loss of productive capacity due to physical destruction. These dangers can be considered economic death. The following three dangers are the causes of economic death:

(1) Premature death in adulthood

(2) Physical disability

(3) Old age without support

Premature death in adulthood refers to death during one's productive years. The economic importance of this danger is more serious than the danger of property encountering water or fire. And the value of human life, at any time, has the possibility of facing this danger. Physical disability and old age without support, although life still exists, the ability to work has been eliminated, and there is no production, only continued consumption. Therefore, although alive, it is as good as dead.

The seriousness of the above three dangers requires a form of protection to prevent and address them. Life insurance is the only and most appropriate way to protect against these dangers. If we have life insurance, then if we die prematurely during our productive years, the life insurance can serve as the family's future estate, so that dependents are not left in poverty. If we retire in old age and the insured still lives without worry, the life insurance can serve as our own savings for old age. Also, if the insured encounters total disability, there is a considerable income, and they are exempt from continuing to pay premiums thereafter, and the insurance contract remains valid until death, serving as the family's livelihood after death.

Valuation of Life Value and Sum Insured

The fact that the value of life is higher than the value of property and the importance of life insurance in protecting the value of life have been discussed above. Now, let us discuss the valuation of life value and the amount of insurance that should be taken out. Since life value is the capitalization of productive capacity, it is a kind of asset, just like property. Now that the valuation of asset value has become a common phenomenon, it is only natural to treat the larger value of life in the same way. According to the opinions of many scholars, it is believed that the amount of insurance for a family must be based on the income from the principal usually invested, which is sufficient to support the family in the way they lived before the insured's death, excluding the part attributable to the insured himself. For example, if the insured's annual expenditure is six thousand yuan, half of which, that is, three thousand yuan, is used to support the family, then calculated at an annual interest rate of five percent, the principal should be sixty thousand yuan. In other words, one should take out sixty thousand yuan of insurance, so that there can continue to be an income of three thousand yuan per year to serve as the family's support.

This plan is a good general rule for supporting one's family after death, but the size of each family is different, the income is different, and the protection that they rely on from the head of the household's insurance also varies. The number of children who have not reached the age of independence, the existence of dependents who are unable to support themselves, the need for educational funds, and the amount and nature of other investments are all conditions for determining the amount of insurance. In short, the economic happiness of the family is the primary issue that the head of the household should plan for. If we do not use life insurance to provide adequate protection, then for this greatest economic danger facing us, it is no different from taking risks and hoping for luck, which is extremely unwise. As the world-renowned life insurance expert, S. S. Huebner, said: "A householder who does not have substantial property and does not take out life insurance to protect his dependents from the pain of losing his own productive capacity is committing an act that is not far from a crime."

Life Insurance Issues

### Suicide and the Responsibility of Life Insurance Companies

— Kong Dian

Death insurance within insurance uses the death of the insured as a condition for the insurance company to pay compensation. In other words, the beneficiary designated in the insurance policy can only receive compensation from the life insurance company after the insured's death. However, there are many ways to die. If the cause of death is the beneficiary's murder, and the law still allows them to have the right to receive compensation, then not only will the insured always be worried about the danger of life, but the impact of this will make society regard life insurance as a fearful path, and hesitate to move forward. Therefore, if the beneficiary intentionally causes the death of the insured, not only should they be severely punished for the crime of murder under criminal law, but they should also not be allowed to receive compensation under insurance law.

However, if the cause of the insured's death is not due to homicide, but suicide, what is the responsibility of the life insurance company at this time? There is a need for in-depth research.

Suicide is an act of intentionally harming oneself with the aim of extinguishing one's own life. If the purpose is not to harm life, even if the result of the act is sufficient to create a danger of death, it cannot be called suicide. Therefore, the requirement for suicide is that it must be based on the existence of intention. If there is no intention to commit suicide, and death occurs due to accidental negligence, such as a pharmacist dying from testing poisons, or an aviator dying from a practice accident, it cannot be regarded as suicide. Similarly, death caused by loss of mind and reason cannot be called suicide.

The occurrence of suicide can be accidental, or it can be accumulated for a long time and suddenly occur one day. The motives can be sadness about the times and one's own circumstances, excessive sorrow, or shame and guilt, to avoid mental suffering. Regardless of the cause, as long as it is based on one's own intention, it can be called suicide. As for those who are temporarily mentally impaired, or driven by impulsive chivalry, such as excessive intoxication, misusing machinery, a child falling into a well, or jumping into water to shake off something, resulting in unfortunate sacrifice of life, if it is not intentional, it is not suicide.

Although the causes of death in suicide and homicide are completely different, the result is the same. Therefore, according to Article 66 of our country's Insurance Law, insurance companies can be exempted from the responsibility of paying compensation.

However, it does not seem appropriate to allow life insurance companies to be exempted from paying compensation regardless of whether the cause of suicide is intentional or not. Therefore, our country's Insurance Law only stipulates that insurance companies can claim exemption from liability for intentional suicide. The reason for this is that it is feared that the insured, due to business bankruptcy or a major shock, will intend to commit suicide, but also worry that after death, his wife and children will be cold and hungry, and their lives will be unsupported. Therefore, they specifically enter into a whole life insurance contract with the insurance company in advance, as a plan for the safety of their family. From this, it can be seen that the insured has already had the intention of committing suicide. To protect their own interests, insurance companies can, of course, insert a clause in the insurance policy stating that they are not liable for compensation if suicide occurs within a certain period after the contract is signed. However, although the insured intends to commit suicide, there is no reason for the intention of suicide to remain unchanged for a long time. Therefore, Article 60, paragraph 2 of our country's Insurance Law also stipulates that if the insurance contract has been in effect for more than two years (the British Insurance Law stipulates one year), and the insured dies due to suicide, the insurance company is still responsible for paying compensation.

Although insurance companies can be exempted from paying compensation for the suicide of the insured, the calculation of insurance premiums is based on the principle of level premium, that is, the insured pays the same amount of premium each year from the beginning to the end of the contract period. The amount paid when signing the contract actually exceeds the amount that should be paid based on the insured's actual age. This excess portion of the insurance premium accumulation is originally the amount prepaid by the insured, and is their rightful right. Therefore, although the insurance contract resulting from suicide is invalid, the proviso in Article 66, paragraph 1 of the Insurance Law specifically stipulates that the insurance premium accumulation must still be returned to the insured.

### Constipation and Disease

— Li Haotian

Constipation is the result of bad habits. It occurs more frequently among people living in cities than other diseases, hence it is called a "disease of civilization." Constipation is the origin of all diseases and can affect the health of all organs in the body. Fortunately, today, the intelligentsia mostly understands that it is a pest that harms the body.

The habit of constipation often forms in early years. Unskilled mothers often unintentionally cause their children to develop this bad habit. Mothers, being busy dealing with their children's natural demands, often make them forcibly suppress the urge to defecate. So, when they enter school, they dare not ask for a short break to go out. When they have grown up, due to social environments, long-distance travel, or being too busy with official business, they need to forcibly suppress the urge to defecate. All of these are the origins of the habit of constipation.

The most ideal routine is for us to eat three times a day and defecate once. Bad habits can cause people to develop physiological abnormalities. Hunger makes one think of food, and fatigue makes one think of sleep; this is habit. Eating and sleeping irregularly can cause stomach problems and insomnia. The best way to treat them is not to seek help from medicine, but to seek early sleep and regular meals. From this, it can be seen that to cure constipation, the same principle applies; one should use good habits to cure bad habits. Nature allows people to reap what they sow. Is constipation a bad habit?

The result of constipation: the rectum is the collection point of residual substances in the body, and poisonous gases are produced from it. The undigested water is often absorbed into the blood from here, resulting in the following symptoms: headache, dizziness, vomiting, stomach pain, loss of appetite, etc. As for the occurrence of diseases, there are the following: influenza, arthritis, neuritis, tonsillitis, vascular diseases, and more. Poor food choices can also cause constipation, and white rice, which lacks Vitamin B, is not suitable for consumption. Vitamin B is an essential element for nourishing nerves. Once it disappears or decreases, the peristalsis of the stomach and intestines decreases, and the strength of the stomach and intestines weakens. Self-treatment of constipation: (1) Choice of foods, such as vegetables, millet, fruits, are mostly mild laxatives. (2) Drinking plenty of water is a good way to prevent constipation. Drink eight to ten cups a day, or chop two or three cups before each breakfast. However, this habit should be gradually developed, starting with cold boiled water. (Note that drinking water during meals is not very suitable). (3) Medicines should not be taken regularly, but if you have suffered from constipation for a long time, taking them occasionally is also permissible. Purgatives and other stimulant laxatives should not be taken too often. Mineral oil is safer. Rectal enemas are difficult to perform often, but when constipation has been too long, they can also be performed occasionally. (4) Exercise can strengthen muscles, such as playing ball, walking, riding, etc.

### Don't Worry About Having No Confidants Ahead; Who Doesn't Know You in the World of Football? South China Team Embarks on a Journey; Yesterday a Group of Nineteen People Sailed South on the Guangdong; Tan Zhenhui and Jiang Gan's Farewell Suddenly Turned into a Traveler

(Special Report from This Newspaper) "A boat full of parting sorrow, wind and rain send off the traveler." A different kind of taste in my heart.

Yesterday morning, it was drizzling continuously. The South China Southern Expedition football team, which had changed its departure date several times, finally set off towards the south at 4:00 PM yesterday, braving the wind and waves.

The selected team for this expedition, after careful consideration by Coach Mo Qing, consisted of twenty heroes.

At 2:30 PM, those who braved the rain to rush to Queen's Pier to see them off included the players' family members and friends, as well as many association officials. However, when I looked at the farewell team, I noticed that "Uncle Lu" was missing. This old man has always been enthusiastic. Every time South China goes on an expedition, he is always there to send them off and welcome them back. But this time, it was an exception.

I didn't hear the shouts of "Come on South China." I don't know what the players thought. I heard that this old man was a little unhappy because his son was accompanying the team without him.

"Fatty" Zhou, the association official, arrived late. After checking the list of those accompanying the team, Coach Mo hurried over, looking left and right, busy as could be.

After being dropped, Tan Zhenhui deeply sighed that he had no chance. Yesterday, he quietly mingled in the crowd of well-wishers, not saying a word, which was truly sad. However, "Heaven never bars all roads to a man." Zhou Fatty suddenly received a confidential instruction from Coach Mo and temporarily allowed Zhenhui to accompany the team. This made him laugh and cry.

Zhenhui said to me, "Coach Mo is truly unpredictable. I am now embarking on the journey empty-handed, without even underwear. It's really embarrassing."

Li Dianyou's "suspension" has not yet expired, so he couldn't go and could only welcome people for a short distance. But when the general send-off party left the "Guangdong" ship, Shuo You did not move, but remained on the ship. It is conceivable that this would touch him.

Zhuo Shijin's "family" came with Shijin's sister to see him off. Their reluctant farewell attracted attention. It was truly a feeling of, "I wish to plant willows along the riverbank, hoping to keep my beloved here."

On the small boat, Shijin said to me, "Today the waves are so big. The Guangdong is not a giant ocean liner. Once out at sea, it will inevitably suffer from seasickness." His wife heard this and secretly glanced at him, a little concerned.

I joked with Guo Yingqi, asking him, "How many bowls of rice will you eat on this southern tour?" He said, "I can't do it now. My stomach still hurts slightly. My appetite is not as good as before."

Feng "Two Years Old" drove the small boat and stepped onto the deck of the Guangdong, only to find that he had left behind a small leather bag. Before long, Xie Jinhong brought it over and returned the item to its owner. Uncle Two, out of gratitude, said he would give him at least one yuan for tea, but in the end, Uncle Two said he couldn't do it.

Liang Rongzhao was too busy with affairs and hadn't finished them yet, so he couldn't leave at the same time. He had to travel alone in a few days.

Mai Shaohan's foot was injured and he still needed to rest. He would wait for the main force to arrive in Singapore before rushing to rejoin the team. Li Huitang had also not yet accompanied the team.

Therefore, yesterday, only the team leader Mo Qing, official Zhou Runnian, and players Bao Jiaping, Zhang Rongcai, Li Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng, Li Guowei, Guo Yingqi, Liu Qingcai, Liu Songsheng, Yang Genbao, Tan Zhenhui, Deng Guangsen, Yang Shuiyi, Feng Jingxiang, Li Zhaorong, Chen Dehui, Zhuo Shijin, and Luo Douwen, a total of nineteen people, departed.

Coach Mo said, "This itinerary will first go to Haiphong, then to Hanoi, Hue, Saigon, the Malay Archipelago, Kuala Lumpur, Johor, Singapore, Malacca, Selangor, Perak, Penang, Myanmar, Yangon, Sumatra, Medan, the Dutch East Indies Batavia, Semarang, Surabaya, and then return to Hong Kong via Manila, which will take about four months. We will rush back in mid-September to participate in the next season's football league."

Farewell, travelers, "Don't worry about having no confidants ahead; who doesn't know you in the world of football?" Let's wait until the cool autumn in September to meet again. But I wish you a safe journey and "powerful legs."

On our way back, in the vast misty waters, we watched the giant Guangdong postal ship, gradually moving away from us until it disappeared.

Football Department Director Hao Tianlifa invited us to step onto Suolingge, a cup in hand, washing away the sorrow of parting.

### South China Athletic Association Resumes Holding Summer Friendly Football Tournament: Registration Begins Today, Deadline on the 15th

[Our Newspaper Exclusive] The South China Athletic Association, considering that the official Hong Kong football league has already concluded, has decided to organize a friendly football tournament during this long summer to train up-and-coming talents and provide its members with the opportunity to participate in football activities. It is noted that the Association had already held the first and second summer friendly football tournaments in 1919 and 1920. At that time, the Association was still small in scale, and membership was limited, with only four teams participating. However, the competition was already quite fierce. Now, Liu Qingxiang, Chen Guangyao, Ye Jiugao, Chen Su, Guo Baogen, Hong Renzhou, and others, who have broken free from the playing field and are renowned as famous players, all had their start at that time. Back then, South China did not yet have the Caroline Hill pitch, so all matches were held at the So Kon Po grounds. In 1921, plans were made to continue with the third tournament, but unfortunately, due to issues with the pitch, it could not be realized. Some years ago, when Lin Zhonghao was in charge of the football department, there was also a proposal to continue with a summer friendly football tournament to nurture talent. However, at that time, the Caroline Hill pitch was in urgent need of repair and the turf was being re-laid, and there was no suitable alternative pitch to borrow. Thus, the proposal to continue the tournament ultimately did not come to fruition. This year, the Association's football committee, recognizing that many members desire the opportunity to play football and also planning to organize training classes to practice formal football skills, felt that although borrowing a pitch might present some problems, for the sake of cultivating football talent and giving newcomers the opportunity to learn, it decided to continue the tournament. It also resolved to establish a Summer Friendly Football Tournament Committee to be solely responsible for its management. Many veteran football players were invited to provide sponsorship. Registration begins today, and the deadline is the 15th of the same month. In the future, after the tournament, those with better skills and diligent participation in the competition will be selected to form a training class and be trained by veteran players, with the aim of cultivating outstanding talent to serve the Association. Given the large membership of the Association, it is expected that a considerable number of people will participate, and the emergence of new talent can be predicted. The regulations of the tournament are appended below:

(1) Objective: The objective of this tournament is to cultivate football talent, foster camaraderie, and strengthen physical fitness.

(2) Eligibility: All male members of the Association who are interested in studying the art of football may register to participate.

(3) Team Formation: After members join, the committee will assign teams and team captains, with each team having 13 players. Once the teams are formed, they are final and no changes will be allowed. Players must faithfully serve their team to align with the Association's intention to train team members.

(4) System: If seven or more teams join the tournament, an elimination system will be used first. Once four teams remain, a single round-robin system will be used. If the number of participants is only sufficient to form seven teams, then the entire tournament will use a single round-robin system.

(5) Rules: The rules of the match will be in accordance with the existing competition rules established in Hong Kong.

(6) Referee: The referees for each match will be appointed by the Association. All players must absolutely obey their authority to execute all judgments.

(7) Disputes: In the event of a dispute during the match, the referee has the right to make a decision. If the participating team is still dissatisfied, the team captain must appeal to the tournament committee within 48 hours, which will then be judged by the committee.

(8) Postponement: Once the competition schedule has been determined, no team may request a postponement under any circumstances, regardless of any unexpected events encountered. However, this does not apply in the event of rain or wind. The date of the make-up match will be determined by the committee.

(9) Time: All matches are scheduled to be held every Saturday and Sunday. After the order of play is determined, it will be sent to each team member, one copy per person. Please arrive on time to participate in the match. No further notices will be sent. If less than eight players arrive within fifteen minutes of the scheduled time, the team will be deemed unable to form a team and will be considered to have lost. If both sides lack the required number of players, both will be deemed to have lost.

(10) Location: All matches will be held at the Association's Caroline Hill pitch.

(11) Scoring: For each match, the winner will receive two points, each team will receive one point for a draw, and the loser will receive zero points. The team with the most points will be the champion, and the next will be the runner-up.

(12) Awards: The tournament will prepare an embroidered flag with the names of the champion team members embroidered on it. A photo will also be taken and kept in the Association's collection for display in perpetuity. In addition, individual prizes will be awarded to football players for their applicable items to encourage them.

(13) Registration: Registration begins on June 1st and closes at 6:00 PM on June 15th. Registration forms must be filled out clearly in accordance with the Association's registration form.

(14) Fees: Each registration fee is 50 cents, and the Association will provide a uniform in return.

(15) Addendum: If there are any shortcomings in these regulations, the tournament committee may convene a meeting at any time to add or delete them. After the regulations have been amended, all team members should be notified and implemented three days later.

"Note": The committee also decided that after the end of the tournament, it will select players who are keen to compete and have commendable football skills to form a football training class, and will hire veteran football players to serve as instructors, regularly practicing to cultivate outstanding talents in order to fulfill the purpose of promotion. All our members who are interested in joining the group should pay attention.

### Koichiro Tanabe's Guo Moruo

— Wheat Ear

Japanese writers or critics' articles describing foreign writers all contain the poisonous idea of Japanism. This is the arrogance and shamelessness of their so-called "bushido spirit." The spread of this germ in the Japanese literary world is the regressive behavior of Japanese fascist literary figures. Koichiro Tanabe's "Guo Moruo" in the May issue of the Japanese Review is an article containing this germ. Tanabe's praise of "Eastern culture" and "Eastern peace" is in the same tone as the Japanese fascist warlords.

The article is divided into four sections to describe Guo Moruo's life. It begins by saying:

"Guo Moruo is the giant of the Chinese literary world after Lu Xun's death. Among the new Chinese youth, he is revered as the second Lu Xun."

This expresses respect for Guo Moruo, but then he goes on to say:

"I originally did not know Guo Moruo personally. As a humanitarian of the Orient, I have secretly made profound and interesting observations on his attitude under the tragedy of this unavoidable incident, for the sake of his being a literary and intellectual figure. Why? Because of the differences between nationalities, in terms of patriotic sentiments and the ideals of human justice that transcend ethnicity and self-interest, if we were the same as Guo Moruo, in the occurrence of this unavoidable Sino-Japanese tragedy, "Eastern peace" is established on "national coexistence," and we must mutually have the will to stand up."

The so-called will here is in the same vein as the regressive behavior of Japanese fascist warlords. Tanabe further indicates that he does not ask whether Wang Jingwei consciously acknowledged the possibility of a Sino-Japanese cooperative body under the incident and threw himself into the anti-Japanese camp? "I am truly puzzled by Guo Moruo." Our war of resistance is for the independence of the nation, and the Japanese fascist warlords are driving the Japanese people to the battlefield to taste gunpowder, all to create their own class status. This violent behavior is not only the great enemy of the Chinese people but also the enemy of the Japanese people. For the sake of human justice and peace, we should unite to overthrow the common enemy—the Japanese warlords. Except for traitors and running dogs who are willing to act perversely, I think all peace-loving people in the world oppose this arrogant behavior of the Japanese warlords. Tanabe has no such understanding and instead blows his own horn for the warlords. How shameless!

However, Tanabe also quotes the following poem:

"Again, it is time to throw down the pen and volunteer for the army, bidding farewell to my wife and severing the lotus root threads. Tears of blood for more than ten years away from the country, boarding the ship and seeing the banners for three nights. Gladly bury my remaining bones in China; crying out my sincerity to compose this poem. Four hundred million people rush forward, with one heart and one mind, wearing the same uniform."

He praises this poem on his knees: "It is a magnificent poem of a patriotic person. The Japanese spirit of Bushido praises this magnificent heart while knocking on the side of the boat... His integrity to his motherland is something that any Japanese can agree with."

In this light, the Japanese spirit of Bushido has completely gone bankrupt. How much are the Japanese warlords trembling at our resistance!

In the second section of the article, he says:

"Guo Moruo and Yu Dafu are both giants in the Chinese literary world, but Yu Dafu is purely a writer, while Guo Moruo is not only a writer but also a thinker and even more so a scholar. When he was in exile in Japan, his research on ancient Chinese history and the study of inscriptions on bronze and oracle bone characters will become immortal achievements."

He also says: "From what position does Guo Moruo stand as a thinker? Although he participated in the National Revolution at the same time as the Soviet adviser Borodin, his words and actions, when spoken about communism, are better described as democratic humanism, and extremely oriental humanism. He, like Lu Xun, is a humanitarian of the Orient. He is a politician, only a poet in essence; he is a poet, but also a zealous, most simple-minded scholar of the Three Principles of the People."

This analysis also inevitably falls into the narrowness of Japanese fascists and does not have a sincere understanding of Guo Moruo's most glorious stance of fighting for national liberation. The so-called democratic humanism and extremely oriental humanism are nothing more than a cover for the army's praise of "Oriental culture" and "Oriental peace."

In the third section of the article, he provides the most detailed description of Guo's works and wants to depict his life and image through Guo's works. He says:

"As a literary figure, Guo Moruo has works describing his childhood life, "My Childhood," the youthful period "Black Cat," the "Fallen Leaves" depicting love with Japanese girls during his study in Japan, and the "Drifting Trilogy" depicting his life in Fukuoka after marriage! and "Ten Years of Creation" and "Northern Expedition" of the Creation Society era. These are all representative of his works."

Regarding "Black Cat," he commented: "The novel 'Black Cat' has scenes of tearful grief, just as Pushkin's famous work 'Broski' has a romantic beauty."

He commented on "Fallen Leaves" by saying, "The novel 'Fallen Leaves' is a depiction of the international love of Guo Moruo and his wife's youth, on par with Goethe's 'The Sorrows of Young Werther.' As a canon of youth, it depicts the hearts of modern Chinese young men and women."

Tanabe praises Guo Moruo's works, but he only praises them from the perspective of a free-minded person and a literary figure. He does not understand that Guo's works reflect Guo's life, nor does he understand that Guo's works are a description of the Chinese liberation struggle. In this section Qin, Tanabe only adheres to the idea of Japanism and does not extend to a perspective for human justice and anti-warlordism. It can be said that this is a consistent, inferior character as a Japanese writer.

In the fourth section, Tanabe reveals his ferocious face even more. He stubbornly supports Oriental culture and is full of the anti-European and anti-foreign ideas of the Japanese warlords. He makes the following judgment on Guo Moruo's recent actions:

"Guo Moruo only escaped from Japan for the sake of the fate of the 400 million people and the motherland. Now, to save the motherland and the 400 million people, and to establish the ideal of the Orient, advocating "Oriental peace" I think it is a great mission for Guo Moruo and others!"

What a shameless joke. The so-called "saving China and the 400 million people" is that we are striving for freedom under the invasion of Japanese fascist warlords. We must adhere to a protracted war and the final victory. Now, Japan has suffered serious resistance from our country and is collapsing day by day. The road to their destruction is right before their eyes. Tanabe, this kind of Japanese writer, guides the warlords to say "Oriental peace" and "East Asian Cooperative Body." This kind of self-deceiving madness simply loses the writer's conscience. As Mr. Guo Moruo said in "The Chinese Are Indeed Geniuses":

"The Chinese are indeed geniuses, and the Japanese who generally harbor ill intentions towards China are jealous of us and try their best to hinder our development. But we must not be discouraged at all, and we must not be complacent either... Let everyone make a determination and work hard."

This passage is indeed a powerful blow to Japanese fascist literary scholars. The Japanese fascists who are jealous of us will only see their efforts pushing them further into decline. Judging from Tanabe's "Guo Moruo," it not only shows the decline of the Japanese fascist literary world but also indicates the demise of the Japanese fascist warlords!

### Underground Fire

— Star

Some people are afraid of fire, especially birds and animals. When they see fire, if they cannot extinguish it, they can only flee quickly to avoid being burned to death. If they can extinguish it, they are certainly willing to do everything in their power to eliminate it.

Fire originally comes from heaven, but to avoid the destruction of those who fear it, it will go underground. Thus, the fire we see today is hiding underground, temporarily stopping the scene of blazing flames and burning all filth in the world. The triumph of the destroyer is naturally imaginable.

Originally, fire is lively, clever, and also intense. The Holy Spirit of God is also represented by it. It is unwilling to be easily sacrificed under the foul arts of the destroyers. It can temporarily reduce its flames, and it can slightly restrain its angry steps. If it is forced too hard, it can hide deep underground.

Underground, it found abundant coal, any fuel that can increase its power. Not only will it not be extinguished, but it will become more intense. It constantly seeks opportunities to come out and burn the hands, feet, and any part of the limbs of the destroyers, melting away any traces of evil on the ground. Once the time is ripe, it will explode with a bang, shaking the heavens and the earth, and returning to the surface.

### Fame

— Wen Ge

Life is ordinary, and how long does human life last? Some people sigh, unwilling to spend their lives in silence. They frown and an idea comes to mind, feeling that they can do a great career and leave a "name" in people's minds. Therefore, people have one more task: in addition to seeking profit, they also seek fame. With fame, one can be known in one's time and be passed on to future generations, so that when people hear it, they will be respectful and fearful. Achieving both fish and bear's paw in one fell swoop is a great thing.

Fame is dead, and to have fame, one must seek it. The methods of seeking it are nothing more than drilling, flattering, and praising. I am learning how to drill, flatter, and praise. The specific procedures cannot be said, but fortunately, I have heard and seen some of the benefits of these successes, so I might as well say them for everyone to hear, saving the arduous journey of hiding them on famous mountains.

Assuming that your name can be known in your time, then you will be able to handle everything with ease, often sailing with the wind. For example, if you are a famous writer in the north and south, that is really amazing. Not only will readers admire you, but even editors will prostrate themselves before you. Therefore, people will snatch your articles like rare treasures. Needless to say, paper will be expensive in Luoyang. In this way, you can occasionally put on airs, being evasive, dealing with a group of manuscript pullers to increase people's belief in your great name, until it reaches the highest level. After that, even if you have bad works, you don't have to worry about them not finding a way out.

The benefits of a writer having a name are not only this. Of course, there are others. If you are tired of being a writer and want to change careers, that is very easy. You can be whatever you want, as long as you and your words reach the right place.

What applies to writers can be extended to wealthy merchants, who can also use a good name to increase their profits? Can the gentlemen of the "Hua Wei" type not use fame to leap onto the political stage? Fame has so many uses, so there are many people in the world who are busy seeking fame, so some people will shake their heads and wag their tails, saying: "The use of fame is great!"

But people are bound to die. If you, the famous writer, die, I think it will be different from ordinary people. Not only will people mourn or commemorate you, but even the government will issue an order to commend you, write a biography, send it to the National History Museum, and issue some funeral expenses. All of these are because you are famous. As for what happens later, there are naturally many benefits. Let's not talk about others, your great name can always be passed down for hundreds of millions of years with the records of history and the legends of people. So at that time, even though you are dead, you should still be grateful for yourself, because there are thousands of nameless "Ah Q"-style mediocrities who have no one to tell their stories, but you are unique, which is truly a world of difference!

If we extend this further, can the wealthy merchants and the "Hua Wei" type of people not also fight for posthumous honor by relying on the power of fame?

Fame has so many benefits, great! It can benefit you in your lifetime and extend to your descendants. Great gentlemen who love fame, why don't you come!

However, be sure not to fall victim to the poison of "people are afraid of becoming famous, and pigs are afraid of becoming fat," because these are threats from famous people who want to limit you from coming.

### Black Glasses and Icy Refreshments

— Jia Li

The moment you see this title, you immediately feel: Summer has arrived.

The scorching sun beats down on people, irritating their eyes, causing sweat to flow down like rain, so people shout: "It's hot! It's hot!"

To protect their eyes from irritation, people wear sunglasses. To sweat less, they eat icy refreshments!

But these two things, on the surface, seem to belong to summer, but they are not necessarily so. Usually, in spring or winter, you can see these two things. For example, if you have an eye disease, you naturally have to wear sunglasses. When you feel "feverish" in a dance hall or theater, you naturally want to eat icy refreshments.

"Wearing a fur coat in June" is said to be a joke, so isn't eating icy refreshments in winter a joke? But jokes, even though they are jokes, still exist. Taking wearing sunglasses as an example, it is the same principle. Wearing sunglasses because of an eye disease is for "protection." Wearing sunglasses to avoid sunlight irritation is also for "protection." Why is wearing sunglasses considered to be summer? These are all incomprehensible questions. What is incomprehensible is a joke, and jokes are all incomprehensible.

However, we are very clear about this point: no matter how incomprehensible a problem is, if it exists, there is always a reason for it (whether it is right or wrong). And when we wear sunglasses and eat icy refreshments in the summer, not only are they not incomprehensible, but they have "definite" reasons. All of the above have been explained one by one, so there is no need to be verbose.

However, because they are not "jokes," their reasons cannot be without question, which is quite true... Wearing sunglasses in summer is to avoid sunlight irritation, and eating icy refreshments is to sweat less, but these are all caused by external blows. Because there is no resistance, these things are used as shields. As for wearing sunglasses and eating icy refreshments at ordinary times, they are all for reasons desired from the heart. Lacking resistance and using such things as shields is really not allowed to exist.

Therefore, wearing sunglasses and eating icy refreshments at ordinary times, because they come from the heart and are different from others, although they are "jokes," they are quite fashionable and elegant. On the contrary, wearing sunglasses and eating icy refreshments in the summer is not considered fashionable or elegant, but merely a sign of weakness, a "joke."

### Native Accent

— Tie

She also said: "Although I received all the letters you sent in the past, every letter was always accompanied by three Korean secret agents, perhaps mixed with a Japanese person, saying that you were a soldier in China, resisting 'Manchukuo' and resisting Japan, and that your family were all anti-Japanese elements, passing news to China." "My letters are very simple!" "Well, even if it's blank paper, he says you use all codes." "We have Japanese people in our family, doesn't our × have a Japanese wife? Aren't we truly supporting Great Japan and being its obedient citizens?" "Enough! What's so great about Japanese women? They are also abused by Japanese soldiers and are not much stronger than us." Japanese militarists not only trample on the Chinese people but also oppress their own people.

"So every time you send a letter, you not only have to ask for favors but also spend a lot of money to lobby, fortunately avoiding unexpected difficulties." "There are still unexpected things?" "Alas! It's really tearful to mention this. Last May, Tao Juren received a letter from Hankou, with 300 yuan attached, which was his old friend repaying a debt from many years ago. Everyone knew about this, but the Japanese thought it was to support the Volunteer Army and imprisoned him. Our county magistrate—the chairman of the maintenance association during the 1918 Incident, who later became the puppet county magistrate—came out to vouch for him. They said that the county magistrate was in collusion with the Volunteer Army, and as a result, the county magistrate was imprisoned for three years, and Tao Juren died. This was his friend's conscience repaying the money, but who knew it would be fatal? Later, his property was confiscated, and his son became a beggar."

Tao Juren was a wealthy man in our county, a very kind person, always responsive to requests. Everyone nearby called him "Old Good Man." In the year of the Incident, general vagrants burned everywhere, but Tao Juren was not harmed. Poor people all remember his kindness, but now he has come to this end.

"Last year, when scrap copper was collected, there was random beating. Even if you had an axe or a brazier at home, you had to send it to the village office. Once an order was given, who dared to disobey? Now there is only a kitchen knife left in the house. Where can you see the shadow of copper and iron? Even with kitchen knives, only one is allowed per household!" "So fierce?" "You still have this dismissive tone, we are like startled birds!"

"Grain stalks were collected, 20 catties from each household, and 5 catties from each elementary school student. Once the order was given, they were all sent to the county seat within ten days. Strangely, even Ji Sen, who had not paid taxes for more than ten years, did not dare to fall behind. Every household not only sent the prescribed amount but also brought a few catties more, for fear that the person weighing it would say they were short and slap them."

"Public bonds are raised. I don't know how many public bonds have been issued. They are sent to households one by one. The name is fundraising, but they are actually forcing you to buy a hundred. Who dares to buy ninety-nine? Everyone knows that public bonds are waste paper. Who doesn't bitterly pray to heaven, hoping that the national army will recover the lost land and return to the embrace of the motherland!"

"I heard that various donations will be increased this year. As for how to explain this 'voluntary donation,' only heaven knows."

Later, I asked her about the Zhanggufeng Incident. How did the Northeast newspapers report it? She said that Northeast newspapers never reported the Changkufeng Incident or the Mutugou Incident. I asked her about the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan! "The newspapers praise Japanese victories every day. Who believes it! Even the Taierzhuang battle, the newspapers did not report the Chinese victory. I don't know who spread it, but everyone knows about it, and they talk about it with great interest."

"Recently, they are going to levy again. The household registration check is too strict. Those without household registration cannot return, and those with household registration cannot leave. Even we women are strictly checked. Counting from the time I boarded the ship in Tianjin to leave home, I went through seven inspections and interrogations, especially at the Tianjin International Bridge, which was the most dangerous. It can be considered a narrow escape."

Ah! ××××××× seizes our money, collects our iron, drinks ××××!

Our compatriots living overseas, ×××, stop living in a drunken dream. (The End)
