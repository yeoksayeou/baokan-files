### Striving for Even Greater Diplomatic Victories

"Striving for even greater diplomatic victories" is our major task in the second phase of the War of Resistance, and it is also a prerequisite for safeguarding peace in the Far East and world peace. We must do our utmost and fight heroically to perfectly accomplish this task.

What diplomatic victories have we achieved during the one and a half years of the War of Resistance? Why should we strive for even greater victories? And is it possible to strive for greater victories? What greater victories should we strive for, and how should we strive for them?

The one and a half years of the War of Resistance have created an unprecedentedly victorious situation in our country's diplomacy. On the negative side, we have gone from Wang Jingwei's policy of "negotiating while resisting" to "stopping diplomatic negotiations with the invading country"; from the stagnation of the Nanjing and Wanping negotiations to the complete cessation of all divisive and partial diplomatic actions; and from the repeated frustration of compromise conspiracies in diplomatic negotiations by Japanese and German ambassadors and pro-Japanese factions to the recent total retreat of the line of German and Italian surrenderism that emerged with Wang Jingwei's betrayal of the motherland. On the positive side, from the full-scale unfolding and persistence of the War of Resistance, we have achieved the unification, clarity, and strength of our diplomatic policy; and we have achieved the establishment and persistence of the diplomatic policy of "uniting all democratic and peace-loving countries to jointly oppose fascist aggressors." The comprehensive achievements of the above-mentioned negative and positive diplomacy, reflected in concrete victories, are: first, the great significance of China's War of Resistance against Japan in striving for the freedom of the Chinese nation and safeguarding world peace has gradually been understood, sympathized with, and supported by the vast majority of peace-loving and righteous people around the world; second, the cruelty and barbarity of Japan's war of aggression against China have been increasingly abhorred by people around the world due to the persistence of our War of Resistance and diplomatic policy; third, our demand for "aiding China and sanctioning Japan" has been unanimously passed by the League of Nations; fourth, the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and the Soviet Union's compliance with the League of Nations' resolution on aiding China have provided us with enthusiastic spiritual and material assistance; and fifth, the gradual change in the US government's Far East policy and the gradual activeness of the aid-China movement have influenced the gradual correction of the US government's policy of appeasement towards Japan and the gradual unfolding of the aid-China movement.

The past diplomatic successes indicate that the international situation, which is unfavorable to the Japanese and beneficial to us, has gradually developed. Is it possible for it to develop to be even more unfavorable to the Japanese and more beneficial to us? We believe that it is absolutely possible. First, it is absolutely impossible for the forces of Japanese fascist aggressors to reach a compromise with the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, or any of these countries in China or the Far East; on the contrary, the development of Japanese power will inevitably further increase its conflicts with the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. This is not only clearly recognized by the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but Japan itself cannot but admit it. According to a report from the Japanese Domei News Agency, the policy speech of the Hiranuma Cabinet, which is scheduled to be announced tomorrow (the 20th), will explain that its task is to strengthen the invasion of China and exclude British and American forces; Arita's diplomatic speech will further emphasize this point, that is, to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact and perfect the establishment of a "new order in East Asia of the Japan-Manchukuo-China bloc." Second, the persistence of our country's united resistance against Japan will inevitably further strengthen the belief of democratic and peace-loving countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union in our country's final victory, and strengthen their determination to develop the aid-China and sanction-Japan movement. Third, the closer relations between the United Kingdom and France and between the United Kingdom and the United States, and the gradual convergence of the Far East policies of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, will inevitably give the Soviet Union greater convenience in actively assisting China. Fourth, the greater unity of fascist aggressors such as Japan, Germany, and Italy will inevitably increase the degree of mutual reliance and cooperation among democratic and peace-loving countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, which is even more conducive to the formation and progress of the anti-fascist aggression front in the Pacific.

However, as of today, our country's diplomatic victories are still only victories within a certain limit. This kind of victory is not enough to solve the new difficulties that our country will encounter in the second phase of the War of Resistance; at the same time, although Japanese fascist aggressors have encountered unprecedented defeats in diplomacy and are in a state of "besieged on all sides," these failures and difficulties have not immediately reached the extent of forcing the Japanese rulers to completely abandon their fascist aggression policy. Even the Japanese rulers are going more madly towards the pinnacle of fascist aggression. In this process, their evildoing will be "aggravated"! Therefore, we must never be complacent with the initial victories of the past. On the one hand, we must increase the difficulties in the future of the Japanese aggressors, so that unless they completely abandon their fascist aggression policy, it will inevitably lead to the total collapse of the fascist aggression mechanism under the pressure of internal and external situations; on the other hand, we must strive for our greater victories, to achieve the close union of peace-loving and democratic countries to actively sanction fascist aggressors, and further establish a collective security system along the Pacific coast and even the entire world. To accomplish these two major tasks, we must recognize the following points:

First, resolutely supporting the nationwide united and protracted War of Resistance is the foundation for striving for even greater diplomatic victories; and enthusiastically supporting the government's correct national policy of "uniting with peace-loving and democratic countries to oppose fascist aggression" and resolutely opposing the so-called German-Italian line of surrenderers are the most fundamental conditions for striving for even greater diplomatic victories.

Second, striving for even greater diplomatic victories cannot be an isolated pro-Russian line or a Moscow line, nor can it be an isolated Anglo-American line or a London-Washington line, nor can it be a so-called League of Nations line or a Geneva line. We must recognize the Soviet Union's peace policy and its policy of assisting weak and oppressed nations. The Soviet Union is indeed a pillar of world peace, especially a loyal friend of the Chinese nation; but we should also recognize the increasingly obvious confrontation between the fascist aggression front and the democratic peace front in the world. We must unite all forces in the world that oppose fascist aggression into the camp of our friendly forces, so that our struggle will be less isolated, and our victory can be greater and more thorough.

Third, the League of Nations is still an organization for the peace front to launch sanctions against aggressors. Because of the inherent weaknesses and defects of this organization, we certainly cannot have any extravagant hopes. However, the current international situation is very favorable to our movement to aid China and sanction Japan. The League of Nations Executive Council is now beginning to discuss our country's proposals. We must mobilize public opinion and domestic and international mass movements, and enthusiastically support the appeals of our country's representatives. In the aid-China part, we demand that all countries further implement assistance to China in medicine, military supplies, military raw materials, and technical personnel; in the sanction-Japan part, we must first implement the cessation of the export of military supplies and military raw materials such as airplanes and kerosene to Japan, and the boycott of Japanese export goods.

In addition, we must do everything possible to launch and develop a united front of peace-loving and righteous people around the world against fascist aggression, first and foremost the unified organization of anti-fascist and anti-aggression groups worldwide and in various countries. We must also do everything possible to launch and develop a united front against fascism within the fascist aggressors' own countries and among the people in their occupied territories. Only a broad anti-fascist and anti-aggression movement, closely coordinated with the strength of our national unity and protracted War of Resistance, can increase the difficulties of the Japanese invaders and complete our greater and final victory.

### The Rebirth of the Chinese Nation

— Soong Mei-ling Chiang

In front of the south entrance of St. Paul's Cathedral in London, there is a peculiar stone tablet with a Latin word engraved on it: "Resurgam." It means: "I will rise again." The origin of this stone tablet is as follows: When the dome of the church was about to be completed, the architect, Sir Christopher Wren, needed a stone to mark the center point of the building for the workers to identify. Among a pile of waste materials, he accidentally picked up an old tombstone with this Latin word engraved on it. Its meaning greatly moved the architect, so he decided to build this stone tablet on the surface and preserve it forever. This stone tablet is still there today, and anyone who sees it will spontaneously feel optimistic. This inscription, such a simple and powerful word, is especially moving for us, who are witnessing the deaths and injuries of our compatriots and the destruction of our homes and country. It will be deeply imprinted in the hearts of each of us and shine brightly on our banners!

When we open the map of China, it is easy to understand how the Japanese, relying on their superior naval, land, and air forces, have invaded more than a dozen provinces in our eastern region. So far, they have plundered many of our railway, highway, and waterway transportation lines, and have cruelly massacred countless of our compatriots, destroying their homes, their businesses, and their orchards; forcing many people to travel long distances to find a livelihood, to find a safe place to avoid bombing and slaughter.

The provinces in the east that have suffered the most from the Japanese invasion are our richest agricultural and cultural areas.

Until recently, everyone thought that the western provinces were remote and difficult to reach without enduring arduous travel and long journeys. Most of the compatriots living in the east regarded the western provinces as sacred places producing exotic flowers, rare animals, and precious metals. Everyone knew that there were towering mountains and primitive indigenous people living there, and that these mountains were the source of several major rivers in our country, but the compatriots in the east felt that it was really too difficult to approach.

Before the fall of Nanjing, the people across the country paid little attention to these remote provinces in the west, but now tens of thousands of people—some of whom are leaders in the industry, some of whom are celebrities in the academic field—are leading their colleagues and students to migrate in from ships, cars, or on foot. The result of this mass migration will accelerate the long-delayed construction of Sichuan and other western provinces. In this way, what might normally take fifty years to complete can be achieved in one year.

Our gains here will exceed the compensation for our losses. We will quickly and firmly build a revitalized country on the established foundation—a brand new, strong, and powerful Republic of China.

The pioneers who went to the western United States in the past were attracted by the ore and fertile soil there, but they went to an undeveloped virgin land. Although our west is so vast and has always been so difficult to penetrate, culture has already been established there, and dense populations live there. The reason why people have not been able to develop natural resources is because of its complicated routes and steep mountains. Except for a few places along the Yangtze River or larger tributaries where there are boats and civilian ships, the only means of transportation there rely on the slow and laborious walking of coolies or mules and horses. The difference between our west and the west of the United States at that time is that our west does not lack manpower, but only lacks technology and transportation. In other words, it only lacks the driving force to promote development. Now this large-scale migration has brought many engineers and experts to the western provinces. Air transport, such as the highways connecting the provinces, and the highways leading to Burma via Yunnan and to Europe via Xinjiang, has greatly reduced the difficulty of communication. Railways are also advancing, and at a certain time, they can communicate with neighboring Western countries.

Some people—especially the Japanese who are invading our country—believe that the day of the complete disappearance of our country's independence and our country's autonomy has come. Others believe that it is only a matter of time before we put the yoke of slavery on our necks.

These people, whether they are pessimistic or optimistic, always overlook an important historical revelation. China has become a nation and a country because it retains a power of rebirth, so it can overcome the natural and man-made disasters of the centuries and still stand between heaven and earth, unshakable.

This power of rebirth is indestructible. All of our contemporaries can see that we still possess this profound power, just as we have endured thousands of years of trials and tribulations to protect the long heritage of our ancestors and have waged long-term struggles. Our history is full of events that show this great power. We must cultivate this power, use this power, and we will never let our generation or future generations be stained with the shame of sacrificing the right to national survival. Our compatriots will continue to struggle, continue to survive, and we will revive and prosper our nation, even in the nominally occupied guerrilla areas, under extremely difficult circumstances. In those areas, the Japanese mistakenly believe that they have grasped everything, but in reality, it is just a fleeting dream. This fragile grasp will become less and less reliable over time, and as a result, under the oppression of the heroic struggle of our Chinese nation, they will definitely have to give up!

In the west, we will use our innate courage, heroic spirit, and enduring strength to build a new China—a new country forged from the crucible of war. I believe she has the wisdom to adapt to changes, and she is progressive, indomitable, and fearless.

Friendly countries who sympathize with us, and the Japanese who are destroying our country, if they have enough imagination to comprehensively consider the characteristics of our indomitable resistance over the past eighteen months, then they will definitely see that meaningful Latin word, and it will forever shine brightly in the west of our Republic of China, on the walls of our great Great Wall, and on the coastal cliffs of our coastal provinces. In that dazzling color, intertwined with the blue blood shed by the martyrs and the flames burning on the earth, the wise eyes of our souls will surely clearly see that immortal and prophetic Latin word: "I will rise again." This simple and powerful word concretely embodies the spirit of our Chinese nation.

### Review of the Domestic and International Situation in Japan

— Guo Moruo

(Continued from yesterday's second paragraph)

What troubles the Japanese the most is the Soviet Union. Japan also recognizes the Soviet Union as their enemy. During the cabinet reshuffle, the military was also worried about the Soviet Union, revealing a phenomenon of terror. As for the Soviet Union's attitude towards Japan, we can clearly see that the recent Soviet refusal to negotiate with Japan on "fisheries" has shown that the Soviet Union is already implementing sanctions against Japan. As for the national mobilization plan, this is entirely because the warlords want to seize financial power from the hands of the zaibatsu and make free requisitions. Therefore, the zaibatsu are dissatisfied with the warlords. In Itagaki's fifth condition, wanting to increase national production, we can investigate that Japan's export trade and domestic industry have suffered extremely great losses since the war began. In March and April of last year, we received reports regarding the blows suffered by the Japanese textile industry. There were six million spindles at home and abroad. Since the War of Resistance, 750,000 spindles have been destroyed in Qingdao and 300,000 spindles in Shanghai, totaling 3.5 million spindles. The losses are even greater now, and it is already declining due to the war.

The sixth requirement is to enhance national spirit. However, since the War of Resistance, there has been war-weariness among the people and anti-war sentiment among the soldiers. How can their war be expanded? A recent incident can prove that there is no oil in Japan. However, mechanized units need gasoline. Therefore, they can only rely on foreigners. Their treasury is empty. To buy gasoline, they have no cash. Therefore, they changed to using liquid fuel. That fuel is replaced by alcohol and petroleum, so they have to plant more sweet potatoes, and forcibly purchase them from farmers at two cents and three cents. However, farmers need three cents to produce sweet potatoes, so not only can they not make money, but they lose money. The government is always blindly coercive. Last year, there were already four riots in their country. These are all evidence of war-weariness, anti-war sentiment, and the inability to produce in Japan.

Looking at the Japanese situation in our country, on December 24 of last year, in Jinghai on the Jinpu Railway, the Japanese there often suffer from insomnia. Once, ten Japanese soldiers carried a machine gun and five rifles and surrendered to us. Although the number of people is small, it is enough to show that the Japanese soldiers are also tired of war on the battlefield. Recently, a team of Japanese soldiers near Hankou was disarmed by the Japanese gendarmerie for launching anti-war propaganda. Itagaki's seventh requirement to increase foreign trade is that since Japan launched its war of aggression, Japan's foreign trade has only been declining. Therefore, his seven requirements, as long as we study them slightly, are self-contradictory and have no way out. Therefore, they can only increase the difficulties in Japan and promote the decline of national spirit. The revolutionary trend in the country is also bound to happen.

Speaking of our China, since our Supreme Leader Generalissimo Chiang led the soldiers and civilians of the whole country and launched the War of Resistance, the national policy has always been consistent. Our national policy will not change in three, five, or ten years. Now that the War of Resistance has reached the second stage, military preparations have long been arranged. Our land is vast and our people are numerous. We are now strengthening the organization of the people in the guerrilla areas, strengthening the guerrilla forces, and building the core of the guerrilla areas. We are turning the rear of the Japanese into our front lines. Without exaggeration, a guerrilla core can control the strength of at least three Japanese divisions. If we have ten guerrilla areas, we can control thirty Japanese divisions. The more guerrilla cores there are, the more the Japanese will be absolutely unable to move. General Peng Dehuai once talked about the guerrilla warfare in Wutai Mountain, Shanxi. The Japanese army used the strength of three divisions to try to wipe out our guerrillas. As a result, we became stronger and stronger. They were killed a brigade commander and a regimental commander. Moreover, there is also an anecdote, that is, the Japanese army in our guerrilla war zone relies on air transport for their food supply. Therefore, our guerrillas disguised themselves as Japanese soldiers, and as a result, the food was all obtained by us. Recently, the battle situation on the front line can be said to be more intense than at the beginning of the War of Resistance. For example, after the fall of Wuhan, the Japanese army only occupied Yuezhou and was unable to invade Changsha. After occupying De'an, it was unable to invade Nanchang. This proves the strength of the fighting power of the soldiers on the front line. Therefore, in the future military affairs of our second phase of the War of Resistance, we are more confident.

China's industry originally focused on the areas along the river and along the coast, but now it has been completely moved to the inland. Now we are trying our best to enrich production, and the transportation in the rear has also completed a lot without our knowledge. This proves that our government is doing its best to develop construction. When I was in Guilin, I met an old man who proudly said: We Guangxi people could not build railways, but now we can also build railways. Therefore, in the year and a half of the War of Resistance, we seem to have suffered losses in appearance, but internally we have gained infinite and great victories. It is absolutely impossible for the Japanese to use methods to deal with China. We have pushed the Japanese from a first-class country to the final stage. Next, the Japanese must "XXXX" (End)

### Strict Ban on Spreading Rumors in Chongqing: The Tragic Aftermath of the Bombing is Too Horrifying to Witness

[Special Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, 17th] The authorities today sent a letter to the military and police strictly prohibiting traitors from spreading rumors. Those caught will be treated as collaborators.

[Dispatch from Our Chongqing Office, Approximate Air Travel Time] Sichuan Province is the hinterland of the Southwest, thousands of miles away from the front lines. Furthermore, as an undefended city, for over a year, we had not heard the sound of guns or cannons, leading us to believe that the Southwest rear would not suffer the scourge of the enemy. Unexpectedly, disaster has arrived at our doorstep. After noon on the 15th, the wailing air raid sirens began to blare in Chongqing. Soon after, the urgent sirens followed one after another. Citizens, as if by agreement, sought shelter in safe areas, each searching for cover. In the midst of this, twenty-seven enemy planes arrived over Chongqing. The sound of machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, and bombs dropped by the enemy planes enveloped the entire city. A full hour passed before the all-clear siren finally sounded.

A Glimpse of the Bombed Disaster Area

At the moment when the all-clear siren had not yet sounded, people surged from the fields below like a tide, then desperately climbed towards the mountains opposite. The reporter was mixed in with the crowd at the time and also climbed up a bare hill. Looking at the side of the hill, there were a few black smoke-filled chimneys still intact, but the houses around them were as riddled as a honeycomb. Especially those few small houses that suffered the worst, their walls and tiles had all turned into mud powder.

After the all-clear siren sounded, the reporter rushed down from the hill in one breath to the scene of the disaster. At the edge of the nearby field, people were trembling, sighing, and cursing around a severed arm that had flown over. From the delicate flesh on the arm and the blackened palm with traces of coal, it could be determined that the deceased was still a young worker, but his useful life was so brutally taken away by the enemy.

It seemed that one family had suffered the most tragically. Inside the house—it looked like a collapsed building—seven or eight victims lay horizontally and vertically. The head of one female corpse was missing, and the leather coat on her body, along with a piece in front of her, was gone, blown away to who knows where. Two members of the civil defense force were guarding a foot-long infant, providing emergency treatment to passersby. Pitifully, the innocent little life was like a clay doll, lying stiffly. A thin slit was slightly open between its eyes, and its teeth and nostrils were all filled with soil. There was a dried blood clot on the top of its head. Such a weak and helpless little infant should have been in the warm and soft embrace of its mother, sucking its mother's milk and spending its childhood in comfort—but our wicked enemy had taken its life in this way.

In just a few minutes of inspection, we discovered that there were as many as eight children who had died in one or two houses. Their innocent and pure faces had all become like pumpkins, pale and swollen, covered with dry dirt, as if they had just been dug out of the ground.

Just as I was about to leave this bombed area to inspect elsewhere, two seven- or eight-year-old children, their faces covered in tears, walked hand in hand towards the bombed-out house, shouting "Mama, Mama!" I couldn't bear to listen anymore. My heart sank within me. I only hoped that the woman whose head had been blown off was not their mother.

Regarding the Aftermath

After inspecting the disaster area, in order to understand the exact number of civilian deaths and injuries and the authorities' measures after the tragic bombing, the reporter made a special visit to Xu Zhongqi, Director of the Chongqing Police Bureau and Commander of the Civil Defense Corps. He told the reporter: The exact number of deaths cannot be accurately determined at the moment, but it is generally around two to three hundred. As for the people killed and injured and the members of the Civil Defense Corps who died in the line of duty, it has been decided to request superior authorities to provide generous compensation and pensions. Meanwhile, the situation has been reported orally to the central authorities. The authorities are also very concerned about the evacuation of the city's population and have issued instructions. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices in the future, the evacuation of Chongqing's population will be intensified from today. It is hoped that the families of civil servants in various agencies will evacuate voluntarily. As for other citizens in the city without fixed occupations, those who do not need to stay in Chongqing will be instructed to evacuate as soon as possible by the sub-bureaus. If necessary, compulsory evacuation will be enforced, and they will be ordered to move out of the city. It is hoped that the general public will both preserve the nation's vitality and value their own lives and property, reducing unnecessary harm and sacrifice.

In addition, the Air Defense Department also attaches great importance to the work of providing compensation and relief to the civilians who were killed and injured in this incident. It is reported that the department will immediately join relevant agencies to organize an air raid casualty relief committee so that citizens from various places under its jurisdiction who are injured and killed and sent to Chongqing can be provided relief in a coordinated manner by the committee. Secondly, in order to evacuate and provide relief to civilians who have lost their homes in the air raids, the department will immediately convene municipal government and other agencies in the city to discuss finding vacant land to build temporary shelters that can accommodate tens of thousands of people, and the relief association has also agreed to allocate funds for subsidies.

### The Puppet Regime Covets the Peiping Branches of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications

[Associated Press, Peiping, 18th] According to banking circles, the "Puppet United Reserve Bank" is currently investigating the Peiping branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. It is widely believed that the two banks will soon be reorganized into semi-official banks under the "Puppet United Reserve Bank" system, but the names will not be changed.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 18th] The Japanese cabinet today approved a "Three-Year Plan" to expand the productivity of Japan, "Manchukuo," and China. The plan is scheduled to begin in January of this year and end in April 1940, with a cost of £60 million.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 18th] According to Japanese reports, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway may be electrified this month. The railway has been suspended for more than a year due to the destruction of bridges. If the resumption of traffic is successful in the future, then the Shanghai-Peiping train may be restored.

### Four Banks Ordered to Recover Damaged Banknotes

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 17th] The Ministry has ordered the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank to be responsible for recovering damaged banknotes in order to avoid losses to the poor.

### More Than 300 Battles in the Taihu Lake Area: Enemy Casualties Exceed 4,000; Many Weapons and Ammunition Seized

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 17th] Shanghai Dispatch: There have been frequent battles near Suzhou recently, with no fewer than 300 of varying sizes in the past month. Enemy casualties have reached over 4,000. Our guerrilla forces have also seized over 1,000 rifles, over 300,000 rounds of ammunition, over 70 machine guns, and several steamships.

[Central News Agency, Taiping, 16th] A unit of our guerrilla forces encountered about 30 enemy soldiers at 7:00 a.m. on the 15th while patrolling in the Qijia Township (south of Qingyang County) area. Fierce fighting lasted for one hour.

[Central News Agency, Shashi, 18th] (1) The main force of the enemy troops in central Hubei has recently concentrated in the Huayuan and Xiaogan areas, seemingly attempting to invade west via the Hua-Xiang Road and Han-Yi Road. We have taken strict precautions. If the enemy invades, they will definitely be severely attacked. (2) A detachment of four to five hundred enemy soldiers, with eight motorboats, has been actively operating in recent days and is rushing to build a road to Maichazui, with signs of an invasion toward Xiantao. (3) Wamiaoji was occupied by the enemy on the 15th but was quickly withdrawn, seemingly to test our defenses. (4) The enemy advancing from Baimamiao is currently engaged in fierce fighting with us at Guanyin Cliff.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 17th] On the morning of the 8th, our troops destroyed the Pinglin Temple, Changlinggang, and areas near Baishuling at Shoushan Kuangjia Lou, and also destroyed over 300 meters of telegraph lines. The enemy in Mazha attacked our Guanjiahe on the 3rd with 300 infantry and 28 mountain guns. The battle was quite fierce. We are still defending Guanjiahe, killing over 20 enemy soldiers. The enemy in Zaoshi increased by about one artillery regiment on the 14th and stationed in Zaoshi and Wamiaoji.

### Suspension of Overdrafts and Debt Repayments: No Impact on Foreign Exchange; Stabilizes Exchange Rates

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] According to well-informed sources, the central government's announcement a few days ago of suspending the payment of interest on foreign debts secured by customs tariffs has had no impact on China's exchange rates. Although the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender has declined since last spring, Shanghai and other inland refugees do not have large amounts of silver coins to exchange for foreign currency. Now that the government is implementing the suspension of interest payments on foreign debts, it is actually protecting China's original foreign exchange reserves. Therefore, it is said that the result of this measure will be to stabilize the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender in the long term.

### The Entire Chinese Population Has a Belief in Inevitable Victory: Ambassador Johnson Tells People Upon Returning to the United States

[Reuters, New York, 18th] U.S. Ambassador to China, Johnson, has returned to Washington to report on his duties. According to him, the Chinese people's hope for ultimate victory is high. Johnson has apparently reported to the State Department on the situation he directly obtained from Chiang Kai-shek and other Chinese officials.

Zhang Pengchun Arrives in England and Makes Remarks En Route

[Reuters, London, 17th] Dr. Zhang Pengchun, a professor at Nankai University, flew to London from Chongqing. He stayed in Yangon for three days and met with people in academic circles. The entire trip lasted nine days. He told our reporter, "Even if we cannot obtain external assistance, we are still sure that we can obtain ultimate victory." He also said, "The Sino-Japanese War has now entered the second stage. The first stage was defensive, up until the fall of Hankou. The second stage is preparation for a full-scale counteroffensive. China will field 240 divisions, each with 10,000 soldiers. At that time, there will be no so-called positional warfare, nor will there be any so-called front lines, but a new kind of full-scale mobile warfare. Military expansion will extend to all parts of the country. He believes that Japan does not have sufficient troops to offer effective resistance. Furthermore, China's international assistance is gradually materializing according to the expected timeline, that is, 18 months after the start of the war." He concluded by saying, "China's plan is not only to expel the Japanese, but also to build a new nation."

### New Military Aircraft Transported from the United States via Burma to Our Country; A Batch of American Pilots is Already En Route

[Reuters, London, 18th] According to a Times correspondent in Yangon, a U.S. military aircraft equipped with heavy weapons has arrived here and will be transported to China immediately. It is reported that this aircraft is for demonstration purposes and will be transported to China first. Then, similar aircraft will be transported by specially chartered ships. American pilots have also been arriving here in succession, transferring to China to train Chinese pilots on how to fly this type of aircraft. A batch of machine guns ordered by the Chinese side has also arrived on the same ship.

[Haitong News Agency, Yangon, 18th] The British cargo ship "Worcestershire," carrying American aircraft and machine guns, arrived here yesterday. It is understood that this batch of military supplies is being transported to China under the terms of the US$25 million loan to China. It is also reported that more military supplies will arrive soon, and American instructors will come to China to train Chinese pilots. It is understood that this batch of military supplies will be transported to the Chinese mainland via the recently completed Burma Road.

### The Situation in the Northwest and River Defense

— By Our Special Correspondent, Bai Yun

4. Will the Enemy's New Offensive Begin in the Northwest?

Our national defense lines are now in the Southwest and Northwest, both of which have vital connections to our international transportation and are places we can no longer afford to lose. The Northwest has a vast area and an extremely long front line. From the Yellow River defense line passing through western Shanxi and eastern Suiyuan, all the way to western Henan and northwestern Hubei, these are all the outer areas of the Northwest. The enemy cannot begin by attacking Xi'an and Lanzhou; they must first do some preparatory work, that is, first be able to control this very long outer line or some important parts of this outer line. So, from where will they begin their offensive? Or will they launch an offensive along the entire line at the same time? We believe that the enemy does not have the strength to launch an offensive along the entire line at the same time. They must place their main force on the more important side, while simultaneously launching feints on other sides. In this way, their main force must be placed in southern Henan and the central section of the Longhai Railway, aiming at Xi'an and invading westward. At the same time, a portion of their forces will launch feints from areas around Xiangfan, Nanyang, Wuyuan, Linhe, Liulin, and Yumen, attacking various places in western Henan, southern Shaanxi, Ningxia, and northern Shaanxi.

To achieve this goal, the enemy must do a lot of difficult preparatory work: First, Xiangfan, Nanyang, Wuyuan, and other places cannot be obtained easily. Second, in order to facilitate their westward military operations, they must first clear the Pinghan Railway and control the central section of the Longhai Railway centered on Zhengzhou, attacking Luoyang and Shanzhou. However, there are the dangers of Hulao Pass and Hangu Pass between Zhengzhou and Tongguan. Along the line, we have demolished the city walls and built fortifications in various counties, and the terrain in western Henan is treacherous, and the people are strong and brave. The enemy's westward invasion will consume considerable time and effort. Third, there is the great danger of the Yellow River between Shanxi and Shaanxi. Hundreds of thousands of our troops are scattered throughout Shanxi. It is by no means an easy task for the enemy to rely solely on crossing the river to invade Shaanxi. Therefore, they must first advance westward along the Longhai Railway with their main force and cross the river from western Shanxi to assist in the advance. However, to achieve this goal, they must use an extremely large force in the Shanxi border area. The first loss is to attack northwestern and northeastern Shanxi in order to ensure Datong, the most important rear transportation hub. Secondly, it is necessary to attack the guerrilla teams on both sides of the Datong-Puzhou Railway and the Zhengtai Railway in order to ensure the transportation lines in the east, south, west, and north. Finally, it is also necessary to attack our military bases in central, southeastern, southwestern, and southern Shanxi, block all the river crossings, cut off our connections with the rear, and place the entire Shanxi under their control before they dare to cross the river, in order to coordinate their westward military operations along the Longhai Railway. However, to complete this task, a very long time and a great deal of military strength must be expended; otherwise, it cannot be done. Some people say that the enemy wants to attack northern Shaanxi; some people say that the enemy wants to attack Ningxia first; and others say that the enemy wants to attack Ningxia and Hanzhong at the same time in order to reach Lanzhou and encircle Xi'an. This is a dangerous route that deviates from the railway line and goes deep into the interior, and almost most of it is mountainous terrain, where the enemy's large armies cannot deploy and heavy weapons are not easy to use. Its difficulty is even greater than invading west along the Longhai Railway. Moreover, the enemy does not have sufficient troops to use. Therefore, we believe that the possibility of the enemy attacking the Northwest is to invade Xi'an westward along the Longhai Railway. Naturally, after the enemy has been defeated in its westward advance along the Longhai Railway, it is also possible that it will take advantage of the weakness to attack our relatively weak areas (such as Ningxia). We cannot rigidly determine the enemy's overall offensive strategy.

Here, we want to bring up the issue of intelligence work. With accurate intelligence, we can make accurate judgments about the enemy's situation. With accurate judgments about the enemy's situation, we can win. We must pay attention to the source of intelligence and the ability of intelligence officers. For each piece of intelligence, we must make an accurate judgment based on the various circumstances of the enemy, ourselves, and the international situation at the time. Never treat rumors as intelligence, and never consider every piece of intelligence to be correct without thinking. In this way, it will greatly harm military affairs.

### Recently, Our Forces Annihilated Over 20,000 Enemy Troops in Guangdong and Shanxi Provinces; the Imminent Approach of a Major Battle Places Us in an Advantageous Position; an Official Discusses the Battle Situation on Various Fronts

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 18th] A certain official stated that there are currently no major battles on any front. The engagements in Shanxi and Guangdong are also localized. Currently, our forces are actively deploying in preparation for the decisive battle of the second phase. Our international environment is improving daily, our political economy is consolidated, and our spiritual and material strength surpasses that of the past. Furthermore, the Supreme Leader is in good health and spirit, which is especially fortunate for the nation and the people. Should the battle commence, we will undoubtedly occupy a superior position. The enemy is currently adopting a defensive posture on all fronts, with frequent movements and unclear intentions. In the recent two to three weeks of fierce fighting in Guangdong and Shanxi, our forces annihilated over 20,000 enemy troops. A certain unit of ours has been sweeping up small groups of enemy puppet troops in Chahar in recent days, achieving considerable success. In Shandong Province, our replacement troops have arrived, and the enemy has concentrated at transportation hubs,不敢活動。 Recently, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway, the Jiaozhou-Jinan Railway, and the Datong-Puzhou Railway have been intermittently disrupted, which proves that our guerrilla forces in the north are indeed stronger.

Fierce Fighting Continues in Western Shanxi; Gunfire Along the River Never Ceases

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an, 18th] Fierce fighting is taking place along the highways between Hejin and Jixian in western Shanxi. The enemy is still resisting stubbornly near Yumen, and the gunfire along the river has not ceased.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Xi'an, 16th] Military News: (1) Since the 9th, the enemy attacking Yumen has been using over ten aircraft for cover to fiercely attack Longmen Mountain, which was once captured. After our counterattack, another unit of ours advanced from Xiyukou, specially routing the enemy, who returned to Hejin. All mountain passes in front of Yumen Street and north of Hejin have been cleared by our forces. (2) The enemy who fled from Xipo is currently retreating to Yuncheng from Hejin to reorganize. The enemy who collapsed eastward from Xiangning was attacked by our forces along the way, suffering heavy casualties. When the enemy passed by Niuwangmiao, they massacred dozens of civilians. Currently, that unit has fled back to Linfen, and another unit has retreated to occupy towns (over ten li northwest of Fencheng) in the Fencheng-Xiangling area. There are no enemy traces within Xishankou. (3) Over 4,000 enemy troops and over twenty artillery pieces from Jiangxian have been moving south to Likecun for days, where they are engaged in fierce fighting with a certain unit of ours. The enemy has recently transported a large amount of ammunition from Hengshui to Henglingguan. Near Cuijia, southwest of Henglingguan, approximately 700-800 enemy troops have gathered, with the intention of invading southward. (4) On the morning of the 12th, at approximately 10:00 AM, a certain unit of ours ambushed over forty trucks coming from the east in Zhangyi Village, killing over fifty enemy troops and destroying five trucks.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Xi'an, 17th] Military News: After being defeated by our forces, the enemy attacking Xixian and Shilou retreated to Zhongyang and Xiaoyi, and are gradually withdrawing to Fenyang for reorganization. Currently, there are still 400-500 enemy troops in Jiuyu. The enemy has set up a railway block in Hejin, and there are over 100 enemy troops at Hujia Yao. There are 400-500 enemy troops each in Fenyang and Xiaoyi. A unit of our pursuing troops has advanced to Wuxizhuang, belonging to Xiaoyi, and another unit is about to approach the suburbs of Xiaoyi.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Xi'an, 17th] It has been confirmed that over 200 enemy troops who invaded eastward from Jiangxian on the 10th were killed by our forces. When the enemy collapsed westward from Limao Village and Weizhuang, there were over ten trucks and over thirty carts, fully loaded with corpses, being transported to the county. Furthermore, on the 10th, a certain unit of ours killed ten enemy troops fleeing north from Xiaxian near Miaocun. Mengcheng added 700-800 enemy troops on the 10th, claiming they would invade Yicheng. Our forces are separately blocking them.

[Dispatch from the Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] According to yesterday's Chinese report, Chinese forces have achieved victories in Shanxi Province, and Japanese forces have been forced to retreat along the east bank of the Yellow River. At the same time, Chinese forces have cut off the enemy's retreat route, forming an encirclement. Therefore, the Japanese forces will soon be completely eliminated. Yesterday, the two armies engaged in fierce fighting in Hejin, and the Japanese forces were defeated. It is also learned that there were also engagements north of Linfen.

Our Forces Launch Attacks in Western Guangdong; Fierce Fighting on the Outer Lines of Guangzhou

[Special Dispatch from Qujiang, 17th] Enemy troops in Guangdong have indeed increased, venturing out from various strongholds along the railways and highways to create disturbances. Our forces have also reinforced and launched attacks. In recent days, there has been fierce fighting near Sanshui, Conghua, Zengcheng, Shilong, and Dongguan on the outer lines of Guangzhou. The East, West, and North Rivers are still firmly held by our forces. Zhongshan is also quiet.

[External Dispatch from Macau, 18th] Over twenty Japanese warships and transport ships are currently concentrated around Zhuhai Island, most of which only arrived yesterday. The date of the Japanese invasion of Beihai must be approaching. According to reliable news this morning, Japanese forces between Beihai and Macau have greatly increased. Japanese aircraft are also quite active along the coast of Hainan and Beihai this morning.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Qujiang, 17th] On the 13th, a certain unit of ours, starting from Xiaoshi and Shuangfeng Mountain, besieged the enemy at Xiaotang, Mao'er Cen, and Quanjong. On the same day, another unit of ours, passing through Beian and Juizui, attacked the enemy's rear at Shengang. The fierce fighting continued until night, and the enemy, unable to withstand it, fled back to Shengang and Taipingchang. Our forces are currently pursuing them towards Shangxia Sankeng and Taipingchang. In this battle, over 100 enemy troops were killed.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 17th] Over 500 enemy troops who attacked Huaping and Lianglonglu in Huaiji were repelled by our forces on the morning of the 14th. On the night of the 15th, their numbers increased to over 800, and they circled around to attack Zhugaopu and Lianglongxu from Changgangxu. Our forces, due to being threatened from the side and rear, shifted towards the north of the county seat. Since the morning of the 16th, the enemy has been attacking with land and air forces, with over ten aircraft fiercely bombarding our positions. Our forces, due to heavy casualties and a disparity in numbers, were forced to retreat to XXXXX positions and continue to resist.

[Dispatch from the Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] In South China, the Japanese side has become active again, intending to approach Xinshi, 25 kilometers from Guangzhou. Although Japanese troops have reached the outskirts of the city, Chinese forces have put up extremely strong resistance, and finally repelled the Japanese troops.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Guilin, 18th, 10:00 AM] Five enemy warships and a total of twenty other vessels have concentrated at Zhuhai Island and are constructing a large airfield on the island, indicating quite active intentions.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Guilin, 18th, 1:00 PM] The main force of the enemy at the Sanhong River mouth, approximately 2,000 troops on the upper reaches of the Xiang River, and approximately 800 enemy troops at Foshan have all been supplementing the forces at Sanshui. There are a total of 3,000 enemy troops at Sanshui and approximately 4,000 in the Jiujiang area. Judging from their intentions, they intend to attack Heshan from Jiujiang and Sanshui, making a roundabout side attack, with the intention of attacking Guilin.

New Qiang River in Hunan Province is Quiet; Zhanggong Ferry in Jiangxi Province Falls

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Changsha, 17th] The line from the Xinqiang River to Jiuling is currently quiet. The enemy facing us is currently stubbornly resisting at the first line of strongholds with a small number of troops. Their follow-up troops seem to be actively redeploying and reorganizing for rest.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanchang, 17th] After our forces recovered Zhanggong Ferry, the enemy reinforced and counterattacked, and it fell into enemy hands again that night.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Nanchang, 17th] Recently, enemy forces in Nanxun have again attempted to attack our guerrilla base in Mount Lu. On the morning of the 15th, the enemy suddenly launched an attack on a certain commando team and the people's self-defense force at Mengjia Mountain at the foot of Mount Lu, but failed by nightfall. At the same time, enemy forces at Jianshan in the southwest of Mount Lu also shelled Baiyi Palace thirty times. Enemy forces at Gaolong in eastern Mount Lu and Xijia Mountain constantly shelled our positions. The enemy's intention seems to be to break through our positions on Mount Lu. However, we have long been prepared.

### Representative Gu Urges All Nations to Jointly Sanction Japan; Presents Seven Important Conditions; Requests Assistance to Resist Aggression

[Dispatch from the Haitong News Agency, Geneva, 18th] Yesterday afternoon, during the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, Dr. Gu Weijun, leader of the Chinese delegation, delivered a powerful speech for over an hour, requesting the Assembly to assist China. His conditions are as follows: (1) Financial and economic sanctions against Japan; (2) League of Nations member states should implement a boycott of Japanese goods; (3) Prohibition of the import of raw materials for military supplies into Japan; (4) Strict prohibition of the transport of aircraft and kerosene to Japan; (5) League of Nations member states should effectively assist China through economic means; (6) Simplify the procedures for transporting military supplies to China; (7) All League of Nations member states with interests in the Far East should jointly organize a special committee to review methods of resisting Japan and preventing Japan from continuing its war against China. Mr. Gu also stated that assisting China in resisting aggression is actually for the sake of the interests of all nations, as a free China will certainly make great contributions to world commerce. He also said that in recent weeks, Chinese forces have won consecutive victories, and their strength is increasing in the resistance in the western provinces. Furthermore, the guerrilla tactics of the Chinese forces will intercept the Japanese forces and prevent them from being deployed. He is confident that Hangzhou will be recovered in the near future. Furthermore, in the provinces nominally occupied by the Japanese forces, 93% of the land is still under the administration of the Chinese forces today. In South China, since January, Chinese forces have planned to recover Guangzhou. Currently, all the actual situations can prove that Chinese forces still have the strength to deal with everything. As for the peace conditions proposed by Prime Minister Konoe the other day, if China agrees to accept them, the entire Asia will be under the control of Japanese warlords in the future. Konoe's advocacy of the "Manchukuo" Greater Group is an attempt to forcibly place the Far East under Japanese rule. China's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, in other words, China's diplomacy will be controlled by the Japanese, and China would become a "Shina." He also stated that China's not participating in the Anti-Comintern Pact does not mean that it is adopting communism or implementing communist policies, as the Chinese government has long made a decision, and domestic and foreign policies have been clearly defined. He also stated that the Open Door Policy can only be maintained after China has freedom and independence. He also stated that if Japan wins, Japanese culture will be forcibly implemented in China, but Japanese culture is far inferior to Chinese culture, as is known to the world. Finally, Mr. Gu stated that President Roosevelt's speech on the 4th of this month said that if Japanese forces win, foreign commercial relations in the Far East will be over. Therefore, he hopes that all nations will consider this. It is heard that China's proposal will be debated at today's Assembly.

[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 18th] The Times published a commentary today, stating, "Dr. Gu Weijun's repeated appeals to the League of Nations are of doubtful effectiveness, as they can only deepen the political weakness of the League of Nations on the whole. The majority of member states of the League of Nations have formally stated that although they have obligations under Article 16 of the Covenant, its meaning should be revised. They did not say that the obligations under that article should be voluntary and depend on the circumstances of each case. For example, the financial and economic assistance to China listed by Dr. Gu can be effective.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Geneva, 18th] The League of Nations Administrative Council held a public meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss China's request for sanctions against Japan. The Chinese representative, Ambassador to France Dr. Gu Weijun, delivered a speech.

[Dispatch from Reuters, Geneva, 17th] Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun, in today's General Assembly of the League of Nations Administrative Council, requested the League of Nations to prohibit the transport of aircraft and gasoline to Japan, stating, "This prohibition is sufficient to stop Japan's work of destroying China. "China respects the Open Door, while Japan wants to dominate it alone." Mr. Gu also elaborated on the Chinese guerrillas' activity strategy behind Japanese lines and its success. Mr. Gu also stated, "The main purpose of the establishment of the League of Nations is to seek international peace and security, so it can be called a peace institution. Although there have been various failures in the past, the Chinese government still believes that it is sufficient to promote peace, and member states, especially the most responsible member states, are still fully prepared to assist in its efforts. The real tool to prevent war does not have to be war itself. President Roosevelt said, 'Besides war, there are other ways to sanction aggressors. What are these methods? That is, to exclude the goods of the aggressor country.' In the current situation, prohibiting the import of Japanese goods by direct or indirect methods can defeat Japan's economic foundation in the shortest time. Eighty percent of Japan's silk production is imported into one country, and four out of five of its textiles are usually sold to three or four countries." Dr. Gu said that this kind of boycott movement has been automatically implemented by the people of many countries, so it is not difficult for the government to implement it. The Administrative Council should make a decision on the matter of prohibiting the export of aircraft and gasoline to Japan, and then transfer it to member states for implementation. The Chinese government hopes that the Administrative Council can make recommendations to member states to provide China with financial and economic assistance to develop and build the southwestern provinces of China and to provide relief to refugees. Furthermore, military supplies provided to China by various countries must also enjoy transportation convenience, so that it can continue to resist the aggression of Japan with effort. In the past eighteen months, the Chinese government has experienced many difficulties in seeking this kind of transportation convenience, and the impact on China's resistance has been significant. The Chinese government now requests the Administrative Council to take special steps to establish a "Coordination Committee." However, if it feels that it is difficult to implement a "full" committee at present, the Chinese government is willing for the Administrative Council to establish a small-scale "Coordination Committee" composed of representatives of countries that pay special attention to the situation in the Far East. Furthermore, the actions taken by various countries to assist China in resisting the war should not be regarded as beneficial only to China, but also to the maintenance of international law and international order, and various countries will benefit. Moreover, all countries with direct rights and interests in the Far East have this legitimate guarantee, which is also sufficient to ensure their own security. According to past experience, if the Chinese people cannot be masters of their own destiny, then it is obviously impossible to maintain the interests of Western countries in China. If we want to continue to maintain the Open Door in China, we must give the Chinese people full power to manage their families. The League of Nations should have taken effective action to stop Japan's aggression long ago. Unfortunately, this opportunity has already passed, and it has been delayed for too long. All countries that own important territorial rights and economic commercial rights in the Far East have a more serious obligation to protect these rights. In the past eighteen months, Japan has abused these rights and expanded the scope of its aggression. All countries should be clear about what they will encounter in the future. If the countries concerned do not intend to abandon their treaty rights and vested interests in China, and in fact, they are not so prepared, then they should not miss the opportunity and should act together to stop the spread of Japan's aggressive ambitions. If all countries can take resolute and agile action, they will certainly gain without loss." According to various predictions, before the adjournment of the General Assembly, another closed meeting will be held to discuss the Chinese government's request.

Representative Gu Issues Statement; Japan Violates the Spirit of Trusteeship

[Dispatch from Reuters, Geneva, 17th] After the League of Nations Mandates Commission submitted a report on the islands under Japanese mandate, Dr. Gu Weijun specially issued a statement stating that according to the "Japanese Mobilization Law" of May 1938, overall mobilization has been implemented on the islands, which is inconsistent with the spirit of the mandated area. Therefore, he has the right to submit this matter to the League of Nations Administrative Council, having obtained a great deal of information on it. Montesu, the reporter of the committee, said that if information is submitted to the Mandated Areas Committee, the committee should express its opinion.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Geneva, 18th] The League of Nations Administrative Council held a public meeting yesterday to discuss the report of the Mandates Commission. The British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Batra, delivered a brief speech on the Palestine issue, first stating the report of the Palestine issue investigation team and the Palestine issue meeting to be held in London, and suggested that if the meeting obtains a specific decision, then the Mandates Committee should then hold a meeting to consider what amendments should be proposed, so that the Administrative Council will have a basis when it holds a meeting on the 5th, without delay. At that time, the convener of the Mandates Committee, Latvian Foreign Minister Montes, stood up and replied, accepting Batra's suggestion.

### US Senator Proposes to Stop Buying Silver; Frank Farther Appointed Judge; Senate Passed It the Other Day

[Dispatch from Reuters, Washington, 17th] Today, US Senator Winson proposed a bill advocating the immediate cancellation of the authorities' power to purchase silver and issue silver certificates. The purpose is to maintain the domestic market so that it can purchase the existing silver in the country. The bill proposes to prohibit all silver imports. The Ministry of Finance, in addition to reserving 5.5 million ounces of new silver for future minting, will freely dispose of all silver.

[Dispatch from Reuters, New York, 17th] A correspondent from the Dow Jones Report in Washington stated that several US senators discussed methods to reduce the surplus production of cotton at a cotton conference, but failed to obtain a definite plan. Senator Smith stated that although many bills were proposed at the meeting, none have yet gained majority approval.

[Dispatch from Reuters, Washington, 17th] The US Senate today passed the appointment of Frank Farther as a judge of the country's Supreme Court. Mr. Farther is a Jewish professor at Harvard University Law School and is known for his support of liberal intellectual teachings. He is also very sympathetic to President Roosevelt's New Deal.

### Bombings in Various Parts of England; Conspiracy of the Irish Republican Army; English Police Have Been Mobilized for Alert

[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 10th] According to the results of inspections by officials across the island, the series of mysterious bombings that occurred in London, Manchester, and elsewhere on Sunday have a definite odor of conspiracy. There were three explosions in Manchester, with only one death. Other than that, there were only material losses. After the police officers were quickly transferred, their deduction was the same as that of the official side, that is, these bombings were initiated by those sympathetic to the illegal "Irish Republican Army." The police officers believe that the plan was conceived in Ireland beforehand, and then the bombs made there were transported to England. It is also worth noting that all previous conspiracies have targeted power plants. That is, an unexploded bomb was found in the Hamshire power plant in Birmingam yesterday. The bomb was placed under a main generator. If it had unfortunately exploded, it would have plunged the entire city of Birmingam into darkness. According to power department personnel, they did not know that a bomb existed at first. When they received a report saying that this kind of conspiracy had occurred in other parts of the country, they carefully inspected various parts of the factory before discovering the bomb. They are now waiting for experts from the Ministry of Interior and the police to come and inspect it. In addition to the mine factories, all gas factories and public buildings across the country are also being protected by personnel. Local broadcasting stations in the Midlands and reporting stations in Du Laozizi Weiqu have also had guards sent to them.

[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 17th] A fifteen-year-old schoolboy found a broken briefcase near Liverpool today, containing a small alarm clock. The public believes that what he found was a remnant of a bomb accessory. Near the briefcase, there was also a dilapidated bridge tower (used to support electrical wires). The main lightning line from Liverpool and Manchester to Burriston passes through this tower. London's "White Hall" was placed on alert today. Both sides of Downing Street are patrolled by police, and pedestrians coming from "White Hall" are subject to strict inspection.

[Dispatch from the Haitong News Agency, London, 18th] Yesterday afternoon, the walls of Liverpool were suddenly covered with slogans of the Irish Republican Army, demanding the establishment of a unified Irish Republic. The police immediately mobilized, tore off the slogans, and searched the areas where the Irish live. The city's power plants and public buildings have been heavily guarded.

[Dispatch from the Haitong News Agency, London, 18th] The detectives here have been fully mobilized since yesterday morning to protect power plants, gas companies, and water companies, so as to threaten the force. The sleeve and other secondary power stations are also guarded by police. Since Tuesday, the Thames River has also been patrolled by ice police, and police vehicles patrol London to maintain alert. Although the police have stepped up investigations into the bombing case, there have been no results. It is believed that because of the intensified police protection, the troublemakers will be active at night in the future. The bombing case in Birmingam on Monday remains unsolved. The police force in Manchester, Birmingam, and Edinburgh has been increased three times. The power plant in Park Berello in the west of Edinburgh is under even tighter guard, because the two power sources supply Scotland with heavy power. One of the two, which cost 2 million to build, was recently completed.

### Italy Increases Troops in Libya; If Action is Taken Against France; Germany Declares it Will Provide Support

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Tunis Port, 17th] According to natives of Italian Libya who fled to this place, from the end of November of last year to the beginning of this month, approximately 20,000 officers and soldiers from the Italian mainland army and native troops have successively arrived in the Libyan colony. After landing in the Port of Suara, they have already set off for the Tunisian border. In addition, the Italian military authorities are also building aircraft hangars in western Libya, near the border with Algeria, as a base for attacking Tunisia.

[Dispatch from Reuters, Berlin, 17th] According to authoritative sources, if Mussolini believes that the Spanish non-intervention agreement has been broken by a third country and takes any action, Germany will provide support. It is also said that the interference of France in Spain is a factor that promotes extreme unrest. Some people in France are trying to promote the government to aid the Spanish government. Italy's tough attitude towards this is also supported by people here.

[Dispatch from the Central News Agency, Rome, 18th] Because the French newspapers continue to attack Italy and are considered an insult to the army, the Italian side has been returning the medals previously awarded to Italian military generals by the French government since yesterday to retaliate against the French newspapers. Furthermore, many morning newspapers here yesterday warned France to immediately stop insulting Italian soldiers. If the French newspapers continue their anti-Italian movement, war will be inevitable. A certain newspaper replied to the comments of French newspapers, stating that Italian sailors will only leave their country to serve on the battlefield when absolutely necessary. The remarks of the French newspapers are the biggest obstacle to the realization of world peace. It now seems that the time is approaching when it is absolutely necessary. If the French continue to provoke, the Italian people will find a way to retaliate.

### Spanish Rebel Troops Attack Barcelona

[Dispatch from Reuters, Burgos, today] Spanish rebel troops are currently attacking Barcelona along the highway and have successively captured four city strongholds. They are now only twelve miles away from Igualada, the major industrial center of Spain. The government forces hold heavy troops there. The rebel troops are also approaching Igualada from the southwest, only ten miles away from the city. It is heard that the rebel troops have also captured 1,100 government soldiers and a large number of military supplies. Since the start of the offensive, the rebel troops have captured a total of 38,000 people, all of whom have been placed in concentration camps. According to the rebel troops' supreme command, the offensive on all fronts continues to make progress.

### Seeking Economic Benefits; Italian Foreign Minister Links Hungary and Romania; Promotes the Conclusion of an Agreement Between Hungary and Romania

[Dispatch from Reuters, Rome, 17th] According to the Roman Civil Report, the main purpose of the meeting between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Storadovic in Becici was to conclude a South Hungarian agreement. The main points of this new agreement are that Hungary respects the existing borders of South Romania, and South Romania guarantees fair treatment for the Hungarian minority in the country. Another purpose of the talks was to make Romania also join the agreement. In addition, it also wanted to form a connection between Italy, Hungary, and Romania to seek special economic benefits. This kind of combination will be in close alignment with the Berlin-Rome Axis, which goes without saying. Gaida, a spokesman for Mussolini, wrote in an Italian newspaper, "Changes are brewing along the Vistula and the Baltic." He reviewed the steps taken by Yugoslavia to gradually approach the Berlin-Rome Axis and said that it is in Romania's own interest to guide its policies in the same direction in the future.

### The French Government Sends a Note to Japan; Resolves to Answer the British Note in Writing; Deals with the American Protest with Evasive Arguments

[Reuters, Paris, 18th] According to the Paris correspondent of the "Times," the French government has sent a note to Japan, similar in nature to the recent notes sent to Japan by Britain and the United States.

(Tokyo, 17th) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a meeting of key department heads on the 16th to review the British note to Japan. Furthermore, after a cabinet meeting this morning, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Navy Minister Yonai jointly discussed how to respond to the British note and the American protest. The result was a decision to respond to Britain in writing. At the same time, Foreign Minister Arita will respond orally to U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew. It is said that Japan has no sincerity in this matter and intends to deal with Britain and the United States with evasive arguments.

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] It is reported that the Japanese government is willing to discuss the principle of the Open Door Policy in China with Britain and the United States. However, U.S. State Department personnel are unwilling to comment on this, saying that this Japanese suggestion was transmitted through news agencies rather than from official sources, so they do not wish to comment. However, if the Japanese government officially makes this suggestion recently, the State Department will carefully consider it.

### Erroneous Arguments in Japanese Newspapers

[Tokyo, 17th] This morning, Japanese newspapers all criticized the British note to Japan. For example, the "Hochi Shimbun" stated that Japan intends to build a "New Order in East Asia," but Britain completely ignores this. It takes a superficial view and makes presumptuous conjectures, believing that Japan will expand its control over "Manchukuo" and China. In fact, this phenomenon is already disappearing. Moreover, Japan has no intention of permanently stationing troops in China. The purpose of Japan's troop deployment is nothing more than to accelerate the restoration of peace and order in East Asia and prevent it from stepping onto the "red path." The newspaper also criticized the Nine-Power Treaty, saying, "In recent years, due to the intensification of the international situation, the treaty has long lost its effectiveness." (Translator's note: According to a Huitong News Agency dispatch, the "Hochi Shimbun's" commentary even included the phrase "Britain must have lost its mind.") Furthermore, the "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated, "What we want to ask Britain is whether Britain is determined to protect Japan or continues to support the Chiang regime to provide assistance. If Britain is willing to examine Japan's Far East policy, then Japan is also willing to explain its attitude to Britain."

### French Fleets in the Atlantic and Mediterranean to Conduct Large-Scale Exercises in North Africa; 35,000-Ton New Battleship Launched; British Ships Also to Conduct Exercises in the Mediterranean

[Central News Agency, Paris, 18th] The French Atlantic and Mediterranean fleets are scheduled to sail from the military ports of Brest in the south and Toulon this morning to the African coast and the Strait of Gibraltar to conduct winter maneuvers. After the two fleets complete their maneuvers in the Strait of Gibraltar, they will sail to the French Moroccan port of Casablanca in North Africa for joint exercises. The exercise program includes attacking Morocco from the sea and the coastal defense by the defending forces. Chief of Staff Gamelin and Vice Admiral Darlan will simultaneously study the defenses along the Moroccan coast. A total of 80 warships will participate in this exercise, including three battleships, ten cruisers, ten destroyer squadrons, two torpedo boat squadrons, two submarine squadrons, and aircraft carriers. The Atlantic Fleet is scheduled to return to its original garrison in mid-February, but the Mediterranean Fleet intends to continue patrolling Tunisia.

[Central News Agency, Brest, France, 17th] The new 35,000-ton battleship "Richelieu" was launched here today, with the wife of a shipbuilding worker breaking the bottle.

[Central News Agency, Portsmouth, England, 17th] A portion of the British Home Fleet sailed to Bode today, where it will join the Home Fleet and its various ships to conduct exercises in the Mediterranean.

Brief Commentary

### The Victory of the Spanish Government Forces

During the Anglo-Italian negotiations in Rome a few days ago, the German and Italian aggressors' expeditionary force in Spain launched a general offensive, and the Spanish rebel leader Franco shamelessly declared that the Spanish war would soon end. However, the Spanish government forces did not show weakness. Their frontline soldiers once again shattered the fierce attacks of the fascist forces, and women, children, and the elderly in the rear held anti-fascist demonstrations and parades under the bombing of aircraft, strengthening the national resistance forces. According to the Paris dispatch on the 18th, the Spanish government forces' general counteroffensive has recovered many important locations. This is a major blow to the arrogant and unscrupulous fascist aggressors. However, after the Rome talks, the German aggressors will inevitably become more rampant in Spain. This is not only a threat to the Spanish government but also directly affects the security of democratic countries in Europe. The severity of the European situation will also affect the future of our resistance. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that countries will urge the League of Nations to adopt a decision that is in line with international justice to rescue the Spanish democracy from the hands of the fascist demons. On the other hand, we ask progressive people and political parties in various countries to urge their respective governments with all their might to ensure that the Spanish government receives a constant and sufficient supply of military supplies and other necessities before the German and Italian invading forces have completely withdrawn from Spanish territory.

### Activities of Reactionary Forces in the United States

According to an 18th Washington dispatch, "Senator Townsend submitted a proposal to Congress on the 17th, requesting its passage, stipulating that all powers of the government to purchase silver licenses be revoked immediately to protect the domestic silver market in Shanghai." This is clearly an "attack" by reactionary forces in the United States against the Roosevelt administration. Because the U.S. government's recent active foreign policy of opposing fascist aggression is not only hated by the aggressive countries of Italy and Japan but has also aroused opposition from some operators in the oil, cotton, and machinery industries in the country. Just as if Britain implements retaliatory measures against Japan, it will inevitably arouse opposition from Japanese trading stores in the metal and cotton industries in the autonomous territories. What's more, international fascists and national reactionary groups are still using all kinds of special organizations and "opinion" to counterattack. However, judging from the recent situation, these reactionary forces are now greatly weakened, and the threat of fascist aggressors has created great terror among the American masses and even larger industrialists and businessmen. Any reactionary force will eventually be unable to resist the torrent of the era against slaughter and plunder.

### Review of U.S. Far East Foreign Policy - Translated by Zi Nong from the December Issue of "Asia" Monthly Last Year

Japan's reckless actions in China are lawless and simply rely on might makes right. What legal basis is there for the so-called declaration of war zones, excluding all third-country nationals? The U.S. note to Japan on October 6, 1938, was issued for this reason.

This note is very important, not only in U.S. foreign policy but also in dealing with China's future foreign policy. The report passed by the League of Nations General Assembly on October 6, 1937, was fully endorsed by the U.S. This report stated that Japan's actions "are neither based on current legal principles nor on the right of self-defense, and are in great conflict with the Nine-Power Treaty signed on February 6, 1922, and the Paris Peace Pact signed on August 27, 1928." The conference convened in Beijing in November of the same year also lacked concrete measures to implement the Nine-Power Treaty, and only issued a declaration on November 24, 1937, without fully exposing Japan's true face. On September 19, 1938, the League of Nations Administrative Council invited Japan to participate in a meeting to discuss the Sino-Japanese conflict in accordance with Article 17 of the League of Nations Covenant. On September 22, Japan formally refused to participate. Consequently, on the 30th, the League of Nations Administrative Council passed a resolution stating: "Japan refuses to participate in the meeting. In accordance with the provisions of Article 17, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant, the member states of the League may fulfill Article 16 of the Covenant and take individual action in accordance with Article 16 of the Covenant." On October 3, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately issued the following declaration:

"According to the provisions of Paragraph 3, the League of Nations recognizes that there is a war between China and Japan, which is inconsistent with the previous statements of the member states that there is no war in China. The Japanese government attaches great importance to this." Moreover, if any country imposes sanctions on Japan based on the resolution of the Administrative Council, Japan will take retaliatory steps in response.

The U.S. note to Japan on October 6 is as important as the joint protests by the U.S., France, and Britain to Japan.

The above is the first time in history that several League of Nations member states have unanimously dealt with two aggressor countries in a non-war manner. According to the League of Nations Covenant, Japan is at war, but China is not. Therefore, logically, Japan is not subject to the restrictions of peacetime international law, while China is protected. The League of Nations' declaration that Japan is at war but China is not means that the U.S. president does not have the obligation to fulfill the Neutrality Act.

However, this situation is unrelated to U.S. policy. Other countries can certainly take more effective actions to implement their policies to protect their own interests. Japan has further destroyed the interests of various countries in China.

Regardless of whether the U.S. leads the action, the treaty countries must be consistent because Japan: (1) directly or indirectly discriminates against the commerce and investment of non-Japanese in the occupied areas; (2) monopolizes the markets in the occupied areas, making it impossible for legitimate non-Japanese industries to gain a foothold; (3) Japan interferes with the property and rights and interests of various countries in the occupied areas, including transportation, travel, and residence rights.

Japan's response to the U.S. protest on November 18 was still full of sophistry and evasiveness. At this moment, the U.S. certainly does not recognize Japan's actions to "build order based on international principles in the Far East." Nor does it believe that "this is a necessary condition for Japan's survival" and the policy of "maintaining peace and stability in the Far East." The U.S. government and the public certainly unanimously oppose it. They also strongly condemned the damage to the interests of the American people due to the so-called "inevitable military actions." American people unanimously call on the government to deny the false organizations created by Japan.

At a minimum, the U.S. should stop trading with Japan as retaliation for Japan's damage to U.S. commercial activities in China and its contempt for international law.

The Treaty of Commerce and Navigation signed between Japan and the U.S. on February 21, 1911, is the basis for current Japanese-American trade.

Under this treaty, the U.S. grants Japan most-favored-nation treatment, but now Japan is destroying U.S. commerce and property in the occupied areas of China. Since 1923, Japan has announced the termination of this treaty six months in advance. Now, American people must unanimously demand that the U.S. government immediately officially announce the termination of the treaty in response to Japan's termination of the treaty more than a decade ago.

At this point, the entire American public opinion advocates implementing the Nine-Power Treaty to sanction Japan. However, Japan claims that this is an "unfeasible concept and outdated principle" that is not suitable for resolving the current Sino-Japanese dispute.

Will the people of the U.S. promote the government to maintain these concepts and international principles? The best way is to provide substantial aid to China in addition to moral support. Can the U.S. transport military supplies worth 100,000 yuan to Burma and Vietnam every month for transfer to the Chinese government? (To be continued).

### Strengthening Hong Kong's Defense; Britain Sends Blockade Ships to Hong Kong for Reinforcement; New Cruiser HMS Liverpool Also Ordered to East Asia for Garrison; Hong Kong Government to Establish Anti-Gas Training Centers in Various Districts

The Hong Kong government is actively increasing military preparations to cope with the advent of extraordinary times and strengthening the defensive capabilities of the naval and land forces. In the past year, it has been greatly strengthened in accordance with the established plan. On the naval side, high-speed speedboat teams were dispatched to Hong Kong a few months ago. According to a reporter's investigation, the British Navy Department will send two more ships to Hong Kong, one of which is a blockade and defensive ship recently completed in the UK, and the other is a new type of cruiser. The blockade ship is named "Ballone" and was recently launched in the UK. It is now sailing east. The task of this type of ship is to deploy harbor defense wire nets and obstacles for blockade line engineering. The bow is equipped with a large winch, which is very flexible in operation. One ship, named "________," recently arrived at the Singapore naval port. "Ballone" has also arrived in Singapore and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong during the day. After arriving in Hong Kong, the ship will undergo several tests and then be handed over to the Hong Kong Navy Department for crew deployment and garrison in Hong Kong. As for the British Navy's newly equipped large cruiser "Liverpool," it will also set sail to the east soon to garrison Hong Kong. This ship's equipment is all the latest type, and its combat power is very strong. In the future, after arriving in Hong Kong, Hong Kong's naval defense will have an epoch-making improvement. Furthermore, the training ship "Cornflower" of the Naval Volunteer Force is too old, and the authorities now intend to install new equipment. This matter is under consideration by the relevant parties.

In addition, the Hong Kong air defense authorities have recently been actively making air defense preparations. They are now planning to set up anti-gas training centers in various districts and invite teachers from various schools to give lectures. The Chinese language inspector has issued a notice to various schools on this matter, stating, "In order to popularize anti-gas knowledge, the government will set up anti-gas training centers in various districts to give lectures on anti-gas knowledge. All schools must send teachers to give lectures. Before the establishment of the centers, the book 'Anti-Gas and First Aid' will be distributed to various schools. School principals are requested to collect it from the office as soon as possible."

### Suddenly Attacked and Injured; Lin Baisheng Not Out of Danger; Police Ban Visits During Hospitalization; Suspect Arrested and Scheduled to Appear in Court This Morning

Former Legislative Yuan member and current person in charge of the Hong Kong "South China Daily," Lin Baisheng, was attacked by an assailant in front of the Watson's store in the Alexandra Building on Connaught Road Central at 5:15 PM yesterday, the 17th. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. At 5:20 PM yesterday, the 17th, Lin left the Connaught Road Central restaurant after drinking tea, crossed the tram tracks, and when he reached the front of the Alexandra Building, he was suddenly attacked from behind by an assailant. Lin was caught off guard and fell to the ground. The assailant immediately struck Lin's head with an iron rod. Lin dodged to the left and right, resulting in two injuries to the back of his head. The right corner of his forehead and the end of his eyebrow were also cut. Fortunately, the felt hat that Lin was wearing was still on his head, providing some protection. Therefore, although the assailant struck him several times, he did not hit any vital areas. At the time, passersby thought it was a fight and watched from the sidelines. An English soldier who happened to be passing by saw this and came to his aid, immediately arresting a suspect and sending him to the police station. According to the suspect's statement at the police station, his name is Chen Lin, 27 years old, a painter, and he lives in the Painters' Union on Shandong Street, Kowloon. The police immediately sent people to the union to inquire, but everyone said they did not know the person. It is reported that Chen Lin refused to admit to this attack and denied that anyone else was involved. The case was originally scheduled to be heard in the Central Magistracy yesterday morning, but the police requested a postponement because they still needed to collect evidence. If the collection is completed yesterday, it can be presented to the court today. Because Lin was suddenly attacked, the police refused any visits to Lin at the Queen Mary Hospital, regardless of who the person was, until the case is clarified. According to Lin's wife, the doctors reported that although Lin had lost too much blood at the time of the injury, the dangerous period had passed, and he should recover in about three weeks. According to the "Hong Kong Telegraph" last night, the English man, Robertson, who pursued the assailant that day, had just walked out of the exhibition room of the Jardine Matheson & Co. When he heard a cry for help, he saw a person falling to the ground and an assailant walking towards the post office. When he walked towards the scene, he saw another person holding an axe and hitting Lin's head, who was already lying on the ground, three times in a row. Robertson immediately shouted for help. The assailant hoped to escape through the alley between Gloucester Road and the Connaught Road Central restaurant. Robertson continued to pursue him. At that time, passersby all stood by and watched. An English medical officer, Hepworth, walked out of the Gloucester Road arcade. At that time, the man was caught. Hepworth also chased and assisted in the arrest, until Police Constable Hawkins arrived and was handed over to him for custody. According to another source, Lin is still not out of danger, and there was no improvement last night. It is also reported that Lin went to the political department of Chung Tin Bank that day and was attacked after leaving.

### The Refugee Camp at the Pier is Nearing Completion; 40 Units Built, Each Accommodating 10 People; Many Request Introductions to Apply for Residence

The Hong Kong government planned to build civilian camps near Ma Tau Chung last month to accommodate refugees fleeing from the mainland. They are now nearing completion. These residences will provide some relief to the refugees and lower-class refugees in Hong Kong during this period of increased rent. There are a total of 40 civilian camps currently being built in Ma Tau Chung, and they are expected to be completed next month. Each unit can accommodate eight to ten people, with a monthly rent of about ten yuan, including kitchen and toilet facilities. Applications have been issued. Some of the refugees in Hong Kong with slight assets have recently been requesting introductions from various community organizations. It is reported that the government has entrusted the Emergency Refugee Committee to handle this matter. The committee also elected Huang Maolin, Pan Zheng, Mrs. Vicars, Father Lai Yien, Mrs. Situ Yongjue, and others as review committee members to check whether the refugees meet the original regulations.

### ×× Japanese Merchants in Hong Kong Go to Guangzhou to Open Branches; Most Japanese Merchants Hesitate

According to foreign news, some Japanese merchants in Hong Kong recently ×××××× went to Guangzhou to conduct business. All Japanese people who have shops in Hong Kong must open a branch in Guangzhou to sell Japanese goods. However, most Japanese people think that Guangzhou has become a dead market with no business. Even if they open a business, it will be useless. They are also afraid that when the Chinese army counterattacks and rushes into Guangzhou in the future, their lives will be in danger. Therefore, except for a small number who comply with the order, most of them are hesitant.

### South China Women's Festival Association Branch: Preparing for the Second Refugee Industrial Cooperative; Yesterday's Welcome to National Women's Association President Guan Huazhen

The South China Women's Festival Association Branch held its third meeting yesterday at the Winsor Hotel. Attendees included Liu Wang Liming, Han Du, Mr. and Mrs. Li Fang, Liang Bao Ci, Liu Liang, Mrs. Xu Zhenyang, Guan Huazhen, Zhu Shaoping, and others. At 11:00 AM, Chairwoman Liu Wang Liming rose to deliver a speech and briefly introduced the attendees. Huang Han Du reported on the establishment and current state of the refugee industrial cooperative. It was stated that the cooperative members work during the day, making shoes, sewing children's clothing, and knitting sweaters, etc. Most of the various crafts are exported and sold to supply children in childcare facilities. Regarding spiritual training, it has already begun, with education conducted every evening, and lectures given weekly. Currently, the cooperative members are extremely enthusiastic about seeking knowledge and hope that various bookstores and newspaper offices will donate various newspapers and magazines, etc. Following this, Mrs. Li Fang reported that the refugee industrial cooperative has been established, but it can only accommodate fifty refugees. Currently, several letters from refugees requesting accommodation arrive daily. The establishment of a second branch is extremely urgent. After the report, everyone unanimously agreed and immediately decided to establish the second branch as soon as possible. The plan for its establishment includes major departments such as textiles, chemistry, commerce, and general handicrafts, each with its own factory. The planning and design are to be handled by the association's production team. After this proposal was passed, matters related to the association's deposit withdrawal procedures were also discussed. Then, a gathering began, and Ms. Guan Huazhen, President of the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, was invited to speak. Ms. Guan came to Hong Kong from Shanghai and will proceed to Nanjing to report to the central government. In her speech yesterday, she earnestly encouraged the women's community, hoping they would be determined to work hard for the country and enhance the status of Chinese women in the world. Finally, Mr. Zhu Shaoping, President of the Chinese Review Society, who had just arrived in Hong Kong from Europe, spoke, elaborating on the expansion of armaments in various European countries, stating that Britain's armament expansion has not yet been completed. Therefore, in the recent past, Britain has not had the strength to contend with various European countries. The European war has not yet reached the outbreak stage, and his conclusion is that a European war in 1939 will be unavoidable.

### Eighty-Eight Deaths from Pulmonary Tuberculosis in the Past Week; Dysentery Also at Six Stars

In addition, eighty-eight people died from pulmonary tuberculosis.

### The U.S. Will Broadcast to the Far East from California; Hong Kong Radios Will Be Able to Receive It

The order of U.S. shortwave broadcasting rarely allows it to reach our country. According to Ms. Smith, a Commercial Attaché at the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai, when the World's Fair is held on Treasure Island in San Francisco next month, trial adjustments of the antenna will begin. A 20-kilowatt shortwave broadcasting station will broadcast to the Far East. For these few months, broadcasts from California to the Far East will take place, with appropriate wavelengths at various times of the day. In the future, the aforementioned broadcasting station will be moved to Belmont, California. It seems that Hong Kong radio users will have more to enjoy.

### [Finding Cents to Cross the Sea]!

— Luoxia

A New Type of Business at the Ferry Pier

When you go from Hong Kong Island to Tsim Sha Tsui, or from Tsim Sha Tsui to Hong Kong Island, taking advantage of the fact that the third-class fare on the ×× Ferry Company's small ferries is four copper coins, but if you give them a half-dollar coin, you won't get any change. For a dime, you only get five copper coins back. Similarly, from Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, or Sham Shui Po, taking a small ferry to Hong Kong Island, although it's cheaper than from Tsim Sha Tsui by one copper coin, you get one coin back for a half-dollar, and six coins back for a dime. Everyone knows this. Most women are unwilling to be taken advantage of and often start many arguments. But let them laugh; the ticket sellers are "reaping the benefits"!

Therefore, most people crossing the sea, except for ignorant women and children, buy newspapers or other things at the pier, exchanging for copper coins before boarding the ferry, unwilling to let the ticket sellers profit. Because of this, a new type of business, "finding cents to cross the sea," has emerged. In the past few days, at the ferry pier in Tsim Sha Tsui, a group of eleven or twelve-year-old children can be seen holding copper coins in their hands, calling out to passengers crossing the sea, "Finding cents to cross the sea!" Everyone assumes that these are newspaper vendors who have too many copper coins and want to exchange them for silver coins. So they eagerly take out a "dime," but you only get four cents back. When you ask them why, they turn around and run away, saying as they go, "Anyway, you're going to lose out, giving it to us is better than giving it to the ticket sellers!" The passengers then realize they've been tricked and can't help but curse, but they adopt the attitude of vegetable sellers, letting people laugh or scold, and doing what they want. They earn a few dimes to a dollar a day.

From then on, the ticket booth at the Tsim Sha Tsui ferry is quiet, but the verbal battles at the pier are even more lively than before. The ticket sellers, seeing their business being snatched away, can't help but fly into a rage. But these groups of children are all from the mischievous children's squad, accustomed to selling cakes and tea and dodging "inspectors." When the police arrive, they scatter, and the ticket sellers have no way to deal with them!

This new novelty! Finding cents to cross the sea is low-risk and high-profit. Of course, people are rushing to do it. I believe that in the near future, Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, Sham Shui Po, and even Hong Kong Island will be filled with their figures. At that time, the ticket sellers will really be caught between laughter and tears!

Any foreign national residing in Hong Kong, British subjects (regardless of nationality, anyone who has acquired British nationality or was born in British territories is considered a British subject, including Chinese or Portuguese born in Hong Kong), can join the Volunteer Defence Corps. There are no fees charged. All military uniforms, leather shoes, gas masks, weapons, and other military supplies are provided by the government.

Regular training is required once a week, in squad training, on one day of the week (the date is selected by the squad), at 6:00 PM. There is an annual winter camping exercise, held in Kam Tin in the New Territories. When the Hong Kong-based naval and air forces hold their annual winter exercises, the Volunteer Defence Corps participates in joint exercises, responsible for defending Hong Kong.

Currently, the Volunteer Defence Corps includes British, British Chinese, Portuguese, Indians, and White Russians... They are businessmen, civil servants, or employees of foreign firms and banks.

The headquarters of the Naval Volunteer Force is located on the HMS Cornflower. This ship is currently moored off Gloucester Road in Wan Chai, southwest of Kellett Island. The land office is located inside the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Building.

The honorary commander of the Naval Volunteer Force is the Governor of Hong Kong. The current commander is Colonel Beatty. The training officer is Major Herbert. The enrollment process is the same as for the Army Volunteer Defence Corps. There are currently over two hundred officers and soldiers. The headquarters of the Auxiliary Police is located in the Central Police Station, under the command of the Commissioner of Police, Henry. The current Superintendent of the Auxiliary Police is Sampson.

The Auxiliary Police organization is divided into (1) Headquarters, (2) Chinese Squad, (3) Indian Squad, (4) Police Vehicle Squad, (5) Motorcycle Squad. The Chinese Squad office is located inside the Pedder Building. The Indian Squad office and the Police Vehicle Squad office are located at 20 Ice House Street. The Motorcycle Squad office is located on Robinson Road.

The enrollment procedure is very simple. Any British subject residing in Hong Kong can join. There are currently approximately three hundred officers and constables. Some are businessmen, some are civil servants, or employees of foreign firms.

All supplies, such as uniforms, weapons, etc., and expenses are provided by the government. Those who join the Motorcycle Squad must provide their own motorcycles.

The duties of the Auxiliary Police, in addition to participating in regular training, include being under the command of the Superintendent during winter defense periods or curfews, going out to assist regular police, patrolling the streets, and maintaining law and order.

The Ambulance Brigade is the Hong Kong branch of the St. John Ambulance Brigade in the United Kingdom. The current commissioner is Morris, and the headquarters is located in the village of Tai Hang in Causeway Bay.

There are over five hundred officers, doctors, and members, divided into thirteen divisions, including the Chinese YMCA Division, King's College Old Boys' Division, Kowloon-Canton Railway Division, Indian Division, Kowloon Division, Mong Kok Division, Shau Kei Wan Division, Motorcycle Association Division, Chinese Athletic Association Division, Kowloon Youth Dining Division, South China Athletic Association Division, Wan Chai Division, and Central District Division. Each division has one or more doctors, one division supervisor, and one or more division leaders, responsible for training. Training is conducted using divisions and class systems.

There is also a female nursing corps of about four hundred people, divided into ten divisions, including the YWCA Division, Central District Division, Victoria Division, Kowloon Division, May Division, Minsheng Division, Southern Gland Division, 角 Division, Xinxiu Division, and Tao Shu Division. Each division has one doctor and one division leader, responsible for training.

Any young men and women residing in Hong Kong can join the Ambulance Brigade, regardless of British nationality. Currently, Chinese account for the majority of members, with Indians and Portuguese accounting for a minority. Most of them are students.

To join the Ambulance Brigade, you must first apply to the headquarters, which will assign you to a division to study, or you can join a division directly through the introduction of a member of that division. After several weeks of study, passing the examination, and receiving a diploma, you become a formal member of the Ambulance Brigade. The subsequent duties include participating in training, performing first aid duties at any time, voluntarily administering smallpox vaccinations and assisting health authorities in administering epidemic vaccinations during epidemics, etc.

Recently, they have also been studying air raid and gas defense, preparing to assist the community in air raid and gas defense first aid work during emergencies.

The uniforms and supplies of the Ambulance Brigade are provided by the headquarters, and no fees are charged.

The Volunteer Defence Corps, Auxiliary Police, and Ambulance Brigade are all local organizations. All three organizations are purely based in Hong Kong—the Volunteer Defence Corps is responsible for defending Hong Kong, the Auxiliary Police assists the police in maintaining Hong Kong's law and order, and the Ambulance Brigade is responsible for first aid and health work in Hong Kong society.

### Children's Welfare Association Industrial Training Institute Established; Training Children to Produce Industrial Products; Over a Hundred Students Achieving Excellent Results

To adapt to the needs of children's education in extraordinary times, the Hong Kong Branch of the China Wartime Children's Relief Association has established three children's shelters in Hong Kong to accommodate and educate children transferred from the war zone. The association, wanting to train children in industrial production skills, planned to establish an industrial training institute, but it was delayed due to financial constraints. Recently, a benefactor, Xu Rangcheng, donated funds to establish one, attached to the First Shelter. The institute opened a week ago, attached to the classroom of the Second Shelter in the old National Hospital, using the hospital canteen. In terms of management and administration, there is a supervisor and heads of various sections, responsible for promoting the institute's affairs. Xu Rangcheng serves as the supervisor, Su Hanpeng as the design director, and Zheng Chengyi as the education director. In addition, there are several male and female professors and designers, teaching sawing, planing, grinding, carving, woodworking, tailoring, wax flower making, paper art, and handicrafts. The crafts that the children learn at the institute include fabric, flowers, paper, and woodworking. Most of the products made are toys. In the flower category, there are paper flowers and wax flowers. The paper crafts include making paper boxes and toys. Woodworking products mainly consist of lifelike toys such as wooden lions and wooden horses. National defense weapons such as anti-aircraft guns and tanks are also made. There are over a hundred students, all of whom are children from the Second Shelter, mostly transferred from Hankou, aged between ten and sixteen. (乙) Those who participate in factory registration, if they belong to the factory union federation, must register at a higher fee. Those who are older learn woodworking, while those who are younger learn flower and paper crafts. The learning time is from 1:10 PM to 4:00 PM every day. The morning is study time. Due to space constraints, the institute cannot accommodate a large number of children. However, those in charge are paying close attention to expansion and have already formulated a plan to open a morning class in the future, accommodating more children, allowing them to learn crafts in the morning and study in the afternoon. After opening both morning and afternoon classes, the two classes can take turns learning crafts, and the number of students can be significantly increased, while the classroom problem can also be solved. This is truly a win-win solution.

Transportation and Travel

### A Letter from Hong Kong via Annam to Longzhou

Editor's Note: This is a letter from a friend at Sun Yat-sen University to our newspaper's reporter, reporting on his journey from Hong Kong via Annam to Longzhou, Guangxi. It is vivid and interesting. We are publishing it for our readers.

Dear ××××,

The "Zhibade" set sail at 4 PM, with a capacity for 400 people, yet only twelve passengers including us. The calculating gentlemen on board divided it into several sections: this is the dining hall, this is the meeting room, this is the reading room. They even created a dance floor in the center, turning the ship into a large hotel on the water.

The journey was smooth and calm. No one felt seasick. Compared to the situation of being splashed with pig feces in Guangzhou Bay, while not heaven and earth different, it's at least the distance from Weicheng Road to Connaught Road.

Because of the calmness, we could eat and talk. Brother ××'s preserved plums, Brother ××'s apples, and Brother ××'s oranges all went into my stomach. "Eating well and drinking in moderation" was greatly appreciated.

The first-class cabin and third-class are essentially the same. The difference is that first-class has a canvas bed and only three meals, while third-class has a bed and an extra meal. Spending those ten Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to twenty silver dollars, isn't worth it. My advice to Brother ×× when you come is that if you don't want to sit in second-class, please enter the "first-class."

We arrived in Haiphong on the morning of the 31st. The ship didn't move after docking. Someone came to take our passports, but the doctor never came to inspect. Everyone's luggage was moved onto the dock. It's best to ask a hotel to take care of it on the ship. As far as I know, the "Ertianran" Hotel is the most reliable. Once the luggage was all moved, customs officials herded us, people and things like a flock of ducks, into a large customs house to wait for inspection.

The room was dark, crowded, and the air was smelly and humid. It's best to bring some "Baifeng Dan" to avoid getting sick from the stuffiness.

Luggage inspection was extremely strict, turning everything inside out. The Annamese × is hateful. If they see something they like, they secretly stuff it into their trouser pocket. So you must watch them personally to prevent things from disappearing.

Anything new, such as clothes, fabrics, cosmetics, and medicines, will be taken away for taxation. When they take it, be sure to have them write a receipt. A student from Zhejiang University didn't know this rule, and half a box of his things was completely lost, and he almost cried.

Keep this receipt well. In the afternoon or the next day, the hotel staff will accompany you to the customs to pay the tax and retrieve your things.

This time, because the consul said a word to the customs, I was exempted from inspection, even though there wasn't anything special inside. It saved me a lot of trouble, so I consider myself lucky.

Also, pay special attention: do not bring matches or needles. One box of matches is fined 20 Vietnamese piastres. Brother ×× is a smoker, so check your pockets before going ashore to avoid adding a "red number" to your budget.

After the luggage inspection is complete, follow the hotel porter to the hotel. Be wary of pickpockets along the way, especially for your hat and glasses. One careless moment, and a "hat-snatching wind" will blow, and your "hat will be gone, who knows where." The hotel is reasonably priced, charging 1.5 Vietnamese piastres per day including food, 1 cent per piece of luggage for handling, and 7 cents for a "guild fee" for passport endorsement.

Haiphong looks no different from other places in China. In fact, there is no difference. The Annamese people, in their short gauze robes, long trousers, Daoist caps, and wooden clogs, do have a certain charm like figures in paintings. It's a pity they are thin and have unremarkable features. Compared to people who eat large steaks, drink big glasses of beer, stick out their chests, and wear leather shoes, one can draw a clear line between these groups in the world.

If customs and passport endorsement don't cause any trouble, there's no need to stay overnight in Haiphong. Take the train directly to Hanoi. The trains in Annam are smaller and narrower than those in China. First, second, and third-class have luggage cars, but fourth-class luggage must be carried with you. Therefore, taking fourth-class allows you to take care of your luggage yourself, which is also an advantage.

Compared to third-class, taking third-class is not worth it. Not only is the fare more than double, but the luggage fee is also twice as expensive, and the seats are all hard wooden boards. Why bother sitting in third-class? The luggage limit is 30 kilograms per person. Beyond that, it's calculated per kilogram based on the distance.

I took the train to Hanoi at 1 PM on the 31st, and it was after 8 PM when I arrived. Again, there were Ertianran Hotel staff to pick up guests.

I spent the New Year in Hanoi.

On New Year's Day, I strolled around Hanoi alone. First, I went to the Royal Park, where the trees and water were lush, and the scale was quite large. There were also small animals inside. An old tiger with a white forehead paced back and forth, stepping on the squares, without the "majesty of a mountain lord" and more like a schoolteacher.

Leaving the Royal Park, I went to West Lake. Hearing this name, I had some "thoughts of hometown." That day, the north wind was fierce, and the river was green and glittering, reflecting the cold light. There were neither long dikes nor tender willows, nor distant mountain mists. If the West Lake of my hometown is a virgin, then this one can only be considered a widow.

From West Lake, I went to the Sword Lake, which is in the city center. In the middle of the lake is a temple, and next to it is a dilapidated tower. The flowerbeds by the lake are lively, resembling the Guangzhou city scene. The past seemed like yesterday, and I couldn't help but linger.

This walk took two hours, and the rickshaw cost only 1 cent per hour, so the total cost was only 3 cents.

Our overseas Chinese are very powerful in business. There is a Guangdong Street, and walking through it, you almost think you're on Yonghan Road or Gaodi Street.

There is no direct train from Inner Hanoi to Longzhou. You must first go to Qiongshan or Tongdeng, then take a bus on the Longqiong Road directly.

I took a bus at 6 AM on the 2nd, arriving in Tongdeng at noon. After Haiphong, there were no more inspections along the way.

Tongdeng is a mountain village, formerly known as "Wenyuan" in Chinese. It is the border between China and Vietnam. A train station and a customs house stand isolated in the wilderness. The small market town is about half a mile away, with only two streets. Recently, because of the increased traffic, there are a few small inns.

Sitting at the entrance of the Fengjin Hotel were drivers in peaked caps, with their collars open and wearing large workman's trousers. They spoke loudly in "Shanghai dialect," surrounded by many women, like stars surrounding the Big Dipper. It reminded me of the unapproachable arrogance of the village coachmen described by Washington Irving.

The village was filled with cars of all kinds. This small mountain village had become a transportation hub. Because there were no buses to Longzhou in the afternoon, I took a stroll to Zhennanguan.

Along the way, the mountains were continuous. On the left was a steep cliff, and on the right was a valley. Walking along it felt like walking along an ancient city wall, with a sense of desolation.

About five kilometers away, I saw an antique pass standing in front of me. On the plaque in the front was Zhennanguan, and next to the wall were four large stones with the words "Important Southern Frontier" written on them by Lu Rongting. On the back of the pass was the inscription "Gongji Gate." Entering the gate was a branch office of the Anti-Opium Commissioner's Office. When the bus enters Longzhou territory, it must stop here for passport inspection.

Looking towards Annam from the pass, the mountains on the left and right extend in both directions, perfectly framing two highways. The mountains in front stand tall, like a natural barrier. Because of this majestic terrain, I thought of the industry of our ancestors, and I couldn't help but feel fascinated.

Along the way, I saw Annamese laborers with dark faces and haggard expressions, deeply showing the suffering of living under someone else's roof.

Because I was waiting for a bus, I stayed another day on the 3rd. On the afternoon of the 4th, I finally got on the Longliang bus and returned to the embrace of my motherland. Seeing every stream and every mountain along the way, I felt extra affection.

In the hazy twilight, we drove into Longjin County. The flat and wide road and the lush trees on both sides told us that Longzhou had also been modernized.

The colleagues from the Normal College and the Research Institute were still stranded on the way to Guangxi, following the school ship and had not arrived yet. Only Teacher ×× was there. After a short separation of three months, seeing each other suddenly under the dim light was truly a joyful surprise.

The next day, someone arrived leisurely. He had taken the bus ahead. Shaking hands and looking at each other felt like ten years had passed. I conveyed all of your regards, and he was extremely happy to hear them.

It has been raining continuously here for days, and it's quite chilly. The thermometer is below 40 degrees Fahrenheit, so Brother ×× and the others should not assume that the southern border is hot and abandon all your warm clothes.

Teacher × is heading to Kunming via Hanoi. We were delayed because of the bus, but we should also arrive in Kunming in a day or two.

Longzhou is not a large city, and because people are afraid of air raid alerts, the streets are deserted before 11 PM. It's practically lifeless. But prices are very high, almost twice as high as in Guangzhou, because there are too many "suffering brothers" and supply cannot meet demand.

Zhongshan Park is quite large. It used to be the place where General Fubo stationed troops. Climbing to the top of the mountain and looking up, the sea of clouds and mountains stretch endlessly. Thinking of the long and great achievements of our nation, I believe there will be a day of revival. I couldn't help but look up and sigh.

Because my heart is unsettled, I cannot sit down and write more. This letter was written hastily. I hope my old friends will understand.

A, January 9th

### Special Shipping News

### What I Saw and Heard on the Guangdong-Guangxi Route After the Fall of Guangzhou (3) Japanese Troops Invade Towns and Cities Along the West River, Guangxi Troops Move East to Strengthen the Defense Line

Troops from a certain division in Guangxi Province also moved eastward in a continuous stream to Zhaoqing to defend. The ferries and tugboats above Zhaoqing to Wuzhou are used to supply military transport, with very little space for passengers and goods. Only one ship, the Southwest, travels between Zhaoqing and Wuzhou every other day to maintain the limited transportation. A few days later, the Guangxi troops completed their deployment in Zhaoqing, making the defenses upstream of the West River more solid than before, which greatly stabilized the people's hearts. As a result, the stores in Zhaoqing gradually resumed business. However, there are air raid alerts every day, as Japanese planes constantly fly in to bomb and harass.

On November 5th, I took the Southwest ship from Zhaoqing to Wuzhou. Shortly after docking at around 9 AM, an air raid alert sounded. Five Japanese planes flew from downstream of Sanshui and attacked Wuzhou, dropping bombs on Fuhui, Jiaozui, the sulfuric acid plant, Guangxi University, and other places. As soon as the citizens heard the alert, they fled to the caves in the mountains at the foot of Beishan Mountain, Bingjingyong, and Longmu Temple. After landing, the reporter also followed the citizens to seek shelter. The Wuzhou air raid shelters were dug into the mountains, winding and circuitous. Each cave could hold fifty or sixty people, or even more than two hundred. There are about four hundred private and public shelters in the city, which can accommodate more than sixty or seventy thousand people. Such good air raid shelters are rare in the provinces and cities of South China. Is this due to the natural terrain?

The day after Guangzhou fell, Wuzhou was placed under martial law, and many defensive fortifications were added to the key passes. Then, the elderly, weak, women, and children in the city were evacuated. Because the number of refugees entering Guangxi from Guangdong was extremely crowded, the authorities temporarily exempted ships from entry inspection to facilitate the entry of refugees. However, hotels and restaurants still carried out inspections. Visitors to Wuzhou who stayed in hotels were only allowed to stay for three days. After that, they had to find a local store or relative with a job to guarantee them. The intention was probably to prevent spies. Although the population of Wuzhou was ordered to be dispersed, the number increased daily, as refugees from western Guangdong used Wuzhou as a gathering point. The market was quite deserted in the morning, but as busy as usual in the afternoon and evening, because people had to avoid Japanese air raids in the morning. Imported goods such as kerosene, yarn, matches, wool, cloth, cotton knitwear, cigarettes, and flour were one to two times more expensive than before the fall of Guangzhou. Local products such as grain, rice, pork, chicken, duck, and beef were particularly cheap. High-quality rice was only five or six silver dollars per hundred catties, pork was fourteen or fifteen silver dollars per hundred catties, and chicken was twenty-five cents per catty. This was because the downstream transportation was blocked, and the supply of local products exceeded demand, so imported goods were expensive and exported goods were cheap. However, the peasant economy was greatly affected. The transportation within the province, such as Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, Longzhou, and Baise, was not blocked, despite being busy with military transport. Although transportation outside the province was greatly affected, routes from Longzhou to Vietnam, Nanning to Beihai, and Guilin to Guangzhou Bay were still passable, but the long detour made transportation costs very uneconomical. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, Guangxi Province was under serious threat, and its responsibility for resisting the war became even greater. In early November, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai rushed from the northern front to Guilin to convene commanders and senior generals from all fronts to receive instructions. At the same time, the military and political affairs of the province were also reorganized. Where should heavy troops be stationed, which counties should be designated as security areas, who should command which route, the allocation of guerrilla units in each county, the transfer of vehicles, and the collection of military salaries and equipment all had detailed arrangements. At the same time, politically, preparations were being made to implement popularly elected county magistrates in all counties in the province in January of the 28th year. Before the popular elections, starting from November of this year (the 27th year), all county magistrates in counties bordering Guangdong and close to the war zone were to be filled by people from the original counties, such as Huaiji, Cangwu, Cen, Rong County, Guilin, and Lian County, which have already been implemented. The establishment of county councils will be limited to the end of this year. All heads of districts, townships, towns, villages, and streets under the jurisdiction of each county will be elected by the local masses, implementing a county autonomy system. All detained family members who had escaped military conscription in each county will be released from December, because the situation is so critical that the authorities hope to unite the army and the people to save the country together, so military and political aspects are being reformed. (The End)

Submissions are welcome for this column, and a small fee will be paid.

### Investigation of the Ginseng and Antler Market in Hong Kong

Ginseng and antler are both medicinal supplements. Both are famous products of Northeast China. Ginseng produced in Jilin and deer antler produced in Guandong are particularly prized. In addition, there is Korean ginseng from Korea and miscellaneous ginseng from Soviet Russia, but their efficacy is not as good as that of our domestic products. As for American ginseng from North America, its nature is a cooling agent. Antler includes deer antler, elk antler, and deer tail. The antlers sold on the market are all produced in Northeast China.

The annual trade volume of ginseng and antler in Hong Kong reaches tens of millions of dollars. Recently, due to various reasons, this number has plummeted. The decline of Donghua is the most obvious. During its peak period, Hong Kong sold four to five million dollars worth of Northeast ginseng and antler annually, but now it has shrunk to less than one million dollars. The sales of American ginseng were more than ten million dollars, but now it only recovers five to six million dollars. The sales of miscellaneous ginseng from Soviet Russia used to be eighty million dollars, but now it is only twenty to thirty thousand dollars.

About 80% of Hong Kong's antler trade is shipped to other regions, and only 20% is sold locally. In addition to Guangdong and Guangxi, Northeast ginseng and antler are sold in Southeast Asia and the old and new Gold Mountains (San Francisco). American ginseng is mainly shipped to Southeast Asia, followed by Guangdong and Guangxi. Since the fall of the four northeastern provinces, the mountains and forests are feared to harbor guerrillas. Therefore, those who enter the mountains to hunt with firearms are absolutely prohibited, and the harvesting of ginseng has also been affected. As a result, the production of ginseng and antler in the Northeast has decreased by 60% this year. In addition, due to transportation issues, trade is not easy, so the market is becoming increasingly depressed. Although the source of American ginseng is not affected, the domestic market has disappeared due to the war, and it now only relies on Southeast Asia. According to statistics, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the average loss in Hong Kong's ginseng and antler trade has been one-third.

Korean ginseng from Korea is cheaper, so its sales are very widespread. The annual sales are worth about six to seven million dollars, and most of it is shipped to Guangdong and Guangxi. Since the July 7th Incident, the Chinese people have regarded it as enemy goods and no longer care about it. Hong Kong ginseng firms and foreign companies have stopped ordering it, and all old goods stored by various firms are sealed by the trade association and sold at a discount within a limited time. Currently, there is no trace of Korean ginseng in the Hong Kong market.

### Li Hua Cup Football Preliminary Round: Army-Navy Representatives Selected Yesterday; Healy Appointed Goalkeeper; Seven Players from Middlesex Selected

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) The preliminary round of this year's Li Hua Cup is scheduled to be held this weekend. It is scheduled for 3:30 PM on Saturday, with the Army-Navy United Team playing against the Western Civilians Team at the Kowloon Football Club field in Sham Shui Po. At 3:30 PM on Sunday afternoon, the Chinese United Team will play against the Navy United Team at the Hong Kong Football Club field in Happy Valley. Both games will last for 90 minutes and will be based on a knockout system. There will definitely be very exciting performances at that time.

As of yesterday, only the Civilians Team had selected their players for the four strong teams. As for the Chinese United Team, although their players had been selected once, the Football Association felt that the selected players did not have enough appeal, which would affect the association's income and hinder the arrival of the Philippine team to Hong Kong. Therefore, it instructed the selection committee to conduct another selection and planned to invite Li Huitang to play. Based on this, the selection committee has recently conducted a new round of selection, so the Chinese United Team has not yet finalized its players. As for the Army-Navy United Teams, they had not yet been selected as of yesterday.

According to this reporter's information, the Army United Team was formed yesterday and is quite strong. What is surprising is that Pearson from the Middlesex was not selected as the center forward, but Winton from the Army Service Corps was selected. As for the selection of the goalkeeper, Healy from the Kowloon Club was already expected by this reporter. After he was transferred from the Middlesex Infantry Team to the Tak Shing Team, he joined the Kowloon Club because the Tak Shing Team did not have a First Division football team. However, as a soldier, he should return to the Army team when civilians and soldiers play against each other, and there is no other army goalkeeper who can surpass him in skill.

Judging from the current strength of the Army United Team and the Civilians Team, the Army seems to be stronger. However, the Civilians representatives are mostly from the Kowloon Club, and the game is held at the Kowloon Club field, so the Civilians have a geographical advantage. It is unknown whether this team can pose a considerable threat to the Army because of this. The list of players for the other two teams will be released later. [Old Friends of the Football Field]

### Women's Basketball Tournament: South China Fights Hard to Defeat HKU; Snowflakes Lost to Overseas Chinese; Sze Sze Crushes Paul

Three matches were held in the Youth Basketball Court last night for the Ordinary Women's Basketball Tournament. In the first match, South China played against HKU. After the start of the game, South China launched the first attack. Li Ruomei and Li Yufen broke through the defense line and repeatedly scored. In the first quarter, South China had an advantage of eight to one. HKU tried to recover lost ground. Li Huijuan, Li Zongyu, and Zou Defan worked hard to attack, but South China's defense was solid and there was no development. Li Ruomei and Li Yufen counterattacked again and continued to score points. In the second quarter, HKU was still defeated by two to sixteen. HKU changed its strategy and launched a full-scale attack. Zou Defan, Li Zongyu, and Li Huijuan cooperated with each other and made some gains. However, South China's Li Ruomei, Li Yufen, and Zhang Meiwei presented another leap. The people of Hong Kong were surrounded by enemies on all sides. In the third quarter, South China still won with a score of 26 to 9. At this time, HKU struggled desperately. Zou Defan made some gains, but South China's military power was at its peak. HKU finally lost with a score of 15 to 34. In the second match, Overseas Chinese played against Snowflakes. Chen Rongtang from Overseas Chinese returned to the battle that night, so his offensive power was stronger. He cooperated with Liu Shouguang. Although Snowflakes tried hard to lead, the strength was too different, and they willingly gave way. At the beginning of the competition, Chen Rongtang and Liu Shouguang from Overseas Chinese successively shot and scored, opening the record first. The Snowflakes sisters also worked hard to fight. Liu Qihuan and Luo Qiaobin scored, taking the first quarter with a score of 7 to 4. Seeing this situation, Overseas Chinese used all their strength and saw Chen Rongtang and Liu Shouguang launch a continuous barrage, recovering lost ground. In the second quarter, they reversed the defeat into a victory with a score of 11 to 18. Taking advantage of the victory, Overseas Chinese pressured the Snowflakes' position. Liu Shouguang and Chen Rongtang frequently made free throws. Snowflakes were in a state of collapse. After Luo Qiaobin's second attack, the situation turned around. However, Chen Huizhen from Overseas Chinese tried her best to stop the incoming troops and finished the third quarter with a score of 31 to 21. After that, Snowflakes still fought hard, but Chen Rongtang and Liu Shouguang from Overseas Chinese used a pincer attack, shooting accurately and taking a remote lead in points. After Luo Qiaobin also shot remotely, reporting back some points, the final whistle had already sounded. Overseas Chinese won with a score of 38 to 27. In the third match, Paul played against Sze Sze. After the outbreak of the war, Sze Sze's momentum was loud. Wang Huixian and Cao Bao broke through the pass and went straight to the people. However, Paul resisted stubbornly. Zhang Zhaolan and Su Man'e seized the opportunity and repeatedly built miracles. In the first quarter, Paul took the lead with a score of 9 to 8. Sze Sze changed Huang Lihe to defense because the long attack was ineffective, and the protective offensive was slightly frustrated. Huang Dongfen, Wei Bao, and Zhi Huixian divided their troops to raid and repeatedly hit several goals. Zhang Zhaolan and Su Man'e also reciprocated. In the second quarter, Sze Sze reversed with 18 to 13. From then on, the guarantee fell into turmoil. In the third quarter, she lost again with a score of 16 to 25. After that, they fought each other, and Lian, Zhun Wan, and Su Man'e and Zhang Zhaolan all made progress. However, Huang Fen and Han Huilian from Sze Sze also succeeded one after another, so they won with a score of 34 to 21.

### Inter-School Table Tennis Lingke Defeats Huanan

### Re-discussion on the Selection of the Chinese United Team for the Li Hua Cup

In response to the needs of the Football Association, the representatives of the Chinese United Team for the preliminary round of the Li Hua Cup will be selected separately.

I already have a proposed lineup yesterday, which is as follows:

Tan Junqian Luo Weiquan Hou Rongsheng Xu Jingcheng Liang Rongzhao Song Lingsheng Hou Chengtuo Zou Wenzhi Li Huitang Zhuo Shijin Chen Bingt

I believe that my purely objective proposal will be sympathetic to the selection committee.

However, it is said that Song Lingsheng's foot injury has not healed, and he may not be selected. In that case, the front line will have to be reconsidered.

If Lingsheng is really not selected, then Liang Rongzhao should be placed on the right, Xu Jingcheng in the center, and Luo Weiquan on the left. As for the left inner midfielder, Miao Huaguo must be selected.

Brother Sangyu advocates that Rongzhao play as the right inner defender and partner with Huaguo, which is also a good idea.

I believe that Rongzhao has not played this tune for a long time, and once he defends the inner midfielder, he may not perform as well as Rongsheng.

It must be known that the forward line is the backbone of the entire team. In the current situation, the Chinese United Team must strengthen the defense line to support the front line, which is the best strategy.

I still dislike Huaguo's slow movements, fearing that he will not be able to resist the rock of the Navy United Team, Armstrong Lang. However, if the low authority is to allow Lingsheng to remain in the forward line despite his foot injury, then who else can be found for the left inner midfielder besides Huaguo? But what about Chen Guangyu of the Police Force? Because he is Chinese, he is qualified to be selected, so I have another proposal as follows:

Tan Junqian Chen Guangyu Hou Rongsheng Luo Weiquan Xu Jingcheng Liang Rongzhao Hou Chengtuo Zou Wenzhi Li Huitang Zhuo Shijin Chen Bingt

Brother Sangyu also advocates using Liu Shicheng in the right forward position. If Lingsheng is indeed not selected, there is no problem with using Shicheng. However, it is still necessary to consider using Shicheng to transfer Rongzhao to play as an inner defender.

My suggestion is that because I don't trust Huaguo very much to check the right wing of the Navy United Team, I suggest that Wei Quan or Guangyu be used to play the left inner defender. I don't know if Xian Guangyu can be elected, but it is reasonable to say that he may be. (From Tai Sui of the Football Field)

### Volleyball Charity Match Terminated

The Hong Kong Female Nurses Association, facing the bloodied soldiers fighting bravely in the front and not afraid of injury, and feeling the lack of medicine from time to time, recently launched a volleyball charity match to use the proceeds to purchase medicines for use in the front. The Hong Kong University and Chinese University teams were invited to participate in the competition at that time. However, this matter was not carried out in the end. It was found that the Hong Kong Nurses Association and the Youth Special Committee of Hong Kong Journalists held a volleyball charity competition in the short term, and there was a time conflict, so this matter has been stopped.

### Film and Drama

Entertainment...The Adventures of Marco Polo

This film is based on the era of Kublai Khan in the Yuan Dynasty of our country, and tells the story of the Venetian merchant Marco Polo's business trip to China. It is a film with historical significance, but it cannot be regarded as a historical film. Because most of the plot is nonsense, we dare not believe it. The director and the director have adopted a quite serious attitude towards this film, but in order to cater to the psychology of American audiences, they reluctantly inserted some love threads, which completely destroyed the historical meaning of the film. Otherwise, the film's magnificent set, elaborate costumes, and the great and tense war scenes would have been quite successful in portraying the era of Kublai Khan in the Yuan Dynasty.

Gary Cooper plays a Venetian merchant in this film who travels all the way from Europe to Beijing. Because of his special experience with women, he wins Kublai Khan's favor and is employed, entering the palace to flirt and cause trouble. Later, when Kublai Khan goes to war with Japan, traitors cause chaos. He risks his life to ask for help, remove the traitors, and support the royal family. This possible American star presents his usual style of flirting and being suave in this film.

The heroine, Sigrid Gurie, is a Norwegian stage actress. This film is her debut on the screen. Her second work is "Algiers," which will be screened in Hong Kong soon. Although her style is completely different in the two films, she leaves us with the same perfect impression.

Empress...Boy of the Streets

Mickey's Bed Boy With the Circus

This long slapstick film, led by Tom Kealey and a group of street urchins, is a sequel to Tom's "Boy of the Streets." However, due to the story, it is obviously not as touching as the previous film. However, the director's handling of this film is very lively and interesting. Several gags are still satisfying. The various performances of the circus are very exciting. The performances of a group of child stars are very outstanding. In the end, it is still an entertaining film.

Peace...Scipio Africanus

Scipione L'africano

This is a historical film depicting a fierce foreign war in ancient Rome. The sets and scenes in the film are unparalleled. The magnificence of the palaces and temples, the bloody battles on the battlefield, the charging of tens of millions of cavalry and infantry, the crushing of war teams, and the wonders of ancient wars vividly present the wars between the two nations of that era on the silver screen. From the point of view of film art, this film is a successful work. However, because there are no familiar and famous stars as a gimmick, and it is a film from Italy, and the entire dialogue is in Spanish,

Oriental - Border Flight

Border Flight

A small-budget film with a bland story. The aerial dogfights with bandits are quite exciting and moving. Frances Farmer and John Howard's performances are mediocre.

Dahua - The Sheik

The Sheik

Starring Rudolph Valentino, a very popular star in the silent film era, known as the Great Lover of the Silver Screen. Of course, it was a very satisfying film in that era.

King Star...

### Fu Shan's National Spirit

— Qin Wen

Quan Zuwang's "Biography of Mr. Yangqu" is abridged, and this work, rich in national consciousness, is worthy of our reference. Indeed, Quan Zuwang was a nationalist writer. Composing such nationalist literature was a manifestation of his own personality, which was rich in nationalist thought. Taking advantage of Fu Shan's deeds—at the time, Ma Shiqi's biography of Fu Shan already existed—Quan Zu once again began to write a biography of Fu Shan, which was truly a glorification of the national spirit. But here, based on what Quan Zuwang wrote, we must say that it is Fu Shan's national spirit.

In the eyes of the Ming dynasty loyalists, the Manchus were foreign invaders. Those who helped foreign tribes collude with compatriots were traitors and slaves themselves. Fu Shan refused to be a traitor and did not want to be a slave, and he never cooperated with the Qing dynasty. When the Manchus entered the customs, he went into seclusion in the mountains to support his mother. Not only did he not seek glory by flattering foreigners, but no matter what, all attempts to win him over were ineffective. He was utterly rude to foreigners and unwilling to be perfunctory in the slightest. In the seventeenth year of the Kangxi era, the so-called Learned Men of Broad Erudition Examination was opened. "North of the Yellow River, none could peer into its secrets." Fu Shan's learning was good enough, and his reputation was great enough, so Li Zongkong and Liu Peixian both recommended him. Among ordinary scholars, this was considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, something to be sought after; but Fu Shan was unwilling to go. He couldn't simply refuse; the Qing government insisted that he go, so he feigned illness, and they carried him on a bed. When he reached a place thirty miles from the capital, he resisted with death and refused to enter the city. They stopped, and then officials of all ranks rushed to see him. He ignored them all, only pretending to be sick and lying in bed, regarding those who called themselves lovers of virtue as if they were invisible. Originally, those who worked under foreigners, whether high officials or big running dogs, were also big traitors and big slaves; small officials were small running dogs, and therefore small traitors and small slaves. Of course, those who understood could not bear to see this.

Among that crowd of shameless scoundrels, there was a Feng Pu who voluntarily went to the Qing government to speak well for Fu Shan, saying that Fu Shan would be given an official position without taking the examination. After the agreement was reached, he insisted that Fu Shan thank him, and he repeatedly urged him. Fu Shan resolutely refused, so they carried him away again. When they arrived at the palace, they forcibly raised him up to make him perform a ceremony, but he simply prostrated himself on the ground, never compromising in the slightest.

When Fu Shan was in seclusion in the mountains, people who admired him asked for his teachings. He said, "I study Zhuang and Lie, and I am ashamed to speak of current affairs!"

Zhuang and Lie were both recluses because they were indignant at the world. Fu Shan's statement shows his non-cooperation with foreign invaders. Someone also asked him who was the best among the scholars of the Song dynasty. His reply was, "I choose Tongfu." This is because Tongfu advocated resistance and the recovery of lost territory.

There was a loyalist named Zhang Ji who, because he refused to compromise with foreigners, excessively indulged in wine and women, gradually committing chronic suicide. After his death, Fu Shan went to hold his body and weep bitterly, saying that his death had the same significance as dying on the battlefield. This was, of course, an expression of indignation at the many who flattered foreigners at the time, and it also shows that Fu Shan held this Zhang in such high regard; that is, towards foreigners, one must at least adopt a policy of non-cooperation!

### Vietnamese Compatriots and Chinese Refugees

— Nguyen Dac Thuan of Vietnam

Since the outbreak of China's war of resistance against Japan, all of our Vietnamese compatriots have been paying close attention to the daily developments of the situation.

The cruel sounds of cannons and bombs have injured so many valiant soldiers defending their country and innocent civilians, causing us to shed many tears of sympathy!

Our scholars and intellectuals feel regret and indignation at the destruction of those ancient cities and historical sites that represent the essence of our Eastern civilization by the invaders' artillery fire. Our ordinary people, seeing in newspapers and magazines the countless innocent civilians who have been bombed in undefended cities and villages by the invaders, resulting in flesh and blood flying everywhere and suffering cruel sacrifices, feel grief and sigh, and deeply hate the inhumanity of the invaders. But sometimes we hear of China winning battles, whether big or small, and the masses feel infinite joy. This profound emotion is not a superficial, artificial display of goodwill; it is truly based on the inherent conscience of mankind, sympathizing with the weak who are unfortunately being slaughtered by the strong. It can also be said to be an expression of the justice and reason of maintaining human survival.

Because we have this precious sympathy, our Vietnamese compatriots are enthusiastic about all kinds of movements to aid China, and we are working even harder for fundraising to relieve refugees.

From December 1st to 4th, our Vietnamese compatriots held a four-day carnival in front of Albert Sarraut High School in Hanoi to raise funds to relieve Chinese refugees. Everyone participated enthusiastically, expressing our sympathy for the Chinese refugees, and also fully demonstrating that our compatriots have not forgotten the strong invasion that China suffered last year, during a time of national crisis. We are also trying our best to raise funds to repay the kindness of our great flood relief, and we must repay the goodwill of our neighboring country that helped us!

We often complain that those democratic countries that advocate peace are so weak and heartless that they sit idly by, allowing brutal invaders to commit robbery, arson, and murder in broad daylight! We only regret that we do not have the power to turn things around; otherwise, we would not allow such a cruel and inhumane act to exist!

But what we can do at present is that every compatriot should open his own pocket, donate more money, and save one more refugee from our neighboring country! Although this cannot immediately change the situation, at least we can fulfill one ten-thousandth of our human obligation to help each other in times of trouble, and we can also console the Chinese people who are in deep water, proving that only a few are brutal, and that most people sympathize with them and are doing everything they can to help them. This is the path we should continue to strive for in the future, and we hope that our compatriots will, in the spirit of human mutual aid in times of trouble, bravely advance and fight for humanity and for justice, and overthrow this common enemy of peace-loving people in the world—

### The Rushing Fuchun River Water

— Jin Zong

It was a frigid winter morning last year.

The weather was frighteningly cold, and snowflakes like flying cotton were fluttering in the gray and dim sky, as if they would never stop. Patches of floating clouds were constantly spinning, seemingly looking for a place to hide.

Everything on the earth was immersed in the atmosphere of severe winter. Apart from the desolate cold wind, the mournful sound of falling leaves, and the distant rumbling cannon fire, no other sounds could be heard.

Beneath this dim and silent sky, towering and continuous mountain peaks surrounded a vast expanse of farmland. The rushing river water flowed endlessly through it. Slender, sharp peaks, dilapidated ancient temples, wide valleys, and fertile rice fields formed a paradise of countryside, which is where my beautiful hometown, Fuyang Tingtou, is located.

The fighting on the front line seemed unusually tense. The rumbling of artillery fire grew closer and closer in the bleak and desolate atmosphere. The sounds of heavy machine guns and hand grenades could also be heard clearly. Enemy planes, like locusts, swarmed in groups, circling over this paradise, and the terrifying situation seemed to have reached its most critical point. Vigorous men's corps and self-defense groups,

in lines, stepped on the white snow, braving the cold, and marched solemnly towards the outside of the village. On the face of each of them, there appeared the great and glorious mission they were bearing.

Although my father was old, he enthusiastically went to the front line early in the morning. Although my younger brother was still young, he refused to be outdone and followed the service corps cheerfully. "The father is a hero, the son is a brave man." Both father and son felt the peril of the nation and rushed to the national crisis.

After listening to my father's exhortations, I had no choice but to accompany my elderly mother, roll up our bedding, pack our belongings, leave my hometown where I had spent seventeen winters and summers, and hire a small boat to row on the river.

The boat moved forward in the rolling waves. The sound of cannons, the sound of the wind, and the sound of oars formed a desolate symphony. The boat was small and there were many people, so we constantly felt a kind of uncertain swaying. Looking at our home from afar, under the circling of enemy planes, it seemed to be bowing its head and sighing. After a few loud noises, it was covered in a cloud of black smoke. Then, I saw a layer of blazing fire, and I seemed to hear a few faint explosions. We immediately felt a burst of tension, and emotions of anger and hatred occupied our hearts even more intensely.

Ah! The thatched huts lined up in rows, the simple houses, the sparse vegetable gardens, and the dense fruit forests will ultimately not escape ××××××××.

In the rolling river waves, the small boat gradually drifted further and further away, and everything in my hometown finally became smaller and disappeared in the rumbling cannon fire and the black smoke.

It has been more than a year since my hometown was occupied. It is said that my father and younger brother are still struggling and fighting on the front lines. May God bless them to succeed. I think that one day, my lovely and beautiful hometown will welcome us back just as brightly.

### Articles to the Front Line

— Wang Jianming

There is no need to hide the fact that our wartime cultural work, like politics, has not yet been able to catch up with the military. The slogan of "articles going to the countryside," which was proposed long ago, is still just a slogan today, and no one dares to say how far it has actually been implemented. I am not criticizing the cultural workers here, but only asking them to grasp the new political situation and quickly transition from slogans to practice.

Similarly, "articles to the front line" is not a new slogan, but according to an article published by Mr. Shen Junru in this newspaper on the tenth, "Not to mention the soldiers, even the generals often do not see a newspaper for a month and a half." As a result, the soldiers are not only spiritually disconnected from the rear, but they are also far less clear about the war they are fighting than we are in the rear. What is the situation of the war of resistance? They do not know. What is the political situation? They do not know. What is the international situation? They do not know even more. The most direct parties involved have become the most ignorant of the matter. No wonder Mr. Shen said, "We in the rear are really letting down the soldiers at the front."

Putting aside conscience, even in terms of intensifying political education for soldiers, we can no longer allow this phenomenon to continue. Can we rely entirely on oral political education for soldiers? Even if the workers are not afraid of trouble, the results will be very slow, and distant water cannot quench immediate thirst. The war will not allow you to proceed leisurely. Therefore, the written word should be placed first. It can run with the soldiers, it can increase the soldiers' knowledge in many ways, and it can answer the soldiers' questions in many ways. However, we lack this most powerful weapon.

In fact, the slogan itself does not need to be discussed. The important thing is how to implement it. In the past, there was a method of transporting books and newspapers to the front line, but "in fact, this is still empty talk, because those books and newspapers can only be sent to the adjutant's office, headquarters, and other places, and can never be sent to the hands of the soldiers on the front line." This is a fact that Mr. Shen saw with his own eyes on the front line. We cannot blame the adjutant's office or the headquarters for not sending the books and newspapers to the front line. We should review the work of those in charge of transporting books and newspapers and improve it, such as setting up close transfer stations. However, relying solely on the rear to transport books and newspapers to the front line is ultimately not enough and unreliable. It can only be used as a supplement to the soldiers' reading materials, and cannot be the main force. First, the types of newspapers are not varied; second, there are not enough copies to distribute; and third, the content cannot suit the tastes of the readers. Therefore, the best way is for cultural workers to take their pens to the front line to write articles, print them on the spot, use radio, simple printing presses, and even mimeographs. In this way, the soldiers can read fresh things, the quantity can be increased or decreased according to the number of people, and the writers, living with the soldiers, can use their language to answer their personal questions and answer the questions they urgently need to understand.

In the past, many cultural people have run to the front line, but if we want to remedy the current shortcomings and develop future work, on the one hand, we hope that those who are already on the front line will make redoubled efforts in this regard, and on the other hand, we must also call on the intellectuals and youth who are wandering in the rear to flock to the front line in large numbers. Since the defeatists have been purged, our politics has become clearer, and therefore the obstacles to our work have been reduced. We must not waste another minute of such a good opportunity.

### Jottings of a March

— Li Huiying

The quartermaster, who was in charge of the food, suddenly rushed over and shouted loudly,

"Collect the steamed buns!"

"How many does each person get?"

"Eight."

"They're so heavy."

"You'll find them useful when you're hungry."

Yes, last time we marched, we suffered a great loss because we didn't bring enough steamed buns! We walked for most of the day! We couldn't even get food, because there were no villages along the way where we could cook, and we couldn't buy snacks. We were so hungry that we just slept by the roadside and didn't want to walk. This time, we'd rather collect all the steamed buns and carry a little more on our backs than let our stomachs go hungry.

Many food bags were spread out, and many steamed buns were stuffed into them, and then, they were put on everyone's shoulders.

"Damn it, are we still going to go hungry on the road this time!"

The team set off and first walked a section of mountain trail, and then took the highway that runs through eastern Hubei, heading west to Linshan River.

The rice had already been harvested, and green seedlings had grown a foot high from the cut rice roots. Except for the flood-stricken areas, Hubei had a bumper harvest this year. The water flowed slowly in the fields, and children sat quietly fishing by the ponds.

When we reached the ancient tomb, we met Mr. Yu. We greeted each other warmly. The team had already passed. I immediately sat with him on the hillside and talked about the separation of ten days. It turned out that ten days ago, we four comrades who had been assigned to serve in the regimental headquarters became acquainted with Mr. Yu because of rest. He had originally planned to do small business in Nanjing, but because the capital was not safe, he fled back to his hometown with his family. We talked with him very agreeably, and he kept ordering his children:

"Go and add hot water." (To be continued)
