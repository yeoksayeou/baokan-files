### Travelogue of Tianjin

[Shanghai Dispatch] This reporter took the Fusheng steamer to Tianjin on the 28th of last month. Due to delays en route, we didn't arrive in Tanggu until the 8th. According to what I knew in Shanghai, in addition to the Taikoo Steamship Navigation Company ships, Jardine Matheson's passenger and cargo ships traveling from Shanghai to Tianjin could directly enter Tianjin. However, this has recently changed completely. All ships traveling north from Shanghai and Hong Kong must dock at Tanggu. All passengers must first undergo various inspections, registrations, and epidemic prevention procedures. Then, the Tanggu-based [illegible characters] military police and special agencies conduct a unified inspection, searching everyone thoroughly and meticulously. They rigorously question the passengers' backgrounds and occupations and are particularly attentive to the cash they carry, restricting each person to 500 yuan. This type of inspection was once implemented when Qingdao was connected to Tanggu. However, it seems that no large sums were confiscated on the ship I took. Tanggu is the only port of entry in North China, so [illegible characters] authorities are quite strict in their defense of the area. The two major alkali refineries and chemical companies, Jiuda and Yongli, are now entirely controlled by [illegible characters] merchants, operating on a large scale, producing large quantities, and generating significant profits. After passing inspection in Tanggu and being deemed without suspicion, one can purchase a train ticket to Tianjin. The journey from Tanggu to Tianjin Station takes only fifty minutes. Although inspections also occur at Tianjin Station, they are slightly more enthusiastic. The area near Tianjin East Station has changed significantly. Many businesses have been replaced by [illegible characters] merchants, presenting a different atmosphere. Even rickshaw pullers now wear green military-style caps. Reportedly, they have also been completely integrated under large-scale capital and are subject to unified management. They pay a monthly rental fee of four or five yuan, plus a deposit of several tens of yuan, to operate. Otherwise, they cannot solicit business. The French Concession in Tianjin is particularly prosperous. The area around Lishan and Tianzeng Lane has seen extreme commercial development and bustling activity. Various ethnic restaurants are full, with profits tripling. After arriving in Tianjin, I rested briefly and then ventured out with a friend to the Chinese districts and [illegible characters] Concessions. I then learned that the [illegible characters] Concession no longer has the bustle of yesteryear. During the incidents, most of the Chinese residents evacuated and have not yet returned. The [illegible characters] Concession authorities have cleared the area, with many residents moving out. The two most famous opium dens, Deyilou and Xinlu Inn, have moved entirely to the Chinese districts. As for the "human flesh markets" in Zhongxiao Lane and Yude Lane, they have closed due to lack of customers. Therefore, apart from a few Chinese shops established by [illegible characters], the remaining businesses in the [illegible characters] Concession are mostly [illegible characters] shops, foreign firms, and especially various military and political organizations. Zhongyuan Company has ceased operations, and there are very few pedestrians on [illegible characters] Street. Many of the buildings on the streets have been rebuilt in the Japanese style, creating a [illegible characters] Japanese island atmosphere. All intersections from the [illegible characters] Concession to the Mongolian Concession are blocked, with only one exit at the southeastern corner of the city, where pedestrians are inspected at all times to prevent accidents. The "three-no-zone" [areas where no law is enforced] in the [Japanese] Concession has returned to its usual prosperity, with opium dens, brothels, teahouses, and wine shops everywhere. Tourists are like [illegible characters], bustling and extremely lively. Dongma Road remains largely unchanged, and while business is not booming, it is still manageable. The area around Dahu Lane is slightly deserted. The area near Beima Road has always had old-fashioned shops, so there have been no changes. However, opium dens are thriving, everywhere. Sales are very brisk, and goods are sourced publicly, with the payment of unified taxes listed as a legitimate business expense. Other areas in the Chinese districts are very desolate. Residents close their doors early at night, afraid to go out. Most Tianjin newspapers rely on Tongfeng News Agency for news. Schools have mostly reopened, but there are fewer students than in the past. However, the number of schools in the British and French Concessions has increased several times over.

### Special Shipping News

The China Prince, a ship of the Taizi Yanghang [Prince Merchant House] Shipping Company, was originally scheduled to sail to Xiaoluzong [Luzon, Philippines], along the route to Bird Island, Boston, and other places today. However, due to [illegible characters], the departure had to be postponed to tomorrow. According to inquiries, this voyage will first pass through Xigong [Saigon], but will carry goods from Saigon. In addition, the large timber and [illegible characters] powder, totaling several thousand tons, transported by the Siluhua Sida [Shell-Smit] ship, an agent of the company, have now been completely unloaded. The ship entered the Kowloon Dockyard for repairs this morning.

The Xianduo Ya [Santo Andreas], a ship of the Taikoo Yan Yan Tong [Taikoo Godown & Agency Co.] has arrived in Hong Kong from Xiaoluzong and has been in the Taikoo Dockyard for repairs for nearly a month. This reporter visited the Taikoo Dockyard yesterday and learned that most of the ship requires improvement, which will take a long time. Its departure is still pending.

The Zhennabo [Jean Laborde], a ship of the French Postal Shipping Company, arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai yesterday. It is scheduled to berth at the Kowloon Wharf at 7:00 AM this morning and depart for Xigong [Saigon], Shilak [Malacca], and other places at 3:00 PM this afternoon.

The [illegible characters] President [President Grant], a ship of the American President Lines, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday via Japan from England. It was delayed by two days according to the schedule, but it is expected to arrive at 7:00 AM this morning and berth at Kowloon [illegible characters]. It will depart for Xiaoluzong [Luzon, Philippines], Xingjiapo [Singapore], various European possessions, and the United States at 1:00 PM the same afternoon.

The Kelifulan President [President Cleveland] arrived in Hong Kong via Japan from San Francisco. It is also expected to arrive this morning and depart for Xiaoluzong [Luzon, Philippines] at 5:00 PM this afternoon.

### Talking About the Automobile Transport Industry

— Ding Zuze

The American automobile transport industry has been around for twenty years since its inception. Although it is shorter than the history of other businesses, its development [illegible characters] has surpassed other transport industries to take the lead. According to reliable estimates, the total number of transport automobiles in the United States now stands at a huge number of 568,000, employing approximately one million people, which is even more than the number of railway transport workers in the United States. This shows the scale of this industry.

The automobile transport industry can be divided into two types: long-distance and short-distance. Long-distance can reach up to 700 miles, and there are several routes in the western United States around 1,000 miles. Under certain circumstances, the driving conditions are quite satisfactory. Regardless of long-distance or short-distance transportation companies, their business methods can generally be divided into two types: one is to sign contracts and fix prices periodically, and the other is to have fixed prices and fixed deliveries. To meet the needs of modern cities, the automobile transport industry is more likely to develop. The arrival or departure of ships and trains all require automobiles for transfer. The timely distribution of food, the distribution of industrial products, the demolition and construction of buildings, and the movement of large objects cannot be done without transport automobiles. Automobile transport has now exceeded railway transport, with the proportion being approximately 46% for railway freight and 54% for automobile freight. In particular, short-distance freight within 210 miles is thriving, with an eightfold increase compared to long-distance freight.

In the United States, long-distance automobile transport companies with routes over 250 miles have a large scale, and cargo handling follows railway methods. Even with a large number of vehicles, they can still make a profit. Some commentators say that large-scale companies are not very suitable for operating long-distance transport.

There are various reasons why automobile transport is so popular and developed so much. According to 35,468 businesses, the following can be listed:

Reasons　Percentage of Customers

Fast Transportation ...... 65

Can Deliver Directly to the Store ...... 65

Low Total Transportation Cost ...... 53

Can Load and Unload at the Store ...... 51

More Flexible and Convenient ...... 43

Cheaper Packaging ...... 21

Shorter Reporting Time ...... 21

Simpler Freight Classification ...... 16

Fewer Lost and Damaged Goods ...... 11

Personal Friendship and Interest ...... 3

From the above table, it is clear that most people welcome automobile transport because of its speed. According to statistics, the speed of automobile transport averages 15 miles per hour, compared to 5 miles for railways, 3 to 10 miles for waterways, and 1 to 5 miles for pipeline transport (the crude oil produced by American kerosene [illegible characters] is mostly transported to distant refineries by giant pipes). From this, it can be seen that the speed of automobile transport is three times faster than that of railways.

Another advantage of automobile transport is that the choice of route endpoints is not subject to [illegible characters] restrictions like railways or harbors. On the contrary, its endpoints are extremely flexible and extensible. As for the endpoints of large companies' automobile routes, there are also facilities such as driver dormitories, management offices, and repair shops.

In ordinary-style transport automobiles, the driver's position is about three feet behind the front of the car. Today's new-style transport automobiles have a high front, with the driver's position directly under the engine. This provides a broad and distant view, allowing the driver to be prepared for operation even in crowded downtown areas. Secondly, the cargo space is at least three feet longer than the old style. Thirdly, the weight of the load is evenly distributed on the front and rear vehicles, resulting in more economical driving.

The use of trailers in automobile transport is also gradually increasing. There are many benefits to using trailers. When the trailer is loading and unloading cargo, the truck can tow another trailer or drive to the repair shop for repairs, without interfering with the loading and unloading of cargo. Today's trailers are also very well-made. The mechanism for connecting them to the truck is extremely [illegible characters], even allowing the driver to automatically disconnect the trailer without getting out of the car. There is also a type of semi-trailer (the rear half of the trailer is equipped with wheels, and the front half is braced on the rear axle of the truck. After detaching from the truck, it can stand stably on the ground with its half-installed landing gear). Because it can be towed by small horsepower trucks, their number is also very large, especially suitable for driving on flat ground, which can greatly increase the load. The safety equipment of new semi-trailers is most commendable. Even if it accidentally detaches from the truck during driving, [illegible characters] the landing gear automatically lowers and stops automatically, avoiding the danger of overturning or collision.

"The American automobile transport industry's quick look at the business accounts and the materials for its cost calculation is quite difficult to obtain, [illegible characters] because the companies do not keep detailed accounts. Some are too busy to keep accounts and simply do not, while others only calculate the total annual income and expenses, and only conclude with some surplus. As for the accounting of large-scale companies, although it is more detailed, it is still insufficient in terms of classification and statistics. Therefore, it is difficult to investigate which vehicle parts are beneficial and which are uneconomical, so as to have a standard for future choices. Therefore, the figures listed in this article can only be used for reference and cannot be taken as the whole picture.

A large automobile transport company used a gasoline engine truck to drive on a 200-mile route, covering a total of 80,000 miles throughout the year. Each trip carried 20 tons, costing a total of $17,493, which is approximately 22 cents per mile. Another similar truck drove on a 400-mile route, covering a total of 96,000 miles throughout the year, costing a total of $19,657, which is approximately less than 22 cents per mile.

According to a survey in California, the gasoline consumption of highway transport automobiles can be listed as follows:

Load　Annual Mileage　Miles per Gallon (Note)

Under 3,000 Pounds　9,300 Miles　14.35

3,000 to 5,999 Pounds　9,000 Miles　11.46

6,000 to 7,000 Pounds　4,800 Miles　8.10

Over 10,000 Pounds　9,600 Miles　5.07

(Note) This is an American gallon, approximately four-fifths of a British gallon, or 3.75 liters.

The numbers listed in the above table cannot be compared to long-distance travel because the routes are limited to California.

Some statistics even attempt to prove that automobile transport is more expensive than railway transport over a certain mileage, but they also do not deny that automobile transport is more economical for distances of 250 to 300 miles. However, long-distance automobile transport businesses of 700 to 1,000 miles are now thriving.

The taxes collected by the American government from the automobile transport industry each year will certainly exceed $1 billion. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 1935, there were only 61,276 transport automobile companies with 188,809 trucks, and they had already collected $53,086,000 in taxes. The total number of vehicles only accounted for one-third of this year.

In short, although the American automobile transport industry is under the pressure of heavy taxes and strong competition from railway counterparts, its contribution has been very significant, such as reducing unemployment, promoting traffic convenience, and indirectly promoting the progress of automobile engineering, all of which cannot be denied.

### British Ban Forward Gold Trading　Stabilizing Gold Prices

[Reuters, New York, 5th] News of London's ban on forward gold trading surprised people here. The gold pound immediately rose to US$4.64. Foreign exchange traders believe that this move can at least temporarily curb the further [illegible character] of the gold pound. However, some people still expressed concerns about the future of the gold pound. A dispatch from Washington stated that the U.S. Treasury Department is fully cooperating with the Treasury Department to curb this speculation. [Illegible characters] steps to be taken are not yet known. It is expected that the department will use its relationship with banks and its role in controlling foreign exchange with the use of a stabilization fund to achieve this. It is said that France and Belgium have also taken similar steps.

[Reuters, London, 5th] A Reuters reporter learned from reliable sources that the British Treasury Department has requested that banks and money houses no longer speculate in gold pounds. It is said that the banks of the countries that signed the Tripartite Monetary Agreement (England, France, and the United States) have received similar requests.

### A Sad History of Chinese Commerce (Continued)

Monopolizing the Cigarette Market Again

The Chinese cigarette market, with the exception of the considerable share held by Chinese merchants, is controlled by Anglo-American capital. However, this was the pre-war state of affairs. Since August 13th, Japanese merchants, who had no position in the Chinese tobacco market, have jumped to a position of [illegible characters] great strength. Anglo-American tobacco companies and South China tobacco factories are forced to be confined to small concession areas. The vast markets in the guerrilla zone cities are all occupied by Japanese tobacco, controlled by the three major companies of "Dongya Tobacco," "Manzhou Tobacco," and "Dong [illegible characters] Leaf Tobacco."

[Dongya Tobacco Company] After the September 18th Incident, it controlled the tobacco market in the four northeastern provinces. After the fall of North China, it expanded its influence into the interior. Now, it has [illegible characters] militarily arrived in the Yangtze River basin and has successively deployed its control network as follows:

Control Network

Northeast Four Provinces Market - Manzhou Dongya Tobacco Company

"North China Market - North China Dongya Tobacco Company"

Locations of Factories - Dalian Factory, Qinhuangdao Factory

Tianjin Factory, Qingdao Factory

Jinan Factory, Xuzhou Factory

Taiyuan Factory, Shanghai Factory

[North China Factories] Most are newly established or are Chinese tobacco factories occupied by the Japanese army and entrusted to be operated. The Shanghai factory is said to have been established by purchasing Huapin Tobacco Company, a Chinese merchant, and reorganizing it. It is now rumored to be increasing its capital and planning to extend its reach to the Hankou area.

[Manzhou Tobacco Company] This company also started from the northeast and entered the interior to carry out large-scale activities. It first acquired an American tobacco factory in Tianjin, initially establishing its foothold. Then, in Beiping, it created a new factory and formed a tobacco company, naming it "North China Tobacco Company." The company's activities and structure are arranged as follows:

Control Network Northeast Four Provinces Market - Manzhou Tobacco Company

Inland Market - North China Tobacco Company

### Strengthening Far East Defenses　Britain Increases Troop Deployment to Hong Kong by Six Regiments　To Be Deployed from Huangshigong After Kowloon Barracks Are Completed　Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in China, Major General McNessey, Traveled to Shanghai Yesterday to Inspect Troops

In light of the increasingly tense situation in the Far East, the British authorities have decided to strengthen the British military presence in the Far East. Last month, Major General Doubig, Commander of British Forces in Malaya, announced this plan. Yesterday, the Asian Army Headquarters announced that it would [illegible character] troops to defend Bili [Penang]. The number of troops has not yet been announced, as the location serves as the gateway to the Xuezhou [Australia] naval base, where the British [illegible character] Pacific Fleet will be stationed in the future. In addition to the current fleet stationed in Hong Kong, the fleet will add at least two capital ships and one aircraft carrier. The British military has also decided to increase troop deployment to Hong Kong by six regiments. Once the Kowloon barracks are completed, the troops will depart from Britain and arrive in Hong Kong. The construction cost of the Kowloon barracks is said to be HK$20 million.

In addition, [illegible characters] Major General Baddowme replaced Major General McNessey as Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in China. Major General McNessey arrived in Hong Kong and took office two months ago. To inspect the British troops stationed in various parts of China, McNessey, along with his adjutant John, departed from Hong Kong yesterday morning (6th) aboard the British mail ship Laportana for Shanghai. After inspecting the local British troops, he will continue to Tianjin for inspection. He is expected to return to Hong Kong at the end of this month.

### The Hong Kong Government Will Survey Land in the New Territories to Build Large Refugee Shelters in Preparation for Refugees Seeking Refuge in the Event of War on the Border

Hong Kong Circles, the Relief Group of the Society for the Relief of Refugees from South China, held its fourth meeting at Tung Wah Hospital last night. Attendees included Lin Zengsheng of Tung Wah Hospital, Xie Huixiang of the Dongguan Chamber of Commerce, Zhou, Lu Shao of the China Youth Red Cross, Fan Luqiu of the Confucian Society, Xu Xizhe of the Huiyang Youth Association, Xi Xiuzhen of the War Relief Association, Chen Yingpei of the Comforting Association, Shan Dexin of the Young Women's Christian Association, and Liang Ruikun of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association. Li Youlin served as chairman, and Huang Shuming as the recorder.

Surveying Land to Build Shelters in Preparation

The chairman reported to the public that since the association had received the order to relocate refugees in the New Territories, the work was nearing completion. The issues of drinking water and lighting had been resolved and were being managed by Gao Naibo, so there was no need to worry. Some stations had been relocated to Shenzhen, including Sheung Shui, Man Kam To, Ha Tsuen, Lok Ma Chau, and San Tin. The relocation had already begun today (yesterday). It was estimated that while there were no fewer than three or four thousand refugees in Lok Ma Chau, only about twenty were willing to move. Regarding the safety of refugees in Shenzhen, the Hong Kong government was extremely concerned and had verbally notified Zhou Zhaowu, the chairman of Tung Wah Hospital, to survey a central location in the New Territories in advance to build temporary shelters. This was to prepare a place for refugees from the Hua Jie Shenzhen area to stay when they fled to Hong Kong in the event of war. At this time, the government already had this kind of preparation plan, so when refugees from Shenzhen came again, they could stay there. Other refugees on the New Territories border could also get a place, so they would not be as displaced and destitute as the refugees in the New Territories a month ago, exposed to the cold wind in the mountains and wilderness.

Relocation of Each Station: Three-Day Notice

Then began the discussion regarding Chen Xianxuan of Sheng Sheng Farm in Lok Ma Chau, whose enthusiastic efforts in providing relief to refugees this time. All representatives unanimously agreed that a letter of thanks should be sent to Chen in the name of the assembly. In addition, regarding the Huiyang Youth Association's request for reimbursement of the meal and transportation expenses for its New Territories service personnel, and for the purchase of equipment, totaling more than one hundred and ten yuan, it was resolved that the amount should be returned in full. The relocation of the Yuen Long station was originally scheduled for the fourth of this month, but was delayed due to the delays in the relocation of each station. The relocation of this station will not be scheduled for a specific date in the future, but a three-day notice will be given before the relocation. The public unanimously agreed to pass it. As for the remaining stations that have not been relocated, all new equipment must be clearly calculated and handed over to the relief group one day before the relocation so that it can be declared to customs. The meeting adjourned at nine o'clock.

### Vietnamese Merchant Arrives in Hong Kong to Discuss the Course of Vietnam's Ban on Arms Shipments to China. XX Threatens France to Cut Off Our International Transportation. The French Have Slightly Modified the Ban After Our Negotiations

Some time ago, the French government authorities issued an order prohibiting all military supplies and similar military supplies from being imported into the mainland from Vietnam. The reason for this has not been lifted until now and what the reason is is quite desirable for the outside world to know. According to a merchant who arrived in Hong Kong from Vietnam yesterday, he was specifically asked about it, and he agreed to tell the following what he knew. According to a certain merchant, in order to step up the blockade of our country's coastal and inland international routes to cut off our country's foreign aid, XX made a threat to France some time ago, stating that if Haiphong continued to transport arms to China, they would occupy Hainan Island and bomb the Yunnan-Vietnam railway to intimidate them. The policy of the current French Daladier cabinet is quite close to that of the British Chamberlain cabinet of today's realism, so under this only form, in order to take care of the safety of Vietnam (XX's occupation of Hainan can directly hinder the safety of Vietnam) and France's interests in the Far East, the ban was issued.

Embargo on Military Supplies

In the past, our country's government, in order to fight the Southwest war, urgently needed to develop, and transportation urgently needed assistance. In order to open up the Southwest International Route, officials were repeatedly sent to the line to propose negotiations. At the same time, the French side was also extremely reluctant to issue the ban, so after our country negotiated on the basis of reason, the ban has been slightly changed recently, and

Vietnamese Public Opinion

is also extremely dissatisfied with this measure of the French government. The reasons for this are: 1. It should not be overly shown to XX. 2. It should not give up the only opportunity to prosper Vietnam. Moreover, since the opening of the Burma Road, the Burmese authorities have publicly stated that they will help with the shipment of arms to China. This move by Burma is an even more powerful stimulus to French public opinion. Moreover, our country's success in obtaining funds from Britain and the United States has greatly changed the international situation, and it is believed that the French ban on arms passing through Vietnam can be satisfactorily resolved in the near future.

### Captain of British Ship "Dorsetshire" Suddenly Missing, New Replacement Hired

Charles, the 60-year-old captain of the British ship "Dorsetshire," suddenly disappeared on Wednesday of this week. On the morning of that day, at 3 a.m., someone saw Charles in uniform, looking out through the iron bars in front of his bedroom. This was the last trace of him. When his disappearance was heard, people generally thought that he had gone ashore, but according to the gatekeeper of the Kowloon Shipyard, no one left the dock in the middle of the night that day. Also, all the clothes in Charles' room were still neatly arranged, and his bed curtains were also lowered. He was wearing a uniform when he disappeared, and there were no suspicious traces. The ship left Hong Kong for Gijon the day before yesterday and hired a new captain named Doubia. All of Charles' clothes were sent ashore.

### Frozen Corpses on the Road! The Weather Suddenly Turns Cold, Over Forty Degrees Yesterday Morning, The Coldest Since February Last Year

The weather has suddenly turned cold in recent days, and it has been raining lightly, and the overcast weather has added to the chill. According to the Observatory's report yesterday morning, yesterday morning was one of the coldest days since last winter. It is estimated that from 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. this morning, the Fahrenheit thermometer suddenly dropped by more than ten degrees, falling to 49.9 degrees, breaking the record of below 50 degrees after February last year. Most of the poor residents who did not have cold clothes were huddled on the streets, and some old, weak, and disabled people even froze to death on the roadside. The charitable organizations and philanthropists in Hong Kong should be moved by this, but do they have any thoughts? The weather records from 2 p.m. the day before yesterday to 9 a.m. yesterday are listed below: 2 p.m. the day before yesterday: 58 degrees, 5 p.m.: 54.5 degrees, 7 p.m.: 54.1 degrees, 9 p.m.: 52.7 degrees, 11 p.m.: 52 degrees, 1 a.m. yesterday morning: 51 degrees, 2 a.m.: 50.9 degrees, 3 a.m.: 49.9 degrees, 4 a.m.: 50.7 degrees, 5 a.m.: 51 degrees, 6 a.m.: 51.3 degrees, 7 a.m.: 51.4 degrees, 8 a.m.: 51.3 degrees, 9 a.m.: 51.5 degrees, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.: 50 degrees to 54 degrees.

### Prolonged Drought Causes Sharp Decline in Hong Kong and Kowloon Water Storage. Although Residents Strive to Conserve, It is Far From the Level of the United States. Current Water Storage is 185 Million Gallons

Hong Kong's rainfall last year was abnormally scarce, making it the most arid year in more than forty years. The water storage situation in various reservoirs has been of great concern to the general public. According to an announcement by the Hong Kong Water Authority yesterday, as of the first of this month, the total water storage of various reservoirs in Hong Kong Island was 135,238,000 gallons, compared to 165,524,000 gallons in the same period last year. The total water storage of various reservoirs in the Kowloon Peninsula was 185,329,000 gallons, compared to 284,271,000 gallons in the same period last year. As for the consumption situation, taking December last year as an example, due to the implementation of water rationing, the daily supply time was only 8 hours, so the increase in the number of difficult people and the amount of water consumption decreased. It is estimated that in December last year, there were 550,000 people in Hong Kong and the Peak area, but the total water consumption was only 34,741 gallons, with an average daily water consumption of 20.4 gallons per person. In the same period of the previous year, there were 445,000 people and the total water consumption was 42,131 gallons, with an average daily water consumption of 30.5 gallons per person. In the Kowloon Peninsula, in December last year, there were 900,000 people, and the total water consumption was 24,059 gallons, with an average daily water consumption of 15.5 gallons per person. In the same period of the previous year, there were 380,000 people and the total water consumption was 25,399 gallons, with an average daily water consumption of 20.6 gallons per person. In terms of the above-mentioned storage situation and water consumption situation, residents have tried their best to conserve water, but the amount of water stored in the reservoirs is still not as good as in the past. This is probably because the total rainfall in Hong Kong last year was fundamentally lower than in the previous year. It is estimated that the previous year received 82.5 inches, while last year only received 55.35 inches, a huge difference. The table of water storage in each reservoir as of the first of this month is listed below:

Hong Kong Island

Tai Tam Reservoir 251.44 Million Gallons

Tai Tam Byewash Reservoir Not Detailed

Tai Tam Middle Reservoir 21.31 Million Gallons

### Guangdong Relief Committee Actively Working. Chen Pishi Sent to Hong Kong for Fundraising. Mainland Lacks Medicine, Hope Overseas Chinese Will Donate

Chen Pishi, President of Hong Kong National News Agency, was recently appointed by Zhang Jian, Director of the Guangdong Relief Committee, as the representative of the Committee in Hong Kong, responsible for fundraising matters. After Chen was appointed, he has been actively working. He told reporters yesterday that Guangdong has now become a very important battlefield. From now on, medical relief matters will be centralized to achieve the effect of command and control. The Guangdong Relief Committee will be the central organization for handling these matters. The service personnel and medical supplies are extremely lacking. We should mobilize to ensure that the wounded and sick receive the most complete diagnosis and treatment. The Japanese invasion has fundamentally broken the boundaries between the military and civilians, who are all suffering from oppression. Therefore, all medical relief matters are handled in a unified manner. The Committee has several battlefield rescue teams serving on the front lines, including the International Red Cross Rescue Team and the Chinese Red Cross Rescue Team. The Committee is currently located in Shaoguan and has established twelve battlefield hospitals. The Committee has now dispatched Chun Lin and Li Jingguo to assist the Hong Kong office in handling all matters. The office address is currently being actively searched for. Before the address is determined, if all sectors have any business dealings, please contact Chen at Room 319, 319 Princess Street, Central Avenue (telephone 2794).

### Official from British Ministry of Health Arrives in Hong Kong to Inspect Pharmaceutical and Medical Organizations in the Far East, Sir Nahan Arrived in Hong Kong the Day Before Yesterday

Sir Neville, a famous British doctor, arrived in Hong Kong the day before yesterday from Singapore on the "Shunapotan" with his wife. Sir Neville's trip to the East this time is to lead the British government's health inspection of British medical research organizations in the Far East. When he visited Batavia on his way to Hong Kong, he inspected the local new-style hospital and compared the methods of lovers. He will stay in Hong Kong for several days and will leave Hong Kong on the Carthage on the 21st of this month. During his stay in Hong Kong, he will be treated with great courtesy by the deputy superintendent. Sir Neville inspected the medical department of Hong Kong University five years ago under the order of the British Ministry of Health. This time, he is glad to hear that the school has made great progress. He also has his own unique viewpoint during the inspection. After the inspection is completed in the future, he will prepare a report to the British Ministry of Health.

### The New Travel Group, a Symbol of the Rebirth of the Chinese Nation

– Qi Zhuo

A child wrote "A Record of the Establishment of the Society for Life Education"

The day before yesterday, on a refreshing morning, the reporter visited Mr. Tao Xingzhi at his residence again. As if he had received an unexpected harvest, Mr. Tao presented a copy of "A Record of the Inaugural Meeting of the Society for Life Education."

The content of this record is vivid, lively, sincere, and interesting, and it is clearly a material worthy of attention.

What excited us most was Zhang Changjun, who took notes on this record. When Mr. Tao introduced Zhang Jun and the Xin'an Travel Group to the reporter, he fully expressed his happiness and joy. The reporter was also deeply moved and filled with infinite expectations for the little masters of the new China and the future of the Chinese nation.

It turned out that the child Zhang Changjun was a member of the Xin'an Travel Group and was only sixteen years old. His intelligence and ability make our generation of adults feel very ashamed!

Tong Chang is one of the many outstanding little friends trained by the Xin'an Travel Group. It is also necessary to report on this well-known and brand-new children's organization in our country to comfort the overseas Chinese who care about the motherland.

The Xin'an Travel Group constantly works and learns, practicing the credo of "Life is Education" and "Society is School." Its nature is a traveling school and a work group. When the Suiyuan War broke out, the group launched amazing work and won attention and admiration at home and abroad. After the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident ignited the flames of war, the group's long march in the great era became more active. Propaganda, condolences, fundraising, official propaganda, drama, guiding children, organizing children, promoting cooperation between the military and civilians, and promoting the national salvation movement... all showed remarkable achievements. Their footprints have covered eleven provinces and completed a long march of more than 20,000 miles. Wherever they passed, they sowed "new ladders" and assisted the military and political authorities, and grew up in real life. They are indeed creating a bright new page for history.

It is found that there are more than 40 children in the group, the youngest is only ten years old, and the oldest is only sixteen or seventeen years old. All the organization and activities are designed and cooperated by the children themselves. Mr. Wang Dazhi is their advisor, but he is only limited to being an "advisor" and not a commander. When the Society for Life Education was established in Guilin on February 15, the group happened to be in Guilin, so they all participated, and the child Tong Chang actually wrote a vivid and enthusiastic record. The Political Department of the Military Commission has now specially invited the group to work in the northwest provinces. They also specially invited the Shanghai Children's Theater Troupe to work in the southwest provinces. These two new children's groups are equally valued by the authorities and compete with each other.

"Who says we are young?" The new masters of the new China have grown up in an era of suffering.

The full text of the record of the establishment of the Society for Life Education recorded by the child Tong Chang was originally published in this newspaper yesterday. Due to typesetting reasons, it had to be slightly delayed. Also, because the original text was lengthy, only the essential parts are excerpted as follows:

Excerpts from "Record of the Establishment of the Society for Life Education": Recorded by Chang of the Xin'an Travel Group.

After Wuhan and Guangzhou were abandoned, and the central government made new arrangements for the second phase of the War of Resistance. The air in Guilin was in a new harmony. The Society for Life Education, which had been fighting for the new education cause in China for twelve years, was officially established in Guilin under the advocacy of the Guangxi authorities.

The inaugural meeting was held at the Guangxi Provincial Government on December 15. About 1,500 members and guests attended.

Mr. Tao Xingzhi, who had been separated from his Guangxi compatriots for several years, gave a concise report on the life education over the past twelve years:

Representatives from the Guangxi Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Department gave speeches. Qiu, Director of the Education Department of the Provincial Government, also earnestly said:

"The four types of educational movements that the Society for Life Education has strived for in the past are very beneficial to the country. They have all been done in Guangxi. Recently, Mr. Tao dodged XX aircraft and gave us a suggestion for "Cave Education." This suggestion is very good. We have already started doing it and plan to expand it as a plan for Guangxi's Adult Education Year next year?"

The meeting passed the charter and thirty-three directors and fifteen supervisors. There were actually only thirty-three directors, because Mr. Tao said: "Our directors and supervisors should have representatives from all ethnic groups. Mr. Tang Gou San is a representative of the Hui people, and Mr. Xi Rao Cuo is a representative of the Tibetan people, but there is no representative from Mongolia yet. We believe there will be one soon, so we will leave a name blank…" Among the fifteen candidates for supervisors, one was Zhao Hongwenguo (i.e., Old Mrs. Zhao). This old lady represents the Manchu people on the one hand, and although she only knows four words, she is the mother of the Chinese guerrillas and a most loyal practitioner of life education, so she was also elected as a supervisor.

People suddenly stood up, and three thousand eyes suddenly focused on the left doorway of the auditorium, followed by a burst of thunderous applause. It turned out that General Bai Chongxi, who had fought all over the country and was admired by the world, had arrived!

The chairman said excitedly: "Now please invite Deputy Chief of Staff Bai to speak."

Clap clap clap… clap clap clap… General Bai said calmly:

"What I am talking about today is 'Total War and Total Tactics.'"

"…Our War of Resistance against Japanese XXism is a war of national revolution, so it should be a total war. Tactics must be coordinated with the war, so we should have total tactics…

"How should this kind of battle be fought?

"What is studied in ordinary schools is regular warfare, which is a military comparison of equal equipment and equal technology. The battles in the situation above are not found in medicine, not found on maps, and teachers have not invited us to learn them in school. -- I personally have never learned it.

"We can only create new tactics from experience. What are the new tactics? They are total tactics that comprehensively use evasion warfare, mobile warfare, and positional warfare. …"

General Bai spoke very correctly and decisively, giving a good explanation of life education from the process of total tactics.

Finally, General Bai felt that the Chinese War of Resistance would take at least three years to win: "Some people may think, 'Ah, there are still eighteen or nine months!' But I want to tell them that when we were in the revolution of 1915, we fought against the Northern Warlords for two years. Now we are fighting against such a brutal Japanese XXism in the world. I say at least three years. Is the price still high?"

Occasional humorous interjections caused laughter in the hall. The applause lasted for three minutes. Everyone automatically stood up to pay their respects until General Bai walked to his seat.

Mr. Tao stood up to thank him and said:

"Just now, Deputy Chief of Staff Bai said: The new tactics are the total tactics of comprehensive use of guerrilla warfare, mobile warfare, and positional warfare. This is a truth. Similarly, one of the five principles announced by Chairman Chiang at the Hengshan Conference is to emphasize guerrilla warfare. One of our educational responsibilities is to publicize the truth, and we should let everyone know the truths stated by Chiang and Bai. But teachers also have a responsibility to refute XX."

The three songs sung by the children of the Xin'an Travel Group received a warm welcome, especially when the children innocently sang "Think about it, it's still a bastard," the audience applauded again. General Bai laughed happily and shook the hands of the five or six children to help him clap.

Mr. Tao, an educator and public poet, came out with a smile again:

"Now it is a total war of resistance. Military men should be cultured, and women should be armed. I just wrote a short poem: "Literati are militarized, military men are cultured, neither literary nor military are cultured. Literati and military men no longer scold each other, but unite to create a new world!" Now, please invite Guo Moruo, the leader of the Chinese literary world and armed, to speak." (Laughter, applause.)

Mr. Guo walked up slowly, and he couldn't help but smile. The demeanor of an orator and the heroic posture of fighting were gone. He was melting into the pleasant atmosphere full of children's vigor.

"After Mr. Bai spoke, the children from the Xin'an Travel Group and the Zhongshan Memorial School performed in front of everyone. I feel ashamed when I see it.

"There is a saying in China that 'each generation is not as good as the previous one.' Today, after seeing the activities of the children, I deeply feel that 'each generation is not as good as the previous one.' What the ancients meant was that later generations are not as good as previous generations, but what we see today is that 'each generation is not as good as the previous one,' which means that the previous generation is not as good as the later generation!" (Applause)

"Just having this point is enough to prove that the final victory must be ours. I am not very clear about other children's groups. I am relatively clear about the Xin'an Travel Group and the Children's Theater Troupe. The Xin'an Travel Group started from Jiangsu before the War of Resistance. It has already traveled 30,000 miles and left a deep impression in the northwest. When we came back to the south this time, we saw how organized and hardworking their work was!

"The Children's Theater Troupe was organized in Shanghai after the War of Resistance. After Shanghai fell, they ran out and did a lot of work from Nantong Zhengzhou to Wuhan. This is something everyone knows.

"Who created the Xin'an Travel Group and the Children's Theater Troupe? They were all created by Mr. Tao, our Chinese 'Pestalozzi'."

"Life education emphasizes practice and inspires consciousness and creativity. It is to closely link education and life, so there is also the slogan 'Life is Education' and 'Society is School.' The children have practiced this principle and principle, which is different from the people of our previous generation. The Xin'an Travel Group and the Children's Theater Troupe are the embodiment and specimen of life education!

"Recently, the Political Department has determined two principles for propaganda work: 'Propaganda is education' and 'Service is propaganda.' It can also be said that it is imitating Mr. Tao's 'Life is Education' and 'Society is School.' The determination of this propaganda principle is the result of twelve years of hard work in life education, and it can also be said that it is the more than a year of the War of Resistance that made us feel that we need life education.

"Now the children are in front of you all. How pure and brave they are. I hope that everyone can be like these children and create a pure and flawless "New China!" with a pure and flawless spirit. (Applause)

"Mr. Guo also told us a truth: "Learn from the children"!"

The Shanghai National Salvation Drama Troupe's second team's "Escape to Guilin" was performed under the leadership of Jin Shan and Wang Ying, earning a lot of laughter and tears. When the meeting was dismissed, General Bai was surrounded by friends again. Some of the children wrote down his speech and asked him to revise it. Some of the children surrounded him and asked him about the war. He asked the children of the Xin'an Travel Group about the situation in the Northwest. He asked, "Were you there when I went to Ningxia in the spring?"

Finally, he told the children: "I work at the XX School on XX Street. You can come and find me tomorrow."

When the lights came on, the majestic general and the innocent children said goodbye enthusiastically.

### Illness in Hong Kong

— Yu Huan

Those who have lived in Hong Kong for a long time all know: "Being sick in Hong Kong is a terrible thing!"

Being sick is, of course, a miserable thing. It is also a miserable thing to fall ill there. What kind of illness in Hong Kong is particularly terrible? Let me tell you the facts—

There are too many doctors in Hong Kong, especially now. In the past, there was already a saying in Hong Kong that "there are more doctors than patients"; now there is another group of Chinese and Western doctors who have fled from Guangzhou and other places to practice as refugees. So the number of doctors has increased a lot! But even though there are many doctors, it doesn't feel easy to get medical treatment. We know that the consultation fee for an ordinary Chinese medicine practitioner is one dollar, while for a Western doctor it is two or three dollars. If you invite them to your home, a Chinese medicine practitioner charges three dollars, and a Western doctor charges five dollars. The fees double in the early morning and evening, double for long distances, and increase again for crossing the sea. If an ordinary person is sick, they go to a Chinese medicine clinic, and it costs at least one dollar for the consultation fee and more than one dollar for the medicine, totaling at least two or three dollars. If you invite a doctor to your home to take your pulse, it costs five or six dollars a day. Going to an internal medicine clinic, including consultation fees and medicine, costs at least five or six dollars a day. Inviting a Western doctor to your home costs at least ten or eight dollars a day.

Assuming the illness heals in seven days, it will cost more than twenty dollars to go to a Chinese medicine clinic, and thirty or forty dollars to invite a Chinese medicine practitioner to your home. It will cost thirty or forty dollars to go to a Western medicine clinic, and sixty or seventy dollars to invite a Western doctor to your home.

The above figures, in Hong Kong where the cost of living is increasing day by day, pose a very serious threat to the general wage-earning class or small business owners. For someone who earns one hundred dollars a month, if unfortunately someone in their family falls ill, spending thirty or forty dollars, or forty or fifty dollars, is a major blow to their finances. It is even more unimaginable for the laboring masses with lower incomes. They certainly cannot afford the above methods, and the result is only as the saying goes: "If you have money, you can afford to treat the illness. If you have no money, you have to risk your life." If poor people get a serious illness, they can only die—

The medical expenses mentioned above are only for ordinary Chinese and Western doctors with some reputation. The fees are even more than this amount. I know that some famous Chinese and Western doctors charge five dollars for a house call and one dollar for a consultation, with double fees for long distances... Recently, some even charge twenty dollars for a house call, five dollars for registration, and thirty dollars for a consultation... As for famous Western doctors, they charge each other five dollars for a house call and ten dollars for a consultation, and some even charge fifty dollars to come to the door late at night. In such cases, it is really not easy for people who are sick in Hong Kong to seek medical treatment!

Even if you are a wealthy person, you may still not be able to meet the demands if you encounter a doctor who does not treat you well. This is a true story. I have a friend who went to an eye doctor, examined his eyes, spent ten dollars, and got back a bottle of sour water.

You might say that there are also government-run, public, and church-run hospitals, but you must know that there are only a dozen hospitals in Hong Kong and Kowloon, while the population of Hong Kong and Kowloon exceeds one million. The supply is far from meeting the demand!

Hospital costs are also not low. In ordinary public or private hospitals, the top-class rooms cost more than two to more than twenty dollars a day, including medical expenses. Middle-class rooms cost ten or eight dollars, and the cheapest rooms cost three or four dollars - although there are also rooms that cost fifty cents, but due to various reasons, those who can afford to pay for it also live in the more expensive rooms.

Speaking of the so-called "private hospitals," although they are better, the costs are shocking. Hospital fees, medical fees, medicine fees, meal fees, accommodation fees for the caregiver, and even some flowers and alcohol are also charged for. A friend went to the hospital for six days, and when he was discharged, the administrator gave him a bill for more than four hundred dollars. He could only shake his head and sigh after looking at it.

Hospital staff cannot completely eliminate discrimination based on the patient's room level and the amount of tips given. Many are impatient when serving, scolding patients, and are sloppy in their work and unwilling to do their best... All of these are very regrettable things about hospitals!

There are too few charitable hospitals established by charitable organizations. Even when patients are exposed to the sun or undergo other procedures, there are no "nurses" to take care of them. As a result, very dangerous incidents occur because patients are not cared for and instruments are not managed...

Don't mention the free medical and pharmaceutical organizations, because there are too many people seeking medical treatment; doctors are too busy, and there are not enough administrators... so there are perfunctory things happening. I have witnessed that in five minutes, a male doctor continuously examined six patients.

The doctor's time on duty is probably very short, right (?) There are too many patients, right (?) It is often difficult to find a doctor immediately when a patient is in critical condition...

What is the patient's sin? They suffer from the pain of illness, the loss of money, the pain of oppression, and the pain of poor treatment!

This is the truth: "Being sick in Hong Kong is a terrible thing!"

Free Talk

### Zhou Zuoren and Lu Xun

— Lin Huanping

Reading the newspaper of the fourth of this month, I learned that Mr. Zhou Zuoren was seriously injured in an assassination attempt by two young men at his residence in Beiping on the third. Amidst the waves of the Wang Jingwei case, it is another matter that has attracted attention.

Although Zhou Zuoren is the younger brother of Mr. Lu Xun, the two took completely opposite paths. Mr. Lu Xun firmly advocated resisting Japan in order to achieve national freedom and liberation. Therefore, even though he is dead, when people talk about the war of resistance, they think of Mr. Lu Xun; when they talk about Mr. Lu Xun, they also think of the war of resistance. Mr. Lu Xun is a national soul respected by generations, but Zhou Zuoren is different. This old man who drank "bitter tea" in the "Bitter Rain Studio" for ten years was so confused when the Japanese occupied Beiping that he talked about "revitalizing Chinese culture!" with the ethnic aggressors.

I remember that a group of people in Japan who liked to study Chinese literature organized a "Chinese Literature Research Association." They published an official magazine called "Sino-Japanese Literature" (please note that they did not use "Shina" or "Shina Literature"). In one issue, they published articles by the Zhou brothers and included an illustration. Beside the drawing, the brothers seemed to each have a poem. I don't remember clearly, and I don't have their works on hand to check, so I can only leave it at that. As for that illustration, it depicted: a tall tower, with Mr. Lu Xun sitting at the top of the tower, leading the general literary movement. Below the tower was a small river, and a small wooden bridge was built over the river. On the bridgehead on the opposite bank, Mr. Zhou Zuoren, riding a white horse, could not cross the small wooden bridge. Now, this "bitter tea" master who rides a white horse not only cannot cross this small wooden bridge, but also walks in the opposite direction - riding a white horse and raising a white flag, walking into the enemy camp.

In the early days of the May Fourth New Literature Movement, the Zhou brothers were both literary giants. Their achievements during that period, from a cultural and literary-historical point of view, cannot be denied. It is a pity that Zhou Zuoren did not understand the development of history and social change, could not resist the torrent of the times, and the practical struggles. When Mr. Lu Xun stepped forward, leading progressive cultural figures and progressive writers, for truth, for justice, for resisting the dark forces, and for fighting hard for the future of the Anti-Japanese War, Zhou Zuoren escaped reality, hid in the "Bitter Rain Studio" to drink "bitter tea," enjoying leisure and not asking about worldly affairs. What's even worse is that in his mind, he may have been ironically criticizing Mr. Lu Xun's "busyness" in an Ah Q manner. From that time on, Zhou Zuoren's progressive significance disappeared, and he had already put on a negative shield and become a historical figure. About three years ago, the Japanese House of Peers member, Japanese nationalist scholar Sanzue Mikami, gave a shameless speech in the parliament, saying that China should not be called the Republic of China, and that Shina was the name of China. I remember that Zhou Zuoren wrote a long article scolding him. At that time, we were very pleased that he still retained some of the "May Fourth Spirit." Unexpectedly, two years later, he actually talked with the aggressors about "revitalizing Chinese culture," believing that the Chinese people could not recognize the benefits of Japan unless they went to Japan - this is really regrettable, but it is also the inevitable conclusion of "drinking bitter tea." Literary figures who are shaken and afraid of struggle and political figures who are shaken and compromise and are afraid of struggle are no different.

### Under the Setting Sun

— Wan Yu

Unacquainted friend, you should remember: when you first came to this place, it was at dusk when the sun was setting; this dusk was beautiful, mysterious, and intoxicating. Isn't it? The colorful sunset glow in the sky is reflected on the walls of the small Western-style houses built of glass stone, blending a mysterious color that cannot be found in paintings of the Greek era.

In the past, within this realm, boundless sweet affection reflected endless beautiful scenery; the woman in the glass stone small Western-style house, Bei Bei, was a charming woman, like a peony, like a peony. Every day, wearing a glamorous evening dress, she stood by the small flower garden in front of the door, gazing at the colorful clouds in the sky, as if it were an uninterrupted habit. Her captivating eyes and smile would attract the attention of passers-by, and car drivers would also cause accidents because of her.

However, after you came, this dirty, withered, and tattered appearance destroyed the entire beautiful realm. The so-called destruction is that the charming Bei Bei has hidden herself, perhaps afraid that the foul smell all over you will make her vomit. But I, when I passed this place as usual that evening, like appreciating a precious painting, was attracted by you, this sudden embellishment.

My intention was that adding a dirty and tattered you to such a magnificent and mysterious scene, if this were really a painting, then the meaning contained in this painting would indeed be rare.

But I never thought that this imaginary appreciation would lead to another kind of problem:

Thick black eyebrows, bright pupils, long ears, straight nose, these marks on your face have been imprinted in my mind for a long, long time: However, from what place did I capture such an intimate image for you? Back at my residence, I couldn't sleep that night because of you. I blamed myself for being forgetful, and I resented my poor memory.

The next morning, I passed by you again, and you were already lying on the sidewalk, your body covered with a straw mat, and the straw mat was shaking slightly. I thought you must be unable to resist the cold in the air; were you shivering? Even if you were physically strong, you would inevitably be attacked by illness, right? Who knew that you really got sick because of this: from then on, you were unable to struggle to get up, and all day long you seemed to be half-asleep, always silently looking at the gate of the glass stone small Western-style house with a pair of bright pupils. You didn't shout, you didn't groan, and at the same time you didn't seem to be hungry or thirsty. Time slipped by day by day, and the glory of the setting sun shone on your bed again and again, quietly, always quietly.

The charming Bei Bei, hidden deep in the small Western-style house, also quietly disappeared. The apple green Austin parked in the garage, and its loud horn also fell silent.

However, the question that hangs in my heart is still unresolved; I know you, but I forgot the time and place we met.

Just as I was about to put it aside as a "mystery," the sealed gourd was opened:

On the last day, I went to Avenue Joffre and passed the door of a foreign photography studio, and a photo placed in the glass window recalled my memory; it turned out that the image left in my mind was this photo, and the face in the photo was you; thick black eyebrows... a romantic and handsome expression, smiling at passers-by.

In order to solve a heavy case, I pushed open the glass door of the photography studio. I foolishly hoped to find your secret from the mouth of any member of the photography studio. Although I was disappointed, I discovered a miracle here. What is it? Among the many colored enlarged sample photos hanging on the walls of the photography studio, there was also a picture of you, and beside you was a charming woman. I took a closer look, what? The woman turned out to be Bei Bei, the hostess of the glass stone small Western-style house - I suspected that I was dreaming, but in fact I was not in a dream.

So I suddenly realized it, like a detective cracking a case. I hurriedly took a streetcar back, wanting to comfort you a few words, no, or maybe to find some writing material from your mouth. Where could I find you? When I came back, you were gone, you had left the world, and the remaining corpse was taken to Pushan Mountain Villa for burial.

Looking at the wet marks on the ground, a layer of melancholy floated in my heart.

You were young, you were brave, the times needed you, but you unexpectedly misused your spirit of battle, and now you have died in this "battlefield!"

Evening has come again, and the glory of the setting sun shines on the small Western-style house of glass stone as usual, because the charming Bei Bei comes out to stand idly and gaze as usual, so the environment here still restores the beauty and mystery of the past. Your death has not had the slightest impact on this place.

That being the case, if you have a soul and are conscious, I hope you repent, repent forever!

### The Enemy of Women

— Xia Sha

Last week, I read in the newspaper that Hitler had established an association to reward mothers for giving birth, and had newly ordered various medals. Women who gave birth to many children could receive bronze, silver, and gold cross medals respectively, which they could wear on their chests, indicating that they had "contributed to the country." At almost the same time, Mussolini also shouted loudly: "War is to mankind as childbirth is to women." These two sworn fascist brothers, singing in harmony, are truly "theoretically profound" and have "a way to have children."

Turning through history, we can't find anyone who has destroyed and slaughtered women more than Hitler and Mussolini. They are truly the number one "public enemy" of women all over the world!

In order to establish a (brown) Third Reich, in order to restore the glory of the ancient Roman Empire, and especially in order to protect the pockets of the oligarchic financial capitalists at home, they did not hesitate to provoke a destructive war, and did not hesitate to push batches of women working in society back home - especially back to bed, implementing the so-called "contribution to the country" of giving birth; turning women's sacred duty of perpetuating the human race into machines for mass-producing cannon fodder. Unexpectedly, under the arrangement of the brown Prime Minister and the black-shirted dictator, a small fascist family - perhaps in the bed tent - is also filled with the air of "war permeating!"

According to these two benevolent brothers, it seems that the more children women have, the more they "contribute to the country"; then giving birth to at least a dozen children, and giving birth twice a year like a "sow," should be worthy of admiration and learning. Perhaps Hitler and Mussolini are mobilizing a large number of scientists to study the "sow's childbirth method" in order to implement the "sow's policy" in the future. If one day they succeed in their research and put it into practice, then wouldn't every woman in Germany and Italy appear in the posture of a "sow?" This is naturally "contributing to the country" and should be given the "Gold Cross Medal."

If this kind of "new maternal type" really appears in fascist countries, how ashamed and embarrassed should women all over the world be - is a woman really just a "reproducing animal" and a "machine for manufacturing cannon fodder?"

For their own freedom and happiness, and for the justice and peace of mankind, I believe that women all over the world should unite, regardless of nationality, to extinguish these two "enemies of women" and overthrow this pair of fascist fellows who have distorted female morality!

### National Crisis Fortune

No matter how skilled you are in reading the Eight Characters of Destiny or how proficient you are in studying the Physiognomy, you would never have thought that in addition to "legitimate wealth" and "unexpected wealth," there is also "national crisis wealth" at present.

It is said that "legitimate wealth" is the income from one's own work; "unexpected wealth" is an unexpected and lucky gain; the former is legitimate, and the latter is a fluke. In the eyes of those who know their destiny or are discerning, these are all destined or born with, and cannot be forced or sought after. Let's leave that aside. Who knew that during the Anti-Japanese War, many people started to make "national crisis fortunes," causing Dr. Ma Yinchu to petition the government to arrest and punish them. If Mr. Ziping and Taoist Ma Yi knew about this in the underworld, they would surely thank Dr. Ma for correcting the erroneous astrological views of the general public, right?

Indeed, those unscrupulous elements, disregarding shame, willingly flattered the enemy, and took the opportunity to collude with a group of vagrants, engaged in various acts of sabotage against the war of resistance, and profited greatly from it. Their wickedness is greater than the enemy, and they are indeed guilty and deserve to be punished. If they are tolerated, the country will suffer, and it will become increasingly serious. We agree with Dr. Ma's proposal that the government should issue effective measures to sanction those who make "national crisis fortunes" and order their strict implementation. However, in fact, those who make "national crisis fortunes" are not just these unscrupulous elements: let's leave others aside for the time being, such as: "There are some 'landlords' and some 'sub-landlords' on Hong Kong Island. They are also taking advantage of the 'national crisis' to make a great 'fortune'!"

Some "landlords" and some "sub-landlords" are taking advantage of the national crisis, taking advantage of people's difficulties, arbitrarily increasing rents, or raising prices indiscriminately, ignoring the suffering of people who are displaced and have lost their homes, only seeking wealth to enter their doors, to enjoy their leisure. This kind of selfish and self-interested behavior, even if we ignore the impact on the progress of the entire war of resistance, is something that needs to be condemned, even from the point of view of human beings helping each other.

We hope that people in society will also thoroughly investigate those who use houses as a tool for making "national crisis fortunes"!

### Remembering Mr. Mao Dun

— Wen Yu

Judging by the date, he should have arrived in Kunming by now, Mr. Mao Dun wrote to me on the 19th, informing me of his departure, and he left here on the 20th. I have no chance to meet him. What I feel in my heart is infinite regret, as if there is an irreparable loss, and I have been unhappy for several days because of it. I admire, respect, and cherish him as my first and dearest teacher.

The north is bitterly cold, and it must be a time when the snow has covered the ankles. The sorrowful sky freezes the layers of clouds, low and dark, and the distant wind and sand sting the faces of passersby. There is no singing of birds, no low humming of insects, and no trace of green can be drilled out of the white wilderness. Perhaps only the continuous mountains, the decaying ancient roads, have the tragic sound of famous horses of the border neighing in the wind, and the golden eagle spreading its great wings... With passion, Mr. Mao Dun has stepped towards the "new land" of the northwest. In the distant corners of the earth, I respectfully offer my prayers for a safe journey against the wind from the north.

The northwest, with its magnificent mountains and rivers, is the arm of the motherland. Mother Nature, here, tempers her children, as if she were using a merciless whip on them. However, the children have iron-like hands and strong bodies that resist wind and snow because of this. The sentence "There is no spring here" has become their proud phrase in their life struggles. Mr. Mao Dun is weak in literature, but he has great hope. He wants to live there as a "spiritual mentor" for young people, instructing them to "fight for the glory of this generation"—therefore, I sincerely pray for his life and hope.

However, how jealous I am at this time! Does Mr. Mao Dun have a preference for the youth of the Northwest? Or is it that the laziness and dullness of our children in the South are not worthy of Mr. Mao Dun's teachings? No, that's not it—the times need his strength, and great strength can only be unfolded in a great realm. The "new land" in the Northwest needs Mr. Mao Dun to cultivate, so he has to brave the wind and snow, run long distances, and heavily shoulder the burden that awaits him. I think I should let go of my jealousy, but a sense of envy cannot be let go.

Mr. Mao Dun's arrival was a great joy for the literary and artistic youth here. He is a role model but not an idol. He is a leader who raises the flag and leads the way, not as an adult, but with the love, guidance, and kindness of a teacher and a friend, giving them affectionately. Therefore, they have a vigorous vitality for upward development.

Mr. Mao Dun has artistic tolerance. He knows very well that if he uses his all-seeing eyes to illuminate our works that are "not very qualified" yet, it would just be a piece of dull wood, just a pile of sea sand. But, perhaps this wood can be carved into art, and perhaps this pile of sea sand also contains gold. He feels that art can have a certain degree of tolerance, and he does not hesitate to make his own publications, in which he pours his heart and soul, a bit "haphazard." This tolerance has inspired the hearts of many of our literary and artistic youth and made us realize that we should move forward.

He also has artistic rigor. He knows very well that if he does not give "young people" a standard, they will be confused and waste their efforts, and they will not find the true path. Therefore, rigor and tolerance become a double beauty, or even a "double perfection"—although "rotten wood cannot be carved," he will never forget to point out that if there is still beauty in the rotten wood, he will remove the rotten parts and keep the solid parts, and personally start working on it. Who would not understand his good intentions? Whoever does not, is willing to lose out. Whoever can truly understand it will gain the most valuable lessons.

"Mr. Mao Dun and Mr. Lu Xun are very similar, right?" Perhaps someone would ask. Yes, Mr. Mao Dun is now continuing the work of his old friend, and now he is shouldering double the responsibility. Ms. Jing Song said in "Lu Xun and the Youth" (Wen Zhen, Volume 2, Issue 1): "Sometimes when meeting foreign friends, when asked about the future of the Chinese intellectual community, Mr. (Lu Xun) must mention Mr. ×× and ×× youth... and often worried that Mr. ××'s body was too weak, even more than his own. Now, unfortunately, it has been two years since Mr. Lu Xun passed away. I hope that Mr. ××, etc., will take care of themselves for the sake of the country and strive for the future." Yes, Mr. Lu Xun, with his tough fighting spirit, has passed away, and Mr. Mao Dun has an increased responsibility. The highest intention of "taking care of himself for the sake of the country" is dedicated to this literary giant thousands of miles away.

### Today's First Division Football League: Only Eastern Team Plays for the Chinese; Several Eastern Players Injured, Formation Changes

[Report from Our Newspaper] South China is small, nostalgic for soldiers, but the battles in the football city are not cooling down due to South China's travels in Vietnam.

Today at noon, there are as many as sixteen league matches in the First, Second, and Third Divisions. Among the First Division Chinese teams, only Eastern is playing. We should focus our attention on this.

Eastern is playing against the Hong Kong Football Club. Both are teams that are behind in points. The outcome is not of great importance.

Kowloon Football Club versus Middlesex also lacks importance. However, the match at the narrow Kowloon Football Club ground is noteworthy. In terms of strength, the Middlesex team is stronger. Moreover, Gurney has completed his suspension and can play today. Logically, they should have a good chance of winning. However, the venue is unfavorable to the visiting team, so the away team may not find it easy to win.

The Navy's current points are only one point behind South China. Therefore, any gains the team makes in any match from now on will have a significant impact on South China. They will definitely win today's match against the Police Football Club. It is expected that the Police will not be able to achieve much, which will benefit both South China teams.

Eastern's Song Ling, Li Deqi, and 　　Tao were all injured in last week's Special Silver Shield. However, Li may still play today, while Song will need to rest. Xu Jingcheng has been specially recalled to resume his position as center forward, and Lai Tingcai has been promoted to left winger. If so, the attacking power will definitely decrease, and victory may not be guaranteed. The two formations are as follows: (Football Field Deity)

### Tonight's Women's Basketball Game: Mei Fang vs. Overseas Chinese Have a Fierce Competition; South China vs. Pui To at 6:30 PM

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since Guangda and Zhixing successively withdrew from this year's women's basketball 　, the multi-faceted championship competition has changed into a three-way standoff.

Mei Fang, Pui To, and 　qiao are the three current powers. However, the Overseas Chinese team has had an unfavorable start, having lost once to Zhixing and again to Pui To, their position is shaky, and their hope of winning the championship is not as high as that of Mei Fang and Pui To. Although Zhixing's withdrawal allows them to cancel that defeat, a glimmer of light has returned to their future, but they have already changed and stained a little flaw.

Observing the recent situation, Mei Fang and Pui To have not suffered a defeat. Regarding the championship ticket, there is only "me and you." However, Pui To has already defeated Overseas Chinese a few days ago, eliminating a strong opponent. Their situation is relatively good, while Mei Fang is not, because Pui To and Overseas Chinese have not yet fought.

Therefore, tonight's battle between Mei Fang and Overseas Chinese is of great importance to the championship issue. If Mei Fang wins, they will overcome a hurdle, and their position and situation will be no different from Pui To. When they compete with Pui To on the fourteenth night, the winner at that time will be the champion.

If Mei Fang fails tonight, the situation will change, benefiting both Pui To and Overseas Chinese. However, the benefit gained by Overseas Chinese still depends on 　. If Overseas Chinese wins tonight, they still have to wait until the fourteenth night when Mei Fang fights Pui To to see who controls the left coupon, and then they can determine their own fate. If Pui To defeats Mei Fang at that time, then the championship will be won by Pui To, and Overseas Chinese and Mei Fang will only compete for the runner-up.

Therefore, for the sake of their own interests, Overseas Chinese must have a kind of contradictory mentality in both the tonight and the fourteenth night matches. What they want to achieve tonight is to defeat Mei Fang, and what they want to achieve on the fourteenth night is to hope that Mei Fang can defeat Pui To. However, this kind of overly selfish ideal may not be realized. However, there are many dreams in basketball, and it may even become a reality.

In short, for Overseas Chinese, there is still hope of winning in tonight's battle, but losing will mean no chance. Therefore, for the sake of their own future, they must fight Mei Fang to the death, and Mei Fang dare not assume that they will definitely win.

A word to the male and female fans, arrive early tonight, because there are not many seats in the gym, 　 arriving late may cause a sigh of regret. The competition schedule is as follows: [Dong Lang]

6:30 PM South China vs. Pui To

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment... Three Sisters Sally, Irene And Mary

Is a song and dance film, a musical, radio star, and a silver screen actress concentrated in a song and dance film. The story is scattered, but a song and dance film does not necessarily need a perfect story. It relies on gorgeous arrangements and humorous song and dance to create a successful "song and dance film" that can entertain people.

Alice Faye and Tony Martin have excellent singing and dancing skills. Big Nose Jimmy Durante's humor is consistent and also an outstanding character in the film.

Queen Peace... Iron 　 Hero Men With Wings

The whole film narrates the 　 of the American aviation industry in the past thirty or forty years, and can also be said to be the process of mankind's conquest of space. As a 　 systematic narrative, we often admit that this is also a great and valuable work in the history of film.

The story material seems too broad, so the plot is lengthy, which makes people feel a slight lack of dramatic power. However, all kinds of tense and thrilling scenes completely mask this shortcoming, such as flight accidents, aerial dogfights, life-and-death test flights, the second trans-Atlantic westwards feat, and escaping from a burning aircraft with a parachute. These are all extremely stimulating scenes, and there are also passionate people with a spirit of fearlessness and lofty ambitions, doing earth-shattering feats. Behind them, there are also women who encourage and help, and at the same time worry and cry silently, 　 These are all 　 rich in manipulating the audience's 　 mood power.

The use of color in this film is more than suitable. Starting with those field sceneries, to various brightly colored aircraft soaring in the blue sky full of colorful clouds, the beauty of the picture adds a lot of beauty to the audience.

The acting skills of Fly McCrea and Lei Miller are all very refined. The heroine, Louise Campbell, is a new star who used to play some relatively ordinary films and did not receive much attention. In this film, we discovered that she is a very promising talent.

Oriental... Revolutionary Couple Beloved Enemy

A film about the Irish Revolution. Maner Olang plays the daughter of the British Governor-General in Ireland. She sympathizes with the Irish Revolution and falls in love with their leader (Brand Alan).

The director handled this film quite successfully. Several scenes of searching for 　 Party scenes are also very tense. 　 can grasp the climax of the whole play, and the male and female protagonists are very competent.

Dahua... West Line Spy Network Lancer Spy

The story describes a British officer who looks like a German officer, and the German officer is captured by the British army. He disguises himself as a German officer to go back and scout the enemy's situation, but the German officer has a lover, and this lover does counter-espionage work for Germany. Unexpectedly, they really fall in love with each other, reveal their true feelings, and let the fake German officer go back.

There have been many stories of this kind of espionage activity in the past. This film is certainly not novel. The whole film is handled very loosely, especially the first half is too dull. The two protagonists, George Sanders and 　　　　　　　　, also have no distinctive performance.

Jingxing... Doubly Loyal Love Sta boll Quest

Starring Mona Loa and George Blake

Central... Lu Gong Secret History The Prlsoner of Zenda

A story of heroes and beauties. The male lead, Coleman, plays two roles in this 　. His performance is vivid and lifelike. The heroine, Mandelin Carroll, and supporting actors such as Xiao Fan Punk have excellent performances.

Lee Theatre... Wang Xia's Four Clans

Mandarin Film

Starring Wang Yin and Zhang Cuihong

New World... Eighth Heaven

Cantonese Film

Starring Xue Juexian and Tang 　qing

Taiping... Cantonese Opera

Taiping Male and Female Troupe

Day Show - Treasure Sword Subdues the Demon

Night Show - Infatuated Girl

Gao Sheng... Cantonese Opera

Jintianhua Troupe

Day Show - No Performance

Night Show - Yang Zongbao

Puqing... Cantonese Opera

Juexian Sheng Male and Female Troupe

### The Relationship Between Physical Exercise and Diet

- Yu Xuecheng

If you want to strengthen your physique, in addition to exercise, you must also have sufficient nutrition. Many people exercise very hard, but the result is not only no progress but even regression, which is also because of a lack of nutrition. Today, physical education in this extraordinary period focuses on the training of qi and strength, so heavy exercise is the most suitable. Heavy exercise consumes a lot of qi and strength, so nutrition must be increased to 　 supplement it. The nutrition needed by inactive people is far below that of people who are active or work hard. The stronger the physique, the stronger the appetite. Exercise can also activate various parts of the body and harmonize the functions of various organs, improving the efficiency of functions, so the digestive function is旺盛.

In short, exercise and nutrition have a close relationship. If there is a lack of exercise, even if there is rich nutrition, it cannot be 　　. Also, if nutrition is insufficient, exercise cannot be effective. Sufficient nutrition or appropriate food can assist the effect of exercise.

Appropriate food can not only assist exercise, but also assist medicine or directly treat a variety of diseases. The formation of heart disease, pain 　, nephritis, gallstones, skin disease, neuritis and rheumatism and other diseases is often due to nutritional deficiencies or food loss 　. Many people think that they only need to eat more food rich in final nutrition to maintain health, without exercise, which is a kind of wrong concept.

Nutritious foods are not necessarily delicacies such as mountain delicacies and seafood. Such foods are not only far 　 in nutrition than vegetables 　, ordinary meat 　, eggs and other foods, but also inferior in digestion and assimilation. If you cannot 水貨, 　 eating extremely nutritious foods is also useless. Moreover, luxury items such as mountain delicacies and seafood are extremely unsuitable for use during the current war of resistance.

Many people think that nutrition must refer to the quality of food. In fact, this is not the case. What is most related is not the quality of food, but the method and habits of eating. During the war, the quality of food is even more lacking. The remedy is to pay attention to the method of eating.

Eating methods or habits have a close relationship with daily life. Irregular daily life or actions that violate health principles have a great impact on eating habits and methods. Therefore, if you want to improve eating habits and methods, you must first make your daily life conform to health principles.

Regarding the question of how many meals should be eaten each day, some advocate three meals, and others advocate as many as five meals. There are different opinions, but most people advocate three meals a day. The number of meals per day is inversely proportional to the amount of food per meal. The more meals, the less food per meal. If you have three meals a day, the amount of food for breakfast should be the least and dinner should be the most. If the quality of dinner is appropriate, you can skip breakfast the next day, so some people advocate eating two meals a day, namely lunch and dinner, but for people who work hard, if they only eat two meals a day, 　 they can have lunch at 10:00 AM and dinner at 6:00 PM.

### Hong Kong Football Technical Level Indeed Not as Good as Before (2)

— Old Comrades of the Field

Are not all these enough to prove that today's footballers' skills are indeed far inferior to before? Moreover, anyone who has watched the international match between Ireland and Portugal the previous week should still remember how inadequate the strength and technique of little Couthino was. Yet, even when he was almost exhausted in the tough match, he could still seize an opportunity to break through and score a goal single-handedly. Furthermore, the Portuguese team's left inside, Gomes (also translated as Kim, but the Portuguese pronunciation is as above), although not considered technically poor, was not an exceptionally strong player either. Yet, on that day, he was able to score four goals because the Irish team was focused on closely guarding big Couthino. What is this all about? It should be known that although the Irish team was not considered strong on that day, one of their inner defenders, Shi of the Gomido team, is indeed one of the famous inner defenders of various teams today. Moreover, the goalkeeper was McAlistar of the Navy team "Red Duke," who is considered one of the best goalkeepers today. Therefore, it is another ironclad proof that the technical level of today's football team is far inferior to before.

Since football is the sport in which our country has the best chance of victory in athletic competitions, how can we preserve it? This is the most pressing task. I loudly proclaim that "the technical level of Hong Kong football has indeed deteriorated compared to the past," not to criticize today's footballers, but to promote our country's sports and earnestly seek to preserve our country's reputation as the overlord of Far Eastern football and prevent it from declining. Fellow footballers, you must not be complacent; you must always strive for further progress. There is great hope.

Some may ask with doubt, "Since you care so much about football, how can today's Hong Kong footballers improve?" I would say that since the skills of the Western teams in Hong Kong are deteriorating daily, even complete victories in competitions are not enough to increase the enthusiasm of Hong Kong football fans by even a fraction. It is essential for those in charge to collect teaching materials and books, for the enlightened to train the less enlightened actively based on these books, and to seize every opportunity to travel to other places for effective practice. This is the best strategy. It is rumored that the Tung Wah Association plans to travel to Java this year and also visit Australia. If this plan materializes, it will be greatly beneficial. Since there is such an opportunity, the organizers of the South China Athletic Association should do their best to make it happen and not dwell on temporary successes or failures. It should be known that a sports association with a history like the South China Athletic Association bears a particularly great responsibility. It should prioritize training talent for the country, and this is its inescapable duty. As for other associations, such as the Eastern Athletic Association, since their players are all overseas Chinese, they should also do their best to encourage their members to travel far and wide to learn from others' strengths. The competition for the Hong Kong championship is merely a minor matter. (The End)

### Hong Kong Representatives in the Philippine Interport Football Tournament Do Not Need Preliminary Selection

Yesterday afternoon, this reporter visited Mr. Wong Ka, chairman of the management committee under the Football Association, to inquire about the Philippine team's visit to Hong Kong for a match. According to Mr. Wong, he is currently one of the selection committee members for the Hong Kong-Philippine interport match. At a temporary meeting of the management committee a few days ago, it was decided to send a letter inviting the Philippine team to visit Hong Kong for a match. Whether the team will come to Hong Kong depends on the Philippine side's response, which is expected to be known in a few days. The reporter also asked whether the selection committee would follow the practice of previous years, where preliminary trials are held for the Chinese team and the reserve team, and then the official players are selected, if the Philippine team could come to Hong Kong. Mr. Wong replied that the committee members already had a clear idea of the candidates and that such trouble was unnecessary. Once the Philippine side replied, they could select the players at any time.

### US Budget for Next Year Submitted to Congress for Review, Huge Defense Expenditure, President Advocates Slightly Increasing Tax Rates

[Reuters, Washington, 6th] The expenditure for naval construction in the US budget for 1940 has increased from $115,000,000 to $270,000,000. This increased expenditure will be used to build two battleships in 1940 and expand the naval air force to a target of 3,000 aircraft, starting with 93. The naval personnel will also increase by 5,500 to 113,000. [Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] The Navy Department has submitted a bill to Congress, advocating that the Federal Maritime Commission be authorized to requisition all sailors in the country as soon as the President declares a state of alert (i.e., before declaring war on a foreign country) so that they can quickly respond to the emergency.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 6th] The US budget for 1940 has been submitted to Congress for review. There is a significant shortfall, and the special defense budget is a special feature of this budget. The income is listed as $5,669,000,000, and the expenditure is listed as $8,995,000,000, resulting in a shortfall of $3,216,000,000. The defense budget is listed as $1,320,000,000, an increase of $309,000,000 over 1939. President Roosevelt stated in his message that special items in the special defense budget should be listed as temporary in nature. He also stated that the large-scale relief program is of great benefit, but the government will never implement it by drastic means. He also advocated that tax rates should be slightly increased compared to before. As for the increased defense expenditure of $309,000,000, $99,000,000 will be used to complete current projects, and the remaining $210,000,000 will be included in new projects. The government will submit this new plan to Congress for review in the future. In the budget expenditure, the relief fund is $2,266,000,000. Other major items include $721,000,000 for the Navy Department, $516,000,000 for the Army Department (including the Panama Canal Authority's expenses), and $706,000,000 for the Department of Agriculture. The President's message continued that the government has not wasted a single bit of the taxes paid by the people. On the contrary, most of the government's shortfall has been transformed into national wealth. As for the views of various parties that the ordinary budget must be able to maintain balance and that special budgets often cannot maintain balance, this statement is inaccurate. It is hoped that in years of economic prosperity, the national budget will have a surplus to make up for the shortfall in future years.

### Polish Foreign Minister Meets with Hitler, Content of Talks Not Disclosed

[Reuters, Berlin, 5th] Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck had a long talk with Hitler this afternoon in Berchtesgaden. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. The content of the talks has not been disclosed. It is said that the issues of Jewish refugees in Poland, the German minority issue, and the issue of the Free City of Danzig were all discussed.

### "Star of Egypt" Diamond for Sale, Estimated at £50,000 to £70,000

[Haitong News Agency, London, 6th] A famous jewelry store here has been commissioned to sell the extremely famous 250-carat diamond, "Star of Egypt." This diamond belonged to the Egyptian King 50 years ago and is now estimated to be worth between £50,000 and £70,000.

### Danish National Socialist Party to Be Banned, "Unpatriotic Behavior"

[Reuters, Copenhagen, 5th] It is rumored in political circles here that the Danish National Socialist Party will be banned by the government due to its "unpatriotic behavior." It is also claimed that party members serving in the police force have been informing Germany of the country's secret documents.

### Britain Prepares to Unite with the US for Economic Retaliation Against Japan, Experts Advocate Raising Import Tariffs and Reducing Import Quotas for Japanese Goods

[Central News Agency, London, 5th] Prime Minister Chamberlain held talks with Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon this morning. It is reported that they discussed the issue of imposing economic retaliation on Japan, which is the only way to force Japan to treat British interests in China better. Regarding this matter, experts advocate raising import tariffs on Japanese goods in all territories of the British Empire and reducing import quotas. Chancellor Simon does not seem to agree, but the final decision of the British government depends on the attitude of the United States. Even if the United States does not take the same measures, as long as it takes similar measures, the British government can impose strong measures on Japan. In any case, it can be asserted that the amount of British credit loans to China will definitely be substantially increased.

[Central News Agency, London, 5th] It is generally believed that Prime Minister Chamberlain has decided to adopt a firmer attitude towards the dictatorial countries. Well-informed sources say that Britain's attitude towards Japan, Germany, and Italy will all become tougher. As for Japan, the British government seems to be waiting for the United States to make a decision on the issue of revising the Neutrality Act before contacting it to jointly impose economic pressure on Japan.

[Reuters, London, 6th] The "Manchester Evening News" wrote today, "Relying on time to make Japan fail is impatient and ill-considered because Japan is currently using very economical methods to manage the war in China and may be able to obtain the benefits of managing Chinese resources in the short term. However, on the other hand, Japan is very dependent on export trade, and its gold reserves are almost exhausted. This is a very dangerous weakness of Japan, which is well known to President Roosevelt's advisors."

[Reuters, London, 6th] The "Financial Times" published an article today, saying, "It is clearly impractical for Western countries to directly interfere in China at present, but it is another matter for Britain to protect its economic interests. We are fully armed in this regard, and our weapons are sharp and tenacious, so we should use them. Today, Japan's 'fatal weakness' is not funds but markets, and Britain's international trade is very attractive. If Britain decides to completely exclude the import of Japanese goods, what in the world can stop Britain (or the United States) from implementing its determination? At the same time, since the issue of 'credit loans' to China is being discussed today, we should at least not neglect any opportunity to make Sino-British relations closer." The newspaper concluded, "If the British government does not cooperate with the United States and establish an understanding with the Chinese National Government, its negligence is intolerable."

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] US Senator Clark predicted that Congress will prevent President Roosevelt from taking economic retaliation methods to oppose the perpetrators because this move will create "a state of war. Unless we are prepared for war, this matter will meet with severe opposition." When Italy invaded Abyssinia, it suffered economic sanctions, and Mussolini declared this "a state of war."

### British Prime Minister Issues Statement Praising Roosevelt's Speech, Hitler Will Also Reply

[Reuters, London, 5th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain made a statement at 10 Downing Street today on President Roosevelt's address to Congress, saying, "All those who bear the heavy responsibility of governing cannot but be moved by President Roosevelt's heartfelt address to the representatives of the American people (i.e., members of Congress). People here deeply feel that only through freedom and peace can we make the welfare and prosperity that we have strived for generations grow. The feelings expressed by President Roosevelt point out the important duties of the American democratic country in the world and the ideals that the country is working for in human progress."

[Associated Press, New York, 6th] Newspapers here support Roosevelt's speech on international policy and defense policy, but they are dissatisfied with the President's domestic spending plan.

[Reuters, Berlin, 5th] It is learned that the German diplomatic community is very annoyed by US President Roosevelt's speech. However, it is generally expected that Germany will not file an official protest with the United States. The most likely development is that Hitler will deliver a speech at the German Parliament meeting on the 20th of this month to respond to President Roosevelt's speech. At present, it is still generally believed that the United States and Germany will sever diplomatic relations. Various circles in Germany point out that the United States is interfering in matters that have nothing to do with it and causing disputes. Germany is only defending itself.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 6th] The German press expressed anger at several points in President Roosevelt's speech to Congress yesterday. At the same time, they were even more angry at the speech of the chairman of the US Foreign Relations Committee, Pittman, who said, "He believes that the US government has decided to not only protest in the future, but also implement moral and financial sanctions." The German press believes that Pittman's words are even stronger than President Roosevelt's broad statement.

### British Unemployed Workers Wire King, Requesting Recall of Anderson to Carry Out Air Defense Steps

[Haitong News Agency, London, 6th] The British Unemployed Workers Federation wired the King yesterday, requesting the immediate recall of Sir Anderson, who is currently on vacation in Switzerland. The telegram stated that Sir Anderson should immediately carry out air defense steps because the implementation of this step can accommodate a large number of unemployed workers. At the same time, the Unemployed Workers Federation issued a public statement, expressing dissatisfaction with the fact that the Minister of Home Security, Anderson, is currently on vacation abroad because many representatives are willing to discuss the issue of building air-raid shelters to accommodate some unemployed workers with Sir Anderson. The statement also pointed out that the construction of air-raid shelters can use skilled workers and also unskilled workers. In addition, the negotiations between the representatives of the unemployed workers and the Ministry of Labor regarding winter relief have not yielded any results.

### × Studying the US Note, US Ambassador Grew Returns Home, Believed to Have No Major Political Significance

(Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th) Tokyo Foreign News, After repeated cabinet meetings in Japan, the spokesman of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with reporters for the first time this morning. When a reporter asked about the Japanese government's attitude towards the US note of December 31, the spokesman replied that the wording of the US note was excellent and that it was currently being studied, so no comments could be made for the time being. As for whether the Japanese government will submit a reply, it has not been decided. Regarding the President's message to Congress, the spokesman refused to express an opinion. Next, a reporter asked about the drug trafficking situation in the Japanese-occupied areas of China. The Japanese spokesman said that the Japanese authorities have strict control over drug trafficking in the occupied areas and that all the statements made by the British newspapers are completely unfounded.

(Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "I believe that US Ambassador Grew's return home has no major political significance but may make it easier for the US government to understand the truth of the situation in the Far East." Regarding the possibility of the United States amending the Neutrality Act, the spokesman said, "The US business community has not made any statements."

### × Brief Biographies of New Cabinet Members (Continued)

× The new Minister of Agriculture and Forestry was transmitted by telegram as Machida yesterday, but it has now been confirmed as Yukio Sakurauchi. Special supplementary biographies of Sakurauchi and Minister of Health and Welfare Hisatada Hirose are as follows:

Sakurauchi, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, is from Shimane Prefecture and is currently 60 years old. He graduated from Waseda University. He was originally a member of the Seiyukai Party. After Takashi Hara was assassinated in 1921, Kiyoura Takahashi succeeded him as the president of the Seiyukai Party. Tatsuo Yamamoto and others defected from the party due to their opposition to Takahashi and formed the Seiyu Honto Party. Sakurauchi was also one of them. In 1927, the Seiyu Honto Party and the Kenseikai Party merged to form the Minseito Party, and Sakurauchi became an important member. In 1931, he was elected as the Secretary-General of the Minseito Party and joined the second Wakatsuki Cabinet as the Minister of Commerce and Industry in the same year. Later, he served as the chief executive of the Minseito Party and is currently a permanent advisor to the party. He has long been known as "Chief of Headquarters" in the party and belongs to the same faction as Chuji Machida, but recently he has been actively wooing the party's reformists. He seems to only have some sympathy for the new party movement and is not willing to formally participate in activities. In addition, Sakurauchi also has a considerable position in the business world. He participated in the establishment of the Japan Electric Light Company and served as the president of the Koto River Electric Power Company and a military advisor for several other companies. He recently resigned as the president of the electric power company not long ago.

Hirose, Minister of Health and Welfare, is from Yamanashi Prefecture and is 51 years old. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University. He has a very close relationship with Ushio Keisuke. When Ushio served as the Minister of Home Affairs in the Hirota Cabinet in 1936, Hirose served as the Director-General of the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs. When Ushio recommended Keiho Yamamoto as the vice chairman of the Fukushi Foundation, a charitable organization, Hirose served as the chairman of the foundation's board of directors. In addition, Hirose also served as the executive secretary of the Population Problem Research Association. Recently, he served as the Vice Minister of Health and Welfare under Minister of Health and Welfare Kido. In this cabinet reshuffle, he was promoted from Vice Minister to Minister. He has the ability to handle social affairs and is a pro-military young bureaucrat. (The End)

### French Premier Arrives in Algiers for Military Conference, Continuing to Increase Defense in North Africa, Italian Consulate in Tunisia Protests French Demonstration

[Reuters, Bizerte, 5th] French Premier Daladier arrived here today from Sousse. On the same day, he took the patrol ship "Foch" to Algiers and is expected to arrive tomorrow morning. Moroccan Governor-General Noguès has arrived in Algiers to attend a military conference, which will be held tomorrow and chaired by Premier Daladier.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 6th] French Premier Daladier left here last night by ship to Algiers. After Daladier boarded the ship, he telegraphed French President Lebrun to express his gratitude for the public's loyalty to France in Tunisia. Daladier's current tour of Corsica, Tunisia, and Algiers will be made into a film, which will be shown in Paris next week for government officials and the diplomatic community to preview, and then publicly screened in the country.

[Haitong News Agency, Tunis, 6th] According to French reports, in addition to strengthening the fortifications of Tunis and the various forts in North Africa, a second batch of Senegalese (West African) troops will set sail from Marseille today and head to French Somaliland in East Africa. It is reported that there are currently 97 battalions of fusiliers, 8 regiments of Spahis, and 30,000 troops of various types in French North Africa. At present, some parties in France are still planning to make major preparations as necessary, but Italy is not surprised at all and remains silent, observing how the future situation will evolve.

[Reuters, Sousse, Tunisia, 5th] Arab Jews welcomed French Premier Daladier in El Jem today, saying, "Our protector is Daladier, not Mussolini. We need nothing other than France."

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 6th] The Italian Consul-General in Tunisia protested to the Governor about the anti-Italian demonstrations during Daladier's visit and the repeated insults to the Italian flag, which aroused public anger among the Tunisian people.

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 6th] It was officially announced that the representatives of various Italian groups in Tunisia have passed a resolution against France and sent the resolution to the Italian Consul-General in the area, requesting the Italian Consul to forward it to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The resolution emphasizes the inalienable rights guaranteed by a thousand-year-old tradition and treaties and expresses resentment at the continuous provocation and violence against Italians, as well as anger at the insults to the Italian flag. The resolution most firmly declares that the Italians in Tunisia are loyal to the Italian Emperor, Amedeo, and the Italian Prime Minister, Mussolini.

Brief Commentary

### New Good News

At a time when fascist aggressors are setting fires of war everywhere, we are actually hearing President of the United States's speech and a declaration by the British Prime Minister. One cannot but recognize this as new good news for the New Year of 1939 and report it to the readers.

In a speech to Congress on the 4th, US President Roosevelt pointed out that Fascist aggressors were expanding the war, threatening the world, and threatening the essential religions, democracy and international good faith of the United States; Roosevelt then stated that if the United States required freedom, happiness, and the ability to fulfill its responsibilities to the world, it would have to resolutely prepare at any cost to stop the fascist aggression by force. Not only did this speech emphasize modifying current American foreign policy, national defense plans, and the Neutrality Act within the country, it also expanded the influence of the peace front internationally, providing new stimulus for democracies that were struggling, having recently succumbed to the aggression of Japan, Germany, and Italy. British Prime Minister Chamberlain also made a declaration on the 5th—in addition to expressing agreement with Roosevelt's speech, he specifically explained, "We welcome the feelings expressed by Roosevelt, recognizing this as another clear sign of America's important position in the world, and we know that America is enthusiastically supporting the ideals of human progress." These clear expressions by the heads of state of the United Kingdom and the United States demonstrate that the unity of the peaceful democratic countries has presented a brighter future, and also proves that our country's firm unity in resisting aggression possesses a brighter future. Today, we must take a more firm and correct stance, stand on the peace front, and redouble our efforts to oppose fascist aggressors. The light of victory has shone on the faces of every person who does not want to be a slave!

Intensify Cleaning Work

The international situation is improving day by day, domestic politics are progressing, and the situation of resistance against aggression has stabilized. These facts prove that we will embark on the road to victory this year. However, there are still many obstacles on this road to victory. What deserves special attention now is, first, the utter failure of Wang Jingwei's capitulation route, which has declared the decline of the German-Italian route advocated by the world as well, while his apologists and mouthpieces continue to use various methods to defend and decorate him, confusing people's minds. Second, although the collapse of the Konoe Cabinet of × country has exposed the seriousness of Japan's domestic and international crises, the succeeding Hiranuma Cabinet has made a tyrannical declaration to continue invading China. Judging by their absurd leaflet distribution on the 5th in Shanghai, it is enough to prove that the schemes of × people and traitors to divide and cause peace will intensify in the future—these are all obstacles on our road to victory that must be cleaned up. Chongqing has already launched a movement to clean up publications that hinder the national revolutionary resistance, and commanders from all over the country and local authorities have successively telegraphed their support for the central government's resistance against aggression and punishment of Wang, while civilian groups in Hong Kong and Shanghai, and compatriots in Southeast Asia, have also warmly telegraphed their support for the National Government and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, thoroughly rooting out traitors and insisting on resistance. Our ambassadors to the United Kingdom and France have also denounced the × traitors for their shameless rumors, but since the conspiracy activities of the × traitors have spread everywhere, everyone should set their minds and encourage themselves, assist the government, and start from their own surroundings to clear away these obstacles on the road to victory!

### British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Discuss European Situation, French Newspaper Says Chamberlain to Adopt a Tougher Attitude if Italy Does Not Keep Its Word

(Central News Agency, London, 6th) Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax held talks yesterday at the Prime Minister's official residence at Downing Street to discuss the European situation in preparation for next week's visit to Italy. On their way to Italy, the two plan to stop in Paris for about an hour, where the Prime Minister may take the opportunity to exchange views with the British Ambassador to France.

(Reuters, Paris, 6th) "Le Figaro" commented today on the British Prime Minister's visit to Rome, believing that if Italy cannot show good faith, Chamberlain will express a tougher attitude than former British Foreign Secretary Eden. The newspaper said that Chamberlain is a man of no illusions and strong religious beliefs, saying, "Chamberlain will travel a long way to appease Italy, but if the Italian side does not cooperate sincerely, so that this work cannot be completed, he must feel that he must take a firm attitude due to the pressure of British public opinion."

### Counteroffensive by the Southwestern Government Army in Madrid; Heavy Losses for the Rebels, Fierce Fighting Ongoing; Bombing of Barcelona Was a Planned Act

[Reuters, London, 5th] Spanish rebels occupied Brunete this morning. According to the Spanish News Agency, government troops have launched a counteroffensive southwest of Madrid, in Boadilla del Monte. Reports indicate the rebels suffered heavy losses and many were captured by the government forces. Fierce fighting is currently underway.

[Haitong Agency, Burgos, 6th] It is announced here that the National Army is advancing towards the Guadalajara line. In one to three days, they captured 238,844 government soldiers.

[Haitong Agency, Paris, 6th] It is learned here that government troops suddenly occupied Valls, a small town twelve kilometers north of Senaroia, which is extremely important. The government Commander-in-Chief, Miaja, believes this counteroffensive can relieve the crisis on the Guadalajara line, just as Franco's troops attacked Valencia last July, only to be repelled by the Guadalajara troops across the Ebro River. It is noted that Miaja's troops are currently attacking an area rich in iron, tin, and lead mines. It is reported that government forces have cut off railway traffic between Pirenices and Sabadell.

[Reuters, London, 5th] The British Foreign Office today released the report of the British committee sent to Spain to investigate the air raids. The report states: "The evidence we have obtained proves that the bombing of Barcelona on New Year's Eve by the rebels was a planned act of harming human life. At the time of the bombing, the streets were extremely crowded with pedestrians. Most of the bombs dropped were lightweight bombs, unsuitable for bombing houses and ships. The time between the air raid siren and the start of the bombing was eight minutes, so 44 people were killed, 66 were seriously injured, and 25 were slightly injured."

[Reuters, London, 5th] The Spanish rebel authorities have falsely accused British officials, employees, and other personnel in San Sebastian, San Sebastián, and Burgos of improper conduct. British Foreign Secretary Halifax has ordered an investigation into all matters related to this accusation. The British Chargé d'Affaires in San Sebastian, O'Malley, and the British representative in Burgos, Jerram, will begin the investigation.

### The Anglo-American Commercial Treaty and Anglo-American-Canadian Trade Relations

The December report of the Royal Bank of Canada states: The recently announced US-Canada commercial treaty and the Central America commercial treaty make it possible to imagine the significance of the commercial relationship between them. The United States and Canada initially signed a commercial treaty in November 1935, which was implemented the following January, with a term of three years. During these three years, commerce between the two countries was greatly stimulated. Upon the expiration of the old treaty, a new treaty was signed, the establishment of which will further promote commercial development between the two countries, as can be expected.

According to official US statistics, in 1935, Canada's exports to the US were $286 million, and its imports from the US were $323 million, so the US had a surplus of $37 million. In 1936, the first year of the US-Canada commercial treaty, Canada's export trade increased to $376 million, mainly because the US suffered a drought that year, leading to a sharp increase in Canadian wheat, livestock, and other agricultural products exported to the US. There was also a large increase in the export of industrial products such as timber, especially from British Columbia. At the same time, exports to Canada also increased, but not by much. The total amount exported to Canada that year was $384 million, so the export volumes of the two countries were almost equal, with a difference of only $8 million. The following year, 1937, US exports to Canada increased significantly compared to the previous year, totaling $510 million, an increase of $126 million. Canada's exports were $399 million, an increase of $23 million. That year, the US trade surplus with Canada was $111 million, compared to only $8 million the previous year. Subsequently, the US economy declined, and due to abundant agricultural harvests, Canadian exports to the US plummeted. This trend continued into 1938. In the first eight months of 1938, Canadian product exports to the US fell to $162 million, compared to $279 million in the same period last year, while US exports to Canada remained strong, at $323 million, compared to $336 million in the same period last year. Therefore, in 1938, the US trade surplus with Canada reached $161 million.

Trade between the US and Canada occupies an important position in their foreign trade. For example, in 1930, the total exports of the US and Canada combined were over $1 million, of which US exports to Canada were $659 million, and Canadian exports to the US were $402 million. During the years of the US economic downturn, trade between the two countries also declined sharply. However, in the nine years from 1930 to 1938, the total exports of the two countries were approximately $650 million, of which US exports to Canada were $375 million, and Canadian exports to the US were $275 million. From this perspective, Canada accounts for one-seventh of the total US foreign trade volume, and the US trade surplus with Canada alone accounts for approximately $100 million, or one-fourth of the total US trade surplus. The second largest trade partner for the United States is the United Kingdom, although the total value is not as high as that with Canada, but the annual average total value from 1930 to 1938 was $569 million, of which US exports to the UK were $460 million, and UK exports to the US were $141 million. The largest portion of US exports to the UK is raw cotton. For example, in the year from July 1937 to July 1938, the UK purchased $85 million worth of US cotton, which is more than twice the amount purchased by any other country in the world (France ranked second with $40 million). In the past nine years, the US trade surplus with the UK has averaged $287 million annually. The UK is known to be a large importer, but it may not be widely known that US goods account for a large portion of its imports.

Over the nine years mentioned above, the US total export volume averaged $380 million annually. Within this figure, US exports to Canada were nearly $100 million, and exports to the UK reached $287 million. Therefore, it can be said that the US has consistently achieved a trade surplus in foreign trade over the past nine years, mainly due to these two countries.

Although the US and Canada bear a very significant role in terms of trade conditions, on the other hand, many Americans travel to Canada, spending large amounts of money, which in turn makes Canada's balance of payments with the US more favorable. Therefore, if we include this "trade created by tourism," the US has purchased more goods from Canada than Canada has purchased from the US since 1931. In the same example, the United States pays a large amount of money to foreign countries for shipping, insurance, etc., so based on the final conclusions of the two countries, the commercial conditions in the United Kingdom are much better than estimated based solely on export trade.

In modern times, all countries regard the amount of their export trade as determining the increase or decrease in the quantity of imports. Therefore, the balance of trade is of great importance. If the world were not the world it is today, but an ideal world, unconstrained by tariff policies and other commercial restrictions, then, according to economic principles, a country would purchase goods from the market with the lowest prices and sell goods in the market with the highest prices. Therefore, even if a country has an imbalance in its income and expenditure, it is not of great importance, because the mutual relations of other parties can quickly compensate for the omissions, and this is the reason. However, under the commercial policies dominated by nationalism, this problem becomes even more serious. At each meeting of the British Empire, the various departments of the British government are eager to obtain a greater share of the market in the member states. However, Argentina, Sweden, Norway and other countries are all large buyers of British goods, so the United Kingdom, when managing the number of its member states, cannot ignore the salvation of these countries. And because the United Kingdom absorbs such a large proportion of the export volume of countries all around the world, its member states and other countries have already made significant concessions to give them priority access to the United Kingdom. Therefore, if the United Kingdom wants to continue to buy the excess products of the United States, the limits imposed on the import of other countries will inevitably become narrower.

The United Kingdom's foreign investments are vast, so the UK had already recognized several years ago that a trade deficit was necessary, because purchasing goods from abroad would allow other countries to pay the interest on their investments. Due to this concession, the United Kingdom enjoys more favorable borrowing terms than other countries. Emerging countries generally lack resources. Therefore, during commercial recessions, the responsibility for maintaining world financial stability must fall on resource-rich developed countries. If countries can support international trade in good faith, without restrictions, and without being concerned about trade deficits, allowing free entry and exit, then this will greatly alleviate the current global difficulties. As a result, emerging countries will be able to continue to fulfill their debt obligations. The United Kingdom has consistently been a large net importer during this period, and without minding it, its contribution to the revival of world commerce is indeed significant. However, the recovery of world commerce will ultimately enable the domestic and foreign trade of the United Kingdom to benefit equally and achieve progress.

Editorial

### On the Policy that Britain Should Adopt towards the Far East

According to a Reuters dispatch from London, British merchants are very anxious about the "New Order in East Asia" that the Japanese militarists intend to implement, because this move by Japan is actually just an excuse to exclude the interests of third countries in China, in order to achieve its goal of monopolizing East Asia. A prominent British businessman, Mr. Li, wrote a letter to the London "Times" the day before yesterday, saying: "In the past, at least in theory, Japan still allowed the existence of the open-door policy and the Nine-Power Treaty when the Manchurian Incident occurred, but in its plan to establish a 'New Order' in the Far East, it has already obliterated them…" He then listed the examples of how British trade had been excluded and reduced to less than one percent after Japan annexed "Manchuria". In addition, the "Daily Telegraph" also published an article expressing its anger at Japan's implementation of the Monroe Doctrine in East Asia, which damages the interests of Western powers. We believe that the anxiety of British merchants is extremely correct, and their understanding of Japan's attempt is extremely clear. Perhaps only those who have suffered themselves will feel it so keenly.

Recently, the United States and Britain, seeing that the Japanese militarists are determined to destroy international conventions and monopolize Asia, and have no intention of "reining in at the edge of a cliff," have decided to jointly lend funds to China, which will provide us with a lot of assistance in transportation construction and the war of resistance, especially in terms of spiritual encouragement. The Chinese people, who are in the midst of today's difficult and dangerous war of resistance, express their infinite gratitude for this righteous act. However, for the sake of world peace and the interests of the great powers, especially Britain, in the Far East, it is necessary for Britain to take a further and more active policy towards the Far East from any point of view. Recently, the United States' policy towards Japan has gradually taken active and tough steps, driven by public opinion on the one hand and by the demands of domestic merchants on the other. The reason for the US government's strong note to Japan on October 6 last year was this. Japan's reply to the United States on November 18 last year was full of sophistry, which the US government considered unsatisfactory, and it sent another note to Japan on the 31st of last month, reiterating the US government's opinion. The note refuted Japan's exclusion of the businesses of American expatriates, placing Japanese citizens in a superior position, and violating certain international conventions. It particularly expressed its disapproval of the so-called "adaptation to the new situation in East Asia" and "construction of a new order in East Asia" that Japan intends to implement, and will take action in practice. It is heard that the 76th Congress will discuss this issue. It seems that the United States is ready to impose sanctions on Japan at a fairly mature stage.

Since the United States has such a determination towards the situation in the Far East, Britain, which has a long history of a hundred years in Asia and whose rights and interests are several times greater than those of the United States, should take this opportunity to further cooperate closely with the United States and other democratic countries such as the Soviet Union and France, and adopt a tough policy to quickly sanction the violent Japan. Not only will the rights and interests of the British Empire in China be protected from damage, but the war can be ended sooner, and many innocent people in China can be spared the tragic death under the brutal planes and artillery of the Japanese militarists!

Since Mr. Leith-Ross helped China reform its currency system in November 1935, there has been a closer economic relationship between China and Britain than in the past, and British investment in China has been increasing day by day. In recent years, British investment has been the largest in the capital for railway construction in China. In terms of trade, in 1936, the year before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, exports from the UK and its major colonies to China accounted for 21.62% of China's total imports, and imports from China accounted for 31.87% of China's total exports. The total of exports and imports accounted for 26.01% of China's foreign trade, ranking first compared with the US and Japan. The United States was second, and Japan was third. Even after the outbreak of the war, until the first half of 1938, British trade with China still ranked first. As for 80% of the total Chinese bank capital of 760 million and 60% of the industrial capital were in Shanghai under British influence. According to the statistics of 1936, the UK also ranked first in the shipping power on the coast and inland rivers of China, more than twice that of Japan. However, since Japan launched its war of aggression, the UK's transportation capacity has gradually decreased to less than a quarter by the first half of last year. After the loss of Wuhan and Guangzhou, British influence in China was almost completely driven out by Japan, and the losses in Hong Kong were even greater. Recently, the Japanese militarists have intensified their efforts, using military relations as an excuse to block the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, not allowing foreign ships to sail, and using all kinds of despicable means to exclude foreign businessmen from operating businesses. All travel and residence of foreigners in the occupied areas are subject to various restrictions, so that they will cut off their traces as soon as possible. If the Japanese militarists can permanently occupy the occupied areas of China today, then no place will be allowed for foreigners to have room for activity! The opposition of British businessmen to the deceptive "new order" promoted by the Japanese militarists and their advocacy of a tough policy are appropriate measures.

The mad fascist Kiichirō Hiranuma has replaced Konoe as Prime Minister. In this final stage of struggle, the Japanese military's war of aggression against China will be more intense and brutal, and the exclusion of foreign interests will be more active. In fact, the first to bear the brunt will naturally be the United States and Britain, especially Britain, which has the most rights and interests in China. Yesterday, the Japanese "Tokyo Newspaper" boldly stated: Regardless of how the United States opposes it, regardless of how the United States and Britain adopt cooperation methods, the Japanese government is determined to adhere to its determination to establish a new order in East Asia. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" also made similar remarks, saying that Japan will continue to advance towards the path of organizing the "Japan-Manchukuo-China Economic Group" according to its determination, and stated that the first voice of the Hiranuma Cabinet to the outside world would be a firm rejection of the US note of the 31st of last month. Japan's development in the Far East and the interests of Britain and the United States are absolutely incompatible, which is already clear. On the 4th, US President Roosevelt's speech in Congress seemed to imply that the United States would impose economic sanctions on Japan and Germany, and the movement for sanctions against Japan in the United States is becoming more enthusiastic. Since the United States is prepared to impose severe sanctions on Japan, if the United Kingdom ×××××××××××, France will certainly be able to participate, and the Soviet Union, which has always advocated peace, has no reason to stay out of it. If this is the case, the rights and interests of the United Kingdom in the East can be protected, and world peace can be re-established. The time has come, and the wise British politicians must have "a well-thought-out plan in mind"!

### Guilin Impressions

— Zheng Zhangqun

[Special Correspondence from Guilin] After we arrived in Guilin, many friends, regardless of whether we knew them or not, local or from Hengyang and other places, almost invariably asked us about the truth of the war situation and the prospects for the war of resistance.

[Is there any talk of "peace"?] "Is peace possible?"

We heard such questions everywhere. This, to us who had just left Ganzhou, a city full of refugees and wailing souls in the wilderness; and Wuzhou and Liuzhou, which were experiencing air raid alarms several times a day and were filled with grief and indignation, was like a bolt from the blue. The hateful rumour-mongers were acting as if it were true, and no matter how we explained it, the air of compromise and peace still hung heavily over the hearts of the people of Guilin. Those who were well-fed and hoping for "peace" out of selfish motives had become the broadcasting stations for spreading rumours, even detailing the conditions for "peace": first, second… fifth. "Peace" was not only hoped for by our side; the × people, finding themselves in a difficult position, were also hoping for it. They spoke with an air of "knowing oneself and knowing the enemy." They said that a certain director had received secret information confirming that the rumours were not false, that a certain important person had stopped the planned relocation to the countryside, and that a certain chief had also hinted at the imminent arrival of "peace" during a commemorative week. They exhausted their efforts to present the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan as the basis for the inevitable arrival of "peace," and this spread like wildfire. It was as if "everything was settled." In this atmosphere, even those who were considered to have a deeper understanding of current affairs were inevitably misled and began to waver. This created a situation where the whole of Guilin was plunged into a quagmire of confusion. We believe that this is a phenomenon that absolutely must not be allowed to happen, especially in Guilin, which is meant to be the base for the future war of resistance, as the second phase of the war of resistance is just beginning. Therefore, we did our best to explain and correct the rumours. In recent days, we have emphasized the following points in our conversations with individuals, visits to social organizations and government agencies, and meetings with public officials, in order to illustrate that we are determined to persevere in the war of resistance to the end, and that only by fighting to the end can we achieve final victory.

First, compromise is enough to destroy the country - Under the current circumstances, there is absolutely no benefit for us to be gained from any peace negotiations. The × people, believing that they have won, will surely place us in the position of "signing a treaty under the city walls." In reality, the distinction between victory and defeat is not yet decided. Moreover, today's results were expected before the war of resistance, as a necessary process during the war of resistance. We are willing to make any sacrifice and resolutely fight because of the independence of the country, and the restoration of national dignity. Unless those goals are achieved, we must not stop fighting. The facts of the past year and a half, although we have suffered many losses, show that we are becoming stronger as we fight, and the morale is higher than ever before. The restoration of the nation has begun to show signs of progress. If compromise is possible today, there would have been no war of resistance. Who doesn't understand that our war of resistance is to seek life in death, and compromise is tantamount to giving up the only way to survive and heading to one's death. Who doesn't understand that the internal contradictions and difficulties of the × people will continue to be revealed as we continue to resist. This is enough for us to resolutely see through the path of "compromise midway, enough to destroy the country" and actively implement the mission of long-term resistance.

Second, the defeatists have not been completely eliminated - Trees do not move without wind. The rumours of "peace" certainly did not come out of thin air. Because there are still defeatists in our ranks, and there are still people among our officials and scholars who are unwilling to let go of the illusion of "peace." This is the breeding ground for "peace" and compromise. However, these defeatists initially attempted "peace" because they could not resist the tide of resisting × and saving the nation. In other words, the objective situation was all geared towards resistance, and it was clear that resistance was the only way to establish oneself and survive. Therefore, the defeatists' advocacy of peace never had a chance to succeed. The current objective situation has not only not changed in the slightest from before the war of resistance, but has strengthened the demand for resistance. In addition, all parties and factions can cooperate more sincerely, and the national consciousness among the people has increased dramatically. All of this is enough to give a major blow to those who advocate peace. Therefore, we say that although those who advocate peace are still agitating, the crisis of compromise may not have been completely eliminated. But the objective situation of resistance has not diminished, and compromise is absolutely impossible.

Third, the dawn of victory is faintly visible. In this year or so of war of resistance, we have learned everything. Not only has there been considerable progress in military strategies for fighting the × people. There are signs of gradual enlightenment in politics, that is, internally we also know who is patriotic and who is a traitor, and corrupt elements are gradually being eliminated, and patriotic people are gradually having their chance to show their abilities. These are all predictions of victory. Although we still have many weaknesses that cannot be tolerated, it is a fact that everyone can recognize them and is gradually eliminating them and gradually improving them. Our strength is infinite. Now we are gradually learning the technique of using this force. Everyone understands that the only condition for the victory of the war of resistance is whether or not the mission of general mobilization can be completed. But this most difficult task of general mobilization is already being actively worked on and will surely bear fruit.

Based on many facts, we cited the remarks of the supreme leader to prove that after the fall of Guangzhou and Hankou, we will inevitably continue to resist, and that it will not hinder the conditions for the victory of the war of resistance. Here, we want to specifically point out that the Guangxi Daily in Guilin can also play the mission of leading public opinion and correcting rumours. I remember it was November 8th (?), the newspaper published an editorial in a solemn and straightforward manner, entitled "Eliminating Defeatists." The content of the article stated the facts that persisting in the war of resistance to the end will surely lead to final victory, and the conclusion pointed out that it is excusable for ignorant people to misunderstand rumours and seek trouble for themselves. However, it is unforgivable for public officials, even those in leadership positions, to waver in their confidence in the future of the war of resistance, not only showing their lack of common sense, but also influencing people's hearts. We admire the newspaper's correct arguments and far-sighted vision. However, judging from the facts pointed out by the newspaper, it can be seen how strong the "peace" atmosphere was in Guilin at that time, and that there were many people who believed in rumours.

Facts speak louder than eloquence. Rumours, after all, cannot escape the scope of rumours. Chairman Chiang's letter to the people and the resolutions of the Political Council, like sunshine, swept away the "peace" mist that enveloped Guilin. In particular, after Chairman Huang returned from Changsha (at that time, it was widely rumoured in Guilin that the Changsha meeting attended by Chairman Huang was to decide on the issue of war or peace), the "peace" atmosphere immediately disappeared into thin air. Later, more and more people came to Guilin from Hengyang. We learned from Chairman Huang and many others about the new strategies decided at the Changsha meeting for the second phase of the war of resistance. It is said that our decision to fight to the end this time is based on three important factors: (1) The combat power of the × people is declining day by day. According to statistics from the battlefields of Shanghai, Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Hankou, it is almost becoming a declining line. On the contrary, our side is gradually increasing, and a certain army that has never participated in the war in the past and has been recuperating has decided to participate in the war. Therefore, we are confident in resisting or counterattacking: (2) In terms of the supply of military supplies, although there have been changes and difficulties due to international routes, the military supplies we have obtained have been imported at 70% of the planned amount, which is sufficient for several years: (3) There is confidence in solving financial and economic problems. This is not only in terms of foreign aid, but also in terms of our own strength, there are still many good policies to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, which will not hinder the war of resistance; (4) Domestic unity is becoming closer. Representatives of the Eighth Route Army, such as Zhou Enlai, participated in the Changsha meeting, which was an unprecedented phenomenon.

The many messages listed above were passed on from reliable people, confirming our explanation and strengthening our determination to resist. The atmosphere in Guilin has changed from pessimistic, negative, and wavering to tense, positive, and calm.

The provincial government had long foreseen the brutality of enemy air raids on Guilin. In addition to organizing the people to take refuge in an organized manner, it also decided to evacuate women and children. In addition, the military situation in Yueyang was extremely tight, and the shocking fire in Changsha occurred one after another in a short period of time, and Guilin was naturally subjected to tremendous shocks, forming an orderly wavering. Showing another kind of unusual phenomenon.

The crowds pouring in from Hengyang, the words "torrent" and "sea of people" are really not enough to describe even one ten-thousandth of it. What was then manifested in Guilin was the problem of food and housing.

Since the beginning of the war of resistance, the small city of Guilin has seen new restaurants springing up like bamboo shoots after the rain. Together with the existing ones, the total number has exceeded one hundred. No matter when you step into these hundred or so restaurants, big or small, the first impression is that they are full. Sometimes, if you are lucky enough to find a seat, after waiting impatiently for some time, the dishes you ordered arrive one after another. After you finish the first bowl of rice, the second bowl either requires you to wait some more time, or you will get this perfunctory answer: "The rice is not ready... It's too late... Wait another thirty minutes." No matter how much you are willing to pay, it is never easy to get your fill. This is the problem of food. As for the problem of accommodation, there is a similar situation. The newly established hotels are not few in number. However, at 11 o'clock in the evening, the doors are always tightly closed. At two or three o'clock in the middle of the night, the guests pouring in from the Xiang-Gui Road break down the door with their fists, but the hotel owner still pretends to be deaf and dumb. Later, the people looking for a room understood that they had to shout loudly outside the hotel door, "Mr. So-and-so," indicating that they were looking for a friend. As soon as the hotel owner opened the door, they swarmed in, and in the accounting room, on the corridor, in any place where there was an empty space, they spread out their bedding and slept. "How much money do you want, I'll give you how much." The hotel owner was indeed unable to cope, and could open his mouth and ask for a rental fee of one or two yuan per night at will, and was happy to pretend to be deaf and dumb again. The prices of all items, compared to before the war, are said to have increased many times, but this is not a problem for the travelers, only the poor locals suffer.

In addition to food and housing, what is not easy to solve in Guilin is the transportation problem. The locals have long understood that the wooden houses in Guilin cannot withstand burning, and since the government has decided to evacuate, everyone is of course rushing to leave Guilin. The people from Hengyang, except for a very small number who stayed in Guilin to work, were mostly passing through, resulting in fewer cars than passengers, and transportation has become a serious problem that is difficult to solve. The population flowing into Guilin from various places is in the thousands every day, but the number of cars leaving Guilin is no more than two per day, of course, it cannot solve the problem of evacuation. According to reliable sources, tickets from Liuzhou to Guiyang have been registered until March next year. People whose destination is Chongqing or Kunming cannot solve the problem by walking, so they can only stay in Guilin. This adds to the difficulties of food and housing. There are many people wandering on the streets because they have run out of travel expenses, and there are many who are begging for mercy. Although the Guangxi authorities have regulations on the reception of refugees and the establishment of reception centers, what they can solve is only the tip of the problem.

Finally, we want to point out that there are still many serious and urgent problems that need to be solved and are very easy to solve.

(1) The difficulty in solving the problem of food and housing lies in the fact that there is no prevention or interference with the hoarding of goods by various business owners, and many public institutions, such as guild halls and temples, are still allowed to remain empty without being utilized. This is a great loss. If these places can be utilized more systematically, and at the same time, the management methods of hotels and restaurants can be distributed, the problem of food and housing can be easily solved.

(2) Like monsters, trucks retreating from the front to the rear have the words "Military Abandonment" on the front, but most of the contents they carry are sofas, wooden furniture, leather suitcases, and buckets. It is said that many important items lack military personnel and cannot be transported out, but carrying these things is really heartbreaking. With the price of electricity and oil being very high and in short supply today, carrying furniture is really not worth the price of electricity and oil. This unreasonable phenomenon must be paid attention to by those in charge.

(3) Electricity and oil are very expensive and in short supply. The call to save electricity and oil and to control electricity and oil is deafening, but we still see young masters and young ladies driving around for pleasure.

(4) Electricity and oil are very scarce in Guilin, and each can sells for 20 yuan in national currency. Sometimes you can't buy spot goods even if you have money. It is said that there is a lot of stock in Longzhou, and each can only sells for 8 yuan. But we see many empty cars returning from Longzhou to Guilin. Why can't we use them to transport oil to make up for the shortage? This is a serious organizational problem. Electricity and oil are just one example, and other materials have the same strange phenomenon.

(5) Transportation is very scarce. However, there are still cases of fraud in car dealerships, even in official road bureaus. For example, from Xupu to Guilin, the fixed price is 6 yuan and 7 jiao in national currency, but some people have paid 25 yuan in national currency. It is said that car tickets are first bought out by people and then sold at high prices. Therefore, some passengers cannot find a place to buy tickets, even if they are willing to pay a high price, they cannot get them, and they have stayed in extremely simple small hotels for seven or eight days. However, in this situation of such crowded passengers, due to the above-mentioned fraud, there are actually empty seats in the car when it drives out. This is the reality that is happening in our ideal Guangxi. It is said that other places are even more chaotic. This is a phenomenon that must be corrected quickly!

### Xie Jinyuan, Leader of the Isolated Army in Shanghai, Observations and Thoughts on the Current Situation over the Past Year

(Shanghai Correspondence of this Newspaper) Time flies like water. The twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China has arrived in an instant. Because of mental uneasiness, I was hospitalized for treatment. Following the doctor's advice, I eliminated all the complexities. As for colleagues in the media requesting me to write an article stating my observations over the past year, I was unable to comply for a while. Recently, colleagues in the isolated island have been frequently asking about the truth and future trends due to Wang Jingwei's defection. I am always optimistic about the future of the war of resistance. I have said in the past that our country's military has absolute confidence in victory. If there are any problems, it is in politics. But political problems are not irredeemable. Because our country has a large population and vast space, after a long period of war of resistance, it will be able to make all political problems get on the right track along with the development of the military. In particular, today's soldiers in our country are inspired by the great selfless spirit of our supreme leader, and the revolutionary education of national and national supremacy has made the thinking of modern soldiers almost advance by leaps and bounds. As for Wang's past, he only took a part of the responsibility in the party and the country. The words and actions of the Ning-Han split, and the measures of the enlarged meeting, when proved by today's escape, the impact on the major strategy of resisting the war and building the country is, at most, to confuse the public and give the enemy an opportunity to provoke and create rumors.

I believe that Wang is an idealistic empty talker, lacking a strong and consistent revolutionary belief. Judging from his past revolutionary history, he should not abandon his people and associate with traitors. Especially at this critical juncture of the country, it is by no means that one or two telegrams or lengthy speeches can help. Wang's move is enough to expose the declining fate of a few wavering elements within the country, and make the foundation of domestic unity against foreign aggression stronger. I originally had an article "The Knowledge that the Chinese People Should Have During the War of Resistance," which was to be published on New Year's Day, but it did not materialize due to illness. In short, the people in this great era should have an absolutely rational and calm mind to grasp their beliefs and clarify right and wrong. If they are overly nervous and ignore reality, it will only trap the country in the great disease of frivolity, impetuosity, and empty talk. I especially hope that the media will strive to take the initiative and bear the responsibility. For all confusing and incomplete news, do not exaggerate too much, lest it shake the people's confidence in the war of resistance. The current all-out war of resistance was originally a consistent policy of the government. Five years ago, there were detailed plans. Therefore, Wang's every word and action will never affect the national policy of resisting the war. This is just a clear division between the virtuous and the traitors in the process of resisting the war. Today, we must recognize that only by vowing to support Chairman Chiang can we win the final victory in the war of resistance. Chairman Chiang is the only great man who continues the past and opens up the future, carries forward and promotes the 5,000-year history and culture of our country, and is the leader who lays the foundation for the prosperity of the nation for generations to come. The people must recognize that the soul of the nation and the nation is tied to Chairman Chiang. Chairman Chiang's soul is also the soul of our nation and the people. From now on, the people can only follow the meaning of "the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of everyone," and do their duty in their respective positions, exhaust their duties, and take the supreme leader's advocacy as their advocacy, and their will as their will, and work hard to serve the country in a down-to-earth manner. Fellow islanders, at the beginning of this year, I hope that everyone will review the responsibilities they have fulfilled in the year and a half of the war of resistance. At a time when hundreds of thousands of frontline soldiers are fighting to the death, and tens of millions of compatriots in the war zone are displaced, can the islanders watch the fire from across the bank by virtue of their special environment? Staying on the island, I sincerely appeal to the islanders that the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China will be the year of our country's war of resistance and national construction. I deeply hope that the islanders will step up their efforts to serve the motherland and contribute money and effort to complete the foundation of national mobilization. In particular, the movement to repay debts of one yuan is even more the duty of every citizen, and must be promoted universally, extending to the old and the young. Then, by gathering small contributions, the combination of the power of 450 million people will surely form a strong Great Wall, and the future of the war of resistance will surely be promising. Otherwise, if the country is destroyed and the family is destroyed, I am afraid that we will become the second Jews, and we may not even be able to obtain that. As the New Year begins, I deeply hope that my compatriots will strive for it.

### The Southwest Economic Construction Committee Engages in Developing Rich Resources. Six Provinces have Very Abundant Reserves. Inconvenient Transportation and Backward Industry are the Main Reasons.

Our government has established the Southwest Economic Construction Committee to develop and build the southwest and enhance the strength of the war of resistance. The ministers of various departments and the chairmen of the southwest provinces have been appointed as members. Preparations have been completed and the committee will be established in Chongqing on New Year's Day of the 28th year. In addition to the government issuing huge sums of money as funds, Hu Wenhu invested 50 million yuan, and various banks decided to assist in the completion. The details are as follows:

Agriculture The total area of the six provinces is 260 million mu, and the cultivated area is 31.7 million mu, accounting for 15% of the total area. The situation in each province is the highest in Guangxi, accounting for 25%, the lowest in Yunnan, accounting for 4%, and others such as Guangdong accounting for 12%, Hunan accounting for 13%, Guizhou accounting for 8%, and Sichuan accounting for 15%. The main agricultural product is rice.

Rice accounts for 47% of the national output, of which Guangdong ranks first, Sichuan Province ranks second, and Hunan Province ranks third. Although silk and tea are specialties of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, the silk of Sichuan and Guangdong and the tea of Hunan and Hubei are also quite famous. In addition, the most important agricultural product is tung oil. Sichuan Province alone produces up to 600,000 dan per year. As for cotton production, it is very small. Sichuan produces about 750,000 dan, Hunan produces about 400,000 dan, and Guangdong produces only 6,000 dan.

Industry

Industry is extremely weak due to the competition from foreign goods and foreign capital. This situation is especially true in the southwest provinces. Although there are few foreigners who set up factories in these six provinces, the competition from imported foreign goods is very fierce. The main reason for the backwardness of industry in the southwest provinces is the backwardness of transportation. It is inconvenient to obtain raw materials and circulate products. Therefore, industry has a feeling of being difficult to stand on its own. The largest modern industrial yarn factories in the southwest provinces are only two, namely Guangdong Textile Factory and Hunan First Textile Factory. The newly established ones later are Hunan Hengzhong Iron Works, Sichuan Jiabin Textile Factory, and Yunnan Textile Factory. The flour mills are Hunan First Factory in Changsha and Xinxin Flour Mill in Changde. However, sugar mills are more developed, but they are also limited to Sichuan and Guangdong provinces. Alcohol factories are mainly in Guangdong and Guangxi, and Hunan and Sichuan are also planning. Sichuan has the most match factories, with a total of 46 factories. Hunan and Guangxi each have one factory, Guangdong has one or five, and Yunnan has eight factories. In addition, there are about 200 factories for papermaking, silk reeling, sulphuric acid, brick making, rubber, cement machinery, etc.

Mining The mineral resources in the southwest provinces are extremely rich, with gold, silver, steel, iron, tin, manganese, zinc, lead, coal, petroleum, and salt. In particular, tin, manganese, antimony, etc. occupy a very high position in the world. Coal and iron are not as prosperous as in the northern provinces. (1) Iron ore reserves are about 299.616 million tons, (2) Coal reserves are about 1.5535 billion tons, (3) Manganese ore production is about 31,200 tons per year, (4) Antimony ore production is about 1,825 tons per year, (5) Gold production is about 31,206 taels per year, (6) Silver production is about 121,504 taels per year, (7) Tungsten production is about 11,410 tons per year, (8) Tin production is about 7,398 tons per year, (9) Antimony production is about 13,260 tons per year, (10) Lead production is about 6,670 tons per year, (11) Bismuth production is about 1,305 tons per year, (12) Petroleum production is about 400 barrels per year.

Transportation

The railways in the six provinces are insufficient and lack connection, and other transportation tools are not perfect. Therefore, to develop the rich resources in the southwest, it is advisable to engage in construction. (1) Railways The railways recently started by the government are the Chuanhai Railway from Xufu, Sichuan to Kunming, Yunnan, the Dianmian Railway from Kunming, Yunnan to Myitkyina, Burma, the Xiangqian Railway from Hengzhou, Hunan to Guiyang, Guizhou, and the Guiqian Railway from Guiyang, Guizhou to Kunming, Yunnan. Those in the plan are the Sichuan-Gui Railway, the Guiqian Railway, the Guangdong-Yue Railway, and the Shicheng Guide Railway. (2) Highways The highways in the southwest are more developed than in other provinces. The six provinces have a total of about 27,000 kilometers of roads that have been opened to traffic, accounting for one-quarter of the country, such as the Gandian Road, the Chuangui Road, the Guichuang Road, the Xianggui Road, the Chuanxiang Road, the Chuandian Road, the Yuegan Road, the Egang Road, the Xiange Road, the Guibei Road, the Shaanqian Road, the Guihong Road, and the Chuan'e Road. The newly completed ones are the Burma Road.

### Assassination Cases in Shanghai Break Records. Last Year Can Be Called a Year of Terror

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 6th] Last year was the year with the most political crimes in the history of Shanghai. There were 37 assassination cases and attempted assassination cases. Both China and Japan tried to consolidate their political positions, resulting in mutual shootings. This political incident was the sacrifice of war. There was one former Prime Minister, one general, 20 Chinese officials who sold out the country, and many other people of all countries, such as educators, bankers, businessmen, and lawyers. Among them were those who had studied in the United States. This situation is extremely complicated, because not only are there conflicts between pro-Japanese and anti-Japanese people, but also pro-Japanese people often have conflicts due to political struggles for status.

### Victory Reported on Two Routes in Northeastern Guangdong: Counter-Offensive Military Operations Continue to Progress; Xijiang [West River] × Increases Attempts to Encroach on Guangxi

[North River Quick Dispatch] Our military counter-offensive against Guangdong has entered a new stage, with considerable gains in Zengcheng on the eastern route and Conghua on the northern route. Zhang Fakui, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Zone, has been convening senior generals at the base for several days to discuss further strategies for counter-attacking Guangzhou. It has been decided to take advantage of the momentum and advance on Guangzhou with the main force from the northeast on two routes, employing a large encirclement strategy. Detailed military plans have been finalized and distributed to generals on all routes for implementation. It is reported that after our forces on the eastern route defeated the main force of the Zengcheng ×, they have continued to advance. Meanwhile, in the Longmen-Conghua area, a unit of our army has also launched a large-scale southward advance, with one detachment reaching the Zhengguo-Tiantou area and another reaching Paitan. Thus, the left flank of the northern route has linked up with our eastern route forces, completely encircling the periphery of Guangzhou's × troops with a long, diagonal line. After further deployment and replenishment, they will launch a coordinated assault on Guangzhou. As for the Xijiang area, although a large number of × reinforcements have arrived in the Sanshui-Xinan-Makou area, attempting to advance westward into Guangxi and outflank the right wing of our northern route, we have strong defensive positions in Gaoyao, Gaoming, and Heshan. × will certainly not succeed. Currently, the Guangdong war situation is developing into a rapid advance in the northeast and a defensive posture in the southwest.

[Wengyuan Quick Dispatch] According to a high-ranking official from the Fourth War Zone Command whom I interviewed, after the abandonment of Guangzhou and Wuhan, our second phase of the War of Resistance began, and nearly three months have passed. The war situation in Hunan, Hubei, and South China has stabilized and is rapidly shifting from a passive to an active position. This is due to the results of our implementation of a strategy combining mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare. Investigations reveal that the × troops on the northern section of the Yuehan Railway and those in Naxi have suffered repeated heavy blows in Yuezhou, Pingjiang, Xiangyin, and Zaoshi, with casualties exceeding 100,000. On the southern section of the Yuehan Railway and in Zengcheng and Dongguan on the eastern route, units under the Fourth War Zone have advanced towards Guangzhou in separate columns. Simultaneously, guerrilla teams in various districts have advanced to the outskirts of Guangzhou and the key points of Humen. Therefore, the × troops find it extremely difficult to operate in Guangdong. Recently, they planned to shorten the outer defense line of Guangzhou and increase reinforcements of naval fleets, attempting to land on the coasts of Beihai, Dianbai, and Yangjiang on the southern route, in a delusional attempt to invade Guangxi and cut off our southwestern international lines of communication. However, they retreated without success. In the past week, × has again withdrawn troops from Guangzhou, Zengcheng, and Dongguan to reinforce Jiujiang and Sanshui, desperately launching a westward attack on Gaoyao in the hope of opening up the Xijiang route to invade Guangxi and make a final military struggle. However, western Guangdong has strategic terrain and strong troops. To the east, the mountains on both sides of the Lingyang Gorge face each other, choking the flow of the East River, with a momentum like a galloping horse. The terrain is similar to the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. Guangxi is also mountainous, with complex ravines. If mountain warfare is launched, it will not be suitable for the heavy weapons of the × army, and × will inevitably suffer heavy losses.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in Western Shanxi; ×'s Advance Has Been Repulsed and Most Are Fleeing Northward; Traces of × Discovered at Various Passes East of the Yellow River

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 5th] Military intelligence reports that the number of × troops attacking the Lüliang Mountains this time is approximately 7,000 or more. They began operations on the 25th and 26th of last month. One force of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 troops attacked Tumen-Heilongguan from Linfen, while another force infiltrated Guojiazhuang from Xiangling. Another force attacked Xiangning from Jishan, and another attacked Xigukou from Hejin, with approximately 4,000 to 5,000 troops on these two routes. After being severely attacked by our forces, the × troops at Changjiazhuang turned north to join up with the × troops at Linfen and invaded Puxian-Daning, suffering heavy casualties from constant ambushes by our troops along the way. Tumen and Heilongguan have been successively recovered by our forces, and the × troops' rear route has been cut off, causing great panic. The × troops that attacked north from Jishan joined up with the × troops at Xigukou and successively invaded Xiangning-Jixian on the 30th and 31st, attempting to continue their westward invasion. After three days of fierce fighting, the × troops were greatly repulsed, and most of the remaining × troops fled northward, seemingly intending to join up with the forces at Daning and attack the ferry crossing. The Shanxi × troops also increased by more than 5,000 on the 25th of last month, with one part increasing troops in Lishi-Zhongyang and another increasing troops in Jiugu to attack Xixian. After being severely attacked by our forces at Shijiazhuang, the × troops that advanced from Lishi on the 29th through Shiguan have taken no further action. According to reports, a unit of the × troops at Shilou infiltrated Xinguang, where they are currently engaged in battle with one of our units.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 4th] Around New Year's Day, our forces took advantage of the × troops' unpreparedness and launched surprise attacks on the section between Ningwu and Shuoxian, inflicting heavy damage on the × troops. (1) Our detachment destroyed four or five miles of the Dashahe Railway, cut seven or eight miles of electric wires, and destroyed a certain place on the 2nd at Yangfangkou. Approximately 2,000 jin of electric wires and iron wires were transported back. (2) The × troops at Qianzhai were surrounded and attacked by our unit on the 2nd. After more than two hours of fierce fighting, the × troops were defeated and fled towards the station. Many × troops were killed in this battle, and many spoils of war were seized. (3) Our unit destroyed about a mile of railway and three miles of electric wires north of Ningwu. The transportation of × troops between Shuo and Ning has now been blocked.

[Central News Agency, Changde, 5th] According to reports from the front lines, two small gunboats of the × army patrolling the river in the Xindi, Bailuoji, Chenglingji, and Yueyang areas have now retreated downstream. The discipline of the × army in Xindi is extremely poor. For days, they have been looting food and property in the surrounding villages in batches, causing unbearable suffering to the residents, who are fleeing one after another.

[Central News Agency, Zhanggongdu, 5th] (1) After our Lushan guerrilla unit won a victory in an attack on the ×, the × quickly gathered more than 700 troops and launched a large-scale counter-attack on our Baoguo Temple and Biyu Temple. Our regiment bravely engaged them in fierce fighting throughout the afternoon. The × suffered heavy casualties and retreated towards the Lanqiao area. (2) On the 1st, our guerrilla detachment of a certain army attacked the × at Fumu Pass and Baicha in separate columns. After defeating the ×, we retreated to our positions on the 3rd after completing our mission. The × troops in that area are very afraid of our Jinan team. They have secretly deployed sentries and are scattered in fortifications at night.

[Central News Agency, Zhanggongdu, 5th] After being destroyed by our guerrilla unit, the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway has been unable to operate for two days. Currently, the × troops are sending teams to provide cover and actively repair the railway. The riverbank from Qiujin west to Guohuashi has also been almost completely destroyed by our artillery fire. The remaining × troops resumed repairs on the 2nd, but they were hit by our artillery fire again, causing heavy casualties.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang, 6th] On the 6th, our guerrilla unit launched an attack on the De'an-Xiushui Highway from a certain place. Near Daoshanshan, seven kilometers southwest of De'an, they encountered a × artillery regiment heading south for reinforcement. We intercepted them with hand grenades and broadswords. The × troops were suddenly unable to withstand the attack, and their soldiers and horses were in chaos. Our officers and soldiers took advantage of the situation to charge and engage in close combat, killing more than ten × soldiers, eight horses, and capturing two × soldiers: Takahashi Shinichi and Itano Ichiro. One artillery piece was destroyed, and eight rifles and other military flags, diaries, riding boots, amulets, and other items were seized. We only had a few wounded soldiers.

### Wang Zhaoming Is About to Issue a Statement Attacking the Kuomintang-Communist Cooperation

[Foreign News from This Port] It is heard that Wang Jingwei will issue an article tomorrow (today) denying that he is a traitor and intending to explain his reasons for going to Hanoi. Wang will also attack the activities of the Communist Party in China, saying that the greatest danger to China is communism. Communist leader Zhou Enlai is now asking Chairman Jiang to issue a declaration stating that the Three Principles of the People are communism. Furthermore, Wang will accuse the Communist Party, claiming that the Party has drafted a plan to confiscate all private deposits in banks, including foreign banks in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

[Special Report from This Newspaper] According to sources close to Wang, whether the above document will be published today is still under consideration.

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 5th Special Dispatch] (Delayed) The consulate in Hanoi telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reporting that Wang's subordinates in Hanoi are being ridiculed by public opinion, abandoned by the Chinese people, and are extremely frustrated. Chen ×× and Zhou ×× are still desperately working for him. As of the 5th, telegrams from various parties inside and outside the country have been sent to the Central Government and the Executive Yuan, requesting that Wang be publicly condemned. Overseas Chinese communities are particularly indignant.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 6th] According to Chinese official sources, Wang Jingwei plans to convene the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang in Hong Kong in mid-month, in direct conflict with the Fifth Plenary Session that the Chinese official government in Chongqing plans to convene. The spokesperson believes that Wang intends to become the leader of a puppet central government controlled by the Japanese, and that Wu Peifu (?), Zhou Fohai (!), and those currently in Hong Kong protecting Wang will jointly organize it. However, it is predicted that this move will have no impact on China's united front.

Guo and Hu Refute Rumors

[Reuters, London, 5th] The Chinese Embassy issued a statement today denying that "Ambassador Guo Taiqi telegraphed Chairman Jiang requesting acceptance of Wang Jingwei's conditions."

### X Consul in Hong Kong Talks: Gunfire Frequently Heard in Guangzhou; Our Guerrillas Active; × Feels It Difficult to Cope

[Local News] Transportation between Guangzhou and Hong Kong and Macau has not yet resumed as of now. On the Guangdong-Macau line, under the control of the ×, there is only one × transport ship making round trips once a week, each time limited to carrying 30 passengers, and foreigners are refused passage, except for Chinese, Japanese, and Portuguese people. According to yesterday's report in the Hong Kong Telegraph, the issue of resuming shipping between Guangdong and Hong Kong has recently made slight progress. Hong Kong officials have not denied this statement, but a final decision has yet to be made. The newspaper also quoted a Japanese Consul in Hong Kong as saying that the date of successful resumption of shipping between Guangdong and Hong Kong will be after December, and that the Japanese side is actively negotiating with Hong Kong to request permission to resume shipping.

### British Newspaper Predicts: Once Japan Is Defeated, It Will Become a Socialist Country

[Reuters, London, 6th] The Birmingham Post stated that Konoe resigned because he was unwilling to take responsibility for the military's plans. His appointment as Minister without Portfolio in the new cabinet is also for this reason. The new cabinet plans to accept any military or naval signature regarding domestic or foreign concessions. If Japan can defeat China, it will become a dictatorship. If Japan fails, a reaction will inevitably arise and it will become a socialist or even a communist country. Therefore, there is no hope for democratic politics in Japan in the future. [Reuters, Berlin, 5th] Germany expressed satisfaction with the personnel of the Japanese cabinet. The appointment of Baron Hiranuma, an experienced politician, and Arida, who created the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact two years ago, was welcomed. They also expect that the policy on the war against China will not be changed. The German Allgemeine Zeitung praised the rapid resolution of this political turmoil and said that the selection of the Japanese Minister of Finance is extremely important, because since the war against China, financial problems have become extremely difficult. Berlin local newspapers stated that the lineup of the Japanese cabinet shows that Japan has not yet compromised politically.

### Hiranuma Announces After First Cabinet Meeting: Acknowledges That the Current Situation Has Become Difficult to Handle

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Tokyo report: After holding its first cabinet meeting tonight, Prime Minister Hiranuma issued a statement saying, "The critical juncture Japan is in today is unprecedented in history. It is not easy to overcome the current situation. However, I firmly believe that the government and the people, united under the guidance of the Emperor and expressing their traditional national spirit, can overcome this difficulty. History shows that whenever the country is in a time of crisis, Japan has been able to unite and cope. The country's institutions have also been strengthened as a result. The current situation is the most urgent in history, so the country needs further unity. The general policy of the new cabinet will be announced at an appropriate time. However, at present, all national resources must be concentrated to achieve Japan's 'China' objectives. As for ending the 'China Incident,' the new cabinet will implement the unchanged policies drafted by the previous cabinet and approved by the Emperor."

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Foreign news from Tokyo: Yesterday evening, Japan's new Prime Minister Hiranuma Ichiro told reporters that the reason why former Prime Minister Konoe agreed to remain in the new cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio was to show the outside world that the Japanese cabinet would continue to handle everything according to the old cabinet's general policies. The new cabinet will adhere to the policies set by the Imperial Conference without wavering, especially in the matter of adjusting relations with China.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 6th] Foreign news from Tokyo: Today, the new Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma had a meeting with former Prime Minister Konoe. The two reached a consensus on the previous cabinet's policy on the Sino-Japanese conflict, stating that the two had exchanged opinions. The Japanese media believes that the new cabinet is a mixed cabinet of Hiranuma and Konoe, or a continuation of the Konoe cabinet. Eight of the twelve members of the new cabinet were members of the Konoe cabinet. Two former Vice-Ministers (Ishiwatari Sotaro and Hirose Hisada) were promoted to ministers. Konoe is expected to be appointed Chairman of the Privy Council, but at the same time will attend future cabinet meetings as a Minister without Portfolio.

### Chen Yi Inspects Fujian Province: Discusses This Year's Plans

[Central News Agency, Yanping, 5th] Since the War of Resistance, the authorities in Fujian Province have implemented a policy of strengthening internal facilities in preparation for a prolonged war. In the past year, they have done their best to mobilize manpower and resources and focus on this. Governor of Fujian Chen Yi recently inspected various places on the inner lines at the beginning of the new year. When a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed him yesterday, he asked about the results of this policy and inquired about plans to promote the work of various departments this year. According to him, the main work of last year was to recruit soldiers and organize and train the people. Recruiting soldiers is the first priority for supporting the war. Therefore, all sixty-plus counties in the province focused on this point last year. Many of the recruits sent by the counties each month volunteered to enlist and pledged to kill the enemy, and many exceeded the quota, while none failed to meet the quota. This shows the efforts of the propaganda and management personnel, and it is especially gratifying that the people have become more aware. The management personnel immediately punished any abuses they discovered, seeking to eliminate evil and be impartial. Organizing and training the people is the basic work for mobilizing the people to resist the war and implementing a comprehensive war of resistance. In the past year, this has been actively carried out, with the people's education as the center of the work, and the forces of other groups have been gathered. Most of the people in the province, regardless of gender or age, have received new training. This is progressing rapidly in both large cities and remote areas. I personally saw white-haired old men and women in their sixties and seventies and three-foot children gladly joining together to listen to lessons. We hope that this basic work will enable the elderly, the weak, children, and strong men to become strong collective organizations and participate in combat. In terms of developing the national economy, the prerequisite is to complete the internal lines of transportation. At present, the main highways traversing and running vertically through the province have been gradually renovated. This year, it is planned to continue to build three lines, including the line, and implement joint transportation with neighboring provinces to facilitate the transportation of the province's special products and develop inter-provincial trade. We will do our best to develop export trade and implement active trade. In terms of finance, we will abandon the policy of increasing taxes and heavy taxes, and only intend to reorganize the existing taxes. Other measures, such as completing land administration surveys and water conservancy surveys, and then increasing the opening of cultivated land and developing water conservancy and water transportation, will also be carried out simultaneously. Recently, new tasks have also been determined:

(1) Improving the people's livelihood, not focusing on cities and the upper class, but focusing on the universal improvement of the people at the grassroots level, and focusing on improving the lives of the vast number of farmers and workers. The detailed plans will be announced soon.

(2) Establishing research institutes to enable specialized talents in various departments to continue their academic and technical research and increase their knowledge, in line with practical needs.

(3) Promoting national physical education. Seeing that people are physically weak, we should expand national physical education this year. We plan to first set up a physical education class to train new talents and send them to work in various counties.

(4) Establishing a publishing house specifically to compile and print wartime reading materials, with the aim of strengthening the will to resist the war, and focusing on the translation of foreign languages to improve knowledge and cultural standards.

These are all work goals that must be achieved this year. Chen concluded by discussing the war situation, saying, "In recent months, we have encountered the most dangerous storms in the process of the War of Resistance. However, with the great leadership of the leaders and the government and the strong national will to fight, we have now seen the light. This time next year, we will be able to celebrate a great victory and success together."

It is speculated that Ishiwatari will also restrict company dividends, implement a partial control system and supervision of national industry, and promote foreign trade and encourage production and sales cooperation.

### A Record of the Bloody Battle on the Nanxun Line in April (Part 1)

— Zhuang Ju

[Special Dispatch from Nanchang by Our Newspaper] Since the War of Resistance, the greatest annihilation suffered by the Japanese likely occurred in the battle on the Nanxun Line. This is an indelible contribution of our soldiers, and also a glorious and important page in the history of the War of Resistance. From Jiujiang to De'an, the entire line is only a hundred *li*, but under the combined fierce attack of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, our heroic soldiers were able to hold out for four whole months (from July to October), eliminating over 100,000 Japanese soldiers and capturing countless others. This must be regarded as a great success in annihilation warfare, and we cannot but admire the command and strategy of the officers on the front line. We must never forget the De'an battle, which followed the great victory at Taierzhuang!

Originally, the Japanese ambition was to seize Jiujiang as a base, then launch a large-scale southward offensive, occupy Nanchang, and directly attack Pingxiang and Liling, Jin Hua, thus threatening the political, economic, and cultural centers of the second phase of the War of Resistance in Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang provinces. Therefore, from July 5th, the Japanese began to invade us, but our army resisted at every step in a bloody battle that lasted four months. The Japanese paid a tremendous price, and only managed to occupy a few small cities on the Nanxun Line. Especially after our army withdrew from De'an on October 30th, the Japanese, due to heavy casualties, were clearly unable to attack further. Thus, for the past two months, they have been repairing both the northern and southern banks of the Henan River, and the war has fallen into a stalemate. However, recently our army has completed its deployment and is preparing to launch a large-scale counter-offensive against the Japanese. It is predicted that at the beginning of the new year, when everything is renewed, good news will be frequently reported from the Jiujiang River. This reporter has followed the army for several months, specifically collecting historical materials from this campaign to provide a systematic report to the readers:

The Battle of Jiujiang Enters a Favorable Phase

Jiujiang is located in northern Jiangxi, in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and is a strategically vital location. After the Japanese occupied Madang and Hukou one after another in June, they took advantage of the situation to launch a comprehensive offensive against Jiujiang using the combined power of their army, navy, and air force, intending to use it as a base to advance west along the Yangtze River, west along the Jiuling Highway, and south along the Nanxun Railway.

However, while Jiujiang is very important strategically, its terrain and the equipment of our army made it a difficult area to defend. It is a triangular zone, with its northeast sides bordered by the river and lake, allowing the Japanese to land anywhere. Moreover, we had no fortifications, and the blockade line in the river was only a little over ten *li* deep. The entire battlefield was controlled by Japanese naval guns, and the maneuver area was too small, making troop deployment extremely difficult. Therefore, after exacting a considerable price, our army had no choice but to abandon Jiujiang.

The Japanese began their attack on Jiujiang on July 5th, dispatching warships to the northern and southern waterways, the mouth of Poyang Lake, and other places to clear mines and destroy our blockade line. After mid-July, they gradually increased the use of aircraft for reconnaissance and bombing. In fact, the Japanese mine-sweeping was repeatedly repelled by us during the day, and they suffered considerable casualties. It was only because we lacked river defense equipment that they were able to attack at night. On the night of the 23rd, the situation suddenly became tense. A large number of Japanese troops gathered on the west bank of Poyang Lake, using over a hundred motorboats to transport thousands of Japanese soldiers, who forcibly landed at Yin Jia Hu north of Gu Tang. Our troops defending that area immediately launched a fierce counterattack. The battle continued until Japanese aircraft came to cooperate in the operation, and Japanese warships provided covering fire, breaking through our positions. However, that night General Li Hanhun led his troops in a night attack and recaptured the line of Ta Ding Shan and Pu Shan, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. On the 24th and 25th, the Japanese dispersed and infiltrated areas such as Ya Que Shan, Ba Li Po, and south of Liao Jia Ban. At the same time, Japanese aircraft and warships fiercely bombarded Jiujiang city, causing fires to break out in the city, and disrupting order. Japanese motorboats landed at the Yang You Chang and Ma Chang Hu. Due to strategic considerations, our army was ordered that night to retreat to Maling, and built strong defensive lines in Niu Tou Shan, Jin Guan Qiao, Shi Li Shan, and Gu Ling Shan. From then on, our army moved to a new and favorable position.

Repeated Changes in Strategy, the Japanese Still Fail

Maling is characterized by undulating hills and narrow valleys in the north and south. In 1926, General Zhang Fakui led the Iron Army generals, including Miao Peinan, Wu Qiwu, and Li Hanhun, to defeat Sun Chuanfang here. Now, General Li Hanhun has returned, so he is naturally experienced. The main defensive area extends from Niu Tou Shan on the west side of Mount Lu, diagonally southwest, turns northwest through Jin Jia Shan, crosses the Deng Jia River to the west of Shi Li Shan. The terrain is extremely favorable to us. First, away from the rivers and lakes, the Japanese naval artillery loses its effectiveness. Second, destroying the roads prevents the Japanese tanks and heavy artillery from operating. Third, surrounded by large mountains and dense forests, Japanese aircraft cannot find bombing targets. In addition, new fortifications have been built, forming an iron-like defensive line. On this circular position, General Li Hanhun defended for a whole month, eliminating over 20,000 Japanese soldiers and expending over 20 million yuan worth of Japanese ammunition, firearms, and other materials. This is the greatest achievement in offensive and defensive warfare since our War of Resistance.

In early August, the Japanese used the 106th Division, the 90th Division, and part of the 20th Division and 101st Division, totaling about 80,000 troops formed of "Manchukuo" security forces from Anhui, with the commander of the 106th Division, Matsuura, as the commander-in-chief, supported by Japanese air power, to launch a fierce offensive against us. From the 2nd to the 5th, they repeatedly pressed our two flanks. The positions of Wang Da Nao, Niu Tou Shan, and Lao Hu Shan on the right flank, and Xiao Jia Dun, Da Tian Shan, Shi Li Shan, and Ma Tou Shan on the left flank, were repeatedly contested with the Japanese. Statistics show that the Japanese suffered over 2,000 casualties, and we captured a lieutenant and seized a large amount of ammunition worth over 100,000 yuan. The Japanese, angered by the heavy casualties on our two flanks, shamefully fired hundreds of gas shells at our positions on the river islands on the 5th. Our army suffered heavy casualties. After the 6th, they continuously used dense artillery fire as cover, and infantry reapplied the old trick of breaking through the center, advancing towards Jin Guan Qiao; at the same time, they divided their troops and repeatedly attacked the heights of Da Tian Shan and Chen Jia Dun on the left flank. After a fierce battle, the position was lost and regained several times. Our division, led by Chen Gongxia, bravely charged towards the Japanese, completely destroying the Japanese plan to break through the center. However, our regimental commander, Zhang Zeshen, was unfortunately wounded in this battle. By the 26th, Japanese reinforcements had steadily arrived, replenishments were almost complete, and they again used aircraft and artillery to cover their infantry in a fierce offensive against our entire line. The casualties on both sides amounted to several thousand; however, because our left wing was breached by the Japanese, the Japanese were able to advance along the Puzong Highway to Shan, outflanking our army. On September 2nd, their vanguard advanced to He Shang Miao and Huai Shu Yi. At this time, our army was in a position to be surrounded by the Japanese on all sides, so we calmly retreated to the vicinity of De'an.
