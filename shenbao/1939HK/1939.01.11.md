### British Prime Minister's Visit to Rome

British Prime Minister Chamberlain's visit to Rome with Foreign Secretary Halifax was decided as early as the Munich Agreement in late September of last year. Given Mr. Chamberlain's advanced age of seventy, his willingness to travel tirelessly for the sake of peace is truly admirable. However, attempting to clarify the world situation through compromise with aggressor nations may, in fact, prove counterproductive. It is reminiscent of the time when Chamberlain earned the reputation of a "peace envoy" during the resolution of the Czech-German dispute, but in reality, the crisis in Europe remained latent, and the so-called peace was merely a temporary state of uneasy calm! Nevertheless, this does not dampen the courage of this "peace envoy," so this trip to Rome is definitely not a mere formality. The significance of his intentions is evident, and the following points are worthy of attention:

1.  Adjustment of British-Italian relations. Since the Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935, British support for the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy has led to a deterioration in relations. Italy, facing financial difficulties, especially after annexing Abyssinia, needed funds both due to the excessive wartime consumption and the desire to develop the conquered territories. Aside from borrowing from Britain, there was no better solution. Therefore, although Mussolini habitually used intimidating and blackmailing tactics, he always maintained a policy of appeasing Britain and suppressing France, because only in this way could he salvage his financially desperate crisis. In recent years, however, Mussolini has been determined to gain control of the Mediterranean, thereby controlling the British and French routes to the East, particularly the British communication lines with India and Australia. This ambition has caused Britain constant unease. During the Munich Conference, Chamberlain could generously sacrifice Czechoslovakia, whereas in 1935, he strongly opposed Italy's invasion of Abyssinia. The reason lies herein. Furthermore, Britain possesses vast colonies in Africa, with a large portion of its East African territories bordering Abyssinia. Once Italy's power in Abyssinia is stabilized, Britain's colonies could be invaded at any time because Mussolini's main policy is to restore the glory of the ancient Roman Empire, and his ideology is based on war and aggression. Chamberlain's trip to Rome this time is to probe Mussolini's true intentions, then seek to adjust British-Italian relations, and engage in negotiations on the Mediterranean issue and the British-Italian African territorial boundaries.

2.  Franco-Italian problems. After the resolution of the German-Czech dispute, Mussolini believed that the diplomatic policy adopted by the British and French authorities today is to avoid trouble and maintain peace, even at the cost of any compromise or sacrifice, to clarify the European situation. Furthermore, after the Munich Agreement, France lost the support of its allies, and the Franco-Soviet Pact became a mere formality, leaving its international standing isolated. This led to the demands for territory from France in the Italian Parliament on November 30, and the unilateral declaration of the annulment of the Rome Agreement signed in January 1935 in late December of last year. The relationship between France and Italy has been fluctuating tightly in the past two months. As it stands, Italy certainly lacks the capacity for foreign warfare, but since fascist countries take aggression as their sole national policy, as does Germany, as does Japan, why should Italy be an exception? In the end, if their goals cannot be achieved, they might take a great risk and resort to force to achieve their aims. On the French side, public sentiment is fierce, and French Prime Minister Daladier has repeatedly stated that France is willing to compromise with all countries for the sake of peace, but it would be a major error to mistake this for weakness in French policy. On the 6th of this month, in his speech at the reception of the Governor-General of Algeria, he stated: France's determination to protect its territories remains unchanged. … The French territory extends from the Flanders Plain to the banks of the Congo River, and its influence extends to Asia. If necessary, France will not hesitate to go to war to safeguard freedom and the freedom of all nations. Anyone who seeks to undermine the integrity of France will meet with our strong resistance. From this, we can see that France will not concede to Italy's territorial demands. If the current crisis between France and Italy cannot be resolved, the appeasement of the European situation cannot be achieved. This time, Chamberlain does not hesitate to undertake the long journey, and Italy welcomes him warmly, precisely to use him as a mediator to achieve his insatiable ambition. Although France has expressed its unwillingness for British interference in mediating the Franco-Italian conflict, it is undoubtedly one of the main tasks of Chamberlain's visit to Italy. We can see that Chamberlain first went to Paris to meet with Daladier en route to Rome, which shows that his intention was to test the attitude of the French government in preparation for mediation.

3.  Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. The fact that the Spanish Civil War has been prolonged for more than two years is due to the support of the rebel forces by Italy and Germany. In particular, Italy wants to gain a base within Spanish territory to threaten France, and at the same time, increase its power to control the Mediterranean. Therefore, overthrowing the Spanish Republican government is a major conspiracy. During the Munich Conference, Chamberlain and Mussolini reached an understanding on the withdrawal of Spanish volunteers. However, Italy did not fulfill its promise afterward. Although several thousand volunteers were withdrawn from Spain at that time, in reality, these volunteers were injured and disabled, and had lost their combat capabilities. According to reports from Paris in late last month, Mussolini instigated the Spanish rebel army to launch a general offensive on December 15, and the Italian Air Force assisted in the battle, so as to create a "fait accompli in Spain" on the day Chamberlain arrived in Rome. From this, it can be seen that the resolution of the Spanish issue may encounter great difficulties.

If the above three points cannot be resolved, the new Four-Power Conference will not be possible. From our observations, Chamberlain's dedication to peace is admirable, but his tendency to accommodate totalitarian countries in everything may only increase the threat to peace. The result of the Munich Agreement accelerated Hitler's aggressive ambitions in Eastern Europe. In Southern Europe, there is Mussolini's coveting of French territory. In the East, it triggered the Japanese militarists' attack on South China, posing a serious threat to Hong Kong. Rooting out the source and clarifying the situation is the only good way to establish peace. This point, I believe, has already been noted by the wise rulers of Britain!

### Our West River Forces Advance Towards Sanshui, Initial Counter-Offensive Concluded, All Routes Set to Converge on Guangzhou

【Zhao Qing Urgent Dispatch】Fourth War Zone Commander Zhang Fakui, determined to recover Guangzhou in a short period, dispatched telegrams to the east, west, and north routes simultaneously. The military situation has taken a sharp turn for the better, progressing smoothly. According to a certain official here, our counter-offensive forces towards Guangzhou, after the recovery of Dongguan, Taiping, Shilong in the east, Sanshui, Foshan in the west, and Conghua, Huaxian in the north, will converge from all routes for a general assault on Guangzhou. Overall, the fighting on all routes in recent days indicates that our initial counter-offensive has concluded. As we enter the end of the year and the beginning of the new year, our counter-offensive military operations will see greater progress. The recovery of Guangzhou is only a matter of time. The future of the Guangdong war is extremely optimistic. The following is a record of the situation on the West River:

Defensive Line Established on the West River

Since the successive reinforcements of troops to Sanshui, Southwest, Jiujiang, and other places, they have been restless and plotting to invade the West River. West River Headquarters Director Xu Jingtang reorganized the military defense of the West River, designating Gaoyao, Sihui, Gaoming, and Heshan counties as the first line of defense, garrisoned by the Guangdong and Guangxi armies. Deqing, Yunfu, Yunan, Fengchuan, Luoding, and Guangning counties were designated as the second line of defense, defended by a certain unit and local self-defense teams. Therefore, our defenses on the West River are not only strong enough to resist the invasion but also well-equipped for a counter-offensive at any time. Director Xu Jingtang issued an order to attack the enemy forces in Sanshui. Our troops on the Gaoyao and Sihui front lines are advancing steadily towards the enemy forces in Sanshui.

County Teams Confer on Joint Defense

After the completion of our West River defense arrangements, Deputy Commander Chen Dousu of the 19th Guerrilla District and Commander Ma Yi of the 2nd Guerrilla District convened a joint defense meeting yesterday at a certain location to discuss joint defense and eradication of traitors. Attendees included Liang Naisen of Gaoyao, Tan Ruichu of Gaoming, Mai Xingfu of Heshan, Ye Jichang of Xinxing, Liu Zicai of Yunan, Peng Songru of Luoding, Chen Youshan of Yunfu, Li Jiong of Deqing, Li Zipei of Guangning, Liang Haiqi of Fengchuan, Wu Binghua of Kaijian, and Li Zhongren of Sihui, among others. During the meeting, various measures were discussed and decided upon regarding joint defense, eradication of traitors, and establishing regulations. It was also decided to requisition civilian firearms, expand guerrilla units, and strengthen self-defense forces. Regarding the replenishment of ammunition, the Self-Defense Corps Management Office of the Fourth War Zone was requested to provide as much as possible. At the same time, it was stipulated that the junctions of Gaoming and Heshan should be jointly defended by elite troops drawn from the county teams and regular forces. The upper reaches of the West River will be strictly consolidated by the county teams in conjunction with a certain unit of the Guangxi army. Currently, the county teams are implementing the plans agreed upon at the meeting.

Enemy Attempts to Plunder Grain

According to reports, the invading enemy forces in Guangdong are facing extreme difficulties in the supply of grain and supplies. The enemy forces stationed in Guangzhou, Nanhai, Huaxian, and Sanshui are lacking food and clothing. Therefore, they have repeatedly sent troops to plunder grain and clothing. The enemy forces in Jiujiang, Lianglong, and Sanshui are in particular need of grain. Before their fall, Jiujiang and Lianglong were already facing a grain shortage. After their fall, the remaining grain was looted by the enemy. The people fled to other places, and the fields were barren. Therefore, the enemy is recently attempting to attack Gaoming, Gulao, and Sanzhou to plunder food. However, the enemy lacks the combat capability to invade Guangxi. Deputy Commander Deng Yanhua of the First Guerrilla District has ordered the guerrilla teams of Nanhai, Shunde, and Sanshui to intercept the enemy forces at any time in the rear of the enemy forces in Nanhai, Panyu, and Shunde. Commander Wu Guanhong of the Second Guerrilla District has ordered the guerrilla teams of Panyu and Huaxian to cut off their food supplies, so that they may collapse and be annihilated soon.

### The Korean Volunteer Corps in China

— Yu

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing] Since the War of Resistance, the enthusiastic sympathy and practical assistance of international people have become a great force in the determination of the Chinese people. From the perspective of international friends coming to China to participate in the battlefield, the facts are even more obvious. The Korean people, because of the cruel treatment they have suffered at the hands of the Japanese, have a particularly deep and sensitive understanding of the Japanese. Therefore, their sympathy and assistance to our War of Resistance are also particularly enthusiastic. The Korean Volunteer Corps, which grew up during the War of Resistance, has indelible merits on its merit list. At the current stage of the War of Resistance entering its second phase, launching a large-scale guerrilla war behind the enemy lines is our main military strategy in the future. The Korean Volunteer Corps is responsible for a part of the implementation of this strategy. The reporter specially went to visit Mr. Yang Minshan of the Propaganda Department of the Korean National Revolutionary Party to ask him about the latest situation of the Volunteer Corps. He said:

"The Korean Volunteer Corps belongs to the Korean National Revolutionary Party. It was established on the tenth section of last year. The person fully responsible for the team is Mr. Kim Ruoshan, the general secretary of the Korean National Revolutionary Party."

Then, he talked about the organization and work of the team, "Most of those who join the Volunteer Corps are members of the Korean National Revolutionary Party, and those who are responsible for leading various parts are mostly Korean people who have a revolutionary history or participated in the Northern Expedition of China in 1926, or have studied in China and received military training, and participated in the Chinese revolution, or have led student movements in their own country and have done many glorious things. Therefore, the leadership is relatively sound."

"They have not yet directly fought the Japanese. Their current task is divided into two parts, one for the country and one for foreign countries. For their own country, they are calling on and persuading the entire Korean nation to support and assist China's War of Resistance and strive for their own freedom and independence in China's War of Resistance. For China, they are promoting it to the Chinese people in various war zones and telling the Chinese people all the pain of being a slave of a fallen country. They tell the Chinese people the true face of the weak nations under the rule of Japanese imperialism.

Give the Chinese people the courage to resist. Judging from their experience of more than a year, the effect they have achieved is greater than that of other war zone service groups in terms of publicity."

"Secondly, they instigate Japanese soldiers to oppose the war. Because of their convenience in language, they do this work very well."

He listed several facts about how Japanese soldiers' opposition to the war was the result of the instigation of the Korean Volunteer Corps. Then, he said again, "In the past year or so, China has been fighting on the front. Therefore, they have not fulfilled the task of the Volunteer Corps. In the future, with the transformation of China's strategy, they will display the spirit of the Righteous Army Movement in the Ito Hirobumi era to fight to the death with the Japanese, because China's War of Resistance is not only seeking the liberation of the Chinese nation but also seeking freedom for the Korean compatriots."

"Where are the family members of the Korean Volunteer Corps members now?" The reporter was deeply afraid that the vicious claws of the Japanese would search for their innocent wives and children.

He replied: "They are all here."

"Then what do they rely on for their livelihood?"

"Currently, it is maintained by the Korean National Revolutionary Party, but this is not a long-term solution. We are planning to open up production enterprises and hope that Chinese industrialists and entrepreneurs will come out to help us!"

### Passing Through the × District

— Pale Red

【Battlefield Sketches】Comrades accustomed to working in the rear often feel a vague sense of apprehension at the mention of "× District," as if it were a place one should not venture to easily, fearing unforeseen dangers at every turn. However, our journey from × County in southeastern Shanxi to Hekou near Taiyuan... passing through the × District, and reaching Hekou, the stronghold of our anti-Japanese guerrillas, has deepened our understanding of the war of resistance through our observations along the river.

The populace's understanding of the war of resistance has deepened, and they regard warfare as commonplace. Taking Yonghe, Daning, and Yangxian as examples, most of these cities have been burned by the Japanese ×, but strangely, the general public does not consider it a big deal, and cheerfully lives their lives during the war. When the × people arrive, they quickly lead their parents, wives, and children into hiding. Once the × people leave, the common people quickly move back, continuing their ordinary lives. Even though the × people have burned down shops and houses, merchants naturally set out their goods on the remaining steps. The old folks still lead their oxen to plow the fields. In the × District, we, fully armed, passed through. From morning till night, we scarcely saw any × people.

Two or three miles past Qingyuan Gaobai Town, the winding Tai-Fen Highway stretched before us, a major road used by the × people from Taiyuan to Fenyang. Due to its military transportation importance and to prevent sabotage by our guerrillas, the Japanese × constantly dispatched heavily armed patrols. Thus, the general populace felt that the Tai-Fen Highway was difficult to cross. Over a hundred of our armed comrades calmly approached the highway, filled with excitement, all ammunition at the ready, eager to fight to the death against the × people. Suddenly, the × people's tanks came speeding over, but the × soldiers, seeing our well-ordered ranks ready for battle, fearing that we would attack them, hastily reversed their armored vehicles.

On another occasion, as we were about to cross the Ping-Fen branch line, we had just reached the vicinity of a village. It was late at night, and the commotion of men and horses caused the village dogs to bark. The × people were no more than half a mile away, and they simultaneously detected us, their searchlights intensely scanning us. At that moment, our faces and clothes were as bright as if illuminated by moonlight, but the × people, fearing our attack, eventually fled far away.

The × people drive cars, tanks, and armored vehicles to transport supplies and ammunition, forcing them to travel the Tai-Fen Highway. Both sides of the road are completely covered with towering mountains. When the × people pass through here, if our troops lie in ambush on the mountaintops or in the green cornfields, they can inflict considerable losses on the × people. Therefore, our worker-armed self-defense forces often lie in wait on both sides of the highway to attack the × people. As a result, the × people's cars were burned, and their wool coats, leather shoes, warhorses, supplies, canned goods, etc., became our spoils of war.

In the × District, the orders and official documents of the puppet government were numerous, but when the orders reached the various villages, the village chiefs and heads of the townships ignored them. Although shameless elements such as the × people's traitors and lackeys exerted every effort to urge and intimidate by various means, they only managed to go through the motions. In reality, none of the measures implemented by the puppet organization were ever fully carried out. On the other hand, the enthusiasm and support of the people along the way for us fully demonstrated their hatred and animosity towards the × people and their love for the motherland. Wherever we passed, men, women, old and young, gathered along the streets to watch us, without the slightest fear. They busily boiled water, cooked food, and bought things for us, and even shared all the fruits, dates, and other snacks they had at home with us, hoping that we would eat them all up. But if the × people arrived today, the common people would all flee, taking all their food and supplies with them.

Near the cities occupied by the × people, although still under the leadership of our government, they inevitably suffer from the harassment and plunder of the × people. Therefore, the villagers in these places are constantly hoping for the arrival and protection of our guerrillas. If they encountered the arrival or passage of our army, the people would automatically act as sentries for our troops. If they spotted the arrival of the × people outside the village, they would quickly return to the village to report, instructing us on how to escape, avoiding unnecessary conflicts with the × people to prevent unexpected losses. In addition, when our guerrillas infiltrated the areas already occupied by the × people for reconnaissance or propaganda, there was no danger of being discovered by the × people, even if we were in the same village as the × people. Even if the × people lived in a house on the east side, we would live in the courtyard on the west side. Apart from the common people, neither the × people nor us knew of each other's presence. The cooperation between the military and the people has reached this point.

Having walked through six or seven county towns along the way, a gratifying phenomenon often excited and encouraged us. We saw the people's hatred for the ×× people expressed all over the streets and walls, and sometimes they would directly point out the crimes of the ×× people in various places. This was so exciting!

We firmly believe that the people groaning and writhing in the × District are the main part of our anti-× ranks. We must not overlook their anti-× activism, and we must not let go of the civil affairs work in the × District. Only by strengthening the work to win over the people in the × District can we expose all the conspiracies of the × people and achieve the initial victory of our guerrilla strategy.

### Our Army's Counteroffensive in Northern Hunan Achieves Success, River Defense in Western Shanxi Becomes Increasingly Stable, Second Phase of Supplementary Troops in Guangdong Set to Depart, People's Armed Forces in Shandong Reach 200,000

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing by Our Newspaper, 11th] Military news: The various battlefields remain quiet, with no major battles. The new cabinet has been reorganized and seems to be still considering new battle strategies. Therefore, most places are adopting a defensive posture. Our counteroffensives in Hunan and Shanxi are making good progress. Although Guangzhou is difficult to take immediately, the counties are definitely within our encirclement. The river defense in western Shanxi is becoming more secure. The enemy is repeatedly increasing troops in Shanxi and Suiyuan. The Northwest will become the center of major battles. The reorganization of our guerrilla forces in Hebei and Chahar will soon be completed, and their strength will be enhanced. The war situation in Shandong has recently become quiet. The organized people's armed forces in that province have reached 200,000.

[Special Dispatch from Kunming by Our Newspaper, 9th] The second phase of anti-Japanese supplementary troops in Yunnan is about to depart. Provincial Chairman Long Yun made a special trip to the concentration point yesterday to give a speech, encouraging their ambition to kill the enemy. He returned to the province on the evening of the 9th.

[Cable from Fancheng by Central News Agency, 9th] (1) There are more than 300 enemy troops and dozens of horses at Cangzibu in Huanggang. (2) There are also more than 200 enemy troops at Dujiapu and Qilongzhen in Songbu.

[Dispatch from Chongqing by Associated Press, 10th] Chinese military authorities say that China has been deployed in all war zones to prepare for the attack by the Japanese fascist Prime Minister Hiranuma's cabinet. In addition, China has set up two additional war zones in the interior, changed guerrilla tactics, and set up five major areas for troop concentration from Inner Mongolia to the border of Annam. In short, all military equipment has been enhanced to repel Hiranuma's attack.

[Special Dispatch from Zhongshan by Our Newspaper, 11th] According to indirect front-line news from here, our artillery team and garrison on the south bank of the West River, Jinli, have repelled the invading enemy forces from Makou on the Pearl River Delta. On the 8th of this month, under the fierce artillery fire and dense machine gun fire of our side, the enemy troops suffered heavy casualties and significant losses. The enemy's offensive this time did not change its usual style of operation, first bombarding our positions with artillery fire, and then attempting to land. All the enemy's landing attempts failed because our front was equipped with machine guns and small steel cannon positions. The enemy commander then ordered 36 bombers to bomb our positions, dropping 100 bombs on Jinli Town, destroying many walls and civilian houses. However, our army suffered very few casualties. Also, the enemy navy attempted to land at Yulin Port on Hainan Island on the 7th, but was immediately fired upon by our garrison stationed on the island, and the enemy troops retreated without achieving their landing goal. It is speculated that the enemy's move was to test the strength of our defense forces. In addition, the enemy troops in Shilong and Humen have now been reinforced by new troops from Taiwan. The purpose of this is currently unknown.

[Cable from Guilin by Central News Agency, 10th] Recently, our troops have been constantly attacking the enemy in Yangmei and Sanjiang. The enemy was in a state of panic and collapse, retreating towards the Sanshui position.

[News from Hong Kong] The Taikoo ship Sichuan arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Haikou, carrying mostly tea. According to visitors from Haikou, the sea off Haikou was recently gathered by the enemy and the situation was quite tense, but by the 5th and 6th of this month, they had left one after another. On that day, an enemy aircraft carrier passed by the sea outside Haikou and sailed northeast, its whereabouts unknown. Enemy planes often fly over Haikou recently for reconnaissance, but the flight altitude is very high and barely visible. The citizens think that this move by the enemy planes is a common occurrence, so they are not panicked. The situation in Beihai is very stable, and shops have resumed business as usual. Goods from Hong Kong and Beihai are coming and going as usual.

[Dispatch from Shanghai by Shanghai News Agency, 11th] It was learned from the Japanese side that from August to December, Japanese troops in the Shanghai-Nanjing area were attacked by guerrillas at least 309 times.

[Cable from Xingji by Mingeshe, 11th] In the counteroffensive against Jixian, our army occupied Liujiashan (5 miles south of the city) in the morning and fiercely bombarded the enemy inside the city. The allied forces are also approaching the mountains on the outskirts of the city. The enemy in the city is very panicked and is expected to recover the county within days. The enemy in Puxian has been pressured by our army and it is difficult to hold on for a long time. They are now conducting large-scale looting within the city and appear to be abandoning the city.

[Cable from Xiangjiang by Central News Agency, 9th] The Hunan-Jiangxi border area is peaceful. Because the enemy is afraid of our guerrillas, they patrol the circular highway from Yueyang Wujiapai to Taolin with dozens of tanks every day to show their strength. Currently, Taolin and its southwest area are garrisoned by the Yamakita Detachment of the Tagata Regiment, including the troops of Nakamurayama, totaling more than 1,000. Yueyang and its suburbs are garrisoned by the infantry, cavalry, and artillery of the Nishimura Regiment, totaling about 2,000 people.

Our Air Force Attacks Wuhan

[Cable from Chongqing by Central News Agency, 10th] News from outside Hankou: Clear artillery fire occurred in the Wuchang area yesterday morning, especially intense between 8:00 and 9:00. At the same time, six Japanese planes patrolled the sky. According to news from the Chinese side, Chinese planes attacked Wuhan yesterday, but the Japanese side strongly denied this. Also, there were intense explosions in Wuchang yesterday afternoon.

[Cable from Chongqing by Central News Agency, 11th] News from Hankou: The commander of the Japanese Gendarmerie in Hankou recently told foreign reporters that the population of Hankou was 1.3 million before the Japanese occupation, and now it is only about 400,000, an increase of about 10,000 in the past two months. When reporters asked why robberies occur in Hankou from time to time, and whether the Japanese side can find a way to protect them, he replied that any large city inevitably has robberies, even in Osaka, robberies cannot be avoided.

### Overseas Associations Request the Formation of Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army, Representatives Have Been Sent Back to China for Contact

[News from Hong Kong] During this war of resistance, the overseas Chinese have been the most supportive of the central government, and the overseas Chinese merchants in various places have contributed the most money and manpower, all advocating fighting to the last person and the last soldier, and refusing to negotiate or surrender. Therefore, an increasing number of overseas Chinese youths from Nanyang have returned to China to serve, and many young people from far away have died on the battlefield. The sincerity and understanding of the overseas Chinese towards the motherland are admirable. It is a pity that the military authorities have never paid attention to finding ways to organize these children of overseas Chinese into an army, so that the overseas Chinese have no way to volunteer. Recently, overseas Chinese associations in various ports in Nanyang, such as the Saigon Overseas Chinese Yu Ren Society, the 7th Branch of the Vietnamese Xidi, the Australian Industrial Promotion Society, the Dutch East Indies Joint Association, the Burmese Overseas Chinese Frugality and National Salvation Association, and the European and American overseas Chinese organizations, all believe that it is necessary for overseas Chinese to apply to form an army. It is said that they have now initiated and sent representatives to visit a certain famous general who was formerly stationed at the Songhu Fortress (currently serving as the Guerrilla Commander of the West River XX District), requesting him to be responsible for planning and organizing the "Overseas Chinese Volunteer Army" or "Overseas Chinese Guerrilla Force" under the command of the commander. On the one hand, they are earnestly requesting the central military authorities to accept it. If the government permits it in the future and a certain army agrees, they will proceed to call on all overseas Chinese communities to return to China to eliminate the enemy. According to the leaders of overseas Chinese associations in various places, if the overseas Chinese army is trained by a certain anti-Japanese hero, they do not have to worry about funding, and even the issue of military equipment is easy to solve. They sincerely hope that the military authorities will pay attention to this.

### Xu Shiying Arrives in Chongqing to Report to the Central Government, Xu Expresses Deep Gratitude for the Assistance of the Hong Kong Government and Overseas Chinese

### The Collapse of the Konoe Cabinet and the Prospects for the Hiranuma Cabinet (Continued from Page 7 Yesterday)

— Li Wanjui

No change in the strategy towards China - the lesson of eight months of war has not awakened the Japanese warlords' dream of a "quick victory." From the first phase to the third phase, it always adopted a large-scale encirclement strategy, hoping to eliminate the main force of our army. Otherwise, the war would not end and the attempt to conquer China would not be realized. If the war is prolonged by one day, the difficulties will inevitably increase, the mire will become deeper and deeper, and the arrival of collapse will be faster. Therefore, the Japanese military action after the formation of the Hiranuma cabinet will inevitably be more tense, fierce, and cruel, which we must pay attention to. However, at the same time, the military will intensify its invasion, and the work of compromising and buying off those who are unclear about the situation and have wavering will will not stop. Because without peace talks, they cannot obtain the desired war results, and they cannot save the domestic crisis that is already erupting. We must thoroughly recognize why the Japanese warlords are keen on peace talks? Because their paper tiger can no longer scare people and has been exposed. Therefore, we must endure hardships and never be fooled by it, so that future generations will suffer endless pain.

Hiranuma is a former judicial official with a narrow perspective. What he can accomplish is already predictable. According to our speculation, what he wants to promote is only the above-mentioned four major points. However, the difficulties currently encountered by Japan in internal and foreign affairs cannot be overcome by a great politician with the ability to turn the tide. The difficulties that the new cabinet cannot overcome are as follows:

(1) The scale of the war is expanding, and the front line is extended, which will inevitably increase the number of troops and military expenses. Judging from the current situation in Japan, the financial resources are exhausted, and the strength is almost exhausted to the point where no troops can be transferred. (2) International pressure is increasing day by day, and internal reform is difficult to achieve. The business index has declined since August last year. As the war is prolonged, the contraction will inevitably become more harmful. (3) The poverty of the Japanese people is caused by the aggressive war, not by the oppression of foreign countries. Therefore, what the Japanese public demands is a truce and internal reform. (4) The fascist regime is only darkness, not light, in the eyes of most of the Japanese impoverished class, and will cause international contempt and disgust, such as the United States and the Soviet Union, which will easily lead to the outbreak of internal revolution.

In short, since the Hiranuma cabinet is so weak and wants to solve the many problems facing Japan, we can conclude that it will inevitably face difficulties at every step and fall into a helpless situation. Therefore, it may be reorganized soon, but reorganization may not be able to increase its strength, may not be able to extend its fate, and may not be able to avoid the collapse of Japanese politics. - (The End)

### Yunnan During the Second Phase of the War of Resistance

[Special dispatch from Kunming] The War of Resistance has entered its second phase, and Yunnan has become a transportation hub for sustained resistance. The Burma Road has replaced the Guangdong-Hankou Railway for national transportation. The construction of the two major railways in western Yunnan—the Yunnan-Burma Railway and the Sichuan-Kunming Railway—commenced with groundbreaking ceremonies on February 25th of last year, and is expected to be completed by the end of March of this year for surveying and alignment work. Yunnan province has grown from the War of Resistance. The preparations made by Yunnan province for the second phase of the War of Resistance are listed as follows.

Replenishment of Military Personnel

The provincial authorities, in order to replenish the military personnel for the War of Resistance, convened a conference and established a Regiment Training Office to coordinate the training of conscripts. Conscription and training sub-offices were set up in several counties to conduct inspections and training nearby. In preparation for participating in the second phase of the War of Resistance, Chairman Long ordered the Regiment Training Office to conscript 8,000 strong young men to concentrate in a certain location, to be inspected and accepted by Division Commander An, with a deadline for departure. As soon as the order was issued, volunteers eagerly registered. The sources of these 8,000 strong young men are: 200 from Daguan County, 300 from Yanlü County, 300 from Chengxing County, 1,300 from Zhenxiong County, 600 from Yiliang County (belonging to the First Training Sub-Office); 900 from Guangnan County, 200 from Qiubei County, 150 from Yanshan County, 450 from Xichou County, 400 from Wenshan County (belonging to the Sixth Training Sub-Office); 450 from Mengzi County, 150 from Jianjiu County, 300 from Kaiyuan County, 550 from Jianshui County, 100 from Quxi County, 400 from Shiping County, 100 from Tonghai County; 100 from Exi County, 200 from Huaning County, 100 from Eshan County (belonging to the Second Training Sub-Office); 150 from Jiangchuan County (belonging to the Seventh Training Sub-Office). They are now concentrated for training. The 3,000 conscripts from Daguan and other counties under the jurisdiction of the First Sub-Office are organized into the First, Second, and Third Battalions. The 2,000 conscripts from Guangnan and other counties under the jurisdiction of the Sixth Sub-Office are organized into the Fourth and Fifth Battalions. The Mengzi... under the jurisdiction of the Second Sub-Office and Seventh Sub-Office are expected to be inspected and accepted by Commander An within the timeframe for departure.

Training of Cadres

In order to strengthen the various cadres and strictly organize party and government agencies, the province entrusted the military branch school to be responsible for training military, police, party, and government personnel, establishing a wartime cadre training corps. It is divided into four major units. The first unit is an officer training class, registered with the Zhongsuifu. It is composed of idle military officers from Yunnan and Guizhou provinces and a part of land survey personnel. The second unit is a sergeant training class for combat cadres. The Training Office selects cadres from its subordinate units and selects local high school students who have received military training. The third unit is a police officer training class. The fourth unit is a military training class for party and government administrative personnel. The duration of study for each unit varies, but the training principles are based on the principles of sustained warfare.

Rich Resources Waiting to be Developed

Since the Central Committee's Western Yunnan Border Inspection Group came to Yunnan from Chongqing and set out along the Dian-Myanmar Highway, their investigation showed that the natural conditions in the border areas are excellent. The mountains and rivers are beautiful, the climate is mild, and the agricultural output is fertile. Crops such as rice, cotton, tea, tobacco, and fruits can be grown on a large scale. Animal husbandry and sericulture are also easy to develop. Mineral deposits are abundant. Currently, the local people use rudimentary technology and minimal labor to obtain rewards and enjoyment that exceed the needs of farmers in the interior. This absolutely affluent area is still sparsely populated. In this time of refugee relief and resettlement, this place is truly a paradise in the southwest.

Many people believe that the obstacles in the western Yunnan border region are "miasma" and the "Baiyi" people. After the inspection group returned, they believed that the above two problems could be solved. The so-called "miasma" is said to be not as serious as rumored. As long as attention is paid to sanitation, the elimination of miasma is definitely not difficult. As for the so-called "Baiyi" people, their nature is docile and they are easy to educate. Even the mountain tribes known for their ferocity can be guided by the government and not only be a great help in development, but also be trained into brave soldiers for the War of Resistance. In addition, with the availability of the Yunnan-Burma Highway for transportation, with vigorous management, it can turn the miasma into a paradise. The province's "Border Economic Investigation Group" will set off to the southwestern counties after the Relief Committee's inspection team. Its organization is composed of provincial government economic advisors who will raise funds. The expected departure period is three months. The scope of work includes surveying rural economies and natural resources in the southwestern counties, researching methods to increase production, and plans for investing in industries. The results of the survey and research will be used as a basis for future policy recommendations and will be made public to all sectors of society for investment in industries.

In short, Yunnan province has grown up from the War of Resistance. In order to strengthen the "material resources" in the sustained war, the western Yunnan border area, or the western Yunnan's rich resources, must be developed quickly. (Wanshan, January 4th)

### British Prime Minister Departs for Italy: Met Daladier in Paris Last Night, British and French Foreign Ministers to Hold Talks: Chamberlain

[Reuters, London, 10th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain left here this morning for Rome. A large crowd gathered to see him off at Downing Street. Chamberlain received many congratulatory letters an hour before his departure. Hundreds of people gathered at Victoria Station to bid farewell to the British delegation to Rome. The delegation includes Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and their advisors and secretaries. They left here at 11:00. Chamberlain did not speak at the station. A group of unemployed people also gathered in another corner of the station, carrying a black coffin and a banner that read, "The unemployed need appeasement, not Mussolini." The protesters advanced to the platform as the special train departed, but were stopped by the police. French Ambassador Corbin and the Italian chargé d'affaires were at the station to bid farewell to Chamberlain. As the train departed, people lined up at the station and cheered loudly. Chamberlain smiled and waved in acknowledgement. However, the unemployed protesters mocked Chamberlain. The coffin they carried was destroyed near the platform.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 10th] According to French Foreign Ministry sources, the meeting between the British authorities and the French government leaders is entirely private. Chamberlain and Halifax will "have tea with Daladier and Bonnet" at the French Foreign Ministry. Chamberlain and others will arrive here at 6:00 p.m. and take a special express train to Rome at 7:30 p.m. The details of this meeting between the British and French authorities have already been discussed by French Foreign Minister Bonnet and the British Ambassador to France, Sir Eric Phipps.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 10th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet will travel to Geneva this Saturday to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting. However, according to well-informed sources, his purpose is to meet with British Foreign Secretary Halifax to discuss the results of the British-Italian talks in Rome.

[Haitong News Agency, Genoa, 10th] The central station here is currently being prepared for an official welcome. British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will arrive at the station at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. The Italian government's special welcoming delegation will arrive at this station tonight to prepare. The train carrying the British Prime Minister will stop at Genoa station for ten minutes before continuing to Rome, arriving in the Italian capital at approximately 4:30 p.m. tomorrow.

Respecting the Promise of Western Territory: British Prime Minister Will Urge Italy to Fulfill It

[Reuters, London, 10th] According to the Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the main purpose of the Rome meeting is not negotiation, but exploration. Chamberlain and Halifax are going to Italy without any fixed ideas or agenda, and have not received any key points that Mussolini wants to discuss. However, it is expected that the Spanish war and French-Italian relations will be the main topics of discussion. Regarding French-Italian relations, London and Paris believe that British mediation is out of the question, as the problem can only be solved by France and Italy themselves. However, the improvement of the atmosphere between the two countries will be welcomed by Britain. France has made it clear that this should not be misunderstood by Britain. London and Paris have fully understood this entire matter. Regarding the Spanish war, the British Prime Minister and others will state Britain's view that Italy's promise to respect the territorial and administrative integrity of Spain must be translated into action. Until the plan to withdraw foreign volunteers proposed by the Non-Intervention Committee is fully implemented, the granting of belligerent rights is out of the question. In addition to the above two issues, the refugee problem and economic problems will also be discussed. The content of the talks will largely depend on what Mussolini raises. The British Prime Minister does not want any firm stipulations. His main purpose in making this trip is not this. However, the visit of the British Prime Minister and others to Rome should allow them to assess the future trends and policies of the Italian axis in the coming months.

### Ambassador Guo Visits British Foreign Secretary: Urges the League of Nations to Take Action, US Decides to Adopt a Parallel Approach: Maintain Chinese Legal Tender, Oppose Japanese Destruction

[Reuters, London, 9th] Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Guo Taiqi, because Foreign Secretary Halifax will go to Geneva on his way back from Italy to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting, specifically visited the British Foreign Office this afternoon to urge him to pay attention to the severity of the Chinese situation, or to ask the League of Nations to take action.

[Reuters, London, 9th] According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, the British Cabinet has repeatedly discussed Japan's attitude towards China's open door policy. It has also been reported that London and Washington have fully and frankly exchanged views on the situation. Some observers here believe that London and Washington have reached the same conclusions from similar facts. Therefore, whatever steps are taken, the United Kingdom and the United States always maintain parallel measures. Although various rumors about maintaining Chinese legal tender have not yet been confirmed, maintaining Chinese legal tender is of great benefit to foreign businesses in China. Here, we strongly oppose the attempt to destroy the Chinese monetary system by using paper money issued by puppet organizations.

### Roosevelt's National Defense Message: Requests Huge Funds to Build Aircraft, Aviation Advisory Committee Urges Improvement of Design Efficiency, British Aviation Delegation to Australia Has Important Mission

[Central News Agency, Washington, 9th] Responsible officials announced that President Roosevelt will soon submit a national defense message to Congress, in which the part concerning the National Army advocates (1) allocating US$26,000,000 to the Army to add aircraft, so as to increase the total number of first-line aircraft to 5,300; (2) use US$41,361,000 to add 900 aircraft to the Navy, so that the total number of aircraft for both the Army and Navy will be increased to 10,000. From the perspective of increasing the first-line aircraft to 600, it is possible to be prepared for any eventuality.

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] The US National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics recently reported to Congress that foreign countries are making every effort to expand military and commercial aircraft, which is a challenge to the leadership of the United States in aviation. The committee insisted that the efficiency of aircraft design is more important than the quantity of aircraft. From the standpoint of national defense, it is extremely important that the efficiency of American aircraft should be superior to or equal to that of its potential enemies. Therefore, the manufacture of aircraft should be increased, and huge sums should be allocated and engaged in aviation research and experimentation. According to reports, the famous aviator Colonel Lindbergh and aircraft inventor Lee de Forest are members of the committee.

[Reuters, London, 9th] According to this agency's aviation correspondent, the British aviation inspection delegation to Australia has a very important mission. The aircraft manufactured in Australia are designed to be sufficient to defend Australia. In an emergency, it must also supply the needs of New Zealand and Singapore. Therefore, both ends of the British Empire's airline need a large number of aircraft to be produced.

### US National Defense Conference: Opposes the Expansion of the Pacific Naval Base, Suggestion

[Associated Press, Washington, 10th] The US "National Conference on the Prevention of War" attacked the proposal to expand the Pacific naval base, and was particularly critical of defending Guam, believing that the US Navy intends to continue to be responsible for its national defense after Philippine independence. The meeting also pointed out that the content of Roosevelt's diplomatic policy includes: 1) establishing a naval base in the Pacific, 2) revising the Neutrality Act, and 3) punishing aggressor nations. The most important construction of the Luoshi's implementation of his Far East policy is the establishment of the Guam naval base. The distance from the jurisdiction to Hawaii is 3,337 miles, and on the channel from the island to the Philippines, there are Japanese mandated islands. In the Navy Department's report, it is necessary to turn Guam into a "strong forward fleet base." Xiang Tanbai claimed that after Guam is defended, the Philippines can be protected from any country's infringement. The General Assembly pointed out, "The danger of this kind of action is obviously visible, because the area of naval operations is more distant from our country's mainland, thus increasing the risk of conflict, and at a minimum, the Navy will assume that the government is responsible for the national defense of the Philippines. The cost of the Guam naval base has not been published, but naval personnel believe that at least 200,000,000 coins are required to make Guam defensible. Furthermore, the United States Navy recommends the establishment of 41 bases, 15 of which must be established immediately and cannot be delayed. The emphasis on the Pacific proves that the US Navy believes that in the Far East, it will be inevitable to compete with Japan." The General Assembly also stated, "President Roosevelt's speech at the opening of Congress was to test the nature of domestic public opinion before revealing the detailed plan. The first point is a proposal related to national defense, because the government feels that the people are prepared to accept the expansion plan of the army and navy. However, it is doubtful whether the government will propose proposals related to the Neutrality Act and sanctions during the Congress meeting."

### Czech-Hungarian Conflict Resolved Completely: Establishment of Neutral Zone on the Border, Exchange of Prisoners by Both Sides

[Haitong News Agency, Prague, 10th] The military conflict between the Czech Republic and Hungary that occurred on the border last Friday has been completely resolved with the decision to establish a neutral zone yesterday.

### Potential for Conflict Between Germany and the United States: US Foreign Affairs Association Believes Greatly Increased, South America Prevents National Socialism

[Central News Agency, New York, 9th] The Foreign Affairs Association recently published an article stating that since the Munich Agreement, the potential for conflict between Germany and the United States has greatly increased. Since that time, Germany has no longer attacked the Soviet Union, France, and Czechoslovakia, but has focused on attacking the United Kingdom and the United States. The country's attitude is aimed at controlling the world, which may lead to conflicts with the United States in South America and with the United Kingdom in Africa. These conflicts will not necessarily be armed conflicts, but Germany can use threats, propaganda, and various methods of economic expansion to dispute with the United Kingdom and the United States. The country has already used this method to annex Austria and the Sudetenland without bloodshed. Why not apply it to South America? The conclusion is that the United States is now preparing to strengthen the defenses of Latin American countries to prevent the intrusion of National Socialism.

Brief Comments

### Pay Attention to Chen Bijun's Activities

This newspaper was the first to publish the news of Wang Jingwei's wife, Chen Bijun, arriving in Hong Kong. This has now been confirmed by various sources. In the past, Chen Bijun bore a significant responsibility for Wang's several attempts to instigate political changes, which has long been an open secret. This time, Wang has betrayed the motherland and his whereabouts are secretive, while Chen Bijun is running around actively. We cannot but call on all relevant parties to be vigilant and pay attention. Furthermore, we would like to advise Chen Bijun: you once saved Wang's life, which only made you a meritorious figure in the Wang family, but Wang's concentration of power led to his downfall and he has become a sinner to the entire Chinese nation! We dare not expect you to follow the example of prominent figures in various industries, but at the very least we hope you preserve the minimum "integrity" of your husband and take good care of him while he is "sick" abroad!

### Winning Over Allied Troops in the Enemy Camp

The main conditions for our victory in the War of Resistance are (1) China's progress, (2) the enemy's difficulties, and (3) international assistance. We are striving for progress in our own political and military affairs and for the success of international assistance, while also increasing the enemy's difficulties. However, we must not forget to win over allied troops against the enemy in the enemy camp!

Some people believe that trying to win over allied troops in the enemy camp is completely a fantasy. In fact, this statement only shows that they do not understand the significance of this Sino-Japanese War. Because this Japanese war of aggression against China is, on the one hand, a war of absolute opposition between the entire Chinese nation, and on the other hand, a war of opposition against the interests of the entire Japanese people and the Taiwanese people. Our War of Resistance is not only a war for China's own liberation, but also an anti-fascist war, which will inevitably help the Japanese and Taiwanese people to be liberated from fascist oppression.

Now the Japanese aggressors are stepping up their march towards fascist autocracy. The conflict between the invading warlords and the people is becoming more and more serious. The opportunity for us to win over allied troops in the enemy camp is maturing day by day. We must work as closely as possible to win over puppet troops to revolt and enemy troops to defect!

### The Development of the Situation in Southeastern Europe

— (Special Correspondent for this newspaper in London) Uncle

The development of the situation in Southeastern Europe has a significant impact on the overall situation of the world, even of Europe. Its scope of influence is mainly on the relations between the major European powers. The upcoming Rome talks between Chamberlain and Mussolini are based there. As far as is known, Southeastern Europe is one of the most important items. Therefore, on the eve of these Rome talks, I think it is necessary to briefly report on the recent development of the situation. The term "Southeastern Europe" here refers to the five countries of the Balkan Peninsula, plus Poland, the European part of Turkey, and Hungary, etc.

When we talk about the recent development of the situation in Southeastern Europe, the first thing that catches our attention is France's temporary withdrawal from the Southeastern European stage after the Munich Conference; the second thing that catches our attention is Germany's resounding expansion of power; the third is Italy's anxiety and unease; then comes Britain's activities; and finally, it should be Soviet Russia's recent diplomatic offensive in that area. Although the specific results for the future are not yet known, the possible significant results of the development trend of the current situation are: (1) In the case of Germany's complete victory, it would completely become its vassal; (2) In the case of Italy's complete victory, except for Albania, which would still maintain its vassal status as before, the rest of the areas would be divided equally between Germany and Italy. This equal division relationship would then be mediated by Britain, playing the role of a mediator; (3) In the case of Britain's complete victory, it would take advantage of the friction between Germany and Italy to break up the "Berlin-Rome Axis" and limit German activities to Poland and Hungary in the east, especially to prevent any major power from extending its influence to Turkey's Dardanelles Strait; Finally, assuming that Soviet Russia's diplomatic offensive is completely victorious, it would be the formation of a group of Southeastern European countries, with the Soviet Union as its background, to resist any invaders from the West. This is the general outline of the recent strategies of the five major powers of France, Germany, Italy, Britain, and Russia surrounding Southeastern Europe. Now, let's talk about Southeastern Europe itself.

Poland

Poland, which has always been regarded as a supporting actor in the German-Italian group, unexpectedly joined hands with Soviet Russia after the Munich Conference. The degree of this collaboration has been further consolidated after the recent signing of the "no more war" declaration between Germany and France. Because, as far as is now known, when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was staying in Paris, he assured French Foreign Minister Bonnet that Germany's main "interest" in the future was in the East, not in the French territory in the West, so he asked France to rest assured and requested France to give a promise, that is, France would no longer interfere in Germany's eastward development in the future. When France was unable to take care of herself, of course, Daladier and Bonnet had only one way to obey Germany's will. However, when this news was learned by Poland, it immediately keenly realized that Germany's so-called eastward route had three meanings for Poland itself: (1) demanding the return of the "Polish Corridor"; (2) requiring Poland to cede territory for Germany's development route to Soviet Ukraine, completely isolating Poland from the countries of Southeastern Europe; (3) transferring the territory Poland had obtained from Czechoslovakia to Germany. However, Poland thinks that Germany will definitely make demands on her in the near future. If Poland does not agree, then it will definitely incite the minority German nation in Poland to demand so-called "autonomy"; if necessary, Germany will use force to "liberate" this minority nation. Therefore, in order to resist this danger, Poland's first step is to strengthen the hand-in-hand relationship between Soviet Russia and Poland, and the second step is to send 50,000 troops to be stationed on Poland's western border in order to cope with a possible German invasion.

If Germany presses further, then the friendly relationship between Soviet Russia and Poland will be advanced to a military alliance in one fell swoop.

Turkey

After Kemal's death, the major influence on Turkey's diplomacy was the loss of a pro-British leader. Therefore, within a short period of time, Britain's leading position in Turkey's diplomacy was shaken. Therefore, Germany, Britain, and Russia simultaneously began diplomatic activities towards Turkey.

Britain's current attitude is that Chamberlain believes that there is no need to oppose Germany's economic activities in Turkey; but important German political activities should be limited to "eastward" countries such as Poland and Hungary, and should not "southward" to Turkey and Romania. Especially in order to maintain the transportation line between Britain and India, Britain absolutely cannot allow any major power to extend its influence to the Dardanelles Strait. However, on the German side, in addition to economic activities, the most important goal is precisely to obtain Turkey's consent in order to strengthen its position in the Dardanelles Strait. In the event of war, it can advance north to attack Soviet Russia from the Black Sea, and south to attack the transportation line between Britain and India. The Soviet Union, of course, absolutely cannot sit idly by and watch Turkey join the sphere of German influence.

According to the official statement of Turkey, its foreign policy in the future is consistent with Kemal's era; however, the trend of changing from being unilaterally pro-British to maneuvering among Britain, Germany, and Russia in order to enhance its own position is very obvious.

Hungary

Hungary, which is generally considered to have long been destined to be a German protectorate, does not think so in the minds of its own rulers. On the eve of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, its rulers cleverly avoided the danger of Czechoslovakia being annexed by Germany first; afterwards, they used Italy's support to alleviate Germany's annexation attempts. Now, in order to prevent future dangers, it is constantly planning to create a common border between the two countries with Poland on the disputed territory in order to jointly cope with Germany's future annexation. Therefore, it demanded that Czechoslovakia cede Ruthenia. This demand caused major dissatisfaction with Germany; however, because it had Italy's support, Germany could not openly oppose it. Therefore, Hitler reflected the current rulers of Czechoslovakia and asked Britain and France to fulfill their promise to jointly guarantee the new borders of Czechoslovakia. Here, Chamberlain did not hesitate to lift a finger to win Hitler's favor, so he immediately prevented the realization of Hungary's demands and declared that Britain and France would absolutely safeguard Czechoslovakia's new borders.

After the failure of the plan to establish a common border with Poland, Hungary immediately turned its eyes to the south. Now, it is considering whether it should form an alliance with Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Greece, etc., with Soviet Russia as its background, to jointly resist all territorial aggression, and what is being considered as a prerequisite is that Otto Dada become the Emperor of Hungary. On the one hand, because he is Hitler's mortal enemy, on the other hand, it is hoped that the alliance will be established through the connection between the royal families of the above-mentioned countries through royal relations.

Balkan Peninsula

Among the countries of the Balkan Peninsula, Romania has been the most active recently. Not long ago, Romanian King Carol traveled busily between countries such as Britain and Germany. The results he obtained were: first, a credit loan from Britain; second, thanks to the arrangement of Chamberlain and Halifax, he will have formal talks with Italy's Mussolini in the not-too-distant future; third, in Germany, he was pressured by Hitler to release Codreanu, the leader of the organization similar to the National Socialist Party of Romania, the so-called "Iron Guard". However, when Carol returned to Romania, he immediately executed Codreanu and completely disbanded the National Socialist-style organization. In addition, in countries such as Albania and Bulgaria, pro-German reactionary organizations are also actively operating, and even Mussolini feels uneasy.

Because of various common interests, the general staffs of Greece, Romania, Turkey, and Yugoslavia secretly held an important meeting in Athens, the capital of Greece, more than ten days ago, with Greek General Papagos presiding over everything. The most important resolutions are: 1. Further strengthen mutual military assistance; 2. Mutually guarantee the complete independence of the countries of the Balkan Peninsula.

At the end of this article, I would like to repeat one sentence: All those who care about the future destiny of Southeastern Europe should pay close attention to the upcoming Rome talks between Chamberlain and Mussolini.

### The Relief Federation Held Its 31st General Meeting Yesterday; A Heated Debate Erupted Over the Request for Relief Funds from Boluo; Pan Fan'an Pleaded for Expedited Allocation on the Grounds That Disaster Relief Was Like Fighting Fire; Li Jianfeng Insisted on Following Precedent; A Compromise Was Reached

The Hong Kong Joint Committee of All Circles for Relief of South China Refugees held its 31st meeting at 3:00 p.m. yesterday on the fourth floor of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. Those present included Lu Fu and Li Huiquan of the Chinese Arts Association, Li Jianfeng of the Journalists Association, Lin Zengsheng of Tung Wah Hospital, Lin Ciming of the Kwong Luen Chamber of Commerce, Zhou Xingchi of the Sun Wui Commercial Society, Liu Qingxuan of the Women's War Relief Association, Pan Fan'an and Lu Guomian of the Chung Sing Benevolent Society, Li Bingsen of the Panyu Commercial Society, He Xiangning of the Women's Comfort Association, Chen Zhongchi of the Zhongshan Commercial Society, Mao Heyuan of the Central Relief Commission, Liao Jian of the Yee On Company, Pan Bingji of the Po On Commercial Society, Su Anping of the Women's New Movement Association, Xie Yaoxiang of the Tung Koon Commercial Society, Hong Liang of the Cattle and Sheep Industry General Union, Huang Ruiquan of the Overseas Panyu Northern Education Relief Association, Chen Yanfu of the Theater Workers' General Union, Nanfeng Society Yu, Lin Guangfu of the Hong Kong Printing Industry Workers' Union, Lin Shouqi of the Youth Overseas Chinese Ambulance Team, Liu Yingtian of the Hong Kong Tailors' Union, Liang Ruikun of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association, Huang Lianfu of the Chong Zheng Commercial Society, Jian Chinnan of the Miscellaneous Timber Merchants Association, Su Chaojian of the Meat Industry Commercial Society, Shan Dexin of the YWCA, and Ye Lanquan of the Manufacturers' Association. Lu Fu, representing the Planning Group, chaired the meeting, and Shi Bohan recorded the minutes. During the meeting, a fierce debate erupted over the case of the Chuan Lo Relief Association requesting funds for relief. At the same time, the previous meeting resolved to allocate 5,000 yuan of national currency to be discussed by the Panyu Commercial Society and the Overseas Panyu Northern Education Relief Association for disaster relief. However, the Panyu Commercial Society only allocated 3,000 yuan for relief in northern Panyu, and the remaining 2,000 yuan was reserved for relief elsewhere, which also sparked a debate. Excerpts from the meeting are as follows:

General Affairs and Finance Reports

1. The General Affairs Group reported on: 1. Received letters from the Western District Six Districts Joint Relief Office for Refugees, the Anti-Drug Promotion Association, the Boluo Refugee Relief Association, and the Dongbao Hui Border Area Guerrilla Brigade, one official letter each, and one official letter from the Relief Department. 2. Reported on the resolutions of the Standing Committee meeting. (2) The Finance Group reported (from January 5th to January 9th, 1939): Hong Kong dollars received included 100 yuan from the Causeway Bay Da Hang North Point Joint Relief Fundraising Association, and 3 yuan from Yiyou Xuan. The total received this week was 103 yuan. The total received to date is 102,421.63 yuan. Expenditures included 13,000 yuan for the General Affairs Department. The total expenditure this week was 13,000 yuan. The total expenditure to date is 82,829.25 yuan. The balance between income and expenditure is 19,592.38 yuan at the Bank of China (including 3 yuan at the accounting office of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce). The national currency received included 100 yuan from Zeng Guihe and 95 yuan from the Polly Phemus dockworkers. The total received this week was 195 yuan. The total received to date is 83,555.37 yuan. National currency expenditures included 5,000 yuan for the General Affairs Department. The total expenditure this week was 5,000 yuan. The total expenditure to date is 22,480 yuan. The balance between income and expenditure is 61,075.37 yuan at the Guangdong Provincial Bank (with 195 yuan check deposited in the accounting office of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce). The reports of the other groups were omitted.

Discussion Items; Five Items Resolved

Discussion items: (1) The total income and expenditure of the association's disaster relief funds for the 27th year (1938) need to be announced urgently. The relevant groups should report in detail as soon as possible. It is proposed to send letters to the groups and organizations receiving disaster relief funds from the association, asking them to report in writing in detail to the association before February 1st to clear the procedures and make it public. The resolution was passed. (2) It is proposed that in the future, for domestic disaster relief that the association is capable of handling, the association's relief group will directly or assist in handling it. If the association is not capable of handling it, it will entrust trustworthy organizations in various counties or the disaster relief groups requesting assistance to distribute the relief funds on their behalf. They must report the disaster relief situation and the amount of income and expenditure to the association for verification. The funds will be paid by the General Affairs Group. The resolution was passed. (3) The Boluo Relief Association requested funds for disaster relief. The resolution was to hand it over to the investigation group for investigation. Then, the general meeting authorized the standing committee to convene a temporary standing committee meeting to decide on the amount of funds to be allocated, and submit it to the next general meeting for ratification (this resolution was passed, limited to this time only, and cannot be used as a precedent next time). (4) The Dongbao Hui Border Area Guerrilla Brigade requested a monthly subsidy of 100 Hong Kong dollars and a batch of cotton clothing and medicines. The resolution was to hand it over to the investigation group for investigation, and then discuss it at the next meeting. (5) Regarding the association's allocation of 5,000 yuan of national currency to the Overseas Panyu Northern Education Relief Association, how to proceed with the case was resolved by asking the Overseas Panyu Northern Education Relief Association and the Panyu Commercial Society to list the required items, which would be purchased by the association. Those that cannot be purchased in Hong Kong will be entrusted to the Overseas Panyu Northern Education Relief Association to carry out disaster relief on their behalf.

Heated Debate Erupts Over Boluo's Request for Funds

According to the Zhen Lianhui (Relief Federation) yesterday, when discussing the Boluo Relief Association's request for funds for disaster relief, the situation was extremely tense. The motions were changed several times and were almost impossible to pass. According to past precedents for requesting funds for disaster relief, no matter which organization requested the general meeting to allocate funds for relief, the procedure was for the general meeting to hand it over to the investigation group as usual to investigate the severity of the disaster, the amount of funds needed, and whether the requesting organization was trustworthy and reportable to the general meeting. Then, the general meeting would decide on the amount of funds to be allocated. At the same time, if the general meeting was capable of handling it, the general meeting would send its own personnel to handle it. Otherwise, it would be entrusted to the requesting organization to handle it on its behalf. Yesterday, in the case of Boluo's request for funds, Pan Fan'an, considering that disaster relief was like fighting fire, advocated that the amount of disaster relief funds be set immediately, and the investigation group would be responsible for consulting the Huiyang Commercial Society, and then handed over to the Boluo Relief Association to carry out disaster relief. After the motion was passed, Li Jianfeng of the Journalists Association suddenly firmly raised an objection, believing that it violated past precedents. As a result, the other parties expressed their opinions and the debate was extremely fierce. At that time, the representatives present expressed sympathy for the refugees in Boluo. Although the chairman proposed a re-vote, the original motion was still maintained. Then, Liu Qingxuan, the representative of the Women's War Relief Association, proposed a compromise method to hand over the case to the investigation group. After the investigation group could investigate and confirm the case within two or three days, a temporary meeting of the standing committee would be convened to discuss the disaster relief plan, and then submit it to the next general meeting for ratification. Only then was it unanimously passed, but a lot of time had already been debated. It is hoped that in the future, the association will clearly stipulate the precedents for requesting funds for disaster relief (such as detailed rules), otherwise, there will be more debates and disputes in the future, and the representatives present will not know what to do.

Opinions Also Differ on Relief in Northern Panyu

Also, when discussing the second case, Li Jianfeng of the Journalists Association also raised inquiries about the previous motion record, allocating 1,000 yuan of national currency to relieve the refugees in the disaster area of northern Panyu. The representative of the Panyu Association gave a reply, followed by a report from Lin Peisheng of the Relief Group, undertaking the task of investigating and relieving the refugees in northern Panyu under the order of the general meeting. He said that the 30th meeting of the general meeting had resolved to allocate 1,000 yuan of national currency and hand it over to the Relief Group to handle the relief of refugees in northern Panyu. He immediately consulted with the representatives of the Overseas Panyu Association and the representatives of northern Panyu on the relief plan, and the representatives of northern Panyu agreed to transfer all the relief funds of 5,000 yuan to the Panyu Association to receive and handle. Then, the representative of the Overseas Panyu Northern Education Relief Association expressed agreement with Lin's report and said that the Panyu Association had transferred 3,000 yuan of national currency to the Association from the funds. Then, the representatives present expressed their opinions, which were different. The chairman then summarized the opinions of the people and re-voted on the case. The resolution was to allocate 5,000 yuan of national currency to relieve the refugees in Panyu and northern Panyu. As for the required items, please ask the representatives of northern Panyu and the Panyu Association to list the list, which will be purchased by the general meeting from the funds.

### Bandits Rampant in Baoan County Near Hong Kong Border, Preying on Refugees Under Pretense of Inspection and Robbery

Recently, in the Dongjiang area, our forces launched a major counter-offensive, and the enemy troops are retreating in disarray. Baoan, Boluo, Huizhou, and their affiliated areas are being successively recovered by our forces. In recent days, refugees who had come to Hong Kong, believing that these counties were now in our hands and the areas had returned to peace, have been leaving Hong Kong to return to their hometowns. Many of them were carrying valuables, which attracted the attention of traitors and bandits, who seized the opportunity to rob them. Yesterday, a villager from Li Lang village in Baoan County came to Hong Kong and told reporters that bandits are extremely rampant in the Li Lang, Buji, and Shatou areas. They operate in groups of three to five, lurking along various transportation routes, falsely claiming to be members of certain guerilla teams, self-defense corps, or military units, under the pretext of body searches and inspections, seizing the opportunity to rob people. In the past half-month, countless refugees returning from Hong Kong have been robbed, even of their clothes, shoes, and hats. The cries of the people echo along the roads, creating a very tragic scene. Those fleeing from the mainland to Hong Kong who pass through the area are also frequently targeted. Currently, Tan Sui, the Deputy Commander of the Eastern Garrison, has dispatched a large detachment of armed police to strictly maintain security and defense. He advises those fleeing to Hong Kong or returning from Hong Kong to be vigilant.

### Fifth Plenary Session Approaching, Central Committee Members Remaining in Hong Kong to Return to Country in Batches to Attend, Lu Yougang and Others Departed from Hong Kong Yesterday via Zhen to Sichuan, to Propose the Arrest of Wang Jingwei and Relief for Guangdong Refugees

The first batch, including Chen Yaoyuan and Lu Yougang, departed yesterday on the Compagnie Maritime des Chargeurs Réunis mail steamer "Guangzhou" for Haiphong, en route to Sichuan via Yunnan. The remaining committee members will depart today or tomorrow, striving to arrive before the session begins. Furthermore, the proposals to be submitted by the Central Committee members remaining in Hong Kong include, in addition to supporting the resistance against Japan to the end and the arrest of Wang Jingwei, the urgent need for relief for the Guangdong refugees, who have suffered greatly since Guangdong was ravaged by the Japanese, and the strengthening of popular armaments for defending the territory and resisting Japan.

### Jinshan Steamer Sails for Province This Morning

### Intense Solar Flare Eruptions, Prolonged Drought in Hong Kong is an Effect

Last year was the second driest year in Hong Kong since weather records began. This drought condition has not yet improved. Since the beginning of last month until today, there have been only a few light rains. According to recent observations by meteorologists, this abnormal atmosphere is due to intense solar flare eruptions, what is known in meteorology as sunspots. The area of the solar flare eruption that caused this drought, though appearing as a small spot through a telescope, is actually 650 million square miles, almost three and a half times the area of the Earth.

### British Bank Announces Closure, Chartered Bank to Take Over its Business, Managers of Both Banks Issue Joint Announcement

Those presiding over the ceremony included Mrs. Li Fong (President), Wang Liming, Mrs. Guo Linzhou, and more than ten others. The president gave an inaugural address, stating that the cooperative is now officially accepting the selected refugees and holding its inauguration ceremony. The purpose of the cooperative is solely to accommodate unemployed women. The current acceptance of 50 people is due to economic constraints, so this number is temporarily accepted. In the future, if finances are sufficient, more refugees will be accepted. It is hoped that all sectors of society will donate to the cooperative so that more homeless refugees can be accommodated, and that all sectors will work hard at work, etc. After the speech, Mrs. Guo gave a speech, and Liu Liming gave an encouraging speech. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.

### Hong Kong's War on Rats: 1.5 Million Rats Killed in Eight Years

Hong Kong's campaign to eradicate rats has been going on for decades. It took a full thirty years for this campaign to produce significant "battle results," so that rats would no longer pose a threat to the population. However, this campaign continues to this day!

From 1930 to the present, more than 1.5 million rats have died under the extermination efforts of the Sanitary Department. However, I can tell you that the rat population will not be eliminated.

Half a Dollar Reward for Killing a Rat

A pair of rats can produce 1,200 offspring in twelve months. The current rat population in Hong Kong is probably two or three times greater than the human population.

In the history of rat eradication in Hong Kong, there is an interesting historical fact. It is said that the Hong Kong government implemented a "red bounty" policy for rats. Killing a rat and sending it to the Sanitary Department earned a reward of half a dollar. However, because the number of rats was too large, the policy was eventually cancelled. It is said that at that time, some people took advantage of the opportunity to import dead rats from Guangzhou and Macau to sell to the government!

A History of Plague Terror

Why is the Hong Kong government so strict about rats? Most long-time residents of Hong Kong are familiar with the story, because in 1894, a great plague occurred in the Far East. This plague originated in Yunnan, spread to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong to India and other ports in the Far East. 100,000 people died in Guangzhou, 5,000 in Hong Kong, and India was particularly affected, with a death toll of tens of millions over the years. After that year, Hong Kong rigorously implemented a rat control campaign, with "rat traps hanging on lamp posts" as its starting point. After thirty years of extermination, the plague gradually decreased. In 1929, there was only one case, and since 1930, not a single case has been found. Hong Kong's rat eradication campaign can be considered a success!

### Foreign Reporter Talks About Guangzhou, Bandit Tax Collectors Everywhere, Gambling Dens and Loud Games of Chance Everywhere

The Hong Kong Rehabilitation Association held a luncheon at the Hong Kong Hotel yesterday at 1:00 PM. In addition to dozens of members of the association, there were also many members and guests from various places, totaling about 80 people. The atmosphere was quite lively. After the meal, Dr. Li Shufen, the chairman, introduced the guests and read letters of congratulations from Shanxi, Jinshan, and other places to the association on its anniversary and New Year's greetings. Then, he introduced the foreign journalist Mr. Wilson to speak. Mr. Wilson had traveled extensively throughout China in the past three years. When Guangzhou fell, he stayed there for a long time before coming to Hong Kong. He was asked to speak about his experiences coming from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, and it was hoped that Mr. Wilson would provide the audience with a concrete description of his journey. Next, Mr. Wilson rose to speak, stating that he had left Guangzhou three weeks ago, taking the route through Shiqi to Macau. The details he described were largely the same as those reported in the newspapers, so he would not repeat them. Regarding the widespread rumors of gambling dens run by gangsters in Guangzhou, Mr. Wilson confirmed them, saying that wherever gangsters gather, there are loud games of chance, similar to the licentiousness of Las Vegas in Hollywood, USA. Furthermore, on the entire journey from Guangzhou to Shiqi, which was under the control of Japanese soldiers, he encountered "bandit tax collectors" everywhere, levying a "war tax," which was an unheard-of imposition. After the speech, Dr. Li Shufen, the chairman, invited Mr. Shen Hanyang, the chief editor of the English-language South China Morning Post and a member of the association, to give a thank-you speech. The meeting was then adjourned.

### Modern Woman Commits Suicide by Poisoning on Fifth Floor of America Hotel, Found Dead Next Morning After One Night's Stay, Cause Unknown

A modern woman committed suicide by poisoning yesterday morning at the America Hotel on Des Voeux Road Central. The deceased was a young woman of only eighteen years old. She checked into the hotel the night before and was found dead in bed yesterday morning. Police detectives are currently investigating the cause of her suicide. The body has been sent to the mortuary for autopsy. Upon receiving the news, reporters went to the scene to investigate.

Checked in Alone

The suicide scene was the room 505 on the fifth floor. According to the staff on the fifth floor, the deceased checked into the hotel at 6:20 PM the night before, wearing a grey-blue patterned short-sleeved cheongsam and a black jacket. She had no luggage. After checking in, she went straight to the fifth floor and stayed in room 505, which costs $2.70 per day. The deceased paid a deposit of $2.75. In the hotel registry, she filled in the name "Li," 18 years old, from Guangdong, having come from Hong Kong. The deceased was beautiful and dressed very fashionably. Judging by her behavior, she seemed to be a young girl, but according to her registration, she seemed to be a married woman. The deceased's demeanor was normal when she checked in, and she did not go out after checking in. The poison she took seemed to have been prepared beforehand.

Found Poisoned

At 8:30 AM yesterday morning, the male and female attendants on the floor were cleaning the rooms. The cleaning lady wanted to bring tea to room 505, so she called from outside the door, but there was no response. The cleaning lady then knocked hard on the door, but there was still no answer. The cleaning lady initially thought that the guest was sleeping soundly, so she knocked repeatedly, but there was still no sound. Realizing that something was wrong, she reported it to the manager. The manager opened the door. The deceased was lying on the bed, facing outwards. He shook her body and called her name several times, but there was no response. Upon closer inspection, he saw foam flowing from her mouth and nose, and her face was turning black. He felt her pulse and found it very weak. The manager saw three teacups, a jar of hair cream, and a lot of opium on the dresser. The teacups were full of smoke stains, so he knew that she had taken poison.

Found Possessions

He immediately notified the police station. The police station notified the ambulance to come to the scene, intending to send the deceased to the hospital, but she died en route. The body was sent to the mortuary. The police also came to investigate, questioning the attendants on the floor. A white handkerchief and a package wrapped in newspaper, seemingly a suicide note or photos, were found on the dresser. The cause of the deceased's suicide is currently unknown.

### Another New Contingent Marching Towards the Motherland's Front Lines: The Fourth Service Corps of the Student Relief Association Sets Out to Serve the Country

"Countless fine sons and daughters of China, write history with blood like a tide," these are the words of Mr. Tian Han.

In the motherland, in the exchange of blood and fire, under the fierce attacks of bombs, in the tragedy of human annihilation, countless young people of the new China are fighting arduously, determined to sacrifice their blood and flesh to participate in this sacred war of self-defense, to save the Chinese nation from the crisis of extinction, and to seek liberation from the realm of semi-colonialism. In the occupied areas, on the front lines, after seven months of arduous struggle, although countless young people have sacrificed "for righteousness," countless young people immediately fill the vacant positions. They are writing an epic of the liberation of the Chinese nation with their blood. In Hong Kong, the "paradise of adventurers," although countless young men and women are intoxicated by jazz music and wine, on the other hand, countless young people with burning hearts are working seriously, boldly organizing "Return to the Country Service Corps" with the determination to sacrifice, and rushing to the embrace of the motherland!

The "Student Relief Association," which arose in the wake of the "July 7th" incident, is a product forged by Hong Kong students in the crucible of the great era. The Hong Kong student youth group has grown up in arduous struggle. In the past few months, under the surge of boiling blood, it has already organized three service corps to return to the country to work. Now, the fourth group has been established, a new contingent of thirty enthusiastic young people, with solemn and tense hearts, will rush to the motherland's front lines in the next few days. Undoubtedly, they will contribute to the liberation of the Chinese nation, fulfill their responsibility to the motherland, and become a powerful link in the Chinese nation's war of resistance.

When the reporter stepped into the Student Relief Association, a group of young people was working seriously and tensely. They were planning for their departure. The young leader shook hands warmly with the reporter and told me about the process of their organization and their work policy:

"We are ashamed to form this service corps with our weak strength. Of course, we dare not expect good results, but we believe that our work policy is not wrong." The young leader said politely, "Yes, in this sacred war of resistance, the motherland needs everyone to contribute their strength. Therefore, our thirty comrades, with the greatest determination to sacrifice, are rushing to the motherland. We will follow a certain division headquarters guarding the front lines of Sihui and Mafang, and provide military service. Although our skills are only to rescue wounded soldiers, comfort soldiers, and engage in political propaganda, we will organize the masses to participate in the war of resistance against Japan, seeking to achieve a true national war of self-defense. At the same time, we are also preparing to open refugee schools and promote rural culture. We are boldly taking on this responsibility..."

"Are your comrades all students?" I interjected with this sentence.

"Of course, most of us are students, but there are also many cultural workers. Therefore, in our purpose, we have implemented 'working and studying at the same time.' In the motherland's time of crisis today, we are no longer allowed to sit idly in classrooms like prisoners. We will serve the country on the one hand, and implement the method of 'self-education' on the other hand, to continuously increase our knowledge. We have truly run into the 'social university' that Gorky mentioned." The young leader paused slightly and continued, "Also, the soldiers on the front lines are lacking medicine. This will affect the direction of the war of resistance. Winter is coming, and cotton clothes are also urgently needed by the soldiers. We are all students, and we certainly cannot talk about material strength, so we hope for the assistance of overseas Chinese, to bring comfort items to the front lines. At the same time, we also hope that overseas Chinese will donate an ambulance, which is also urgently needed." Their departure date is probably set for around the 20th of this month!

With a warm handshake, I silently wished them well and bid farewell to this group of young fighters. On the way home, I realized with excitement that the youth of Hong Kong are not completely anesthetized. Their arduous struggle under material deprivation really moved me - this is truly moving. I will appeal to the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, in order to win the victory of the nation, let us all do our best!

Special Report from this Newspaper

### Progress from Bloody Lessons: The Active West River Guerrilla Force: A Record of Meeting with Zhu Man, Detachment Commander of the Guerrilla Force

—Qi Zhuo

After the fall of Guangzhou, the West River guerrilla force emerged with a difficult and active posture.

The reasons for the rapid progress of the guerrilla force: first, the authorities accepted the bloody lessons and actively planned; second, the example of the occupied areas made the people realize that they should arm themselves to protect their homeland, and that only their own force is the most reliable force.

What is the recent situation of the West River guerrilla force? Yesterday, the reporter met with Zhu Man, the detachment commander of the ×× Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Guerrilla Detachment of the Tax Police Regiment, and learned a little. It is urgent to report to the overseas Chinese who care about the motherland.

According to Commander Zhu, "Before Guangzhou fell, there were only self-defense corps in the West River area. After the fall of Guangzhou, the anti-Japanese work in the area became tense, and at the same time, more people planned there. After October 27, when the Japanese advanced to Mianjiang, the local people truly felt the hideous faces of the Japanese and their brutal acts, and everyone strengthened their determination to protect their homeland and refreshed their spirit of taking righteousness and dying for it. The progress of anti-Japanese work was unprecedentedly smooth. The guerrilla force was established, and the enthusiasm of the participants deeply moved anyone who saw it. Later, after the battles of Makou, Mafang, and Qingqi, everyone saw the weaknesses and incompetence of the Japanese. The Japanese advance seemed very fierce, but after the heroic resistance of the guerrilla force, the Japanese forces showed their vulnerability everywhere. Finally, they had to gather in one or two strongholds and use strong firepower to cover themselves. Moreover, the morale of the Japanese was extremely low, which made our guerrilla force even more confident. At the same time, there was a sense of certainty of victory everywhere, so the number of people joining the guerrilla force became even more enthusiastic. As of last month, the total number of guerrilla forces between Sanshui and Sihui was no less than ten detachments.

"The planning of the guerrilla force adopts a mass movement approach. Resolute people do their individual work on weekdays, such as farming, working, and doing business... When the Japanese attack, they come out to resist Japan and defend their homeland. This must be said to be a kind of progress.

"In addition, war zone work teams have been organized, and there are no restrictions on men, women, old, and young. They all have their own tasks and their own command. This kind of organization has developed rapidly and has shown good results. In areas close to the Japanese, the work of clearing the fields and strengthening the walls also depends on them to carry out.

"Recently, the contact between the various teams has become closer, and the steps have become more consistent, which is the most gratifying thing for the planners.

"Although the Japanese have reached Mianjiang and Lianjiang, they have made no further progress. They are trying their best to increase their actions, but they are at a loss. In the future, even if the Japanese increase their strength, no matter where they reach in the West River, they will be fatally hit."

After listening to Commander Zhu's report, there are a few points worth noting.

First, the style of common development - Commander Zhu originally reported many details about the tax police regiment guerrilla force he directly led, which was also quite comforting to the compatriots; however, Commander Zhu repeatedly instructed that it was inconvenient to publish it, for fear that other guerrilla units would flaunt themselves, which would hinder the united front. Therefore, only the general dynamics of the West River guerrilla force were allowed to be published, and he hoped to have a more detailed overall report in the future. This style of overcoming the love of the limelight and common development is indeed a belief that those engaged in salvation work should have. Many young people have made progress in the practice of the war of resistance, and Commander Zhu is one of them.

Second, the spirit of abandoning politics and joining the military - since the sacred national war of resistance began, there have been many who abandoned their pens and joined the army, and there have also been quite a few who abandoned politics and joined the military. Commander Zhu was originally an employee of the Guangzhou Municipal Government. Because of the outbreak of the war, he was filled with righteous indignation and came out to lead the guerrilla force, shedding the uniform of public affairs and wearing a blue cloth gown like the common people. His heart was very enthusiastic, but his attitude was very calm. He reported the military situation fluently, like a military general who had experienced the battlefield. There are quite a few typical young people like this who have grown up in the war of resistance, which is perhaps a symbol of the improvement of the national fortune.

Third, the serious problem of cadre shortages - Regarding mobilizing the masses and launching guerrilla warfare, the most difficult thing at present is the lack of cadres. According to Commander Zhu, it is very necessary to have a group of people to approach the masses, organize the masses, and educate the masses. Such talents are very scarce at present. In the self-defense corps and the study teams, there is also a great need for politically trained talents, and such cadres are also very scarce. Therefore, he and a certain gentleman discussed that it is very necessary to train a group of new cadres who meet the needs of the objective situation and return to the mainland to start work. This is indeed a problem worthy of attention.

The West River guerrilla force bears the important task of counterattacking Guangzhou and protecting the Southwest. We sincerely pray that it will grow up healthily and become active. We deeply hope that the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong will give it their care and assistance.

Transportation and Travel

### Gushan in Fuzhou

— Shao Yanqing

Almost everyone who has been to Minhou knows about Gushan in Fuzhou. The mountain is located nine kilometers east of the provincial capital, guarding the throat of the Min River as it enters the sea. It has peaks like Jueding, Baiyun, Shizi, and Bomeng, as well as Zhuoxi Peak. Among them, Jueding Peak is the highest, reaching 1,000 meters above sea level. Ascending the peak and looking into the distance, the topography of the Min River and sea areas is clearly visible.

Because there is a huge rock on the peak that resembles a stone drum, it is said that during storms, it makes a sound like a drum, hence the name Gushan (Drum Mountain). At the mountainside is the Yongquan Zen Temple, which is popularly said to have been built during the Five Dynasties period. Emperor Zhenzong of the Song Dynasty once bestowed a plaque that read "Yongquan Temple at Baiyun Peak, Gushan". It was changed to a temple during the Ming Dynasty, and later burned down. Construction was not resumed until the Qing Dynasty. Legend has it that the person who initially built the temple was Master Zu, who built it after fighting a giant dragon entrenched on Gushan. However, this is just a myth about the opening of the mountain and the construction of the temple, and cannot be taken as reliable historical fact.

The scenery of Gushan is extremely beautiful. The mountains are covered with lush forests, and the misty peaks are secluded and beautiful. There are so many famous scenic spots that it is difficult to list them all. Among the more well-known ones are Heshui Rock, the Heavenly Ladder, Longji Road, Yinyue Pool, the Eighteen Caves, and the Eighteen Views. However, what makes Gushan most worth lingering over is the lush pine and cypress trees everywhere. When the wind blows, the sound of the waves is like a raging tide surging and ten thousand horses galloping, majestic and grand. In the spring, clear spring water flows through the mountain valleys, and the constant sound of trickling water is sent into the ears of tourists, making them forget the fatigue of climbing up and down the mountain slopes.

All of this has made Gushan a center for well-known travelers and devout worshippers. Every year, there are about 100,000 pilgrims and students who come to worship and travel. It is said that Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government is also a frequent visitor to Gushan.

The impression I have of Gushan dates back to when I was studying in Fujian as a child. I remember that when I thought of this towering mountain, my young heart felt a little stirred, but due to inconvenient transportation, I never went to visit it. After leaving Fujian, I went to other provinces and then became burdened by life, so there were even fewer opportunities to visit this famous mountain. In order to comfort my long-unfulfilled desire, this autumn, I managed to take a short vacation and quietly left bustling Shanghai with my wife on a boat. On October 6th, the boat arrived at Magang in Fuzhou, and we finally set foot on our long-separated homeland, feeling a surge of unspeakable joy in our hearts.

The morning after arriving in Fujian, we went to Gushan with several relatives from Minzhong. The construction of Fuzhou in recent years has indeed progressed a lot. In the past, to go to Gushan, only waterway transportation was available, and even when the wind and waves were calm, it still took half a day of rowing. Now it is different. You can take a long-distance bus on the Fuma (Fuzhou to Mawei) highway from the South Gate of the provincial capital, and it only takes half an hour to reach the foot of Gushan, which is really convenient.

Because I had been away for many years, everything seemed unfamiliar. Sitting in the bumpy car, I found it quite interesting to look at the street scenes of Fuzhou. After the car left the city, my mind felt refreshed. Looking out the car window, a vast expanse of yellow rice fields, set against the clear blue sky, revealed brightness and serenity under the bright sun.

After the car arrived at Gushan, we jumped out and walked a few dozen steps to the Baiyun Pavilion next to the foot of the mountain, where we hired a sedan chair to pile the clothes, mirror boxes, and suitcases we had brought. Only then did we feel relaxed, and we strode up the neat and long stone steps. The morning breeze blowing on our faces felt slightly cool. The rising sun was shaded by the dense trees, making the scene even more secluded. However, when we occasionally looked up, the hazy sunlight covered the branches on the right side of the road, seeming to hold our boundless warmth and comfort.

From the mountain gate, following the main road to Yongquan Temple, there are more than 1,500 stone steps. Along the way, there are five pavilions. After passing through the third pavilion, we turned onto a small path. Along the road, we saw clusters of young trees arranged unevenly, as well as many mountain rocks and mottled giant rocks scattered on both sides, some piled together, showing a rugged and prominent air. As I walked and looked around, I was overwhelmed with the sights. At noon, we had lunch in a cave of a certain high-ranking monk. After the meal, we chatted with the monk about cultivating oneself.

In the setting sun, with the evening breeze blowing, we regained our spirits and headed towards Yongquan Temple in the dusk. After walking along many winding stone steps, we reached a secluded path covered with fallen leaves. At this time, the setting sun was blocked by the towering mountain wall on the left, and all that was visible was the dense ancient pine trees, with the sound of waves constantly entering our ears with the evening breeze, making us feel the beauty of nature. After passing this secluded path, we reached the main road leading directly to Yongquan Temple. Without stopping, our footsteps quickly brought us to the mountain gate of Yongquan Temple.

At this time, the sky was already twilight, but our interest in sightseeing was still strong. We even strolled around Heshui Rock near the left side of the temple before returning to the Zen temple. In the hazy light, we followed the crowd through the side door of the temple, walked past the dark Heavenly King Hall corridor, and then entered a courtyard of about ten zhang square. In the center of the courtyard was a small pond, with two lightning rods, each more than ten zhang high, erected at both ends of the pond. Below were the words "Cast and donated by the colleagues of the Fuzhou Shipyard." The depth and firmness of the Min people's belief can be seen here. Passing through this courtyard, we reached the Daxiong Hall in the second courtyard. Next to the left side of this hall, there was a small door with the words "Guest Hall" written on it. Following this door was a corridor, with the guest hall and side rooms on the left, and a small rectangular courtyard on the right. Dozens of pots of chrysanthemums were arranged in the courtyard, trimmed very neatly. Many students were coming and going in the corridor, some wearing Zhongshan suits, others wearing sports clothes, hurrying back and forth, with singing, talking, and harmonica sounds mixed together, reminding me of dormitory life during my student days.

### Anli Wheel Repairs and Leaves Dock Soon to Sail Hong Kong-Macao Route Traffic Enters Dock for Repairs, Jiang Dai Hang Substitutes

The Dali and Anli wheels of the Si Yi (Four Counties) Steamship Company of this port, which used to run the Hong Kong-Jiangmen route, have been affected since ×× invaded Guangzhou, and all the river channels were blocked. The Dali wheel was stranded in Guangzhou and unable to return to Hong Kong. Only the Anli wheel remained in operation. Recently, it was docked for repairs. Now the wheel has been repaired and left the dock, and is moored at the Ping An Wharf. According to someone on board, the wheel will start running the Hong Kong-Macao route on the 15th of this month. As for the departure time, it is planned to depart for Macao at 8:00 AM every day and return to Hong Kong at 2:00 AM the next morning.

Also, the Traffic vessel of the Taisheng Company returned to Hong Kong from Macao yesterday morning and immediately entered the dock for repairs, which are expected to take about ten days. During the period when this wheel is being repaired, the Haojiang wheel will take its place.

### Fujian Provincial Transportation

Fuzhou Dispatch: The economic hub of Fujian Province has now shifted from the coast to the interior. In order to develop inter-provincial trade, the authorities have planned to organize joint transportation between Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi provinces. Joint transportation between Fujian and Zhejiang has already been implemented, with the Jiangpu section as the connection point, that is, from Jiangshan County in Zhejiang Province to Pucheng County in Fujian Province. The business is quite developed. Now, joint transportation between Fujian and Jiangxi will also be opened in the middle of this month, starting from Yanping in Fujian Province and ending in Nanchang in Jiangxi Province, with a direct bus service once a day. There is no need to change cars or tickets along the way, and it takes two days to arrive. If you take a steamboat from Fuzhou to Yanping, and then take a car from Yanping to Nanchang, it will take three days to arrive. The transportation is extremely convenient. Therefore, the Directorate General of Posts has recently been forwarding mail from foreign countries to Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces through Fuzhou, in order to expedite delivery. Currently, passenger transport is being handled first, and freight transport will be organized later. The road freight rates in this province are also cheaper than in other provinces. For example, the freight price for every 50 kilograms per kilometer is an average of 6 points in other provinces, while in Fujian Province it is only 4 points, or 3.5 points, or even 3 points. The freight for local products is as low as 2.5 points or 2 points, and the freight for grain is even lower, only 1.5 points per 50 kilograms per kilometer. In addition, the number of buses on the Fuzhou-Xinghua-Quanzhou line and the Yanping-Shaxian-Yongan line has been increased. The telephone line on the Yongchun-Dehua-Datian line has been completed. The roadbed and surface on the Yongan-Liancheng-Changting line have also been improved. The Yongan East Station and the car factory have both started construction. The station houses in Sanyuan and Xinkou, which belong to Sha, and Guangzhou and Hongtian, which belong to Liancheng, will be completed soon. In the past few months, the highway operating income of the whole province has increased to more than 180,000 yuan per month after rectification. Although the costs have increased (the price of gasoline has increased from one yuan and one quarter per gallon to one yuan and eight jiao and one point, and the price of tires has increased from 80 yuan per piece to 180 yuan), the Quanzhou-Xiamen highway, which has the most prosperous business, was broken down after the fall of Xiamen. The balance of income and expenditure still has a slight surplus, and the materials and oils have been fully stored, which is sufficient for use. In addition, Fuzhou's import and export trade has been booming recently. The main export goods are timber, fruits, paper, and sugar. The import goods are not only for the province's own use, but also transshipped to Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces. Foreign ships between Shanghai and Fuzhou have been very frequent recently. Most of the merchants engaged in import and export trade have made profits. It is expected that the business and finance markets will be stable during the upcoming lunar New Year.

### Returning from Changsha

— Lü Tongren

At this critical moment when the nation is in danger and the life of the race is being threatened, all young people with a bit of heart are stepping forward to fulfill their duties as citizens. Because of this, my little heart was finally stirred by the passion of national salvation. I ran back to Hong Kong from Saigon, Annam, alone. Because I was alone, I felt too lonely, so I found an old classmate, Mr. Li, in Hong Kong who shared my aspirations. Our goal was to go to northern Shaanxi to learn some knowledge about national salvation and to train ourselves to endure hardship. I ran away from home without saying goodbye. Mr. Li was in the same situation as me, but he was even more enthusiastic because he abandoned his studies to go. At first, we were hesitant because we couldn't solve the problem of travel expenses. After more than a month of fundraising, we finally scraped together a small sum of money, and we prepared to set off.

It was a morning on October 13, 1938. The weather was warm and the sky was lovely. We hurried, each carrying a leather bag of no particular size, to the pier where the boats to and from Guangdong and Hong Kong arrived, and boarded the Jinshan Wheel. At that time, the passengers were extremely crowded. Because we were a little late, we didn't even have a bed to sit or lie on. We had to lean against the side of the boat and stand. In an instant, the boat carried us away from the island of Hong Kong and sailed away. On this Jinshan boat, there were forty or fifty young men and women rescue workers returning from Burma. They were going to Hankou after arriving in Guangzhou, and then to the front line to serve. Their team included people from Guangdong, Fujian, Shanghai, and indigenous people from Burma. They all spoke in Mandarin or English. These forty or fifty rescue workers were all full of energy and courage. We talked to one of the team members, who said that they had all volunteered to return, all had considerable rescue knowledge, and were equipped with medicines and several private cars. After hearing what the team member said, we knew that they were very organized and deeply loved the country. It was just a few hours of sea voyage, and soon, at 1:00 PM that day, we arrived in Guangzhou. The rescue worker who had spoken to us knew that we were unfamiliar with the place and introduced us to a hotel in Guangzhou when we landed. Who knew that when we went there to look for it, the lodging house had already been destroyed by the ruthless bombing. We had no choice but to go to the South China Hotel in Shamian.

This was something we had not expected. The war was becoming so tense. That night when we arrived in Guangzhou, the transportation to and from Guangdong and Hong Kong was cut off, and Humen was blockaded. The situation was extremely chaotic. Guangzhou was a city I had never been to before. The sounds of air raid alarms and artillery were something I had never heard before. Although we were in this chaos, we were not alarmed at all. We were always determined to move forward and not retreat. The next day, there were no trains going to Hankou, so we stayed for three days in a row. During these three days, the planes came to bomb almost every day. It can be said that we were in air raid alarms all day long. At night, the whole city was pitch black, without a single light. At that time, the citizens were already moving away one after another, and there was almost no order on the streets. We were not afraid at all. We went out to find friends, buy necessities, and get a letter of introduction from the Eighth Route Army's office in Guangdong. Everything was very exciting. On the first day I arrived in Guangzhou, I could still see those energetic young men and women student soldiers. By the second or third day, the situation was different. These trained students had already left. Not a single one was seen. It was said that it was an order from the authorities. At this critical time when combat cadres were urgently needed, why did the authorities order them to leave first? To our shallow minds, it seemed wrong, but what the authorities' plans were, we could not know.

On the evening of the 16th, we were fortunate enough to catch a slow train to Hankou. Here, I would also like to say something about the danger and ridiculousness of our trip to catch the train. That night, two trains were running, one special express and one slow train. Because there were so many soldiers and passengers during this tense period, both the express and slow trains had almost no empty seats. Because we wanted to leave Guangzhou a little earlier, we wanted to take the special express train first, but there were no seats. What should we do? Some people went up to sit on the roof of the car. We followed them and climbed up. Later, the more we thought about it, the more inappropriate it seemed. We hurriedly climbed down in a panic. If you were on such a high roof, you would be frostbitten by the cold air, and it would be even more dangerous if the planes came to attack. The slow train was also full of people. In the crowd of people in a state of panic, our hearts were really anxious, like ants on a hot pot, not knowing what to do. Because if we missed the train that night, we didn't know when we would be able to go. Later, we found a person in the post office and said a lot of sincere words to him, and he allowed us to get on the train, giving us a small gap, so that we could barely sit down.

As soon as we boarded this Guangdong-Hankou train, we heard the people in the car speaking Mandarin. This is worth understanding. The train from Guangzhou to Hankou costs twelve yuan in national currency. Because we didn't have time to buy tickets at the ticket office, we bought tickets after boarding the train. Just as the sky was about to dawn, the air raid alarm sounded. At that time, the weather was already cold. In the dark wilderness, we quickly jumped out of the car and fled into the forest, but our luggage was left on the car. The air raid alarm was not lifted until dawn. We avoided countless air raids along the way. Sometimes, we didn't even drive for a whole day. Because we stopped to hide in the wilderness, we didn't even have a meal all day. The most difficult thing was for those women and children with delicate hands and feet, who had to follow us to climb mountains, cross ridges, and drill through trees. The car stopped for a few minutes at each stop, with guards waiting and hawkers selling food to the passengers. We passed through Qujiang, Lechang, Hengyang, and many smaller towns, which I can't remember. We also crossed more than a dozen mountain tunnels. Once the car went in, it was like driving at night, and we couldn't see any sunlight. Many of the tracks and bridges were destroyed by bombing, but workers were repairing them after the bombing, and there was no obstruction. Some passengers got off the train halfway, and some went straight to Changsha and Hankou, so it was not as crowded as when we first set out, and people felt much more comfortable. In this way, after three days and nights, we arrived in Changsha on the evening of the 19th.

### Current Situation of the Leather Industry in Hong Kong: Stable Market for Finished Leather, Sharp Decline in Raw Hide Exports

Leather is the raw material for manufacturing leather shoes. Although the annual production of raw cattle hides in our country is considerable, the manufacturing of finished leather has not yet mastered the proper techniques. Therefore, raw hides are exported on one hand, while finished leather is imported on the other. It is found that 90% of the finished leather in Hong Kong comes from Sydney, Australia, with Canada accounting for only one-tenth of the imports. Finished leather from Canada and Sydney is used for making Western shoe soles. It is said that citizens mostly favor Western shoes, so the annual trade volume is 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan, with 70% to 80% being consumed in this city and only 20% to 30% being sold to various parts of the country. Since the fall of Guangzhou, the domestic market has been further affected. Leather prices mostly fluctuate according to changes in exchange rates. Currently, the market price of Sydney leather is 50 to 60 yuan per picul (depending on the grade), high-grade leather is 100 to 120 yuan per piece, and extra-thick leather is 170 to 180 yuan per piece.

Pigskin is used for making shoe uppers, with an annual import value of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. Germany accounts for 80% of the production, and the remaining 20% comes from the United States. The price is 80 cents to 1 yuan per foot.

Red leather is used for making soles for Chinese-style shoes. The largest source is Pignon, accounting for almost two-thirds of the total. Singapore is next, accounting for one-third. Although there are sources from Siam, Haiphong, Annam, and other places, they are extremely rare. It is found that the annual trade value of red leather is over 2 million yuan, with 50% being sold to the mainland of Guangdong, and most of the rest being consumed by Hong Kong merchants, except for a small amount sold to Guangzhou Bay. Although there was some red leather manufacturing in the mainland last spring, it was only of a home-based handicraft nature, with very little production. The current market price of red leather can be generally divided into: 65 yuan per picul for high-grade, 50 yuan per picul for medium-grade, and 42 yuan per picul for low-grade (before July 7th, each picul was about 10 yuan lower). Currently, due to the inconvenience of transportation between Hong Kong and the mainland, the market situation is extremely bleak.

Raw hides are produced domestically, divided into yellow cattle hides and water buffalo hides. All of those exported from Hong Kong are produced in Guangdong and Guangxi, with an annual amount of 4 to 5 million yuan. The largest sales destinations are Japan and Germany, each accounting for almost 50% of the total. The markets in Britain, Italy, France, and the United States account for only a small portion. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has controlled imports, so the export of domestic raw hides has decreased by 50%. As a result, raw hide prices have also plummeted.

The current market price of raw hides is 60 to 70 yuan per picul for yellow cattle hides and 40 to 50 yuan per picul for water buffalo hides.

There are currently five or six leather factories (red and leather hides) in Hong Kong and Kowloon. They have adopted European and American methods and have achieved good results, with an annual output of 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. The raw materials mostly rely on raw hides from Guangdong and Guangxi because there is insufficient cattle slaughtering in Hong Kong to supply them.

### Who Does Not Desire Goodness as Much as I Do? Li Huitang Considers Going to Shanghai, But Hesitates Due to the Yunxia Incident

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Li Guiyong, a member of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, recently sent a letter to Zhou Shoushen, asking him to urge Li Huitang, who has been away from Shanghai for many years, to go north to participate in a charity football match to raise funds to benefit the disaster-stricken people.

The committee is jointly organized by Chinese and Western individuals in Shanghai. Shen Liang, the Director-General of the China National Amateur Athletic Federation, is also a member. Since its establishment, it has greatly benefited refugees. Currently, there are still over 100,000 refugees in Shanghai, and providing for them is a huge task that is not easy to manage. Therefore, it is planned to organize a charity football match and invite Li Huitang to go north to participate.

After receiving the letter, Zhou Shoushen immediately conveyed this intention to Li. However, Li was concerned about the suspension of the Hong Kong small football team's trip to Zhou last summer, and he did not dare to agree hastily. If he receives understanding from all parties and it is deemed feasible, he will not hesitate to travel north to appeal for the disaster-stricken people. The letters are recorded as follows:

Letter 1

Respectful greetings to Mr. Shoushen,

Your younger brother, in Chongqing Customs and traveling in Beiping, received your letter, which brought great joy. Since our last meeting, many seasons have passed, and my thoughts of you have never ceased. I hope you are well. The war has been going on for eighteen months, and the people in the disaster areas have been displaced. It is found that there are still over 100,000 refugees in Shanghai, and providing for them is a huge task that is not easy to manage. My colleagues and I plan to launch a charity football match to raise funds to provide assistance. We thought of Mr. Li Huitang, who is currently residing in Hong Kong. Mr. Li has long enjoyed a great reputation in the sports world and has been away from Shanghai for several years. The people of Shanghai miss him deeply. If he is willing to come to Shanghai to participate in the competition, the audience will surely rush to attend, and a large sum of money can be raised easily. Indeed, with Mr. Li's efforts alone, the lives of tens of thousands of people can be sustained, and his merits will be immeasurable. I have long admired your high moral character and great prestige. I specially write this letter to implore you to persuade him to participate in this charitable cause. Your favor will be deeply appreciated. I eagerly await your reply and wish you well.

Li Guiyong, respectfully, December 29th, 27th year,

Letter 2

Respectful greetings to Mr. Detang,

I received a letter from Mr. Li Guiyong of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, stating that there are currently over 100,000 refugees in Shanghai and that providing for them is a huge task. It is planned to launch a charity football match to raise funds. I am asked to persuade you to come to Shanghai to participate in the competition to increase the audience and contribute to the charitable cause. I have long admired your enthusiasm for charity and your willingness to do what is right. Therefore, I am writing this letter to you and enclosing the original letter for your reference. Please let me know your decision so that I can forward it to them. I wish you well.

Zhou Shoushen, respectfully, January 9th, 28th year

Letter 3

Respectful greetings to Elder Shoushen,

I have read your letter and the letter from the Shanghai International Relief Committee. I am deeply moved by the committee's concern for the disaster-stricken people and their intention to invite me to go north to participate in the charity football match. Everyone desires goodness as much as I do. During this sacred war of resistance, we in the sports world feel ashamed that we have not made a greater contribution to the country and society. If my participation can increase revenue and benefit the disaster-stricken people, I would be happy to do so. However, I recall that last year, a small football team from Hong Kong also planned to send a team to Shanghai to hold a Leader's Cup charity match to raise funds to aid the disaster-stricken compatriots. The purpose was noble and upright, but the trip did not materialize. This time, my personal trip north has the same meaning. I wonder if there will be any objections. In short, if the matter is for a good cause and the public agrees, then I will go through fire and water without hesitation, let alone the hardship of traveling. I am expressing my sincere thoughts and hope for your understanding. I wish you well.

Li Huitang, January 10th, 28th year

### Enthusiastic Participation in Charity Volleyball Tournament

The Hong Kong Reporters' Sports Special Committee has launched a charity volleyball tournament to appeal for the disaster-stricken people. The committee has already issued a notice and started registration. Various teams have shown great support for this charitable cause. The committee believes that it is the duty of all teams to participate in this competition. Therefore, it is planned to award a silver cup to the champion team upon the completion of the competition. However, according to reports, the teams have made suggestions, stating that this charity tournament is to appeal for the disaster-stricken people, and the outcome of the competition is not the main concern. Therefore, the award of the silver cup can be waived, so that the funds can be fully allocated to the disaster-stricken people. To respect the wishes of all teams, it is suggested that each team be presented with a certificate or a flag at the end of the competition as a memento, which is considered more appropriate.

### Meeting of the Academic Sports Association Tonight

### Nurses Association Launches Charity Volleyball Tournament

The Hong Kong Nurses Association believes that the soldiers fighting on the front lines are sacrificing themselves for the nation and are unfortunately injured, and they often lack medical supplies. In light of this, the association believes that the rear should do its best to support the front lines. Therefore, it has launched a charity volleyball tournament to raise funds to purchase medical supplies and transport them to the front lines. The association has already issued a circular to invite teams from Zhongda University and Lingnan University. After discussion, the two teams expressed their sympathy and agreed to send teams to participate in the competition, which is scheduled to be held at the Paul's College field at 3:30 PM next Saturday.

### Guangzhou Lianying Team in Hong Kong Appoints Officers

### One Match in Inter-School Table Tennis Tournament Tonight

The Yunlong Kowloon team will play its first match and defeated South China 5-0. Queen's College also defeated Fulin 5-0. Tonight's opponents are both strong, and there will be a fierce battle.

### One Match in Division C League Today

[Special dispatch from this newspaper] Today, there is one match in Division C (B): Airplane vs. University Hall, at 2:30 PM at the Football Association field. Airplane is the champion of this division and will definitely try their best to win.

### Three-School Volleyball Charity Tournament Raises Over 1,900 Yuan

The Lingnan Alumni Association, in conjunction with the Paul's College and Pui Ying Alumni Associations, held a volleyball charity tournament to raise funds for the China Youth Relief Corps. Yesterday, the Lingnan Alumni Association tallied the proceeds from ticket sales and volleyball raffles, totaling 2,185.77 yuan. After deducting expenses such as scaffolding, printing, tea, and miscellaneous items totaling 216.04 yuan, the net proceeds of 1,969.73 yuan were sent to the China Youth Relief Corps for disaster relief and fundraising expenses.

### Philippine Team to Come to Hong Kong for Match on Lunar New Year's Day; Hong Kong Team Will Fulfill Agreement to Visit Philippines After End of Football Season

The news of the Philippine team coming to Hong Kong to compete in football on Lunar New Year's Day has been circulating for some time. Although there has been no formal reply from the Philippine side, according to recent correspondence between the (Hong Kong-Philippine) organizers, the Philippine team's visit to Hong Kong is likely to happen.

According to the Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Regulations, there is a limit to the number of military players who can be selected. However, this Hong Kong-Philippine Interport match will not have this restriction. There are many good players in the army, navy, and air force stationed in Hong Kong, so the lineup will definitely be strong.

In the past, the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation has often spent large sums of money to invite foreign football teams to perform in the Philippines to learn from each other. The visit of the British Corinthian football team last May was particularly noteworthy. At that time, the Philippine team played very well against the same team, and their football skills improved compared to before. Two years ago, Hong Kong's Chinese-Austrian and strong Eastern teams visited the Philippines one after another, arousing a lot of football interest among the local people. Therefore, it is expected that the Philippine team will be able to come to Hong Kong in return.

When the Hong Kong Football Association invited the Philippine team to come to Hong Kong to compete, the Philippine side put forward the condition that if the team is invited to come to Hong Kong, the Hong Kong team must visit the Philippines after the end of the football season in April of this year. If this can be realized, then the Hong Kong team will inevitably have to go to the Philippines in the future. Therefore, it has been suggested that the Hong Kong Football Association should immediately notify all associations to recruit players who may be able to go to the Philippines, so as not to affect the expeditionary team due to the fact that the selected players cannot be released from Hong Kong temporarily.

### Three Women's Basketball Matches Tonight

[Special dispatch from this newspaper] The women's basketball tournament is nearing its championship decision.

Among the three strong teams, Huaqiao has failed twice and is declared hopeless. Therefore, the contest for the championship and runner-up will be between Meifang and Peidao only.

According to the schedule, there are three matches tonight, to be held at the YMCA gymnasium. The first match is at 6:30 PM, Southwest vs. Peidao. Southwest's fighting spirit is not bad, but compared to Peidao, there is a clear difference in strength. Peidao is a strong contender for the championship and will undoubtedly defeat Southwest.

The second match is at 7:30 PM, Huaqiao vs. Hong Kong University. Although Huaqiao is known as a strong team, its players are not evenly matched. Therefore, it was defeated by Peidao and Meifang one after another. However, its score is still good, and it will likely rank third. Tonight's match against Hong Kong University is sure to be a victory.

The last match is at 8:30 PM, South China vs. Paul's College. The Paul's College girls are still new to the game, and their strength is also inferior to South China. Therefore, South China should win two points. The players of each team are as follows:

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment...Wanderer of the Sea Corner

Algiers

The story takes place in a mysterious and strange place like those described in "Arabian Nights," called Algiers. Although it is now a French territory, one part of the city is quite modern, while the other part, inhabited by the natives, still completely retains the mysterious colors of ancient Orient. There, lawlessness prevails, and it is a gathering place for thieves and fugitives. The director has created a sinister and terrifying atmosphere in such a setting and has also woven a touching story. The insidious and brutal acts of the bandits fill every inch of film with mystery, horror, and strong stimulation.

The story tells of an international art thief who flees to this place. The betrayal of his accomplices and the pursuit of detectives are all outsmarted by him, but he succumbs to a charming French woman and loses his life.

Charles Boyer gives a very profound performance of the thief's character in this film. Hedy Lamarr, the female lead who starred in "Ecstasy," is also an excellent actress. Xue Liejia, in her first film, "The Adventures of Marco Polo," played the daughter of Kublai Khan and left us with a very good impression. In this film, she plays a native girl who passionately loves the thief, and her outstanding acting skills are worth our special appreciation.

Queen...Big-Mouth Woman Chases Sailor

Give Me A Sailor

Martha Raye and Bob Hope have had several successful collaborations in the past, and they give even more outstanding performances in this film, proving that they are a very suitable pair. The film is full of jokes and is an ideal work for audiences who watch movies for entertainment.

The story depicts the wild and debauched lives of some American sailors on leave. Among them, a pair of brothers-in-arms on the same ship create a lot of jokes because they chase the wrong love interest.

Martha Raye is the central figure of the film's humor. She plays a girl who is unloved but self-indulgent and maintains an excellent performance from beginning to end. Bob's strange facial expressions and his humorous and witty lines can be called unparalleled.

Also co-starring is Tigra Rabo, a beautiful and lively actress. She also has a clear and melodious singing voice. There are four new songs in the film, all recent works by famous musicians, and they are sung by the two of them, adding a lot of entertainment value to the film.

Peace...Arsenal Spy Gang

The Spy Ring

A spy film with little to recommend. The director has failed to fully develop the spies' activities and adventurous conspiracies. Moreover, the forced insertion of polo matches and some humorous scenes has cobbled together this incongruous film.

The story tells how a group of international spies are active in the United States, trying to steal the blueprints of a newly developed air defense weapon, but their cunning plot is finally thwarted due to the inventor's bravery and cleverness. The acting skills of all the actors are also very ordinary.

Orient...Arabian Storm

I Cover The War

An early war film depicting the Mesopotamian rebellion, with a romance inserted at the same time. If viewed with today's eyes, the few war scenes in it cannot be said to be successful. The protagonist is John Ford.

Dahua...Beauty Fades Easily

You're Only Young Once

A social film that is very enlightening for young people, giving young men and women powerful insights into love.

The story tells of a happy family whose head is a fair and wise judge. He has one son and one daughter. When his family travels in California, his children each enter a wrong path of complicated love affairs. He painstakingly rescues his children.

Although it is a very ordinary story, the director's skills are not weak, making it develop in a very fresh and lively way. In terms of actors, because of the proper arrangement, there are good performances, especially Louis Stone, who plays the judge, and his performance of understanding the psychology of young people's love is subtle.

Scenic Star...Treasure Island

Treasure Island

A film adapted from the famous book "Treasure Island." The main actors are Wallace Beery, Mack Brown, and Lionel Barrymore, and their performances are perfect.

Central...Great War Flying Guest

Galloping Ghost

A film produced by a small American company, Republic, with no artistic value. The entire film is designed to please the audience with slapstick fights and vulgar adventure scenes, just as the advertisement says, "the great contribution after 'Underwater Electric Country.'"

New World...Good Girl Marries Eighteen Times

Sequel

Cantonese film starring Yue'er

North River...Cantonese Opera

Taiping Men and Women Troupe

Daytime Performance - Blood Luo Freedom God, two volumes

Evening Performance - Pu Qinglang, Beautiful Woman, Soldiers

### Road

— Yu Ping

For the sake of the road, many people are troubled, especially young people in the great era. Although there are many revolutionary mentors who are instructing us, as Mr. Qi said, "Although there are many young people fighting and working on the front lines and in the rear, most young people still feel depressed and bewildered by ideological, political, and organizational problems, or feel that they have power but cannot use it, and that they have knowledge but cannot contribute."

It seems that there are many roads in front of us, and it seems that there are no roads at all. The problem is actually whether we have the determination and courage to run the road, and ability is secondary. In a word, it is still our petty-bourgeois consciousness that is at work. Originally, there is a broad road to travel, but we are confused by the bewilderment of wavering consciousness, and we become drowsy, from suspicion to not being able to see the road. But although we pessimistically and despairingly think that there is no road, the fact is that as long as we live for one day, we are still on the road, but this is not the road we idealize.

The world is neither as good as we imagine, nor as bad as we imagine. As long as you are willing to work hard, dare to face reality, and fight against life, there is a road. Mr. Lu Xun seems to have said this: "There was originally no road, but people stepped it out later." (meaning similar). We cannot return to our motherland, cannot go to the front line to kill ×, cannot go to the rear to mobilize the masses, cannot go to the occupied areas to fight guerrilla warfare, is there no road—? We must make a surprise attack and break a path out of nowhere. This is not impossible, life is originally a kind of struggle.

Everyone knows that we must observe things from the perspective of dynamic development, and at the same time, we must flexibly use correct theories. The problem of dealing with the road must also be handled in this way. Even if people can leave the environment, they should not succumb to the environment; the secret of dealing with the world lies in being able to adapt to the environment, use the environment, and then control the environment. To those friends who think they cannot find a road, this is also our secret to finding a road!

Life is a struggle! Take care!

### Starting with Goya

— Kai Qin

Because the Japanese "first-rate writer" Sato Haruo came to Shanghai to appreciate the post-war Zhabei, saying it was like seeing Goya's book, I was reminded of some current issues in painting.

In reality, if there were truly a painter like Goya today, it would be extremely necessary. Not to mention his already famous "The Disasters of War" and similar works, just his attitude towards painting would have a tremendous effect if he were here today. But that effect, needless to say, is not the peculiar taste pursued by Sato Haruo.

We can frankly say that China has never had a painter like this. Chinese national paintings were often just simple historical paintings, and even the highest achievements could only barely be compared to the French Rococo painter Watteau. But this is only a rough comparison. However, in the late Qing Dynasty, a great painter emerged, and that was Wu Jiayou, known as Youru.

This painter's name has long been forgotten, and recently, when people talked about "Shanghai Anecdotes," it was only mentioned incidentally. This is appropriate. Wu Youru's achievements, generally speaking, are twofold: first, he created true genre paintings; second, he created large-scale four-panel illustrations. Both of these are unprecedented in the history of Chinese painting. He not only brought painting into close relationship with current affairs but also used painting as a weapon to resist foreign aggression. I don't have "Dianshizhai Pictorial" or "Feiyingge Pictorial" at hand, but I remember that in his works, in addition to the descriptions of the major current events of the time, the Sino-French War, there were also protests against the concession courts. Of course, he never directly opposed the Qing court, and sometimes even praised it, and his realistic techniques were sometimes naive, but those should be attributed to his situation and his era.

In recent studies of Chinese painting (such as Mr. Yu Jianhua's "History of Chinese Painting"), there is almost no mention of Wu Youru. The reason why everyone prefers to remember Qian Hui'an, a painter who lived in Shanghai at the same time as Wu Youru and was also famous for painting figures, is because Qian is elegant, and Wu is vulgar. Of course, according to the theory of Chinese painting, Qian is qualified. But what does Qian paint? Just some ladies and gentlemen who have absolutely nothing to do with his surroundings (which is fundamentally different from Wu's historical records). Elegance is certainly good, but I think the most thorough elegance is still Mi Fu's landscape paintings, where he uses the brush to arbitrarily dot around, without any "craftsman's touch" at all, but what is the use of that, no one can say.

I am not saying that current painters must learn from Wu Youru; I am just saying that a painter like Wu Youru is still needed today. Current painters need to pay attention to his attitude, his planning, and his subject matter. If there could be a painter now who could run a pictorial like Wu Youru, I think it would still be useful. Of course, for real news, there is now photography, but like Wu Youru, extracting the essence of current events, depicting the real characters of pursuit and satire, and even adding a popular explanation at the end, as Wu Youru did, would still be extremely meaningful. As for the technique needing to be more advanced and to be melted into new techniques, that goes without saying.

There are still art schools in Shanghai now. But I don't know what the courses are like at all. However, judging from the usual "art style," it is certainly impossible to go to the countryside for sketching now, but probably everyone is still in the room, lighting a fire, drawing a model of the body, and the people who are copied are probably still Raphael's Madonna and the like. As basic courses, it cannot be said that these should not be learned. But at present, I think that since there is time to use Western works of the past to hone art, it would be much more beneficial to copy Goya's works than to copy Raphael's, and it would not be wrong to learn from works like Daumier and Toulouse-Lautrec. These are just two painters that I thought of at random. Applying that kind of art to the present is certainly not enough, but if that kind of method were to be developed, it could at least expose the decay of a certain part of this painting, and at least it could vividly depict the original shape of the good and the bad. However, these two painters are also rumored in the West to be painters with a "craftsman's touch," and their names are often not mentioned in art history.

### On the Massacre in Jiading

— Yang Baozheng

—A Reportage on the People's Resistance to the Qing Dynasty in the Late Ming Dynasty—

"A Record of the Massacre in Jiading," originally named "Dongtang Diary," also known as "Jiading 'Youji Lue'," is a book recording how the people of Jiading resisted the war in the late Ming Dynasty. The author, Mr. Zhu Zisu, was personally present and what he recorded was of course very close to the truth. In the late Ming Dynasty, Wu Sangui led the Qing troops south. Traitorous officials surrendered to him. After Yangzhou was captured, the people who were still holding out and resisting the war included Jiangyin, Kunshan, Jiading, Songjiang and Jinshanwei. The resistance in Yangzhou, Jiading and Jiangyin was the most fervent and tragic. And the massacres were also the most severe. There was a saying at the time, "It's bitterer than Jiading, it's more tragic than Jiangyin!" The painful situation at the time can be imagined!

"Dongtang Diary" is a real-time record of that time, and it is a first-class reportage literature of national consciousness. The author, Mr. Zhu Zisu, whose courtesy name was Jiuchu, was a supplementary county student. He was assigned to the Ministry of Rites in the year of Jia Shen, but he gave up the position and lived in seclusion as a professor. He was of course a man of integrity. He also edited "Records of Loyal Subjects of Past Dynasties" and "Brief Records of Mourning for Loyal and Upright Officials," which were all full of national consciousness. The works describing the national resistance in Jiading that Mr. Zhu left behind are of course also full of national consciousness. As far as I know, there are now six published versions of this book:

(1) Jingtuo General Edition
(2) Unofficial History of the Late Ming Dynasty Edition
(3) Records Compilation Edition
(4) Shenbao Press Typeset Edition
(5) Series on Internal Strife and Foreign Disasters in China Edition
(6) Muqing Jiazi Huitang Zhu Chunsheng Manuscript Edition

The Zhu Chunsheng manuscript is originally named "Dongtang Diary," with a summary by Zhu Jiuchu in the front and a postscript by Zhu Chunsheng on the 23rd night of the first month of Jiazi in the back. It is now hidden at Zhou Chengzhong's place in Jiading, and it was once typeset and published. The original was exhibited at the Shanghai Literature Exhibition held in the Shanghai Museum. Comparing this book with the previous published versions, it is known that the previous published versions have all been tampered with by people in the Qing Dynasty, losing their original appearance—but this manuscript is Mr. Zhu Zisu's original manuscript.

This manuscript calls the people's "righteous soldiers" "our army" and the "Qing soldiers" "Northern soldiers." All the newly appointed dignitaries of the Qing court are also called "Northern" without the prefix "Qing." And many published versions call them "Great Qing" and "Qing soldiers," and call "Prince Yu" "Grand General of the Manchu Army," which is certainly not the work of Mr. Zhu Zisu, who had national consciousness. This manuscript criticizes the then magistrate of Jiading, saying that Magistrate Qian Mo "did not care about his official position, and people had no laws to follow." and the Japanese have deleted it—as evidenced by Jiading's "Shangzhai Jianwenlu," which also says:

"The new magistrate of Jiading is Qian Mo from Jiashan, Zhejiang, who is not well-known. His name is Mo, and he was a jinshi in the same class as the former Magistrate Cao. While in office, he became a son of a noodle shop owner. He was young and known for his talent, but when he became a government official, he specialized in exploitation, and the people were full of complaints!"

At that time, Magistrate Qian Mo was indeed a public gangster who exploited the people, but the published version deleted his crimes and hid his sins!

This manuscript calls Jiang Ruolai at that time, a truly loyal and virtuous man, saying "When the Northern soldiers entered the south, Ruolai fled back, killed his wife and children, and entered the sea to rely on Prince Yiyang." He killed his wife and then escaped to the sea. How upright he was! But the published version calls Ruolai "a rascal in the market who was promoted to an official by his strength, and fled his post when he heard that Weiyang was captured." Jiang Ruolai was actually a negligent rascal! This manuscript says that Ruolai "looked at the dozens of copper guns in the warehouse and ordered people to carry them away, and then entered the sea from Xujiakou." He took away the important weapons that Jiading had to avoid encountering the enemy. This kind of retreat was the most necessary, but the published version changed it again, saying that Ruolai "hurriedly went to the market, leaving only dozens of thousands of copper coins, carried them away, and looted greatly after passing through Xujia, leaving nothing behind, and the farmers' cries shook the sky." Jiang Ruolai was actually a bandit! The Qing Dynasty people's ability to tamper with things was really clever, changing "dozens of copper guns" into thousands of copper coins, and changing "then entered the sea from Xujiakou" into "returned to Xujia to rob greatly." This change was not enough to make sense, so they added the sentence "leaving nothing behind, the poor people cried in the open air!"

Also, when the righteous soldiers of the outer Weigang fought fiercely with Liang Desheng, Jiang Bing won a great victory. The manuscript describes it in great detail:

"At that time, our army was almost defeated, but the soldiers from Weigang and Loutang joined the battle with great force. Zou Su was known as a bandit. He was brave and dared to fight. He killed the blacksmith. In a few moments, soldiers from all the villages gathered in a crowd, competing to burn Liang Desheng's ships, and Li Chengxie burned all the fine gold, beautiful jewels, famous swords, and precious sabers he had obtained from Weiyang, Jinling, Kunling, and Jingkou, and all that had not been destroyed was looted by the villagers. Many women were carried in the ships and were burned miserably. Among them was a woman who was most beautiful, who shouted, 'I am the daughter of a Hanlin official, and my home is in Yangzhou. I was captured here. Please save me!' The villagers all said, 'Jump into the water!' The woman cried, 'My feet are locked and I can't escape!' Before she could finish her words, the raging fire burned her feet! The smoke covered the sky, and the red light shone for more than ten miles. It did not die out until dawn. Desheng fled east at night, escaping in a sorry state."

How brave and valiant the righteous soldiers' attack and arson were! The people of the Weigang area are still very tough to this day. Ordinary bandits, when the great era comes, stand up and become heroes of righteousness and courage. Ancient and modern times are the same, but the published version, which has been tampered with by the Qing people, only says a few words: "At dawn, Desheng's soldiers' heads were captured, a total of eighty. Desheng's remaining men fled east, escaping in a sorry state."

During the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, there were countless places where the Qing people tampered with and manipulated the truth in works of national consciousness. This "Record of the Massacre in Jiading" is also an example.

### The Distance Between Two Eras

— Meng Qi

Once, a letter said that even in the countryside, the consultation fee was still too expensive, and it was not effective, so he was taking "immortal prescriptions." Although my father had limited scientific knowledge, he was usually extremely opposed to superstition. My mother was also a very sensible woman. To not take medicine and instead take "immortal prescriptions" was only to save money. Perhaps my father's illness was delayed because of this, which is another thing that I will regret for the rest of my life!

My father truly carried on his fatherly duties to me. When I was still studying in the second year of university, the family's economic situation was unable to support my tuition due to a sudden change in circumstances. (The cost of that school was the second highest in the country.) But he always tried every means to make me continue my studies happily, and he never wanted me to know about the difficult situation. I remember that at that time, there were many miscellaneous expenses in the school. Whenever others paid, he always tried his best to find a way to give it to me. At that time, I didn't know anything. Later, when I asked him, he said that it wasn't for the sake of saving his own face, but rather to avoid spoiling the self-esteem of young people. I also remember that one year, my father's expression seemed very uneasy during the day on New Year's Eve, but when he lit the big candles to worship the ancestors in the evening, my father regained his gentle expression, persuaded us to drink, and told jokes that were difficult but not very funny. Later, my father and mother and I "bid farewell to the old year." He took out the New Year's money for me with a bright expression, saying, "Buy something you like." I was only a teenager at the time, and I could vaguely "read faces and discern colors," and I could see that my father must have some secret worries. I asked my mother repeatedly, and my mother slowly told me that it was because he didn't have the New Year's money. My father hesitated for a long time, and finally took his beloved jade Ruyi out to "pawn" it. The next day, on "the first day of the New Year," my father's most beloved jade Ruyi was indeed gone from the altar. I was so moved by this that I cried several times. (To be continued)

### Our Work in Wengyuan

— Man Lei

After we left Guangzhou, we arrived in Wengyuan, located on the border of the Beijiang River in northern Guangdong.

Wengyuan is an important and abundant county in the Beijiang River area. The mountains are very steep, and there are roads everywhere that lead directly to the northeast Beijiang area. Obviously, it is a remote and poor place, but there are very vast fields here, and the villagers all make a living by farming. There are also several primary schools and important institutions in the county; there is also a poor relief center. However, after the unprecedented bombing by × people's planes for two or three days on October 15th and 16th, nine out of ten shops in the city were empty, and the entire city of Wengyuan and the small market town became a field of rubble. Our working group lived near Huangtang Township, outside Wengyuan City, no more than a stone's throw from Wengyuan City. The × planes bombed mercilessly day after day, and the villagers fled in droves. There are many ancestral halls and dilapidated houses standing here, with many words such as "Yingsu Residence," "Daifu Residence," and "Zhifeng Residence" engraved outside the ancestral hall doors, as if embellishing the collapsed palaces of ancient Egyptian birds. From this, it can be inferred that many ancestral halls have a long history. Our bedrooms are very simple, tidy, and clean. We bought dry straw for a small amount of money from the villagers and spread it on the ground, and we could sleep soundly.

We have several symposiums, small group meetings, discussion meetings, review meetings, etc. every week. Sometimes, the team leader had us practice night marches and guerrilla tactics. During the day, we set out to work. Whenever we arrived at a small village or market town, we would gather a group of villagers and explain the importance of the people saving the country, or we would take advantage of the days when the market was held. Taking advantage of this crowded place, we would start individual conversations with them, or use the method of family visits, using the simplest and most popular tone to explain to them the madness of the × people's bombing and expose the unscrupulous activities of the traitors. The work we launched with the villagers of Qingxian County focused on propaganda, text, pictures, singing, drama, and other work. Although some of them were illiterate or villagers with shallow knowledge, they never understood the meaning of resisting the war and saving the country. However, they were very sympathetic and enthusiastic about the wounded and rescued on the battlefield.

The noteworthy things about our work in the past two months are probably the following: (1) Actively promote the people in various townships and districts, organize the people, and train the people to participate in the patriotic groups and self-defense groups to protect their homes and defend the country. (2) Contact the Baotjia chiefs of various townships and districts; Unite with the villagers in five phases, (3) Find the target of the work center, (4) Make the words popular and simple so that they can understand them. The above four points are indispensable prerequisites for today's people's movement work. Young people who are interested in the people's movement today should pay more attention to this aspect.
