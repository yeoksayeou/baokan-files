### Developing Guerrilla Zones and Winning Over Puppet Troops

The war reports from various districts these past few days indicate that the second phase of the War of Resistance is quickly approaching full-scale development. The Japanese troops in North and South China, after three or four months of redeployment, are beginning to stir on a large scale; the Japanese troops in Central China are also preparing for a general offensive. The Japanese troops north of the Yangtze River are attempting to advance on Yuejing [Nanjing] and then press on Xiangfan. The Japanese troops in the areas that have fallen under occupation are launching what they call "cleanup campaigns." All this indicates that the Japanese troops are using military steps of disturbance in all directions to select the target of their general offensive, attempting to gamble on a single throw of the dice. The cry that "a major battle is about to break out" is not without foundation!

However, from the observation of the war situation in the north and south within three weeks since the beginning of the new year, the shortcomings and difficulties that the Japanese side will inevitably encounter and exacerbate in this new offensive have been constantly exposed. For example, in this "Shanxi general offensive," although the Japanese troops have changed to a new strategy targeting our mobile warfare, their forces still cannot avoid being dispersed, and their morale is declining day by day. This is the main reason for this failure. In the Guangdong battles, although the Japanese troops adopted a two-pronged offensive from the northwest, they could not avoid using a considerable amount of force in the eastern region at the same time. As a result, the western route became a bandit-like harassment with no progress, and the main force on the northern route suffered significant damage under the attack of our powerful army. Why did the Japanese troops encounter such setbacks in this probing general offensive? First, because the Japanese troops' offensive spirit and combat power have been gradually worn down, weakened, and even eliminated in the past eighteen months of war. On the contrary, the eagerness to avoid war and the prevalence of anti-war ideas are increasing. According to a Central News Agency report from Huaiyin on the 23rd, more than 500 Japanese troops in Jiangyin suddenly mutinied, and the Japanese commander was shot. They also engaged in extensive burning, killing, and looting, which is a fresh and ironclad proof. Second, it is due to the wavering and rebellion of the puppet troops under the control of the Japanese army and the large-scale defection to our army with weapons. As a result, the attacking spirit of the Japanese army has become more and more weak, and the combat power has become more and more weakened. These examples are too numerous to mention. A special dispatch from Guilin in this newspaper on the 20th stated that the puppet guerrillas in Dangtu shot their officers and all surrendered to the New Fourth Army. A Central News Agency report from Xi'an on the 22nd stated that the puppet police in Lingqiu defected entirely on the 13th. Reports in various newspapers on the 24th stated that the puppet troops in the Northeast were brewing a continuous rebellion and joining forces with the volunteer army and the Eighth Route Army that had penetrated into Jehol [Rehe] to resist Japan. These are all recent facts. Third, it is due to the importance attached to guerrilla warfare by our highest authorities. In addition to clearly stipulating that "guerrilla warfare is more important than positional warfare" as the main guideline for the second phase of the War of Resistance, special war zone commanders have been appointed successively to direct the War of Resistance behind enemy lines, and war zone party and government committees have been established. The guerrilla warfare in Suiyuan, Chahar, Jehol, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang and other places has seen significant development, creating major difficulties for the Japanese army's offensive, and even becoming a fatal blow to the Japanese army's offensive!

All these new features of the recent war between us and the Japanese demonstrate two points: First, the Japanese army is beginning its larger offensive steps, but the Japanese army has many difficulties, especially the increasingly obvious decline in the offensive spirit in the offensive, the weakening of combat power, the successive defections of the puppet troops, and the seriousness of the chaotic situation in the rear. Second, if we can make greater efforts to develop the guerrilla zones and win over the rebellion and defection of the Japanese and puppet troops, the Japanese army will face even more serious difficulties, which will not only strongly hinder their new offensive but also ruthlessly force them to abandon the offensive and try to conserve their strength.

From the above analysis, we can assert that during the second phase of the War of Resistance, the Japanese offensive will be more crazy, adventurous, cruel, and fierce. However, we still have methods and power to stop the Japanese offensive. The most important thing is to develop the guerrilla zones and win over the Japanese and puppet troops. Regarding the former, we must make greater efforts to unite all anti-Japanese forces in the areas behind enemy lines, establish, consolidate, and develop all anti-Japanese political power and armies, intensify the political work among the military and civilians behind enemy lines, unify the command of guerrilla warfare, promote democratic politics in the guerrilla zones, revitalize the military discipline in the guerrilla zones, and destroy the Japanese and puppet regimes in the guerrilla zones. At the same time, we must organize larger-scale guerrilla zone advance corps and train hundreds of thousands of strong political work cadres to continuously reinforce the guerrilla zones in the north and south! Regarding the latter, we must make greater efforts to expand the political work against the Japanese and puppet troops, and even send firm, capable, and strong cadres to infiltrate the Japanese and puppet troops, enhance the national self-esteem and self-confidence of the puppet troops, and promote the realization and determination of the Japanese officers and soldiers against the fascist military阀. Organize a larger-scale movement of avoiding battle, refusing to fire, anti-war, and even group defection and mutiny among the Japanese and puppet troops during the offensive. However, to carry out these two great struggles, first, we must insist on national unity to resist Japan to the end, and second, we must fully guarantee political progress. For all conspiracies of provocation, alienation, and division, etc., that use the smoke screen of "anti-communism" and "peace," no matter whether they come from Japan or originate internally, they should be ruthlessly attacked and thoroughly eliminated.

### Vice Chairman Feng's Speech on Sino-Soviet Relations: Many Democratic Countries Offer Assistance, but the Soviet Union Exerts the Greatest Effort

[Chengdu Dispatch] At 3:00 PM on the 5th, the Chengdu branch of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association specially invited Mr. Feng Huanzhang, the honorary president of the association, to give a speech in the auditorium of the Youth Association. About five to six hundred representatives from various agencies, organizations, and newspapers attended. Unfortunately, the venue was too small, and many people had to stand outside the door until the meeting ended. First, Chairman Deng Junchun explained that the welcome to Mr. Feng was not only because he was the honorary president of the association, but also because Mr. Feng's hard work and dedication were respected by the whole country. Therefore, with this grand admiration, we specially welcome and pay tribute to Mr. Feng. Mr. Feng then stepped onto the platform amid warm applause. Mr. Feng's entire talk was cordial, powerful, and full of scholarly interest. Therefore, Mr. Feng received a lot of applause and laughter during his speech. The following is a brief record of Mr. Feng's speech for the readers:

"I dare not accept the welcome, but I am very honored to meet with you all. First, let me talk about two things. First, I was sent to various places by the National Government, so first, let me extend greetings to you on behalf of the National Government. Second, when I was about to depart, I was entrusted by the Supreme Leader to extend his greetings to the elders and brothers of the whole country. Regarding Sino-Soviet relations, the Soviet Union is our good friend. This is not only because Premier Sun Yat-sen once established a pro-Soviet policy, but also because the Soviet Union's spirit of hard work can serve as a good example for us and can give us great encouragement. At present, we have launched a struggle to resist our enemy—Japanese imperialism. On the one hand, of course, we rely on our own efforts, and on the other hand, the history of the Soviet Union's hard revolutionary struggle has served as our precedent.

Our War of Resistance naturally depends entirely on our own strength, but we also extremely and fully welcome the help of friends. The Soviet Union, this friend, has really helped us a lot, especially when the invading Japanese are like mad dogs, their assistance is even more valuable. Since the War of Resistance, various democratic countries have naturally helped us a lot, but the Soviet Union has exerted the greatest effort. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said that help is not just empty words, but should be facts.

Let's talk about the War of Resistance. Now Japan is getting worse and worse, and we are getting better and better. There are many facts to prove this. I met General Li here. He said that before, the soldiers on the front line were afraid of fighting. They would only fight when the Japanese came, and if they didn't come, they wouldn't fight. But now, the soldiers are not afraid. If the Japanese don't come, we will fight them anyway. We are really getting tougher and tougher. I think Sichuan has made a lot of progress. Many excellent cadres are military academy students in their early twenties, and the general laborers are strong and brave, just like they are raised by one mother. When asked why they joined the army, their answer is "for the country," and then they say "for our ancestors, for our descendants, and for ourselves to have a good life." In the past, they could only vaguely answer that it was to "protect the country and defend the people," but now they have truly understood and truly progressed.

In Shanghai, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Jinan, Beiping, and the entire Japanese-occupied rear area, our army is constantly waging war against the Japanese, making the Japanese rear area also become the front line. They simply cannot cope and have difficulty maintaining control. This good phenomenon is the result of the cooperation between our trained army and the people. In the past, the army did not go behind enemy lines, but now it is essential to intensify the anti-Japanese work behind enemy lines. The Chairman of Hebei Province, Lu Zhonglin, has now established a provincial government in Hebei. There are sixty-four counties, all of which are still our territory. The Japanese have no power to intervene. Therefore, at present, our troops are very willing to work behind enemy lines. The Japanese army behind enemy lines has reached a point where it cannot support the current situation. If we persevere in a protracted war, the final victory is absolutely not a problem. I believe that the meaning of protracted war is like water dripping on stone, sawing a tree in half, or termites attacking a tree. Although it may not be very effective in the short term, the result will be successful. However, this kind of success requires our own efforts and we cannot just sit and wait, like opium addicts who only care about smoking opium or gamblers who only know how to play cards. If we can work hard, we can say that if we work hard enough, we can defeat Japan in just one year. If we work twenty times harder, it will only take six months. If we work forty times harder, it will only take three months. In short, the harder we work, the faster victory will come.

Here, I believe that the contributions of the members of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association are: (1) translate more Soviet works, whether military, political, economic, or literary, and do not just translate a few articles in newspapers. Attention should be paid to public propaganda, compiling ballads, etc., to spread among the people; (2) translate our heroic deeds since the War of Resistance into Russian, so that foreigners can understand our efforts and give us greater assistance. For example, the anti-Japanese deeds of Ge Haowen, once translated into foreign languages, were extensively reported even by Japanese newspapers, acknowledging the bravery of our army and admiring the great spirit of our army in serving the country.

Finally, I have good news to tell you all. In the past, the professors in our military academies were all Japanese and German. Now, we welcome the Soviets. The Soviet Union is our friendly country and has sent many military experts to train our new army. This is something that we should be happy about. I hope everyone can work hard with peace of mind, and the future is absolutely optimistic."

### Under the Double Oppression of the Japanese and Puppets, the People of Wuhu Suffer Unspeakable Hardship (Part 1): Major and Minor Traitors Run Rampant, Controlled by Us Five Miles from the City

[Wuhu Correspondence] Wuhu is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River, upstream from Nanjing, and is the only large commercial port in Anhui Province. Major native products from southern and central Anhui, such as rice, tea, silk, and eggs, are exported from here. Imported goods such as silk, satin, oil, sugar, and foreign goods are also transferred to the interior from here. The city is prosperous, with a population of about 200,000. The important trunk roads in the city, such as Zhongshan Road, Beiping Road, Erjie, and Siming Road, have been widened and rebuilt and have become modern roads. The highways include the Jingwu Line, the Wutun Line (Wuhu to Tunxi), and the Wuwu Line (Wuhu across the river to Wuwei County). The railways include the Jingsun Line of the Jiangnan Railway (from Jing [Nanjing] to Sunjiabu in Yicheng) and the Yuhe Line of the Huainan Railway (Yuhan [from Wuhu across the river] to Hefei). Various Yangtze River shipping companies have wharf terminals and warehouses in Wuhu. Water and land transportation is very convenient. At the beginning of the August 13th War of Resistance, many people along the Jinghu Line fled to Wuhu, so the population increased and the market was prosperous before the city fell. When Guangde fell and Yicheng was suddenly bombed, the people of Wuhu were greatly panicked. Then Wuhu was also bombed, and the people fled everywhere, which was extremely tragic. The Administrative Commissioner's Office withdrew to Wuwei County. Then, the vanguard of the Japanese army arrived in Wuhu from Gaochun, Jiangsu, via Shuiyang Island Creek (under the jurisdiction of Dangtu County), and carried out large-scale burning, looting, raping, and killing. The brutal acts were countless. Later, corrupt officials, corrupt merchants, local ruffians, and hooligans established the so-called "Autonomous Committee" under the instigation of the Japanese comfort squad. The puppet chairman was Zhu Feng, and the puppet committee members were Wang Mengshou, Yu Shuoping, Xie Xuelin, Wang Zidong, Wang Xiaofu, Wang Shancheng, Wei Minqiang, Song Jiemi, Li Huinong, etc. The puppet committee members believed that the place was full of scars and the population could be used. Therefore, they begged the Japanese side to allow them to sell the salt stored in the warehouse by the salt merchants, the rice accumulated in the locality, and the goods of the unmanned shops in the whole port (to be continued)

### Major Battles in Guangdong, Shanxi, and Hubei Expected, Local Contacts Continue Fiercely, Fighting on the Border of Hebei and Chahar Continues for Days

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing to this newspaper on the 20th] As of last night: The situation in various places was generally quiet, with no major battles, but local contacts were still fierce. According to the Japanese troop deployments, they are still planning to intrude into Guangdong, Shanxi, and Hubei. Our front-line deployment is on high alert to prevent them.

[Special Dispatch from Xi'an to this newspaper on the 24th] The Japanese troops violating the Great Wall Line in western Shanxi have been repelled. There are still contacts near Hejin, Jixian, and Quwo. Fighting has also been taking place on the border between Hebei and Chahar for days.

[Central News Agency Report from the 23rd] There have been fierce battles in Huaiyuan County, eastern Suiyuan, for days. Casualties on both sides have been heavy. The PingSui train is not running, which is the reason. Two trains of Japanese troops and dozens of cannons were dispatched from Datong, reportedly specifically to deal with our guerrillas.

[Associated Press Report from Chongqing on the 24th] A seesaw battle is currently taking place in western Suiyuan and Xining (Xia), that is, Dengkou, one hundred miles north of Ningxia's tax city. There are also battles in which both sides have been fought for 24 hours. The Chinese army finally recovered Dengkou on the 23rd of this month. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. In addition, the distant and slow-moving Chinese army attacked Ren Guihua on the 21st of this month. One Japanese soldier was killed and seven were captured. The southern suburbs of Baotou are also at war.

[Minge Society JingLe Report on the 24th] Japanese officers and soldiers in northern Shanxi have been wearing white armbands recently. It is rumored that the leaders of the Japanese puppet government were assassinated by anti-war youths. In Datong, Taiyuan, and other important towns, the price of puppet currency is falling daily. Japanese officers, soldiers, and traitors are vying to exchange puppet currency for our provincial currency and French currency. The city of Taiyuan is empty, and the market is maintained by puppet soldiers. Armored vehicles patrol the suburbs day and night to prevent our army from attacking.

[Minge Society JingLe Report on the 24th] The Japanese near Yuanping recently forcibly occupied many houses in the villages of Shen Shantouzhuang and other villages in the west, claiming that they will attack Wangjiazhuang. There has also been an increase in Japanese troops stationed in Chen, but there has been no action. There are more than 300 Japanese troops in Ningxian, and more than 1,000 Japanese troops in the Taihelingkou area, with no changes.

[Minge Society Xingji Report on the 24th] Our unit recently destroyed about two miles of the Pinghan Railway north of Shaoshi, and recovered more than 1,000 catties of power lines along the line. The Pinghan train has not been running for several days. Another unit destroyed several sections of the Zhengtai Railway east of Jingxing, recovered 500 catties of power lines, and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese for over an hour, killing more than 20 Japanese soldiers. In addition, the Jinpu Railway near Dezhou has recently been heavily damaged by our guerrillas.

[Minge Society Xingji Report on the 24th] Shelling has been fierce near Houma in recent days. More than 3,000 Japanese troops and 17 aircraft have gathered in Yuncheng. The Japanese claim that they will attack Zhongtiao Mountain. The Japanese troops spying to the west will return to Houma to provide support, attempting to break through. There are more than 1,000 Japanese troops in Jiexian. Recently, more than 1,000 laborers have been conscripted to repair roads 20 miles away, and have now been repaired to Qiliping. A large number of Japanese troops in Hejin have transported to Yuncheng. Only more than 300 remnant troops are left near Jiangxian.

[Central News Agency Changde Report on the 24th] The highway from Shashi to Zao City to Jingshan has been thoroughly destroyed by us. The Japanese have recently forced our laborers to repair the road, and the people along the way are all deeply saddened.

### Naval Battle Unfolds in Beihai, Tensions Suddenly Rise in Western Guangdong

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing to this newspaper on the 24th] According to reports, our guerrillas in the suburbs of Guangzhou and on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway are constantly engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese army. Our coastal defenses in southern Guangdong have been strengthened and there is no cause for concern.

[Foreign News from Hong Kong on the 24th] Japan's offensive in South China may have new developments recently, as the Japanese side has decided to attempt to invade Guangxi along the Xijiang River and the Beihai area. According to reliable news this morning, the Chinese land artillery positions in Beihai have already been fighting with the Japanese warships anchored between Enzhou and Beihai. The Chinese side has greatly strengthened the coastal defense works, and the Japanese air force activities have also increased compared to before. The strength of the Japanese army encircling Guangzhou has also been substantially increased. It is said that these troops have all been transferred from the north and are now moving towards the Xijiang River. It is also reported that the elite troops of the Japanese army invading along the Yuehan Railway have been specially withdrawn and transferred to the Xijiang River area.

[Macau Report on the 20th] A yet unconfirmed message was received here last night, stating that several Chinese aircraft from Guilin flew to Beihai and Weizhou yesterday and bombed the Japanese fleet anchored there. Several Japanese ships, including a transport ship, were hit, and the losses were extremely large. There have been no changes in the situation in Beihai, Weizhou, and Hainan Island. Part of the Japanese army has landed on Enzhou Island.

(News from Hong Kong) A Westerner who arrived in Hong Kong from Beihai yesterday said that the situation in Beihai is very serious. The population has been evacuated, and the stores only open at night. However, it is very deserted, and the desolation is unprecedented. Recently, Japanese warships have been concentrated on Guozhou Island and Hainan Island. Yesterday, two 10,000-ton Japanese cruisers and a large aircraft carrier passed through the Hainan Strait. It seems that the Japanese army has Weizhou Island as its base, and every day they are seen flying into the interior through Beihai. Yesterday, a team of Japanese aircraft flew low along the coast of Beihai and strafed the residents on the water with machine guns. Yesterday, Saturday and Sunday, two Japanese armed fishing boats entered the Huahai port and then drove out without firing. Most of the stores in Beihai are now closed, and the people are taking down their doors and utensils and moving them inland to avoid providing resources to the Japanese army. There are many troops in the city, singing anti-Japanese patriotic songs in the evening and practicing shooting during the day. The atmosphere is very strong, and they are now ready for battle. Chaoan and other places were bombed.

### Air Raids in Various Places, Chaoan and Other Places Bombed

[Shantou Report on the 24th] Japanese warships and aircraft have not been active here for a long time. Since yesterday, a Japanese cruiser anchored near Nanao and an aircraft have been bombing Lake An and Jieyang. The Xiangzi Bridge in Chaoan City was destroyed by bombing, and the long-distance bus station in Jieyang was bombed. The Japanese aircraft flew over Shantou four times on that day but did not bomb. When the Japanese aircraft bombed the Chaojie bus station on Sunday morning, machine gun fire was heard, injuring two people.

[Central News Agency Nanyang Report on the 24th] At 10:00 AM on the 23rd, six Japanese aircraft were spotted in Fangcheng Mountain. At 11:00 AM, they invaded Henan Province, and Nanyang issued an alert. They immediately invaded the sky and flew low over the area and bombed in the area of Zhaocheng and opened fire with machine guns. At the same time, ten Japanese aircraft invaded in batches and wantonly bombed the South Gate and North Gate in the city. Machine guns and bombs bombed each other, destroying more than 20 houses and killing or injuring 25 people. Wu Guoshun, a worker at the Minguo Daily, was injured by shrapnel, and Sun Chisheng was crushed to death. At 12:00 PM, the Japanese aircraft fled eastward.

[News from Hong Kong] This newspaper received a dispatch from Dongjiang yesterday stating that one Japanese aircraft wreaked havoc in Huiyang and Danshui yesterday, the 24th, killing or injuring more than 20 civilians. The situation is as follows: 1. In Huizhou, at 12:55 PM, one Japanese aircraft came and dropped one bomb. The bomb fell on a civilian residence in a tile alley next to the county government office. The resident's name was Wu. The bomb fell in the courtyard of the house and exploded on the spot, killing or injuring two boys, one girl, and one old woman. 2. In Danshui, a mass meeting was held in Danshui on the same day. At 1:45 PM, a Japanese aircraft flew from the direction of Huizhou, and the crowd at the meeting dispersed immediately. The Japanese aircraft flew low and dropped one bomb. The bomb fell at the entrance of the Shuixiang alley in Danshui, killing one woman and injuring three. 3. In Longgang, at 2:30 PM, a Japanese aircraft flew to the sky above Longgang and flew low and dropped one bomb. The bomb fell opposite the Longgang Juxing Tea House, killing a man named Yu En and a woman named Tan on the spot, and injuring three women. 4. In Pingshan, the Japanese aircraft flew from Longgang to the sky above Pingshan and circled once, then dropped one bomb. It fell next to Pingshan Elementary School, killing or injuring seven women, all of whom were villagers carrying goods to market. The Japanese aircraft that attacked on this day was a light seaplane bomber and seemed to be harassing. Jiang Guangnai summoned by the authorities to fly to Chongqing, rumored to be appointed to an important military position.

### Jiang Guangnai Summoned by Authorities to Fly to Chongqing, Rumored to Be Appointed to an Important Military Position

[Urgent News from Hong Kong] General Jiang Guangnai of the 19th Route Army has been recuperating in Hong Kong since he was recently removed from the position of Commander of the Fourth War Zone of Guangdong Province. General Jiang recently received a telegram from the Central Military Commission, inviting him to Chongqing for consultations. After receiving the invitation, Jiang took a civil aviation plane in Hong Kong to Chongqing that day. It is rumored that Jiang will be appointed to an important military position this time.

### Tianjin Assassination Case All Planned by Japanese and Puppet Forces, Attempt to Blockade Concessions

[Central News Agency Chongqing Report on the 24th] According to people from Tianjin, the assassinations of Wang Zhulin, Jin Bicheng, Kawashima Yoshiko, and others in the British Concession of Tianjin were all planned by the Japanese and puppet forces. The Japanese side intends to use this to coerce the concession authorities, accuse them of harboring anti-Japanese elements, and demand inspections or the blockade of the British and French concessions.

### Sino-Soviet Fisheries Negotiation Still Deadlocked: Accident Before Fishing Season Will Break Off Current Talks

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 23rd] The Sino-Soviet negotiation on the fisheries agreement remains at a standstill. Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigenori Togo, once informed Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov that if the negotiations failed, the Soviet government should bear the responsibility. According to informed sources here, unless an unexpected situation arises before the fishing season begins in April this year, the current negotiations will inevitably break down beyond repair. The core dispute lies in the Soviet government's plan to hold a public tender for the management of fishing grounds in early February, insisting that all locations should be allocated to Japanese fishing companies and Soviet fishing machinery enterprises to prevent Japan from permanently enjoying fishing concessions. Although the Japanese side has not formally refused to participate in the bidding, it has rejected the principle of allocation, insisting that the lease of the fishery rights should be based on the terms of the Portsmouth Treaty (which only allows Japan to enjoy fishing rights in the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Bering Sea, but not in other areas). However, the Soviet government denies that Japan enjoys any priority within Soviet territory and territorial waters, and is prepared to fully exercise its sovereignty, such as enacting fishing regulations. The Soviet side also accuses the Japanese government of being jealous of the rapid development of the Soviet fishing industry in recent years, and therefore deliberately trying to obstruct it. Several years ago, Soviet fishing vessels lacked both ships and personnel, and had to hire Japanese fishermen. Now, however, the Soviet Union has built many fishing vessels and trained its own fishermen, and is naturally unwilling to allow Japan to continue its monopoly. The temporary fisheries agreement, which expired last year, was signed by former Japanese Foreign Minister Koki Hirota and the late Deputy People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Lev Karakhan. The Soviet fishing rights in this agreement were quite restricted, with Japan only agreeing to provide the Soviet Union with a certain number of tons of fish caught each year in exchange. Some now claim that Karakhan was ousted because he was deemed a traitor for losing rights in the fisheries agreement. The gist of the Sino-Soviet fisheries issue is roughly as described above. As for the issue of labor contracts signed by the Soviet Sakhalin Island Japanese Merchant Oil Company and representatives of the Soviet Trade Union, negotiations have also not yet been successful.

### Fourth War Zone Convenes Guerrilla Commander Conference

[Hong Kong News] Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth War Zone, Zhang Fakui, and Chairman of the Provincial Government, Li Hanhun, in order to reorganize the wartime guerrilla forces and to adopt future combat strategies, jointly with Commander-in-Chief of the Twelfth Army Group, Yu Hanmou, and Commander-in-Chief, Xiang Hanping, telegraphed to summon the commanders of various guerrilla districts to hold a conference at a certain location in the middle of next month. They also requested each commander to bring a report on the anti-Japanese activities of the local militia for reference. It is reported that Deputy Commander of the First Guerrilla District, Zhou Yanhua, and Deputy Commander of the Fourth Guerrilla District, Zhang Wodong, etc., have arrived in Hong Kong separately, and this morning (24th) at 4:00 AM, took the Xin Hai Men steamship to Shantou, transferring to another vessel to attend the meeting. It is also reported that the commanders of various guerrilla districts are also traveling to attend the meeting separately.

### Frugality Banquet: Eight Yuan per Table, Six Dishes and One Soup: Chongqing Authorities Promote Thrift

[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Chongqing, 24th] The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has decided that banquets should not cost more than eight yuan per table, with six dishes and one soup, named "Frugality Banquet". Violators will be severely punished.

### Wang Jingwei's Passive Attitude

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 24th] Chinese political figures claim, according to reliable sources, that Wang Jingwei is still in Hanoi, adopting a passive attitude. His plan to participate in the puppet government in Beiping has also been completely shelved due to the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet and the opposition of the puppet government in Nanjing. It is also said that Wang is currently adopting a "three nos" policy: not participating in puppet organizations, not approving scorched-earth resistance, and not interacting with the Hiranuma Cabinet. Relatives and friends refuse to entertain him.

### Mei Shiping Goes to Shanghai: Relatives and Friends Refuse to Entertain Him

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 24th] According to Chinese reports, Mei Shiping, a confidant of Wang Jingwei, secretly arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that Mei and Lin Bosheng jointly issued Wang Jingwei's peace declaration to the press in Hong Kong. Afterwards, their official positions were dismissed by the National Government. Mei's relatives and friends in Shanghai despise his behavior, and therefore refuse to entertain him.

### Storm of Questions in the Japanese House of Representatives: No Solution to Fiscal and Diplomatic Issues; Representatives Pessimistic About the Future

[Foreign Dispatch from Hong Kong, 24th] During yesterday's meeting of the Japanese Diet, a countermeasure was decided upon in case economic sanctions were adopted by Britain or the United States. This warning was given in response to the concerns of representatives about the recent attitudes of Britain and the United States, and their demands that the Japanese government express its attitude. Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita rose to reply that Japan would resolutely continue its policy of establishing a new order in East Asia. If a third country were to intervene, Japan had already decided on a countermeasure. Navy Minister Mitsumasa Yonai also made a similar statement, saying that the Navy was sufficient to defend Japan, and that he did not believe that a third country would adopt extreme policies.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] A TASS dispatch from Tokyo, 24th, reports that the questioning period in the Tokyo Lower House of Representatives began on the 23rd. In addition to the questioning by Seiyukai party member Tagawa, reported in yesterday's telegram, there was also questioning by Seiyukai party member Miyazawa. The gist of his points was that renewing the administration, boosting morale, and establishing a wartime system were urgent tasks for the new cabinet, but the means of digesting public bonds and revitalizing foreign trade were prerequisites. Would the government compensate for the huge military expenditures of the past by increasing debt or increasing taxes? How would the huge amount of public bonds for the next year be digested? And rather than restricting imports, how would exports be revitalized? What were the government's countermeasures? Finance Minister Otohiko Ishiwata only replied that although the sale of public bonds had declined after October of last year, it had gradually recovered this spring. Although the Bank of Japan's banknotes had been issued to over 2.85 billion yen by the end of the year, they had now decreased to 2.1 billion yen. All of his responses were forcibly optimistic observations from pessimistic facts, and he avoided discussing the key points. Abe, the leader of the Social Masses Party, asked how the government would concentrate national strength to carry out its so-called long-term construction. Prime Minister Hiranuma had no concrete plan to answer, and his emptiness can be imagined. Miura, an executive member of the right-wing Toho Kai, asked why Arita's diplomacy was still a diplomacy of compromise, and why the government did not adopt a more proactive policy to handle the "China Incident." Arita replied that there was a fixed policy towards China, and that there was no need to cause unnecessary friction with third countries. The first round of questioning ended at this point. Looking at the questions from all parties, their sense of anxiety about the future was obvious. The answers from Hiranuma, Arita, and Ishiwata were still nothing more than a set of clichés.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 24th] A TASS dispatch from Tokyo, 24th, reports that according to official sources, the Japanese naval budget for 1939-1940 is 7.048 billion yen, of which 5 billion yen is for war expenses. The total national budget for Japan in 1939-1940 is 10 billion yen, which is expected to be submitted to the Diet for discussion in a few days.

Konoe Attacked by Representatives: To Resign as Minister Without Portfolio

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 24th] The Japanese press suggests that former Prime Minister Konoe plans to resign from his position as Minister Without Portfolio in the current cabinet because Konoe did not attend the Diet yesterday. Many representatives in the Diet have asked Konoe to attend and explain why he, as a Privy Councillor, can simultaneously serve as a cabinet member and participate in practical politics. However, people in the Japanese government (especially in the army) claim that Konoe's situation should be an exception, which is sufficient to show that Japan's policy toward China has not changed. Konoe claimed that he did not attend yesterday's Diet due to illness.

### A Record of the Visit with Mr. Li Genyuan, the Cultivator of Military Leaders in Our Country (Continued)

— Li Baoquan, Special Correspondent for this Newspaper in Kunming

Mr. Li is exactly sixty years old this year. He has held almost every important position in the country. Apart from being the chief instructor of the Yunnan Military Academy when he first returned from studying in Japan, he has also served as the Military Affairs Director of the Hunan-Jiangxi Border Defense, the Minister of Military Affairs and Commander of the Second Army, the Coastal Defense Director, the Commander-in-Chief of the Yunnan Army, the Garrison Commander of Nanxiong and Lianzhou, and the Garrison Commander of Qiongyai. Beyond these "military" positions, Mr. Li also has outstanding research and development in "politics and economics." Mr. Li was the original founder of our country's Bureau of Standards. Mr. Li has also held civilian positions such as Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, Prime Minister, Governor of Shaanxi Province, and Member of Parliament, and has achieved excellent results. However, although Mr. Li has been constantly serving in important national positions since the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, he still has nothing to his name. When he was in Suzhou, he built a house in Xiaowang Mountain for seclusion. When Suzhou fell, all his properties were lost. His current life in Kunming is supported by donations from his former students and friends. Mr. Li, a man who has held important national positions, still lives a simple life. This is something that others cannot match.

When I talked to Mr. Li about the purpose and work of his trip to Yunnan, he said without hesitation: "Yunnan is my hometown. The current local military and government leaders in Yunnan, like Chairman Long, have historical relationships with me privately. However, my return to Yunnan this time is not to reminisce with Chairman Long and others, nor is it to plan provincial affairs. Those are all personal matters, and I do not want to make them the main topic of discussion with Chairman Long and others. As soon as I met Chairman Long, I stated that my return to Kunming this time was entirely because Yunnan is now an important center for national transportation, politics, education, and military affairs. Yunnan is now not only an important province in the Southwest but also an important strategic location for the entire country. We have enough to talk about in discussing the national long-term resistance plan. We do not have time to discuss personal matters unless they have a direct or indirect significant relationship with the country."

That is true. The issues that Mr. Li is currently paying attention to and expressing are all focused on the entire country. For example, he recently wrote to Chairman Chiang regarding the "North-South Line issue of the Yunnan-Burma Railway," which was entirely based on the future of national border defense, politics, economy, culture, and other aspects, without any selfish thoughts. From this, one can see Mr. Li's usual attitude towards life.

Premier Kong of the Executive Yuan once telegraphed to invite Mr. Li to Chongqing to discuss national affairs, but Mr. Li declined for the time being because his health had not fully recovered and the doctor would not allow him to take a plane immediately. He will go there when he recovers in the future.

Finally, when I asked him about Wang Jingwei's defection and Yunnan's military and political stance in the national war of resistance, Mr. Li resolutely said: "Based on Wang's past repeated inconsistencies, this defection is expected. We don't need to mention this heartless and insane person too much now. As for Yunnan in this national long-term war of resistance, Yunnan completely takes the Central Government's will as its own. Even if it means sacrificing every soldier, we will never give up this position. Please tell the readers of Shenbao at home and abroad in the newspaper that I can take full responsibility for this guarantee."

Mr. Li became more and more excited as he spoke, but his health had not yet recovered. The reporter did not dare to talk more, so he said goodbye to Mr. Li. At my repeated request, Mr. Li continued to hold my hand at the gate, stopping my farewell steps. (End)

### A New Era in the Relationship Between Kham and Tibet (Part 1)

— Liu Zunqi

I. The crux of the dispute between Kham and Tibet

Before the end of the Qing Dynasty, there was no so-called relationship between Kham and Tibet; what existed was the relationship between Kham and the Chinese mainland. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the foreign tribes of Kham and Tibet were deceived and subjugated. Internally, the religious forces in Kham and Tibet were still in their infancy, and they did not have much power to expand outwards. In the late Ming Dynasty, the Gelug sect gradually surpassed the Sakya sect, and at the same time, its economic power and military force were expanding day by day. During the reign of Qing Taizong, the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama of Tibet and the Khoshut Khan of Qinghai even automatically sent envoys to Shengjing to offer local products. Qing Taizong, wishing to destroy the Ming Dynasty, was afraid of the Mongols, and this opportunity came at the right time. He sent envoys to inquire about the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama in the eighth year of Chongde, calling them Vajra Masters. But even during this period, it was still a simple Tibetan issue.

However, the political and military power of the Gelug sect lamas gradually developed to the entire area of ​​western Sichuan, everywhere confronting the monk kings and chieftains sealed by the Yuan and Ming dynasties. In the thirty-ninth year of Kangxi, Zhaba Changze Jielie of western Sichuan actually occupied Dajianlu, openly invading eastward, attempting to encircle Daduhe and attack Luding. Later, although the Sichuan Governor-General Xierda, Governor Beihenuo, and Admiral Tang Xishun jointly suppressed and quelled the rebellion, recaptured the city of Dajianlu, and captured and executed Changze Jielie, restoring the duties of the chieftains, trouble between Kham and Tibet has since become rampant.

At the same time, after Britain annexed India, in order to guard against imperial Russia, it attempted to use Tibet as a subordinate vassal, and began to carry out various activities.

It was not until the 30th year of Guangxu that the Qing court, realizing that it would be insufficient to defend Sichuan internally without actively managing western Sichuan, ordered the Sichuan Governor-General Xiliang to jointly recover Zhandui with the Tibetan Resident Minister You Tai and Deputy Minister Feng Quan to secure the frontier. Among them, Feng Quan was the most active. The following year, he went to Batang and was killed for handling military affairs. In the autumn of the thirty-second year, the Qing court established the Minister of Border Affairs of Sichuan and Yunnan in western Sichuan, with Zhao Erfeng as its head. After receiving the order, Zhao trained troops and reclaimed land, reformed the chieftain system, and managed the area with great vigor. In five years, he achieved remarkable results.

It is impossible to fully describe the history of Zhao Erfeng's management of western Sichuan in this article. However, the important fact is that since Zhao, western Sichuan has had a special status and has had various relations with Tibet. During the Zhao Erfeng era, he did not show any leniency towards the chieftains; nor did he show any leniency towards the separatism and arrogance of the lama temples. However, in positive aspects, he was able to operate with dedication and with public integrity and fairness, which did not give the Tibetans any grounds to complain. However, his successors after Zhao's death, from Bing Changheng onwards, such as Zhang Xu in the second year of the Republic of China, Liu Ruiheng in the third year of the Republic of China, Gu Chengxian in the fourth year of the Republic of China, and Chen Xieduan from the fifth to thirteenth years of the Republic of China, and Liu Chengdong from the thirteenth to sixteenth years of the Republic of China, consistently lacked the military might to deter the Tibetans, and their political achievements were often disorganized and bleak. They even allowed their soldiers to plunder the people and trample on the lamas, causing the Yellow Sect to despise the Han people and openly resist. As described by Liu Yiqing and others in "Expedition to Kham and Tibet" (Volume 30): "...The situation in Litang (i.e., Lihua) is very different from the outside world. There are no garrison soldiers within the territory, and the so-called officials are only two Han magistrates. The people suffered deeply from the soldiers' trampling in the past, so they aroused counterattacks and carried out self-defense movements. The stationed troops were forcibly stationed in the lama temples, using the lamas to demand things from the people. If they sent money or sent errands and slightly went against their will, they would declare that they would set fire to the temples and massacre the lamas. The scholars respected the lamas very much, and often endured humiliation to seek completeness. In the end, the accumulated resentment was too deep and suddenly broke out, and the soldiers were driven out of the country..." These undeniable realities gave the Tibetan side the opportunity to assist some anti-resistance forces in western Sichuan. Its most notable evolution was the case of the Ganzi Lamas, such as the Great Golden Temple, which has been troubling the area for nearly a decade since the 19th year of the Republic of China. In the past ten years or so, the Great Golden Temple case has occupied a decisive position in the Kham-Tibet issue. The two sides have engaged in fighting several times, and the disputes have been unresolved. On a small scale, it is only a struggle between one or two lama temples; on a large scale, it is the entire issue of western Sichuan against Tibet. If we expand it further, it can be said that it is a dispute containing serious international significance.

However, this major and complex dispute was completely resolved in Degge County on the second day of this month, the day after the establishment of the Xikang Provincial Government, with a spirit of mutual concessions and mutual understanding. The relationship between Kham and Tibet has ushered in a new era, which is undoubtedly of great significance, especially in today's more difficult war of resistance.

Now, let us report the whole story of the Great Golden Temple case.

II. From Temple Dispute to Kham-Tibetan Conflict

The Great Golden Temple is a famous large Lama Temple on the northern route of western Sichuan, located in Ganzi County, sixty li northwest of the county seat. The temple has more than two thousand lamas. Although the number of people is not as large as that of Ganzi Temple (Ganzi Temple has four thousand people), it has two major characteristics: First, the temple property is extremely large, controlling the northern route and trade with Tibet, and the income is the most abundant. It is said that the temple's cellar stores Bianzhuang silver, which can be used for the salaries of the entire Kham garrison for ten years; Second, it is directly connected to Tibet, connected to both sides of the Jinsha River through Dege. There are backers to rely on. Because of this, the lamas in the temple not only have money but also have power. On the one hand, they do everything possible to oppress other lamas; on the other hand, they act recklessly towards the Han Chinese government.

The beginning of the incident was very subtle, but after a complex evolution, it eventually led to a frontal confrontation between Kham and Tibet. Originally, the southeast neighbor of the Great Golden Temple was the jurisdiction of the Baili chieftain. There are three major lama temples in the territory: —— Baili Temple, Chunzhe Temple, and Yala Temple. A hundred years ago, Baili Temple was robbed by bandits. Later, with the help of the monks of Yala Temple, the bandits were driven back. The Baili chieftain, out of gratitude, allowed the monks of Yala Temple to jointly manage Baili Temple.

The problem occurred after the death of a Hukhan Ketu (abbot) of Yala Temple, who was "reincarnated" in the Ningchong Sangduo family, a Hutu Ketu in the Great Golden Temple, named Yala Guzi. His family had sent him to Lhasa to study, and after completing his studies, he solicited the favor of the Zili chieftain and brought him from the border of the Great Golden Temple to Baili to preside over Yala Temple. At the same time, he could naturally also manage Baili Temple. At that time, Baili Temple was dilapidated. Yala Guzi used his family wealth to renovate it and restore its old appearance. Just at this time, the old Baili chieftain died without a son, leaving only one daughter, who married the son of the Gacha chieftain. Later, she was driven away by the wife of the Gacha chieftain. After returning home, she gave birth to a son out of wedlock, and this son was made the successor to the Baihe chieftain.

Just as the Baili chieftain was weak, the Hutu Ketu of Chunpeng Temple, mentioned above, coveted the temple property and power of Yala Temple. He then bewitched the daughter of the Baili chieftain (i.e., the daughter-in-law of the Gacha chieftain who had been driven away) to drive out Yala Guzi. After Yala Guzi was forced to return to the Ningchong family in the Great Golden territory, he asked the Great Golden Temple to retaliate. The Great Golden Temple had always been unscrupulous, and getting this opportunity, it naturally "would not give way." As a result, a conflict occurred.

In the winter of the 19th year of the Republic of China, on a day for performing "Jumping Gods", the Great Golden Temple sent people to set fire to Yala Temple. Lamas consider burning a temple the greatest insult. So this time, it turned into a public outrage on the entire Baili side. The three major lama temples of Baili united to start a war with the Great Golden Temple; as a result, of course, the Baili side could not defeat the Great Golden Temple. It began to yield while appealing to the Ganzi County government to seek redress. The county government initially wanted to mediate fairly, but since the Great Golden Temple refused to accept it, it turned to the garrison (Liu Wenhui's troops) for military suppression. After the troops arrived, the Great Golden Temple knew that the matter had become a big mess, so it simply sought help from the Tibetan army of Rongba Cha on the bank of the Jinsha River. The Tibetan side aided it with a large amount of military fire, and later directly sent troops to fight against Baili and Liu Wenhui's troops. At this point, the dispute between the Great Golden Temple and Baili turned into a frontal conflict between Kham and Tibet.

III. From the Beginning of the War to the Armistice

The frontal clash between the two sides lasted about two months. (Spring of the 20th year of the Republic of China). Liu Wenhui telegraphed the central government for instructions. The central government believed that the matter was of great importance, so on March 29 of the 20th year, it sent Tang Ke to Kham to mediate. At the same time, it also asked the Dalai Lama to send someone to negotiate with Tang Ke. It also sent a telegram, sending Abu Ke to Ganzi to be responsible for mediation; who knew that Abu stayed in Qamdo for six months, and then the "September 18" Incident occurred. The Tibetan side took the opportunity to increasingly collude with the Great Golden Temple, and the reconciliation completely failed. Tang Ke returned without results. The Han and Tibetan armies then officially went to war on the east bank of the Jinsha River. After a whole year, the Tibetan army gradually became unable to sustain itself, and successively withdrew from Dege, Dengke Baiyu, and Shiqu, all the way to the west of the Jinsha River. At the same time, it sent personnel to sign a ceasefire agreement with Liu's army in Ada, a subordinate of Dege, on the east bank of the Jinsha River. These conditions, due to various reasons in the past, have not been published. Now that the incident has ended, it may be disclosed. The full text is as follows: [To be continued]

### Executive Yuan Appropriates Five Million Yuan: Develop Industry: Establish an Industrial Cooperative Association: Divide Regions to Handle Cooperative Matters

[Special dispatch from our newspaper in Chongqing, 24th] In order to establish a strong wartime economy and seek industrial recovery and development, the Executive Yuan has allocated five million yuan to establish the China Industrial Cooperative Association, dividing the country into four regions: Northwest, Southwest, Southeast, and Central China. The general headquarters will be located in Chongqing to handle national industrial cooperative matters.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 24th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs announced that more than 300 factories formerly located in coastal areas have now resumed operation in the rear, with more than 50 of them located in Sichuan Province. Most of them are machinery factories and textile factories. Among the textile factories, two have more than 2,000 spindles each. There are also two North China coal mining companies operating in Sichuan Province. Therefore, the Japanese attempt to destroy China's modern industry has failed again.

### Chamberlain's Broadcast: Preparing to Resist Aggression, Emphasizing the Threat of Air Raids, and Appealing for People to Enlist

— Chamberlain

[Reuters, London, 23rd] British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a broadcast speech today, initiating the British government's campaign to enlist volunteers for various national defense departments. He stated that, in the opinion of government officials, a national voluntary service system is essential. "This system is to prepare us for war. This does not mean that I believe war is imminent. You all know that I have done my best to maintain peace and will continue to do so. We will never initiate a war, but we may have to participate in a war initiated by other countries. If other countries believe that we cannot defend ourselves, then we may be attacked. The more prepared we are for self-defense and resistance to aggression, the less dare aggressors take risks, as their chances of success are very small." Chamberlain emphasized that modern warfare is different from past wars. "The development of modern air forces has made our homeland unsafe. The victims of air raids are not only soldiers, sailors, and pilots, but also civilians. Civilians may be the first to suffer. This is true in our country and also in continental Europe. Therefore, if we want to protect civilians in wartime, we must conduct necessary organization in peacetime, and we must train in peacetime, as there will be no time for training after the war begins. Therefore, our plan is preventive in nature, and its importance is no less than battleships, artillery, and aircraft. However, this does not mean that the god of war is about to descend. I hope you will all carefully read the handbook issued by the government, as what is discussed in it is related to all of you. In the handbook, you will understand how to ensure public safety and how to serve after the war breaks out." Chamberlain asked citizens who have not participated in major national defense work to quickly choose the work they are most competent for and receive the necessary training. He concluded by saying that some people believe that this voluntary registration system is not very effective and that a compulsory registration system would be more effective. "However, compulsory registration is not in line with our democratic system and tradition of freedom. We firmly believe that we do not need compulsory methods to obtain all the national defense personnel we need. You have always asked how you can serve the country. This government proposal can give you the opportunity to show the world that free people are preparing to defend their freedom and ideals. I firmly believe that my request will receive your full response."

[Central News Agency, London, 24th] As the national military service campaign has begun, the British air defense authorities issued a notice yesterday, urging people from all walks of life to actively join the air defense forces. Nationals over the age of 25 can report for participation.

[Reuters, London, 24th] After Anderson, the British Minister of Civilian Protection, launched the national service campaign, the Home Office immediately issued a notice, asking local authorities to quickly recruit volunteers for air defense. The notice mentioned that a list of temporarily exempt occupations will be promulgated, stating that only those over the age of 29 can be exempted, and those under the age of 25 can still join the air defense service. Also, those over the age of 25 whose occupations are on the list of temporary exemptions may be allowed to participate in their spare time if they volunteer.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 24th] Group Captain Mack, who has served in the British Air Force for 25 years, resigned yesterday in protest of the inadequacy of British air defense. Mack has represented Britain at the Geneva Disarmament Conference in the past two years. According to Mack, when war was likely to break out last September, military organization and training of the air force were inadequate, but this situation has not been remedied to this day. Therefore, he resigned to draw the attention of Parliament and the people to the inadequacy of British air force policy.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 24th] Australian Foreign Minister Hughes said in a radio speech here a few days ago that if countries want to avoid war and Australia wants to save itself, they should take action immediately. The threat of dictatorial countries in the Far East to Australia is becoming increasingly urgent. If Australia does not prepare immediately, it will be doomed. Australia should now move rapidly towards war preparation, leaving everything else behind. Certain countries are setting fires everywhere. Can Australia take warning?

### Italy Calls Up Reservists: Anticipating a New European Crisis; Eden's Speech Expresses Concern Over the Spanish War, Advocating a Firm Stance by Britain and France

[Associated Press, Rome, 23rd] According to reports from Italy and abroad, thousands of reservists, or even the entire population born in 1901, will be mobilized to prepare for the world crisis after the end of the Spanish War. According to an officer of that grade, he has received a general mobilization notice, and he believes that the people of that grade will be fully mobilized, except for the Guards and Carabinieri. This move will allow the Italian army to immediately increase from 300,000 to 500,000 men.

[Central News Agency, London, 24th] Former British Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech yesterday, expressing concern about the Spanish war situation. He believes that in the current situation, the most effective way for Britain and France to cooperate for peace is to express their determination to protect the Mediterranean and other interests.

[Central News Agency, Corwen, Warwickshire, England, 23rd] Former Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech, expressing dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy towards Italy. He said that if Britain and France can maintain their national interests with an indomitable and resolute attitude, it will make a great contribution to the peaceful situation. As far as the Spanish issue is concerned, the interests that Britain and France have in Spain are vital to survival. The political independence and territorial integrity of Spain must be respected. How the fate of the country is decided should not be determined by one or several countries. The Nationalist troops are attacking Barcelona with powerful artillery and air force. Who supplies these weapons is already known to everyone. Those who supply this military equipment have willingly signed agreements accepting the restraint of non-intervention, and are still openly violating the agreements they have signed. Foreign volunteers belonging to the Spanish government army have all withdrawn, but the bombers of the Nationalist side are foreign pilots, the artillerymen who fire the guns are foreign artillerymen, and the infantry who roam the territory are foreign infantry. If the Nationalist army wins, it is no different from saying that a foreign country has won. At this moment, it is certain that a certain country, on the one hand, declares non-intervention in the Spanish civil war, and on the other hand, provides full assistance to the Spanish Nationalist army, so that it can win the final victory, and is not satisfied with this. It announces to us that if France dares to intervene in the Spanish civil war, its attitude will be reconsidered by those countries, regardless of their size. How can we establish friendship on the basis of such tacit conditions?

### French Political Circles: Extremely Uneasy

[Central News Agency, Paris, 23rd] As the Nationalist army advances rapidly, France is extremely uneasy. Political figures firmly believe that as soon as the Spanish civil war ends, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will formally make various demands to France, refuse to fulfill his promises, and continue to station troops in the Spanish mainland and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean to threaten France. The French government hopes that Prime Minister Mussolini's guarantee not to covet Spanish territory will remain effective and does not intend to take any action. However, if Italian troops do not withdraw from the Spanish Balearic Islands, France will also have the right to send troops to Spanish Morocco in Africa and other places. Regarding this, The Times, which has always been known for its moderation, has also expressed its approval, which is quite noteworthy. The newspaper also advocated that the French government should send commercial representatives to the city of Burgos, where the Spanish Nationalist government is located, and consult with Germany in accordance with the Franco-German Peace Declaration of December 6 last year to avoid a tense situation that would force France to take action. Ribbentrop's visit to Poland will discuss this.

### Germany Does Not Forget Ukraine: Ribbentrop's Visit to Poland Will Discuss This

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] Today, the Ukrainian National Association in Germany expressed its opinion that the Ukrainians must take territories from the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia to achieve the ultimate goal of a Greater Ukraine. This statement was made to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Ukrainian state. Ukrainians in the Sudetenland and Vienna districts also attended the conference.

[Reuters, Berlin, 24th] When German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visits Warsaw, Poland, this week, he will discuss the issue of Germany and Poland maintaining close friendly relations. It is also heard that the issues of Ukraine, Danzig, and Memel will also be the main discussion goals this time. It is also widely believed that this visit is to provide Hitler with information for his speech in Congress on the 30th.

### Rumors of Military Action in Austria: Switzerland Increases Border Troops, but Denies Taking Special Measures

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] A telegram from Switzerland published in this newspaper today stated that Switzerland's increase in border troops was due to rumors of military action in Austria, with the aim of reducing the panic of border residents. As for the rumors of military action in Austria, they have not yet been confirmed.

[Reuters, Swiss Capital, 23rd] Because of "bad news on the eastern border of Switzerland," the government of the canton of St. Gallen has dispatched 100 more soldiers to strengthen the border defense. Although the news has not been announced, various rumors of a general mobilization of the Swiss army and special measures taken by the government have been officially denied as unfounded.

### British Cabinet Holds a Subcommittee Meeting: Focuses on the German Question, Rumors of Germany and Italy Making Colonial Demands

[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] Prime Minister Chamberlain received opposition Labor Party leaders Attlee and Greenwood this afternoon and informed them of the recent talks between British and Italian cabinet members in Rome. He then temporarily convened a cabinet subcommittee meeting. Foreign Secretary Halifax, Home Secretary Hoare, Minister for Coordination of Defence Inskip, President of the Board of Trade Stanley, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs MacDonald, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cadogan, and the British government's diplomatic advisor Vansittart were all in attendance. The meeting lasted from 3 pm to 5 pm. It is said that the most important discussion was on the German question. Since the dismissal of Schacht, the president of the German Central Bank, the situation has changed. In addition, the German government has recently promulgated several military orders, concentrating all power in the National Socialist Party, which must be paid attention to. According to rumors, the German army will partially mobilize in the middle of next month. After the end of the Spanish Civil War, Germany and Italy will raise the entire issue of colonies. Upon hearing this, the British side commented extensively, saying that French Foreign Minister Bonnet is scheduled to deliver a speech to the French National Assembly tomorrow, and British Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to deliver a speech in Birmingham on the 28th of this month, explaining where the "British line of resistance" lies. German leader Hitler is scheduled to deliver a speech on the 30th of this month, the sixth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. The international situation will be revealed at that time.

### The Spanish Government Appoints an Official to Defend Barcelona: Deploys Fortifications to Prepare for Street Fighting, the Rebel Vanguard is Only Ten Miles from the City

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 24th] German Ambassador to France Welczeck spoke with French Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday. Diplomatic circles believe that they were discussing the Spanish issue.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] President Roosevelt met with the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Saint-Gaudens, today to discuss the international situation.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] Regarding the issue of whether the US ban on arms shipments to Spain should be lifted, Secretary of State Hull said that the legal experts of the State Department are carefully studying the arguments put forward in Stimson's letter.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 24th] According to today's official gazette, the government has appointed General Rojo, the former defender of Madrid, as the official to defend Barcelona. The government hopes that General Rojo can recreate the mystery of defending Madrid, that is, when he was defending Madrid, he suddenly strengthened the defense line at the last moment, preventing the rebels from attacking the city.

[Central News Agency, Hendaye, 24th] The defense line of the Spanish government army in the town of Martorell, on the outskirts of Barcelona, has been breached. The Nationalist army is now only ten miles away from Barcelona. Men, women, and children in the city are actively deploying fortifications along the streets in preparation for street fighting. The rebel vanguard can now see Barcelona in the distance.

[Central News Agency, Lleida, 24th] It is reported that a certain unit of the Spanish rebels has approached Mediona (located on the road between Barcelona and Igualada), only 14 miles from Barcelona.

[Central News Agency, Barcelona, 24th] The Spanish government held a meeting yesterday and decided to organize a committee to handle the evacuation of the population of Barcelona. Men and women throughout the city have set off with weapons to resist the rebel attack. Since midnight yesterday, rebel planes have carried out large-scale bombings of Valencia. One British ship was sunk and one was severely damaged. Two other British ships were hit and injured seven miles from Barcelona, killing 21 people. One of the two British ships was damaged in 14 places by bombs, but it did not sink.

[Central News Agency, Barcelona, 24th] The Spanish government is now preparing to make Barcelona a military zone. The situation in the city is now similar to that of the former capital, Madrid, after the outbreak of the Spanish war. All commercial activities in the city have been suspended. All the people have turned out to build defenses. The cabinet held a meeting late last week and issued a communiqué, stating that the government is determined to protect Barcelona. However, some government agencies will be moved elsewhere. The cabinet meeting also decided to implement a state of war in the territory under the jurisdiction of the Spanish government, stipulating that all resources are to be controlled by the Ministry of National Defense and military authorities. Yesterday, the bars, cafes, and privately owned restaurants in Barcelona were all closed. Hotels are still open as usual, but only military personnel and refugees in transit are allowed to live in them. Rebel planes continue to bomb.

Britain and the United States Advise Nationals to Evacuate

[Reuters, Barcelona, 23rd] The British authorities have notified their nationals here that those who wish to leave the city and board the HMS Greyhound must do so tonight or tomorrow. However, all the British businessmen here said they wanted to stay.

[Reuters, London, 23rd] It has been learned from well-informed sources in London that the British Minister to Spain, Stevenson, is maintaining close contact with the British naval authorities in the area. The British destroyers HMS Dainty and HMS Greyhound are both nearby. Stevenson has drawn up a preliminary plan for the evacuation of embassy staff (about 20 people including consulate staff). Other British nationals, about 200 people, will also leave if necessary. There has been no decision on the actual evacuation. All the measures taken are for contingency purposes. Stevenson will take appropriate steps depending on the actions of the Spanish government.

A Short Commentary

### "Frugal Virtues Banquet" and the Old New Year

The national crisis is so serious that all viable and non-viable forces in the country should concentrate on contributing to the cause of national reconstruction, so all daily life and social entertainment expenses should be reduced to the minimum. Enduring personal temporary hardship, seeking a hundred generations of happiness for descendants, and seeking eternal freedom for the nation are all essential in terms of sentiment and handling.

According to a special dispatch from this newspaper's Chongqing branch on the 24th, "The Chongqing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has decided that each table of banquets should not exceed eight yuan, six dishes and one soup, called the 'Frugal Virtues Banquet'. Violators will be punished." This move is indeed worthy of being advocated throughout the country, especially the two words "Frugal Virtues," which seem to be more meaningful than "thrift."

The Lunar New Year is approaching. According to social customs, we have worked hard all year round, and it is not too much to have fun at this time. However, looking back at the motherland, where the flames of war are everywhere, and looking around, where refugees are like ants, no one with a heart will not be moved by it. Therefore, although we dare not hope that all sectors of the Hong Kong community will unanimously implement the "Frugal Virtues Banquet" movement, we hope that all industries can donate one day of charity sales to help war-torn refugees. We also hope that all relevant groups will expand fundraising campaigns and actively promote the work of rescuing refugees and assisting in ××. The one-still motion should be developed into a glorious competition. Compatriots in the motherland, who have suffered severely from the trampling and shelling of the ×× iron cavalry, are still striving hard and practicing frugal virtues; front-line soldiers are fighting for national liberation and bloody resistance, and the more they fight, the more vigorous they become; our overseas compatriots, who live overseas, so those who repay the country and seek peace of mind, first and foremost donate generously—we hope that readers will take the lead, spread the word, so that they can be without shame in front of friends from other countries!

### World Youth Help Us Resist Japan

At the Second World Youth Peace Conference held at Warsaw Women's University in New York, the representatives of more than 50 countries participating in the conference unanimously passed the resolution to support our country's war of resistance against Japan, resolving to (1) stop transporting military supplies and kerosene to support the Japanese troops and refuse to lend money to Japan, (2) governments of all countries should implement boycotts of Japanese goods; (3) the people of all countries should earnestly expand the boycott of Japanese goods movement and encourage the purchase of Chinese goods; (4) the international community should guarantee loans to China to help China enrich its national defense and promote internal construction. This proves that the youth all over the world sympathize and protect our opposition to the Japanese fascist aggression, and also proves that our war of resistance against Japan is also maintaining the meaning of world peace, which has been recognized by the youth all over the world. However, we must infinitely expand this international assistance into an invincible force to sanction Japanese and German-Italian fascist aggressors. That requires our current efforts and achievements are clearly not enough—we must redouble our efforts to improve and develop the unified front of the country's youth itself, and at the same time redouble our efforts to promote the unified front of the world's youth against fascism and anti-aggression. Young students in Hong Kong should also recognize their great mission in the current emergency stage, carry forward the achievements of the past, and redouble their efforts to temper themselves, educate the masses, and expand the united front from the theoretical struggle and the work of national salvation.

### Romania Under the Gaze of the National Socialist Party (Continued)

Romania is one of the countries in the Balkan Peninsula, and its fate is intertwined with that of other countries. In the past, the Little Entente included Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia, but it has now effectively ceased to exist. Another Balkan alliance has emerged, including Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey. Romania's southern neighbor, Bulgaria, is not included due to its similar situation with Hungary, but it is surrounded by them.

After the Munich Agreement, the King of Romania and the King of Greece, as well as the Regent of Yugoslavia, visited England one after another. The chiefs of staff of the Balkan Alliance countries met in Athens to jointly plan for self-defense. They put forward the slogan "The Balkans belong to the Balkan countries" to oppose external forces' intrusion and advocated for actively and practically resolving disputes over minority issues.

On July 31, they signed a non-aggression treaty with Bulgaria in Thessaloniki, allowing Bulgaria to rearm. France also provided Bulgaria with a large loan and increased commercial relations, which can be seen as a symbol of Bulgaria's anti-fascism. In August, the Balkan countries met in Bled and agreed to Hungary's rearmament, aiming to adjust the relationships among the Balkan countries themselves and resist fascist aggression.

Recently, King George of Greece, in a conversation with Mr. Madol, a reporter for the Sunday Referee in London, stated: "We people of the Balkan Peninsula have today set an example for the world. We have resolved our mutual disputes in an absolutely peaceful manner. Now, all countries understand that there are no fortifications between Greece and Turkey. During the European crisis in September, the Balkan countries were united and prepared for war. We have become a nation of 70 million people, with 5 million soldiers ready to go to the front line."

British Conservative Party leader Winston Churchill recently discussed the future of the Balkan Peninsula countries in an article titled "Dangers in Eastern Europe," stating that although Poland obtained the German city of Teschen from Czechoslovakia, Hitler would demand a price for it. The target of the so-called Greater Ukraine independence movement in Poland is Danzig and the corridor area. The Soviet Union may not stand idly by. The reason Foreign Minister Beck was eager to sign a new Soviet-Polish agreement was for this very reason.

After the Munich Agreement, Eastern European countries were surrounded by dangers and were like startled birds. Among the independent and peaceful countries, it is hard to say who will become Hitler's next victim.

Romania's situation is very tense, but the recent meeting between the King of England and Carol gave London a good impression. They felt that he was very talented and capable of navigating dangers. However, with Romania possessing oil and grain, and with domestic minorities and neighboring Hungary waiting for revenge, the country's fate is always precarious.

These two threatened countries are fortunate to be adjacent to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's contributions in the Far East have already earned the admiration of Britain and the United States. How it will respond in Europe is certainly worthy of attention.

Post-war Turkey has become a force to be reckoned with. Greece and Turkey are very friendly, and the relationship between both countries and England has never been strained. England lent Turkey a 6 million pound loan this year, which greatly helped Turkey and earned a lot of goodwill. The King of Greece has lived in England for many years and is intelligent and decisive, capable of cooperating with England. The union of these three countries has a good influence on Bulgaria. Since the Thessaloniki Conference, it has rejoined the group of Balkan countries, which is a concrete expression of this.

"If these countries can unite and form an armed fortress of peace, national prosperity and peace will not be a problem. Otherwise, they will be individually defeated by Germany. If they allow the spread of fascist heresies within their countries, then great disaster will befall them."

Therefore, Romania has only two paths before it: surrender or resistance. After the partition of Czechoslovakia, Romania is in the same position as Hungary after Germany annexed Austria. Under the direct pressure of the National Socialist Party's forces, it is objectively no longer allowed to ride two horses and simultaneously maneuver between two forces. It is the last barrier to the aggressor's eastward advance and the last gateway to the treasure trove of the Near East for Britain and France. The gain or loss of Romania is of decisive significance to the success or failure of Hitler's ambitions. The first path is very simple, and the result is also obvious. After surrendering, Germany will obtain its resources, especially the oil needed for modern mechanized weapons. Regardless of whether Carol's throne can be maintained, Romania will be monopolized by Hitler's lackeys, such as the Iron Guard and the German Party, and will serve as a vanguard for the National Socialist Party's eastward expedition and become its sacrifice,沦落 to a battlefield for a European war.

Resistance is the more likely alternative. This is the common direction unanimously advocated by the entire country, except for the National Socialist Party's lackeys. Based on various advantageous objective conditions in the international arena, Hitler, though powerful, is not enough to fight as long as an international united front against fascism is established.

Romania's fate hinges on domestic unity, unwavering determination, and the completion of an international united front against fascism in Europe. As Litvinov said, "Peace is indivisible." Only under a collective security system can Romania have a bright future. (The End)

### Li Zhengyao Returns from Attending the Youth Congress, Discusses the World's Youth's Commitment to Aid China and Resist Japan, International Figures Express Warm Sympathy for Our Heroic Resistance Against Japan, Representatives from Forty-Seven Countries Sign the Warsaw Pact Against Aggression

Exclusive Interview with Our Newspaper

Bring the fire of our heroic resistance to the world, bring back the noble sympathy from the international community—Li Zhengyao, the Hong Kong student representative who attended the Second World Youth Peace Congress, returned to Hong Kong yesterday.

Representative Li hosted a reception for reporters at the Astor Hotel yesterday at 3:00 PM to report on everything. To express their admiration, guests enthusiastically attended the meeting. Before the meeting, guests crowded together to view the many photos brought by Representative Li. The photos of the atrocities committed by the Japanese aroused our infinite hatred, the heroic resistance of our army aroused our infinite admiration, and the international sympathy aroused our infinite excitement.

During the meeting, Representative Li first gave a speech, followed by Feng Yufang, a design committee member of the Military Affairs Commission's Political Department, who spoke on the importance of national diplomacy. Next, the representative of the Youth Journalists Association expressed their respect and appreciation to Representative Li. Finally, the representative of the Student Federation reported on the general situation of the association. The meeting ended happily around 5:00 PM. The following is a summary of several important matters reported:

The World's Youth Sympathize with Our Resistance Against Japan

Before the meeting, in order to understand the international anti-aggression trends, our newspaper reporter specifically raised several questions to Representative Li. Mr. Li patiently answered, and with his calm and gentle attitude, delivered a speech that was infinitely inspiring. The Second World Youth Peace Congress fully sympathized with our country's heroic resistance against Japan and unanimously opposed the Japanese fascists' aggression. The atmosphere was very tense. Overseas Chinese in New York lit fireworks at the congress, projecting our national flag, a portrait of Chairman Chiang, and the words "Long Live the Republic of China," which won the enthusiastic sympathy and respect of international friends present.

During the meeting, Italy did not have a representative present, but Germany had a representative from a certain group. However, he sympathized with the peace front and opposed his own government's aggressive actions. Japan, on the other hand, actually had five youth representatives of certain groups participating. When the congress unanimously sympathized with our country and condemned Japan, these Japanese military阀 also tried to "argue and defend," but under the universal contempt and ridicule, they had no choice but to bow their heads in dejection before the truth.

The Japanese are quite conspiratorial in the United States, engaging in reactionary propaganda to distort right and wrong. A small number of missionaries have also been bought off, receiving US$250 per propaganda campaign for the Japanese military阀. When Guangzhou fell, it was even more of an opportunity for them to spread rumors and slander. However, because of the solemn attitude of the major American newspapers, intelligent people can distinguish between good and bad, and the Japanese's efforts are only futile.

Signing the Warsaw Pact to Oppose Aggressors

The greatest achievement of the congress was the signing of the historically valuable "Warsaw Peace Pact," the full text of which is attached. This is not just a document; the youth of European and American countries are working hard to make it a reality, such as boycotting Japanese goods, urging their own governments not to assist Japan, helping China with relief efforts, assisting students and refugees in our war zones, and expanding anti-aggression propaganda, all of which are spreading like wildfire. Several groups in various countries are specifically responsible for promoting this movement to resist Japan and aid China. The most active are the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Universities in the United Kingdom and the United States are holding competitions to donate funds to help China, and large sums of money have been flowing into China. The American Student Association also donated forty Red Cross vehicles to China during Christmas. European countries are also imitating and promoting this. The four representatives of the World Student Federation who came to China have been touring the United States, accepting invitations to report on our country's heroic resistance against Japan and giving lectures for more than two months, and have not yet finished. One of the British representatives, Mr. Chuan Lude, repeatedly postponed his wedding date to do his best to promote our country. Since then, international friends have become increasingly hateful of the Japanese and sympathetic to our country.

Anti-Japanese and pro-China propaganda materials from various countries are ubiquitous, and what is commonly found in every corner is a card with the following words: "I don't buy Japanese goods because I don't want to buy bombs for Japan to brutally kill the Chinese people."

The power of this international propaganda is very great. Merchants in various countries refuse to sell Japanese goods, and workers strike against transporting Japanese goods, which is becoming a popular trend.

—Representative Li's conversation with the reporter was truly inspiring. As international sympathy becomes more active, we feel that we should work harder. Darkness will not forever obscure the light, and justice will not forever succumb to power. As long as we persevere in our resistance against Japan, we will surely achieve final victory. Representative Li's return from Europe and the United States has brought us one more true piece of evidence that we will win the war.

Representative Li Addresses the Press

Representative Li delivered a speech to all the guests at the meeting. The following is a summary of the original speech:

Brothers, I have observed that people in European and American countries have expressed warm sympathy for our resistance against Japan and have provided various practical assistance, such as donating funds to relieve refugees, boycotting Japanese goods, and stopping the transportation of military equipment and raw materials to Japan. Both the government and the people are enthusiastically participating in these movements. As for overseas Chinese around the world, they are also working very hard for the national salvation movement. Those with money are certainly contributing money, and even the working masses are actively donating and are not willing to lag behind. For example, many overseas Chinese who work as laundry workers earn barely enough to make a living, but they still save money in hardship and donate every day, long-term donations. This spirit of hard work and struggle is truly inspiring. But there is one point that we must pay attention to, and that is that international propaganda work is still insufficient. In the future, we must expand propaganda on military, political, and other aspects to overseas Chinese to strengthen their understanding of the motherland's resistance against Japan, strengthen their faith, and correct the Japanese's counter-propaganda abroad. For example, during the recent Guangdong war situation, the Japanese created various counter-propaganda abroad.

The result of this conference, that is, the signing of the Warsaw Peace Pact by representatives of forty-seven youth groups, made everyone feel infinitely excited. After the conference, my brothers saw that the young students of various countries were actively implementing the provisions of the pact, and my brothers felt even more gratified. I deeply hope that the young students in Hong Kong and patriotic overseas Chinese will promote this pact with the greatest effort, strive for world peace, and work hard for the motherland's resistance against Japan. My brothers have come abroad this time and are responsible for the task of contacting young people from all over the world. When I went to the United Kingdom and France, I contacted youth groups in various places to discuss methods of mutual contact, and the results were quite satisfactory. In particular, I hope that young students in Hong Kong will work together to maintain world peace, etc.

Written Report Recounts Congress Proceedings

Representative Li issued a written report, the following is a summary: (1) Origin of the World Youth Peace Congress: In 1936, the United Nations Associations and Federations of various countries, in order to promote world peace, sanction aggression, and unite young people from all over the world regardless of race, religion, or political party, to jointly enhance friendship, communicate opinions, and resolve world disputes, specially convened the First World Youth Peace Congress in Geneva. More than 750 representatives from more than 40 countries attended. After the opening of the congress, youth federations were established in 28 countries, and they maintained constant contact, communicated, and advanced and retreated together in the past two years. The Second Congress was held from August 16 to 24 last year at the Warsaw Women's University (New York, USA). The congress discussed matters in four sections: politics, economics, religion, and education. More than 700 representatives from 56 countries attended, and more than 23,000 people visited.

(2) The Chinese Delegation and the Second Congress: The youth of our country have always been a model for the world's youth in the national liberation movement and the struggle against aggression. China sent more than ten people, including Chen Zhutian and Lu Cui, to participate in the first congress. At that time, the sacred resistance war was launched, and the Chinese representatives had a great influence in the conference hall. This year, at the Second Congress, our country, in view of the importance of expanding international propaganda, winning international sympathy and assistance, and jointly sanctioning the Japanese invasion, organized a Chinese delegation to attend the congress. Now, because the mission has been completed, and the Hong Kong student relief association affairs are waiting to be handled, and the school leave has expired, I am rushing to return to the country first. Most of the representatives are still in the western and eastern United States, the United Kingdom, France, etc., staying to continue their propaganda.

Congress Resolution Economic Sanctions

(4) Congress Resolutions: This congress made many resolutions, among which the Warsaw Pact and the following points are the most important:

1.  Stop transporting military supplies and kerosene to supply Japan, and refuse to lend money to Japan.
2.  Governments of all countries should implement a boycott of Japanese goods
3.  The people of all countries should earnestly expand the boycott of Japanese goods movement and promote the purchase of Chinese goods.
4.  International guarantee loan to China to assist China in strengthening national defense and promoting internal construction.

Our country's delegation, led by consultants Zhang Bohu, Zhang Pengchun, Meng Zhi, and head Yang Fuyou, participated in the full group discussions and contacted representatives from various countries, and the results were very satisfactory. The most gratifying thing is that all the representatives sympathize with our country's resistance against Japan (omitted below)

Warsaw Peace Pact Forty-Four Participants

The Warsaw Peace Pact is the culmination of this congress, the full text of which is recorded below:

Article 1: We pledge to promote the spirit of friendship and cooperation among young people of all countries, to work hard to help the young people of our own countries, to unite closely, and to unite with the young people of other countries, regardless of race, creed, or political views, so that they may be united under the leadership of the World Youth Congress movement.

Article 2: We strictly condemn any war of aggression that violates the political independence or territorial sovereignty of another country.

Article 3: We pledge to do everything in our power to ensure that the young people in our country do not participate in wars of aggression against other countries.

Article 4: We agree that when the circumstances require it, we will do our best to urge our national authorities to take joint action with other countries to prevent aggression, to stop aggression that has already occurred, and to provide effective assistance to countries that are damaged by treaties and endangered by aggression. And to ensure that our country does not participate in any aggression, regardless of the form of participation, whether it is supplying the aggressor with war materials or financial assistance, it must be avoided.

Article 5: We solemnly declare that the bombing of undefended cities and civilians is a violation of humanity and internationally accepted rules. We will actively mobilize world opinion to condemn this behavior and assist in the relief efforts for the evacuated.

Article 6: We believe that if justice and fairness are not established internationally and within each country, and if the right to self-determination of some countries and colonies that are seeking freedom is not recognized, there will be no lasting peace. Therefore, we will use peaceful means to correct the unfair phenomena against the people of all countries, regardless of their race, creed, or political views. In our view, political and social justice within our own country, and promote the immediate establishment of international institutions to resolve international disputes by peaceful means.

Signatories include representatives from 47 countries: the United States, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Ecuador, Ireland, Ethiopia, Finland, France, the United Kingdom, Haiti, the Netherlands, India, the Dutch East Indies, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Liberia, Nicaragua, Lithuania, Poland, Palestine, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Honduras, Romania, El Salvador, South Africa, the Gold Coast of West Africa, Spain, Sweden, Syria, Uganda, Uruguay, the West Indies (US), Yugoslavia, etc.

### Entire Congress of Hainanese Overseas Chinese Respectfully Telegrams Chairman Chiang and the Fifth Plenary Session; The Congress Adjourned Yesterday and Will Continue Discussions Today

The Overseas Hainanese Chinese Representatives Congress, scheduled to be held for three consecutive days starting the day before yesterday, was reported by the congress secretariat Zhou Zaibo yesterday that the congress would be adjourned today (i.e., today) and would continue to meet tomorrow (today). Also, the congress sent out four urgent telegrams yesterday, the 23rd, the originals of which are excerpted as follows: (1) To Chairman Chiang in Chongqing: "To Chairman Chiang, leading the resistance war with perseverance and extraordinary achievements, widely loved by the people and admired by all over the world, we respectfully send this telegram"; (2) [Text missing]; (3) To the Fifth Plenary Session: "To the honorable members of the Fifth Plenary Session, respectfully hearing that the elders of the party and the country are discussing national affairs together to strengthen the belief that the resistance war will surely be victorious and to lay the foundation for the establishment of the country will surely be completed, we respectfully send this telegram of support"; (4) To Chen Ce: "To Chongqing Fifth Plenary Session transfer to member Chen Ce Xun, the entire congress urgently awaits guidance on many matters, please return to Hong Kong immediately after the Fifth Plenary Session closes, the entire congress of Hainanese Chinese representatives bows".

### Japanese Spy on French Mail Ship Arrested Upon Leaving Saigon

According to passengers on the French mail ship Félix Roussel, which arrived in Hong Kong from Europe yesterday, a Japanese passenger was arrested by local government officials in Saigon just before the ship set sail for Hong Kong. It is said that the Japanese man had been living there, and his arrest was due to suspicion of espionage.

### Local Discovery of Epidemic Paralysis; No Treatment Equipment Other Than "Iron Lung"

Recently, epidemic paralysis has been discovered in Hong Kong. Two officers of the Hong Kong warship HMS Grampus have contracted the disease in just a few days. Captain Waster of the warship has already been sent to the naval hospital due to paralysis, and his condition is quite serious. Another crew member has also contracted the disease, but his condition is less severe. The number of people in Hong Kong who have epidemic paralysis still needs to be statistically determined after the incubation period of the disease has passed. The commander of the Grampus is currently staying temporarily in the naval hospital, and the crew members have been sent to live in the naval dockyard. They have access to games and entertainment, but cannot contact the outside world to prevent infection. After the dangerous period has passed, they will be able to resume activities. It is known that the most effective treatment equipment for paralysis is the "iron lung." A week ago, the Hong Kong government had already telegraphed the agent of Lord Nuffield of Oxford, requesting the donation of one "iron lung" each for adults and children. However, before receiving the "iron lungs," Hong Kong has no equipment to treat paralysis.

### Japanese Planes Bombing Frequently, Disaster Situation Severe in Various Parts of Guangxi; Guangxi Authorities Request Hong Kong Overseas Chinese to Assist in Relief; Women's Comfort Association Resolves to Donate 5,000 First and Find Ways to Raise Funds; Relief Federation General Assembly Did Not Discuss Relief for Guangxi Yesterday

Huang Xuchu, Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government, yesterday urgently requested the Hong Kong Women's Comfort Association to find ways to help due to the frequent bombing of Guangxi by Japanese planes and the severe disaster situation, and also asked to appeal to various related organizations to jointly launch a righteous act. According to Chairman Huang's report, (1) Japanese planes have bombed 16 counties in the province, totaling more than 50 times, burning down homes and leaving many people homeless and unable to make a living; (2) Refugees entering the province from outside the province have no houses to live in, no way to make a living, and many are displaced; (3) The number of elderly, weak, disabled refugees and orphans in and out of the province is also quite large. Because the provincial treasury has limited financial resources, it has not been able to handle all of the above properly. In addition to previously establishing provincial relief branches to preside over the mobilization of relief matters throughout the province, it has also designated counties in the province's inland water and land transportation areas and along the borders of Hunan and Guangdong provinces to organize relief branches, and the branches have formulated various regulations and measures for relieving refugees in this province and promulgated and implemented them one after another. Recently, it plans to carry out the following matters: (1) It plans to first select sites in counties along the Guiliu Road to build 1,000 temporary simple houses for refugees; (2) Distribute or lend small amounts of money to refugees to enable them to make a living; (3) Build and set up 10 sanatoriums for 100 refugees each in Guilin, Liuzhou, and Xuanshan; (4) Select sites to build and set up 10 orphanages for 100 refugees each; (5) Select sites to build refugee factories 10 factories; (6) Plan to select sites to carry out refugee reclamation projects, setting up 10 refugee reclamation offices. The funds required amount to hundreds of thousands or more. In terms of the current economic situation in the province, it is difficult to carry out all of them. It is hoped that Hong Kong organizations will donate funds to assist in handling them, or directly send personnel to Guangxi to take charge, and the provincial government will provide as much assistance as possible, which is all welcome. Based on this, the Women's Comfort Association immediately submitted it to the standing committee meeting yesterday morning for discussion and decided to donate 5,000 national currency first to help with the urgent needs, and also requested assistance from the Relief Federation, the British Relief Association, and other charitable organizations. In addition, the association also discussed and planned to raise funds for the refugees in Guangxi, and the measures are being planned and will be decided in the near future.

Also, the Hong Kong Joint Relief Association for Refugees in South China held its 32nd member meeting yesterday at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. More than 30 people, including Chairman Zhou Xingchi, attended the meeting and resolved the following proposals: (1) The General Affairs Group requested a donation to the Shanghai Youth Association's Boy Scouts Military Service Corps for a rescue vehicle or two motorcycles. It was decided that when the group sends a letter next time stating what kind of vehicle is needed, it will be discussed again. However, the appropriation is limited to 3,500 yuan or less. (2) Liang Baoren, the magistrate of Baoan County, telegraphed the General Assembly to send representatives to attend the land force rehabilitation meeting to be held in Shenzhen. It was decided to send Lin Peisheng as a representative to attend. It was decided to pass. (3) The Guangxi Emergency Refugee Relief Committee requested an appropriation for relief. It was decided that it would be discussed again when a formal official letter of request was received. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 p.m. A pontoon bridge after the destruction of Huibo Bian.

### A Complete View of the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Dongjiang River (2) – Five of a Travelogue Returning to Hui

— Bai Wei

Feature

The villages along the river connected to Boluo Wei (博羅威) belong to Baizu Ridge (百足嶺). The Xishuiwei (水西尾) area belonging to Hui (惠) was severely burned and devastated, with each village losing 70-80% of its population. Fortunately, up to this point, the area from Xishuiwei to the west of Baizu Ridge remains unharmed. Therefore, during this section of the water journey, one can still lean on the railing and gaze at the sugarcane fields and green fields, a natural and beautiful rural landscape. Although the devilish hands of the × people are many, they will never be able to seize our seven lands. That can always be believed.

Su Village (蘇村), the east bank, and Qiaotou (橋頭) are three market towns located in the middle and lower reaches of the Dongjiang River, standing like a tripod. Fortunately, this time, the × people's invasion of South China, after landing in Huizhou (惠州), focused entirely on land routes, developing along highways or railways. Therefore, although the river route from Huizhou to Shilong (石龍) fell within the enemy's encirclement, only a small number of × soldiers passed through once, managing to avoid the ravages of the × people. At the same time, the × army now entrenched in Shilong (石龍) only disturbs the eastern region. The distance between Dongchuan (東傳) and Dongbo (東博) and these three market towns is still more than twenty li, and they dare not be rampant again amidst our counter-offensive. Therefore, this area can currently be called a paradise. However, we must rebuild this secluded paradise into the vanguard of the Dongjiang River.

Su Village (蘇村) belongs to the third district of Boluo (博羅) and faces Guanghe Market (廣和墟) in Huiyang (惠陽) across the river. The entire market town has just over a hundred shops and is not very large. Before the war, there was a battalion of troops stationed here. For the convenience of transportation, a pontoon bridge was built to connect to Guanghe (廣和) on the other side. When Huizhou (惠州) fell, more than ten × cavalrymen marched straight to Guanghe (廣和) from Jiazi Bu (甲子步) along the Jia-Guang Highway (甲廣公路). The defending troops of Su Village (蘇村) broke the bridge to resist. When the × people realized they could not cross, they returned disappointed, and the Su Village (蘇村) area was preserved. According to the locals, when the × cavalry passed the source of the Guangzhou River (廣州的源頭), two villagers stood by the highway to watch, astonished by the uniqueness of their clothing. They asked if they were the Central Army or ×××. One was beheaded by them, and the other fled into the sugarcane fields. From this anecdote, we deeply feel the inadequacy of political propaganda work in Chinese rural villages. Now, the commercial scene in Su Village (蘇村) is gradually returning to its former state, but the work of administrative self-defense is still far from ideal. This is a problem with the entire structure. It shows that past political reforms in China were only superficial, official bureaucratic exercises. Whether it's the Baojia (保甲) system or other systems, the foundation is still weak. A slight blow makes it difficult to recover. This deserves our attention.

Ten more li downriver from Su Village (蘇村) is Dong'an (東岸), similar in scale to Su Village (蘇村). Because it was not affected by artillery fire, the streets and shops in the market town are still intact. However, due to the rampant banditry and obstructed transportation, business has been much slower. According to the locals, there are four or five incidents of robbery by bandits between Su Village (蘇村) and Dong'an (東岸), at Hejing (何經) and Chilingxia (赤嶺下). When boats pass by, they fire shots to stop them, rob them clean, and then leave howling. Merchants, although rich in the spirit of adventure, are afraid that they will not easily venture out for trade if they have to take multiple risks. However, we didn't see any activity when we came. Perhaps they have already hidden themselves. Afterwards, the reporter met with a local chief there and talked about this situation, offering an idea of joint defense. Like the Xijiang River (西江), the river channel would be divided into several sections, and each section would be defended by nearby villages. He gladly adopted it. On the way back, we met the newly appointed Su Village (蘇村) patrol officer, Chen Boliang (陳伯良), and offered the same suggestion, which he also agreed with. The reporter always hopes that there will be a day when it will be realized. In fact, news from the front and the rear is related. If the rear has three disadvantages, the front will be weakened by one point.

Downriver from Dong'an (東岸) is Tiejiang (鐵江), but due to various difficulties in escorting, we could not go any further. We had to look at it from afar from the riverside of Dong'an (東岸). The vast misty waters and rolling cloud mountains depict the beautiful mountains and rivers of China, and the elegant posture of the Dongjiang River. I still remember that after the enemy occupied Huizhou (惠州), they sent six or seven hundred people downriver by boat, of which two or three hundred were wiped out by the Dongguan (東莞) self-defense corps on the Tiejiang River (鐵江江面). This glorious battle is worth recording, but it is a pity that the reporter could not personally linger there, which is a bit regrettable.

Qiaotou (橋頭) belongs to Dongguan County (東莞縣). To go from Dong'an (東岸), you have to cross the Dongjiang River and then cross a Shahe River (沙河). The locals call it Little Hong Kong (小香港). Although it may be an exaggeration, the market is indeed quite prosperous. The characteristics of a city, such as brothels, teahouses, women's lounges, opium dens, entertainment, and casinos, are mostly available. From here, you can go to Hong Kong via Changping Station (長平站). There are business groups organized and collected by Daji Liu (大鷄六) escorting goods, charging about two yuan per dan of goods for escort fees. Therefore, Qiaotou (橋頭) has now become the main import and export point and economic center of the middle and lower reaches of the Dongjiang River. In this time of national crisis, a hero from the grassroots should, of course, join the fighting ranks. Those who are middle-of-the-road should also protect merchants and maintain local order. Daji Liu (大鷄六) still seems to be a middle-of-the-road figure. At the same time, it should be particularly praised that there are fewer bandits in Dongguan County (東莞縣), which is considered an advantage. (To be continued)

### Hainan Island

— Huang Jingwan (黃警頑)

Hainan Island, China's largest island, formerly known as Qiongya Island (瓊崖島), belongs to Guangdong Province. Originally, Hainan Island was not qualified to receive this honor - China's largest island - because although most of the many islands along China's coast are small in area, the famous sugar-producing Taiwan Island (台灣), opposite Fujian Province, is much larger than it. Unfortunately, this elder brother island was ceded to Japan by the Qing government long ago, so this younger brother is qualified to seize his brother's leading position. Today, it stands alone in the South China Sea. To know what its situation is, I will now observe it from four aspects. Observing Hainan Island from a political perspective.

Observing Hainan Island from a political perspective.

Hainan Island was anciently known as Baiyue (百越). It was not until Qin (秦) pacified Nanyue (南越) that it was included under the jurisdiction of Xiang County (象郡). In the Han Dynasty (漢時), Er'er (耳) and Zhuya (珠崖) counties were established. In the Jin Dynasty (晉時), it belonged to Taipu County (台浦郡). At that time, disaster refugees moved south in droves and drifted to Hainan Island, which was the beginning of our country's immigration to Hainan Island. By the Tang (唐) and Song (宋) dynasties, it had become a sacred place for famous scholars to be exiled. Those who have read Chinese history must know that Su Dongpo (蘇東坡) of the Song Dynasty (宋朝) was exiled to Wanzhou (萬州), and Li Deyu (李德裕) of the Tang Dynasty (唐朝) was demoted to Anzhou (岸州)... But this large island has a lot of fog and rain, the climate is extremely humid, and transportation is inconvenient. Of course, commerce is not developed. Therefore, in the eyes of the general public, it is regarded with the wrong concept of "barren and evil land." Not only was it like this in ancient times, but the former Guangdong Provincial Government (前廣東省政府) often deviated from its norms in its political measures when it ruled, and rarely considered the interests of the islanders and the development of national wealth. Therefore, Hainan Island has a history of more than 2,500 years, and it is a very fortunate and congratulatory thing that it can still maintain the integrity of its territory and the independence of its sovereignty in the dangerous international situation. At present, all the islands in the Pacific Ocean have been eaten away by imperialists in different postures - encroachment, protection. The only surviving Hainan Island has become the target of all imperialists' eyes and fingers. Facts tell us: Hainan Island is already "a storm is coming, the wind fills the building." We should not only actively arm and defend Greater Hainan; but also passively not forget the rapid development of Hainan Island to strengthen our economic fortress.

Observing Hainan Island from a National Defense Perspective

If we look at it from the geographical point of view of national defense, a place that is an important hub of sea and land transportation must have a pivotal influence on national defense. Hainan Island is separated from the Leizhou Peninsula (雷州半島) by the Qiongzhou Strait (瓊州海峽) in the north, faces Borneo (婆羅洲) and the Dutch East Indies' Java (荷屬爪哇) in the south, and borders the Philippine Islands (菲律賓羣島) in the east. The island has an area of more than 33,700 square kilometers, divided into sixteen counties. Mount Limu (黎母山) stands in the center, and the island is narrow and long. It is an important base for the navy and a must-pass place for the East Asian route. Taiwan (合灣) and Hainan (海南) islands are the two eyes of China's southeast. Now that one eye has been lost, at least he should not be blinded in both eyes. The Yulin Port (楡林港) on the island can be used as a very good telegram port for national defense, because it is the first gateway for Europe to sail east. History has proved the certainty of this sentence (During the Russo-Japanese War, the Baltic Fleet berthed here.) A Japanese naval colonel once "praised" Hainan Island as Japan's lifeline. He said, "Hainan Island is the base for operations against Guangdong and Guangxi (兩廣). If Japan can control Yulin Port (楡林港) as a military port and concentrate all the excellent fleets here, he can immediately take the initiative in the local situation. It can not only contain China's South China Sea, but also reduce the military value of Hong Kong, indirectly depriving the British of their interests in the Far East, making the French fleet in Xaigon (刹衣港) sigh at the sea, and the voyage of the American elite fleet also become his urn, so Japan controls the sea power of the outer South Seas, and of course can regard himself as the leader of the East." The National Father Sun Zhongli (孫總理) had long been aware of this, so in his National Construction Strategy (建國方略), he planned to develop this port as a military port in southern China. Observing the overall situation of the island, it is indeed a very important base in the Pacific Ocean and the gateway to protect South China in the current Sino-Japanese War!

Observing Hainan Island from an Economic Perspective

Hainan Island, which the Chinese people call "barren and evil land," is indeed an uncultivated virgin land. In terms of agriculture, because the climate is suitable and the natural lands are exceptionally fertile, most of the islanders live by farming. Tropical plants such as areca, coconut, rubber, and banana have amazing outputs every year. These outputs are not only the main raw materials in industry, but also indispensable raw materials in military chemical industry. In addition, the output of daily necessities, such as rice, sugarcane, peanuts, coffee, tea, beans, and tobacco, is also very rich. As for minerals, copper, silver, iron, tin, lead, etc. are produced. Because there is no sufficient capital, these natural treasures have not been fully exploited. In addition, animal husbandry, on which most islanders rely for their livelihoods, and the annual exports of cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, etc., have become Hong Kong's only imports, and the output has become an important industry in Hainan Island. Also, because it is surrounded by the sea, the rich fishing grounds are spread all over the place. Although the fishing methods are immature and there is competition from Japanese fishing boats, the output is still very considerable. To sum up, if we can fully develop Hainan Island, the position of China's largest island will definitely be able to keep pace with Taiwan.

Observing Hainan Island from a Cultural Perspective

The residents of the entire island can be divided into two types: about 1.8 million Han Chinese and 960,000 barbarian Han Chinese. Most of the Han Chinese are from Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, and a few from Zhejiang. The barbarian people are divided into raw Li (生黎), Miao Li (苗黎), Li (黎), and Qi Li (歧黎). The distribution of the population is centered on Qiongzhou (瓊州). The Han Chinese mostly live in the plains, and the Li people, except for a few who belong to the water, mostly live in the deep mountains and are extremely barbaric and have no culture at all. The language is of course extremely complicated. It is said that to live on the island, you must be able to understand at least five or six languages, otherwise you will feel very difficult. Local residents are ignorant, and the simplicity of the villagers' minds, the shallowness of knowledge, the corruption of consciousness, and the rudeness of actions all make people sigh and worry. The work of saving the country is not from top to bottom. "Hundreds of millions of ignorant people are called no people." It is not only "no people," but often easily becomes "rebellious people" because these people are most easily bought and used by the × people, and even do not realize that they are traitors. When the Chinese nation is at its most critical moment, we should cherish every bit of financial and human resources and not let them be wasted or abandoned. Then, the 2.4 million human resources on Hainan Island, do we just abandon them in vain?

Protect Greater Hainan, Develop Greater Hainan.

### The Navigation of Each Port from Changjiang (长江) to Rugao (如皋) is Monopolized by ×

[Rugao (如皋) Communication] Since Tongru (通如) fell into the enemy's hands, Xinsheng (新生), Zhanghuang (張　), Tiansheng (天生), each port has been occupied by the Japanese army. Only merchants are allowed to enter and exit through Niantuo (碾陀), Xiaoli (小李), Siyu (絲　), each port where the Chinese army is stationed. The Japanese army is determined to operate Xinsheng (新生) and Zhanghuang (張黃) ports to lure merchants, and from time to time burn the passengers and goods of the port army's stationed ports with steamships, using inducement and coercion. They also burned Zhouxu Port (周墟港) last month, intending to force all passengers and goods to enter and exit through the Xinzhang (新張) ports to increase tax revenue. On the 14th of this month, around dawn, more than 100 Japanese troops pushed westward from Nantong Pingchao (南通平潮), first occupying Wujie Bridge (五節橋), and then occupying Niantuo (碾陀) and Siyu (絲漁) ports, and stationed around Yingfang Port (營防港), carrying many steel cannons and military supplies, and indiscriminately fired guns to show off their power. Residents fled in droves. The guerrillas, with a disparity in forces, guarded the four suburbs and waited for an opportunity to counterattack. It is heard that the Japanese army is digging trenches and building fortifications at Niantuo Port (碾陀港) and other places, and has not burned civilian houses, seemingly intending to station there permanently. If they occupy it for a long time and do not leave, then there will be no place for each port of Tongru (通如) to safely enter and exit, and the navigation will almost all fall into the hands of the Japanese. On the 15th, the British merchant ship Huangpu (黃浦) sailed from Shanghai, but because of the chaos along the river, it was inconvenient to unload and load, so it returned to Zhong (中) with the passengers and goods on the original ship, taking the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway (浙贛鐵路) to Lanzhou (蘭州). Which sections of the entire line are highways? Which sections are trains? What are the starting and ending place names and the minimum fares for each section? Are there any expensive branches in each place it passes through, and how much are the fees? Si Pantai Feng (四潘泰封)

### Guangxi Province Highway (4)

— Pan Taidui (潘泰對)

And its Scenery along the Route

Yishan (宜山) is 119 kilometers from Liuzhou (柳州) and 70 kilometers from Datang (大塘). The city is located on the south bank of the Liujiang River (柳江), and its shape is like a boat. The land outside the city is flat, with small stones stretching for dozens of miles, like iron chains tying the boat. There are many famous scenic spots nearby. To the north is Beishan (北山), also known as Huixianyuan (會仙由). There is a stone dragon in the Bailong Cave (白龍洞) on it, which is where Lu Xiting (陸西亭) of Hedong (河東) walked in the late Tang Dynasty (唐末). Jinxiange Pavilion (金仙閣) next to the mountain, red and green trees, birds and flowers, has the interest of odd stones. To the south is Nanshan (南山). The stones of Longyindong Cave (龍隱洞) are smooth, and the scales and armor are clearly visible. In front of the cave, the Buddhist temple Qing'an (淸庵) is quite spacious. Yanglou (陽樓) is in Nanshan Temple (南山寺), deep forest and daylight pavilion, the evening bell, rising with the meaning of things outside. To the west is Xiangshan Temple (香山寺), with strange rocks and various shapes. The Eight Views are Fantianmen (梵天門), Guanyinge Pavilion (觀音閣), Chaotianshi Stone (朝天石), Randengmen Gate (燃燈門), Putuo Shore (普陀岸), Putilu Road (菩提路), Diyunting Pavilion (滴雲亭), and Xiyunxiu Mountain (噓雲岫), all of which are wonders. Outside Xiguan (西關) is the Huangshangu Yiguan Tomb (黃山谷衣冠墓), with stone rafts surrounding the tomb. Hechi (河池) is 92 kilometers west of Yishan (宜山) and 221 kilometers from Liuzhou (柳州). It is a lodging station on the Liuer Section (柳二段) of the Southwest Highway. Nandan (南丹) is 56 kilometers northwest of Hechi (河池) and 277 kilometers from Liuzhou (柳州). Before the highway was opened, this was a barbarian land. It is surrounded by mountains, all of which are protruding and steep, with strange shapes, producing sweet potatoes, corn, etc. Near the border with Hechi (河池), there is tin ore, but the reserves are not large.

Liuan (六案) is located at the junction of Guizhou (黔) and Guangxi (桂), 52 kilometers from Nandan (南丹), in the mountains. There is a park in the south, which was opened by the garrison. There are many nearby, and every time the furnace is lit, they carry local products here to exchange for the missing, just like the ancient legacy.

5. Liuzhang Line (柳長錢) runs north from Liuzhou (柳州) to Chang'an (長安), a total of 115 kilometers, passing through Changtang (長塘), Shatang (沙塘), Shipaiping (石牌坪), Shanglei (上雷), Shapu (沙浦), Taiping (太平), Daliang (大良), Shaping (沙坪), Dongjiang (東江), Fushi (浮石), and ten stations. Construction began in December of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China (民國十五年) after surveying in September, and was completed and opened to traffic in October of the seventeenth year of the Republic of China (民國十七年). The beams are divided into stone and brick arch bridges and stone and brick pier support standard board bridges. There are 43 degrees, and 351 culverts. The maximum slope is 8%, and the minimum radius of the curve is 40 meters.

There are no large cities along this route, and the industry and commerce are not developed. Fushi (浮石) is 103 kilometers from Zizhou (州). To its west is Rong County (融縣), with the scenic spots of Zhenxianyan Rock (眞仙岩), Wuhua Rock (五華岩), and Yunjishan Mountain (雲際山). Zhenxianyan Rock (眞仙岩) was originally named Lingyan Mountain (靈岩山). There is a Laojun Cave (老君洞) on it, which is 20 zhang high. There is a stone carving of Laojun (老君). Lingshou Stream (靈壽溪) runs through it. There are inscriptions from the Song Yuanyou Party (宋元佑黨) and many stone carvings from former sages at the cliff. Wuhua Rock (五華岩) has two stones, one lying like a tiger and one winding like a dragon, called Longyinhushi Stone (龍吟虎　石). Zhixi Creek (至華溪) flows down, and Carp Rock (鯉魚岩) stands to the right. Luoquan (邏壑深泉) adds to the coldness and beauty. Yunjishan Mountain (雲際山) is majestic and tall. There are two springs on it, Cuiyu (翠玉) and Hanbi (寒碧), which are also beautiful. Chang'an (長安) produces tung oil, tea oil, and fir wood is mostly used for wood. Liushi Line (柳石綫) runs south from Liuzhou (柳州) to Shilong (石龍), a total of 52 kilometers, passing through Yangjiaoshan Bridge (羊角山大橋), Sifangtang (四方塘), Chuanshan (穿山), Mushan (木山), and Zhongtuan (中團) six stations. It was built between the fourteenth and fifteenth years of the Republic of China (民國十四十五年). There are 14 bridges, 9 semi-permanent and 5 permanent. There are 66 culverts, mostly temporary. The maximum slope is 8%, and there are not many roads, and the minimum radius is 50 kilometers. The road surface is paved with gravel.

Shilong is a port city in Xiang County (象縣), located on the north bank of the Liujiang River (柳江). The electric boat can reach Wuzhou (梧州) in two days, so cargo merchants often load goods in Wuzhou (梧州), take the waterway to Shi (石), and then load the trucks to Liuzhou (柳州) by highway, which can be reached in three hours. Although it takes more time than directly shipping to Liuzhou (柳州) by car from Wuzhou (梧州), it is more cost-effective in terms of shipping costs.

C. Centered on Yulin (鬰林)

Yulin (鬱林), also known as Yulin (玉林), is located in southern Guangxi (廣西), on the left side of Goulu Mountain (勾漏山), and is the commercial center of Miaolin (謬林), Bai (白), Beiliu (北流), Luchuan (陸川), and Xingye (興業) five counties. There is the South Canal (南運河) waterway to Beihai (北海) in Guangdong. All products in the Qinlian (欽廉) area are transported to Yu (鬰) through this canal to be transferred to various places. The most prosperous industry is the local 2 industry. According to statistics, there are about 1,000 weaving households and 2,000 looms in the county, with an annual output of 300,000 pieces. In addition to self-use, they can also be sold abroad. Its quality is more refined than Guilin cloth. The main agricultural product is rice, which is transported by waterway. In addition, tangerines, oranges, plums, etc. are also produced. The famous scenic spots are Zhitang Ridge (豸堂嶺). The Beidi Temple (北帝廟) on the ridge was built in the Song Dynasty (宋代) and rebuilt during the Qing Jiaqing period (淸嘉慶間). There is a tower called Gu Wanhualou Tower (古萬花樓). Zhuoying Spring (濯纓泉) is on the Nanliu Binhai River (南流濱江). Huge stones protrude, and the spring is gushing. Looking from a distance, it looks like silk. A little farther from the city, to the northeast is Hanshan Mountain (寒山), and below is Longtan Pond (龍潭). There is a Feilaishi Stone (飛來石) on the side of the pond, inscribed with the four characters "Ganying Longshen (感應龍神)". It produces small bamboo, which is less than a foot high. It withers when transplanted. Different species. Directly north is the Waterfall Spring (瀑布泉). The waterfall rushes down from the top of the mountain, with a white silk hanging in the air, reaching dozens of zhang. To the northwest is Yinxianyan Rock (隱仙岩), which is a separate trunk of Hanshan Mountain (寒山). It is dense and beautiful. There is a stone guest with an area of several mu in the middle, and the stone milk is all over the county, full of beautiful things. There are human footprints on the stone, and no moss grows, which is called "Stone Chamber Fairy Trail (石室仙蹤)".

The highways starting from Yulin (鬱林) include Yuwu Line (鬱梧), Liuyu Line (柳鬱), Yongyu Line (邕鬱), Yushi Line (鬱石), and Yubo Line (鬱博). In addition, the Guigui Line (貴桂線) starts from Guixian County (貴縣), and the Rongwu Line (容武線) starts from Rong County (容縣).

1. Yuwu Line (鬱梧綫) runs northwest from Yulin (鬱林) to Xinzhen Market (　墟), which is across the river from Wuzhou (梧州), passing through Xinxu (新墟), Beiliu (北流), Xishan (西山), Rong County (容縣), Shi (石　), 　yin (　蔭), Youma (油蔴), Liuwang (六旺), Pangu (盤古), Nandu (南渡), Malu (馬路), 　cun (　村), Cenxi (岑溪), Liuyun (六云), Shahe (沙河), Nuo (糯　), Taiping (太平), Hui (迴), Xinpu (新舖), Xindi (新地), Guling (古嶺), and Tipu (題舖) twenty-two stations, with a total length of 210 kilometers, 138 bridges, 59 of which are permanent, and culverts are all permanent, totaling 653 degrees. It is built in three sections. The first section is from Yulin (鬰林) to Beiliu (北流), 34 kilometers, completed in the 16th year of the Republic of China (民國十六年). There are dense populations along the route, and there are only three or four bridges. Except for the Zhuoyi Gorge (朱衣峽) section, which is relatively high and steep, the rest are straight and flat, and the car travels steadily. The second section is from Beipu (北浦) to Rong County (容縣), a total of 34 kilometers. It began in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China (民國十三年), and was opened to traffic in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (民國十六年). However, due to insufficient filling, the roadbed collapses when it rains. It was returned to the business community in the ninth year (上九年), but no processing was done. It was taken back in the twenty-first year (二十一年), and re-repaired, filled the roadbed, and paved with sandstone and gravel, and the wooden bridges were replaced, which was improved. The third section is from Rong County (容縣) to Wuzhou (梧州), 172 kilometers long, built in the 15th year of the Republic of China (民國十五年), and sandstone was added later in the 21st year (二十一年). There are many mountains and small valleys along the route, such as Xiaotang'ao (小塘拗), Lulingjie (綠靈界), and Niu'aojie (牛　界), and the slope is very large, increasing to 10%.

Before the Guangdong Incident (粵變), those who entered the southwest from Hong Kong mostly followed the waterway to Wuzhou (梧州) first, and then went west along this line. At that time, the Yuwu Road (鬱梧道) was quite prosperous. Today, the Hong Kong-Wuzhou Road (港梧路) is blocked, and Wuzhou (梧州) has become a dead city. The passenger and freight transportation on this line has plummeted. I sincerely cannot bear the feeling of today and yesterday.

### Our Ministry of Finance is Determined to Maintain Creditworthiness; Unified and Reconstructive Bonds Will Be Paid in Full as Usual

The Ministry of Finance is determined to maintain its creditworthiness. The National Debt Fund Management Committee will continue to conduct drawings for principal repayment as usual. The Unified Bonds maturing at the end of this month and the Reconstructive Bonds maturing at the end of February will be fully paid in Chongqing. Over the past year, customs revenue has not decreased significantly. Although there are dedicated funds that have not been allocated, the government is still accommodating overdrafts, demonstrating its full creditworthiness. This has attracted a wave of international sentiment. Compared with the Japanese seizure of tax revenue, it further highlights the government's great attitude. Bonds have dedicated funds, unlike those with guarantees but insufficient income. Moreover, there are substantial dedicated funds accumulated due to guarantees. Therefore, the government's recent cessation of accommodating overdrafts is a common practice. Since the British and Japanese sides announced the customs agreement, transferring tax revenue to the Japanese side, our government has lodged a protest with Britain, resulting in the lack of some bond interest funds today. Chinese and foreign individuals should be aware of this and know where the responsibility lies. The government's response to this situation is very appropriate. In addition to notifying that no further overdrafts will be accommodated for debts guaranteed by customs revenue, it also declared that for all long-term debts guaranteed by customs revenue borrowed before the war and not yet repaid, the proportion of customs revenue outside the war zone will be allocated to the Central Bank on a regular basis for dedicated storage. It also stated that when customs offices in the war zone remit the already stored and owed debt repayment funds and subsequent tax revenue according to the original ratio to the Inspectorate General of Customs, the debt and indemnity funds will still be allocated. This further demonstrates the government's attitude of maintaining creditworthiness. Regarding the lottery repayment of domestic debt, the National Debt Fund Management Committee will continue to hold them as usual. The public bonds to be drawn on February 10 are Class A bonds of the Unified Bonds. The Class A, B, C, D, and E bonds of the Unified Bonds maturing on January 31, as well as the principal and interest of the Reconstructive Bonds maturing on February 28. As for the repayment method for the interest of 412.875 yuan and the principal of 1,125,000 yuan of the Financial Loan Bonds of the Republic of China Year 17 maturing on March 31, no orders have yet been received by the Ministry.

### South China's Southern Expedition Team: Performance After Landing at Haiphong; Return Delayed, Arriving in Hong Kong on the 27th

(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Although the South China football team did not achieve complete victory in this expedition, the results were still satisfactory. It is noted that the team returned from Phnom Penh to Cochinchina on the 20th, and played another match with the Cochinchina First Team on the 21st. They departed on the 23rd and were originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow.

Yesterday, we received an airmail letter from Team Leader Mok, stating that the team would not be able to return to Hong Kong until the 27th. When the team was competing in Cochinchina, our consul stationed in Haiphong made a special trip to Cochinchina to contact the team, saying that the local overseas Chinese very much hoped that the South China team would land in Haiphong on their way back and put on a performance match to satisfy the overseas Chinese's eagerness. The team, seeing the overseas Chinese in Haiphong's such love and support, found it difficult to refuse, and agreed to the request. Therefore, they will be landing in Haiphong for a competition on their way back and staying for one night, thus delaying the return and requiring them to return to Hong Kong on the 27th.

### Alice Marble's Secrets to Tennis Success (1)

— Translated by an Old Friend of the Court

Speaking of the current state of sports in our country, the men's sector is certainly behind, but the women's sector is even further behind. Leaving aside other sports, taking tennis, which is suitable for both men and women, as an example, it has already made concerned people feel that active training is a must. For example, the recently concluded Hong Kong Women's Open Tennis Competition was somewhat disappointing for concerned people. Compared to the Westerners, aren't the Chinese people in Hong Kong outnumbered by a ratio that someone once used as 97 to 3? In that huge difference of 97 to 3, and when many talents gathered, statistically speaking in the women's tennis singles and doubles matches, the crowd of 97 percent couldn't beat the mere 3 percent, and only got half a championship (referring to Madam Chiu Chun Chiu partnering with a Western woman to win the doubles title). This is truly shameful.

There are very few educational materials in our country, especially writings on tennis, which are very scarce. Therefore, there is a great lack of women's tennis talent. Among them, if one can be active in society and get guidance from male tennis players, or if one's English proficiency is sufficient to find Western teaching materials to read and study, one can still hope to play properly. Otherwise, even if one plays for fun in schools with tennis courts, it's just playing around. It's already difficult to ask for proper playing methods and steps, let alone progress, and even more impossible to hope to jump into the international tennis scene. Therefore, based on the purpose of promoting sports, I am willing to find some writings on women's tennis to translate, in order to create opportunities for those sisters who are seeking to improve in ball games.

### Tonight's Women's Basketball Game

There are three women's basketball games at the YMCA tonight at 6:30 pm. This is the last time they will be held after the establishment of the new league. After these three games, the entire season will end. Tonight's first game is between Mui Fong and Paul. Mui Fong has been invincible since the start of the league. Paul is a weak team in this year's competition. Tonight, when facing the strong Mui Fong, they will definitely be defeated. The second game is between Snowflakes and Southwest, with Southwest expected to win. The third game is between Sze Sze and South China. Although Sze Sze's strength is not as good as South China's, Sze Sze has improved, so South China will not win easily.

### Inter-School Table Tennis: Kowloon Wins Final Victory

The inter-school table tennis competition organized by the Wah Keung Sports Association: the match between Ho Lam and Kowloon the night before last, due to the strong strength of both sides, was very intense. The match lasted until 11 PM before the outcome was decided. As a result, Kowloon barely won by three to two. The most intense of the five group matches was Lai Siu-Hon vs. Chung Chak-Yung. After a hard-fought three games, each game differed by only two or three points. Fortunately, Siu-Hon won with a score of two to one, securing Kowloon's victory.

Now that Kowloon has defeated Ho Lam, if they can buy Yongyim, Kekong and Kwongda tomorrow night, the championship will be theirs. However, Kwongda's strength is not weak and will not be easy to defeat. The competition venue is still at the Confucius Society, with a ticket price of two corners. All proceeds will be donated to the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Rescue Corps. The recent results of each team are as follows:

(Team Name) Matches Wins Losses Points

Kowloon College 4 4 0 4

Ho Lam Middle School 4 3 1 3

Kwongda Accounting 3 3 0 3

Queen's College 4 2 2 2

Kowloon Ho Lam Divided 5 1 4 1

### Movies and Theater

Entertainment... Beg, Borrow or Steal

Beg, Borrow or Steal is a crazy comedy about a high-class son who always says outlandish things. Once, he boasted to his wife and daughter that he had bought a villa in the Riviera. Unexpectedly, his wife and daughter took the unintentional lie as truth. It happened that his daughter was getting married and planned to hold the wedding in the villa. Because the son's words were still in their ears and he did not want to hurt his beloved daughter's feelings, he had no choice but to borrow a villa from someone to temporarily act the part of a rich man. At the same time, he also invited a group of good brothers to impersonate important guests. Later, he was surrounded by those he had cheated and monitored by the police. At the same time, his daughter discovered that she had fallen in love with the wrong person, making things worse. When he couldn't maintain it anymore, he bravely exposed his own secrets for the sake of his daughter.

Frank Morgan's skilled and experienced acting produced a lot of laughter. The performances of the male and female leads, John Beal and Florence Rice, in the two-sex pursuit also added a lot of romantic fun. In short, this film is an entertaining work.

Eastern... You're Only Young Once

This is a very meaningful film that gives young men and women enlightenment on love. The story is very simple, depicting a very happy family. The head of the family is a just and wise judge with a son and a daughter, both in their youth. When they went to California as a family, his children all went astray in complex love affairs. Fortunately, their father painstakingly corrected them and rescued them from dangerous situations.

In terms of actors, Louis Stone is certainly the most successful. His portrayal of the psychology of young people in love is very clear, and his own sincere attitude is also well outlined. Shirley Temple and Mickey Rooney are also very good.

Queen... Touchdown, Army

This film is mostly set in the US West Point Military Academy, showing its strict discipline and neat meeting areas. It also interspersed a triangular romantic comedy, and concluded with a tense and lively football match. This kind of story is not new, but the overall performance of the play is quite successful.

The content describes a frivolous playboy who is willing to enter military school for a woman, enduring all kinds of hardships. Unexpectedly, this woman's heart already belongs to someone else. Later, because of his superb football skills, he makes a great splash and wins the woman's favor.

The football matches and meeting scenes in the film are mostly edited from newsreels, but because of the skillful technique, they do not show any traces. John Wayne plays a small instructor in the film and is not as brilliant as he is in detective films.

Ping On... White Banners

Adapted from the recent work "White Banners" by the great writer Lloyd C. Douglas, the story itself is very meaningful. The script is well-written and the allocation of actors is also appropriate. The overall performance is very moving. The plot is very ethical. It may not be of interest to ordinary people. But if you are patient to look further you will find this worthwhile.

Claude Rains has always had great success in his performances. This time he plays a teacher who loves his job, and his performance is very insightful. In addition, several supporting actors, such as Fay Bainter, Jackie Cooper, and Bobby Jordan, as well as the child Bennie Bartlett, who has always played villain roles, change their style and play a passionate young man, are all excellent and satisfying.

Great China... The Little Tough Guy

This film features a group of naughty kids from the slums. There are two very talented actors but neither appear in this film. The plot is roughly the same as previous works. A group of naughty kids are eventually arrested and sent to a reformatory to be reformed. The performance is also relatively poor.

King Sing... Things to Come

Central... The Pearl Shirt

It was not long after the death of Richard Talmadge of Hollywood that there was a Chinese version of Richard Talmadge. This kind of speculative method does not require the effort of publicity and can reap the benefits of publicity. The cleverness of Chinese filmmakers can be seen from this. However, the arrangement of the content story of this film is not exhaustive. At the same time, the tense scenes also failed to be fully developed. The depiction of the behavior and actions of bandits is more of a failure than a success. The allocation of actors is also not very suitable. Apart from Liu Qiong, who has considerable success, Gu Lan-Chun and Hong-Jing-Ling didn’t have much presence. Xu Huayuan's Richard Talmadge-like facial makeup is quite similar, but the imitation of the action aspect is yet to be seen.

### Amidst Public Outrage: South China Defeats Ke Police United Team; Field Patrolman Enters Field and Assaults South China Player; Order Disrupted, Patrolman Removed from Field

(Saigon Special Dispatch) The South China team's defeat to the Southern Ky team last Sunday has deeply saddened the overseas Chinese. It was truly due to their relentless efforts and extreme fatigue, allowing the well-rested opponents to take advantage. It was certainly not their fault. Considering that they were able to defeat the Ke Do Heng Police United team last night, the 15th, with an incomplete team, we can expect great hope for their upcoming match against the Southern Ky team on Saturday, which is a fundraising event. It is understood that the Ke Do Heng and Police teams are the champions of this area and are also skilled in night matches. Furthermore, six of their players were from the Southern Ky team of the previous Sunday, showing that the difference in skill is not too significant.

The stone stadium was still full that night, although not as crowded as the previous Sunday. South China and the United team entered amidst applause from the crowd. The lineup for the night was as follows:

South China

Cheung Wing-choi, Lee Tin-sang, Lee Kwok-wai, Lam Tak-po, Lau Hing-choi, Lau Tin-sun (replaced by Tse Kam-hung), Law Tau-man, Lau Chung-sang, Chan Tak-fai, Fung King-cheung, Tang Kwong-sum (replaced by Yeung Shui-yik)

United Team

Ah Bin, Ah Che, Ah Lung, Ah Yat, Ba Si Ni, Ah Man, Ah Tai, Ah Tin, Ah Tok, Ah Bun, Ah Man

The silver whistle blew.

The United Team took the offensive.

In just three minutes, Ah Tok received the ball and passed it. As the ball approached the goal, at this critical moment, Tin-sang slid and hooked the ball, sending it to the right. Unfortunately, Ah Tai was there and kicked it in from only a few feet away. South China fell behind, with the score at 1-0. In the second half, the United Team continued its offensive. After ten minutes of chaotic play, Ah Tai got the ball and kicked it with great speed. Cheung Wing-choi managed to block the ball, sending it out of bounds, resulting in a corner kick. However, Wing-choi also blocked that. After South China narrowly escaped danger, they went straight to the enemy's territory. When they reached the enemy's goal, Tang Kwong-sum kicked the ball, sending up a cloud of dust, and the enemy goalkeeper fell. Unfortunately, the aim was not accurate, and the ball went past the goal. The enemy goalkeeper then kicked it out. The enemy forces launched a counterattack, reaching the South China territory, only five feet away from the goal. It was extremely dangerous, but Tin-sang managed to slide and kick the ball out of bounds, resulting in a corner kick. After a period of chaotic play, Wing-choi caught the ball. At this time, Ah Tok's foot was slightly injured but he was still able to play. Soon, the ball was taken to the enemy's territory by the South China team, only an inch away from the goal. Lau Chung-sang kicked, but it was too weak and was blocked by Ah Che, who launched a counterattack towards the South China side. South China was then penalized with a corner kick, but Wing-choi managed to catch the ball.

After a Long Struggle,

The Enemy Cavalry Invaded Again

Ah Tok, only twelve feet away from the goal, passed to Ah Tai. At this moment, the audience held their breath, thinking that South China would certainly concede this goal. Unexpectedly, Ah Tai kicked the ball too high, averting the danger. The South China players then seized the opportunity to counterattack, threatening the enemy's goal. However, both times King-cheung and Lau Chung-sang kicked, the goalkeeper caught the ball. Soon, the enemy pressed forward again. Only ten feet away from the goal, Ah Man passed to Ah Tai, attempting a solo effort. Unexpectedly, Chung-sang shouted and charged forward, kicking the ball out of bounds. King-cheung caught the ball and dribbled it all the way to the enemy territory, passing it to Chung-sang. Chung-sang kicked the ball, but it was blocked by Ah Lung's head. Tang Kwong-sum quickly caught the ball and passed it to King-cheung, who then passed it to Tak-fai. Unfortunately, he couldn't get a good foot on it and kicked it too slowly. The goalkeeper caught the ball again. However, King-cheung regained possession and passed it to Tak-fai, who passed it to Kwong-sum. He kicked it straight in. Although the enemy goalkeeper blocked it, the ball bounced out of bounds, resulting in a corner kick, which was taken by Kwong-sum. As the ball reached the goal, King-cheung jumped up and headed it into the net. South China scored a goal, tying the score. It was about twenty minutes after the kickoff.

Regaining Lost Ground,

South China's Morale Soared

Each player showed their skills. King-cheung turned left and right, making the enemy run tirelessly. Then, Law Tau-man dribbled, making the enemy chase him with sweat pouring down their backs. The audience applauded loudly. Later, King-cheung kicked two balls and had a corner kick, but none hit the target. Soon, Lau Tin-sun got the ball and passed it to King-cheung, who then passed it to Tak-fai. The ball was at the feet of the famous player, with only mud and no ball visible. When the enemy goalkeeper turned around, the ball was already in the net. South China scored another goal. Soon, it was lemon time, and the first half ended with a score of 2-1, with South China leading.

After the lemon break, the enemy blamed the ball and insisted on changing it before resuming the match. After about ten minutes of chaotic play, Ah Man missed two shots. However, these two shots were the most dangerous of the entire match. One was only a few feet away from the goal, and Wing-choi had already fallen. The ball went past the goalpost. The other hit the crossbar and bounced to the ground, rolling out of bounds in front of Wing-choi. The speed of the ball was like a swift arrow, extremely dangerous. Later, the enemy cavalry launched a fierce attack on South China's goal. Only a few feet away from the goal, Tin-sang went up to block the enemy's path. This was usually a common occurrence, but the referee was influenced by the

Audience,

Obeying the Audience's Wishes

After the referee asked the linesman, he intended to award a corner kick. Unexpectedly, the audience disagreed and shouted for a free kick. The referee then changed the corner kick to a free kick. The opponent thought they would certainly score. Unexpectedly, a divine general stood guard, invincible. Wing-choi blocked the ball, and it bounced off the crossbar and out of the net, resulting in another corner kick, which was also unsuccessful. In an instant, South China was penalized with another free kick, which was taken by Ah Tok. Despite his intelligence, there was a lapse, and South China conceded this goal, making the score 2-2. The audience was extremely angry at this time. Soon, the enemy attacked again, reaching the South China goal. Wing-choi came out to meet them, slightly touching Ah Tai. Unexpectedly, the opponent became angry out of shame and attacked Wing-choi. The linesman on the right even broke the rules by entering the field to cause trouble and tried to beat Chung-sang. At this time, the audience had reached the limit of their endurance.

Great Disorder,

People Rushed into the Field to Fight

After mediation by Chinese and Western individuals, the linesman was finally dismissed and removed from the field. Order was then restored, and the game resumed. The South China players bravely advanced. Tak-fai kicked the ball, and before the dust settled, the ball was already in the net, making the score 3-2. The ball was moved, and the battle continued. The ball was again dribbled by the enemy cavalry. Only ten feet away from the South China goal, Ah Man kicked the ball, but it was blocked by Wing-choi, resulting in a corner kick, which was also unsuccessful. Soon, King-cheung got the opportunity and passed it to Shui-yik. Shui-yik went straight in and kicked the ball, making the score 4-2. In the last few minutes, the enemy repeatedly pressed on South China's territory. On one occasion, Ah Tok went straight in, but Tin-sang couldn't catch up. He kicked the ball from only a few feet away from the goal, but it was blocked by Wing-choi. The opponents sighed. On another occasion, Ah Tok got the ball and passed it to Ah Man. At this time, Ah Man was alone, only a few feet away from the goal. Unexpectedly, the ball came unexpectedly and hit his left foot, slowly rolling away. Wing-choi caught it almost effortlessly. Ah Man could only stomp his feet in frustration. Afterwards, the game continued back and forth, with nothing remarkable to record. Soon, time was up, and South China celebrated its victory again with a score of 4-2. (Zhu Zhaoheng Special)

### Self-Strengthening Sports Association: Tao Xingzhi's Speech

The Red Self-Strengthening Sports Association invited educator and National Political Council member Dr. Tao Xingzhi to give a speech last night. The topic was "The Newly Established Situation of the War of Resistance and Workers' Education." Dr. Tao's speech was simple and easy to understand, and he was well-prepared. It was both serious and humorous, and the audience was very excited. His analysis of the new phase of the War of Resistance was especially detailed. The meeting ended around 8 o'clock.

### The Lost Writings of Qifeng

— Yun Jun

— A Note on a National Novel

The Lost Writings of Qifeng, which was included in the first compilation of the Garden of Stories in Xianyang, has recently been published as a separate volume. The book was written by the Qifeng Woodcutter. The author's own preface does not reveal anything about his life. Although the entire book has sixty chapters, each chapter only has a few hundred words, with the shortest being only two hundred words, such as the third chapter, and the longest being only a little over a thousand words, such as the fourteenth, fifty-third, and fifty-fourth chapters. This is quite different from the usual long novels with chapters. The scope covered in the book is quite broad, but it lacks organization, making it seem like miscellaneous notes. According to Sun Kai's "Supplement and Correction" to the Bibliography of Chinese Popular Novels, it is "similar to the Miscellaneous Records of the Sea Corner, which records events in literary Chinese." The book mainly focuses on the beginning and end of the resistance against the Qing people's hair-shaving order and the organization of the militia in Changshu and Fushan. It also briefly narrates the events of the Hongguang Dynasty in Nanjing (chapters 12) and the popular uprisings sparked by the same incident in the neighboring counties of Suzhou and Jiangyin (chapters 15-17, 49). The scope of the Lost Writings is quite broad. The locations include metropolises, cities, towns, and villages, and the characters range from emperors, princes, officials, and soldiers to traitors, big and small lackeys, and hooligans. It records the ugliness of all parties during the chaotic times, and the most detailed descriptions are of the local customs at the time, which were probably what the author personally experienced.

Judging from the entire book, it is written in a very mediocre manner. Although it is difficult to find any major flaws, it also does not have any advantages. Besides the dry and tasteless records, there is very little dialogue. From a literary point of view, there is nothing to talk about. However, this book should not be regarded as a novel, but should be understood as historical material. Only in this way will it not be misunderstood. The historical significance, such as the Qing army's plunder of daughters, silk, and treasures, and their bestial massacres, are all valuable documents. The thirty-fifth chapter records the tragic death of Chen Ruyang, saying: "When the city was broken, his family barely managed to report, unable to walk. The husband and wife could only weep in despair. They were tied to the flagpole of Lu Yiji's house by soldiers, and his wife was stabbed to death in the bed in their home. On the third day, after the soldiers left, the villagers saw them, cut the ropes, but there was still a trace of breath in his throat." Such inhuman brutality would make anyone who saw it indignant. But who would have thought that more than two hundred years later, we would still suffer even worse treatment!

Yu Zhong also pointed out the various factors that led to the failure of the war of resistance at that time, such as the lack of fighting spirit of the official army generals, who guarded their own troops and fled in panic as soon as they were defeated. General Zheng in the fourth chapter and Hu Lai Gong in the eighth chapter are typical examples of this kind of person. There were even those who used the name of righteous soldiers to create a false impression, specializing in extorting money and food and robbing the people, as recorded in chapters 20, 21, and 23. As for the militia, except for Yan Shi's troops, most of them took advantage of the chaos to avenge themselves, resulting in a complete lack of discipline and even mutual killings (chapters 40 to 43); when faced with battle, they either remained motionless or scattered in all directions, such as Hu Longguang, who had no intention of defending the city and just watched the Qing army attack without firing a single arrow (chapter 28), and Shi Ziqiu's troops, who scattered completely as soon as they heard the news of the city's fall (chapter 31). Those in charge were either scholars who talked about war without any preparation, such as Jin Kuang, who tried to rescue Jiangyin without any prior contact or plan (chapter 18); or they seized the opportunity to seize troops without any national identity, such as Shi Ziqiu in chapter 26 and Ling Si in chapter 42. The officials and gentry at the time shamelessly surrendered and became accomplices of the enemy, such as Qian Qianyi, Xiao Shi'en, and Magistrate Ma, who were all used by the enemy one after another. Even those who were responsible for defending the territory, such as Cao Yuanfang, fled alone before the city fell. The common people, apart from trying to save their own lives, were not concerned about the safety of the nation. The most painful thing was that there were even traitors in the militia who were willing to be guides for the enemy, such as Zhao Botao, who was like the Wang Bamei and Xu Hongfa of that time. Although these are historical traces, the painful lessons will make us, who live more than two hundred years later, indignant—

The entire book seems to focus on Yan Shi raising local troops, but because there are so many characters and complicated threads, the position of the main characters is greatly reduced. Only five or six chapters are about Yan Shi's deeds, and there are only two times he uses soldiers, which clearly loses the unity of the entire book. The resistance of the magistrate of Fujian and the heroic sacrifice of the entire people of Jiangyin are all excellent subjects, but the author did not make good use of them, only giving a few cursory descriptions. Instead, he worked hard to write about the private fights of the people in the countryside and the stories of escaping from death, accounting for a quarter of the entire book (such as chapters 22, 28, 30, 34-36, 38, 40-43, 50, 51, 53, 54), which inevitably reversed the importance of things. The author witnessed the Qing army's massacre and should have had some good feelings for the uprising of the local troops. However, he did not, but thought it was meddlesome. For example, chapter 22 narrates Chen Mengli "daring to speak out when things happened," saying: "Changshu and Fushan are just small places. The Qing Dynasty is powerful. It is better to send someone there to negotiate and observe their movements. If we rashly raise troops, it is like using a praying mantis to stop a cart." In the thirty-seventh chapter, the author himself actually came out and said: "They are all bamboo spears and wooden sticks, wrapped in white cloth. To fight with the Qing Dynasty is really like using a praying mantis to stop a cart." This is really the same as the current "only weapons theory." The author is a person of the Ming Dynasty, and should have thoughts of the fallen state for the Ming Dynasty. For example, chapter 55 records the changing of Manchu costumes and writing. At least there should be some feelings of grief, but besides "and the customs have also changed greatly," he said nothing. In the end, he praised the alien rulers and their lackeys: "Since then, Yang Lian's prestige in training troops has become increasingly famous, and the sea soldiers (referring to the troops of the Ming Prince Yiyang) dared not invade the border, and the people once again enjoyed the blessings of peace." The author completely forgot about the insane massacre a few months ago! People like Qifeng Woodcutter, who are complacent and forgetful, are probably not rare now. Maybe they will even pull him to recognize acquaintances more than two hundred years ago. To avoid this bad influence depends on the reader's sense of proportion. This book, in the same series, is several times less valuable than the "Painful History."

Of course, no one has no hope, and no one does not want their hope to be realized, but few people know that hope is the most empty, useless, thin, and light thing in the world. It is the face of a child, a small boat on the Pacific Ocean, never to be grasped by people, and always playing with people's hearts. Therefore, yearning for hope is the thing that people love to do most, and it is also the most foolish thing that people do.

I used to hear people say, "Don't worry. The light of tomorrow is coming." These kinds of words seem to be very comfortable in my heart; it's right, but it's wrong. Dawn comes every day, even if you say "the light of tomorrow" is indeed "coming"; but if you just wait and wait until tomorrow, it is still a cloud of darkness, and all that shines is the morning sun.

Dawn does not come with "tomorrow", but is created by people with one hand, taken and placed in the future, letting it walk together under the skirt of "tomorrow". Of course, we welcome it when it comes; if it doesn't come, it means we are simply not worthy to receive the light.

Speaking of hope, you turn your head and see memories.

Memories are also pets of mankind. The past is sweet, yes, the past is beautiful, so what? Reversing the wheel of time? Pulling back the elapsed time? Unfortunately, humans don't have this ability.

Especially in articles, everyone has feelings, so why always stay in a dream and shout "sorrow", sighing a few lines "last year today..."? People are sentimental, I admit it, and I often have a lot of feelings in my heart. But I believe there is nothing to say except feelings. I often write things like memories, as if all the memories in my heart are accumulating more and more, pressing down too heavily to let them out. But in fact, in the corners of my mind, there are many things worth saying to others. It's not complaining, slogans, parroting, irresponsible remarks, and it's not a jumble of this copy and that copy, but my own life experience. My own experiences, my own knowledge.

As for imagination, it can also be said to be fantasy, but it cannot be said that it has no value. Good novels and good plays must be refined in the imagination to be beautiful and to be tinged with the flavor of literature.

Everyone has hope; everyone also has memories. But because everyone has them, they are worthless. We should escape from hope and memories, hide outside the brain, delve into the realm of reality, or add some thinking, think more and dream less. In this way, perhaps our literary world will be more refreshing, clearer, more realistic, more orderly, and there will be something worth hoping for, that is, our literary world may be able to waste less ink and save a little paper, and fully reflect this great era.

Of course, who wouldn't want to seize this good opportunity to write an epic, to weave blood and flesh into a picture, to depict today's human world, and leave it forever in the world?

### Field Notes

— Li Huiying

The so-called treat, when it comes to soldiers, is really too flexible. Ordinary people, when inviting guests, at least have to go to a restaurant, and a hundred and eighty doesn't count, but among the soldiers, even if you buy three cents worth of water chestnuts, you can get the praise of "treat."

However, under these circumstances, some "righteousness" was erected. The "foundation" and "mutual assistance" flowers bloomed in everyone's heart. Although everyone first gathered from various places, they became difficult comrades in life and death at this time. Of course, sometimes it is inevitable that they will get red in the face because of a small reason, and even scold their mothers and fathers face to face, but it doesn't matter. After a day, without anyone to persuade them, they will make peace.

The small restaurants in Linshan River finally made their fortunes on us. Why not eat a meal? In the original Baza place, you couldn't even find an egg. Didn't many people shout "see you later"? That was a remote little village, where you couldn't even buy a fried dough stick, let alone a restaurant. The food on the food was not lacking in meat, but people called it "pig food" and didn't eat it smoothly.

"Waiter, first bring four taels of wine!"

Wine is especially welcome among soldiers, just as they welcome cigarettes. This kind of laughable act may make outsiders shake their heads, but we don't care at all.

"Cut some fish and meat!"

"Bring a few salted duck eggs!"

The boss walked over with a smile on his face, holding a large fish in his hand, and said, winking:

"Comrades, do you want this fish?"

"How much money?"

"Can I charge you more?"

"Hurry up and cook it, cook it well!"

We set off again in the afternoon, and everyone felt a lot stronger.

4. Another Kind of People Living in the Countryside

Moving forward from Linshan River, the road was too difficult to walk, the road surface was completely paved with stones, and it was very painful to walk on. Fortunately, after walking not far, we forked onto a small road, where the grass was like a carpet, but it was very flat. But the road became narrower and narrower, and it also went into the mountain road, not as wide as when walking on the highway.

Next to the road, on a flat ground, there were five or six gun carriages parked. The gun muzzles were covered with tarpaulins, and camouflage was added to the carriages. There was a gunner lying under each carriage, but their eyes were already closed. The sound of our footsteps did not wake them from their good dreams. Sleeping had already made them unconsciously forget their respective duties.

But these guns are the sharp weapons we use to destroy the enemy. How majestic they are lying beside the road, and how much people love to carry them!

After turning over a small stone bridge, the mountain road became even narrower. Looking out at a glance, there were hills on the left and mountain slopes on the right. Although there were road junctions in front and behind, the distant places were still undulating small mountains. Only the road in the mountains can be regarded as a thoroughfare. The sky was still overcast, and the wind was still blowing, making the pine trees on the hillside ring. A few fallen leaves were swept into the air. It was autumn, and autumn is easy to make people feel emotional, but for a soldier, it doesn't cause much reaction. (To be continued)

### Going to the Market

— Jiliang

In Beibei, Sichuan, there still exists a medieval way of trading—going to the market.

The locals here call going to the market "going to the field." The first day of the month and mid-month are the dates for going to the market in Beibei. On this day, goods from all over the countryside are concentrated in this small town. On both sides of the street, on the beach near the Jialing River, are piles of goods moved from various townships, and various different commodities are also placed. The residents of the nearby area also rushed from their respective villages. You feel lively, but also feel noisy.

The goods at the market are arranged in a certain way, which is very convenient for buyers. The products of the rural people are all brought here on this day to be displayed. Generally, rice, beans, vegetables, etc. are placed on the relatively lively main street. Leather shoes, homespun cloth, bowls, and chopsticks are concentrated in another trading area. Other livestock such as pigs, ducks, and chickens are mostly gathered on the beach along the river. As for the temporary stalls, they are also gathered here. Therefore, Beibei during the market period, which is usually deserted, has become an important exchange. If you take a plane over this place, you will suspect that a meeting may be in progress.

The writer stood beside a vegetable stall at the market for a while, watching many fashionable people from the lower Yangtze River, struggling to learn the fluent Sichuan dialect, wandering around the vegetable stall, with difficulty written on their faces. "The people of Sichuan like to eat spicy vegetables, we only eat green vegetables," the writer noticed that the vegetables next to them, besides green vegetables, were garlic, spring vegetables, and chili peppers. These dishes are not suitable for the taste of the average person from the lower Yangtze River. People from the water towns come to the mountain country and cannot easily eat lively fresh fish, but they often stop their chopsticks at spicy tastes. This is indeed a bitter thing. The people from the lower Yangtze River who came from the war zone should turn around and go back to their hometown!

Among this group of people going to the market, the reporter learned about their daily life from a conversation with a cloth vendor. It is said that among the majority of merchants going to the market, 80% rely on the income from each market to maintain the life of their whole family. Although the money they get from each market is limited, because their goods in the past did not have to go through government taxation, plus their own living expenses are very low, therefore, their income from each market, if they can earn a number of six or seven yuan, has already reached their highest satisfaction. As for the ancient method of "bartering," this has ultimately become a thing of the past. Now, this phenomenon can no longer be seen at the market here.

Whenever it is market time in Beibei, from 6 am to 4 pm, the place is always crowded with people. This group leaves, and another group comes. They seem to be very busy, but if you carefully analyze the actions of each person, you will know that there are many people mixed in here who did not come for trade, some are taking advantage of the market opportunity to meet their relatives and friends, and some are just watching the excitement. Although they gather in the same place from different places, everyone's heart hides different hopes.

Recently, because of the expansion of the war zone, many institutions and schools have returned to Beibei, and many shops have also opened. Unlike in the past, the business here seems to be scattered. After this change, the commerce of Beibei should also gradually modernize.

### Curses and Gratitude

— By Ren Jun

— One of the Miscellaneous Poems During Wartime

Like cursing the most detestable plague,

I will use the most venomous words to curse the × planes,

— Curse the brutality of the × planes!

How can I not curse them? —

They ravaged our land —

They massacred our innocent compatriots —

However, I must also thank them,

— Their contribution is also not small!

Before they came,

Many people didn't even know what Japan was;

But now, airplane bombs have become the best textbook.

From then on, even a three-year-old child already knows:

Why we must fight to the death with ××,

Why we must drive out and overthrow ××.
