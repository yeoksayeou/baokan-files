### Guard Against the Treacherous Plots of the Enemy

Recently, due to the talks between the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, and the Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the enemy and pro-Japanese Chinese traitors are again spreading rumors, secretly releasing a smokescreen of "peace" and "compromise." At the same time, the news of a "sudden improvement in Sino-German relations" has also confused those who are concerned about the situation of the war of resistance. We should pay close attention to these messages. We must ruthlessly expose and combat the rumors and smokescreens of the enemy and pro-Japanese elements.

That Japan's military aggression against China cannot conquer China has not only become a commonly accepted inevitable trend, but the Japanese aggressors are also aware of this. The war of aggression against China has been stalled for five months. Although there has been renewed activity in Nanchang and southern Guangdong recently, it is not only unprofitable but also a commonly seen fact that the Japanese military's fighting strength is declining after a high degree of exertion. Therefore, the enemy is again thinking of using the international situation and the rumors of Chinese traitors to carry out the treacherous plan of inducing surrender.

Today, we must first understand that as long as the Japanese aggression does not stop, as long as the Japanese soldiers do not withdraw completely from Chinese territory, as long as the sacrifices and suffering endured by the Chinese people for more than twenty months are not compensated as they should be, and as long as the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation are not thoroughly realized, then China will never compromise with Japan, and China will never accept mediation from any party. This is the established national policy of our government. Behind this national policy is the extremely resolute and great power of 450 million people and all peace-loving and justice-loving people in the world. China is not Spain! China is even less Czechoslovakia! Any conspiracy to turn China into a second Spain or Czechoslovakia will be immediately crushed under the special conditions that Spain and Czechoslovakia did not have but that are currently being widely developed in our country. These conditions include the united front of long-term cooperation among all parties, strata, and ethnic minorities in the country under the revolutionary program of striving for national liberation and implementing the war of resistance and nation-building; that is, the general mobilization of all latent material and spiritual forces in the vast territory launched and led by the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek!

Secondly, we still await factual proof regarding the news of "improved Sino-German business relations." We cannot comment on it based on conjecture. Even if it is true, it is only an achievement of our country's diplomatic activities and should not be involved in political issues. Just as Germany advocates anti-communism, and the Soviet Union does not allow the provocations of German fascism, but Soviet-German business still continues to exist. However, we should pay attention to a few points here: First, the expansion of the power of the German fascist aggressors in Europe directly threatens European democratic countries. Britain and France are forced to focus on the European situation, which indirectly has an adverse effect on us. Japan has taken the opportunity to stir up trouble. It can be seen that the alignment of interests lies with Japan and Germany, not China and Germany. Second, Germany's recognition of the puppet state of Manchukuo illegally created by Japan, the recall of German advisors in China, and the recent consultation with Japan on the development of areas occupied by the Japanese army in China, as well as the news that a German-Japanese commercial treaty is about to be formally signed, all show Germany's contempt for and damage to China's personality and interests. Today, we should be more vigilant against the treacherous plan of inducing surrender through collusion between Germany and Japan! Third, at a time when the movement for unity among democratic countries is developing and the friendship between China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States is progressing, the enemy is instigating puppet governments to oppose Britain and the Soviet Union, while at the same time instigating pro-Japanese elements to spread rumors that China has changed its diplomatic policy and is striving for close relations with Germany. At the same time, they are also releasing a smokescreen that Japan "has no intention of being in opposition" to democratic countries. Their intention is to weaken the credibility of our government among the people and internationally, to provoke discord in our domestic unity and international relations, and to undermine the cooperation of democratic and peace-loving countries.

Although the treacherous plans of the Japanese enemy, pro-Japanese Chinese traitors, and international fascist warmongers, such as "peace," "compromise," and "mediation," are "increasingly intensified" and "emerging endlessly," we are not afraid! We are not panicking; because this new launch of such conspiracies by the enemy and their opportunistic and insidious shameless activities are precisely an exposure of their ugly state of being at the end of their rope; on the contrary, it is also a sign that our war of resistance and nation-building has already turned towards brightness and victory. What we cannot fail to remind everyone of is that at present, our domestic political and economic situation, international relations, and the military situation of the war of resistance have all turned to the bright and victorious side in the big picture. We must not ignore this favorable situation for us because of the various rumors and fallacies of the enemy, and we must not have the slightest pessimism or disappointment because of the superficial and local "advances and retreats" in the military, so as not to fall prey to the enemy's conspiracies of "anti-communism," "peace," "compromise," and "mediation," which sow discord. We must further point out that the enemy's conspiracies have already reached a point of exhaustion, and they will no longer cause surprise to any Chinese person who does not want to be a slave or to any knowledgeable and just person internationally. It is not very difficult for us to combat such conspiracies of the enemy at present; we only need to be able to unite the country more closely and support the government's national policy of adhering to the war of resistance. If the whole country insists on unity and resistance, our politics will inevitably progress day by day, and our diplomatic front of uniting democratic and peace-loving countries will be stronger. Our main task today is to enhance our national self-esteem and self-confidence, resolutely implement the general program for the national spiritual mobilization, and warmly support the government's national policy of consolidating unity and adhering to the war of resistance!

### Nurturing the Masters of the New China!

— Shufen

How to Commemorate This Year's "Children's Day"?

The "Children's Day" of 1939 is approaching soon!

Chinese children have always been excluded from the door of happiness. They cannot enjoy a comfortable life, and they cannot enjoy the necessary education.

Since the all-out war of resistance began, the fate of Chinese children has become even worse! Especially the children in the war zone, the girls are inevitably abandoned, and the boys mostly follow their fathers and brothers, living in dire straits. The children in the occupied areas are even more crying out in the enemy's artillery fire and under their iron hooves. Their painful lives are unimaginable!

More than twenty months have passed since the start of the war of resistance. We have made considerable progress in military, political, economic, and diplomatic fields. The enemy has encountered increasingly serious difficulties in military, political, economic, and diplomatic fields. However, our progress has not reached the level of immediately turning defeat into victory, and at the same time, the enemy's difficulties have not developed to the point of immediately losing its offensive power and being driven out by us. Therefore, the war is long-term. We must overcome our advantages with disadvantages in the long-term, repel the oppressors with the oppressed, and drive out the aggressors with the power of the entire national mobilization while preparing to build an independent, free, and happy New China in the war of resistance. Precisely because the war is long-term, all our young men and women must serve to supplement the urgent needs of the front lines; precisely because we want to build an independent, free, and happy New China in the long-term war of resistance, all our young men and women must also serve to cultivate the forces for building the rear. If not a single one of our young men and women is mobilized, how can we not plan to nurture our future generations at the same time? Shouldn't we prepare in advance the soldiers who will build the New China in the future?

Nurturing children, nurturing the masters of the New China—this slogan must be solemnly put forward in the current special environment and urgent need.

I. The Historical Significance of Nurturing the Masters of the New China

The Chinese nation is fighting for complete liberation, the Chinese nation must also fight for the creation of an independent, free, and happy New China, the Chinese nation is fighting to defend world peace, and the Chinese nation must also fight to advance human culture; this struggle is the task of creating a new history. It is not only Chinese but also global. In the struggle to accomplish this great task, cultivating our nation's descendants and nurturing the masters of our future New China has become an urgent historical task.

Nurturing children during wartime should have been regarded by the government as the most proactive undertaking among various wartime control initiatives, and as the most important task in the overall national defense plan. However, all our past national defense preparation plans, because of the existence of our country's special environment and special conditions in the past, had to be gradually fully and completely implemented in the course of the war of resistance. It was not until March 10 of last year that, under the responsible leadership of Madam Soong Mei-ling, women leaders from all sectors of the country were recruited, and with the active support of leaders from all military and political circles of the country, a wartime children's welfare association was established. By July of last year, branches had been established in Chongqing, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Guiyang, Guilin, Liu'an in Anhui, Fuzhou, Zhengzhou, and other places. Preparations were also actively underway in Kunming, Changsha, Chengdu, and other places, and childcare centers were being planned in various places, covering almost all the major cities in the country that had not been ravaged by the enemy. The spirit of endeavor of Madam Soong Mei-ling and women leaders from all sectors is highly admirable and will occupy a glorious page in the history of building the New China in the future and in the history of building a new world and a new society in the future. However, since the war of resistance for more than twenty months, the war zones have expanded, and children in the war zones have been increasingly killed and trampled by the enemy. Those who are fortunate enough not to die under the enemy's artillery fire are mostly orphans who have no support because their parents have been brutally killed and their families have been destroyed. It is particularly noteworthy that the enemy is transporting children under the age of twelve in the occupied areas to Japan for enslavement education, preparing to send them back to China in the future to kill their parents, brothers, and sisters, and to implement the treacherous plan of using Chinese to control Chinese. At the same time, as the war zones expand and more of our young compatriots are killed and injured, and as the war becomes more protracted, our need for people to promote the cause of nation-building becomes more urgent, and the problem of our future generations becomes more serious. Therefore, the movement to nurture children still needs to be expanded, called for, and promoted more intensely today. At the same time, we must recognize that, first, because our war of resistance is precisely to seek national liberation, that is, to prevent our children from becoming slaves of a conquered nation, we must recognize that promoting nurturing children in the rear and being nannies for the masters of the New China is the same as being soldiers fighting the enemy in blood on the front lines, all are warriors defending national liberation and world peace. Our child nurturing movement is by no means merely a passive, charitable, and humanitarian movement, but an active movement to save the country and the world. Second, many female warriors are unable to dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to the cause of national liberation, war of resistance, and nation-building because they are encumbered by their families and children. If we actively promote the child nurturing movement, so that the children of every soldier, farmer, and worker can enjoy proper care and education in safe areas, then soldiers, farmers, and workers can be free from worries and can work hard for the country and the nation on the battlefield, on the farm, and in the factory with peace of mind. Therefore, the child nurturing movement is a significant movement to save the nation during the war of resistance and can lay the foundation for the smooth progress of building the New China in the future. Second, we must also understand that the child nurturing movement is also one of the main tasks of the current struggle for women's liberation, because if women want to be liberated, they must participate in the cause of war of resistance and nation-building like men, and they must catch up with men and replace men in the war. Only in this way can women's social and political status be improved. If women want to actively participate in the cause of war of resistance and nation-building, they must first settle their children. Therefore, if we use collective strength to universally implement the method of nurturing children, nurturing children for them, then they can all work hard for the country and the nation, and at the same time, they will also embark on the road to women's liberation.

II. The Specific Work of Nurturing Children During Wartime

How should we carry out the work of nurturing children and nurturing the masters of the New China during wartime? The wartime children's welfare association of the China Women's Comforting and Defending War Soldiers Association under the leadership of Madam Soong Mei-ling has stipulated the following tasks:

1. Organize welfare branches in various places.

2. Establish welfare centers in various places (divided into four types: 1. temporary welfare centers, 2. transportation stations, 3. permanent welfare centers, 4. cooperating with other charities to accommodate refugee children).

3. Collect a large number of refugee children.

4. Intensify national and international publicity.

5. Expand fundraising (divided into two types: cash and assuming children's education expenses). The past few months have seen a lot of fundraising from all sectors.

6. Organize training classes for childcare personnel.

The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region branch led by Kang Keqing and Ding Ling plans to be formally established in July 1938. Their specific work is based on the general outline of the general association, starting with the organization section to investigate the number of homeless children in the border region, investigate the families of anti-Japanese soldiers and the children of working cadres, and investigate the lives and education of general children in the border region. According to the actual situation of children in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and in line with the needs of the war of resistance, the following work will be carried out: 1. Establish a wartime children's welfare center in the border region, divided into three classes: (1) Infant class, expand the existing nursery; (2) Kindergarten class; (3) Children's class. The target of accommodation is homeless children from the Northeast, children of anti-Japanese families and working cadres, and children who have fled from various places.

2. Establish a nanny training class. Concentrate the existing nanny experience and nursing experience personnel in the border area, give them special training, train on the one hand, and practice on the other. After graduation, they will serve as nannies in the welfare center or supply the needs of other nurseries and children's education institutions to strengthen and improve children's education during the war of resistance.

3. Improve the treatment of newborns and improve the lives of mothers.

4. Organize propaganda groups to improve children's health education in the border area.

5. Establish a children's health care section and obtain working assistance from the border area hospital to serve children exclusively. On the one hand, it serves as a health care advisory body for children in the welfare association, and on the other hand, it enables children in the border area to enjoy medical benefits more universally.

6. Transport battlefield children and obtain close contact and assistance from front-line anti-Japanese troops, battlefield service groups, and local people's organizations, and gradually transport children in the war zone into the border area.

These specific tasks of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Wartime Children's Welfare Branch are determined based on the general principles of the general association, with reference to the actual situation and special conditions of the border region, and adapting to the new needs of the war of resistance and nation-building. Although their work has geographical limitations, it can be used as a reference for those who strive for children's welfare work in various places.

However, if we want to earnestly, practically, and universally promote this movement to nurture children, based on the past work of the wartime children's welfare general association and the branch associations in various places and the difficulties encountered, there are still several major problems that need to be solved urgently.

The first is the problem of financial difficulties. The general association has allocated 10,000 yuan from the comforting general association as the start-up fee for the welfare center, and the rest must be donated from outside. As of July last year, it had received more than 240,000 yuan in cash, and more than 3,240 enthusiastic people from all walks of life have assumed the burden of children's education expenses. The results cannot be said to be bad, but the cost needs are increasing, and how to sustain it seems to be a problem. As for the branch associations, in addition to a few that can be subsidized by the general association (such as the Sichuan branch, which was allocated 5,000 yuan by the general association as a start-up fee), most rely on the members of the branch association to work hard to donate and solicit donations. For example, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region branch association has been relying entirely on fundraising to support its expenses since the establishment of the preparatory committee, and the financial resources of the border region are very limited. As of the end of July last year, it had received 300 yuan, which is a remarkable achievement in the border area of the branch association (the salaries of the highest officials in the border area do not exceed 5 yuan). This situation may not only be the case in the Northwest. Therefore, on the one hand, we still hope that the central government can have a unified and appropriate solution to support it, but on the other hand, we even more hope that the people who know the importance of nurturing our future generations and the urgent need to strive for the victory of the war of resistance will immediately donate generously, especially our overseas Chinese compatriots, who should do their best to contribute money and create a glorious fundraising achievement.

The second is the difficulty of transporting children in the war zone. Because most of the children in the war zone or wandering in areas near the war zone are children of poor laborers. Their parents have no blessing to enjoy modern education, and they have a very strong love for their children. They would rather have their children die by their side as wandering beggars or die from hunger and disease than hand them over to others for good education. Therefore, some people say, "When collecting in the war zone, we are not afraid of the enemy's bombing, but we are most afraid of parents who do not understand education and do not realize it until they die." Today, we must step up publicity to make the general public understand the meaning of nurturing children, and at the same time cooperate with government decrees to achieve the purpose of accommodation and education. The practice of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region branch (see above) is worth learning from in various places.

Third, there is a lack of specialized talents. Nurturing children and improving children's health education both require the cooperation of medical professionals, such as pediatric experts, doctors, nurses, etc. On the one hand, we ask the government and the wartime children's welfare general association to mobilize considerable manpower and financial resources from the national scope to help the branch associations in various places, so that the work of nurturing children can be more sound and substantial. On the other hand, we hope that pediatric experts, doctors, nurses,, etc. at home and abroad will voluntarily and enthusiastically contribute. We want everyone to work together to shoulder the historical task of nurturing the nation's descendants and nurturing the masters of the New China.

III. The Urgent Task of Nurturing the Nation's Descendants at Present

We are born in this difficult era. Adults are forced by the Japanese aggressors to rise up and fight to protect their personality and avoid extinction; and our innocent children are also trapped in an unprecedented disaster. When we think of our younger brothers and sisters and our young children wandering, dying, and crowding the roads, although we beat our chests and stomp our feet and feel very sad, we must recognize our nation's enemy, the Japanese aggressor, and we must recognize our responsibilities, especially our female compatriots who do not wield weapons to defend the country. We must be determined to serve and sacrifice to nurture our nation's descendants and nurture the masters of our future New China. Madam Soong Mei-ling said: "Now, tens of thousands of children have become wandering orphans because their parents have died; some have parents, but their families are so poor that they have no place to stand, and food and clothing are a problem. We have to take care of all these children - how to solve their food, clothing, shelter, and education is all our responsibility. They are all strong men of future China, that is, a part of the force that supports the country. From our nature of caring for children, we cannot bear to see these tens of thousands of innocent children wandering without support, but most importantly, in order to complete our task of protecting the country, we cannot sit idly by and watch these children suffer without rescuing them." She also said: "We estimate that the simplest food, clothing, shelter, and education expenses for each child per year will be 60 yuan. Now we ask our compatriots to estimate how many children's welfare expenses each person can afford. This kind of movement is of great significance. Everyone who should donate money should feel that they are paying this money to truly and directly help the country save the consumption and loss of manpower, and indirectly help the country build a strong and promising new nation!"

To nurture our nation's descendants and to nurture the masters of our New China, first, we must step up and expand all publicity work. First of all, we naturally require newspapers and magazines at home and abroad, especially overseas Chinese newspapers and magazines, to regularly and specifically report the situation of the enemy persecuting our country's children and women, and to expand the publicity work of rescuing children in the war zone and nurturing children in the rear. Secondly, national salvation organizations, especially women's organizations, urgently need to cooperate with schools and leaders from all walks of life to organize various forms of propaganda teams, use wandering children's propaganda teams, wandering children's national salvation singing teams, acting teams, etc., to report the stories of children who have suffered under the Japanese invasion, and to ask all housewives to help and persuade them to work hard to participate in the movement to nurture children. Secondly, we must promote the movement to improve family education, so that any family knows how to nurture their children, especially to mobilize housewives and children to read newspapers and books, care about current affairs, and use regular visits and gatherings to make them start to live a regular collective life. Reduce all selfish and self-interested ideas, superstitions, and wasteful bad habits, and cultivate the habit of empathy and love for groups, to prepare for a good atmosphere in the future New China. Thirdly, we must step up all children's cultural work, and produce a large number of small books with correct consciousness, pictures, words, popular prices, to replace all street children's comic books (doll books) that contain toxins, fully develop life education, and promote the street national salvation short drama movement and other popular entertainment with national salvation significance. Fourthly, we must step up international publicity work, at least (1) send all the specific materials of the enemy's atrocities against our children and women to newspapers and magazines in various countries, and overseas Chinese and students must work harder to supplement the shortcomings of the government's efforts, (2) report the enemy's atrocities and our country's heroic resistance on the front line and the nurturing of children in the rear to religious groups, charitable organizations, trade unions, agricultural associations, and cultural women's organizations, and even private friends in various countries, to inspire their sympathy for us, enhance their belief in us, and increase their assistance to us, (3) mobilize Chinese and foreign celebrities to broadcast the enemy's atrocities against our children and women and requests for sympathy and assistance to the world in various languages, (4) produce anti-war films on a large scale and in a planned way, especially films about Chinese children who have been innocently killed and insulted, and show them publicly in various countries, (5) send refugee children representatives to various countries and to overseas Chinese for publicity. Finally, fifthly, and most importantly, we must immediately further expand and persist in the fundraising movement. We must use the ancient teaching of "cherishing our own young ones and cherishing the young ones of others" to ask women and children in middle and upper class families to save their entertainment, banquet, gift-giving, and daily waste, donate money to children's welfare centers, and donate money to help develop all undertakings to nurture children.

IV. Shoulder the Historical Task!

Under the frenzied and insatiable attacks of the Japanese aggressors, all Chinese sons and daughters who do not want to be slaves, and the weak and powerless old and young Chinese people, are continuing to be whipped, robbed, raped, and killed. The weak Chinese descendants, our future generations, the masters of the New China, and those on whom we place our last hope, are suffering an unprecedentedly tragic fate. In the war zone, hunger, displacement, and death; in the occupied area, bullying, anesthesia, massacre, and looting; in the vast areas of China, there is displacement, wandering, loss of homes, and no sight of parents!

We cannot tolerate it! We cannot tolerate it!

We must build a new China, and we must nurture our descendants—we are fighting for a new China, and we must protect the masters of our New China!

Let us earnestly assume the historical task of nurturing children given to us! All Chinese compatriots! All overseas Chinese compatriots! The masters of the New China will breed and grow strong in the rain of bullets and blood of war. Let us come out with our chests out!

### A Review and Outlook on Yulin Culture Over the Past Year

(Yulin Correspondence) The sound of cannons at Lugou Bridge awakened the people of the whole country who were unwilling to be slaves, and it also awakened the cultural circles of Yulin—

They have already moved into action. Their first heroic act was to sweep away the old and outdated slogans of the past, like wormwood blown by the northwest wind. Appearing on the streets were brand new and revolutionary slogans and cartoons for resisting Japan. Especially noteworthy were the slogans and cartoons in which the content fully expressed the cooperation between the military and the people, and the close unity between the Han and Mongol people, vividly reflecting the joint defense against the powerful enemy.

Those engaged in cultural work are all patriotic and enthusiastic young cultural workers who, even before the Lugou Bridge Incident, had long been determined to dedicate everything they had to the struggle to overthrow Japanese imperialism! Under enthusiastic encouragement and the urgent demands of the objective environment, the supplements of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Daily, such as "Bian Feng" (Border Wind), "Hui Yin" (Echo), "Nu Shen" (Goddess) (literary), "Dang Sheng" (Party Voice), "Wei Sheng" (Hygiene), and "Kang Ri" (Resist Japan) weeklies, sprang up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. They received enthusiastic love from the broad masses of the people, especially young students, who almost universally read them, placing great hopes on them. Speaking of which, "Bian Feng" and "Nu Shen" were relatively progressive publications. However, the development of events is often tortuous. In November 1937, they were all forced to cease publication due to the newspaper's reduction in size.

However, the wheels of time are advancing day by day. The students of Yulin will not remain silent. The publication of "Meng Xing" (Awakening) still could not meet the demands of the masses. Through the efforts of the tank corps and student groups, "Qian Shao Xun Kan" (Vanguard Biweekly) (a comprehensive publication) was born with a mimeographed face. Later, thanks to the support and care of the military and political leaders of Yulin, it was finally able to be published in mimeographed form. Since Yulin had its own publications, "Qian Shao" (edited by Zhang Shushen and others, graduates of the three schools) was the one that could best solve practical problems and played a promoting role, fulfilling its responsibility to offer criticisms and suggestions regarding the Support Association, military training, and all facilities related to resisting Japan. However, due to unfavorable circumstances, it ended its precious and memorable life after only twelve issues. Soon after (around April 1938), with the help of military and political leaders such as Yang, Sun, Deng, Gao, and Shi, "Kang Ri Xun Kan" (Resist Japan Biweekly) was published under the name of the Propaganda Department of the Support Association. The editors in charge were Yang Erqiong, Zhu Huiming, Tang Zhaowu, and Cao Bohang. The content was more practical than "Qian Shao," but unfortunately, it also ceased publication after only fourteen issues. "Qian Jin Xun Kan" (Forward Biweekly) (now changed to a tri-weekly) is a publication used by the 86th Division to educate soldiers internally. Generally speaking, this publication focuses on the life of the barracks and articles promoting the fighting spirit of soldiers. The editors in charge are Mr. He Rumin and Tuan Jixin. This is the only publication in the Yulin army.

A temporary silence and interruption in the development of events is a period for brewing the potential for further development. Cultural work entered a state of dormancy in September and October.

From November 1938 to the present, a few cultural workers from the outside have come to Yulin, and the original cultural workers have become active again. They are developing the organization of the Yulin Branch of the China Youth Journalists Association, and the Northwest Battlefield Work Corps has also been realized step by step. In addition, the Battlefield Cultural Service Department of the General Political Department of the Military Commission is also setting up a branch. (To be continued)

### Our Army Reinforces the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, Intercepting and Annihilating Over a Thousand Enemy Troops Daily, Our Army Counterattacks in Wuning and Gaoan

[Our Newspaper Chongqing, 31st Dispatch] Guilin Telegram: After the enemy occupied Nanchang, they set fire to all the villages near the county seat to prevent our guerrillas from hiding, and continued to attack south, attempting to spy on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. After our army intercepted them for several days, the enemy suffered more than a thousand casualties. Some of our units have been dispatched to reinforce and will inflict heavy damage on the enemy north of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Near Wuning, our army is fiercely counterattacking. Our army is also continuously attacking the enemy near Fengxin on the south bank of Xiushui and Gaoan. The central Jiangxi area, including Dongxiang, Jinxian, Fengcheng, and the southern part of Gaoan, is dominated by continuous mountain ranges, which will make future operations increasingly disadvantageous for the enemy. Some of our units have attacked Tongcheng for several days, killing more than a hundred enemy troops.

Jiangxi-Hunan Front

[Central News Agency, Xiushui, 31st Dispatch] The enemy in Fengxin attacked Gaoyou City, northeast of Gaoan, along the highway on the morning of the 31st. Some of our units are bravely fighting to meet them. Some of our units who fought fiercely in Niuhang and Songbu safely arrived at a certain location on the morning of the 31st.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 31st Dispatch] On the 29th, after noon, over 300 enemy troops and more than ten tanks attacked Xiangfu Temple (ten miles northeast of Gaoan) via Longpi Bridge (fifteen miles northeast of Gaoan). One enemy tank was destroyed and over 30 enemy troops were killed. The enemy retreated in disarray. In the afternoon of the same day, the enemy attacked our position at Miaoqianshan (ten miles north of Gaoan) and were also repelled.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 31st Dispatch] News from here says that while the Chinese and Japanese armies were fiercely fighting in the suburbs of Nanchang, the Chinese army had already begun to retreat and is now retreating to Fengcheng, 30 kilometers south of Nanchang. However, according to the announcement of the General Headquarters, the suburbs of Nanchang are still in the hands of the Chinese army. Reinforcements are constantly arriving from the rear to Nanchang and will give the invaders a heavy blow. Currently, the Japanese army is employing a flanking strategy, advancing towards Qingjiang (a station south of Gaoan on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway) to cut off the Chinese army's retreat. According to the Chinese army's announcement, a total of 20,000 people died on both sides in the Battle of Nanchang. Furthermore, according to the observation of military authorities, the Japanese army will not enter southern Jiangxi but will only attack Changsha and Yichang. Sources with good information say that the Chinese government will send a large army to defend, it is said.

[Central News Agency, Boro, 31st Dispatch] Approximately 1,000 enemy troops in the southeastern area of Yuezhou launched an attack on our besieging forces from Matang Station and Guozhen City on the morning of the 31st, attempting to break through. Fierce fighting is currently underway.

Hubei-Henan Front

[Central News Agency, Xuancheng, 31st Dispatch] In central Hubei, our army and the enemy are still confronting each other on the original positions. There is no change in the war situation.

[Central News Agency, Xuancheng, 31st Dispatch] The puppet troops in eastern Hubei are now defecting one after another, joining our guerrilla forces to jointly attack the enemy. Furthermore, the puppet troops of Tu Zhanting in Yuekou have also defected.

[Central News Agency, Zhaoyang, 31st Dispatch] Our troops attacking Xinyang won another victory yesterday, killing over 300 enemy troops. The enemy is finding it difficult to reinforce. Our army is still pressing closer to the city of Xinyang.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 31st Dispatch] Xi'an Telegram: Our army attacked Linfen and occupied Zhangli Station. The enemy counterattacked Zheshan, and fierce fighting is underway. The Japanese army has greatly increased its forces on the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong, with the intention of launching another fierce attack. Some of our units once occupied Dawenkou on the Jinpu Railway and destroyed a railway bridge. Furthermore, we captured Suzhou in northern Anhui yesterday.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 31st Dispatch] Fancheng Telegram: Some of our units launched another fierce attack on Xinyang on the 29th and 30th, achieving many victories in the Huangshan area. The enemy in central Hubei has been shelling Shayang for several days and using many incendiary bombs. A certain commander said that the enemy is pretending to make a show of crossing the river, using attack as a defense.

### Our Army Strengthening on the Northern Front, General Counterattack About to Begin, Enemy Military Intelligence Released, Causing Great Panic in the Nanjing Area

[Joint Press, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] All Japanese newspapers here tonight carried news from the Beijing area, saying that General Chiang Kai-shek is planning a major counterattack in North China. It is said that one route of this counterattack is on the battle lines south of Longhai, and the other is attacking eastward from Xi'an, Shaanxi. In addition, an offensive will also be adopted in the Suiyuan and Chahar areas. The newspapers also reported that Chairman Chiang also intends to expand the activities of guerrilla forces on all lines to achieve a coordinated effect. This news has caused considerable panic here, it is said.

[Beijing, 31st Dispatch] According to Japanese sources, Chairman Chiang is currently planning to launch a large-scale counterattack on various battlefields starting in April. The main counterattack locations will be between Nanjing and Hangzhou and on various battlefields south of the Yangtze River. Large guerrilla forces will move from north and south to coordinate with the Northwest Army in Shaanxi and Gansu, advancing eastward. The initial stage of this military activity has already been underway since mid-March. The Chinese army recently fighting the Japanese army in Shandong and Jiangsu is a newly formed force. Currently, China's strategy is to divide the war zone into three regions: South, West, and North. In the Southern Region, Yu Xuezhong's army, originally stationed near Shangcheng, is currently advancing northeast to counterattack the Japanese army northeast of Xuzhou. Sun Lianzhong's army, advancing south from Henan Province, will join forces with Sun Tongxuan's army stationed near Zhengzhou, concentrating their forces to advance northeast. At the same time, the 40th Army near Yancheng and Sun Dianying's troops stationed in Shanzhou will cross the Yellow River and advance north with Zhu De's 18th Group Army and Wei Lihuang's 14th Group Army. In the Western Region, Tao Zhiyue's and Li Wen's troops stationed in Da'aiguan and southeastern Shaanxi will also cross the Yellow River to counterattack southwestern Shanxi. In addition, Fan Hanbao's and Huang Liu's armies will also launch a unified counterattack on various lines in Shanxi. Furthermore, Sun Zhen's 8th Group Army and Yang Aiyuan's 6th Group Army have already crossed into western Shanxi and are currently rushing eastward. The famous general Hu Zongnan has also led a large army, moving his command post from Xi'an. As for the Northern Region, Fu Zuoyi's 7th Group Army and He Zhuguo's 2nd Cavalry Group Army have advanced towards Baotou. Ma Hongda's Ningxia Army is also following closely behind, rushing towards Suiyuan Province.

### Japanese Instruct Puppets to Promote Anti-British Sentiment, Puppet United Association Issues Absurd Declaration, British Foreign Office Has Received Report

[Reuters, London, 30th Dispatch] Today in the British House of Commons, Conservative MP Morgan asked whether the Japanese are instructing their newly established puppet government in China to engage in anti-British propaganda and whether the government has received any reports. Undersecretary Butler replied that the Foreign Secretary has received reports regarding this propaganda, but it has not yet been officially confirmed.

[Nanjing, 30th Dispatch] Japanese sources: The North-South Two Puppet United Association held a meeting in Nanjing on the 30th and issued a declaration, wantonly attacking various countries that are helping China resist Japan, especially criticizing Britain. It stated that the British government had lent 10 million pounds to our country, and its intention was nothing more than to use its financial power to "disturb the peace of East Asia." Finally, it threatened various countries, saying that if they dared to take "anti-peace actions" against the puppet organization, the puppet organization would abandon its consistent "friendly" attitude and no longer "respect" the vested interests of various countries.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 31st Urgent Telegram] A Japanese spokesman recently declared that the Japanese side does not intend to stop the anti-foreign movements, especially the anti-British movement, in the Japanese-occupied areas, as long as they do not infringe on the lives and property of foreigners. The spokesman continued that as long as the Sino-Japanese War exists, the Japanese-occupied areas will never be open to third-country people. However, when reporters asked that if the Japanese government recognizes the existence of the Sino-Japanese War, Roosevelt may implement the Neutrality Act, the spokesman evasively said that the war does not actually exist, only bullets are flying because the two sides have not declared war.

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 31st Dispatch] A Japanese spokesman said that the anti-British and anti-foreign movements in the Japanese-occupied areas are spontaneous. Although the newspapers in various places have been inspected by the Japanese side, the Japanese side believes that the anti-foreign sentiments of the newspapers are entirely a natural reaction because various foreign countries are unanimously helping the Chongqing side. The Japanese military spokesman explained the reason for not being able to open the occupied areas, saying that no place in the Japanese-occupied area is not continuing combat operations. The Japanese military finds it difficult to quell the activity of the Chinese guerrillas.

### Wang Jingwei Publishes XXX Thesis, Defending His XXX for Advocating Peace

[Our Hong Kong News] Wang Jingwei published an article this morning (dated the 27th of the third month of this year, the location is unknown) entitled "Give an Example". The article is about 4,000 words long. It first mourns the death of Zeng Zhongming, then recounts the process of reporting the mediation of German envoy Trautmann at the Supreme National Defense Conference on December 6, 1937, distorting his advocacy of peace for defense. Finally, it expresses three points: (1) The reason why I left the country is to show that as long as the proposal is adopted, the individual is not a problem. (2) International mediation should be carried out in conjunction with direct negotiations. In this way, my assistance from the sidelines as an unofficial person is not without benefit. (3) If this situation continues to stagnate, I will return even if I leave the country.

### National Government Order

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 31st Dispatch] The National Government issued an order on the 31st:

(1) Appointing Yun Zhen as the Director of the Electricity Department of the Resources Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. This order.

(2) Appointing Song as the Director of the Water Affairs Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. This order.

(3) Appointing Chen Ruzhen as the Director of the River Defense Department of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission. This order.

(4) Appointing Dai Zhongyu as the Secretary-General of the Fujian Provincial Provisional Council. This order.

(5) The President of National Tongji University, Weng Zhilong, requested to resign due to illness. Weng Zhilong is permitted to be relieved of his original position. This order.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 31st Dispatch] The National Government issued an order on the 31st:

Lu Xinshou, a standing committee member of the Anti-Smoking Committee of the Ministry of Interior, has profound virtue and pure character, and broad knowledge. Initially, he made many suggestions during the Northern Expedition of the Hunan Army. After unification was achieved, he assisted in key positions in the Executive Yuan of the National Government, making significant contributions with loyalty and diligence. Later, he served as the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Zhejiang Province and the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, both times maintaining integrity and achieving clear results. In recent years, he has been in charge of drug prohibition, with detailed and comprehensive planning. Throughout his life, he has been both moral and capable. Now that the country is in a difficult situation, and his contributions are especially needed, he has passed away due to overwork, which is deeply regrettable. A public funeral should be held, and the Executive Yuan should be instructed to make proper arrangements. The Examination Yuan should also be instructed to have the Ministry of Personnel conduct a posthumous review in accordance with regulations. His life's achievements should be recorded and made available to the national history to show the government's sincere remembrance of outstanding individuals. This order.

### A New Path for Guangdong Politics (4)

— Li Yuzhong

Shaoguan Special Correspondent

(2) How to Improve Lower-Level Political Organizations

Regarding the county level in terms of organization: (1) Increase the powers and responsibilities of the county, giving it the power to make prompt decisions within a considerable scope. For example, when Conghua fell, a middle school in Wengyuan was in a state of half-suspension, returning for a long time. The county magistrate waited to receive instructions from the Department of Education before daring to make a decision, and the content of that instruction was nothing more than "dissolve if necessary." (2) Make the county government organization suitable for guerrilla warfare needs. The first section is general affairs, the second section is finance, the third section is education, and the fourth section is construction. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, education and construction were suspended in many counties. In the future, there will be a special department in charge of mass mobilization, as well as suppressing traitors. (3) Abolish redundant organizations. It is common to see many empty signs hanging at the entrance of the county government, such as the New Life Promotion Association, the Support Association, the Military Discipline and Morality Maintenance Association, the Rescue Committee, the Anti-Smoking and Anti-Gambling Committee, etc. The title of president is all concentrated on the county magistrate. (4) Strengthen the connection between organizations below the county level, democratize internally, and popularize externally. Establish a strict inspection system. In the past, the so-called secret inspections by the Department of Civil Affairs were filled out by the county magistrate himself. This method is unacceptable. (5) The treatment of civil servants should not be too disparate, with the standard being able to meet the minimum living expenses. This can not only inject money into the government's finances but also prevent corruption.

Regarding townships, townships, and neighborhood groups: (1) Complete local autonomy and establish township people's congresses and district people's congresses, based on public opinion. (2) Universally establish strong professional organizations, regularly organize representative meetings, implement various wartime tasks, replace the neighborhood group system, and achieve the best mobilization work. (3) It is necessary to determine the office expenses of lower-level organizations and guarantee the minimum living expenses of lower-level cadres.

Regarding the system: (1) The heads of counties, districts, townships, towns, and neighborhood groups should be elected by the people in principle. Before achieving popular elections, public opinion should be the basis, and the standard should be to be able to do things for the people and seek welfare. (2) Cultivate township-level talent and train young people to serve as village cadres to replace corrupt and old elements. (3) Screen existing heads of neighborhood groups, because the neighborhood group system is national, and this province cannot be abolished, but all neighborhood group heads should be screened and eliminated as soon as possible. (4) Boldly and extensively use knowledgeable young people as lower-level cadres. The principle of using cadres should be "using people based on merit" rather than "using people based on relationships." (5) Orders must be effectively executed and strictly enforced. 3. How to Strengthen and Expand Mass Self-Defense Organizations

Strengthening and expanding mass self-defense organizations is not only possible but also necessary: (1) To unify the leadership organization of self-defense; (2) To establish faith in front of the masses, in the past, self-defense was used to recruit security teams, and the security team was changed to a security brigade. A transfer has turned into a formal army, and the local burden of salaries has given the people a bad impression. (3) Strengthen the leadership body. Leaders cannot have any selfish thoughts and cannot regard the self-defense organization as personal property. It is not allowed to deliberately create territory. (4) Ensure continuous supplies. In the past, the funds for a guerrilla headquarters in a certain area were only 500 yuan per month, and the guerrilla command headquarters in a certain county only received 300 yuan. However, the funds for September last year have not been issued until January of this year. For example, the self-defense corps of ×× protects gambling, which is not without principle; (5) Improve the content of military education and political education, and avoid dryness and tastelessness. It is necessary to use literacy classes to penetrate political common sense and use singing to stimulate their spirit. The method of large-scale lectures cannot be used too much, and small group meetings should be used to promote collective self-education. (6) Improve the way self-defense corps are managed. First of all, the beating and scolding system must be abolished, and gun tips cannot be used to stop running away. To be continued

### Aggressor Nations Each Pursue Their Own Interests, Japan-Germany Relations are Deteriorating, China-Germany Trade Agreement Irritates Japan, Japan Unwilling to Sign Military Alliance

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 31st Dispatch] The recent establishment of a 10 million yuan trade agreement between China and Germany, and the fact that Japan is unwilling to revise the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance, have caused the relations between Japan and Germany to encounter serious threats. Therefore, German trade with China has increased greatly, including a large number of military supplies. Neutral individuals are not surprised by Germany's signing of an agreement with China, believing that Germany is willing to sacrifice its Anti-Comintern Pact alliance to save its own interests. At the same time, it is recognized that German Economic Minister Funk's statement yesterday that he is willing to conduct agreements with any country refers to this China-Germany agreement. It is understood that Japan is considering Germany's trade with China to be a violation of the spirit of the Anti-Comintern Pact and an unfriendly act towards Japan.

### Hiranuma's Speech

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th Dispatch] Tokyo News: After the close of the × Parliament, Hiranuma is starting his political work. His future movements are especially noteworthy. On the afternoon of the 29th, Hiranuma met with his domestic reporter group and expressed many opinions on current domestic and foreign issues. Hiranuma first said, "The basic principles of Japan's foreign policy have already been decided by the previous cabinet and have not been changed so far. However, the specific plan for implementing this basic principle must be changed in order to adapt to changes in the international situation. This is actually difficult to explain in detail, and it is difficult to make people understand without giving concrete examples" (this paragraph is very meaningful, but Hiranuma refused to give examples for discussion). Hiranuma also said, "Japan does not belong to the totalitarian state group, nor does it belong to the democratic state camp, and it is not an enemy of either the totalitarian state or the democratic state camp" (this statement is quite suggestive). A certain reporter asked how the Soviet-Japanese fishery issue is progressing. Hiranuma replied, "There is no reason to be optimistic, but I am not pessimistic." Another reporter asked about the future of the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact and whether Japan needs to issue a statement. Hiranuma only said, "It may be necessary to issue a statement in the future." Hiranuma also admitted that Japan has various difficulties in adjusting its diplomatic relations with Britain, the United States, and France, but because there is a need for adjustment, it must overcome these difficulties, but he did not specify how to adjust. Regarding exchange rate policy, Hiranuma asserted that it is necessary to maintain the ratio of one shilling and two pence. Regarding the future of the war against China, Hiranuma said, "The basic policy toward China has been decided by the previous cabinet, and the current cabinet will continue to implement it. There is no intention to issue a statement, nor is there a need to convene an imperial conference or a joint meeting of the General Headquarters and the cabinet." Regarding domestic issues, Hiranuma said, "Japan has the need to enrich national defense and expand industrial productivity, but this goal cannot be achieved without implementing material mobilization." This seems to imply that depending on the needs of the environment, it may be necessary to implement the National General Mobilization Law, article by article. Finally, Hiranuma said, "The two positions of Minister of Communications and Minister of Colonization in the cabinet are both held concurrently, and people will be selected to fill them soon. This is not a reorganization, and Konoe will continue to serve."

### Soviet Far East Naval Power, Japanese Side Expresses Attention

[Reuters, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] In light of the tense relationship between the Soviet Union and Japan over fishery disputes in the North Pacific, Japan is paying close attention to the Soviet Union's military strength in Vladivostok. According to recent reports, the Soviet Union has seven cruisers stationed in Vladivostok (three with 5,000 to 6,000 tons, four with 3,000 to 4,000 tons), seven destroyers, eighty submarines, one hundred and forty high-speed motorboats, six hundred aircraft, and two thousand aviators.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 31st Dispatch] Hankou News: The US Consulate authorities here have protested to the Japanese side because Japanese planes bombed the American Methodist Church in Shenling, Hubei, during an air raid on the 28th.

### Japan Fuel Panic, Production Increase Plan Still Cannot Be Implemented, Coal Mine Owners Request Implementation of Retrenchment

[Reuters, Tokyo, 31st Dispatch] It is estimated that Japan's industrial needs for coal this year are 60 million tons, an increase of 7 million tons compared to last year. Although the Japan Coal Mine Owners Association has made great efforts to increase coal production, since the implementation of the Goods Supply Control Act, the materials necessary to increase coal production are in short supply and difficult to obtain, so the plan cannot be implemented smoothly. The Mine Owners Association has requested the government to take urgent steps to improve the supply of these materials. Japan's need for coal has increased greatly this year because the government plans to greatly expand the manufacturing industry.

### Occupying the Xisha Islands, Japan Sends Note to France, Wording is Absurd and Outrageous

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 31st Dispatch] According to a statement released by the Japanese Foreign Ministry on Friday, the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, after sending a note to the French ambassador, stated that the Japanese government has sent warships to protect the Xisha Islands, because since 1917, the Japanese economic rights in the area have been unguarded. For the sake of the lives and production of the Japanese people, and to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings by France, the Japanese government has decided to take this step to implement a five-year plan.

### Yunnan Rural Cooperative Association Promotes Cooperative Undertakings, Implements Five-Year Plan

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 30th Dispatch] The Rural Cooperative Committee established by the Yunnan Provincial Government allocated 1 million yuan of national currency from the Fudian New Bank as a fund last year. The province is divided into eleven districts, and it is scheduled to be completed within five years. Work has now begun on the first district (Kun County), the second and third districts (eleven counties around Kaimeng), and cooperative undertakings. As for lending to farmers, it will be temporarily handled by the China Farmers Bank and the Fudian Bank, it is said.

### Radio Stations Transferred Separately

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 28th Dispatch] In accordance with the provisions of the Telecommunications Regulations, the Yunnan Radio Station will now transfer the domestic circuits of the radio to the Telecommunications Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and the international circuits to the newly established International Radio Branch Station. The transfer is scheduled to take effect on April 1.

### Last Telegram: There is Street Fighting in Jiangmen

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 31st Dispatch] On the morning of the 31st, the enemy again landed on North Street with the help of shallow-draft ships and several airplanes. Our army fought bravely, but suffered heavy casualties due to the enemy's intense artillery fire, and the fortifications were completely destroyed, so they retreated to Jiangmen. Until late at night, our troops were engaged in street fighting in Jiangmen City. Also, on the evening of the 29th, after the enemy troops attacking Shaping were severely wounded by our army, more than a hundred were killed, and our soldiers were killed and wounded. All important strongholds in Shaping and other places have been recaptured by our army. Only a few remnants of the enemy are stubbornly resisting.

### Wu Ning Invades Southward

[Central News Agency, Fengcheng, 31st] The enemy occupying Wu Ning continued to invade southward and were ambushed by our troops near Zhongbao, three kilometers south of our Ningcheng. They could not withstand the attack and fled towards Wu Ning.

### Jiangxi Shelters Refugees

[Central News Agency, Ji'an, 31st] As the northern Jiangxi war zone expands and the number of refugees increases daily, the provincial government has ordered all commissioners and county magistrates to provide effective relief and has dispatched multiple commissioners with funds to Linchuan, Ji'an, Zhangshu, Fengcheng, Xinjin, and other counties to arrange for refugee shelter.

### Before and After the Battle of Central Hubei

— Fan Shiqin

(1) Commissioner, County Magistrate, and Wounded Soldiers

[Chongqing Airmail] On the first day of my inspection of central Hubei (February 9th), I first visited Xiangyang. This must be said to be a good sign. Two or three months ago, Xiangyang's hotels, both large and small, were filled with the sounds of mahjong and teeming with prostitutes. Since Commander-in-Chief X strictly prohibited gambling and prostitution, these bad habits have been eradicated completely. This gratifying phenomenon is truly a cause for celebration for the future of the war of resistance.

Commissioner Wu Liangchen, concurrently the Xiangfan Security Commander and Garrison Commander, is very serious about public security. When I met him, he told me that Liu Faguei, a bandit leader who had committed evil in the fourth district of Xiangyang for six years, had been seriously injured and that the fourth district could now live and work in peace, with doors left unlocked at night. Moreover, the rice and wheat produced there are also being transported out in a steady stream.

Commissioner Wu spoke very enthusiastically about the local defense force. He said: "The Xiangyang self-defense force is now engaged in production and training simultaneously because they are all productive individuals. Therefore, a kind of district-based centralized training is being carried out. Many people in northern [Xiangyang] have firearms, but they are all unwilling to let these firearms leave their hands. The current district-based centralized training is precisely in line with the people's wishes (people not leaving their guns, guns not leaving their villages)."

On the misty, rainy second day, I went east to Yicheng. When I sent my name card to the county government to see County Magistrate Chen Yingwu, a young man in his thirties, wearing a gray cloth military uniform and overcoat and looking like a college student, came out. He pointed to himself and said, "I am the county magistrate." On the way, I had heard that the county magistrate of Yicheng had been in office for eight years, was virtuous and honest, and was deeply loved by the people. In my imagination, he would not be such a young county magistrate. He said first: "I am not a county magistrate to be an official, but to do things." "Being a county magistrate is really painful." He frowned: "The various laws and regulations are too restrictive. Currently, county magistrates are generally criticized for being ineffective. Are there no county magistrates with any backbone or brains who are willing to devote themselves wholeheartedly to the country?" His words flowed like a rushing stream after rain. "Indeed, today's county magistrates face many laws, many tasks, and heavy responsibilities, so they are all overwhelmed." He then burst out laughing, "But to come back to the point, being a county magistrate is also interesting. A merchant doing business needs a good signboard to make people believe him; being a county magistrate is the same. If the signboard is loud, the people will trust him. Now, my signboard, whether in the city or in the countryside, still rings loudly."

Education in Yicheng has not been suspended due to the war. Now, a joint primary school has been established in the countryside with more than 300 students. Except for the children of wealthy families who should pay tuition, the government also provides food and books for students from poor families. Teachers receive only ten yuan per month for food, which is entirely a service. This is also a benevolent act of County Magistrate Chen, worthy of admiration."

The Yicheng Self-Defense Force has established a X General Detachment. Each district has a X squadron with a fairly substantial number of people. Half of the expenses are maintained by the government, and half are raised locally. The Baojia [household registration] system is organized and implemented consistently by County Magistrate Chen over eight years, so few problems have occurred.

On the afternoon of the 11th, I visited a certain military hospital. The wounded soldiers' quilts were clean. Because the hospital was appropriately arranged and the doctors changed dressings diligently, it was quite satisfactory. When I was talking to the wounded soldiers, a brother wearing neat clothes suddenly said: "These are all brothers of the X Army. I am a platoon leader. If the brothers are dissatisfied with the hospital, it is I who speak for them. I am not allowed to brothers to cause trouble. Our army has a good reputation, and we must maintain our reputation. The brothers of the X Army observe discipline and love the people wherever they go." I was moved by this platoon leader's words and stood there listening to him. "If we didn't have a good reputation, how could we win battles? The brothers here are all soldiers who defended Sunqiao." I felt as if I had been struck by lightning and couldn't say a word of praise. I also felt that there was immense light in front of me and boundless warmth in my heart.

(2) Visiting a Certain Army Commander

According to the planned schedule, I went to visit a certain army commander on the morning of the 12th. I had met the army commander once last year in eastern Hubei. His heroic personality and frank conversation are still deeply imprinted in my mind. At that time, the war in eastern Hubei was fierce, reaching its peak, and the troops of Army Commander X were facing the front. He said: "We will hold on to the death, one holding on to one, and we will fulfill our responsibility when we are done." These words often floated in my mind, and that day they stirred my mind even more.

Army Commander X's demeanor was as before, and his conversation was even more vigorous. When the army retreated in eastern Hubei, it was responsible for covering the retreat. I asked Army Commander X about the situation of the covering work. According to his answer: "When we were ordered to retreat, we suddenly received an order to hold Yizigang and cover a certain army. But at that time, our troops had already moved back. I grabbed two division commanders and ordered them to hold on tightly. The two division commanders took the chiefs of staff and me to discuss the difficulties. I refused them. On the evening of October 25th, we only had a regiment of people to block the way. At that time, the X people were already in Xinzhou, only fifteen li away from us. The next day there was no gunfire. We thought we could hold on for a few more days. Unexpectedly, the sound of rattling came from the highway. I went out to take a look. A dozen X people's tanks were rushing towards the headquarters. We sent out a 300-person artillery battalion to resist, and as a result, half of them were sacrificed. Later, we went into the mountains. In three days, we didn't eat for two days and fell sixty times. Our clothes were all covered in mud. That's how we got to Yingcheng," Army Commander X said with a smile.

Outside the army headquarters, I saw that the army had a cadre training class, so I asked the army commander about the situation of the cadre training class. The army commander replied: "The training period for cadre training is three months. In addition to teaching the prescribed courses, we also examine the background and academic qualifications of each cadre member and give the cadre members hypothetical wartime situations to answer and deal with."

In the X unit, there are two things that deserve our praise: First, the adjutant wants to organize a price evaluation committee with the local chamber of commerce. After the prices are evaluated, the soldiers pay for their purchases according to the evaluated prices, and there is no dispute between them. Second, all the soldiers' cotton clothes are sewn stitch by stitch by the soldiers themselves. Other units have a shortage of cotton clothes, but X unit is spared this difficulty, so their soldiers are all warm and cozy. (To be continued)

### Chamberlain Announces British and French Military Aid to Poland; British Cabinet Holds Important Meeting; Adopts Strong Measures to Warn Germany

(United Press Association, London, 31st Urgent Cable) Chamberlain announces British and French military aid to Poland.

(Reuters, London, 31st) British Prime Minister Chamberlain entered the House of Commons at 2:50 PM today to deliver an important speech on international events. He was met with cheers from the audience. He said, "This morning, I said that the British government has not officially confirmed the rumors of planned attacks on Poland, so they should not be considered true. I am pleased to take this opportunity to reiterate the government's policy. British policy advocates adjusting relations between the countries concerned and resolving disputes through free means. This is the natural and proper way to resolve disputes. There is no dispute that cannot be resolved through peaceful negotiations instead of force. This House knows that the government is conducting certain consultations with other governments. Before these consultations are concluded, I want to fully demonstrate the position of the British government. I hereby inform this House that during this period, if any action occurs that threatens the independence of Poland, and the Polish government believes that it must resist with all its strength, the British government will immediately provide Poland with assistance and has made this guarantee to Poland. I would also like to state that the French government has granted me the special privilege of clearly stating that the French government is in the same position as the British government on this matter."

[United Press Association, London, 31st] This afternoon, Chamberlain will read an anti-aggression declaration in the House of Commons. It is reported that Poland will have a positive response. In view of the movement of German troops in Silesia, Chamberlain will not wait for the foreign affairs debate next Monday and is eager to issue the declaration. It is expected that Germany will have new anti-Poland threats over the weekend. It is heard that Chamberlain apparently expressed his eagerness to take strong measures against Germany during the cabinet meeting, which surprised many other cabinet members. Home Secretary X and Finance Minister Simon, who advocated opposing strong action, have also changed their attitudes. After the cabinet meeting, Dominion Affairs Minister Inskip informed the representatives of the various dominions of the main steps to be taken in the dominions. Political circles believe that the anti-aggression declaration represents the most important development in British foreign policy in the future. It is believed that it will finally state under what circumstances Britain will not hesitate to go to war. Currently, the British Royal Air Force and Navy are patrolling the North Sea coast day and night. An air raid drill was held in London last night, and searchlights shone into the sky like daylight.

[Reuters, London, 31st] The British Cabinet will meet this morning to approve the draft of Chamberlain's speech to be delivered in the House of Commons at 11:00 AM today. Some early newspapers reported that Britain and France would provide Poland with guarantees and that assistance would be provided in the event of foreign aggression. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that the Prime Minister would issue an unlimited warning to Germany, stating that if Germany takes further acts of aggression in Europe, Britain will resist with all its strength.

[Reuters, London, 30th] The International Labor Organization has issued a declaration urging the governments of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland to immediately implement mutual guarantees and to resist any further aggression by Germany and Italy with all their strength.

[Reuters, London, 31st] Important cabinet members held an unprecedented special meeting at 9:45 AM this morning at the residence on Downing Street. Those present included Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, Finance Minister Simon, Minister for Coordination of Defence Chatfield, Dominion Affairs Minister Inskip, Home Secretary Hoare, President of the Board of Trade Stanley, and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler. It is generally believed that this meeting of key officials was to discuss the contents of an important declaration to be read by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons this afternoon. Its contents will clarify the attitude of Britain, France (or possibly including the Soviet Union) towards Germany's re-aggression, and it is also heard that Britain's attitude towards Poland will be clarified. The cabinet will hold a meeting in the Prime Minister's office in the House of Commons at noon to make the final decision on the declaration so that it can be issued in the House of Commons this afternoon. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to a question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Greenwood, saying that he expected to issue the declaration before 3:00 PM today. Greenwood asked whether the Prime Minister could provide some explanation to dispel doubts due to the rampant rumors. The Prime Minister replied that he had indeed heard rumors, but the rumors had not been confirmed by official information, and the government did not need to accept the rumors. It is learned that the rumors are about mobilization and concentration of troops.

[Reuters, London, 30th] All sectors are very surprised that the cabinet suddenly convened a meeting today. It is generally speculated that this temporary cabinet meeting must have been decided after the Prime Minister met with the King last night. After the cabinet meeting, all ministers related to foreign affairs remained to continue the discussion. According to Reuters' diplomatic reporters, the contents of today's cabinet meeting are absolutely secret and cannot be found out. However, according to reasonable speculation, the government is still determined to maintain and develop its efforts to prevent aggression. In the past forty-eight hours, especially due to the influence of foreign intelligence, the government's views have been particularly strengthened. Due to the authorities' strict secrecy, there are many rumors about how the government will launch in the future, but these rumors can only be regarded as rumors. At the same time, the capitals of the countries concerned, especially Paris and London, are continuing to talk. The Polish ambassador was one of the distinguished guests who visited today and had talks with the Foreign Secretary after the cabinet meeting.

[Reuters, London, Zhou Ri] Reuters' parliamentary reporter said that today's cabinet meeting gave special study to information related to Poland, but the above-mentioned information has still not been considered to have been collected completely, and it is still hoped that British envoy Berkeley will be able to explain the position of Poland. British ministers have unanimously decided to issue an anti-aggression declaration. The reason for the delay in issuing the declaration is that the final draft of the declaration can only be issued after seeking the opinions of France. It is expected that there will be an important announcement in the House of Commons tomorrow morning. At the same time, the government opposition party has not raised any other questions since it raised questions to the government authorities today. This shows that the opinions in the parliament have become fixed. All parties hope that the government authorities can issue this declaration as soon as possible and do not deliberately hinder it during its preparation period.

### Polish Foreign Minister to Arrive in Britain the Day After Tomorrow; In-Depth Discussion of Military Cooperation; Will Also Travel to Paris

[United Press Association, Huidun, 31st] The British government, with cabinet approval, has made a guarantee to Poland that if it is subjected to German aggression, Britain will immediately provide assistance. It is heard that Britain also has a similar guarantee to Romania, but Poland and Romania must provide mutual assistance to jointly resist German aggression.

[United Press Association, London, 31st] According to confirmed news, the British authorities have recently made a unilateral guarantee of Poland's territorial integrity through the embassy in Warsaw. The Polish Foreign Minister will arrive in London next Monday. It is believed that Poland still insists that all agreements should be backed by military agreements. At the same time, according to authoritative sources, Germany has made demands on Poland regarding Danzig, but the Foreign Office here is still trying its best to deny this.

[United Press Association, London, 30th] According to reliable sources, the British government has obtained reports of renewed German military activity on the Polish border. The Polish ambassador visited the Foreign Office this afternoon. It is heard that the recent announcement of increased troops by the British government is to adapt to the proposed anti-German military cooperation with Poland. Today's cabinet meeting was of an emergency nature to review the current situation. When the Polish Foreign Minister visits Britain, he will have in-depth discussions with Chamberlain and Halifax on specific military cooperation. Diplomatic circles point out that this active military measure is a warning to Germany and a guarantee to Poland.

[United Press Association, London, 31st] The diplomatic reporter of the "Daily Herald" here declared that the replies from France and Poland were sent to London on Thursday night, expressing their agreement with the joint British, French, and Polish military assistance to deal with attacks from any direction. The reporter said that Poland's action this time was the result of Germany's demands on Poland two weeks ago. The demands included three items: (1) Poland should change its diplomatic relations, especially with the Soviet Union and Germany; (2) Poland should negotiate with Germany to transfer the Free City of Danzig to Germany, and Germany would guarantee Poland's integrity in exchange; (3) Poland should agree to Germany building a highway in the Polish Corridor directly to East Prussia.

[Reuters, London, 30th] Polish Foreign Minister Beck will arrive in London on April 3. The arrangements for Beck's talks and social schedule after his arrival in Britain have also been arranged. The official schedule will be completed on April 6. If the situation requires it, Beck can return to Poland immediately, otherwise he will stay in Britain for Easter.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 30th] Tonight, the newspapers here are focusing on Foreign Minister Beck's trip to London. The "Observer" said that the rumor that Beck will stop in Berlin on his way to Britain is completely unfounded, because this would simply be enough to show that Poland is willing to abandon its diplomatic freedom due to German pressure. An independent newspaper criticized that the week from Beck's visit to Britain to his return to the country will be a crucial moment to determine the overall situation. Poland's current position in Europe is important, so the whole world is closely watching its actions. President Mościcki had a three-hour talk with the leaders of the main opposition factions tonight to discuss domestic affairs. Poland's national defense bonds have now sold for £1.5 million.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 30th] Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, is scheduled to visit Britain next month. Foreign Minister Bonnet is heard to have asked him to come to Paris on the way, and Foreign Minister Beck has also accepted, but the date has not yet been decided.

[Reuters, Berlin, 30th] Reuters learned from well-informed sources that the rumors about Germany making demands or ultimatums to Poland are all exaggerated. The authorities have not denied that Germany has approached and offered suggestions to Poland, but the rumor that Germany requires Poland to join the Anti-Comintern Pact is still premature. Even the issue of building a highway in the Polish Corridor has not been forced by Germany.

[Reuters, Berlin, 30th] According to well-informed sources here, it is believed that building a highway across the Polish Corridor is not only difficult to construct but also very costly, and at the same time provides a great opportunity for smuggling. Hitler is staying in Bavaria, Goebbels is in Rhodes, Göring is in Italy, and Economic Minister Funk is busy dealing with the affairs of the German National Bank, so there will be no important cabinet meetings or secret meetings here. The press here remains silent about the government's demands and intentions towards Poland.

[Reuters, Berlin, 30th] The German news agency reported that Poland held anti-German demonstrations, saying that the recent anti-German riots in Upper Silesia have intensified. It is claimed that Poles broke into hotels, arrested Germans, and knocked down a person who continued to speak German despite intimidation with a chair.

### Germany's Second Battleship to Be Launched Today; Hitler to Give a Speech in the Afternoon; Will Not Involve Anglo-German Relations

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 31st] Hitler will deliver a speech in Xiximseywen tomorrow afternoon. All parties here are waiting for the speech. Hitler will attend the launch ceremony of Germany's second 35,000-ton battleship, which will be named "Dabis" by the daughter of Admiral Dabis. Hitler will speak at the City Hall at 5:40 PM. It is rumored that he will criticize the Anglo-German disarmament agreement, but German officials deny this. Nazi officials believe that Hitler's speech will not involve Anglo-German relations.

### U.S. Government Hopes for Passage of Revised Neutrality Act; Senator Brown Appointed General Supervisor

[Reuters, Washington, 30th] News obtained by the U.S. government from diplomatic and other sources indicates that the European situation will continue to be tense in the near future. Certain countries are painstakingly trying to pressure democratic countries to have another Munich conference, so the U.S. government hopes to revise the Neutrality Act in the middle of next week in order to obtain "unyielding peace."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 31st] Regarding the "cash and carry" method of the Neutrality Act proposed by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman, the government and diplomatic circles both hope that the Foreign Relations Committee can pass it within two weeks. However, some government officials and senators are taking an extremely cautious attitude. It is said that the implementation of this method is actually tantamount to punishing China, while Japan will benefit from it, because China does not have the means to transport munitions. However, other people say that this method is the only effective way to adapt to the European situation. European countries friendly to China can transport munitions to China from the United States via the Suez Canal and the Burma Road. Currently, American goods cannot be directly transported to China due to Japan's order to blockade the Chinese coast. The government authorities are now clearly eager for Pittman's proposal to be passed as soon as possible, but some senators have expressed strong opposition, and even the government authorities' opinions are extremely divided.

[Reuters, New York, 31st] President Roosevelt has recently appointed former Senator Brown as the General Supervisor. The United States has had no General Supervisor since 1936. Formally Enters Valencia.

### Franco's Troops Formally Enter Valencia

[Reuters, Valencia, 30th] Franco's troops formally entered the city of Valencia today. The streets they passed through were beautifully decorated, and the sides were filled with cheering crowds. It is said that the troops entering were the Galician Division.

[Reuters, St. John Daru, 30th] General Franco's headquarters in Salamanca issued an official report stating that 42 Republican planes surrendered to Franco's troops yesterday. On the Valencia front, nearly 15,000 Republican soldiers were captured, and two entire brigades and six battalions surrendered. In the southern war zone, 70,000 Republican soldiers were captured, and thousands were captured on the Toledo line. In one place, as many as 10,000 Republican soldiers were captured. In addition, a huge amount of Republican military supplies were seized by Franco's troops.

### German Economic Minister Funk Talks About the German-Romanian Agreement

[Reuters, Berlin, 30th] German Economic Minister and President of the National Bank Funk declared today that the new German-Romanian agreement is a "pioneering action." He said that the implementation of the agreement does not contain a "silver bullet" effect. Germany's production capacity has increased, the people's living standards have also improved, and at the same time, Germany's potential exports have also been improved. He then mentioned the currency issue, saying that Germany will no longer allow its economy to depend on internationally manipulated monetary policies. Countries lacking capital will no longer be dependent on foreign debt. They want to step up production, sell products, and increase people's purchasing power.

### Lithuania Approves the Cession of Memel

[Reuters, Li Jing, 30th] Today, the Lithuanian government approved the Lithuanian-German treaty for the cession of Memel.

### Germany and Japan to Conclude Trade Agreement; Negotiations Have Exceeded One Year

[Reuters, Tokyo Correspondence] According to the "Japan Times," Germany and Japan will formally conclude a new trade agreement within the next few months. Negotiations between Germany and Japan have been ongoing for over a year, and both parties have reached agreement on fundamental principles. Details are expected to be finalized within the next two to three months, and it is anticipated that the new agreement can be formally signed in [unspecified] month. In recent years, trade between Germany and Japan has favored Germany. In 1935, Japanese goods sold to Germany were valued at 26,766,000 yen (approximately £1,575,000), while goods purchased from Germany were valued at four and a half times more. In 1938, Japanese exports to Germany were valued at 33,015,000 yen (approximately £2,000,000), while German goods imported into Japan were valued at 171,169,000 yen (approximately over £10,000,000). The significant increase in Japanese imports from Germany is due to Japan's plan to expand its production capacity by importing large quantities of military equipment and materials from Germany. A year ago, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and German authorities began negotiations based on two broad perspectives: one, regarding the supply of goods for Japan's production capacity expansion plan; and two, seeking an improvement in trade balance. It is understood that Japan has achieved some degree of success. The new trade agreement between Germany and Japan will enable Germany to increase its purchases of Japanese goods. During these trade negotiations, Japan strongly desired further concessions from Germany, but Germany pointed out that while German exports to Japan exceeded Japanese imports into Germany, German exports to "Manchukuo" were only a quarter of the value of goods shipped from "Manchukuo" to Germany. Therefore, Germany and Japan believe that trade between Germany and Japan, and "Manchukuo," is actually balanced. German authorities also insisted that Japan should increase its purchases of German goods. Japan, seeking to protect its industries, is currently restricting the import of German goods. Given these differences in opinion, negotiations once reached a stalemate. However, ultimately, Germany and Japan have made mutual concessions, respecting basic viewpoints, and a peaceful resolution agreement will be established. It is said that under this new trade agreement, Japan will have an adequate supply of essential raw materials on the one hand, and be able to increase exports on the other. Recently, Japan's export situation has not been favorable due to pressure from countries such as Britain, the United States, and France. Furthermore, this trade agreement will enable Germany to restore trade in the Far East, which it has already lost. Economic cooperation between Germany and Japan will undoubtedly strengthen the political ties between the two countries. Therefore, it is generally believed here that the trade agreement will further strengthen the diplomatic relations between Germany and Japan. Japan's main exports to Germany are seaweed, canned and bottled foods, vegetable oils, fish oils, cotton textiles, silk textiles, buttons, porcelain, pottery, toys, and rayon, etc. Germany's main exports to Japan are leather, dyes, woolen fabrics, steel, iron, automobiles and their parts, electrical machinery, machinery and their parts, mineral oils, hops, books, and magazines, etc. Visiting French Defenses

### French Chamber of Deputies Resolves to Publish Letter to the Czech People Expressing Deep Sympathy; Czechs in the Americas Plan to Establish a New Country

[Central News Agency, Paris, 31st] The Chamber of Deputies yesterday unanimously passed a resolution to publish a letter to the Czech people, expressing the Chamber's deep sympathy.

[Central News Agency, Chicago, 30th] Bobus Benes, nephew of former Czech President Benes, recently declared here that Czech and Slavic people in the Americas will hold an international conference in Chicago or New York within a month, and plan to rebuild a free Czechoslovak state in a free Europe. 1.5 million Czech and Slovak people in the United States will send representatives to attend, and Czech representatives from various South American countries will also attend. Promoting Supplementation is Under Consideration

### Replenishment of British Regular Army Under Consideration

[Reuters, London, 30th] In the British House of Commons today, someone again questioned Prime Minister Chamberlain on the issue of national defense, asking whether the possibility of universal service had been finally decided against. Chamberlain replied, "In this world, there is no such thing as a final decision." He also responded to a question from Labor MP Fliet Yao, saying that the matter of promoting the replenishment of the regular army is under consideration, and that all aspects of the current situation are constantly being considered by the National Defense Committee. Liberal MP Mandal asked whether the government could immediately prohibit the export of raw materials needed for German military expansion to various autonomous territories and friendly nations. Chamberlain replied, "No." Chamberlain also announced that foreign affairs events would be debated next Monday, and that a few days of recess for Easter could not yet be predicted.

[Central News Agency, London, 30th] When the House of Commons convened this afternoon, Conservative MP Cole inquired whether the British government representative would include the establishment of a permanent Pacific Defense Committee as an agenda item when meeting with representatives of the Australian Federation and New Zealand in New Zealand. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied that the objective of this meeting was to consider matters of common concern, especially national defense issues, but that details could not be reported.

### France and Romania Sign New Trade Agreement

[Reuters, Paris, 30th] France and Romania will sign a new trade agreement tonight. According to the agreement, France will purchase twice the previous amount of kerosene from Romania, and France will reduce import duties on Romanian agricultural products.

### Difficulties Arise in Hungarian-Slovak Border Demarcation

[Reuters, Hungarian Capital, 30th] The conference between representatives of Slovakia and Hungary to negotiate the demarcation of the border between Slovakia and the Ruthenian region suddenly encountered new difficulties today. Slovakia also made a counter-demand to cede territory within Hungary in response to Hungary's territorial claims within Slovakia. Slovakia's demands have been rejected by Hungarian representatives, and therefore, Slovak representatives have stated that they must consult with their government again.

### Italian Prime Minister's Speech: If Germany Marches on Poland, the Axis May Be Difficult to Maintain

[Reuters, Rome, 30th] Italian Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech today, making a unique commentary on the international situation, saying that Italy is unwilling to continue being a prisoner of the Mediterranean. The troubles that the current German-Polish relationship gives Italians are even greater than Daladier's speech. All Italians who are not purely Fascist or extremely sympathetic to the Rome-Berlin Axis believe that the greatest danger in Europe at present lies with Poland. If Germany expresses dissatisfaction with Warsaw's rejection of its proposals and marches on Poland, then this axis may be difficult to bear the burden. Criticizing Daladier's speech, he said that the French have resolutely indicated that they want to close the door to Italy, but Italy is not without patience and will still wait.

Short Commentary

### Yunnan Province's Five-Year Rural Cooperative Plan

Yunnan Province is a vast rear area that supports our country's long-term war of resistance. It occupies a very important position in terms of its abundant manpower, abundant materials, and international transportation relations. Since the war of resistance, under the central government's national policy of "consolidating unity and persevering in the war of resistance," Yunnan Province's loyalty and efforts in all its administrative steps have been even more admirable. A Central News Agency Kunming dispatch on the 30th stated that the Yunnan Provincial Rural Cooperative Committee has obtained 1 million national currency from the Fu Dian New Bank as a fund, and has now decided to divide the province into eleven districts, with the goal of completing rural cooperative undertakings within five years. This move will surely make extremely significant contributions to the war of resistance and national reconstruction.

Our national war of resistance against Japan is being conducted under a special situation, which is that our aggressor is the most powerful imperialist country, and has also been preparing for military aggression against China for decades. Conversely, we are a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country that has long been in a position of inferiority and defeat. Therefore, it has been determined that our war of resistance must rely on the conditions of national consolidation, unity, and long-term warfare in order to win the final victory. The current stage of the war clearly demonstrates that our major cities and transportation lines have been largely occupied, and that the final victory of the war of resistance mainly relies on rural villages and farmers. This is something that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Mr. Mao Zedong have repeatedly proclaimed. Developing rural work and mobilizing the power of farmers are therefore particularly important. Our emphasis on rural cooperative undertakings is also based on this reason.

However, although the power of the farmers is extremely great, and can serve as the ultimate guarantee for the successful war of resistance and national reconstruction, in order to develop rural villages, mobilize farmers, and thus effectively promote rural cooperative undertakings, the most important thing is still to effectively implement improvements in political and economic aspects. Politically, we need a rural movement led from the upper echelons, but this leadership must simultaneously fully embody a democratic spirit, which means constantly paying attention to developing the farmers' initiative and enthusiasm. At the same time, economically, we must first earnestly eradicate the remnants of feudalism, local tyrants, and evil gentry, and earnestly eliminate all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, alleviating the heavy burdens on farmers, and ensuring the necessary improvements in living standards, and then can we enhance the farmers' enthusiasm for participating in production competition. This is a prerequisite for the smooth implementation of rural cooperative undertakings, and also a prerequisite for broadly mobilizing the power of the people to strive for the final victory of the war of resistance. We respectfully hope for this for Yunnan Province, and even more respectfully hope for this for all provinces nationwide. Translated by Yang Bi

### The Situation in Tunisia

— Translated by Yang Bi

Since Italian congressmen made a great commotion in Congress regarding Tunisia on October 3rd of last year, the dispute over Tunisia has openly unfolded, alternately tightening and loosening, and today, it can be considered to be quickly reaching its peak. Here, we provide the historical and geographical background of Tunisia.

The so-called Tunisia is a piece of African land, bordering the Mediterranean Sea to the north, facing the Italian island of Sicily, with only a short distance separating them. This is its location, because there is a narrow strait separating them, just like the Strait of Gibraltar, which connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. It is precisely because the British have stationed sentries in the Strait of Gibraltar that the Italians also hope to establish defenses here.

However, Tunisia was taken by France long ago, which is clearly a major obstacle to Italy's ambitions. If Italy could obtain Tunisia, forming a corner with its own Sicily, and then establish an air base and submarine base in Pantelleria, then it would naturally leap to become the master of the Mediterranean. However, Tunisia is owned by France, and France has already built a large military port in Bizerte. If Italy wants to do something with Tunisia, this will be a fatal wound for them.

Britain naturally sees these strategic plans very clearly. They have always regarded the Mediterranean as an important trade route for the empire, and they cannot allow Tunisia to fall into the hands of Italy, just as they cannot allow Sicily to be transferred to France. In the eyes of shrewd British people, the influence of these two places on the situation in the Mediterranean must be mutually restraining.

France occupied Tunisia as early as 1881. At that time, because the herds of Tunisian natives invaded the neighboring French Algerian territory, France unceremoniously not only drove them out but also occupied Tunisia. Strictly speaking, France did not annex Tunisia. Because until today, Tunisia has not been prefixed with the words "French-owned." France is only in the position of a "protector." The current supreme leader of Tunisia is still their chieftain. All local affairs are managed by the chieftain, while the French-appointed resident officer is fully responsible for issuing orders.

From 1881 to 1896, for fifteen years, Italy consistently refused to recognize France's status as the protector of Tunisia. Italians have always harbored a thought: "France has seized our territory." Because they believe that the pioneers in opening up the territory were the Romans first, and then naturally the Italians. By extension, according to their logic, they believe that the first people to open up Tunisia, the Barbary people, were directly influenced by the immigration trends of Italians and Romans. To put it more plainly, those people "perhaps" were descendants of Italians and Romans.

### Filled with Booming Vitality, Students from All Schools in Hong Kong Hold National Covenant Oath Ceremony. A Heated Swearing-in Ceremony Was Held Last Night at the Confucius Hall. Over a Hundred Schools Participated, with Over a Thousand People Attending.

[Special Correspondent] Last night, the Confucius Hall on Carli Lian Mountain radiated a bright white light in the darkness. The Hong Kong Student Relief Association convened students from all over Hong Kong to hold a swearing-in ceremony for the National Spiritual Mobilization. Over one hundred schools participated, with over a thousand people attending, gathering together, and filled with booming vitality. Slogans were posted all around, providing the attendees with powerful reminders, such as "Reduce unnecessary consumption, remember that reading continues and saving the country is unforgettable, adhere to will, concentrate strength, concentrate faith, do not violate the Three People's Principles, implement collective frugality movements, firmly believe in the Three People's Principles." If everyone can earnestly abide by these, the future of the youth themselves and the nation is unlimited. After the ceremony was performed according to the rituals, the chairman, Li Zhengyao, a representative from the University of Hong Kong, delivered an opening speech, briefly stating that the war of resistance has now developed to a new stage, and that the mobilization of all aspects we need is broader and more universal. Just as the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, said, the people are more important than the soldiers. The status of youth in the nation and society, especially the significant role they play in the spiritual mobilization movement, everyone should abide by the covenant, which has been detailed in the implementation outline distributed by the Student Relief Association. Please pay attention to it and strive to put it into practice. This swearing-in ceremony is just like the enthusiastic advocacy of the youth in the country. We swear today to absolutely abide by the National Covenant, but we must firmly remember that abiding by this National Covenant does not end with the closing of this swearing-in ceremony, but is precisely the beginning of our oath to carry out the National Covenant. From now on, we will implement this covenant anytime, anywhere. We must abandon our past life of young masters and ladies, especially the life of drunken dreams and deathly extravagance and waste. Some classmates have already gotten rid of this habit, but some have not yet overcome it. In short, our lives must not violate the National Covenant, and only on this basis of life can we swear to carry out the National Covenant. Also, we especially note that in the classroom, at home, and in all group rituals, we must promote the spiritual mobilization movement and establish life groups to swear to carry out the National Covenant. Only in this way can we achieve the purpose of spiritual mobilization.

Subsequently, Yang Wugong Association representative Huang Maolin, Overseas Chinese College representative Lin Youren, Nanyang Business College representative Xie Han [name unclear], and Huaxia College representative Xie Gude spoke in succession, and they passionately spoke about the debt burning movement, not reading traitor newspapers, and not cooperating with traitor newspapers. The atmosphere at the venue was very tense. Finally, the presidium announced that the Student Relief Association was scheduled to hold a re-election meeting at the Men's Christian Association at 2:00 PM on April 2nd, hoping that representatives from various schools and guests would participate on time. It was also stated that the Student Relief Association was soliciting membership fees from various schools, which should be one dollar per semester for elementary schools, three dollars for middle schools, and five dollars for universities. The information published in the newspapers some time ago had some omissions. The conference then announced the adjournment after singing songs.

It was also found that Lingdao Girls' Middle School in Hong Kong, in addition to having the heads of departments and teachers in charge of explaining the mobilization outline every day and formulating implementation methods, also believes that spiritual mobilization should first start with eliminating the decadent and lethargic habits in daily life, striving for a reasonable life, and starting from the root to achieve practical results. Therefore, sixty articles of daily life guidelines for members of the youth corps have been specially established and distributed to all students for compliance, as a starting point for spiritual mobilization.

### The Weather Has Been Changing Constantly for Several Days, with Heavy Fog Enveloping Hong Kong. Boats on the Sea Are Suspended, and Vehicles on Land Are Moving Slowly. Two Ships Collided Due to Fog and Returned to Hong Kong Yesterday with Damage.

The weather in Hong Kong has been changing constantly for several days. The fog in the morning is very thick, and the ships sailing on the sea have been greatly affected. Collisions between ships inside and outside the harbor have occurred frequently. Yesterday morning, between 2:00 AM and 8:00 AM, heavy fog fell again, and it was even worse than the previous morning. The entire Hong Kong and Kowloon districts were enveloped in heavy fog. The sea surface was a sheet of dark black. The lights of boats and ships and the lights of residents in Kowloon were covered by heavy fog. Even on land, people could not be identified more than ten feet away. Ping Shan on

Smoke filled the air

The lights on the mountaintop were also dim and colorless. The sea surface was in a state of deathly silence. All large and small ships were suspended. Occasionally, one or two trams were still taking passengers across the sea at risk, but they were only moving at a snail's pace in order to avoid danger. On the Kowloon side, the sound of horns was frequent, making long wailing noises, which were thought to have been issued by small ferries in the typhoon shelter. In Chino Road Central, there were occasional cars coming and going. Due to the thick fog, drivers could not clearly see the road ahead and were unsure of the direction. Although there were headlights, they were also covered by the thick fog, and they had to reduce their speed and move as slowly as people walking. It was not until around 7:00 AM that the heavy fog gradually dispersed, and the entire Hong Kong Island reappeared in its original appearance. However, the heavy fog on the sea surface had not dissipated. Ferries sailing across the harbor still had to travel slowly. Between 6:00 AM and 8:00 AM, the sounds of the ship horns on the sea were incessant. Sea transportation was greatly hindered. It was not until yesterday afternoon that the weather completely cleared up, and the arrival and departure of ships from various ports yesterday morning were greatly hindered. The severity of this was only seen since last summer. Outside Lei Yue Mun, it was not easy to identify objects even within a few feet. From last night to this afternoon, Hong Kong, up to the vicinity of Heng [unclear character] Lighthouse, was covered in heavy fog.

Many foreign ships were blocked

And dared not enter the harbor. For example, the Italian ship Cantewarde, which was originally scheduled to dock last night (the 30th); the North German mail ship Dr. Fan, which was originally scheduled to dock at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 31st); and the troop transport ship Adudoli, which was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong from England yesterday afternoon (the 30th). The Tihsing Line ship Kwangtung and the French mail ship General Xiafei, which collided in heavy fog about 130 miles north of Hong Kong at 9:00 AM on the morning before yesterday (30th), also sailed into the vicinity of Hong Lan with damage in the faint morning light yesterday morning. The ships carried a total of over a thousand passengers. To take advantage of the dissipation of the heavy fog for convenient navigation, they were all arranged in order of priority in the vicinity of Heng Lan. After lunch, the heavy fog began to dissipate, and the ships sailed one after another through Lei Yue Mun into the harbor, and the colliding ships also

Returned to Hong Kong with damage

The Hong Kong agent of the French Post Office, Mr. Ou, personally sailed on a tugboat to Lei Yue Mun yesterday morning to search for the traces of General Xiafei, but after sailing through the heavy fog, it was not easy to identify objects, so he could not find the ship and returned disappointed. It was found that both the Kwangtung and General Xiafei were badly damaged when they collided yesterday. The hull of the Kwangtung had three holes, and seawater was pouring into the ship. Fortunately, the pump was working well, so no tugboat assistance was required. After General Xiafei entered the harbor, he went directly to the Taikoo Shipyard for repairs, while the Kwangtung sailed to the vicinity of another Tihsing Line ship, Zidulu, and stopped there, so that the passengers and cargo on the ship could be transported to the Zidulu in the shortest possible time. It has been decided by the company to match the schedules of the two ships. Therefore, since 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the goods transported from Europe to Shanghai and Japan on the Zidulu had begun to be unloaded in preparation for loading the goods on the Kwangtung for transport to Europe.

### Southern Film Star Chen Yunshang Will Return to Hong Kong the Day After Tomorrow

Southern film star Ms. Chen Yunshang went to Shanghai last year under contract with Shanghai Xinhua Film Company to film, becoming the first person to connect the north and south film routes. She was very popular in Shanghai. Now, Ms. Chen has been away from Hong Kong for several months, and her contract has expired. Her return date is something that general movie fans are eager to know. It has been learned that Ms. Chen sent a telegram back to Hong Kong yesterday, saying that she has booked a ticket on the President Coolidge to return south tomorrow (today), and is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong the day after tomorrow (the 3rd). It is said that people in the South China film industry are now preparing to go to the port to welcome her.

### Taikoo Line Will Reduce Passenger Prices to Help Qiong Refugees Go South to Make a Living. Qiong Overseas Chinese Set Up Shelters in Guangzhou Bay to Accommodate Refugees.

Refugees who escaped from Hainan Island, in order to seek a way out, have been asking the Hong Kong Qiong Overseas Chinese General Association for assistance to go south to Singapore and other places to make a living. The association believes that the number of people requesting assistance is too large, which is beyond the current economic capacity of the association. However, since the matter concerns their hometown, although limited by economic capacity, they should still provide some help. Therefore, they have been actively asking the relevant parties for assistance. Recently, they have obtained the approval from the Taikoo Shipping Bureau to reduce the price of third-class passenger cabins to the old prices. In addition, the quota originally allocated to Haikou has been allocated to Hong Kong. In this way, those who want to go south can enjoy low passenger prices. Also, the association has been increasing the number of refugees fleeing to Guangzhou Bay. In order to save them from suffering from wind and frost, they have specially built a huge shed in the Guangzhou [unclear character] South Road area for accommodation. It is said that construction has already begun, and it will be available in the near future.

### Peninsula Detectives Mobilized En Masse to Strictly Eliminate Banditry; Days of Separate Investigations into Opium Dens and Gambling Houses; Many Suspect Buildings and Boats Searched

In recent months, the occurrence of robbery cases in Hong Kong has been incessant, especially in the Kowloon Peninsula, where they are perceived to be more frequent. This is because the Peninsula has a vast area, making it easier for unscrupulous individuals to hide and operate compared to other locations, and easier to escape after committing a crime. However, this seriously affects the peace of life and property of the Peninsula's residents. Therefore, the Kowloon Residents Association has repeatedly expressed its request to the police authorities to quickly strengthen the security forces in the Peninsula and strictly maintain public safety.

Serious Investigation of
Opium Dens and Gambling Houses

Yesterday, this newspaper's reporter received information from the police that the police authorities have paid great attention to the particularly rampant bandits in the Peninsula. After careful consideration, they have decided on a comprehensive plan to deal with the situation and rigorously eliminate bandits hiding in the Peninsula to ensure the safety of residents. The most important aspect of this plan involves several approaches. General opium dens, mahjong parlors, "heavenly nine" games, gambling houses, and other lower-level establishments are places where bandits often gather. In addition to planning to crack down on them, the police have first ordered detectives from all districts of the Peninsula to seriously investigate the movements of individuals in these establishments. For the past two weeks, detectives from police stations in various districts of the Peninsula have been acting on orders to promote this work, investigating individuals in opium dens and gambling houses day and night. Anyone found to be suspicious is immediately detained and interrogated.

Suspect Residences
Searched Extensively

Secondly, the police have also begun investigating general buildings and residences, as well as the large and small boats docked in the Yau Ma Tei typhoon shelter. Whether it's a building or a boat, if any suspicious signs are discovered, it will be surrounded and searched, and the residents inside will be strictly investigated. If there is no sufficient reason to prove that they are law-abiding citizens, they will be dealt with according to the aforementioned procedures. It is estimated that in the past week, buildings in Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, Sham Shui Po, Hung Hom, Kowloon City, and other districts have been searched by detectives, and suspected residents have been taken back to the police station for questioning. Especially, many large and small boats in the typhoon shelter have been searched. In addition to the various measures mentioned above, it is imperative to strengthen the police security forces in the Peninsula. The police authorities have now decided to increase the number of uniformed police officers in various districts of the Peninsula, and the number of both Chinese and Indian police officers will be sufficiently increased according to the situation. The number of Chinese and Western detectives will also be appropriately increased. Furthermore, it is stipulated that every night, the Yau Ma Tei Police Station will dispatch armored vehicles and motorcycle strike teams to patrol the streets and conduct secret security. The number of these strike teams will also be increased, it is said.

### The Sea Dragon Sailboat Suddenly Goes Missing in a Storm

American writer Richard Halliburton, navigator John Wauchope, and twelve others departed from Hong Kong on March 4th aboard the "Sea Dragon" sailboat, attempting to cross the Pacific Ocean to participate in the Golden Gate Exposition, taking the route from the China Sea to Taiwan, along Guam, Midway Island, Wake Island, and the Pan American Airways route. Recently, it suddenly went missing. The ship's representative in San Francisco has requested the U.S. Navy to dispatch a ship to search for it. The ship is equipped with a short-wave radio generator. The last radio report was received on Friday of the previous week, stating that it was encountering windstorms en route to Midway Island, and no further signals have been received since. It is unclear whether it has been in an accident or whether the generator is damaged and cannot be repaired. According to the ship's former companion, reporter Botterweg, based on the situation, the ship may not have encountered an accident, or it may be due to the radio being damaged and unable to be repaired, which is also possible. He also said that he received a telegram from the ship when it arrived at Midway Island last week, it is said.

### A Meeting with Regiment Commander Lin Shu, Leader of the Guangxi Student Army

— Qi Zhuo

Accompanying the "China Salvation Drama Troupe" to Visit Overseas Chinese

The Analysis of the War of Resistance in Combination with Drama Propaganda

Resisting the Japanese invasion is the urgent demand of every Chinese. Feeling discouraged upon hearing of defeats is a common problem among those with superficial views. Therefore, when the Salvation Drama Troupe was about to extend its salvation propaganda from the front lines to overseas, it requested the authorities to send a military expert to accompany the team, so that in the midst of the drama propaganda, it could also provide an analysis of the current war situation, so that the vast number of overseas Chinese would strengthen their belief in the victory of the war of resistance and not be shaken or discouraged by the gains and losses of a single city or place. This request was generously granted by the authorities. Therefore, Lin Shu was sent to accompany the team to visit overseas Chinese. When reporters visited the Salvation Drama Troupe a few days ago, they also met Mr. Lin and the two team leaders, Jin and Wang, working very closely together. The valuable material we found was truly overwhelming.

Mr. Lin was full of energy and spoke very boldly. In the Battle of Xuzhou, he served as the director of the political department of a certain division. Later, he participated in several fierce battles in the Fifth War Zone, and his experience gained from practice was very rich. Due to a foot injury, he temporarily suppressed his surging emotions of resisting the war and returned to Guangxi for treatment. Because his injury had not yet fully recovered, the Guangxi authorities did not allow him to go to the front lines again, but instead kept him in Guilin to serve as the commander of the First Regiment of the Guangxi Student Army.

The Student Army in Guangxi

Guangxi, a province with a population of more than 13 million, has mobilized nearly 500,000 armed soldiers since the start of the war of resistance, making it the province with the highest proportion in the country. The Guangxi Student Army is the force driving this high tide.

On November 7th last year, the training of the Guangxi Student Army continued with the same heroic spirit as in the past and began.

The members of the Student Army include graduates and students from universities and middle schools, all of whom have voluntarily abandoned their studies to join the army to save the country from danger. Their patriotic enthusiasm is like a flame, and they can endure any hardship in their lives. They are truly rare young people. Their treatment is the same as that of first-class soldiers, with a monthly military salary of 8.5 yuan, including food and all expenses. Young masters, if they heard this, should feel ashamed of themselves!

Each regiment of the Guangxi Student Army has 1,700 people, and there are currently three regiments, with a total of more than 5,100 people, including 500 women. Some people say that seeing the situation in Hong Kong, China would have already been destroyed! Seeing the situation in Guangxi, the revitalized new China is just around the corner. – This is not without its reason. In fact, the spirit of Guangxi is also sprouting and growing in various provinces and corners of the country.

The commander-in-chief of the Guangxi Student Army is General Xia Wei, concurrently, and the deputy commander is Zheng Changfan. The commander of the First Regiment was originally Mr. Lin Shu. This time, Commander Lin was ordered to accompany the China Salvation Drama Troupe to go abroad for propaganda, and Huang Guannan succeeded him as the commander of the regiment. The commander of the Second Regiment is Li Guangbao, and the commander of the Third Regiment is Jiang Huang. After two months of training, the Student Army continues to receive training while engaging in practical work. Each village is assigned a company of 150 people to receive training and provide services. The object of service is to assist the original "Trinity" organization in mobilizing the people, organizing the people, and educating the people. Guangxi's lack of desertion, the lack of problems with troop replenishment, and various scorched-earth resistance plans, such as destroying roads and dispersing the population – all have thorough preparations, and the Student Army is the backbone of these efforts. It can be known that as long as the responsible authorities are enlightened, able to trust young people, and educate young people, the power of young people is a great power. Mr. Lin also said that recently another group of young people have requested to enlist in the army for training, and the fourth regiment is about to be established. Young people – vigilant young people – are truly lovely!

Bringing the True Evidence of the Inevitable Victory of the War of Resistance to Overseas

Regarding Mr. Lin's task of accompanying the drama troupe abroad this time, in addition to comforting overseas Chinese and encouraging them to contribute money and effort, it also focuses on analyzing the current war situation. Using the true and solid progress made in all aspects, and various accurate figures, to prove that the final victory is absolutely guaranteed. Overcoming the childish disease of being discouraged by the loss of a city or place. It is also particularly important to explain that our strategy has absolutely not changed, and we will absolutely not compromise halfway. As for the Japanese, they have been disappointed many times and have changed their strategies many times. At the beginning of the war, the Japanese thought that they could "win without fighting" like the "September 18th Incident." After our heroic resistance, they realized that "winning without fighting" was impossible, and changed to "quick battle and quick resolution." After our increasingly courageous efforts, they realized that "quick battle and quick resolution" was impossible and changed to "quick peace and quick resolution." The Japanese warlords saw that puppet organizations were not easy to establish, and that traitors were being shot by patriotic people one after another; Wang Jingwei's peace talks were so unpopular – they knew that "quick peace and quick resolution" was impossible, and therefore arrogantly uttered the nonsense of a "century-long war." What is a century-long war? Isn't it just a trick that has been transformed by "outward strength and inner weakness" and "unable to sustain"? As long as we are united in sincerity from top to bottom, and resist the war to the end, victory is in sight.

### Tense Situation in Siyi, Zhongshan; Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Temporarily Suspend the Transport of Cheap Rice; Zhongshan Representative Returns to Hong Kong Yesterday to Report on the Situation; Chaozhou and Shantou Rice Stones are Continuously Transported In, and the Rice Famine Can Be Resolved

Since the Ministry of Finance approved tax-free quotas for foreign rice, overseas Chinese groups in Hong Kong, concerned about food supplies in their hometowns, have been planning to transport large quantities of foreign rice back to their hometowns to sell at low prices to provide relief. However, recently, due to the emergency of the war in Jiangmen, various overseas Chinese groups are afraid of obstacles in shipping and have been forced to wait for an opportunity before proceeding. The Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce recently resolved to allocate HK$20,000 to purchase rice for cheap sales. The method is to purchase and transport foreign rice to Macau, set a price, and then notify the village chiefs of each village to prepare funds to go to Macau to purchase and transport it back to their villages for cheap sales. It is learned that the association's representatives, Gu Zhuolun and Guo Hanting, went to Macau twice this week to return to Qi and met with County Magistrate Zhang to discuss the transportation issue. They returned to Hong Kong yesterday after completing their tasks. They told reporters about the experience of this trip, saying that after returning to Qi, they also invited County Magistrate Zhang, but Jiangmen happened to have a war, and the coastal situation in Zhongshan was tense. According to the county government's opinion, the village chiefs must plan the defense affairs of each village and have no time to take care of preparing funds for grain transportation. They must wait for a later date to handle it. The Overseas Chinese Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce has specially scheduled a meeting on Sunday this week to discuss and decide. Hong Kong overseas Chinese from Siyi and Heshan originally planned to purchase and transport the first batch of tax-free foreign rice through Jiangmen to various villages for cheap sales within a few days, but due to the impact of the Jiangmen war the day before yesterday, they were afraid that the rice stones would be intercepted if transported, so even those who had purchased it temporarily suspended the transportation. Since the tax exemption, rice merchants have been purchasing large quantities of foreign rice and shipping them in. According to people from the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce, the actual number of people coming in is extremely difficult to estimate, but in recent days, the price of rice in Shantou has dropped, and the rice famine can be resolved soon.

### Eastern Front Triumphant News; Division Commander Huang Tao Annihilates Over a Thousand [Illegible Character]; Our Planes Fly Over Shilong and Shitan; Yesterday, the Enemy in Zengcheng Reinforced and Attempted to Invade Kenkou; The War is Progressing on All Fronts; We Hold the Advantage

[Hui Special Dispatch] On the Eastern River front, under the command of General Wu Qiwai, Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth Army Group, the various large units have been dispatched and are cooperating well with the various teams under the Third Guerrilla Area Command, advancing steadily towards Zengcheng. A few days ago, the enemy in Zengcheng sent teams twice to harass the area under the jurisdiction of Boluo County and at the same time to carry out reconnaissance missions in an attempt to ascertain the strength of our army. After our army defeated the enemy separately, it took advantage of the situation to press and severely damage them. The details are as follows:

Circling Around Zhengguo, Over a Thousand Enemies Killed

On the 30th, our army's Huang Tao unit circled around from a certain place and arrived at Paitan Zhengguo with a rapid march, attacking the enemy frontally. Another regiment of the Huang unit joined forces in Boluo with the various brigades of Xia Zhiyang, Mo Junsheng, and Chen Nan under the First Detachment of the Third Guerrilla Area Command, starting from Lianhexu, Changning, Longhua, and other places, crossing Niupi Trail, Lychee, and Bogong[illegible character] in three routes, taking the right wing of the enemy army in Zengcheng. The Huang unit encountered the enemy south of Zhengguo, and a fierce battle ensued. The enemy reinforced three times and was unusually stubborn. The Huang unit fought bravely, using skillful tactics and rapid movements, and defeated the enemy in the afternoon of that day, killing more than a thousand enemy puppet troops and capturing many military supplies. The news of the victory has reached the Shen Office there and the headquarters of the Third Guerrilla Area Command. The unit is currently pursuing. In addition, the Lin and Chen units under the First Detachment are currently fighting fiercely with the enemy in eastern Zengcheng for days. The battle situation is fierce, and the outcome is uncertain. Our army still holds the advantage.

Our Planes Bomb Shitan and Shilong Fiercely

On the same day, the Third Guerrilla Area Command, according to Dongguan intelligence, at about 2:00 PM on the 30th, 18 of our planes, divided into two layers and six teams, with fighter escorts bombing planes, appeared over Shilong. Because they flew in from high altitude, they only descended rapidly after reaching Shilong. The enemy army was caught off guard, and they hurriedly collected the flags and fired with machine guns. Our planes flew back and forth, taking the risk of flying low to drop bombs. Eight bombs were dropped in Shilong and six bombs were dropped in Shitan, and leaflets were scattered. Our planes completed their mission and flew away safely. According to investigations, the enemy suffered heavy losses, and the people in Shilong also suffered damage.

The Enemy Reinforces and Attacks East to West

As of yesterday, the 31st, our units advancing to suppress the enemy on the front and sides of Zengcheng are still in fierce battles, and each unit has made progress. According to continued intelligence, the enemy in Zengcheng has increased slightly, transferred from Guangzhou. On the morning of the 31st, more than a thousand enemy troops, accompanied by twenty large and small cannons, started from [illegible character] City and reached the Tangcun area, appearing to be invading Kenkou. It is estimated that their intention is to attack east to west and divide our forces. Our army is strong and has seen through their cunning plan and has sent teams to intercept them. The enemy will definitely not succeed.

### Two Gains, Two Losses: Stalemate in Jiangmen, Extremely Heavy Casualties, Retreat to Ronggui, Traitorous Insiders Being Purged

[Reuters, Shekki, 31st] According to Chinese reports, since General Zhang Fakui's Guangxi army arrived, Japanese forces near Jiangmen have suffered extremely heavy casualties and retreated last night. It is said that the enemy army is using Rongqi and Guizhou as strongholds.

[Shekki Express News] After landing at Zhutou on the 28th, on the morning of the 29th, the enemy received reinforcements from Jiujiang and launched another fierce attack on North Street in Jiangmen. At 1:45 PM, they indeed invaded the urban area. Our reinforcements arrived around 3:00 PM and surrounded the enemy. By around 6:00 PM, all enemy forces within the city had been completely wiped out. This was confirmed by military intelligence from the Zhongshan guerrilla authorities. On the 30th, fierce fighting continued, resulting in a stalemate. On the 29th, when 28 enemy aircraft bombed Jiangmen, our heroic air force bravely engaged them in combat. Details are as follows:

Sweeping the City, Capturing Waihoi

It was found that on the 29th, over a thousand enemy soldiers, accompanied by small cannons, arrived from Jiujiang on shallow-water vessels to reinforce Waihoi. Our troops resisted desperately, and both sides engaged in repeated fierce battles. At one point, our defenses were completely destroyed, and we withdrew from Waihoi. The enemy forces then divided their forces, advancing along one route across the river to attack North Street, continuing towards Dongpaotai. At 1:45 PM, they invaded the Jiangmen urban area. Our loyal and brave garrison troops fought desperately in hand-to-hand combat, charging back and forth. Around 4:00 PM, our main force arrived from Heshan to reinforce us. From Zhongshan, the commander of the First Special Operations Detachment, Yuan, led his troops to defend Guzhen, shelling the enemy across the river at Waihoi. Hearing of the arrival of reinforcements from the National Army, our troops were emboldened. The commander of the Fifth Guerrilla Zone, Li Wuzi, the deputy commander, Zhou Hanling, and the guerrilla detachment leader, Yuan Yangqing, launched a large-scale counterattack. The sound of gunfire shook the sky, and eventually, the enemy forces within the city were annihilated. The remaining enemy forces retreated to Dongpaotai. We pursued our victory, and the remaining enemy forces, unable to withstand the attack, retreated to North Street. We advanced from Shuinan, defeated the enemy, and then crossed the river, recapturing Waihoi. The situation at the North Gate has stabilized somewhat.

Our Aircraft Assist in Battle, Morale Doubles

When the enemy forces attacked Jiangmen, 28 enemy aircraft coordinated with the ground troops, fiercely bombing our city. Unexpectedly, our heroic "Divine Eagle" team suddenly appeared over Jiangmen, launching a fierce attack on the enemy aircraft. The enemy aircraft responded in a panic. Although victory or defeat was not determined, our land troops, seeing the national aircraft in action, were greatly emboldened, thus forming the results of this battle. Currently, enemy ships are patrolling at Dieshi and Yinggezui in Zhongshan. In Ronggui, our two armies are still engaged in fierce fighting. Xiaolan is still firmly defended by our Yuan's unit. Our 13 aircraft bombed the enemy in Ronggui on the 29th, causing significant losses to the enemy. On the morning of the 30th, the enemy, unwilling to give up, continued to attack North Street and other places, sending aircraft to bomb. Somehow, more than ten traitorous plainclothes agents infiltrated and caused chaos from within. Therefore, rumors spread that we were attacked again. Later, our troops purged the traitors and continued to fiercely attack the Japanese army. The battle situation in North Street and Shuinan was chaotic, with both sides advancing and retreating, forming a stalemate. Overall, the enemy has been sending reinforcements by waterway for the past two days. Rumors that the enemy is attacking from Tangxia are absolutely inaccurate.

Various Places Bombed, Refugees Flee

During the enemy aircraft's assistance in the battle over the past two days, they flew to Erqu Shuinan, Baisha, Qipang Village, and Shazaiwei, Sanqu Huangzhuang Village, and other places, dropping over a hundred rounds of killing bombs, destroying countless civilian houses and causing heavy casualties. Refugees from Haiwai, Zhutou, Lile, Baisha, and Shuinan are unable to escape due to severed transportation routes. Some are fleeing to Kaiping, Danshuikou, and Sanbu. As for Zhongshan, after the fierce battles in Jiangmen, its defenses have also become tense. The enemy also harasses the Shachou and Da Xiaohuangpu areas of the Xiaolan River from time to time. They have been repeatedly defeated by our First District Guerrilla Special Operations Detachment stationed there, and the people's hearts are still at ease. The county authorities are now engaged in evacuating the population.

### Enemy Aircraft Run Rampant, Indiscriminately Bombing Various Places in Hepu, Dozens of Shops Destroyed in Liancheng, Two Enemy Aircraft Wounded by Us

[Beihai Express News] For the past ten days, continuous spring rain has fallen here, and enemy aircraft have rarely come to harass us. The market has been peaceful. However, yesterday, the 22nd, as soon as the sky cleared, enemy aircraft became active again, flying to various places to cause trouble. At 1:00 PM on the 22nd, seven enemy aircraft flew to attack Beihai, Dijiao, Liancheng, and other places. Four bombs were dropped at Dijiao, all of which missed their targets, causing no losses to us. Fifteen schools of bombs were dropped at Liancheng, with four bombs landing near the Da Zhulan (Big Pig Pen) in Qinzhou Lane, destroying over ten civilian houses; and four bombs landing in the Fumin Road area, destroying over thirty civilian houses. In total, twelve people were injured and two people died. When the enemy aircraft bombed Liancheng, our air defense forces immediately fired anti-aircraft guns and cannons at the enemy aircraft. The enemy aircraft also fired machine guns at our air defense forces' positions at low altitude and dropped bombs. After about ten minutes of fierce fighting, two enemy aircraft were wounded by us and fled away escorted by two enemy aircraft. Also, on the 24th and 25th, three or two enemy aircraft at a time flew over Beihai, Liancheng, Guantouling, Gaode, and Qanti in batches, circling in the air to scout, but did not drop any bombs.

### Seventh District Special Commissioner's Proclamation: Prohibition of Rice Exports

[Maoming Express News] Zhang Yan, the administrative commissioner of the Seventh District, has, due to the soaring rice prices in the counties under the district's jurisdiction, the reason for which is not only the difficulty in obtaining supplies, but also the fact that unscrupulous merchants are smuggling exports for profit, found it necessary to maintain food supplies for the military and civilians in the district and to prevent unscrupulous merchants from funding the enemy. He has submitted a request to the provincial government to ban rice exports. A proclamation has been issued and is now being implemented. The proclamation is recorded as follows: Rice is the staple food of the people. When supply and demand are balanced, society tends to be stable. Maintaining the people's food supply and stabilizing society is of utmost urgency. Recently, rice prices in this district have soared, which affects the people's food supply and disrupts society. The reason for this is due to supply falling short of demand, and it is also feared that a few unscrupulous merchants are smuggling exports to fund the enemy and make profits. Strict prohibition should be implemented to maintain the people's food supply. Therefore, this office orders each county to dispatch self-defense teams to block the coastal areas and strictly prohibit the export of rice. Those who dare to deliberately violate this order will be arrested, and the rice will be confiscated. However, within the scope of this district's counties and cities, rice is still allowed to circulate as usual to facilitate adjustment. In addition to separate orders, a circular proclamation is issued for widespread knowledge.

### News from the Foshan Ferry: Guangzhou Increasingly Chaotic, Wounded and Dead Japanese Soldiers Continuously Transported from Jiangmen to the City, Residents Remaining in the City Treated Like Fish and Meat

The Foshan ferry of the Hong Kong, Canton and Macau Steamboat Company, which departed on the morning of the 29th of last month, replacing the Jinshan ferry on the route to Guangzhou, did so in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese agreement of two sailings per week. The ferry, after arriving in the province, remained moored at the Taikoo Dock Bridge for two days, and returned from the province yesterday morning, arriving at Pupu at 5:20 PM in the afternoon, berthing at the Hong Kong, Canton and Macau Steamboat Company's wharf. It was found that a total of over 1,100 passengers boarded the ferry to Hong Kong, with Westerners accounting for very few. Both the twelve-dollar, eight-dollar and five-dollar berths were sold out and extremely crowded. This is vastly different from when the ferry previously departed for the province, when the number of passengers was very small, showing that the situation in Guangzhou is becoming increasingly chaotic, and many citizens consider it best to leave as soon as possible. A reporter boarded the ferry yesterday to investigate. According to the passengers, regarding the recent situation in Guangzhou:

Our Army About to Launch a Large-Scale Counteroffensive

In recent days, our heroic oblique eagle team has appeared over Guangzhou from time to time, launching heavy bombings on the Japanese military areas and distributing leaflets, declaring that our various armies are about to launch a large-scale counteroffensive, instructing residents of the city to leave the city as soon as possible to avoid being caught in the crossfire. The enemy strictly prohibits citizens from picking up such leaflets, and those who violate this order are beaten. However, many leaflets have already been circulated among the residents, who are informing each other to disguise themselves and leave the city, so the situation is more chaotic than before, and people are anxious and restless.

Wounded and Dead Japanese Soldiers Streaming into the City

Currently, after the Japanese army invaded Ronggui, they continued to invade Jiangmen, and the Japanese army's military transport in Guangzhou is extremely busy. On the Pearl River, electric boats travel frequently, transporting military supplies, and wounded and dead Japanese soldiers are continuously transported from the war zone back to Guangzhou. It is speculated that the number of casualties is indeed not small. Yesterday (the 30th), at noon, the Japanese army in the city suddenly ordered martial law. From the Tianzi Wharf on the South Bund to Hanmin Road, there were Japanese soldiers stationed on guard, and pedestrians were not allowed to pass, and the situation was very serious. After investigation, it was found that several thousand wounded Japanese soldiers were transported back from Xijiang in dozens of civilian boats and landed at Tianyu Wharf, where dozens of Japanese trucks took turns transporting them to rear hospitals. It was also heard that there were two senior officers among the wounded, who were also seriously injured. The transportation was not completed until night. Also, when the Foshan ferry was navigating the waters near Lianhua Mountain, it encountered six Japanese electric boats, each towing three to five civilian boats, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers. It is generally believed that they were Japanese reinforcements invading Jiangmen.

Bandits Rampant, Robbery in Broad Daylight

As for the situation in Guangzhou, it is even more chaotic than before. Currently, merchants, under the threat of the Japanese, painfully resume business, but banditry is rampant in the city, and many shops are looted. Initially, this mostly occurred at night, but recently it has become more and more fierce, with bandits running rampant in broad daylight, treating Japanese soldiers and police as if they were nothing. Three days ago, on a certain street in the west of the city, dozens of bandits controlled the street head and street tail, carrying out a large-scale looting. A Japanese soldier happened to patrol by and was captured, beheaded, and his head was hung high on an electric pole before the bandits leisurely left. Merchants, because of the loss of their capital, cannot withstand the looting, so most of them have closed their businesses. The Japanese, knowing that they have no great protection, can only do nothing. In total, the number of shops in the city has decreased by as much as five-tenths compared to the previous month. Those that have not closed down mostly engage in several businesses concurrently. There are funeral homes that also sell firewood and rice, and butcher shops that also sell vegetables. The order is extremely chaotic, comparable to the small market towns in remote rural areas.

Citizens Arriving in Shanghai Subjected to Harsh Treatment

The rampant behavior of bandits is not only for shops and households, but also for the Japanese, who are sometimes subjected to armed robbery. Foreigners entering the city from Shameen are also sometimes targeted. And the purpose of robbery, regardless of the amount, even those who have two or three corners in their pockets to go to a teahouse for a drink are robbed. Therefore, residents, even during the day, mostly do not dare to go out to avoid robbery. Therefore, except for three or five pedestrians on three or five main roads, there are no pedestrians on the side streets and alleys. Even in broad daylight, it is like a ghost town. The citizens who took the ferry to Hong Kong this time were subjected to harsh treatment by the Japanese when leaving the city. In addition to paying a large sum of money to the Japanese headquarters to obtain an exit permit, they must also undergo various inspections. Any slight hesitation will result in the refusal to issue a permit. When boarding the ferry, a large team of Japanese soldiers was stationed on the pier to search. Any slight carelessness would result in insults. Even Westerners were not spared. A Westerner on the same ferry this time was stopped by the Japanese soldiers when boarding the ferry from the吊橋. The Westerner questioned it slightly, and the Japanese soldiers ignored him and used their fists and feet. The Westerner could only do nothing. In short, present-day Guangzhou has been occupied by bandits and the Japanese, and the residents who remain in the city are no different from fish and meat on a chopping board, subjected to unbearable suffering.

### Zhang Huichang Actively Consolidating the Defense of Zhongshan, Preparing to Destroy Roads to Prevent the Enemy from Invading, Reports of Macau Restricting Refugee Entry Inaccurate

[Zhongshan Express News] After the fall of Rong(qi), Gui(zhou), Zhongshan, due to its adjacent territory, suddenly became tense. Zhang Huichang, the county magistrate of Zhongshan and deputy commander of the First District Guerrilla Force, in order to protect the integrity of the territory, has decided on an overall strategy to deal with the situation. He has decided to launch a pre-emptive strike against the enemy to curb their ambition. It has been determined that the strike force has been designated and has begun to advance to its destination. The various situations are recorded as follows:

Counterattack on Ronggui

In order to crush the Japanese army's ambition to invade Zhongshan, Deputy Commander Zhang has been consulting with Shi Baoqi, the commander of the Zhongshan Garrison Headquarters, and Yuan Dai on the plan to counterattack Ronggui and consolidate the coastal defense measures. It has been designated that Yuan's guerrilla unit will be the vanguard. It has been found that Yuan has convened a counterattack meeting in Xiaolan yesterday, summoning the heads of various units, Liang Zhuowen, Qu Zeren, etc., to discuss the counterattack plan, and has ordered the teams in Xiaolan Qianjie, etc., to prepare their weapons and wait for orders to attack. It has been found that the number of Japanese troops entrenched in Ronggui is not large, and they are under the strict control of our teams, having become a turtle in a jar. It should not be difficult to annihilate them in one fell swoop and recover Ronggui to strengthen the vanguard of Zhongshan.

Destroying Roads

The Zhongshan County authorities believe that since our army has retreated to Ronggui, the Japanese have repeatedly attempted to invade Zhongshan. Full preparations should be made for various wartime operations. It is believed that the Qiqi Highway, the eastern trunk line, is adjacent to the sea. To prevent any eventuality, preparations have been made to completely destroy it, and orders have been issued to the township heads along the road to collect villagers to assist in the implementation of the work.

Defense is Safe

Although the situation in Zhongshan is currently tense, the defense is as peaceful as usual. The external rumors are all rumors. However, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, the masses have decided to continue to evacuate the elderly, weak, women, and children to safe areas as much as possible. As for the reports that the Macau authorities are restricting the entry of refugees, it has been found that this is inaccurate. On the 31st, the vehicles on the Qiqi Highway were extremely crowded, and the masses walking along the highway through Qianshan to Macau were also in an endless stream. It has also been found that Xiangzhou, Doumen, Da Huangpu, and Qirencun along the coast were all quiet on the 30th and 31st. No Japanese warships have come to disturb them.

### Special Shipping News

For days, thick fog has shrouded the sky, making navigation dangerous. The French mail ship General Joffre and the British mail ship Guangzhou, which collided outside the harbor the day before yesterday morning, were scheduled to return to Hong Kong. However, from morning to dusk yesterday, the fog grew thicker, and the two ships were unable to enter the harbor and were forced to stop. At the same time, the Yuezhou, Chengdu, and Bianwo, three ships entered the port between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM yesterday. It was not until 7:00 PM that the Boschdijk, handled by the American-East Asiatic Company, slowly entered the harbor. The Italian mail ship Conte Verde and the Ben Line's Guangzhou also entered the harbor in succession at 8:30 PM and are now docked at the Kowloon Wharf.

Also, although the fog was thick yesterday, the outgoing ships were not greatly affected. However, the French mail ship Chidru, which was originally scheduled to depart for Shanghai at noon the day before yesterday, did not depart because of the incident with the Guangzhou. According to the company's message, it is planned to transfer the passengers and cargo of the Guangzhou to the Chidru to transport them to Europe, so as not to delay the arrival date of the passengers and cargo. After the Guangzhou arrives in Hong Kong, it must enter the repair yard. As soon as it is repaired, it will replace the Chidru to Shanghai, Japan, and other places.

Film and Drama

### The New Little Song Queen, Betty Jaynes, Has Been Signed by MGM

Miss Betty Jaynes, who is only fifteen years old, was an ordinary female student a few weeks ago, but now she has been recognized as the youngest song queen in the world. It is remembered that her first performance in the Chicago Opera Company was singing the role of leader in La Boheme, and she immediately became famous and was loved by the audience. Now Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has signed a contract with her, and she can be asked to sing and act at any time. This makes her mother very happy, because she had long hoped that her daughter would have a day to live in Hollywood.

At the same time, Betty's appearance in opera also fully satisfied the proud desires of her father before his death. Her father was a dentist in the south of Chicago, and because his daughter had a beautiful high-pitched voice, he was very proud of her. Who knew that when Betty was eleven years old, he passed away due to pneumonia. So, two years ago, her mother came to fulfill her father's wishes and sent Betty to an acoustician. This gentleman was amazed by her talent, and then introduced her to Mrs. Delus, who is a photography studio owner and a famous singing teacher. She was also moved by Betty's singing, and after letting the band leader of Grant Park listen, she invited her to participate in the singing program, which formed a sign of her early fame. On the one hand, Mrs. Delus also invited Mr. Paul Wenlang to listen to Betty's singing. He is the general manager of the Chicago Opera Company. This was a really powerful recommendation. Betty was hired to step onto the stage.

In the months before Betty was about to sign the contract, she had already dropped out of school and practiced singing at home every day. She also hired private teachers at home to teach foreign languages in order to perform operas. Betty could have performed in opera long ago, because her mother thought that joining the opera area would only turn her into an opera star and there was no other hope, so she stopped her. Now this fifteen-year-old song queen is performing in famous dramas such as Carmen, Madame Butterfly, Martha, and Fansst.

Betty is a girl with golden, wavy hair, five feet and four inches tall, and a pair of large, blue eyes. In addition to her mother, there are three sisters and one brother in her family. Betty is now a famous rising star in opera, radio, and photography studios. She usually goes to bed early and gets up early, swims, rides horses, and plays tennis. On the screen, she admires Jeannette MacDonald the most. Recently, MacDonald gave Betty a letter, hoping that she would work hard, and said that she thought her singing was very beautiful. Betty cherishes these words very much. As for male stars, she admires Nelson Eddy the most.

### Shirley Temple Loves to Raise Rabbits

Is Shirley Temple a "genius"? No, she is just like other children and has a naughty personality. However, the talents of naughty children are probably smart. Shirley Temple's "intelligence" can be used by her environment and education, so she appears smarter than other children. If she did not have the help of a good education and a good environment, I am afraid that to this day, or until she died of old age, she might still be an unknown person, like other children whose intelligence has been buried. This, from the perspective of determinism, Shirley Temple is indeed a lucky person in this world.

Shirley Temple likes to raise rabbits very much. However, if you ask her "Why do you love rabbits?", she cannot answer. The reason is that she herself does not know the reason why she likes rabbits.

One day, when Shirley Temple was just learning to say "Dad" and "Mom", her mother took her to the zoo. In that zoo displaying strange beasts and birds, her eyes were attracted by a group of colorful rabbits. She jumped in her mother's arms in surprise and joy. Why didn't she show this kind of expression when she saw tigers, lions, jackals, leopards, and elephants? Her mother thought that her daughter was destined to be with rabbits.

Later, due to Shirley Temple's request, her mother bought her many rabbit toys. Leather, cloth, wood, and clay toys all became decorations in her room.

As she grew older, a movie director accidentally discovered her intelligence, and she climbed onto the screen and became popular. At this time, because her monthly income was so abundant, her mother arranged a paradise for her, catering to her preferences. All aspects of life, education, games, and career were prepared in detail, but her mother forgot to open a garden for her to raise rabbits. She never thought that the child really wanted to raise rabbits.

As a result, Shirley Temple proposed to buy real rabbits. The first time, she only bought five rabbits and built a small wooden shed in a small corner of the garden to provide them with sleeping quarters. So, Shirley Temple added another activity to her daily schedule. In the morning and evening, regardless of whether it was sunny or raining, she had to go and see her beloved rabbits. Three months later, one morning when she went to see the rabbits, there were none left. She cried. However, the fact was not so. Wild cats ate the rabbits because it was the breeding season, so they dug a burrow and hid in the underground layer to give birth to baby rabbits, so they did not come out at night.

After a few days, a large group of baby rabbits appeared in front of Shirley Temple. This is how they reproduce generation after generation. Now, there are hundreds of rabbits on her field, and the area of the rabbit garden has also been expanded to meet the needs. In the past, Shirley Temple went to feed the rabbits grass herself, but later she hired someone else to take care of the rabbits to replace her.

Now, raising rabbits is very developed in Shirley Temple's career. Society has given her the honorary title of "Rabbit Raising Expert".

Just looking at the point of raising rabbits, it can be proved that the environment and education used Shirley Temple's intelligence to make her a lucky person called a "genius".

### Jacques How's New Film Doesn't忌Taboo Thirteen

The most common superstition among Europeans and Americans is about the number thirteen, which is considered very unlucky. It is believed that whatever happens when it comes to "thirteen" is always an unlucky omen. There are many superstitious people in Hollywood. It is said that there is a star named Braceabelo who stays in bed for a day whenever the thirteenth and Friday fall on the same day and does nothing. There is also a director who always stops filming for a day when it comes to the thirteenth.

But recently, at the photography studio of the Oklahomakld film, they do not忌Tan "thirteen", but welcome "thirteen".

This is a western martial arts film by James Jacques Knight, who is returning to the big screen, and it is also his thirteenth work as a star since joining the film industry. The film began shooting on October 13th last year, and the scheduled shooting time was thirteen weeks. There must be thirteen exterior scenes in the film. That's not enough. The horse Knight rides is thirteen hands high, and there are thirteen knights with unique skills participating in the performance.

The door number on the door of Jacques Knight's mobile dressing room is number thirteen, and the car used to transport props to the exterior scene in the photography studio is exactly thirteen.

Director Liyyd Bacon was directing this film in the thirteenth anniversary of his joining the film industry as a director. Colleagues gave him a commemorative gold medal with a congratulatory message of thirteen words.

Lloyd Bacon, in response to the jokes made by his colleagues, came up with a way to retaliate. He invited thirteen important characters in the film, including Jacques Knight, Humphrey Bogart, Ruth Mary Rand, and Donald Crisp, to have a meal at 1:13 PM (ie 13 hours and 13 minutes) on November 13th. There were neither too many nor too few dishes, exactly thirteen.

Many thirteens, as a result, nothing unexpected happened, and the filming went smoothly and ended smoothly.

### Star-Harbor Chinese Football Heroes Gathering: South China and Jialingshan Welcome Visiting Team; Match Begins at 4 PM, Fans Please Arrive Early

[Our Report] Distinguished guests from Star-Harbor gracefully arrive, adding another chapter to the footballing history of this "recovering and prosperous" city.

"Honesty and no deception," if the visiting team isn't truly skilled, they'll surely "not pass the third bowl" (be easily defeated). This time they've come with strength and are not to be trifled with. South China takes the lead, and must be careful.

The strength of the Star-Harbor team is hard to estimate without seeing them play. However, they have a record of four wins and one loss in five matches in the Philippines. This indicates they must be strong. Also, this visiting team are the champions of Singapore's top-tier league for the past two years.

South China has already selected their players for this match. Each player possesses excellent skills, seemingly flawless. Only Yang Shuiyi's "mismatched arrangement" is a slight imperfection. I discussed this matter with Li Huitang, and he also disagrees with the arrangement. It would be better to still use Luo Douwen, rather than "going against the natural order."

Singaporean players are mostly agile, excelling in heading skills. This visiting team is no exception. Their triangular short-passing technique is their forte. South China players also possess this style. It may seem like they belong to the same school, but it's just that they've studied each other well and are generally similar.

South China has a "genuine" Li Huitang, while the Star-Harbor team has a "registered" new Li Huitang. It is heaven's will that they meet here, like a story from the Water Margin where Li Daotu meets the Black Whirlwind; the real and fake will be clearly distinguished.

The weather has been warm and pleasant for days, with beautiful scenery. The "old master" returns from the South Seas and will perform for the first time today. Football fans will certainly want to witness this. It is said that the one-dollar tickets have already sold out, and only a few of the one-dollar-fifty-cent tickets remain. South China authorities are worried about a massive crowd and insufficient facilities. Ticket sales for all grandstand seats will begin at 2:30 PM, on a first come first serve basis, with no additional tickets issued in order to maintain order. Fans are advised to arrive early.

It's difficult to predict the outcome of the initial outbreak. This is an important matter, as everyone wants to win. However, there are only three possible paths in war - victory, defeat, or a draw. The outcome will only be known after the match.

### Preparing to Compete for a Special Silver Plate: Police Club Arranges Match with Kwong Wah Today, Held at Boundary Street Field at 4 PM This Afternoon

Since the addition of Chinese players Chen Guangyu, Huang Wengui, Fan Guicai, and Jiang Xing to the Police First Division football team, their military strength has greatly improved. They have been rising steadily in the Special Silver Plate competition and have secured a place in the finals. If they win the finals against South China, the silver plate will be taken by the police force. The police team's members, having already secured the finals, know that reaching the mountain top is only ninety percent of the journey. If they don't work hard to overcome this final hurdle, all their efforts will be in vain. Therefore, the team practices shooting and endurance every morning, hoping to succeed. A friendly match against Kwong Wah Athletic Association's fourth division football team has been arranged for 4:30 PM this afternoon at the Boundary Street Field. To test their strength, the police team has asked Kwong Wah to play with full strength. Kwong Wah's talented players such as Hou Rongshan, Yang Zixiang, and Zhuo Shijin are all outstanding figures. Today's encounter will be a fierce competition.

### Yesterday's Tennis Match: The Xu Brothers Triumph Again; In Singles, Xiaolin Zhenying's Spirit Remains Strong

Last year's doubles champions, the Xu brothers, met Jiang Daozhang and Situ Bi yesterday, attracting a large audience. Old Jiang arrived early and sat in a corner, conserving his energy for the upcoming battle, displaying a spirited fighting spirit. At the start of the match, Old Jiang was indeed fierce, almost regaining his youthful vigor. His serves were powerful and his positioning was skillful. If Situ Bi had played more steadily, the Xu brothers would have had a hard time. In the first set, Jiang and Situ initially took a 3-1 lead. Suddenly, Xu Shi Huo was granted the serve, delivering powerful shots. Xu Shi Cong supported from the side, wielding his racket and narrowing the score to 2-3. From there, they soared ahead, surpassing their opponents 5-3. In the sixth game, Xu Shi Huo's serves were soft yet powerful, confusing Situ Bi, who missed many points. In the final move, Xu Shi Cong powerfully returned the ball, which Jiang and Situ failed to intercept, losing the set 4-6. In the second set, Old Jiang's ambition was like fire from the top of a volcano, charging straight to the heavens. Situ also put his mind to work, tearing through left and right. The Xu brothers, skilled in cooperation, unknowingly lost two games. At this point, the Xu brothers adopted a strategy of attacking as defense, blocking and counterattacking, leveling the score. The Jiang-Situ team became serious again, fighting hard and taking the lead again with 3-2. Wei Pei served and Run Pei went to the net, but Jiang-Situ's return failed, resulting in a tie. After that, the Xu brothers played better and better, their cooperative skills becoming more exquisite. Their high and low slices were dazzling. The final score was again 6-4. The match between Li Anna and Xiaolin Zhen undeniably belonged to Xiaolin. Moreover, Old Li's temper was somewhat impatient, unable to resist the calm and tenacious Xiaolin. The score was two sets of 6-2, Li lost.

### Grass Tennis Club Holds Annual Meeting; Lian Su Reelected as President for the Tenth Time; Vice President Wu Shigang to Leave Hong Kong; Luo Wenhui Elected to Replace Him

The Hong Kong Lawn Tennis Association held its annual general meeting at the Orchard Department Office last night (30th). Presided over by the association's president, Deputy Judge Lian Su, two new regulations were passed on the spot. The first was to replace the old Rule 4 of the Tennis Association rules. Part A stipulates that the association's affairs are handled by the Executive Committee, composed of the association's senior officers, namely the President, Vice President, Honorary Secretary, Honorary Treasurer, and four members. The second new Rule 7, called the League, stipulates that except for the lowest group (i.e., Group D), each team registering for each group must have four players. The deadline for registration is one week before the start of the competition (May 15th). During the season, the four registered players can only participate in the competition for the group they are registered in. They are not allowed to participate in competitions of lower-level groups. Following this, the 1939 officers were elected. Deputy Judge Lian Su was elected as the association's president for the tenth time. Luo Wenhui replaced Yang Shigang as vice president, as Wu is scheduled to leave Hong Kong next month. Pi Zhi Shi Dai Tate was re-elected as honorary secretary. He will be returning home for a long vacation. Ma Bola Han was re-elected as honorary treasurer. Bu Le Bu Lie Zhi was re-elected as secretary of the competition committee. Luo Dongdong, Xia Gaoli, Su Sha, and Colonel Bingtu were elected as members of the Executive Committee (Colonel Bingshi is the representative of the British Army and Air Force stationed in Hong Kong and will be returning home next week). Luo Wenhui, Jishi, Barrow, any of Colonel Bingshi's nominees, and Pi Yasi (also honorary secretary) were elected as members of the Inter-Port Representative Selection Committee. The deadline for registering for the 1939 League is April 15th. The competition will officially begin on May 15th, starting with the Group A teams. The dates for each group's competition each week have also been revised. Group A matches are scheduled for Mondays, Group B matches are scheduled for Tuesdays, Group C matches are scheduled for Wednesdays, Group D matches are scheduled for Thursdays, and mixed group matches are scheduled for Fridays.

### Stepping Further, Defeating Middlesex 3-1; Eastern Athletic Association's Hope for Second Place is Strong; Xian Hande Qi Repeatedly Achieved Special Merit; Su Shi Ge Ni Frequently Missed Good Opportunities

In the First Division Football League, the Eastern Athletic Association has shown courage since entering the second round-robin, making them a strong opponent for other teams. Yesterday was their final match, where they defeated Middlesex with a score of three to one. The Middlesex forwards are known for their charging skills, making yesterday's victory especially hard-earned. On the scoreboard, the Eastern Athletic Association has played a total of twenty games and scored 29 points. The Navy has played a total of nineteen games and also scored 29 points. However, the Navy still has one more game to play against South China. If South China wins, the Eastern Athletic Association and the Navy will have the same number of points. The decision on which team will be in second place will require a final match between the two teams.

The Shanghai players Cao Qiuting and Xu Wenku were originally scheduled to participate in the Eastern Athletic Association's match yesterday, but they were not seen on the field, disappointing many fans who wanted to admire their skills.

After the start of the match, the Eastern Athletic Association immediately adopted an offensive formation. The five forwards charged like tigers pouncing on sheep. However, Li Si's shot was ruled offside and the goal did not count. They were quickly countered, and the Middlesex five forwards heavily surrounded the Eastern Athletic Association's defense. Xu Zeng, Xu, and others tried hard to resist, with Xian Han repeatedly making saves, turning danger into safety. Then, Li Si led an attack. Bing Tu passed the ball, but it was headed out by Gu Ba. Shi Du Yuan passed the ball long, and Cheng Tao took the opportunity to break through. Ji Chen used his hand to block the ball. Li Si shot again, but Ji Chen desperately deflected it, relieving the danger. Soon after, Cheng Tao bravely seized the ball, dribbled past Fei Shi Wo Da, and passed it to the center, but no one responded. Shi Han kicked the ball away. Ge Ni got the ball and dribbled alone, with the Eastern Athletic Association's defenders unable to catch up. Xian Han guarded the dangerous city alone, helpless. However, Ge Ni was too hasty and shot the ball into Xian Han's feet, avoiding disaster. Mo Gao Zhi passed the ball, and Su Shi shot from the twelve-yard mark, but it was saved by Xian Han. After passing these two dangerous moments, the Eastern Athletic Association bravely advanced. Wu Qixiang, seeing a high ball flying in from thirty yards away, immediately shot hard without waiting for the ball to land. The shot was powerful and went straight into the net. Ji Chen could only shout in vain. Wu was credited with a remarkable feat. After the kickoff, Yu Qia Hing passed the ball to Li Si, who lived up to expectations, shooting from the right corner and scoring. This goal was less than a minute after the first goal. The Middlesex army collapsed, conceding two goals in a minute. They mustered their courage and counterattacked desperately. Xia Wu sneaked along the edge and passed it to Tai Tuo, who headed it out of bounds. Although they attacked repeatedly after that, they were blocked by the Eastern Athletic Association's defenders. The first half ended with a score of 2-0.

After the break, the Eastern Athletic Association was surrounded again. However, the Middlesex forwards repeatedly missed their shots. Xian Han also showed his skills, diving to save the ball several times. Soon after, Tai Tuo got an opportunity in front of the goal and shot hard, scoring and making the score 2-1. After the kickoff, the Middlesex attack became even more urgent. The Eastern Athletic Association's goal was in constant danger. Xu Jingcheng ran throughout the field, and the forwards also returned to defend. The Middlesex attack was ineffective and the players were exhausted. Cheng Tao took the opportunity to counterattack, passing the ball to Bing Tu, who passed Shi Han, and then passed it in, making the final score 3-1.

Up until yesterday afternoon, the Hong Kong stock market saw prices decline several times due to the European situation. As a result, buyers absorbed many high-interest stocks, leading to a considerable volume of transactions. However, the market was very quiet at the end of the week.

### Swinging at Empty Air

— Ling Mo

I once read this passage in a notebook. A man with a guilty conscience was walking across a muddy field. He constantly felt like a ghost was dragging at his legs, and it actually did drag him down. He got up covered in mud, and his eyes were also covered with mud; he couldn't see anything. He thought that he was surrounded by ghosts using a trick to obscure him, but he had always considered himself a courageous person, so he started swinging his fists at the ghosts in all directions. Accompanied by the flailing of his hands, his feet naturally moved quickly as well, and he no longer felt the pull of the mud. However, he never thought about running out of the mud. He wanted to hit so that no ghost dared to come near him, so he continued to attack in all directions, until his strength was exhausted, and he still died in the mud.

I don't remember it very completely; the original story probably actually had ghosts. Wherever this man's fists went, the ghosts avoided him, letting him hit empty air, and laughing at him. After he died, they laughed even harder. These details really have nothing to do with the main point of the story; the sadness of hitting empty air is always the same, and that is what makes what seems like heroism become comical. Biographers tell us that when Alexander the Great saw the vast expanse of empty land east of the Indus River, he cried loudly because there was no more world to conquer. This was not only because he was finally facing emptiness, but also because he realized that even his past conquests were aimed at emptiness. Alexander did not wait until he was exhausted from swinging at emptiness before he died, but perhaps that shows that he was even more unfortunate. We can easily imagine that the person trapped in the mud, if he did not continue swinging until death, would have died from another kind of mental breakdown.

American famous journalist Gunther, in "Inside Europe", describes a dictator as a neurotic, which can also help us understand the above story. It is said that during the European war, he suddenly broke out with a neurotic episode because he broke into a silent position, so he fired randomly and muttered loudly, which actually scared the ambushers in the other side's position into coming out and surrendering their weapons, allowing him to capture them back. The strange result is naturally different from the story above, but the situation is completely similar. So, what if the miracle does not appear? Wouldn't his last bullet be applied in the same way as King Jones's last bullet? This seems to require no further speculation. King Jones is a script, and the author had to arrange his last bullet for him. In the case of having enough bullets, it would definitely not end well, and even if he was determined to make that shot the last shot, he couldn't do it.

Facts cannot be replayed like a script, we cannot put him in the same scene to see another result. However, the other scenes played by the same character will not be later than the original style, we still see his posture of swinging at emptiness. It is true that we cannot ignore the actual victims under the attack, but from the perspective of the attacker, it is ultimately just unnecessary swinging at emptiness. He himself did not want to be able to make the final blow, but even if he stopped, he would collapse, so he continued to swing.

### In Memory of Karel Čapek

— Written by T. Lukov, Translated by Chen Shih-huai

The premature death of K. Čapek has deprived the Czech people and world literature of an outstanding writer of our time.

Čapek's name was recently put forward for the Nobel Prize for Literature, a proposal supported by another international writers' organization – PEN International. All progressive writers around the world, who understand the extreme threat that fascism poses to culture and democratic politics, agreed that Čapek deserved this award.

In his more than twenty years of literary work, Čapek wrote many novels, short stories, and plays. He was the author of many works dealing with the reality of modern life, but often used fantasy or utopian forms to express the satire that brought him world fame. Čapek made his debut as a writer who constantly exposed the dark side of capitalist society, with the play R.U.R. (1921), which depicted the rebellion of the thugs against the capitalists who created them. He exposed and harshly criticized the decline of modern life under capitalism, tolerating its decline under industrial progress.

After the Hitler party seized power in Germany, Čapek understood that fascism was the most dangerous enemy of his humanitarian consciousness. He first began to oppose the cannibals of the twentieth century in an allegorical novel, "The War with the Newts," and soon in his play "The White Disease" (1936), he openly branded fascism as the main enemy of humanity. Because of this behavior, he himself suffered the cruel hatred of the Hitler party. As Czech left-wing critics said, the fascists hated Čapek more than any other Czech writer.

Čapek's last play, "Mother," deserves special attention for its skillful writing and Čapek's anti-fascist attitude. In his previous works, the expectation of an immediate struggle with fascism was pessimistic, and he did not call on the people to resist the invaders. In "Mother," Čapek portrayed a memorable image of a woman who lost her husband and four sons, agitated by terror, shocked by the interference of the intruders into her country. She is still sending her remaining son to the front line to defend the freedom of their motherland. Čapek pointed out the people's excited enthusiasm, armed, and ready to block the path of the X people in every way as soon as the order is given.

"Mother" was a great success in the performance in Prague, and the play is now being performed in Paris. Undoubtedly, he has done a great task and will do an even greater task in mobilizing the masses against the Fascist invaders.

Before the Munich secret, Čapek led a large-scale anti-fascist movement. He led all Czech writers to appeal to democratic countries, and he signed the well-known Czech writers' appeal; "To the Conscience of Mankind". Undoubtedly, he deeply felt the tragedy of his country, his people, loyal to the democratic countries of Western Europe. And in what he wrote, we see the result of the internal conflict that Čapek felt when fascism split his motherland.

The deceased writer was a great humanitarian who deeply loved culture and science. He firmly stood on his anti-fascist position and believed in the final victory of the people and democracy. He did not live to see the day he dreamed of, but that day is not far away. The free Czech people will lovingly discuss his cultural issues and gratefully remember his famous writer – he saw the danger threatening his motherland and dedicated his life's last vitality to fighting that threat.

Guerrilla Hong Feng Engraving

### Prosperous Guangzhou?

— Ji Zi

I remember Lu Xun said something like this: "Guangdong, the source of the revolution, is also the source of reaction." (The general idea is like this) This statement has been confirmed in "Prosperous Guangzhou". A kind of homecoming wave is spreading in the sea of people in Hong Kong, forming a powerful undercurrent. The call to go to Guangzhou has already been shouted out in the hearts of some people. This group of people contains those who are fueling the flames, the poor who have no place to stand, and independent professionals such as doctors. Everyone has their own reasons: the greatest task of the traitors is to collude with the X people and transport their compatriots into hell, which is exactly the way to cooperate; the displaced and struggling masses have no choice but to imagine that Guangzhou has entered a state of tranquility, hoping that there may be a place to find food; as for the independent professionals, these people whose petty bourgeois inferiority is exposed at any time, they are making wishful thinking,妄想 building a new nest on the scorched earth, and doing that shameless business on the ruins——monopolizing medicine, thinking that the opportunity to make a fortune has come, is it really something that can be cultivated for several lifetimes?

Naturally, the X people have repeatedly lured citizens to return to the province to register their houses, and sent ships to Hong Kong, requiring only simple procedures and cheap tickets to safely go to Guangzhou. Undoubtedly, all are cunning means. The ultimate goal is still to form a climax of the hometown movement, so that the dead city that has suffered the devastation can restore prosperity and create a Tokyo-style Guangzhou. This is the trick of the X people, which is not surprising, but it is a tragic miracle that intellectuals insist on going to the fire bravely and are afraid of being too late! The taste of being an English submissive is not good at all. Seeing the imperial army, you have to bow like a servant, be submissive, and if you get slapped, you have to smile to compensate. What you get from operating is just a few military tickets, picking up a little leftovers from others, picking up other people's saliva, and the power of life and death is in the hands of irrational people. Do you feel more refreshed spiritually? Or is material enjoyment more comfortable? It's really confusing. For people who have special tasks, such as guerrillas and their supporters, I agree in principle that they should return to their hometown, but I oppose going unconditionally to be submissive and to help the evildoers!

The most correct path, of course, is to go into the guerrilla area, go to the front line, or go to work in the rear. This must be decided according to each person's environment and interests. The meaning is, of course, not the same.

### Review of "Wartime Japan" Issue 6

— Wen Yu

"Wartime Japan" Issue 6, as suggested by the editors, focuses on "Analyzing Japan's Isolated Situation in the New Stage of the Sino-Japanese War" and "Sketching the Problems of Japanese Women on the Occasion of the March 8th Women's Day."

Under the topic of "Analyzing Japan's Isolated Situation," Mr. Chunzhen's article "Japan's International Environment in the New Stage" best grasps the reality in a comprehensive way. He treats Japan not only as "Japan in the Far East," but also as "Japan in the World." He extracts a few of the most prominent essential rough lines from the complex and diverse international stage film, and then runs these lines through Japan and even the entire international situation.

He grasps "the fate of Japanese imperialism is in China" and "Japan cannot control the overall situation in the world" as basic understandings. Then he gradually analyzes in detail, pointing out that "the international center is in Europe," "the fuse for the outbreak of war is likely to be in Central and Southern Europe," and explaining that "the Sino-Japanese War," "the Italian-Ethiopian War," "the Sudetenland Question," and even the Spanish Civil War could not be direct fuses for the war. He further points out that "a great war cannot be without an important anti-Soviet component."

How is the European problem related to the Far East? The author points out two points: "First, the Pacific War must follow the European War," and "Second, the decision on the Pacific situation is not in the hands of Britain and France, but in the hands of the United States and the Soviet Union," because "Britain and France cannot use the Far East problem to determine the final plan of the country," while the United States and the Soviet Union are the opposite. However, this also gives Japan an opportunity to take advantage of. It "first starts from the weakness" and then constantly threatens Britain and France, and echoes with Germany and Italy. This kind of intricate international relationship is the root cause of the chaos and complexity of the Pacific situation.

Starting from the point that "a great war cannot be without an anti-Soviet nature," the author judges that Japan's attack on the Soviet Union is a "major strategy," foreshadowing the picture of the Pacific War. His conclusion is that Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union must stand on the same front, and the Soviet Union must "participate in the war as a socialist country." Among them, it is particularly pointed out that "China is the main force in overthrowing Japanese imperialism," and "the completion of overthrowing Japanese imperialism must not lack the combination of China and the Soviet Union."

Finally, the author expounds on the anti-aggression toughness of the United States and the Soviet Union, and concludes that "the peace front has sprouted a counter-offensive to the fascist countries." And Japan in this new stage is completely isolated in the Pacific, so it cannot but "strengthen the combination of Germany and Italy" and "increasingly take the step of dominating East Asia," and "the ending must be" from isolation to agitating public outrage," which proves Japan's diplomatic dead end.

Mr. Liu Yaosang's article "On the Economic Sanctions Against Japan by Britain, the United States, and France" is based on Japan's international isolation and the strengthening of the anti-Japanese front of Britain and the United States, and discusses the issue of sanctions against Japan. He pointed out that whether it is the passive "stopping the import of Japanese goods" or the active "stopping all economic exchanges with Japan," the sanctions method can be effective. Furthermore, from the analysis of the specific situations of the four countries, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, it shows that the Far East policies of various countries are becoming more active and have the determination to implement sanctions against Japan. It opposes the general misunderstanding that "sanctions mean war," believing that the problem is determined by "whether the sanctions are effective and whether the countries participating in the sanctions have the determination to implement their policies," and negates the 悮"sanctions mean war."

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

"I failed!"

"No: You're not allowed to say that again..."

"I'm telling you, I'm injured!"

"You're injured?"

"Really."

"Then how can you still talk?"

"I'm not dead yet."

"No, I wanted to stab you in the throat."

"Throat? Just a little bit off."

This is comfort, but also irony. He guides her finger to touch the bloodstain on his neck; she doesn't seem to believe it, she asks:

"Then why don't you retaliate? Why don't you shoot?"

"Because you are not my personal target for gun testing, but the capital of our comrades' common cause!"

This casual indulgence expresses a pure confession from his heart. This confession makes her believe that her life is powerfully guaranteed. Therefore, she begins to regret – that she shouldn't have been cowardly, nor should she have succumbed to the stranger's intimidation, and even more shouldn't have been deceived by him and traveled with him; the weak often regret, and when they regret, it is often endless. Therefore, she hurried a few steps, then found a dark corner of the wall, and stopped; the weak, except for worrying about their own lives, are often fearless, as brave as the strong. He also stopped with her, but he avoided her, about two steps away. He feels the picked-up sharp knife. Still in his pocket, he jokingly asks her:

"Do you still have a sharp knife?"

She doesn't answer.

"But if there is a sharp knife, there is no scarf anymore, let's go!"

She doesn't go.

When he urges her to go seriously, she says seriously:

"I'm not going!"
