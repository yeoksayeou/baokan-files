### The Black Market Exchange Rate Under Exchange Equalization

— Zhang Liu

Mr. Zhang Liu is a pen name of a certain economist, and he is respected for his familiarity with the financial market. This article is a powerful prediction of the future of the black market for foreign exchange. Those concerned about this issue should pay attention. — Editor

1.  The Exchange Equalization Fund and the Black Market

The Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has been established in Hong Kong. The so-called equalization fund is of course to equalize the exchange rate of the legal tender. However, there are actually two exchange rates in China now: one is the official rate quoted by the Central Bank, and the other is the private rate in the black market. Then, what exchange rate will the Exchange Equalization Fund implement in the future? The official rate or the private rate?

Based on the following reasons, we assume that the exchange rate to be equalized in the future will be the private rate, not the official rate, because:

First, the exchange rate of the Central Bank has been extremely stable so far, with no changes to the original rate, so there is no need for equalization at all. Moreover, since the currency reform, the government has had special funds for the equalization fund in London and New York. After the emergence of the black market, the Bank of China also came out to adjust it (see Mr. Song Ziwen's remarks). Comparing the black market exchange rate at that time with the later exchange rate, it can be seen that China's foreign exchange equalization fund has been profitable without loss. In other words, China's foreign exchange fund may not have increased after the war, but it will definitely not suffer losses. In this way, there is no need to replenish the foreign exchange fund. The fund set up this time is naturally for equalizing the black market.

Second, this is based on the existence of the black market exchange rate. Because if the black market does not exist, then there is only one exchange rate, so naturally there is no need to ask which one to equalize. In reality, if British and American banks are determined and willing to help China's national banks to eliminate the black market, it seems not impossible. However, in the current market situation, since they can easily obtain Chinese goods worth one yuan for eight pence, why must they be foolish enough to exchange them at the official rate of one shilling and two and a half pence?

Third, when the foreign exchange fund was established, the London side issued a statement, believing that it was beneficial to British commerce. And the current trade of various countries is almost concentrated in the black market, so the so-called benefit naturally also refers to the black market. Judging from the position of the committee banks: HSBC and Jardine Matheson are commercial banks. Although the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are both known as national banks like the Central Bank, they also occupy an important position in commercial banks. If it is to equalize the official rate, then there should be the Central Bank included. Again, judging from the location of its establishment, if it is China's foreign exchange agency, the headquarters should be set up in Chongqing, and Hong Kong should be an office. However, the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee was clearly originated in London and places its focus on Hong Kong, so its equalization goal must also be to stabilize the black market and facilitate Sino-British trade, no doubt.

2.  Nine Pence? Or Eight Pence?

Since there has been a black market for foreign exchange, the market price has generally been declining, from the initial one shilling and two and a half pence to about eight pence and twenty-five recently. However, there is a special feature in between, that is, in the past three months, the market price has been particularly stable. The trend of its stability, observed from experience: (1) When there is a large amount of release, Jardine Matheson and HSBC are often the absorbers; (2) When the position is very tight, Jardine Matheson and HSBC are often the suppliers; (3) After the market price extends beyond eight pence and twenty-five, it will soon return to eight pence and twenty-five; and if the market price shrinks below eight pence and twenty-five, it will soon be balanced above eight pence and twenty-five. From points (1) and (2), it is clear that HSBC and Jardine Matheson are actually undertaking the work of equalizing the exchange market. From point (3), it is clear that the standard in the foreign exchange black market has been stabilized above eight pence and twenty-five.

After the news of the Foreign Exchange Fund came out, I realized that Jardine Matheson and HSBC were originally responsible members of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee. Then, what will be the future standard of balance in the black market?

(1) It is said that it will be raised to nine pence. The reason is that the exchange rate of eight and a half pence or eight pence and twenty-five is too far from the statutory official rate. Shanghai foreign firms and import and export firms are rumored to have requested to be given foreign exchange at nine pence. The level of eight pence and twenty-five has been stable for several months. If it is allowed to be released for a long time, it will immediately give the financial market a contraction effect. Therefore, starting from the current rate, it is most likely to raise the exchange rate to nine pence.

(2) There is also a saying that the exchange market will not move and will always be stable above the current price of eight pence and twenty-five. The reason is that the current price has been stable for several months, and the stimulus caused by the depreciation of the exchange rate has given Shanghai the benefit of raising prices, resulting in a special boom. If various countries want to support trade, they must maintain this boom, which is to maintain the level of low exchange rates.

(3) There is also a saying that the foreign exchange black market will have no level of ups and downs in the future. The task of the Foreign Exchange Committee is to stabilize the foreign exchange black market, but not to supply the foreign exchange black market. Therefore, the Foreign Exchange Committee will not care about whether British merchants can obtain foreign exchange at the market price of nine pence in the future, and will ignore other merchants. At the same time, the method of "absorbing as much as possible when there is a large position, and throwing out to a certain extent when there is a small position" is still used to stabilize the exchange market for foreign exchange trading in the black market.

The above three statements have some reasons and some possibilities. It is not yet clear from the recent market situation what method the authorities will adopt. However, a few points can be determined in advance: First, it is generally impossible for the foreign exchange black market to shrink further. Second, the Foreign Exchange Fund Committee will directly participate in the foreign exchange black market. Or use a certain standard, but not necessarily maintain a certain standard.

3.  The Future of the Black Market and the Official Rate

Some people have long advocated lowering the official rate, in other words, abolishing the official rate and complying with the black market. This proposal has not been realized and has never been realized. If it is realized, it will be harmful and not beneficial to China. If the official rate is abolished, it is tantamount to stating that the government has no sincerity in maintaining the original exchange rate. At the same time, the informal exchange rate in the black market is given legal recognition by abolishing the official rate, so it has never been implemented in fact.

Finally, in terms of the essence of the foreign exchange equalization fund, there are very few advantages to maintaining the black market price through foreign exchange equalization. Because the occurrence of the foreign exchange black market is due to China's management of foreign exchange. If the black market can be given whatever it wants, then why manage foreign exchange during the war?

But on the other hand, it is ultimately beneficial to China. The increase in the foreign exchange equalization fund indicates that China's monetary base is becoming more and more consolidated; at the same time, since the committee is handled by Chinese and British experts, it will certainly not be used by third countries.

### World Trends in a Week

— Pan Lang

From April 9th to April 15th

1939 is a year of storms, and April 1939 is even more a month of storms, with gales, showers, thunder, lightning, plus unprecedented darkness and stench.

Albania has been annexed again, sacrificed to Italy's crazy aggression and the non-interventionist policies of Britain and France! After the fall of Albania, the Balkan countries are naturally in a precarious situation, and all of Europe and even Latin America can no longer fantasize about peace without resistance. However, are the anti-aggression steps taken by Britain, France, and the United States sufficient to stop the escalating world crisis?

The Eastern aggressors, at a time when the European situation is critical, are rushing to convene a meeting of senior officials, on the one hand, to intensify their steps to attack China, and on the other hand, to implement their old trick of "taking advantage of the fire" against Britain and France! China's resistance war has had more significant developments this week, but what countermeasures will Britain and France take against the Far East crisis?

(1) The Fall of Albania Makes the World Crisis More Urgent

Albania, under the large-scale attack of Italy, finally fell due to being outnumbered. Italian troops landed on the 7th, entered the Albanian capital Tirana on the 8th, and started to organize a puppet regime on the 9th. So far, Europe has lost another independent small country, and the aggressors have completed part of the plan to transform the world map.

Albania, with its small country and small population, and its extremely poor military strength, was still able to resolutely resist the large-scale offensive of the powerful enemy's naval and air forces. It repeatedly repelled the enemy troops in places such as the Port of Razzo, and Albanian hunters and people from all walks of life also actively participated in the war of resistance. The two Albanian princes are still leading the armed anti-aggression struggle. This kind of national spirit can guarantee the possibility of its future restoration. We should give it unlimited sympathy and blessings.

After the fall of Albania, Yugoslavia and Greece were directly threatened, and the entire Balkans was also shaken. Moreover, the collusion of the Italian and German aggressors has further increased the threat to Poland, Romania, and even the entire Europe. Conversely, on the aggressor's side, after Italy occupied Albania, it can completely monopolize the Adriatic Sea at sea, blocking Yugoslavia's maritime communication with Britain and France, and enhancing its position in the Eastern Mediterranean; on land, it has obtained a base for invading the Balkan countries, and cooperate with Germany's future military operations in Southeast Europe. German and Italian forces are increasing in Spain, and they already have the potential to dominate the Western Mediterranean; now that Italy has occupied Albania, it can complete the plan of Germany and Italy to establish an advantage in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Germany and Italy's second step has already begun! On the 9th, the Moscow News' Rome reporter reported: Italian troops will soon occupy the southern border and coast to launch a wider offensive against British and French territories. On the 10th, the London Times' Rome correspondent reported: Germany and Italy attempted to seize the Aegean Sea and further force Romania to cede Black Sea ports. On the 13th, the Paris Evening News and the London Daily Evening News also reported: Italy is preparing to secretly agree with Yugoslavia to divide the Balkans and plan to organize an independent state of Macedonia. American politicians further pointed out: Germany and Italy's goal is not only to include the Balkans, but also to continue to hold meetings after the anti-aggression group has enriched its ranks to test whether Britain and France have the determination to resist. Berlin has also revealed further German and Italian aggression plans: to control all small countries and divide Central Europe equally, such as forcing Poland to join the Axis and Romania and Hungary to be controlled by Germany. Due to internal crises, Germany and Italy urgently took military speculative risks, taking the invasion of small countries as the first step in attacking Britain and France. In reality, the world war has reached a more serious stage.

(2) Small Countries Panic and Flounder, Britain and France Issue Declarations Again

Since the fascist aggressors' crazy adventure to advance the world war is as described above, what are the expressions of democratic and peaceful countries?

First, all the small countries that have become direct annexation targets, although there are currently signs of "panic and fluttering," most of them are unwilling to surrender in humiliation and are preparing to unite and resist. Greece, Yugoslavia, Switzerland, the Netherlands, etc. have all implemented partial mobilization in preparation for emergencies. The anti-aggression sentiment of Near Eastern Islamic countries and Muslims around the world is extremely high. In Turkey, Syria, Palestine, and even North Africa, there have been enthusiastic anti-Italian demonstrations in the past week. Romania and Turkey ended talks on the 10th and have agreed to work together to maintain the safety and independence of the two countries. There will also be important talks between Romania and Southern countries in the coming days. However, if Britain and France do not actively unite these small countries, establish a collective security policy, and resolutely resist aggression, then all small countries will inevitably be defeated individually, and then Britain and France themselves will be affected!

Second, Britain and France have also been forced to take various steps to resist aggression. British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier simultaneously issued declarations on the 13th, stating the positions of the two countries on the current European situation. The main points of Chamberlain's declaration are: (1) The British Empire is determined to use its utmost efforts to prevent anything that attempts to disrupt the status quo in the Mediterranean or the Balkan Peninsula through threats or force; (2) Guarantee the independence of Greece and Romania; (3) Do not issue the Anglo-Italian Agreement; (4) Still have contact with Soviet Russia; (5) Call on peaceful countries to unite and resist aggression. Daladier's declaration is roughly the same, and the main points are: (1) The French government has taken military measures to defend its territory; (2) Maintain contact with Wu Meisu Bo Tu Luonan Greece and other countries to maintain peace; (3) Guarantee the integrity of Romania and Greece; (4) France and Poland implement mutual assistance based on the alliance treaty. This kind of declaration by Britain and France has extremely important significance, especially the courage to openly declare the determination to unite with the Soviet Union and other peaceful countries to resist the aggressors. However, in order to truly exert the effect of stopping aggression, it still depends on truly implementing a collective security policy, effectively uniting the Soviet Union and the United States, uniting all small countries, sanctioning aggressive countries, and striving for a long-term overall peace. Members of the British Parliament have unanimously demanded that Britain and the Soviet Union cooperate effectively, and the French people are also demanding the same enthusiastically.

(3) Close Cooperation Between the United States and the Soviet Union Strengthens the Peace Front

The anti-aggression movements of the United States and the Soviet Union have recently made new progress. US President Roosevelt published an important speech in the "Washington Post" on the 11th, warning aggressive countries, he said: "If totalitarian countries truly cause war, at the beginning of their actions, there will be a country that is more powerful than the combined forces of Germany and Italy, which will be involved." American newspapers also unanimously pointed out that Luo's article means: "If a great war breaks out, the United States cannot turn a blind eye." American officials also unanimously supported it, believing that "it correctly shows the attitude of the American government and people towards the situation." On the 14th, US Secretary of State Hull broadcast to the world, emphasizing that the entire American nation has the determination and courage to resist aggressive countries. And recently, the movement of government officials and people to aid China and curb Japan is even more enthusiastic. Democratic Congressman Fuchs and former Republican Speaker of the House Tilson have made important suggestions and have gained support.

As for the friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union and between the Soviet Union and China, there has recently been significant progress. The Soviet naval investigation team has arrived in Washington to conduct important talks on naval cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. The US Department of Commerce also used trade figures with the Soviet Union to prove the Soviet Union's industrial density and the strengthening of its national defense industry. At the same time, American diplomatic observers also unanimously pointed out: The Soviet Union's Far East policy will definitely be strengthened, and aid to China will also be intensified. The reasons are: (1) The Soviet Union has now completed the work of purging the party and the army, and there is no need to worry about internal affairs during wartime; (2) The efficiency of the Soviet Union's national defense procedures has exceeded general expectations; (3) Soviet strategists firmly believe that defending both eastern and western borders at the same time can be successful. In addition, the Associated Press Washington telegram on the 12th also reported the recent remarks of a Soviet spokesperson, saying: "The Soviet Union must and has been preparing for self-defense in both Europe and Asia at the same time; because the Axis countries are full of tricks and will inevitably echo each other east and west."

The determination, courage, and strength of the United States and the Soviet Union to resolutely resist the aggressors, and the progress in the friendly relations between the United States, the Soviet Union, and China will definitely increase the fighting spirit of peace and justice-loving people all over the world. Even Britain and France, for the Soviet Union, have been forced by the situation to attach importance to its power to protect peace, and are constantly conducting negotiations on various relationship issues. People of insight in Britain and France are also urging the government to unite with the Soviet Union and expand the peace front: Liberal Party leader Lloyd George gave a speech on the 12th, urging Chamberlain to quickly establish effective military cooperation with the Soviet Union; British Labour Party leader Attlee, Conservative Party leader Churchill, Liberal Party leader Sinclair, Labour MP Dalton, and even the Duke of Sutherland and the Marquis of Zetland, also urged the government in both houses of Parliament to conclude an alliance with the Soviet Union as a guarantee for establishing an anti-aggression group.

As for the Far East, when the Governor of Singapore traveled to Annam and Siam in February, he suggested that Malaya, Singapore, Annam, Burma, and Siam should jointly sign a non-aggression pact to break Japan's instigation. Recently, it has been widely rumored that it has received "good reactions." We hope that Britain, France, and the United States will recognize the serious threat to all countries posed by Japan's invasion of China and the recent seizure of Hainan Island and the Xinnan Islands, and quickly unite with China and the Soviet Union, unite all small countries and oppressed nations, and jointly resist the aggressors, just as everyone in Europe is demanding.

(4) Full-Scale Counter-Offensive Launched, Optimistic Situation in the War of Resistance

The competition between the two fronts of democratic and peaceful countries and fascist aggressors in the international arena has been fiercely launched. Our anti-Japanese war of justice to defend national independence and freedom and defend world peace has also had a more violent development.

First, look at the war situation. As the New York Min Sheng Pao's editorial on the 11th said, based on the observations of military strategists, "The Japanese army's difficulties are increasing, and the Chinese army's counter-offensive is gaining momentum, so the Japanese army's adventurous actions against China will reach an emergency." Since the fall of Wuhan, the Japanese army's difficulties in insufficient and dispersed troops have become increasingly prominent. Until the fall of Nanchang, the consumption of combat power was particularly significant. In addition, military difficulties and the need for a large number of troops in the country, Taiwan, Korea, and Northeast China made it difficult to replenish new troops. Although they have recently tried to carry out speculative adventures, their actual strength is extremely limited. Therefore, the current Japanese military strategy is: (1) to intensify the strengthening of the occupied areas; (2) to closely coordinate the "peace" and "anti-communist" movements; (3) to use the anti-communist and peace smoke screen to carry out military speculative adventures. As for the current strategy, it is (1) to intensify the opening of the Pinghan and Yuehan lines and strengthen the occupation of eastern China; (2) to implement military speculation in the northwest and southwest, and if the anti-communist and peace conspiracies make progress, they will immediately invade on a large scale.

In order to crush the Japanese's new strategy, we must thoroughly strike at the political conspiracies of Japanese traitors who oppose communism and seek peace. On the other hand, we must intensify the enhancement of the combat power of the front lines and widely launch guerrilla warfare behind the enemy.

In terms of military development, we have launched a full-scale general counter-offensive this week, from the Sui-Cha front in the north to the coast of the South China Sea in the south. What is most worthy of attention is: (1) In North China, it is reported that Fu Zuoyi's troops have entered Sui-Xi, and the military and political situation in Sui Province has suddenly become active; two divisions of pseudo-Mongolian cavalry have revolted one after another, and the military and civilians in the village are enthusiastically resisting the war. The Japanese army in Shanxi invaded Zhongtiao Mountain seven times, but all seven times were defeated. Ruicheng and Monan have now been recovered, and all important strongholds are in our hands. Our army in western and northwestern Shanxi has also launched counter-offensives one after another, which have been very successful. Guerrilla warfare in various parts of Ji-Lu is also continuing. (2) In Northeast China, the Eighth Route Army troops have penetrated into Guanwai and established contact with the anti-Japanese united forces in various places; recently, there has been a lot of rumors at Jinzhou and HuangguTung stations on the BeiNing Road. The four northeastern provinces have now been assigned to the ×th war zone, and ×× has been appointed as the commander. The guerrilla teams in the Jin-Yi-Sui area have been ordered to go out of Guan and launch a large-scale counter-offensive. (3) On the Longhai Line, the Eighth Route Army and the troops of Yu Xuezhong, Sun Dianying, and Sun Tongxuan are attacking Xuzhou and Kaifeng from both east and west. Kaifeng was immediately stormed by us on the 11th, and street fighting was still going on on the 12th and 13th; six members of the pseudo-Jing-Sui Committee were killed, and the Japanese and puppet troops suffered heavy losses. Foreign military observers also believe that "the Chinese army's first effective attack on the Japanese army's occupation of important cities." At the same time, a part of the Eighth Route Army, about 2,000 people, won a great victory northeast of Taierzhuang on the 12th. The counter-offensive against Xuzhou and the military in the Lu-Yu-Su border area is about to have new developments. (4) The counter-offensive military in Hubei and Henan provinces has also had considerable success this week. The Japanese army in the Zhongxiang area is being encircled and annihilated, and the Japanese army in Xinyang and other places has also been besieged by our army, suffering heavy losses. (5) On the battlefields inside the country, our army in northern Jiangsu took advantage of the victory to advance to Muyang and surround Huaiyin. Our army in Anhui attacked the Hefei area, and the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. More than 1,000 troops from the puppet army under Lu Jiayun revolted in full on the 9th. Our army in the border areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi has also launched a large-scale counter-offensive in separate routes. And the suburbs of Nanjing have also been attacked again by our New Fourth Army. (6) In South China, a part of our army has captured Foshan, another part has captured Huaxian, and another part has captured Zengcheng in the east, and is now coordinating to advance on Guangzhou.

Due to the development of counter-offensives on various battlefields, the overall war situation has dramatically shifted to an advantageous position. Coupled with the political fact that the national generals, the national people, and the government authorities severely punished the traitor Wang Jingwei, and thoroughly cracked down on the "anti-communist peace" conspiracy, the future of our war of resistance and nation-building is brighter and more optimistic! However, at present, whether politically, militarily, or diplomatically, all our achievements have not reached the point where we can fatally strike the Japanese; the crisis within the Japanese, the crisis within the Japanese army, and the difficulties faced by all Japanese activities abroad have not developed to the point where they are unable to launch adventurous offensives, and the traitors and collaborators are intensifying their anti-communist peace conspiracy to serve the Japanese and harm our country and nation! Therefore, we must intensify the internal unity, the progress in military and politics, the enhancement of national self-esteem and self-confidence, and realize the general mobilization of all the strength of the national people, cooperate with the development of the international anti-aggression peace front, and thoroughly strike the Japanese traitors. Only in more arduous battles can we have our victorious peace!

### The New Fourth Army's Year of Anti-Japanese War: Experiences and Lessons (II)

— Xiang Ying

Based on a year of combat, the strengths and weaknesses of the Japanese can be divided into the following points: First, the Japanese tactics: 1. The Japanese tactics rely on constructing strongholds everywhere, building roads, and narrowing the scope of our activities. 2. Simultaneous advance and combined attacks, adopting surprise encirclements. 3. Lightly equipped advancement, facilitating rapid movement and surprise attacks. 4. Employing ambushes, using roads to ambush our troops. 5. Adopting concealed actions, easily detected during the day, acting at night, causing our vigilance to be lax, and troops easily attacked. They take small roads, not main roads. 6. Relying on firepower, using firepower to threaten the Japanese, suppressing the Japanese. Second, the Japanese advantages: 1. Accurate shooting. 2. Skilled in using terrain and objects for concealment and advancement. 3. Able to swim. 4. Rapid rescue of wounded and sick soldiers, quick collection of military supplies. 5. Tenacity due to the education of Bushido, the arbitrariness of warlords, deception, and propaganda, forming the tenacity of the Japanese army in combat. In the past, they would rather die than surrender, but now the degree has decreased, not as tenacious as before. 6. Various movements are in line with tactics, meeting the requirements of combat. 7. The officers are very strong, able to control the troops, and deploy quickly in combat. 8. The soldiers are highly obedient, advancing when told to advance, retreating when told to retreat, and able to regroup after being defeated. 9. Very strong ability to repair transportation. 10. Tactical application is very flexible, changing at any time. If they fail today, they will change tomorrow. Third, strategies to deal with us: 1. All important transportation lines, as well as the turning points of highways, are built with fortifications as strongholds. 2. Making barbed wire, using police dogs, and using mobile bridges for small rivers. 4. When marching or transporting, use small forces to occupy prominent positions first, concealing the advance, searching forward. 5. Camping locations are often changed. 6. Houses are dug with trenches and gun holes. 7. Use waterways for transportation to prevent our attacks. Fourth, the enemy's weaknesses: 1. Contempt for the enemy still exists, and vigilance is lax. 2. Lack of offensive spirit. 3. Awkward and slow movements. 3. Cannot endure labor, cannot march long distances. Forced marches, rapid marches. 5. Taking advantage of the failures of Chinese traitors and the uselessness and unreliability of puppet troops.

Experiences and Lessons of Civil Affairs Work

In the past year, both in the front and in the rear, in order to mobilize the masses and strengthen the strength of the anti-Japanese war, and to achieve cooperation between the military and the people, and with the support and help of the masses, we have been able to persist in the struggle in the difficult environment of Jiangnan. Therefore, since the establishment of our army, we have carried out mass movements anytime and anywhere. Although we, due to various objective conditions, at a certain time, in a certain stage, could not carry out mass work according to our own wishes, or even could not do mass work, for example, at the beginning of the establishment of our army, from reorganization to concentration, especially in the stage of concentration, we, in order to abide by the orders of our superiors, in order to avoid many misunderstandings, during this time, how could we say that we did not do mass work, until after our troops were deployed, and during combat, only in our own combat area, around our own troops, did we begin to carry out mass work. Our previous propaganda work was very little, and only at this time did we begin to carry it out, not only propaganda, but also from propaganda to organization, but even to this day, there are still some people who do not understand the importance of mass work, and do not understand how to achieve military-civilian cooperation. This not only fails to develop mass movements on the surface, to achieve the development of the national salvation movement, but even unwilling to have mass movements, and are jealous of others doing mass movements. Why do we do civil affairs work? For the sake of the anti-Japanese war, in order to defeat the Japanese, eliminate the Japanese, and win the victory of the anti-Japanese war. From the perspective of the army itself, for the survival of the army, without the masses, the army cannot develop, cannot grow, and will be defeated. Especially under the comparative conditions of the Sino-Japanese War, our weapons are much worse than the Japanese. Taking our New Fourth Army as an example, it is even worse than the weapons of ordinary anti-Japanese armies. We use such inferior weapons to fight against the superior Japanese, mainly relying on the strength and help of the masses. If there are no masses, then not only will we not be able to resist the Japanese, but we will not be able to achieve victory in combat under circumstances where the strengths and weaknesses are so disparate. This shows why we do mass work, why we see this work as so important to our survival and victory, because it is inseparable. Our mass movement for more than half a year can be divided into three parts to discuss:

1. Experiences and lessons of the past six months: A. The first experience, which can also be said to be a lesson, is that the actual actions of the army itself are the basic conditions for obtaining the faith and support of the masses. It is the foundation for starting civil affairs work. I remember when our army set out from Nanchang, I once gave a report to the service group comrades on civil affairs work in the war zone. I pointed out that the first thing to do is to use the actions of the army itself as the basis for civil affairs work, because we are an army doing civil affairs work, and the first thing is to have strict discipline ourselves in order to gain the trust of the masses. We think that this year, especially in the second half of the year, can further prove this point. For example, in the first half of the year, after our army concentrated, when advancing to the war zone, we did not do propaganda work, and the work only began after the service comrades arrived after the war environment unfolded, but why did many masses everywhere welcome and believe in us, and many masses help us, so that our army gained extremely good faith among the masses in southern Anhui, because our army had extremely good discipline, not only good discipline, but also protected the masses everywhere, and respected the interests of the masses everywhere. Therefore, although we did not have much publicity, we were welcomed everywhere. When our army advanced to the Jiangnan combat area, because of the propaganda of the Japanese army and the propaganda during the past domestic wars, many people did not understand us, but our advance team went and came back, and the Jiangnan masses immediately recognized us. When the main force advanced, the masses welcomed us everywhere. These facts prove this truth: army discipline is the foundation of civil affairs work. Similarly, it proves the opposite: which army has bad discipline, even if it does a lot of publicity, the common people still don't believe it. Many people think that we don't know how much money we spend on publicity work, but we feel very ashamed of the real publicity work. It is because of the actions of our army that we can gain the trust of the masses, and it is much easier to do civil affairs work in this way. B. Second, the victory of combat is a necessary condition for developing civil affairs work. Simply relying on propaganda without fighting, or fighting poorly, the common people say, "Good is good, but it's useless!" In a simple sentence, the reason why we have gained the support of the broad masses in Jiangnan and quickly developed civil affairs work is largely related to our victory in Jiangnan. This is the second experience and lesson. C. Third, the united front is the prerequisite for carrying out civil lotus work. In my last report, I specifically pointed out that everything must go through the united front, and only on the basis of the united front can the masses be mobilized. Today we can also prove that whichever united front is used well, the work can be greatly developed, and where it is a little worse, the work will be a little worse. D. Going deep into the masses is an effective method for mobilizing and organizing the masses. To organize and mobilize, relying solely on propaganda is not enough, and slogans are not enough. These effects are very limited. You must go into the masses to understand the masses, to get close to the masses, and only on this basis can you organize and mobilize them. It is empty to want to do mass work while always standing above the masses. This can be seen from our experience. In the front and rear, where we have not gone deep into the masses, the work is still not enough, and the mobilization of the masses cannot be achieved. This is the fourth experience and lesson. E. Fifth, pay attention to the lives of the masses. This is the main condition for mobilizing the masses to resist Japan, and it can also be said to be a necessary factor. To enable the broad masses to participate in the anti-Japanese war, we must pay attention to their livelihood problems. If we don't find a way to solve their livelihood problems, then we cannot raise their enthusiasm, because this is what they feel personally. Looking at our experience, the place that pays attention to this issue and gives a considerable solution, the anti-Japanese sentiment in that place is different, and the mass movement in the place that does not take this issue into account is much worse, not only in the front, but also in the rear. But we have a principle, under the highest principle of the anti-Japanese war, to solve the livelihood problems, to mobilize the masses for the anti-Japanese war to achieve their participation in the anti-Japanese war, and to solve the suffering of the people from the perspective of the anti-Japanese war. This is a principle, and it is also the fifth experience and lesson of our civil affairs work for more than half a year. F. No matter what mass movement, from the beginning of initiation, continued development, and deepening, the consolidation of mass organizations, if we cannot promote many cadres from the local masses and cultivate cadres to lead the work, this mass movement cannot be developed, and mass organizations will not be consolidated. Only by promoting and cultivating cadres from the local masses can these cadres consolidate and strengthen mass organizations. Without these backbones, it will not work. If that place has considerable cadres, and its own cadres are working, the mass movement will definitely be good. It is obviously ineffective to always ask others to handle it for him. G. Seventh is an experience and lesson in our method. Regarding dramas and costumed speeches, this is the most effective method of rural propaganda. If we have very good dramas suitable for rural areas to improve their sense of combat, it will be more effective than giving very long reports. The general public has not gone to school, so we must pay attention to our level of understanding and adopt various methods. If we give a report like today, the farmers will get dizzy. We say that the methods that have been effective in the countryside since the struggle can be said that speeches and slogans are not very effective, and even artistic pictures are not very effective. If it is a costumed speech or a play, it is different. H. Eighth, civil affairs work and the mobilization of the masses, let us analyze it a little bit. Where there is civil affairs work, the mobilization of the masses is easy; where can it meet the needs of the anti-Japanese war and reduce the difficulty of mobilization? Wherever there are mass organizations, the mobilization will be faster. Masses without organizations have insufficient political understanding, and the mobilization power is small. In short, it is a big weakness in the anti-Japanese war. Why can't the masses be mobilized? It is because there is no organization, so we must do civil affairs work, organize the masses, and rely on mass organizations to meet the requirements of the anti-Japanese war. (To be continued)

### Xiang and E areas are being monitored by us, our army in northern Jiangxi is pressing towards Gao'an and Fengxin, the battles in Jin, Lu, Su, and Yu are still extremely fierce.

[Special Telegram from Chongqing, this newspaper, 15th] On the 15th, our army made smooth progress on all battlefields. The Japanese and puppet troops in northern Wu and Jiangxi stubbornly defended the city. Our troops and the Japanese and puppet forces at Liangjiadu faced each other across the river. Fierce battles continued on the southwest of Gao'an and the shore of the Jinjiang River. Gaoyou City is in our hands. Our large army also has complete control near Fengxin, north of Gao'an. More than a thousand Japanese and puppet troops in Zengcheng, Guangdong, are stubbornly resisting. We are sweeping the city after entering it. On the 12th, our army in Jin captured Fushan again. Currently, the Japanese and puppet reinforcements from Xiaxian and Jiexian have been cut off. The two cities can be taken soon. In the Su territory, we are attacking Piaoyang. Zhongxiang City in central Hubei is still under attack.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Military news: Also, the Japanese army between Hubei and Hunan has mostly concentrated in Yuezhou and Tongcheng, wanting to advance south to attack Changsha, but they are constantly being fiercely attacked by Chinese guerrillas.

[Central News Agency, Yicheng, 15th] Yesterday, a certain unit of our army in central Hubei ambushed the Japanese and puppet troops in Zhangjiezhi Port from Sigang Yangjia, killing more than a hundred and capturing more than ten, and seizing several machine guns and more than forty rifles. The other lines are still in stalemate. A telegram from Huarong reported that about 2,000 Japanese and puppet soldiers took more than a dozen large and small motorboats and fled upstream along the Dieshan River.

The troops of our army attacking Fengxin captured Shangjiangchen, more than ten miles southwest of Fengxin, on the morning of the 13th, killing many Japanese and puppet troops, and are advancing towards the outskirts of Fengxin.

[Reuters, Beijing, 15th] Japanese officials issued a statement yesterday saying that the Chinese army's counterattack on Kaifeng had been repelled, but admitted that the current fighting was still taking place about four miles from the city. Chinese guerrillas are extremely active in many places in North China. It is reported that traffic between Beiping and Nanjing has been blocked by the fighting in Xuzhou. The Chinese army launched a counterattack there two days ago. According to reliable sources, the Chinese army once counterattacked Datong. Several coal mines there were flooded by the Chinese army, and a railway was cut off. Similar news of the Chinese army destroying railways has also been reported from many other places.

### Intense Street Fighting in Zengcheng, the Masses Rose Up, the Japanese and Puppet Troops Suffered Setbacks in Foshan and Junta

[Special Dispatch from Wengyuan, 15th] Frontline phone call: The Chinese army besieging Zengcheng selected daring troops to rush into Zengcheng at dawn on the 14th. Gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls in the city, and loud explosions were heard everywhere. When our follow-up troops advanced to Chali at the hour of Chen, the Japanese and puppet artillery from Shangluogang fired at Zengcheng, covering a unit of about several hundred Japanese infantry to come to aid, intending to divide their forces to meet the attack. Currently, street fighting is taking place in Zengcheng City. The masses near Zengcheng were excited and rose up to assist in the battle. The situation is very fierce.

[Special Dispatch from Wengyuan, 15th] Late news: Zhugangling, ten miles north of Zengcheng, Shetouling in the west, and Zhucun Fuhe Market, which is traversed by the Guang-Zeng traffic line, have been occupied by our army. At the same time, our troops in Luofu Mountain are also approaching the east side of Zengcheng. We have also sent a unit to force out the Shitan-Zengcheng traffic line, effectively encircling Zengcheng.

[Sihui, 15th] At about 4 am this morning, the Japanese and puppet troops in Dali (north of Foshan) suddenly launched a counterattack on our Guanyao Sanjiang and other places. Our defending troops immediately counterattacked. After a fierce battle until 10 am, the Japanese and puppet troops could not hold out and fled back to Foshan. Also, Captain Yagi of the Japanese squadron in the Battle of Makou was indeed killed by us.

[Dongjiang Express News] Our army's counterattack on Zengcheng, under the planning and command of Wu Tingwei, Chief of the General Department of the 9th Army Corps, and Zhaoce, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Army Corps, broke through the city walls on the 14th and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese and puppet troops. The entire city has fallen into the hands of our army. It will not be difficult to wipe out the Japanese and puppet troops stubbornly defending the city in one fell swoop. The details of our army's counterattack on Zengcheng are recorded as follows:

Counterattack Process

According to frontline military news, our army's siege of Zengcheng was divided into three routes. The leading troops were the regiments of Chen Ji, Ni Dingheng, and Wei De, who went straight to Zengcheng along the Bo-Zeng Highway. The troops of Lin Weichou and the Huang Brigade and the Wen Shuhai Brigade met at Gaotan and fiercely attacked the front of Zengcheng. The regiments of Liu Kexiong and Chen Shuying and the Hua Zhenzhong Brigade and the Shi Jishi Division went east along the Conghua-Zengcheng Line, attached to the sides and rear of Zengcheng. The three armies completed the encirclement line after the 13th, and the attack on the city began at 6 pm. The Japanese and puppet troops tried to stop our army from advancing, so they set up more than a dozen steel cannons and more than twenty machine guns at the East Gate Bridge and the Zeng-Cong Station outside the city and stubbornly defended the pre-built defensive fortifications, launching a dense bombardment of our advancing army.

Street Fighting Situation

At that time, our various armies believed that the Japanese and puppet troops stubbornly defending the city were trapped beasts, so to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, they only controlled the high ground outside the northeast gate and took control steps, calmly responding. After a stalemate until about 5 am, the Japanese and puppet forces were exhausted. Seeing that the time had come, our army gave an order and broke through the city walls with the force of a bamboo. The leading plainclothes team first entered the city and engaged in fierce street battles with the remaining Japanese and puppet troops. At dawn, at about 7 am, several Japanese planes suddenly flew from Guangzhou to our army's position in a rotating bombardment, but our officers and soldiers fought to the death, one after another, and continued to rush into the city, in the midst of soaring flames, each occupying broken tiles and hiding walls, short-range fighting, hand-to-hand combat, the battle situation was extremely tragic, and after several hours of melee, the Japanese and puppet troops gradually showed their support, and set fire to the main roads and command posts to stop our advance. For a time, the flames were raging, and dense smoke filled the air, covering the entire city, which could be seen for several miles.

Can Be Taken Soon

After the Japanese and puppet troops defending the city set the fire, most of them fled in a mess, leaving a small part to cover, desperately stopping our pursuit. The remnant Japanese and puppet troops, together with the puppet maintenance association and puppet police, stubbornly resisted. The rest mostly retreated to the Zeng (Cheng) Guang (Zhou) highway station to prevent our army from outflanking them and cutting off their retreat. According to the latest news, the Liang Shiji unit of our army at the North Gate has already copied out the Guang-Zeng line to cut off the retreat of the Japanese and puppet troops. The Japanese and puppet troops are surrounded on both sides and are already shaking. Zengcheng will be officially recovered by evening. As of 12 o'clock, no less than three or four hundred Japanese and puppet soldiers were wounded, their corpses lay everywhere, and blood stained the thoroughfares. More than a hundred residents in the city who failed to escape were detained and massacred by the Japanese and puppet troops. It is difficult to calculate the military supplies and firearms seized at one time.

Wang, the Acting Chairman of the Sakke Banner Mongolian Council, deeply criticized Prince De for attempting to steal the mausoleum of Genghis Khan in his closing remarks, saying, "The traitor De recognizes the thief as his father and is trapped in the mud, unable to extricate himself. He is not only sorry for the party and the country, but also for our ancestors who were outstanding in martial arts. Now he even wants to steal the mausoleum, he is insane. Now we have strict precautions in Yijin Holo, and have sent troops to guard it."

### Progress of Resistance in Guangdong Province: Yu Hanmou Issues Proclamation to the People, "Even If One Breath Remains, the Determination to Overthrow Qin Will Not Waver; With the People's Help, We Will Surely Recover the Strong Spear of Qi"

Recently, our troops on various fronts launched counter-offensives, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. General Yu Hanmou, after the commencement of our army's counter-offensive on the Guangdong battlefield, specially issued a proclamation to the people of Guangdong, saying, "It has been several months since Hanmou communicated with my elders, brothers, sisters, and fellow countrymen. I, conscious of my role as one awaiting punishment, am utterly inadequate. Like Bao Xu weeping blood, I merely harbor the heart to restore Chu; like Yue Shi resting on his spear, I have not yet fulfilled my ambition to swallow the barbarians. I have allowed my countrymen to hold empty hopes for banners, and allowed the Cloud Mountain of Pearl River to be occupied by barbarians for so long, causing me great shame towards my homeland and country. In reason and in emotion, I find it hard to forgive myself. However, Hanmou deeply believes that the fighting spirit of our army has never wavered, and the morale of the people of Guangdong is greatly encouraging. At the same time, I especially believe that the foundation of a long-term resistance war lies with the people, and the future chances of victory ultimately depend on the assistance of the entire population. Therefore, for the past six months, I have endured pain and humiliation, on the one hand, strictly ordering my subordinates to actively train, so that officers and soldiers are united and work hard for success. On the other hand, I have paid special attention to the pacification of local areas and the connection with the people, striving to make military and political affairs converge and progress together, fostering the spirit of sharing weal and woe, and establishing the foundation of cooperation between soldiers and civilians. Fortunately, the comrades of our army and fellow countrymen in various places have been able to share hardships and difficulties, and treat each other with sincerity and without suspicion. Recently, our troops launched attacks, and progress has been made on the eastern, western, and northern fronts. The main reason for our victories is that we have been able to obtain the assistance of local militias and the people. The battle of Hua County is a particularly prominent example. According to the investigation of Hua County, the unit numbers of the troops (officially issued by the Japanese Imperial Army) were the Bobian and Tingjing units. When our army successfully attacked and entered the county seat, the people returned from the mountains en masse, cheering along the streets and helping us carry the spoils of war. The enthusiasm was extremely high. Although this is a small victory and a small advance, it is not of great significance to the gains and losses of the overall war situation. However, this proves that our people sympathize with the War of Resistance and have become more determined over time, and it further proves that the will of our people is where victory lies. Its significance in manifesting the spirit of our nation and strengthening the belief of our people is extremely important. This is why Hanmou does not dare to be trifling and dares to report this to comfort my elders, brothers, sisters, and fellow countrymen. Alas, we admire the people of Yan who refuse to submit to the strong, so Li Yu returned with his spear. Startled by the shouts of the masses, the Khitans retreated. From ancient times, the morale of the people has been enough to suppress the enemy's atmosphere. Moreover, the mountains and rivers of Guangdong have nurtured a spirit of righteousness and bravery. The battle blood of the Pomegranate Flower Pagoda is still fresh, and the spirit of the Three Yuanli is not far away. The years are getting colder and the seasons are apparent, how can the ancient times be different from now? Therefore, the power of the people that will be brought into play in the future will provide greater and more inspiring assistance to our army. This can also be pre-announced to comfort my elders, brothers, sisters, and fellow countrymen. As long as Hanmou has one breath left, I am determined to make an early decision. The shame of residing in Ju has not been washed away, and the determination to overthrow Qin will not waver. Some of you are displaced abroad, and your grief is even deeper. Some of you are trapped in the occupied areas, and your cries are not heard. All these feelings are my fault. I vow to exhaust the remaining years of my life to save my homeland and repay my country. In these difficult times, I will do my utmost to serve. I respectfully present these meager words, hoping for your enlightened consideration. (Central News Agency)"

### Southwest Headquarters Values Improving People's Livelihood; Formulates Measures to Lift People Out of Poverty and Blockade Enemy Areas; Orders Subordinates to Implement Them Conscientiously

[Special Dispatch from Qujiang] The political department of the Southwest Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission reported that the enemy used political tactics to win over the hearts of the people. Recently, transportation in various places has been inconvenient, and the distribution of materials has been uneven, resulting in a shortage of daily necessities. Even if there are any, the supply cannot meet the demand, and the prices are high. Villagers are forced by life to take risks, which is a great obstacle to the future of the war of resistance. Now that the second phase of the War of Resistance has begun, it is imperative to win over the people. Therefore, to eliminate this kind of bad phenomenon, we must first alleviate the suffering of the people, and then find ways to prevent and control it, so that we can achieve results. Yesterday, special countermeasures were proposed: (1) The military and political authorities in various places should find ways to regulate materials and assess prices, so as to ensure that supply and demand are met, and the burden on the people is reduced. (2) Intensify propaganda work, expose the enemy's conspiracies, and urge the people to conscientiously implement the anti-Japanese public agreement. (3) Strictly implement the anti-blockade policy against enemy areas, and strictly inspect import and export trade goods and mail. If they are enemy goods, they will be detained and handed over to the local anti-Japanese support association for disposal, but no disturbances are allowed under any pretext. (4) Once private enemy merchants are detected, they should be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. These strategies have been separately telegraphed to the various political departments under their jurisdiction for implementation, and they have also been instructed to follow them. The political department of the Fourth War Zone received the telegram and ordered its subordinates to implement it.

### Guangdong Formulates Administrative Program

[Special Dispatch from Shaoguan] Since Li Hanun, chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, took office in January of this year, he has believed that the facilities of the provincial government during the war of resistance should be coordinated with military affairs. He then ordered the various departments to study administrative plans within their respective jurisdictions in order to adapt to the wartime environment. It is reported that the Guangdong Provincial Wartime Administrative Program has now been formulated based on the findings of the various departments. The content of the program is divided into three parts: political, economic, and cultural. Special attention is paid to promoting the morale of the people and implementing the National Spiritual Mobilization. It will be promulgated and implemented after being passed by the next provincial affairs meeting, so as to reform politics, develop the economy, and promote culture.

### Impression of the Guerrilla Army in Southern Shanxi (Part 1)

(Communication from Northwestern Shanxi) I ran to the front line and heard many stories about the guerrilla army in southern Shanxi from the local people. Of course, these stories were both good and bad. Some said that this part of the army was not polite to the people, while others said that this part of the army often fought against the Japanese, and had won many victories. A comrade from the County Mobilization Committee told me this story:

"On September 18th, Commander Du suddenly asked the cadres... 'What day is today?' Then he gave an order and personally led two teams to attack the Japanese near the Tongpu Railway. After the attack, he gathered the troops and gave a speech, roughly saying... 'We use battle to commemorate September 18th!'"

Hearing the words from all sides, I had such a guess about the guerrilla army in southern Shanxi... "Commander Du may be a hero from the military? Is there a problem with extreme democracy in military discipline?"

On December 4th last year, the weather was so clear. We were still hanging around the battlefield after the Battle of Xinkou and walked to ×× Village. This is the front line, and there is always the possibility of contact with the Japanese, so the sentries on the mountain were heavily guarded. When we entered the village entrance, the sentries interrogated us very strictly.

We were invited by the headquarters to stay in a village one or two miles nearby. Then, two comrades in charge went to see Commander Du to discuss the condolences. As a result, it was agreed that we would clumsily carry out the condolences at 4:00 p.m. We came out to offer condolences this time, and we could never complete the work according to the scheduled time. We were very happy that we could complete the task that day, but when the time came, Commander Du was nowhere to be seen. We ran to the village entrance several times to look around, but there was no sign of him. While we were anxious, Chief of Staff Gao came with Captain Zhou and two political workers.

Chief of Staff Gao is a man of eloquence, with a sharp tongue. When he speaks, it is like a cannon of words. Except for one or two comrades in charge who stated our intention, the rest of us listened silently. He first explained the reason why Commander Du could not come today, because he was busy with military affairs and could not spare any time. The condolence event was changed to tomorrow. Then he introduced the origin of the guerrilla army in southern Shanxi and talked about many practical issues.

After listening to Chief Gao's words, I knew that this part of the army grew up in battle, and now it has grown strong. In the constant battles, the Japanese were dealt a great blow, such as the battle of Yanzhuang Weicun, which achieved a great victory, won the support of the people, and inspired the soldiers' anti-Japanese sentiment. Commander Du was not as I imagined, on the contrary, he was a refined "Confucian general," who had studied in the United States for many years. Because he was heartbroken by the fall of half of the country, he abandoned his comfortable life and ran to the front line to fight to the death with the Japanese. In several battles, the Japanese artillery hit near him. Military discipline is also particularly strict, and soldiers who violate the interests of the people or desert are shot. Chief Gao especially pointed out that the previous misunderstandings with various parties were because there was no political training office. When he praised this point, he glanced at the two political workers who accompanied him and said happily:

"Now it's good! Our political training office has been established, and from now on we can integrate with the people!"

The next day, as soon as the sun came out, Commander Du came. He was of medium height, wearing a coarse gray military uniform, with a very gentle attitude, without any bureaucratic habits. He was calm and taciturn and introduced himself to us. Then he led us to comfort the army.

The team was gathered in a square outside the village. What caught our eyes was the strict formation, complete weapons, and high morale. They sang majestic songs to welcome us.

After we explained our intention and offered warm condolences to them, we then respectfully presented Commander Du with a blue sky and white sun flag with the four characters "National Hero" written on it. Commander Du held the national flag in his hand, fluttering in the breeze. The soldiers who defended the motherland saluted, and then Commander Du gave a speech. He said: "This is the national flag of the Republic of China, and everyone should respect it! Everyone should respond to the kindness of the condolence delegation and plant the national flag of the Republic of China all over China! Recover the lost land and drive the Japanese out!" After the speech, he calmly said to the soldiers: "Are we afraid of the Japanese, or are the Japanese afraid of us?"

"The Japanese are afraid of us!" It was a firm and loud answer.

Finally, Commander Du led the soldiers to sing, led the soldiers to shout slogans: "Fight to the last soldier!" "Fight to the last gun!" The resolute roar echoed in the mountains.

After the condolences, Commander Du accompanied us to our residence and talked with us earnestly. We ate breakfast while listening to him talk, and he patiently told us about the battle and introduced his background. He said that he was very willing to be with the students. Before parting, he revealed his reluctance.

After this condolence visit, the guerrilla army in southern Shanxi left a deep impression on my mind. In Commander Du's environment, it is very possible to live in Kamchatka and live a life of Western-style buildings and cars. However, he, he loves the life of battle! He wants the freedom of his motherland! (To be continued)

### Our Army's Recent Victory Extensively Praised by British Newspapers Yesterday; Famous French Journalist Li Meng Arrives in Shashi

[Central News Agency, London, 15th] Today, the Daily Telegraph published an article extensively praising China's recent successful military operations.

### Guangdong Province Regulates Military and Civilian Food Supply

[Shaoguan Quick News] Zhang Fakui, commander-in-chief of the Fourth War Zone, believes that the food supply for our troops on the front line is extremely important at a time when the military counter-offensive in Guangdong Province is making steady progress. In addition to finding ways to provide large-scale assistance, in order to seek mutual assistance and regulation of food supplies on various fronts, he specially ordered the food management office in the area to investigate the actual food situation of the military and civilians in various places on the front line. It is reported that Shen Pengfei, the director of the office, has been ordered to send personnel to the eastern, western, and northern routes of Guangdong Province to conduct thorough investigations. It is also planned to establish food supply stations in convenient locations on various routes to provide food for the troops and to contact the local government to provide food for the fleeing people.

### Increase Production and Expand Spring Plowing

[Qujiang Quick News] Li Hanun, chairman of the provincial government, pays close attention to developing wartime production and increasing food for the people.

Methods for promotion have now been formulated, and the main points are to strictly order the county, district, and township offices to effectively supervise farmers to cultivate as much of the original cultivated land as possible, and to force them to cultivate wasteland. Otherwise, the district office will hire workers to cultivate the land on behalf of the farmers. Production cooperatives for refugees in the war zone will be organized, and the provincial bank or relief agency will provide loans to undertake wasteland cultivation. Detailed joint methods have been handed over to the construction department for processing and will be implemented in the short and medium term.

### The New Provincial Capital of Guangdong: The New Posture of Qujiang

— Tang Shi

[Special Article from This Newspaper] With the shift in military needs, the capital of Guangdong Province has moved from Guangzhou to Lian County, and then from Lian County to Qujiang. At present, Qujiang has become the political center of Guangdong Province. Recently, most of the national salvation groups have also gathered here. In the past, this was only an important transportation point on the Yuehan Road, and the national salvation movement was relatively deserted. However, now it has shown a vigorous and active scene.

Although the enemy cruelly bombed most of the prosperous area here—the shops and houses along Fengdu South Road from Zhifenglie Road to Qujiang Bridge into a field of rubble, the other areas that have not been poisoned are still operating as usual. Groups and teams of young men's heroic teams pass through the streets from time to time. The neat steps and loud songs show that the newly born force in the second stage is in the midst of rapid development. The extra-large wall newspapers on the streets, with popular text, vivid satirical pictures, clear maps, and concise and powerful slogans, have completely changed the dry and empty style of the past and appeared in a brand-new posture. In addition to armed comrades, young men and women comrades in blue twill uniforms who are engaged in the national salvation movement also pass by in a hurry.

I have only been here for two days, but I have met no less than hundreds of comrades who used to work together. After they withdrew from Guangzhou, they scattered to various places along the East River and South River. Some served in the army on the front line, some joined the guerrillas in the occupied areas, and some were engaged in civilian transportation in the rear. However, recently, many groups have gathered here unexpectedly—of course, this does not mean that they have put down their work and come, but that each group has a part of its members who have come here. Some are being trained, some are passing through this place for a temporary stay, and there are also some groups organized by government agencies who have been assigned to work here on a regular basis. The following is a summary of the information gathered from various sources:

The groups currently in Qujiang include the Anti-Japanese Vanguard General Team, the Anti-Japanese Youth Vanguard Group, the Youth Group, the Women's Working Committee of the New Life Movement, the Political Work Brigade of the Fourth War Zone, the Fifth Political Work Brigade of the Military Affairs Commission, the First Brigade of the Provincial Relief Committee, the Security Political Brigade, the Social Service Office organized by the Provincial Party Department, and the Qujiang County People's Education Center.

1. Anti-Japanese Vanguard General Team

"Anti-Japanese Vanguard" is the abbreviation of the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard Team. Before the fall of Guangzhou, it was a unified youth organization. At that time, there were about 2,000 people. On January 21st last year, they set off on foot from Guangzhou. At that time, most of the members of the political work team organized by the Guangdong Provincial Mobilization Committee were from the Anti-Japanese Vanguard. Later, they gradually developed while working in various places, and 17 branch offices (i.e., county team headquarters) have been established in various counties. It is estimated that there are a total of 23 county team headquarters in the budget. The general team headquarters was originally located in Xinxing, and only moved to Qujiang in early February.

From March 21st to 24th, the Anti-Japanese Vanguard General Team Headquarters held its third plenary committee meeting. Local party and government leaders attended the meeting to provide guidance. In addition to reviewing past work, it also decided on the following guidelines for the youth movement:

(1) Believe in the Three Principles of the People, practice the program of resisting the war and building the country, sincerely support the government, support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, support the united front, and participate in all anti-Japanese work.

(2) Urgently mobilize the vast number of young people to join the team, to various armed teams, directly participate in the war, and urgently mobilize the people to launch guerrilla warfare in the battlefield and in the occupied areas, and to attack and eliminate the Japanese.

(3) Call on young people to actively participate in various military and political training classes organized by the government to cultivate military and political cadres.

(4) Based on the principles of consolidating unity, opposing division, helping each other, developing each other, and people's livelihood, enrich the existing youth organizations in various places, and then establish a unified front for the youth of the province.

Recently, various committee members have returned to various places to promote their work. The daily work of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard includes the following aspects:

(1) Armed Team—About 300 people work in the 12th Army, and another part of them are fighting guerrillas in the Zengcheng area.

(2) Civilian Group—Establishing civilian anti-Japanese associations, civilian training classes, etc. in various villages.

(3) Uniting Youth—There is already a preliminary foundation for a unified organization in the province, with a recent population of more than 6,000.

(4) Self-education—Every week, team members have group meetings, seminars, marching exercises, etc.

2. Anti-Japanese Youth Vanguard Group

Also withdrew from Guangzhou on "October 21st" last year. However, because the withdrawal time was more urgent, it felt very embarrassed, resulting in considerable losses. The total number of people in the group is relatively small, about 200. Their work is divided into three aspects: one is to participate in the work mainly held by the government, one is to develop civilian organizations, and one is to gather the original members and absorb new members to engage in supplementation and adjustment. The general team headquarters is also currently located in Qujiang.

### Britain, France, and the Soviet Union Consider Air Force Cooperation; British-Soviet Diplomatic Talks Underway; Joint Assistance to Guaranteed Countries

[Reuters, London, 15th] The diplomatic correspondent of the "Daily Mail" here declared in a discussion of British-Soviet diplomatic talks today that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are now considering air force cooperation in order to take joint action when the countries they guarantee are attacked. The correspondent pointed out that the biggest difficulty at the moment is that Poland and Romania are hesitant about the Soviet Union's wartime assistance, but all parties believe that the two countries will welcome the Soviet Union's air force assistance. At the same time, the two countries also hope that the Soviet Union will guarantee the supply of raw materials, financial resources, and manufactured goods. Therefore, all parties suggested that the three powers should take air force cooperation in addition to military cooperation. The correspondent also said that the British government is now paying close attention to the increasing threat to British interests in Egypt and Gibraltar. The Ministry of War has been holding continuous meetings to study the military defense plan for the two places if recent military activities are necessary.

[Central News Agency, Gibraltar, 15th] The work of setting up military obstacles here is still in progress. The two entrances to the British naval commander's port have been blocked.

[Reuters, London, 15th] The British ambassador to the Soviet Union visited Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov today on the instructions of the government to further discuss British-Soviet talks. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the British side did not disclose the nature of this meeting, but it is generally believed that since Britain has given guarantees to Poland and Romania, the Soviet Union's border has also been guaranteed. The current plan is to seek how the Soviet Union can provide support when either of the two countries is attacked. At the same time, Britain is continuing to discuss the Balkan issue with Turkey.

[Associated Press, London, 14th] The British Foreign Office today issued a special instruction to the British ambassador to the Soviet Union. The content is unknown, but it is heard that the British ambassador will hold a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov in the near future. This may be a sign that Britain and the Soviet Union will establish a limited military agreement. It is said that unless the Italian troops stationed in Western Italy withdraw in early May, Britain will be forced to announce the abandonment of the British-Italian friendship agreement. According to unconfirmed reports, the British ambassador is about to negotiate with the Soviet government to conclude an air force agreement. Due to the difficulty of land cooperation, this matter is logically correct. Diplomatic circles believe that Hitler is now conducting diplomatic opposition to Lithuania, which is actually Hitler's first response to the "anti-Hitler" group.

[Associated Press, London, 14th] The news that the British Foreign Office issued a special instruction to the British ambassador to the Soviet Union has been officially confirmed. The meeting between the British ambassador and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov has been changed to Saturday. Although the future of the British-Soviet aviation agreement is uncertain, it is believed that the British side is preparing to conduct serious negotiations with the Soviet Union.

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Since Britain and France provided guarantees to Romania and Greece, the diplomatic activities of the democratic countries have continued unabated. They are now working hard to strengthen the second link in the anti-aggression chain, that is, the relationship between Poland and Romania. According to reports, Poland and Romania have already signed an alliance. At the same time, negotiations with the Soviet Union are still ongoing. All parties hope to agree on satisfactory measures with Moscow, and the Soviet Union will indirectly provide material assistance to Poland and Romania. Because France originally signed a consultation agreement with the Soviet Union, this negotiation with the Soviet Union is actually led by France (rather than Britain). Yugoslavia's attitude is still doubtful, but it is heard that Bulgaria has expressed dissatisfaction with the Albanian incident and does not dare to cooperate with the Axis countries, believing that the spearhead of destroying the Balkans. If Bulgaria can maintain good relations with the Balkan countries, a line of resistance to aggression can still be established there.

### Repercussions of the Anglo-French Declaration

[London, 14th Dispatch] The major resolutions of all parties in the House of Commons regarding the Prime Minister's declaration yesterday are uniformly supported, as can be seen in today's newspaper commentaries. The Times, citing the guarantees given to Poland, Greece, and Romania, stated that these three countries, traditionally seen as standing at the forefront of aggressive violence, can now have their worries alleviated somewhat. This is because if they are forced to fight for freedom, it will not be just these three countries that are fighting. British policy has taken a major step forward. This action by Britain is not a careless measure, and its commitment to this responsibility was carefully considered beforehand, understanding the meaning of this responsibility. This move by Britain can represent a correct national self-determination arising from the evolution of the current situation, and it is flawless, they say.

[Reuters, Moscow, 15th Dispatch] All Soviet newspapers have published Chamberlain's speech in detail, but without any commentary. A Soviet spokesperson, while refusing to criticize, indicated that the Soviet Union's attitude towards the effectiveness of Britain's new policy of stopping aggression is not as cold and mocking as it was during the Munich Agreement last September, they say.

[Reuters, Athens, 15th Dispatch] The Prime Minister's declaration in the House of Commons, guaranteeing Greek independence, has made a very positive impression here. The public is very welcoming of Britain's new policy, believing it is sufficient to resist the demons of brutal destruction. All newspapers have published the speech in a prominent position, but without commentary.

[Capital of Yugoslavia, 15th Dispatch] Although there is no criticism here regarding the declaration by the heads of the British and French governments guaranteeing Romania and Greece, the public welcomes it warmly, they say.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 14th Dispatch] Following Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons and the announcement of unilateral guarantees to Greece, Berlin political circles believe that Britain's continued promotion of its encirclement policy against Germany is an undeniable fact. However, the question remains whether Greece and Romania are willing to accept British protection. It is recalled that Germany and Romania previously concluded a commercial agreement, deepening relations between the two countries. Mussolini has also expressed friendship towards Greece. Therefore, Berlin believes that Britain's guarantee is not intended to maintain peace, but rather to preemptively seize military strongholds for combat. Britain is currently seeking naval bases in the Black Sea and the Adriatic Sea. The British Prime Minister's declaration stated that if necessary, an agreement could be concluded with Greece immediately. This situation is very similar to the position of the Allied forces and Greece before the European War. It is recalled that in 1915, British and French troops disregarded Greece's neutrality and landed in Salonica, continuing to occupy Athens and other places. Under these circumstances, Greece was then forced to join the Allied forces. This time, Greece's acceptance of the British guarantee is intended to avoid a second British invasion. The Romanian Foreign Minister will go to Berlin on April 18, and Greek cabinet members are also preparing to attend the celebration of Hitler's birthday. These two events are enough to prove that these two countries do not feel threatened by Germany. In short, the German side has a very low assessment of Britain's stance, but believes that reintroducing Soviet Russia into the European vortex is the greatest crisis. Daladier's concise speech shows that France is deeply dependent on Britain, they say.

[Associated Press, Rome, 14th Dispatch] Gayda commented in today's "Italian Daily" harshly criticizing Chamberlain's remarks on the Albanian event and declaring that Britain has no interests in the Adriatic Sea. Gayda, referring to Daladier's declaration, said it was not worth commenting on, because France has been insignificant in the European political arena since deceiving Italy in 1935.

[Haitong News Agency, Hungarian Capital, 4th Dispatch] The Anglo-French guarantee is currently being considered here from the perspective of Hungarian reformers. The general view is that the declarations of the two major Western democracies do not constitute an absolute guarantee of the sovereignty of the two Balkan countries under any strong demands. Therefore, a peaceful revision of the treaty is not absolutely impossible. A certain newspaper strongly stated that Chamberlain and Daladier's official statements do not guarantee Romania's existing borders, and that there are still unresolved issues between Hungary and Romania that must be resolved before the establishment of good neighborly relations, they say.

### German Military Movements Busy in the German-Austrian Region; Spanish Troops Move Closer to the French Border; France Has Increased Border Defense Strength; Germany and Italy Plot to Partition Yugoslavia

[Associated Press, Paris, 14th Dispatch] After France learned that 5,000 Spanish troops had moved into Villa, a village only three miles from the French border, it quickly dispatched a large army to the Pyrenees border to strengthen defenses. At the same time, the French also dispatched troops to garrison near Gibraltar, where Spanish troops were concentrated in Rani Li, and heavy artillery such as Zuke vehicles had appeared. British engineers in Gibraltar have cut off the passage between Gibraltar and Rani Li. According to reports from visitors to the French border, German troops are active in the Rhine region and near Trier and Strasbourg. Foreign experts believe that German troops are moving east along the Yugoslav border towards Poland.

[Associated Press, Capital of Yugoslavia, 14th Dispatch] Senior officials here have recently confirmed the Associated Press report on Thursday, stating that Italy has offered a guarantee to the border between Yugoslavia and Germany. Informed sources believe that if Yugoslavia refuses this guarantee, Italy will collude with Germany to partition Yugoslavia.

[Haitong News Agency, Jerusalem, 15th Dispatch] Over the past few days, British troops stationed near Haifa along the coast of Palestine have been practicing with new long-range artillery. Also, most of the British troops stationed in Lydda have been deployed to Egypt. According to the "De Xia" newspaper, local newspapers are not allowed to publish information about troop movements.

### Moroccans Oppose Germany and Italy, Organize Marches and Demonstrations

[Reuters, Gallong Bulanga, 14th Dispatch] Today, a large group of Moroccans marched and demonstrated against Germany and Italy here. The crowd first went to the Muslim temple to pray, and then marched around, shouting slogans against totalitarian countries and calling Italy "Public Enemy Number One of Muslims." When they were about to march towards the Italian consulate, the police stopped them and dispersed them. They later sent representatives to meet with the authorities to protest Italy's policies towards Muslims, "especially the annexation of Albania," expressing dissatisfaction.

[Reuters, London, 15th Dispatch] The Albanian ambassador here recently sent a reply to the Albanian Foreign Minister, declaring, "I do not recognize the government established with foreign support," asking the Albanian Foreign Minister to value the government.

Italy to Send Governor-General to Albania

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 15th Dispatch] According to news here last night, the Italian Governor-General to Albania will be filled by a member of the royal family. It is generally believed that the Duke of Bergamo will be elected. Duke Yao is currently the commander-in-chief of the Milan military region and showed his skills during the Abyssinian War. It is said that because the Duke has rich military experience, he is considered the most suitable person during this military operation.

### Rumors of Germany and Italy Preparing to Attack Southeastern Europe; German Army and Navy Conduct Spring Maneuvers; Berlin Announces Start Next Month; Greece Pays Close Attention to Soviet Ship Movements

[Associated Press, Athens, 14th Dispatch] The optimism caused by the announcement of British and French guarantees to Greece has recently been hit, as the German fleet's exercise in the western Mediterranean has been officially announced. Also, three Soviet destroyers have sailed from the Black Sea to Helespont. It is generally believed that the Soviet ships may be heading to the Far East, but so far, they have not been seen entering the Suez Canal. If the western Mediterranean is cut off, the British and French guarantees to Greece will be weakened. It is reported that a large amount of Italian military supplies are currently being poured into Albania, and it is also rumored that the Axis countries are preparing to attack Macedonia (southeastern Europe).

[Associated Press, Berlin, 14th Dispatch] The German army authorities have ordered the mobilization of soldiers of all ranks in the Berlin area in preparation for spring maneuvers, which have been officially announced to begin next month. About 40 German warships will participate in this spring maneuver, and will start departing for Spanish waters next Tuesday. At the same time, Hitler is studying a response to the British and French encirclement movement. The German side said that this spring maneuver is being held as usual and has nothing to do with the current situation in the Mediterranean, but it is intended to show the cooperation of the Axis countries at sea.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 14th Dispatch] Informed sources here believe that the joint German-Italian fleet in the Mediterranean is sufficient to compete with the British and French fleets currently in the Mediterranean.

### Germany Fabricates Report, Says Poles Mistreat Germans

[Associated Press, Berlin, 15th Dispatch] The official news agency here, after remaining silent for several days, today published a large number of reports, stating that anti-German demonstrations are taking place everywhere in Poland, and Germans are being mistreated. It claims that countless Germans have suffered losses of life and property for speaking German, and that these anti-German movements by Poles are self-organized.

### US President Approves Additional Appropriation of $100 Million for Relief

[Reuters, Washington, 14th Dispatch] President Roosevelt today approved an additional appropriation of $100 million for relief.

### British King's Broadcast, May 24th

[Reuters, London, 15th Dispatch] The British Broadcasting Corporation announced today that the British King will deliver a broadcast speech at Willing P. at 7:00 pm on May 24th. The company also stated that during the King's trip to Canada, the company will provide detailed broadcast reports at any time.

### Goering Arrives in Italy, Meets Mussolini Yesterday, Returns to Berlin Tomorrow Afternoon

—Goering—

[Central News Agency, Rome, 14th Dispatch] German Aviation Minister General Goering, who recently visited the Italian colony of Libya in North Africa, returned here at noon today for a formal visit. Prime Minister Mussolini, Foreign Minister Ciano, and the Chief of the Army General Staff all personally welcomed him. General Goering will meet with the Italian King at noon tomorrow for lunch, and then visit Prime Minister Mussolini. He is scheduled to return to Berlin on the afternoon of the 17th of this month.

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 15th Dispatch] On Saturday at noon, the Italian King received German Aviation Minister Goering and hosted a banquet with the Queen to entertain Goering and his wife. The German ambassador and his wife were also invited to attend. Before entering the palace, General Goering, accompanied by German officials, went to the Italian Royal Mausoleum and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and Fascist Party Martyrs to offer wreaths. The streets through which General Goering passed were crowded with people who warmly cheered.

### Siam and Vietnam

In the future world war, Siam is probably the only Far Eastern nation easily tempted by fascist aggressor countries!

For the sake of mutual restraint between Britain and France, Siam's fate is better than its neighbors Burma and Annam. From the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries onwards, it has always been a buffer state and has not suffered the pain of national subjugation, but its territory has been partially cut off nine times.

Siam has a population of 15 million, and our compatriots account for 2.5 million. In addition to fearing the partition by Britain and France, we also worry about the economic power in the country falling into the hands of overseas Chinese. Therefore, Siam's position in Asia today is similar to Hungary's position in Europe. What it demands is to recover the lost territories since the last century and to achieve true independence and autonomy.

This is a legitimate demand of the Siamese nation. Unfortunately, Siam has not used legitimate revolutionary means to achieve its legitimate demands. In order to oppose imperialism, it has instead embraced imperialism. Since the September 18th Incident, Siam has been the only Asian country that openly expresses pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese sentiments. In 1933, when the League of Nations passed a resolution condemning Japan, only Siam abstained. Overseas Chinese in Siam are often subjected to cruel treatment, and freedom of speech and assembly for anti-Japanese activities is completely deprived.

In recent years, the Siamese army has employed Japanese advisors and purchased Japanese weapons. It is greatly influenced by Japan politically. Japan wants to lend money to Siam to dig the Kra Canal, so that Far Eastern ships can reach the Indian Ocean directly without passing through Singapore. If this project succeeds, it will undoubtedly seriously damage Britain's military and commercial position in the Far East. Although this plan has been temporarily shelved due to British opposition, it has not been completely abandoned.

Since the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact by Germany, Italy, and Japan, German influence has also penetrated into Siam. The number of weapons supplied by Germany to Siam is quite large. This has further increased the uneasiness of Britain and France. Although Siam has not yet joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, key figures in the Siamese government have repeatedly expressed sympathy for the governments of the Anti-Comintern Group. (To be continued)

### Franco's Troops Prepare to Announce Demobilization

[Reuters, Paris, 14th Dispatch] According to a Havas news report, General Franco's triumphal entry into Madrid may be postponed until May 15th. Once Franco triumphantly enters the city, foreign volunteers in the Spanish army will withdraw, and Spanish troops will also announce their demobilization at the same time. It is said that May 15th is the festival of Saint Isidore, the patron saint of Madrid.

### Searches for Nazi Party Members in the Capital of Argentina, Key Member Katzmann Arrested

[Associated Press, Capital of Argentina, 15th Dispatch] Police conducted a major search in the Nazi centers of Cordoba and Tucuman provinces, capturing many Nazi personnel. A large number of propaganda materials shipped from Germany were confiscated. Customs officials said that multiple vehicles of propaganda materials were seized in Silver, all belonging to Nazi key member Katzmann, who has already been arrested.

Short Commentary

### Anglo-French-Soviet Negotiations on Air Force Cooperation

Yesterday, the diplomatic correspondent of the London Daily Telegraph reported, "The authorities of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are currently considering announcing a plan in which the air forces of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will take joint action when any country they guarantee is attacked. The current diplomatic negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are related to this plan."

Whether this news can become a reality is, of course, inconvenient to speculate, but at least it proves that Britain and France currently feel this need, and this news is welcomed by most people in Britain and France. Because to resist aggression and safeguard peace, it is impossible without uniting the Soviet Union. This has long become common knowledge. However, to unite the Soviet Union, it is definitely not enough to just say it. There must be a close cooperation in fact, and the cooperation of the British, French, and Soviet air forces will be an effective guarantee for democratic and peace-loving countries to resist aggression and stop the scourge of war in the future.

We welcome the cooperation of the British, French, and Soviet air forces to become a reality, needless to say. But in order to truly safeguard peace, and not limit it to temporary and partial measures, there is still a need to consider the naval cooperation of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Only in this way can we guarantee the collective security of Northeast Europe, the Near East, and the Far East. If this demand can be realized, we believe that the three major aggressor devils of Germany, Italy, and Japan will have to bow their heads! If we work hard, if the anti-aggression movement of the people of democratic and peace-loving countries progresses, this demand will never be an empty ideal!

### Roosevelt's Speech, Severely Condemning Acts of Aggression, Fully Defending Peace in the Americas, Hoping to Rebuild International Discipline

Roosevelt

(Associated Press, Washington, 14th Dispatch) US President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the Board of Directors of the Pan American Union today, and broadcast his speech to the world in six languages.

(Reuters, Washington, 14th Dispatch) US President Roosevelt, delivered a speech at the Board of Directors of the Pan American Union today, saying, "The Old World is now trapped in a tragic vortex." Old hatreds and new grievances have erupted at the same time, and the reason why the Americas can insist on being independent is because the Americas, when gaining independence and freedom, extravagantly produced a new and strong ideal, that is, to establish an international union. Pan-American countries have openly met and established open agreements, "We hold meetings not as a result of war, but because we hope for peace." The President continued, the Old World's entry into a new stage of disaster is not a matter of fate, "Humans are not prisoners of fate, but only driven by their own ambitions. A few days ago, the leader of a certain great power pointed out that his country was a prisoner of the Mediterranean, and later the head of a certain great power, upon learning that its neighbor had agreed to defend the independence of its first neighbor, actually considered this agreement a threat and encirclement. But in fact, there is absolutely no reason for any peace-loving country to encircle, threaten, or imprison other peace-loving countries." Roosevelt then criticized "the delusion of conquering others," considering it "a ridiculous and criminal act." He also said, "The peace of the Americas that we celebrate today has no weakness. We are prepared to maintain and defend this peace with all our strength. If anyone attempts to undermine this organization and harm any member of our group, we will resolutely retaliate with force. If anyone uses economic oppression as a means, I guarantee that we will also use our country's economic strength as a support, so that no country in the Americas will sacrifice its sovereign freedom in exchange for economic benefits." Roosevelt then said that the countries of the Americas will now also announce their position to the world, "What we are concerned about is not how to defend our coastline alone. The economic structure has gradually made the world a unit. When any place is disturbed by it, it will affect other places. People of the next generation will feel the need to find ways for the Old and New Worlds to coexist and prosper, unless we become a dependency of other countries, then we have the right to state that we have the right to participate in the organization of any international affairs. The concept of the Americas' unwavering commitment to maintaining peace is even more dependent on countries overseas being able to abandon the idea of war. We are also the mainstay of the international situation. Our desire for peace and our belief in mutual defense are equally strong, so that the spirit of temporary victory and the pursuit of invaluable glory are transformed into a spirit of loyalty, sacrifice, and discipline. Only then can we rebuild international discipline. This is the admonition of the New World to the Old World." Roosevelt then said that he believed that the republics of the New World still have enough strength to help the Old World prevent terrible events from happening. Referring to the protest of totalitarian countries being surrounded, Roosevelt said that last year the United States guaranteed Canada that if Canada was attacked from overseas, the United States would unite with it to resist, and later issued a Pan-American declaration in Lima, expressing cooperation to protect its organization from direct or indirect external aggression, "But no country considers that this has made another country a prisoner of other countries, or has been surrounded by other countries. Our measures are not a guarantee of war, but a guarantee of peace, because no country in the Americas intends to invade or monopolize self-esteem. If this move is successful here, can this move not be successful elsewhere? Do we think that only by applying destructive means from hundreds of years ago can we achieve our goals? Will our culture be forever trapped in the tragic vortex of bottomless militarism and constant wars, unable to extricate ourselves? Or will we maintain the ideal of peace and individual culture, and regard this as an essential companion in our lives?"

Debate over American Policy, Two Factions Form

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th Dispatch] After Roosevelt's speech, the debate over American foreign policy has clearly formed opposing positions. Some people are quite skeptical of Roosevelt's intention to interfere in European affairs, because no one can determine what range of military and economic assistance is sufficient to avoid being drawn into the European war. At present, the government's foreign policy, since Roosevelt and Hull's speeches, has clearly determined the path: (1) The United States is willing to provide military and economic assistance to Latin American countries to cope with the aggression of dictators; (2) The United States will lead the countries of the Western Hemisphere to unanimously oppose countries that take war and conquest as their own; (3) If war occurs, the United States will never participate, but will do its best to make the war stop. Those who support the president, such as key members of the Democratic Party and Republican Stimson, unanimously support this view, believing that the United States' interference in European affairs can achieve world peace. Those who oppose Roosevelt's policy are mostly senators, who believe that Roosevelt's speech has only made the atmosphere of the European war more tense, and may cause a certain country to act rashly.

[Associated Press, London, 14th Dispatch] There is unanimous praise here for Roosevelt's speech. All parties hope that Roosevelt's speech can make the military activities of totalitarian countries slightly restrained.

[Associated Press, Paris, 14th Dispatch] There is great welcome here for Roosevelt's speech, especially the emphasis on Roosevelt's denial of the encirclement policy being carried out by various countries and the expression that the air force can cross oceans in the future, because the latter clearly reflects the military aspect of the United States.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 14th Dispatch] Officials here condemned Roosevelt's speech, saying that Roosevelt was the precursor to Chamberlain's encirclement policy. The propaganda department said, "How can we hope to obtain other language from the mouth of the father of the encirclement policy, as called by American reporters?"

### Hong Kong Governor Revises Emergency Ordinance, Authorizes Police Superintendents and Medical Officers to Detain Foreigners; Hong Kong Navy Simultaneously Promulgates Defense Emergency Order, Allowing Naval Volunteer Force to Serve Outside Hong Kong

The European situation is unstable. Whether a world war will break out depends solely on the actions of totalitarian states. Democratic countries around the world, awakened by China's resistance, are determined to maintain peace by armed force. The local authorities here have followed British national policy and made all wartime preparations. In addition to strengthening the army, navy, air force, and air defense capabilities, they have also strictly regulated public order laws to prevent foreigners from causing disturbances in Hong Kong. According to the gazette published yesterday morning, the Governor, in conjunction with the Executive Council, revised the Emergency Ordinance, granting special privileges to police superintendents and medical officers. This ordinance is based on Section 2 of the Emergency Ordinance of 1922, repealing Items (4) and (5) of Section 34 of the Emergency Ordinance published in Hong Kong Government Notice No. 794 on October 12 of last year, and revising the following provisions: Item (4) stipulates that the Commissioner of Police or the Director of Medical Services may detain foreigners in any tent or place as stipulated in Item (2), and may move them to other tents or release them. The aforementioned commissioners or their subordinates may order the police to restrict movement or other behaviors. Item (5) stipulates that the Commissioner of Police, the Director of Medical Services, personnel authorized by them, and military police who have obtained this authorization may use force to arrest and detain any persons deemed to be foreigners subject to this ordinance when necessary, and may transport such persons to tents or places established in accordance with Item (2).

Hong Kong Naval Defense Emergency Order. Furthermore, the Hong Kong Naval Defense Ordinance has been announced and implemented by the Hong Kong government. According to the gazette published yesterday morning, the British Emperor, based on the Colonial Naval Defense Act of 1931 and the Hong Kong Naval Volunteer Force Ordinance, issued the Hong Kong Naval Defense Order (1931). The order stipulates: (1) Hong Kong may provide for and deploy warships at its own expense; (2) The Admiralty may accept warships provided by the Hong Kong government at its own expense. If the warships are jointly provided by other colonies, the latter's consent is also required; (3) Officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Force (A) must comply with the regulations temporarily implemented to enforce naval discipline, whether serving at sea or on land, within or outside Hong Kong, as well as amended laws suitable for the Hong Kong environment; (B) They may be sent outside Hong Kong to serve and train on any warship or in other agencies or locations; (C) In times of emergency, they shall be incorporated into the naval service, and shall be designated as naval reserves, naval volunteer reserves, or a portion as naval reserves and a portion as naval volunteer reserves; (4) The Admiralty may accept officers and soldiers sent by the Hong Kong government to serve in the navy.

Five Hundred Boy Scouts Trained in Air Defense. In addition, the local air defense authorities are actively training citizens to participate in air defense work. Recently, they also plan to train five hundred boy scouts to provide them with air defense training, so that they can undertake communication work when telephone lines are damaged during wartime, such as reporting bombing situations and population casualties to the nearest air defense monitoring posts for assistance. In addition, the Hong Kong Cyclists' Association has offered its services to the Air Defense Association, dispatching qualified members to undertake communication work during air raids. The Air Defense Association has highly praised this.

### Prisoners in Various Prisons Forced to Perform Labor, More Than Two Hundred Convicts Sent to Labor

The local authorities in Hong Kong, in view of the sharp increase in the number of prisoners, had planned to dispatch prisoners sentenced to hard labor to participate in government engineering work. It has been found that part of this plan has been implemented, with a total of 250 prisoners being dispatched to perform labor. The work is designated by prison officials. Every morning, sixty-one people are sent out from Stanley Prison to work, repairing dikes near Stanley Prison and building a small-scale swimming pool on Stanley Beach for prison staff to use for sea bathing when summer arrives. Another group is sent to the city to repair roads and clean firearms for prison staff. There are also thirty such convict laborers working in Xiwang near Repulse Bay, and twenty in Tai Tam Tuk.

### Labor Officer Batter, Determined to Improve Workers' Lives, Has Inspected More Than Eight Hundred Factories in Recent Months, Has Submitted Inspection Results to the Hong Kong Government for Improvement

In order to improve the lives of workers, the Hong Kong government specially established a Labor Office in December last year, attached to the Secretariat for Chinese Affairs, and appointed former magistrate Batter as the first director. Since taking office, Batter has worked diligently, inspecting large and small factories throughout Hong Kong in the past few months, and conducting detailed research on the living conditions of workers. To date, more than 850 factories have been inspected. In addition to factories, Batter has also gone to the New Territories to inspect various mines and investigate the lives of miners. Recently, Batter has classified and reported in detail to the government the findings of the investigations over the past few months, and has submitted a plan to improve the lives of workers. Batter also has detailed reports and suggestions on the lives of child laborers. It is believed that the Hong Kong government will use this as the basis for improving the lives of workers in the future. This is also good news for Hong Kong workers. In addition, Batter has been diligently investigating factories and miners in various districts in the past few days, and has also arbitrated labor-management disputes, with remarkable results. In particular, the labor-management dispute at the Chung Hwa Book Company relied on Batter's efforts.

### A Rainstorm Suddenly Hit Hong Kong Yesterday, Two Children Drowned When a Boat Capsized at Sea, Dark Clouds Layered, Heavy Rain Flying Horizontally, the Whole of Hong Kong Suddenly Plunged into a Dark World, Many Small Boats in Yau Ma Tei and Cheung Sha Wan Were Blown Over, Resulting in Significant Losses

At 9:40 yesterday morning, a rainstorm suddenly struck Hong Kong. Dark clouds layered, and heavy rain flew horizontally. In an instant, the whole of Hong Kong was plunged into darkness. Districts in Kowloon such as Kowloon Tong and 花園角 (Flower Garden Corner) were as dark as night. Although the headlights of cars were turned on, they still had to drive slowly. The same scene appeared in North Point and Sai Wan in Hong Kong. Merchants turned on electric lights, and the red light signs and electric lights in the display windows of stores in the Central District were also turned on, creating a scene no different from nighttime. The wind and rain yesterday morning came so suddenly that people were caught off guard. According to the records of the Hong Kong Observatory's anemometer, the wind speed reached 50 miles per hour. Fortunately, it passed quickly, otherwise Hong Kong would have suffered major losses.

Boat Capsizes, People Drown, Two Children Die

It was found that at that time, the sea was in great turmoil, with towering waves. Ship traffic was suspended for tens of minutes. According to investigations after the event, two sampans at sea were unable to escape in time due to the sudden wind and rain and were destroyed by the strong winds. It is believed that many ships outside the port encountered danger or misfortune. More than ten small boats in the Yau Ma Tei typhoon shelter suddenly capsized. Many boat people were blown into the sea by the wind. Fortunately, they were rescued by neighboring boats, avoiding drowning. However, Zheng's brother and sister from boat No. 2828 drowned because they were young and weak. It was found that the boat owner, Zheng Shui, lived on the boat with his mother, Guo, his younger sister, Zheng Di, his wife, and two children. That morning, Zheng went ashore for business, leaving only his mother, sister, wife, and children on the boat. Unexpectedly, they were capsized by the strong wind and rain, and everyone sank into the water at the same time. Zheng's eldest daughter, Ah Su (8 years old), and youngest son, Ya Fu (6 years old), floated on the surface of the water, drinking seawater. Later, a ferry sailor from Yau Ma Tei bravely jumped down to rescue them. However, when they were rescued, the two children had already stopped breathing. Although the people on the ferry tried all kinds of treatments, they could not be revived. The ferry then sailed to Hong Kong and immediately carried the bodies of the two children to the pier after docking. The marine police then used a black box to carry them back to the Tsim Sha Tsui Marine Police Station for filing, and then transferred them to the Peninsula Mortuary for autopsy.

Many Ships at Sea Encountered Danger. It was also found that during the strong wind and rain yesterday morning, a 金星 (Golden Star) boat and four sampans on the sea off Sham Shui Po and Cheung Sha Wan were also blown over. Fortunately, most of the people on the boats were men and knew how to swim, so they were able to escape from danger calmly after the accident, and there were no deaths. However, all the belongings on the boats had mostly sunk into the sea without a trace, and the losses were not small. It was found that the reason why more than ten boats were blown over was that the boat people took the boat as their home, and all their clothes and belongings were stored in the boat. Now that they have suddenly capsized, most of them were washed away by the waves and sunk to the bottom of the sea. The total loss is estimated to be two or three thousand yuan. According to experienced boat people, the sudden and violent nature of this rainstorm suggests that many ships at sea must have encountered danger. Although 海艦 (sea-going ships) have been rampant recently, the number of cargo ships traveling between Hong Kong and Macau and fishing boats going out to sea is still not small. It is difficult to avoid danger when suddenly encountering such a treacherous storm while sailing. According to the Hong Kong Observatory's weather report, such rainstorms are rare. The weather will be sunny this week, no longer cloudy, and there will be occasional sunshine. (From 7:00 AM this morning (yesterday) to 11:00 AM, the heavy rain yielded a total of 5.4 inches of water.)

Hong Kong Observatory's Gale Signal Locations Yesterday Morning. The newspaper published a notice from the Hong Kong Observatory, stating that in the future, when issuing Hurricane Warning Signals No. 5 to No. 10, residents should not call the observatory to inquire about news, because the observatory staff will be very busy during this time. Various signals will be displayed at the following locations: Hong Kong Observatory, Kowloon Signal Hill, 九飛碼頭 (Nine Flying Wharf), 黄捕船廠 (Huang Pu Shipyard), Marine Department, Teng Ma warship, Guizhou, Lai Chi Kok, Lei Yue Mun, Gough Hill Police Station, Star Ferry Pier (Notice Board), General Post Office (Notice Board), and Kowloon Tong. In addition, the Hong Kong Telephone Company has set up a weather warning service center.

### Chaozhou Association Invites Xia Yan to Give a Lecture on the Current New Situation in Chaozhou and Shantou

The Hong Kong Chaozhou Association is organized by cultural figures from Chaozhou and Shantou. Since its establishment, the association's affairs have been thriving. It is heard that it has been approved for registration by the British government. In order to enhance the strength of protecting Great Chaozhou and Shantou, it recently held a current affairs symposium and invited Mr. Xia Yan, the president of the Save-the-Nation Daily News, who has returned from an inspection of Chaozhou and Shantou, to give a lecture on the topic of "The Current New Situation in Chaozhou and Shantou." The time is 2:00 PM on April 16 (Sunday), and the location is 礐光 Middle School, Yinghui Terrace, Zhao Dao. The discussion is open to the public.

### Brigandage Rampant, Eighteen Cases of Robbery on Land and Sea Occurred in the Last Twenty Days, More Than One Hundred Bandits in Total, Only Seven People Arrested, Sixty-Two Firearms Seized, More Than Six Thousand Dollars in Property Robbed

Recently, land and sea have been uneasy, and robbery cases have been frequent. Although the police authorities are making every effort to pursue the criminals, the bandits are as rampant as ever. According to investigations, in the last twenty days, from March 27 to April 13, as many as eighteen robbery cases occurred in the rivers of Kowloon and the New Territories. The number of bandits in the cases reached one hundred, and only seven people were arrested. The rest have disappeared without a trace. According to statistics, the above-mentioned robbery cases involved 101 bandits, 62 long and short firearms, and 5 sharp swords and blades. The property robbed amounted to 6,215 yuan and eight jiao. Among them, there was one tragic case that occurred on the sea off Lintangwei. A boatman, Liang Hong, was injured by 15 pirates armed with firearms, and 140 yuan was robbed. The largest loss occurred when a cargo ship on the sea off Jiuzhendao was looted by ten bandits, with 2,800 yuan being robbed. The second largest was the Hua'an Gold Shop on Shanghai Street in Mong Kok, with jewelry worth 1,667 yuan being robbed.

Two More Gun Theft Cases in the Peninsula

In addition, in the past two days, two robbery cases occurred in Mong Kok and Nathan Road within nine hours. It was found that a major theft case occurred in a Westerner's residence in Gan Jiao. Between 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM yesterday morning, an unknown method was used to steal a jewelry box containing valuable jewelry worth 645 yuan. The owner went to the police station yesterday morning to report the case and asked them to investigate the whereabouts of the bandits. Secondly, a young lady was walking near Dundas Street, Nathan Road, Yau Ma Tei at 8:00 PM the night before when she was suddenly robbed of her handbag by a man in his early twenties who had been tailing her. After succeeding, he ran away. The bag contained a ladies' fountain pen worth two yuan, a pair of sunglasses worth two yuan, twenty yuan in Shanghai paper money, one ten-yuan Hong Kong bill, five one-yuan bills, a powder box, and a lipstick, totaling thirty-three yuan. It was found that the young lady's name is Zhang Lili.

The Situation is Treacherous, Insurance Premiums for Goods Shipped from Hong Kong to Europe Increase Sharply Again, Doubling the Original Price

In recent years, due to the unstable situation in Europe, insurance premiums for goods shipped from Hong Kong to various parts of Europe have repeatedly increased. Yesterday, the premiums increased again, with the newly set premiums doubling the original price. However, the British government's subsidies have made it possible to maintain reasonable insurance rates for cargo transportation between Britain and Hong Kong. The British government's subsidies to British insurance companies are actually a manifestation of safeguarding British cargo transportation. It is believed that British insurers will be able to cooperate with the government. The increase in premiums is limited to shipping cargo on merchant ships in the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas.

### Manufacturers' Delegation Returns to Hong Kong, Three Days in Macau

— Jing Nan

Ye Lanquan Talks About the Gains of This Trip

Feature

The Hong Kong Manufacturers' Macau Inspection Delegation, after inspecting Macau for three days, bid farewell yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to the destination for future industrial development. The departure was amidst wind and rain, symbolizing the fate of the Chinese nation, shaking the hearts of every member of the delegation.

The inspection delegation spent three days attending two banquets, three tea parties, and visiting more than five local government officials and overseas Chinese leaders. This short three days is certainly not enough to survey factory sites, inspect general conditions, and establish overseas Chinese national capital. However, this move by the inspection delegation has two facts that have clearly unfolded before everyone, demanding our attention: First, the issue of overseas Chinese investment in the motherland's industry after the war; second, the issue of developing rear-area production and enhancing resistance strength during the war. However, let's just briefly mention these two issues here, and I will talk about the gains of the three-day inspection.

On the return voyage, many people congratulated the delegation leader, Mr. Ye Lanquan. The success of his leadership this time, at the very least, has two points worth mentioning: (1) further strengthening the unity of the Hong Kong and Macau compatriots; (2) the good spirit of the delegation members made friendly countries recognize the greatness and progress of the Chinese nation. These two points are what the old inspection delegation said about the views of the Macau compatriots and the Portuguese. It also did two other good things: one was donating hundreds of yuan to the refugees in the Macau refugee camp, and the second was donating 500 yuan to the 無原 工藝學校 (Orphanage Technical School) to build a "Hong Kong Manufacturers' Inspection Delegation Memorial Hall." As for whether the original purpose of this trip has been fully achieved, although it is not yet possible to fully determine, I have heard that a glass factory and a sulfuric acid factory have decided to set up in Macau. These two factories were embraced because Guangzhou fell.

Chairman Ye said on the ship about his impressions of this trip, "The Macau government welcomes our investment. I think 仔 (Taipa) is a suitable place to set up a factory, but the most important issue still needs to wait a week before all the matters can be decided. This is the issue of buying land, because legally buying land in Macau requires registration by a Portuguese person. Now, Mr. Liang Houyuan says that this legal procedure no longer exists. Even so, we still need to wait for Mr. Liang to draw up the land drawings for us to see in a week before making a decision. We ourselves also need to wait for each factory to report the opinions they have obtained."

The Macau government has expressed its best efforts to provide various conveniences to the manufacturers' requests, such as reducing water and electricity fees, and the restrictions on the age and working hours of workers. These can be said to be the definite restrictions that the inspection delegation knows about. There are only a few conditions for setting up a factory there, and many members of the delegation may already have good ideas in mind for inspection. Among the members, one who has expertise and experience in setting up factories proposed the following points, which I will write down as the ending of this article as a reference for everyone: The conditions required for a place to be a central area for industrial implementation are roughly as follows: (1) raw materials are easily obtained, (2) close to the market, (3) convenient transportation, (4) availability of manpower, (5) other general conveniences for setting up a factory.

### A Jubilant Hong Kong Weekend

— Yu Lang

Saturday afternoon has arrived. The air in the city center, "Victoria City," is thick with tension.

Clerks, both big and small, in foreign firms, government offices, and banks are busy finishing up their work and "getting off work."

The factories' "blood-guzzling mouths" of gates also open, spewing out thousands of exhausted laborers.

School students, both boys and girls, hop around like sparrows, carrying their schoolbags home, filled with boundless joy as they enjoy a day and a half of vacation.

On the roads, traffic is particularly dense, with cars, buses, and trams forming strings, coming and going, interwoven. Clerks, workers, students, men, women, like a tide, surge to and fro, all revealing hurried attitudes, running along with urgent steps.

In the splendid restaurants, wealthy merchants, tycoons, compradores, senior officials, and high-class refugees fill the seats. Ordinary teahouses and dining rooms are also packed with clerks, workers, and students. Some leisurely enjoy a more substantial lunch, because today is Saturday, and there is no need to work in the afternoon, no need to rush. Others eat even more hastily, more "carelessly," because today is Saturday afternoon, there is no need to work, but they are in a hurry to find entertainment, to seek amusement.

It's almost 2:30 PM. People are packed in front of the movie theaters. On the advertising posters, half-naked beauties, displaying full, snow-white thighs, beckon to gentlemen, wives, young ladies, and young masters.

The 2:30 PM, 5:15 PM, and 7:15 PM seats are all sold out, and the 9:30 PM ones will definitely be sold out too. "Seats are Full" signs hang all over every box office of every theater.

The "Special Horse Races," held once every week, naturally attract a considerable number of citizens looking for weekend entertainment.

In Happy Valley, there are thousands of wealthy merchants and tycoons, thousands of Chinese and foreign gentlemen, high-class refugees, and even ordinary citizens who are unwilling to pass up a chance at fortune. They also come to the racecourse to gamble on luck with the wealthy. They are not just seeking entertainment, they are seeking enjoyment, and even hoping to get rich. Money leads the horses, the horses lead the people, chasing, chasing, everyone is chasing after money.

Not far from the racecourse is the football field. Speaking of football, everyone knows how the "fans" feel about football. For the wealthy, spending a few dollars is nothing. But there are also many ordinary fans who sell a set of clothes to buy a ticket to "watch the game." It is said that a certain market vendor, both father and son being fans, would not "open their stall" whenever there was a football match, even skipping business to watch the game.

Since local fans are so enthusiastic, the soccer teams that came to seek refuge are not to be outdone. The degree of their "obsession" is not low, so every weekend football match is packed with people. Before 3 PM, Happy Valley or Caroline Hill is surrounded, not a drop of water can leak through.

The tea dances from 5 PM to 7 PM are of course a lively affair on Saturdays, and young gentlemen will not miss them. The tempting, exciting jazz music has long intoxicated this group of city children on the dance floor.

7 PM arrives, and the black curtain of night envelops Hong Kong Island. "The devil's sunshine"—the lights and neon tubes!—release gentle, seductive, and stimulating rays, the time for finding happiness has arrived, and the prelude to nightlife is played loudly by jazz bands.

Restaurants and dining rooms are even more lively than at noon. The more popular "mahjong games" also begin "battling" in every "hall" and club of every restaurant. The sound of mahjong tiles, "smack, smack, clatter, clatter," will not stop until 2 AM on Sunday morning.

The telephone lines of every restaurant and every hotel are connected to the telephone lines of every "tour guide agency." The small rooms in hotels and the curtained booths in restaurants are all places where female tour guides "guide" guests on "tours."

The gaudily dressed tour guide girls are busy with the incessantly ringing telephones.

After 8 PM, the dance halls become tense again. The elastic girls who sell their waists and thighs all know that Saturday evenings are particularly busy, and everyone wants to get more dance tickets, sit at more tables, more…

In several quiet corners of the city, under the dim light of the streetlamps, maids dressed in black are busy accompanying goddesses dressed in colorful clothes and thick makeup to do their pitiful deeds.

Goddesses are the pitiful daughters of the city. Among them, there are even girls as young as thirteen or fourteen!

I remember not long ago, when the "Salvation Army" held its annual meeting, when discussing the issue of "child prostitution," the chairman made this conclusion: "They simply have no choice other than prostitution or starvation…!"

The corruption of nightlife also erodes the lives of laborers—

On Saturday nights, mahjong parlors are particularly prosperous. These lower-class parlors are mostly ordinary shops, inside which are placed ten or eight square tables, each with an electric light. Mahjong tiles or "tien gow" cards are placed on the tables. Anyone can go in to "play cards" as long as you pay a certain handling fee. This fee is a percentage taken from the "stakes" of the gambling, called "drawing water." If you don't have four people, their "staff" can join in to make up the numbers.

They play mahjong with "scattered calculations"—"earth banker"—even if you only have twenty cents, you can go in and shuffle a few "hands." If you lose, you can run away; if you win, you can keep playing. Because of this, even people with very low incomes are attracted and lose everything.

Gambling is probably the only entertainment for the lower classes (?). They gamble head-over-heels until dawn.

Businesses parasitic on gambling, like small coffee shops, small ice rooms, "cigarette stalls," "red pill halls," lower-class private prostitute dens… are also prospering and crowded.

Perhaps the five-and-a-half days of mechanical life have numbed their weariness (?). Weekends in Hong Kong are times of wild joy and decadence. Once Saturday afternoon arrives, everyone forgets everything, forgets the war, forgets themselves, forgets others, indulging in joy and reveling in it. Until the early morning of Sunday arrives.

Many people don't get out of bed until noon on Sunday.

### Ours

— Jin Shan

—— Regarding the China Salvation Drama Troupe ——

For the past twenty months, we have been engaged in dramatic work in rural war zones. This has made us deeply aware that, in order for drama to have a significant impact on the war of resistance, it must be closely linked to real life. The bloody reality has taught everyone, and naturally every drama worker, that to progress and grow, one must dissolve oneself into the war of resistance. We are faced with only two paths: growth or annihilation. Trying to be clever in between will inevitably be discarded by the times.

In fact, this is not unique to drama; it applies to all work.

In August of the year before last (1937), we departed from Shanghai, passing through the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong… We saw many aspects of the situation in the war. These situations told us that everything is in motion, every worker in every department, every civilian, is moving forward, is doing their utmost to contribute to the war of resistance. China is accelerating its progress, accelerating its growth.

All the phenomena of the twenty-month war of resistance have given us a firm conviction, guaranteeing our certain victory in the future. This is an immutable truth, not to be doubted in the slightest by anyone. We should grasp this truth and intensify our struggle!

Chairman Chiang, in the Nanyue Conference, pointed out the current stage of the second phase of the war of resistance: "Politics is more important than military affairs," "Propaganda is more important than combat." This fully demonstrates the importance of cultural work. We, who are engaged in cultural work, should take this instruction as our guide, follow in the footsteps of those who have gone before us, and strive to work diligently.

Now, we are about to conclude our twenty months of work in China and head abroad to complete another mission: to conduct a more widespread and concrete propaganda campaign among overseas Chinese regarding the heroic achievements of our army since the war of resistance, the great strength displayed by all sectors in the war of resistance, the situation of military-civilian cooperation, and the military and political progress. This aims to consolidate the overseas Chinese' confidence in victory in the war of resistance, enhance their enthusiasm for the war of resistance, and expand the overseas Chinese salvation movement, so that those with strength contribute strength, and those with money contribute money; to expose and destroy the acts of cultural and religious destruction, indiscriminate bombing, the use of poison gas, and the endangerment of foreign nationals. And to expose the ambition of the × warlords to annex China, monopolize the Far East market, and exclude the economic interests of various countries in China, the barbaric act of violating international conventions, the conspiracy to provoke world peace, and the fact of their gradual decline, and to explain the reasons why they will ultimately be defeated by the new China, in order to promote more practical assistance from the international community. At the same time, to raise 500,000 yuan in donations to establish ten wounded soldier reception stations, five wounded soldier hospitals, one general station for wartime cultural supplies, ten branch stations, and to establish ten vocational training centers for disabled soldiers and the families of martyrs, in order to partially solve the urgent problems we saw while working in the war zone. This task is indeed quite arduous. But we are willing to make our best efforts to complete it. The more effort we put in, the more joy we have, and the more small contributions we make to the motherland in the war of resistance. However, this contribution must be accomplished with the help of our beloved overseas Chinese. We firmly believe that overseas Chinese will give us great help in our work!

We come from the flames of war, and we can never forget the brothers and sisters of our motherland who are struggling hard. We plan to complete this task quickly and return to our motherland quickly, return to the front lines, and participate in the final decisive battle with our heroic brothers! (April 10th at the Salvation Society)

### On Stage Techniques

— Lu Dun

Eightfold Tone and Punctuation

The life of a spoken drama lies in the dialogue. It is the duty of the actor to control and manipulate the audience's emotions by reading the lines in a pleasing manner. This, of course, is achieved through the skillful use of intonation and cadence. But how should intonation and cadence be used? This requires much study.

The main purpose of an actor's recitation is to fully express the meaning of each line, which is related to intonation. However, the use of intonation is not only about expressing the meaning of the words, but mainly about conveying emotions.

The use of intonation in words and sentences depends not only on the rhymes of the words, but also on finding the places in the sentence that should be emphasized, which is called "stress." The location of the stress is often the central point of a sentence. For example, in the sentence: "Zhang San was killed," the stress is on the word "killed," because this word is the most important meaning in the whole sentence, and it must be expressed slightly exaggeratedly. It is from this stress that the intonation of the sentence is determined.

At the same time, an error in the stress can often cause the same sentence to have different meanings. For example, "What are you doing?" Only these few words, but if the position of the stress is different, it can have different effects: if the stress is on "what," the meaning is "You once told me you were doing something, but what exactly is it?" If the stress is on "are," it becomes "What are you doing right now?" If the stress is on "you," it has a bit of a scolding tone. If the stress is on "doing," it becomes "We have already heard your opinion, but what have you really done?" If the emphasis is not on any one word, then the whole sentence is important and becomes a tone of request.

Therefore, to accurately express the meaning of dialogue, appropriate stress is necessary. Incorrect stress can distort the author's original intention. To solve the difficulties in stress, actors must study in advance when reading the lines, find the location of the stress, and then practice it.

A passage of dialogue is mostly composed of several sentences, so attention must be paid to the division of sentences.

In those passages of dialogue composed of several sentences, first look at the punctuation of each sentence. Ordinary commas require a slight pause, colons and semicolons can pause a little longer, but this is not fixed, and must be determined by the momentum and emotions; but the shortest pause between sentences is very important, because this is where the expression lies. Some actors often pause too long in these places, and the duration of each pause is average, which is not good, because then there is no rhythm of fast and slow. Sometimes, a long passage of dialogue, although divided into several sentences, can often achieve an effect by reciting it in one breath without pausing, which is most often used in comedy.

However, the so-called reciting in one breath without pausing does not mean that there is no pause at all between sentences, but that the pause is very short, and the tone of voice is used as punctuation, so that the audience can understand and distinguish the sentences one by one.

An incorrect division of sentences can often cause sentences to have different meanings. A common saying can be used as an example, such as "Road not passable, no urinating here." The place to divide the sentence is the word "passable," when reciting, the pause is after the word "passable." But if the place to pause is mistaken when reciting, and it is recited as: "Road not passable, cannot pass, urinate here," then the meaning of the whole sentence is completely reversed. Therefore, the place to divide and pause the sentence when reciting should be paid special attention to. Sometimes, even if it is a very long sentence, if there is no pause sign in the middle, then do not pause randomly in the middle, but must recite it in one breath. For the sake of expression, you can only emphasize the stress, or lengthen the sound of one or two words - but you cannot stop completely.

Some actors often recite every two words in a sentence like they are giving a speech, which not only lacks emotion, but is also unnatural, unlike speaking, and is very annoying to listen to.

In short, reciting lines is the main homework for actors, and much practice is necessary. (To be continued)

### A Quick Sketch of the Youth Drama Association's Welcome Meeting for the China Salvation Drama Troupe

— Zhu Baishui

Comrades, let us join hands closely in our work!

This is an unforgettable joyous gathering for Hong Kong youth drama workers!

In order to welcome our warriors, to welcome the comrades who have been fighting in the flames of war in the motherland for nineteen months, the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association initiated a welcome meeting for the "China Salvation Drama Troupe" by all the youth drama groups in Hong Kong.

The groups that attended included the Hongbai Drama Troupe, the Xinsheng Drama Society, the LuFeng Drama Society, the Gong Drama Society, the Honglan Drama Troupe, the Rendou Drama Troupe, the Amateur Drama Troupe, the Tiemo Drama Troupe, the Ant Children's Drama Troupe, the Pioneer Children's Drama Troupe, the Qingnian Tongle Society, the Dingchou Drama Society, the Cyclone Drama Society, the Xuede Lizhi Society, the Zhonghua Bookstore Drama Troupe, the Huiqing Drama Group, the Propaganda Training Class Drama Group, the Youth Corps, the Guangda Drama Society, and the XueZhen Western District Drama Group, with a total of three or four hundred comrades, a record-breaking joyous gathering for Hong Kong drama workers.

The auditorium of South China Middle School was crowded and joyful. Everyone was intertwined with excitement and enthusiasm. Everyone was eagerly awaiting the arrival of the distinguished guests, with a deep sense of reverence and heroic admiration in their hearts!

Finally, amidst warm applause and standing ovations, our heroic warriors - the comrades of the China Salvation Drama Troupe, a group of more than twenty people, appeared at our grand meeting.

An extreme excitement and fervent emotion floated among us—

The young chairman wearing glasses stood up and gave a concise opening speech, followed by Mr. Lu Fu, who gave a detailed report and introduction to the growth and struggle of the "China Salvation Drama Troupe," allowing everyone to understand more deeply and clearly the history and achievements of these warriors.

What a rush of rapid and enthusiastic applause this was! Our heroic pioneers, the distinguished guests of tonight, Mr. Jin Shan, stood tall before us in a heroic posture.

Filled with excitement and solemnity, yet burning with passion and joy, with a loud and moving tone, like an actor on stage, like a warrior on the battlefield, he began his speech—

First, he reported that they started working in the interior from the organization of the Shanghai Salvation Drama Propaganda Second Team after the start of the August 13th War of Resistance, and successively passed through Suzhou, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Hankou, Shangcheng, Macheng, and then went south along the Yuehan Railway, transferring to Hunan and entering Guangxi. During the nineteen months, they lived like soldiers and farmers. During the course of their work, they understood and firmly believed that China was saveable, and that China's war of resistance would achieve final victory!

He pointed out the determination and heroism, perseverance and composure of the political work youth and drama work youth in the vast war zone. Therefore, he emphasized: What is needed now is not "movie stars," but youth salvation workers who participate in the war of resistance!

—A burst of warm applause made everyone more invigorated to look up to him.

Because those who attended this evening were all young workers engaged in the anti-Japanese drama movement, he specifically pointed out the power and effect of drama in the war of resistance, and used four or five examples of work reports to illustrate it.

He reported in detail how drama was used to move and explain to a big landlord who killed without batting an eye to participate in the war of resistance, to mobilize the masses to participate in the guerrilla team, and to transform children who were acting as local guides for the Japanese and real traitors. These are all valuable experiences and moving deeds.

Then he resolutely said that the content of drama at the current stage should be realistic, vivid, rich, emotional, with flesh and blood, without emptiness or illusion, completely expressed in real life. True art represents the soul of the country, and new art is born in the national revolution!

"Why is salvation drama developing so vigorously and widely? How are each of the young workers engaged in salvation drama fighting in the motherland…?" Mr. Jin Shan asked powerfully, and everyone silently and solemnly looked up at him: "Each worker has a high degree of enthusiasm and a deep political understanding. In addition to busy work and a small amount of sleep, everyone is immersed in studying the development of the war of resistance situation and the changes in international politics. Their lives are absolutely popularized, without wastefulness or decadence, and they are integrated with farmers and soldiers. The content of the work is the most realistic, without any empty thoughts, and the workers in the war zone are absolutely united without any friction!"

He eloquently struck the hearts of everyone with a powerful tone, waving his solid fist in a dramatic pose. Finally, he strongly declared:

"Only unity can exert the greatest strength. At present, it is necessary for a large number of young workers to go to the interior to mobilize the masses to participate in the national war of resistance, to go to the war zones, and to go to the countryside to learn. Soldiers, farmers, and workers are our best learners!

The heroic posture of the warriors tempered in the great national revolutionary war of resistance is unforgettable for everyone. Mr. Jin Shan moved everyone in this way.

Mr. Wang Ying then stood in front of us. She smiled, she was strong, she was dignified, she began to report the work process of their team. The work was heavy and busy, but the life was arduous and persevering. They lived in civilian houses and temples, and ate the same food as the soldiers and farmers. They have performed more than seven hundred times, and have never sold tickets for their own group.

Mr. Wang reported the experience of the work in detail. Finally, she said with composure: Arm our spirit, and make a strong struggle in our own work position!

Again, there was a burst of rapid and enthusiastic applause. Mr. Mo Shu followed Mr. Wang Ying's concluding remarks and stood up. Mr. Lin is a person with extremely rich political and military cultivation. Therefore, he started by taking Jingwei's "give an example" to severely criticize it, and very correctly analyzed the death of Zeng Shi, and Wang Jingwei's traitorous country, saying it happily and vividly, making everyone feel very angry.

Mr. Lin also correctly used numerical statistics to confirm the losses of the × people in the war. This loss is causing the × people to move towards collapse and failure! China's war of resistance is to strive for a comprehensive victory, not a struggle for one point or one line. As long as every citizen of the Republic of China is a heroic fighter, then the final victory is ours!

Fan Zheng, the only young warrior of the China Salvation Drama Troupe, stood firmly on the stage with his chin as Mr. Lin introduced him amidst the long and warm applause.

He is no more than thirteen years old at most. He escaped tragically after the fall of the Northeast. However, he did not want to be a small slave or a small refugee. He wanted revenge, he wanted to fight, so he grew up heroically in the flames of war in the motherland.

He reported the posture of the children's drama groups fighting in the motherland, such as the New An Travel Troupe, the Children's Drama Troupe, and the Xiamen Children's Salvation Drama Troupe, etc. Finally, he described the heroic work of killing × by the Anhui Anti-Japanese Children's Corps, which was so moving!

Finally, there was also a speech by educator Fang Xingrang, who participated in the grand meeting. Mr. Jin Shan also earnestly hoped that the Hong Kong drama movement would strengthen its work and unite!

Under the strong light, everyone's face was shining. No, it was excited and very red. The oranges, peanuts and biscuits on the table had long been exploited and turned into residual dregs. We are intertwined in excitement, laughter, and fun.

Interesting after-dinner entertainment intensified everyone's enthusiasm and excitement. Wang Ying's "Lugou Bridge", Fan Zheng's "Wang Jingwei", Zhu Guoping's "Children's Pioneer Song", the Salvation Drama Troupe's "We Are Young Drama Team Members", the Ant Drama Troupe's "Sing the Eight Hundred Brave Soldiers"...

In the chorus of "March of the Volunteers", everyone's heart was burning with fervent hope - the motherland is embarking on a victorious future in the struggle!

### A Few Points to Note When Criticizing Movies

— Bai Xue

With the advent of movies, criticism inevitably follows. Every viewer of a film, and even those who haven't seen it, are often critical of movies, regardless of their critical attitude. The most easily noticed are film reviews that are written and published. Everyone can criticize movies, but few can make appropriate and fitting criticisms. Many can write film reviews, but few are of value. This article is truly a "critique of critiques," merely outlining a few points to keep in mind when criticizing movies:

First, if you want to criticize a film, you must have seen it.

——This point may seem like a joke, but in fact, it is the first essential step in criticizing a movie. For example, the film reviews that appear in several well-known Hong Kong newspapers on the day a film is released are mostly written without having seen the film. The authors mostly refer to criticisms from foreign newspapers and magazines, translate them, and then add their own predicted opinions to write the film review. In fact, it is not entirely appropriate to call this kind of writing "film review"; it is best to call it "movie-watching guide" or "new film introduction." But many of these articles have reference value, and writing them may even be more laborious than writing a review after seeing the film. However, because it is a prediction before seeing the film, or taking someone else's criticism as one's own, errors are inevitable. Furthermore, very few people criticize Cantonese films in general. Criticizing something requires that thing to have value worth criticizing. But even the worst thing has its own value to be criticized; the worse it is, the more it needs accurate criticism to correct it. The reason why Cantonese films lack criticism is not in their inherent value, but because "to criticize a film, you must have seen it," and those with the ability to criticize rarely have the energy to do the "watching" work.

Second, if you want to criticize a movie, you must understand movies.

——One often hears, "He doesn't understand at all; what is he criticizing?" In fact, there are few movie experts, but many movie critics. Among them, some pretend to know what they don't, but most base their arguments on what they do understand. Those who understand little make superficial criticisms. Those who understand more make specialized criticisms. Generally speaking, most people can easily understand whether the actors' performances are good or bad, or whether the story is good or bad. As for the use of techniques and the creation of atmosphere, although the audience is affected, most people do not understand them. Therefore, the former is often criticized, while the latter is rarely criticized. The reason is that they know what happens, but not why. "A money-making film is not necessarily good, and a good film does not necessarily make money." On the one hand, this is caused by the "determinism" of film merchants. (Merchants guess that a certain type of film is too popular based on audience psychology, so they reduce publicity and release it on "cold" days, which is not necessarily the case.) On the other hand, it is also because the good points of good films cannot be "understood" by the audience. For example, the main audience of Cantonese films in general—aunties, older sisters, female workers, wives—and the general audience that is considered low-class, do they understand movies? No.　Do they not have criticisms? They do. Perhaps they can criticize a certain "folk tale" film for having the wrong story, precisely because they　have seen the "folk tale" wood-fish book, which enables them to understand that the "folk tale" film failed to capture the essence of the wood-fish book. And precisely because they do not, or cannot, make deeper distinctions and criticisms, they are able to be interested in Cantonese films in general. This range of "understanding" is very broad. From a film's subject matter, actors, director, sets, and even the smallest props, to the workers' attitudes, past achievements, technical applications, and other aspects, the more one understands, the more common sense and specialized knowledge one has, the more grounded the criticism will be, and the more valuable the criticism itself will be. Many Chinese film reviews do not truly understand films, and have never produced authoritative film critics. Of course, there are other reasons, but the main one is whether they "understand" enough.

Third, movie criticism should be unbiased, not generalized, and not blinded by publicity.

Movie criticism must not be blinded by publicity. Critics　are inherently individuals, and ultimately cannot avoid "what I think," but the attitude of criticism must be relatively objective and serious, and must not be biased. Criticizing good or bad based on personal preferences. For example, I like a certain star, I like a certain type of film, that film is the work of a great director, or someone is incorrigible. These can only be used as references for criticism, not as the basis for criticism. Famous directors often have undesirable works, and minor actors often have remarkable performances. Movie criticism cannot be generalized:　for example, Chinese movies are not as good as foreign movies, but one cannot write off Chinese movies as hopeless. Although the United States has good movies, Hollywood is really quite inept; money has created everything. Their limited success is not enough to compensate for their vast consumption. The best products account for no more than 20 percent. Chinese films are indeed far behind, but the little achievement of Chinese films has been struggled out of poverty and hardship. The capital is small, the machinery is outdated, and its achievement can be said to have already exceeded consumption. The funds for one great Hollywood production are almost enough to buy up all the Chinese film companies with plenty to spare. If one criticizes the productions of these two countries, of course one cannot use the same perspective. "Generalization, for example, now the Shanghai production organization is able to produce valuable productions, or the Hong Kong film company is able to produce better films. Critics should give them high praise. Secondly, critics should have some ability to not be blinded by publicity policies. The publicity policies of modern movies are amazing. The best-selling movies are not necessarily the best movies, but often "sensational movies." The audience is often influenced by the sensationalism of publicity? And to see a movie, sensational movies are not necessarily good movies,　sometimes even affecting viewers' ability to distinguish, and they take it for granted that it is a good movie. These are the points that should be paid the most attention to when criticizing movies, and must never be affected by the mentality,　and people blindly follow what others say. For example, a certain costume drama is constantly exaggerating the grandeur of its sets,　which is not necessarily a bad thing, but if it is grand to the point of being inexplicable without any research, the critic should discriminate against it.

Fourth, movie criticism must have unique insights.

Whether criticizing the merits of a film from the meaning expressed in its content or the achievements in its techniques, the main thing is to have unique insights and be able to go deep in order to become a valuable criticism. Merely using a rote-learned style to criticize how the director's techniques are, whether the actors are experienced, whether the photography is beautiful, etc., is really not enough to express oneself. For example, if you can point out the shortcomings of a film, that is certainly good;　if you can further explain how to make up for this shortcoming, wouldn't that be even better?

The Drama Association Welcomes Xia Yan to a Symposium

To be Held at South China Middle School at 7 PM Tonight

The Hong Kong Youth Drama Association is a unified organization of more than 20 youth drama groups in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Its lively demeanor reveals the enthusiasm of youth, and also symbolizes the bright future of the drama movement. After warmly welcoming the China Salvation Drama Troupe, it is scheduled to hold a symposium to welcome Mr. Xia Yan, advisor to the association, at 7 PM today (the 16th), which will discuss "The Current Stage of the Chinese Drama Movement", "Playwriting", and "New Prospects for the Hong Kong Wartime Drama Movement". Mr. Cai Chusheng, Mr. Situ Huimin and other gentlemen will also be invited to participate in the discussion. There is sure to be a lively scene. It is heard that the association welcomes those who love drama to attend and participate.

The First Theater Troupe is Reborn

Officially Established on the 18th

The Guangdong Drama Association is a newly opened flower of drama in the South, composed of more than 20 drama groups in Guangzhou, with more than 500 members. Hu Chunbing, Zhao Rulin, Zhong Qinan, Luo Haisha, etc., are enthusiastic leaders of the association.

After the fall of Guangzhou, these more than 500 drama workers scattered to various places to work, some serving in the army. A part of the members who arrived in Hong Kong, in order to continue their work, formed the "Guangdong Drama Association Hong Kong Branch" at the end of last year, and continued to promote the development of the work with great effort in difficult times.

The new and concrete expression is the reorganization of the "First Theater Troupe," which was originally resolved by the Guangdong Drama Association's board of directors, under the leadership of the couple Hu Bingchun and Tang Shuming. This can be said to be a surge of heat in the drama movement.

Now the troupe's address has been selected, and the inauguration ceremony is scheduled to be held at 1 PM on Wednesday, the 18th of this month, so that work can be carried out quickly. It is said that the famous plays prepared for the first performance include Hu Chunbing's "Chinese Men," Xia Yan's "One Year," You Jing's "Shanghai Rooftop," "Lust Demon," "The Inspector General," and "The Great Thunderstorm," and other famous plays. Workers who have come out of the fire of war will surely do a good job. We extend our most sincere respect and wish them a rebirth and growth!

Children's Drama Association Established

Inauguration Ceremony on the Evening of the 17th

The Hong Kong Children's Drama Association is the highest unified organization of children's drama in Hong Kong. It is responsible for the two major missions of connecting the feelings of various troupes and promoting the development of the children's drama movement. After active preparations by children's drama troupes such as Ant, Pioneer, Qiangzhong, Central, Xue Zhen, and Youth Co-op, various items have been generally prepared. It has been decided to hold the inauguration ceremony at the Central Women's School on Portland Street at 7 PM on the 17th of this month. Due to environmental reasons, the "Long Live Children" grand performance, which has been postponed again and again, will also be able to meet the audience. According to the association's organization, under the general meeting, there is a board of directors and advisors. The standing directors are divided into five departments: (1) The general affairs department has documentation, finance, public relations, and affairs sections. (2) The organization department has transportation, friendship, investigation, registration, and other sections. (3) The theater affairs department has four officers. (4) The research department has editing, technology, seminars, library, and other sections. The publicity department has publishing, art, acrobatics, and singing sections. The new children's drama movement will surely have a surprising achievement in the near future.

"The Cry of Humanity"

An English Film Being Shot During the Day

The first English film "The Cry of Humanity," co-produced by International Company and Zhenguang Company, has been introduced in a short article in our previous issues. Now it is heard that the film will be shot in the coming days, because the production of English films is still a pioneering work. The participants in this work have always been known for their cautious production attitude, and the subject matter taken by the film, as well as any other aspect, is no less than a "giant film" type, so the preparation period has been particularly long. The most important thing is the compilation, staging, translation, and modification of the script, which has taken a long time. In the production of English films, there are also various difficulties that must be overcome in advance, and then the work on the set can be carried out. It is said that the staff of the film are: Luo Mingyou as the producer, Huang Guoyin as the production director, Zhong Shigen as the screenwriter, director　　, Li Minwei as the technical director, and Zhou Daming as the photographer; Pei Chong, Tu Hengfu, Fang Meichao, and Tong Zhenmin will collaborate on the theater affairs. The main actors are Zhang Yi, Li Zhuozhuo, Chen Yunshang, Wu Chufan, and Lu Dun. The film is based on the struggle between a large refugee group and aggressors, epidemics, and selfishness during the War of Resistance, showing the story of one person. It is heard that the director has decided to go to Fanling first to shoot scenes of refugee life. It is expected to take at least three or four months to complete!

Famous Play "Phoenix City"

Many Troupes Are Rehearsing

"Phoenix City" and "The Devil's Den" are the "twin masterpieces of drama" that emerged after the War of Resistance, but "Phoenix City" is more worth reading because it is a very mature script depicting the positive (The Devil's Den is mainly the negative) War of Resistance, and it puts the correct theory into popular language and has gone through a skilled process of imagery.

Phoenix City is a script by young playwright Wu Zuguang depicting Miao Kexiu's heroic actions in the Volunteer Army and her martyrdom. He has successfully written a great and difficult-to-handle film village into this script, and its performance at the Chongqing National Academy of Drama has further proved its stage adaptability.

Since the Living Bookstore printed the script, the whole country has been vying to perform it. The Hong Kong Chinese Clerical Association, directed by Li Chenfeng, is performing it. The China Travel Agency is rehearsing it in Mandarin, and the Red and White Drama Troupe is rehearsing it in Cantonese. The China Travel Agency has scheduled charity performances at the Queen's Theater on the fourth and fifth nights of next month, and the others are also actively preparing to perform it in the shortest possible time.

### Call for Historical Materials on Spoken Drama by the National Academy of Drama

The spoken drama movement has been around for 30 years. In these 30 years, spoken drama has grown up in hard struggle. The historical facts that have been experienced should be left as valuable records. On the one hand, it is to recall the achievements of the predecessors in the drama circle who worked hard to create it, and on the other hand, it is to serve as a model for the latecomers to continue to struggle.

The collection and compilation of historical materials on spoken drama has not yet been managed by the government. Although there have been efforts by one or two drama lovers, they have been limited by the energy and financial resources of individuals, and the handling may be incomplete. Moreover, in today's world of war, the preservation and collection of historical materials are extremely difficult. Therefore, in view of the dangerous situation at the moment, our school has specially approved the Ministry of Education to set up a "Editorial Committee for the History of the Chinese Spoken Drama Movement" to formally engage in the collection, compilation, printing, and distribution of historical materials on the Chinese spoken drama movement.

In the past 30 years of the spoken drama movement, there have been a number of drama schools, drama troupes, drama people, and general schools and groups that have been involved in drama activities as a sideline. Whether they express themselves in writing or are active on the stage, they have left many valuable achievements. Among these achievements, whether they are printed matter, handwritten matter, photographs, or even oral accounts by the parties concerned, are all materials that should be adopted in the history of spoken drama.

Now the work of collecting historical materials has begun. It is hoped that all public and private drama schools, theaters, short-term drama training classes, amateur drama troupes, professional drama troupes, and mobile propaganda teams and drama troupes of party, government, military, educational, and cultural organizations, who have participated in drama activities in the past and present, will send us detailed and accurate information about the process of their establishment, the form of organization, the source of funds, the achievements of their work, and the solutions to technical problems. It is also requested that the predecessors in the drama circle and those in charge of the spoken drama movement in various places send us detailed information about the process of their personal advocacy of spoken drama, either in writing or in person. In particular, all documents related to spoken drama, such as founding declarations, organizational charters, plans, budget tables, meeting minutes, work reports, commemorative publications, rosters of all staff and actors, photographs, signatures, files, documents, drama books (theoretical history and scripts (drama publications (single books, magazines, periodicals, or newspapers, attached to drama　)) and wall newspapers, advertisements, ticket samples, power books, special issues, stage appearances, newspaper and periodical special issues or appendices (advertisements, reports, and criticisms of performances), and all other documents and classics related to drama, whether they are letterpress, lithographic, mimeographed, handwritten, photographed, clippings, old, new, intact, or damaged, are all earnestly hoped to be donated and collected or borrowed. Please send the items to "Editorial Committee for the History of the Chinese Spoken Drama Movement, National Academy of Drama, No. 12 Ranjiakang Lane" for compilation into a rich manuscript of the history of the Chinese spoken drama movement. We sincerely hope for this!

Sincerely, National Academy of Drama

### International Football Final Today - Chinese and Portuguese Teams Meet to Compete for the Championship - Kickoff at 4 PM at So Kon Po Stadium - Our Chinese Team is Strong and Can Regain the Top Spot

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the beginning of spring, there has been little rainfall, and the water shortage problem on the island is quite serious. Yesterday, spring thunder rumbled, shocking all plants and trees. Heavy rain poured down, and the landscape changed color. Fortunately, it was sweet dew from the willow branches, sprinkling all over the world, saving people from suffering.

However, yesterday's football spectacle was ruined by the heavy rain, and the good time was missed. What a day—the championship battle in the First Division League, forced to be temporarily suspended due to the heavens crying. Who is the owner of the famous flower, and the matter is still unclear, also teaching the footballing masses to be bored and spend this Saturday in vain, seeking pleasure in mischief.

This great battle will be rescheduled to 5 PM on Wednesday, the 19th of this month. Maybe Mai Shaohan, the famous Nan Hua Nan Nei Wei general, will be able to play at that time. If so, then yesterday's rain was beneficial to Nan Hua. The Navy side, aiming for both fame and fortune, was energetic. Who would have thought that they wouldn't get several thousand dollars yesterday? That's also bad luck. However, the money is ultimately theirs. Whether they get the championship is a question.

If it rains again today, I am afraid that the international final will also be postponed. We hope that the heavens will be kind and not make another mistake, so that the game can start as scheduled. It will surely cause a sensation. Good things are coming, but the heavens are in control.

Our Chinese team certainly has the possibility of winning all six major championships this year. This is not self-aggrandizement, nor is it a dream. Observing the current situation, as long as our athletes work hard to the end, they can succeed. If we win it all, there will be no flaws. This is a great achievement that will honor our ancestors and set an example for future generations.

This championship was established in 1925. The silver cup was donated by the English weekly newspaper. The participating teams are limited to nationalities. At the beginning, there were four teams participating in the competition: Greater China, Portugal, England, and Scotland. Later, Ireland and Wales were added. This year, there are still five teams competing together: China, Portugal, England, Scotland, and Ireland. The right to the final has been won by the Chinese and Portuguese teams, who will meet today to determine the winner. Let's see who wins the championship.

The match adopts a 90-minute system, so to win, the ball skills must be excellent, and the strength must be abundant. If one is lacking, it is difficult to succeed. This year, our Chinese team has a wealth of talent, gathering troops and assembling the army, and its strength is unsurpassed for a time. It was able to defeat the Soviet army in the first battle, and then conquer the English soldiers. If we take another step and defeat the Portuguese team today, we will retain the championship.

The ticket revenue will be allocated for charitable purposes. The players contribute their efforts, and the fans contribute their money. It can be said that each fulfills their responsibilities. I believe that this afternoon's So Kon Po will be packed with people, and another lively scene will unfold. However, it is necessary to have clear skies so as not to affect the revenue and to achieve satisfactory results.

The kickoff is at 4 PM. If the two teams are still tied after the stipulated 90 minutes, there will be an additional 20 minutes to determine the winner. Tickets will start selling at around 2 PM. Fans who want to get a good seat, please arrive early.

Greater China Team

Tan Junqian, Li Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng, Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Guo Yingqi, Hou Chengbo, Li Zhaorong, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Deng Guangsen

New Recruits: Yang Zixiang, Zhuo Shijin, Zhong Huilin, Liu Shizan, Liang Bowen

Portugal Team

W Sousa, Sousa, Remedi, Irins, Bi Ludo, Maxwell, Aruves, Roger, Gao Shannu, Panila, Ma Kuishi

New Recruits: Ma Shaner, Jialilu, Wo Te, Shen Dushi

Last Christmas, the Portuguese team first played against the Irish team. At that time, the Portuguese team's lineup was very complete. Because the front line had the services of Little Gao Shannu and Jin, the progress was rapid and the connection was dense, so they were able to eliminate the Irish team with a large score of seven to one. However, now Little Gao is a guest in Xiamen, and Jin has traveled south with the East and has not returned. With the loss of these two inside forwards, the offensive power will inevitably be affected, and Big Gao Shannu may lament that he is unable to clap with one hand because he cannot get support from others.

Our Chinese team has also lost one or two candidates due to the East's southern tour. However, the entire front line seems to have no leaks, and its strength is stronger than the Portuguese team's, and the hope of victory is also higher.

Our Chinese team's front line is the most ideal. Li Huitang has the certainty of scoring, Feng Jingxiang's dribbling is skillful, Li Zhaorong is good at scouting, and they sing in harmony with each other, making them indestructible. In addition, Hou Chengtao and Deng Guangsen's swift attacks are like flying generals coming from the sky, which will surely make the Portuguese defenders unable to defend.

The Portuguese team's defense is mainly based on Bi Ludo, Remedi, and Maxwell, but the whole is not perfect and will definitely not be able to control our Chinese team's front line. However, I can imagine that Bi Ludo will adopt the third inside defender's defensive method to intercept Huitang, so Huitang should also use the plan to lure the tiger away from the mountain, retreating slightly, trying to induce Bi Ludo to attack, and giving Jingxiang and Zhaorong the opportunity to attack from the side.

Big Gao Shannu is a dangerous element and must be fierce, but the left and right inside records are not top-notch materials, and they must not be very tacit with Big Gao, which will lead to Big Gao's helpless isolation and difficulty in going deep. However, Big Gao has the ability to find a way out, and he must be suppressed with all his might.

The Portuguese team's wings are also agile, and the cross-center back is not bad, so we must guard against their cut-in and Big Gao's head-on attack.

In short, it is expected that our Chinese team will win, but it is still necessary to work hard in this serious juncture of fighting for the championship. The list of previous champions is as follows (Football Field Tai Sui):

1925……Scotland

1926……Portugal

1927……Scotland

### 40 Countries to Participate in the Next World Games

### A Total of Six Teams Participating in the Hong Kong Open Baseball Tournament - Registration Fee Must Be Paid Before May 1st

As of now, there are six teams participating in the Hong Kong Open Baseball Tournament: Chinese Team (last year's champion), Minedenu (American ship), Western Club, MB Team, South China Club, and Hong Kong Club. The MB team is organized and paid by the Friendship Monument Manufacturing Company. Most of the personnel are members of last year's Volunteer Army baseball team, and their strength is not weak. The South China Club has not participated in baseball competitions for several years. Its reappearance this time has aroused a lot of interest among baseball audiences. It is noted that the club's strong players include Feng Jingxiang, Bao Jiaping, Zhu Guolun, Ye Zhaohua, etc., who dominated the hazelnut court in previous years, but it is not known whether they will be able to play this year. Because the South China Club already has the motive to travel south to Malaya, football players will definitely be selected to go, so the club's baseball warriors are trying to search for players. The teams participating in the competition must pay the report fee to the baseball association before May 1st in order to be valid, otherwise it will be invalid. The association is scheduled to start the competition at 2:30 PM on May 6th, when the Western Club will play against the MB team.

### Basketball Games Last Night: Kwong Tai Defeats Pui Ying, Second Division Lai Hang and Wah Nam Triumph; Three Second Division Games Today

The Open Men's Basketball League saw Lai Hang play Ling Ying in the first Second Division game last night. Lai Hang has been dubbed undefeated since the start of this season, while Ling Ying is also quite strong. Thus, in the first half, Lai Hang only led by 38 to 20. In the second half, Lai Hang was unstoppable. Wong Lung-sik, Luk Tak-cheung, Wong Lung-wu, and others demonstrated skill in passing and stealing, while Lam Yau-pui also had excellent plays. Until the end of the game, Lai Hang won overwhelmingly with a score of 93 to 37. In the second game, Kwong Tai faced Pui Ying in the First Division. The two teams were quite evenly matched, but unfortunately, neither side put on a spectacular performance, resulting only in a chaotic match. In the end, Pui Ying lost with a score of 42 to 53. Kwong Tai's Chan Kwong-luk demonstrated skill in shooting, with nimble turns, allowing him to break through the opponent's defense. Cheng Yuk-tong's dribbling was also excellent. Players such as Ng Hsuan-chiu and Lo Tung were also steady. However, the overall team coordination was lacking, but it was still much better than Pui Ying's, allowing them to take an early lead of 25 to 14 in the first half. It was observed that Pui Ying's coordination was not close enough, and the team members fought individually. Although there were excellent opportunities, they could not respond to each other, resulting in missed chances. Furthermore, the entire team lacked skilled shooters, which contributed to their defeat. In the first half, Chau Chu-siang and Ho Yat-sum worked extremely hard and fulfilled their duties. However, forwards Poon Kam-hung and defender Lam Man-li failed to act accordingly, repeatedly missing opportunities to win. Twenty minutes before the end of the game, Yau Kwong-sip played in the center, strategizing under the opponent's basket. At the same time, both Lam and Poon became active, and once closed the gap to 34 to 38. Unfortunately, Kwan and Ho were unable to resist, and the improved situation was fleeting. At the end of the game, Kwong Tai finally won with a score of 53 to 42.

In the game, Chan Kwong-luk of Kwong Tai opened the scoring, Liang Jiang-qiang made one free throw and one successful shot. Pui Ying only scored with a free throw by Lam Man-li. After a long chaotic struggle, Kwong Tai took the lead with advantages of 6 to 1 and 16 to 7. Later, Cheng Yuk-tong and Lo Tung scored consecutively. Yau Kwong-sip of Pui Ying responded in turn. At the end of the first half, Kwong Tai still led with 25 to 14. In the second half, Chan Kwong-luk of Kwong Tai was unstoppable, leading further with 31 to 18 and 37 to 29. Until Lai Wan-chak showed his potential and caught up, trailing by only two points. But in an instant, Chan Kwong-luk scored several baskets in a row. Therefore, at the end of the game, Kwong Tai finally won with a score of 53 to 42.

In the last game, Wah Nam played Chun Cho. During the game, Chun Cho had strong morale and accurate shots. In the first half, they led with 22 to 16. However, in the second half, Wah Nam launched a courageous counterattack. Cheuk Kwok-ying and Chiu Chun-piu scored consecutively, resulting in a final score of 43 to 34, turning defeat into victory.

### Today's Schedule

Today, three Second Division games will be held at the YMCA gymnasium. At 3:30 PM, Hoi Kwong will play Pui Ying. At 4:30 PM, the originally scheduled First Division game between Star Island and Wah Nam has been changed to Second Division Tai Koo against Hong Yuen. At 5:30 PM, Overseas Chinese will play Morning Light. Judging by the strength of each team, Pui Ying is stronger than Hoi Kwong and has a chance of winning. Tai Koo and Hong Yuen are evenly matched, and the outcome is unpredictable. Overseas Chinese is quite strong and progressive, so Morning Light is unlikely to win. Also, admission tickets for today's games will be waived. Outside visitors are welcome.

### Learning Swimming Knowledge

— Poon Chung-siu

The weather in the southern country in April has begun to tempt people to go to the cool world. In order to learn a life-saving skill, in order to improve health, and even to pursue the joy of water, they are all willing to step into the water to spend the summer days. However, how to satisfactorily achieve what is imagined deserves attention. Talking about it on paper without actual practice in the water will definitely not succeed. If one engages in water sports without getting the right method, the effect will not be seen, and the harm will come first. This is not intentionally alarmist. "Those who are good at swimming drown" is a common occurrence. It is essential for beginners to have the swimming knowledge they should have. It is a pity that many daring people act rashly and cause harm to themselves.

There are many ways to swim. They can be divided according to their different actions: (1) Crawl, also known as freestyle, because the movements of this swimming style are very agile and fast. (2) Back Stroke, also known as supine swimming. (3) BreastStroke, also called prone swimming or frog style, because its swimming posture is very similar to the frog's swimming movements. The butterfly style, which is slightly different from the frog style, has become popular in recent years. Sidestroke, underwater swimming and others, but beginners should proceed step by step, starting with what is easy. There is also water entry training, which is an item to further study the success of swimming. It greatly helps to increase interest in swimming and to apply swimming skills.

Be brave and careful. This is the supreme safety guarantee for swimmers. Otherwise, it is too dangerous. First, let's talk about courage. The reasons why beginners do not perform well can be generally divided into three: (a) Intermittent and insufficient practice time. (b) Poor practice methods. (c) Too little courage. As for how beginners can get rid of their fear of water, they must make the greatest determination to solve the problem. Those who are proficient in swimming and want to improve need even more help with courage, especially in water entry practice. If they are timid, they simply have no way to start.

Many people who are preparing to complete their swimming training want to know how to be considered proficient. Regarding this question, I would like to explain it here. First, you must have confidence in floating. Second, the movements must be able to propel the body forward. Third, breathing must be smooth. Being able to meet the above conditions means that even if the swimming skills are still very immature, the foundation for further study has been laid. The importance of swimming breathing is not only often overlooked by beginners, but also many people who are already proficient do not know how to seek improvement in this regard. This is because breathing is a prerequisite for swimming movements to be sustained.

Regarding swimming in the water, what should be paid attention to before entering the water, and after coming out of the water, I will briefly provide some general suggestions. Among them, many are bad habits that are easily committed, even by those who like to do water sports. The impact is not only detrimental to health.

(A) Before entering the water—It is better to start with swimming suits. There are many types of swimming suits, especially those worn by women, with various patterns. When choosing them, it is better to choose those made of thread, which are cheap, durable, and very lightweight. Although those made of wool are easy to drain water and have the benefit of keeping the body warm, the added burden of the amount of water they hold is very inconvenient. Therefore, when choosing a swimming suit, you should pay attention to whether it is lightweight and fits the body. Otherwise, it will easily hinder swimming movements. Second, wearing a swimming cap. The reason why swimmers wear swimming caps is not to protect their heads, nor to participate in water polo competitions to facilitate identification. The obvious purpose is to wrap the hair. If you are accustomed to wearing a swimming cap and suddenly take it off, you will immediately feel the pain of water and hair covering your eyes. It is better not to wear a swimming cap.

Next, if you really go into the water, you must first sprinkle water on your limbs to prevent the skin from being suddenly stimulated by a temperature lower than your body temperature. This is one of the causes of so-called cramps. Many swimmers who have just eaten too much or walked a long distance and whose body temperature has increased sharply should also not go into the water immediately. Also, if you are swimming in a place without facilities, you must check whether the water quality is too dirty, whether the water flow is too rapid, and whether there are floating objects before entering the water. However, beginners should always practice in swimming pools.

(B) In the water—Many people feel headaches while swimming. If there is no other reason, it is because of the stimulation of the sun. If you wet your hair with water, it will be fine. But to swim without wetting your hair is obviously afraid of water, or at least afraid of water splashing into your facial features. The more you try to avoid it, the more you make your movements clumsy. Therefore, it is also a bad habit to frequently wipe your face and eyes with your hands. Spitting casually in swimming pools that use tap water is harmful to public health and is immoral. Although the mouth feels uncomfortable from being hit by water, you must endure it. Otherwise, you will waste too much precious saliva, which will not only affect your digestive ability, but also make you more susceptible to germs. This is because the water quality is never completely pure, and the gastric juice weakens the ability to kill bacteria. Beginners, those who have not swum for a long time, and those who are weak should not stay in the water for too long and should often go ashore to rest. If your limbs are cold and stiff, or you feel tired, you should still come out of the water to rest. No matter how skilled a diver is, it is very dangerous to rush to the center in front of the diving platform. I will add more points to pay attention to. Do not urinate in the water for convenience. This can cause problems in the lower body.

(C) After coming out of the water—Take a bath and change clothes. If you are hungry and want to eat, please do not drink too much soda. First wash your hands and rinse your mouth. This is not a troublesome thing. If water gets into your ears, you should try to get it out. This is very simple. Jump frequently on your toes and tilt your head, and the water will come out. If the water quality is too poor, it is also very important to disinfect your eyes after swimming.

How to practice swimming? Freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke, underwater swimming, and even entering the water will be discussed next time.

### The Soul Lingers Around the Jiangmen Trees

— Kin Bun

A few days after the Mukden Incident, I quietly went alone to Jiao Tou, this beautiful and tranquil little village on the opposite bank of Jiangmen. There were rice fields connected by paths, low hills, streams, woods, and a normal school where I lived. At that time, the patriotic fervor was spreading throughout the hearts of every student, stirring and setting off a climax of anti-Japanese sentiment. We spread out to every corner of Xinhui County, running around and shouting, waving flags and shouting, spreading the seeds of resistance to all directions. As the government yielded and retreated, we were forced to abandon our beloved work and return to the classroom, studying unfamiliar pedagogy. The dull atmosphere gnawed at our hearts. It was during that time that I met several heroic young partners. We intertwined our lives, several people with one heart, trying to continue our unfinished aspirations. We constantly read books on national salvation, practiced climbing and running in the morning, and even fasted once a week, intending to strengthen ourselves through these trainings. At that time, the distance we ran became longer and longer every day, one kilometer, two thousand three thousand... We ran all over Jiao Tou, crossed the river to Jiangmen, followed the highway to Huajiao, and Xinhui did long-distance running. Although running in the cold wind was a difficult task, it was spiritually very gratifying. Every day after running, we climbed the low hills, looked at the highway in the distance, lowered our heads and pondered the Jiang River at our feet, dreaming that in the near future, a volunteer army would suddenly appear before us like a miracle. We immediately joined the ranks and embarked on the road to national salvation, how exciting! We waited for this news day after day, but it never came. The January 28th Incident passed, and the Shanghai Truce was established. Our immature minds, along with the dull situation, became colder and colder day by day. Finally, we waited until the summer vacation, when we were assigned to practice at the central elementary school. When all our enthusiastic hopes had become empty dreams, Jiao Tou, Jiangmen, Beijie, Xinhui City, the highways we had hastily walked on, still lay quietly, occasionally only raising a cloud of dust caused by cars, arousing a sigh from us.

After graduation, we dispersed. Some went north to join the 29th Army, some were assigned to work in township offices, and some continued to teach. I myself ran far away to Shanghai to study, living a decadent university life.

Today, the battle for Jiangmen has finally erupted. The small hills where we stood and pondered, the highways we ran and sweated on, the rivers we swam in against the cold wind, the haystacks where we lay and read books on national salvation... have all become battlefields, every inch of land stained with blood. Jiao Tou, Jiangmen, Beijie, Xinhui City, the familiar areas where we trained, every road has become a trench, every house has become a fortress. The fantasy we eagerly prayed for eight years ago has finally come true, the only difference is that the battlefield has moved from north to south, and the flames of war have spread throughout Guangdong. The only difference is that the heroic fighters are no longer limited to a few young boys who climb and run, but have turned into the vast laboring masses.

### On Writing Biographies of National Heroes

— Ze Fu

It is now widely believed that writing biographies of national heroes is very necessary, because on the one hand, it can promote the noble character displayed by our ancestors, and on the other hand, it can inspire our descendants today to have a due understanding of the nation. This kind of writing, of course, is aimed at the general public, so the writing should first use words that the general public can understand, and cannot simply copy some things from ancient history; second, it must be based on reliable materials, and the materials cannot be distorted, such as adding unnecessary mythical stories like in romance novels; third, brief annotations must be added, such as place names and official titles, so as not to create a sense of estrangement for the readers. Recently, because I have been collecting some materials in this area, unfortunately, I feel that there are some inadequacies, so I dare to express my humble opinions and discuss them with fellow writers.

First, what I mean by using words that the general public can understand is no longer a problem in the already published biographies of national heroes. Only the Commercial Press's "Juvenile Series" is still written in classical Chinese, which is because the publication date was still in the early years of the Republic of China, so it is not surprising. However, in the two books "Wen Tianxiang" and "Shi Kefa" (published by New Life) written by Yi Junzuo, the dialogue parts still quote the original text without translation, which is really inappropriate. For example, in "Wen Tianxiang," the examiner Wang Yinglin said to the emperor after reading Wen Tianxiang's examination paper: "This paper's ancient righteousness is like a tortoise shell mirror, and its loyal heart is like iron." "Loyal heart like iron" may still be understandable, but how can the public understand "ancient righteousness like a tortoise shell mirror"? However, translating classical Chinese into vernacular is indeed very difficult sometimes, so I think that in this kind of place, we only need to write the general meaning, and do not necessarily have to translate it literally. At the same time, when writing in vernacular, we should not be too literary. For example, Wu Shutian's "Yue Fei" (published by Children) starts with writing about the sun and black crows, which is quite poetic, but this is not of interest to the general public. Moreover, the story itself is magnificent, so I think it is better to get straight to the point and start with the excitement. This kind of poetic environment cannot arouse the reader's emotions. It is just like a war drama, but the opening scene is a beautiful garden setting, which always feels a bit out of place!

Second, what I mean by basing the writing on reliable materials is not a problem in itself, but the problem is that some of the reliable materials still have misunderstandings. For example, in Zhang Yiping's "Wen Tianxiang" (published by Children), in the section "Escaping from Jingkou," it says, "Tianxiang followed the Yuan army all the way, and the boat passed Qiantang. Seeing the picturesque scenery of the West Lake, he could not help but feel sad and his tears fell like rain. Later, he passed Wumen and arrived at Jingkou." According to the history, Tianxiang was in Lin'an (now Hangzhou), in the Yuan camp at Beigaoting Mountain, and was forced to go north by Boyan. This journey was actually north along the Grand Canal, so he passed Wumen (now Suzhou) and arrived at Jingkou (now Zhenjiang). Since he set off north from Lin'an, how could Tianxiang see the "picturesque scenery of the West Lake" again? There is no such statement in the History of the Song Dynasty, but it was mistakenly pulled in by Zhang Jun. Also, the same section says, "The person who supervised Tianxiang was named Wang Qianhu." Qianhu is an official title, not a name. This is also a misunderstanding, which is very different from the original meaning. Yi Junzuo's "Wen Tianxiang" also has similar mistakes. For example, it says, "In the first year of Jingding, the imperial court appointed him as the Jiedushi of the Zhennan Army." According to the biography of Liu Yueshen and Wen Chengxiang, it originally said, "He was appointed as the Pan Guan Ying Gongshi of the Ninghai Army Jiedushi. Tianxiang wrote a letter requesting the beheading of Dong Songchen, but was not approved, so he resigned and returned. He served at Zhennan Army with his previous position." Zhennan Army was also a Pan Guan Ying Gongshi of the Jiedushi, not a Jiedushi. Moreover, this was not a conferment, but simply a removal from office, so it cannot be called a "conferment." Furthermore, in Wu Shutian's "Yue Fei," in his "Battle of Dongting Lake," he mistakenly wrote "Zhang Jun as Zhang Jun," which can be said to be extremely negligent. He does not know that Jun and Jun were originally two people, how can they be confused? At the time, Zhang Jun was the Dudu of Zhuzi Army, and Yue Fei was only a general. To use today's situation as an analogy, one is the commander-in-chief and the other is the division commander. The division commander naturally has a distinction of superior and inferior to the commander-in-chief. But when Wu Jun wrote about Yue Fei speaking to Zhang Jun, it was: "There is no need, you only need to keep the troops for eight days, and I guarantee that I will pacify Dongting Lake." According to the History of the Song Dynasty, Biography of Fei, it said: "There is already a plan. If the Dudu can stay for a while, the bandits can be defeated in less than eight days." It is clear that he addressed him as Dudu and did not use "Ru" (you), but she changed it to a "you," which is like a commanding tone, which is really not the tone of speaking to a superior.

Third, what I mean by adding simple annotations is because the names of things are different from ancient times to today, and without annotations, it is difficult for the public to understand. For example, in the section where Yue Fei attacked Li Cheng, Li Cheng sent generals to invade "Hongzhou." This Hongzhou does not exist on the current map. If we add an annotation "that is, Nanchang, Jiangxi today," wouldn't it make it easier for readers to understand? Also, as mentioned above, Wen Tianxiang was "Pan Guan Ying Gongshi of the Ninghai Army Jiedushi." There is no such official title today. We may as well briefly say that this is an official in charge of writing and accounting. Unfortunately, most of the books we have seen do not pay attention to these things, especially the official titles, which are not annotated.

The above is only my humble opinion. The books listed are just examples. If there is anything offensive, please forgive the original author and the readers!

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

In the high and remote open space of clouds and snow, faint traces of the moon appear; under the moon, thin clouds still float, falling like snow, and the faint moonlight that penetrates from the gaps in the clouds and snow seems to be guiding him and her out of the dark wall they have been lingering by for a long time.

However, she still said to him:

"You must promise me a condition to guarantee my safety."

"I can absolutely promise you!"

So, she started walking with him. After a few steps, she stopped again and said to him urgently:

"You have to tell me, when will you let me go back?"

"Whenever your family sends the money, that's when I'll let you go back."

"My dad loves money. What if he never sends the money?"

"Then I will definitely let you go back!"

"How long?"

He carefully considered it and said:

"Within two months."

"No, two months is too long! One month at most. Do you promise me?"

"I promise you!"

Then, she continued to walk the unfinished snowy road with him. Now, he and she have become two freely united travelers. Soon, they turned from the darkness to a brighter road; the lights of the shops along the road tempted her and him to look at each other from time to time. Whenever their eyes met, they immediately avoided each other and casually shifted their gaze to a certain point; after a while, they would secretly shift their gaze back to each other, as if to ask:

"What are you thinking about?" (38)

### Outside the Desolate Suburbs

— Zhang Zhenshan

Facing a gust of desolate cold air, rushing down the hillside, it is already the season of early spring, why is the wilderness still stiff and frozen, without a hint of green? Gloomy, desolate, a gust of wind blows through the grass on the graves, and it even makes a terrifying sharp sound.

Stopping, gazing at the desolate tombs: those messy residual grasses, withered thorns, intertwined into a yellow carpet, spread out; the tombstones are lying there, desolate and silent, no one commemorates them, and no poets come to chant.

"Let's do it here! Use the desolate tombs as fortresses, and the coffins as gun racks, so we can face the highway in front."

The old man who said this immediately waved his mud shovel and easily dug a hole with a diameter of one foot, as if digging a steamed bun. He squeezed his body in, waited quietly, and glared out of a small hole with the machine gun handle! After we flattened the dug-up mud and residual grass, we also quickly passed through the jungle.

This area was considered to have been "swept clean", and the smell of gunpowder in the air seemed to have disappeared. The ××s were so complacent, wriggling on the winding highway like a long snake, their scattered black shadows like wild dogs looking for food, making the old man lying in the desolate tombs burn with anger, but he had to endure and hold his breath, letting time pass quietly. From dawn to noon, and then to dusk, he hid like a pair of silkworms lying in cocoons, remembering the captain's instructions: - The devils think this area has been "swept clean", so wait until their vigilance is relaxed, estimate that it can meet our amount of annihilation, and then do it!

The scattered devil shadows aroused his anger, and he suppressed it countless times by reviewing the instructions, and continued to wait, watch, estimate, and wait for dozens of hours.

Time was approaching dusk of the second day.

In the silent twilight, a burst of noise came from the highway. Three ××s with handlebar mustaches and gold-rimmed glasses came riding on tall horses, their command knives flashing with brilliant silver light, complacent and arrogant, followed by a large group. The motorcycles bumped on the highway, looking very heavy, probably loaded with ammunition?

At this time, the old man estimated and laughed: the fire of anger burned up, violently and swiftly, through his whole body: he held the machine gun - ge ge ge... - and fiercely swept a burst.

The people with handlebar mustaches and gold-rimmed glasses immediately fell off their horses and quickly fell down, their dirty blood splattering all over the ground. The ××s who were not killed behind were all stunned and frantically fired around, and a fire net crisscrossed in the sky, covering the empty wilderness.

The ××s were probably wondering, right? Is this human world, or a dream? Looking around, there were only silent jungles and desolate tombs in the wilderness, and no one else.

When they ran to encircle the jungle, the old man laughed so hard that his stomach hurt, and he lay down to eat dry food.

After a burst of running, the old man fired another burst, and under the fire net, who knows how many ××s fell.

The night gradually deepened, and the ××s who had missed the attack were still frightened and anxious; angry, they relied on their sophisticated equipment to exert its destructive power: - boom... tong... dong... the mountain guns shook the entire wilderness, and the flames spread on the dry weeds; the old man's hot blood also boiled, but he more calmly caressed the machine gun handle: ge ge ge ge ge... then laughed loudly again.

### The Last Poem of Spring

— Yuan Shuipai

'Spring, sweet spring, the merry monarch of the year;

Then each thing puts forth; al that tread,

Dance in light rounds, Celía sings high,

The cold is not stingless; Philomel,

Jug, jug, jug, jug, jug, to dirty ears!'

Thomas Nashe's spring!

The chrysanthemum's spring,

In the shepherd's flute,

The happy exclamation mark,

Purple, yellow, blue,

Elizabethan chrysanthemum,

Elizabethan spring.

Only shoulder blades, spinal bones, leg bones, etc. remain,

Like the firewood dropped by scavengers in the suburbs;

Only unexploded shells remain inserted in the trees,

As unblown flower buds (others bloom in the flesh);

Only the tiled houses that have been turned into mud for the second time remain;

Only the torn passionate flags are paralyzed in

The already repainted colorful national borders;

Only shameless traitors ascend the Dragon Throne

Abyssinia,

Austria,

Czechoslovakia,

Spain,

Albania -

Which one is in the newspaper today?

Spring, spring belongs to the fishing Neville;

So anything can be done, in front of everyone

Bargaining, playing magic, threatening, prostituting,

Parliament, questioning, answering, questioning...

Final act, sold, destroyed.

Adolf Hitler's spring!

Axis spring,

In the machine gun barrel

The trembling exclamation mark

Nails the independent countries of Europe

On the hooked black swastika.
