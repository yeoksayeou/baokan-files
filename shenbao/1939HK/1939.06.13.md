### Political Workers in the Battlefield in Northern Jiangxi

— Sent by Wei Chu from the Frontlines of Northern Jiangxi

At the end of March, while the Japanese were attacking Nanchang on one front, they divided their forces to successively occupy Fengxin and Gao'an, and continued to aggressively invade westward. We had just rushed to the border of Gao'an and Fengxin when we received the task of blocking the Japanese forces. On the afternoon of the 30th, our vanguard troops engaged in a bloody battle with the Japanese. The division commander immediately gave us an urgent task: to mobilize the masses to organize stretcher teams and set up casualty transport stations, to transport the wounded as quickly as possible. Although most of the civilians on the front lines had fled, mobilization was extremely difficult, but we accepted the task without hesitation and set off overnight. Our destination was Xiao Fang, a village more than ten miles away from the division headquarters.

The civilians had all run away, making it difficult to even find a guide. After a long time, we finally managed to find an old man. At first, he was very afraid and unwilling. We first gave him two dimes and assured him that we would give him a pass to return home the next day, which made him happy to lead us. The road we took was all small hills and woods. Without a guide, it would be difficult to find our way even during the day, let alone at night.

The sound of artillery fire from the front lines became increasingly tense. The bright moonlight illuminated the long sky and earth flashing with bloody rain.

Xiao Fang was quietly hiding in the embrace of dense trees. We arrived late at night, and the first problem to solve was finding the civilians. We started knocking on doors, but some places were already empty before you even knocked, while others we knocked and shouted for a long time without a response. This made us anxious. We searched all over the village, but still had no results. At the same time, a dark cloud was advancing across the sky, with flashes of lightning, threatening a heavy rain. In our urgency, we realized that we had to cherish this guide. Political work had to start with him.

"Bang, bang, bang..." We knocked, but there was still no response.

"Uncle! Uncle! Please open the door."

"Who is it?" Thank goodness, the reply from inside the door was in the local dialect.

"It's XXX, from XXX place, wanting to ask for a place to stay for the night."

"Why come here so late at night?" a middle-aged man's voice asked.

"Going to carry things for the army... hurrying back, but it's too late," the guide replied, showing his resourcefulness.

"Uncle! Weren't there soldiers banging on doors in the village just now?" a woman's voice asked.

"They're gone, they're gone, they've left the village," the guide replied, making a face at us.

As soon as the door opened, they immediately wanted to close it again when they saw us, but we had already squeezed in. The house was dark, with only an old woman huddled in a corner, trembling. We gently put down our things and slowly went up to her and said, "Auntie, don't be afraid. We are the anti-Japanese army, here to fight the Japanese and protect you." "Don't worry, our anti-Japanese army doesn't conscript people or disturb you!" One comrade after another spoke to her kindly. At the same time, we asked the guide to help us explain. After a long time, she finally ran out of the dark corner, trembling: "Generals! You are good soldiers, I'm not afraid." Seeing her like that, her fear was still very serious. We lit a lamp and sat down quietly to talk to her gently and kindly, explaining things. Seeing that her fear had subsided a lot, we asked her, "Auntie, where are the rest of your family?" "Generals! They're afraid of airplanes and ran away long ago, leaving only me at home!" She still didn't trust us.

The back door was open, clearly indicating that people had just left. We slipped out to take a look, and saw a cluster of people huddled together on a small hill nearby. "Uncles! Don't be afraid, we're not conscripting!" Before we could finish speaking, the cluster of people desperately scrambled over the hill and left. Helpless, we went back and patiently and sincerely spoke to the old woman. After a long time, she finally trusted us, picked up a lantern, and ran out the back door to shout for a long time. After a while, men, women, and children slipped back one by one, filling the house.

The old woman's son was a young student. We talked to him for a long time, and he finally fully understood us and explained things to his family.

"Oh! Generals: some bad troops in the past scared us badly! If it weren't for my mother calling us back, we would have had to spend the night in the open," a young woman said to us boldly, causing everyone to laugh.

They busied themselves finding door panels and straw for us, boiling water for tea..., and the old lady brought out two plates of peanuts and fried beans from the room. They ate and talked warmly. They had previously been more afraid of us than the King of Hell, but now they saw us as relatives and friends.

The first thing we had to do when we got up was to find the village head. On the front lines, it wasn't easy for troops to find the village head or neighborhood chief. Often, many village heads and neighborhood chiefs would run into you, and when you asked them where the village head was, they would answer, "That doggone guy ran away long ago." Of course, there were many reasons for this, but the main one was that most neighborhood chiefs weren't responsible enough and were afraid of trouble. Secondly, even today, there are still very few troops and individual soldiers who engage in various illegal acts against local authorities.

Led by the son of the family we were staying with, we found the village head directly without any effort. He was a young man, lively and energetic. Although we arrived early, he was already on the phone, dealing with official business.

When we showed him the official document asking him to help mobilize the masses to organize stretcher teams, he agreed without hesitation and immediately wrote official documents to each neighborhood, like a powerful call: "The Japanese devils are attacking our hometown, we must quickly rise up and help the army fight, carry the wounded... there is also a wage of fifty cents a day..." He quickly ordered the public servants to send them out and sent people to notify the neighboring neighborhood chiefs to step up mobilization.

We quietly waited for him to finish handling the official business before starting to talk.

"Oh! It's terrible, I'm simply too busy!" He shook his head, his hair disheveled, his feet bare.

"Village head! You're working too hard!" We offered him a sincere word of comfort.

"How can that compare to you? The Japanese devils are attacking our home, if I don't work hard and help the army, what kind of talk would that be?"

This village head was truly rare. The orders from above were so numerous: destroy the roads, a certain number of civilians needed within a few days, or be beheaded; transport grain, a certain number of civilians needed, or be beheaded; the XXX headquarters needs a certain number of laborers within a few days, or be beheaded. However, many of the farmers in his village had already fled due to the tense situation. The required number of people far exceeded what he could mobilize. However, he said, "I won't run away, I'll do my best, I'm prepared to lose my head... However, it's not right for the higher-ups to put so many things on the shoulders of a few village heads. Why not pursue those village heads who ran away?"

The village head hadn't been paid his living expenses for eight months. Reports and requests were useless. Furthermore, the county magistrate had withheld some of the special expenses for local office expenses stipulated by the province, and it was unknown what they were used for. There were many things that needed to be done locally, but they had to be stopped. As for the family members of soldiers going off to war, it was unknown where those funds had gone. "Ah! Comrades! You don't know the suffering of lower-level administrative personnel! If my family didn't still have a few coins, I would really have to sell my wife to do public service." The village head issued a painful cry to us.

He wanted to lead the local masses to fight a guerrilla war, but he didn't have any guns. Although he had already submitted a request to his superiors.

As we were talking, the village head suddenly picked up the small clock on the table and looked at it. It was almost eight o'clock. He immediately put on his clothes and shoes, and stuck a small gun in his belt. He said straightforwardly, "Please sit and chat, I have to go to the road to take a look at the destruction," and he quickly left.

We busied ourselves finding a house, setting up a transport station, finding straw, preparing stretchers, preparing tea and thin porridge... With the automatic help of a dozen or so civilians, everything was done in a flash. In particular, the host family and their neighbors helped a lot. Even the orderly understood this principle! "Civilians will definitely help us as long as our troops treat them well. Official airs and tempers are unacceptable in front of civilians."

### The Developing Jinan Base Area

— Liang Bian

Anti-Japanese Trends in Jinan

(Newsletter from the People's Revolutionary Society) Recently, someone returned from the front lines in Hebei, bringing back a lot of news. Because I haven't systematically organized it, I can only write down a few fragments to share with readers who are concerned about the situation in Jinan.

1. The Hardworking Style of Civil Servants

The regimes in Jinan were mostly established after guerrilla units and some regular troops fought countless battles to drive out the Japanese. Therefore, the elected anti-Japanese regimes here particularly maintain a spirit and style of hardship and perseverance. In Nei Qiu County (in the Ji 4 area), government personnel still eat chaff to this day. They make the chaff into cornbread, but they have to eat it while it's hot, otherwise it will scatter into a pile of chaff. This kind of cornbread is their regular food. It doesn't digest easily, and it's very painful when they have a bowel movement.

The situation in Jing Long County's anti-Japanese government is similar. County government officials often have to quickly find food for dinner after eating breakfast.

The county magistrate's monthly stipend is only one yuan (it used to be fifty cents), and the commissioner only gets two yuan, but material difficulties never affect their enthusiasm for work. On the contrary, as the situation in North China becomes more urgent, they show their determination and effort even more.

2. Freely Entering and Exiting the Japanese Blockade Line

The government's arduous struggle and the army's heroic battles have weakened the Japanese forces in Hebei, making the vast majority of people in Hebei realize that China is certain to win in the end. The conditions among the masses are good, providing great convenience to the government and the army.

Government and army personnel can disguise themselves as civilians and take trains to Shijiazhuang and Beijing. The government's cooperatives can go to Shijiazhuang to purchase goods. Even government personnel can return to the Japanese-controlled areas to celebrate the New Year without any problems. This is mainly due to the protection of the masses.

Most of Gao Yi County (on the Pinghan Railway) is in the Japanese-controlled area, but our county government personnel can still carry out their work in plain clothes and implement the anti-war laws of the National Government.

The Pinghan Railway is supposed to be strictly monitored by the Japanese, but with the protection of our people, anyone can freely walk from the east side to the west side, or from the west side to the east side, as long as they wear plain clothes and carry a good citizen certificate (issued by the Japanese, but sometimes they don't even need to carry it). Our troops pass through the blockade line in large numbers. The Japanese sometimes know this, but they can't do anything about it.

3. Puppet Organizations Also Come to Console Us

Here's a very interesting story. This happened in January of this year in XXX County near the Pinghan Railway. Our XXX Army annihilated more than a hundred Japanese soldiers, which greatly excited the local troops. They launched a large-scale consolation movement, and even the people in the Japanese-controlled area donated a large number of pigs and sheep. A county magistrate of XXX County deducted dozens of yuan from his own salary and asked someone from the county seat to send the money to our anti-Japanese army. This story shows that our victory has also deeply moved the internal members of the puppet organizations. We believe that as long as we continue to increase our victories, it will be no problem to win over and disintegrate the puppet organizations.

4. The Japanese Are Our Transportation Team

The telephone lines seen in the Jinan area are all crooked or connected by many lines. It is said that these were all given to us by the Japanese. The telephone lines of the Japanese on the Pinghan Railway and other transportation lines are often destroyed by us. We take the telephone lines seized from the Japanese and install them on our own telephone poles. In order to maintain communication, the Japanese have to repair them frequently, but the more diligent the Japanese are in repairing, the more diligent we are in destroying. As a result, the Japanese telephone lines are continuously given to us.

The trains on the Pinghan Railway are also often attacked by us, so the Japanese have to send us some gifts.

5. The Anti-Japanese Base Area in Western Ji is Expanding

On the map, you can see a narrow strip west of the Pinghan Railway and east of the Taihang Mountains. This is the anti-Japanese base area in western Ji. The area north of the Zhengtai Railway belongs to the Chaji Border Region, and the area south belongs to the Jinan Administrative Region. What I am talking about here is the southern part.

The Ji Xi base area was built from scratch, but it has made rapid progress in the past year or so.

Fair burden has begun to be implemented, the Senate has also begun to be established, and the masses are becoming more and more sound and consolidated. The government has been able to achieve unified planning and distribution, and the organization has become more and more consolidated. The atmosphere in Ji Xi is very active. The consolidation and expansion of Ji Xi has a great effect on the development of the Ji Nan Administrative Region.

### Children's Groups in Guilin

— Qiu Jiang

(Guilin Newsletter) Children are the new life of the new China, and they are the symbol of the new China.

Now, they are raising their small feet and kicking over the past adult's underestimation of "children", refuting the idea of "who says we are young" with facts, proving the power of children with action. Fan Zheng, a twelve-year-old child from the New Fourth Route Army, wrote articles in the "National Salvation Daily" that were as experienced as an adult's, describing the power of children. Bai Jiansheng's nine-year-old daughter, Bai Xianhui, conducted a children's choir at a concert. Children can also do some of the things that adults do. "Each generation is stronger than the last" - this belief rolls in the minds of adults, and at the same time, it moves some unmotivated adults.

The "Children's Troupe," which grew up during the "August 13th Incident," and the "New Fourth Route Army," which practiced Tao Xingzhi's educational theory of "life is education, society is school," after arriving in Guilin, the collective living, working, and education of these children influenced the children of Guangxi. Their initial union was at the Guangxi Children's Song and Ballad Conference last December. In helping Guangxi children organize song and ballad conferences, they found that the organization of Guangxi children was insufficient. The Party Department hoped that they would strengthen the organization of Guangxi children. From then on, the "Old Brother" Children's Corps had a great influence on the children of Guilin. And they really looked like an "Old Brother", loving and leading, so that Guangxi children could work, live, and study in an organized way, and exert the power of children to help adults fight the Japanese.

Among the six children's corps in Guilin, the earliest established was the "Children's Work Corps of the Guangxi Provincial All Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association". This children's corps has a short history and is enthusiastically doing children's salvation work under the guidance of the current Kuomintang Party Department. It is a pity that there is not much funding, and it is not easy to carry out work.

However, the children all live at home, and collective living, working, and learning is impossible. This is the shortcoming of all children's corps in Guilin. It's not that the children are greedy for their parents' love. If you don't believe it, I can quote what the children of the "Children's Education Corps" shouted: "We really envy you (the New Fourth Route Army), everyone lives together, learns together, works together, runs together, how happy that is!" to explain. Their difficulty is that the daily supplies for dozens of small bellies cannot be regularly raised. However, although they do not live together, the spirit of work is still tense. When work is assigned to the children, no one says "Mom won't let me go" or makes excuses to shirk responsibility. They braved the heavy rain to go to Daxu, thirty miles away from Guilin, to promote and comfort the wounded soldiers.

In the work, they gained encouragement and confidence. A child in charge of life guidance at the Children's Work Corps said: "Some wounded soldiers don't follow the rules and scold the people, but they are very nice to us children. When we criticize them, those wounded soldiers can listen to us, and even ordinary people are close to us." This is the greatness of the power of children.

In addition to the Children's Work Service Corps and the Children's Education Corps, there are also the Zhongshan Memorial School Children's Wartime Service Corps, the Guangxi Children's Welfare Institute Salvation Work Team, the New Fourth Route Army, and the "New Journey" Southwest Work Team. The former two are naturally prominent in the Guilin Children's Corps because of their activity. The latter two are the "Old Brothers" of the Guilin Children's Corps, playing a leading and influential role in work, life, and learning. In order to have a general leadership organization for the Guilin Children's Corps, the "Guilin Children's Corps Symposium" was organized. In addition to discussing the distribution and planning of propaganda work, current affairs, and foreign activities, the most important thing was to solve and discuss the difficulties encountered by the various children's corps in organization, leadership, work, life, and learning. They also compile the "Anti-War Children" weekly magazine. After Mr. Bai Jiansheng invited them to watch the Soviet film "The Great Turning Point," the symposium wrote a letter to Director Bai to express their warm gratitude and put forward their specific feelings in the letter. When watching the film, Director Bai taught his children to learn from them, which shows his love for these children.

They are so brave that they launched the "Ten Thousand Yuan Children's Fundraising Movement" in Guilin this year on Children's Day. The "New Journey" children plan to write a book on "The Theory of the Chinese Children's Movement", which is divided into four sections: organization and theory, and the present and the future. Because the work scope of the "New Journey" is dispersed, Zeng Zhaoshou, a herding boy from Jiangbei - a child in their group - used old radio equipment to configure a radio transceiver to communicate with work teams scattered everywhere. The children in charge of the "New Journey" need to develop their interests and talents, and support him as much as possible, no matter how difficult the economy is.

Outside of Guangxi, there are the "Refugee Children's Team" led by Mr. Tian Han in Changsha; there are the most in Nanchang, including the Children's Troupe of the Thirty-second Army; eight youth corps, twelve children's corps based in schools; the Children's Troupe of Anyuan Rotary Elementary School; the "Anti-War Children's Reading and Doing Association" in Jun County, northern Hubei; the "Anti-Japanese Children's Corps" in Shou County, Anhui, which set fire to granaries; the "New Fourth Army Children's Corps" which rescued children in the occupied area; the "Guangdong Children's Troupe" and the "Qujiang Children's Choir"; the "Three People's Principles Youth Corps" in Guiyang, and many other children's corps that have not been written about, all organized themselves and stood in the child's position to bravely resist the war.

### The Dare-to-Die Corps in Western Shanxi

— Dai Fu

(Western Shanxi Correspondent) The border between the four counties of Linfen, Xiangling, Yicheng, and Fushan is a mountainous area with overlapping mountains and crisscrossing gullies. It is only twenty miles away from the Datong-Puzhou Railway to the west. It can control the Quyi section of the Qugao Highway to the south. It can cut off Linfu and Chedao to the north. Relying on the rugged terrain to the east, it is possible to completely block the traffic of Yifu. After the Japanese occupied Linfen and Quwo, this area was calm. The Japanese didn't come often. When they came, they would plunder things and leave. But in August of last year, the Dare-to-Die Corps, the Youth Anti-Japanese Forces arrived, and everything became active.

A hundred or so catties of electric wires on the Datong-Puzhou Road would disappear overnight. The spiral nails, iron bars, and sleepers on the railway would be found thrown into the Fen River, lost in the mountains, or missing at dawn. The "Imperial Army" at the Linfen Zhangli, Shicun, and other stations could not go to the countryside. At any time, a sudden bomb would explode in front of them.

After the Japanese learned about the guerrilla forces, they used traitors to scout and carry out sweeps. However, they either missed their target or fired a few shots and shook their heads to retreat back to the city.

The Dare-to-Die Corps became stronger and healthier in the battles. In this small guerrilla area, as a result of activities day and night for a month, the Japanese, after shaking their heads in the sweeps, specially stationed more than a thousand people in the villages along the Datong-Puzhou line from Linfen to Quwo. Soldiers of the Dare-to-Die Corps could suddenly be found anywhere. Therefore, the Japanese had to station troops in any village close to the railway.

Due to the prolongation of the war, the "Imperial Army" did not have much rice to transport. They needed wheat and vegetables. They had to take these things from the countryside. The Japanese often came to villages ten miles away from the railway with a force of two hundred people to plunder. As soon as they looted, someone would report to the Dare-to-Die Corps, who was determined to cut off the Japanese's livelihood. They then set up ambushes, dispersed the Japanese, and returned the looted items to the people.

The Japanese did not dare to leave the villages where they were stationed alone. They were afraid of sudden shots and grenades.

The local people had organized organizations, such as the Sacrificial Alliance, the Farmers' Salvation Association, the Women's Salvation Association, and the Self-Defense Force (which did not leave production). The closer they were to the Japanese-occupied area, the more they adopted secret work methods, and the more they exerted their great power. During the day, if the Japanese swept in, the women and old people would leave, and the young people would offer tea, braving the rain of bullets to send it to the soldiers who were fighting. Those who were injured were carried to the back, and women would take care of them immediately. The Dare-to-Die Corps fought many battles like this here. There was no difference between the Dare-to-Die Corps and the people. The Dare-to-Die Corps relied on the people for help during battles, and after battles, the people who were injured were carried to the Dare-to-Die Corps' rear hospital.

The people kept watch outside the villages at night. The soldiers and the people knew each other well. In the middle of the night, they broke the railway. When they walked to any village, as long as they told a sentry of the Self-Defense Force outside the village and waited for a while, a group of people would come with furniture and follow them to dig up the rails and sleepers.

The close cooperation between the military and the people consolidated this small guerrilla area.

Although it was a small guerrilla area, it had the following effects: it threatened the Datong-Puzhou line, contained the Japanese forces, made the puppet regime only able to exercise power in the city, protected the lives and property of the vast rural people, and made the Japanese unable to occupy Fushan and Yicheng without any concern.

Now that the Japanese are planning to attack the entire southeastern Shanxi, they naturally cannot ignore this small guerrilla area. In mid-to-late February, the Japanese occupied Yicheng and Fushan and began a five-pronged attack (Linfen, Shicun, Yicheng, Xiangshui River, Fushan). The combined army of infantry, cavalry, and artillery numbered more than three thousand people. However, the Dare-to-Die Corps ambushed them at Nanpanqiao, killing more than three hundred Japanese and breaking through the encirclement. In the mountainous area, the Japanese could not stay for long and withdrew after only one day. The Dare-to-Die Corps returned to its original place. With the close cooperation of the military and the people, this small guerrilla area has been consolidated.

### Yen Group and the "Huaxing Bank"

— Wu Zhixuan

Japanese warlords' means of aggression towards China involve both economic and military force. They are hostile to the stability of China's legal tender system. Therefore, they have been scheming to deliberately undermine it for more than a day. Last year, they established a "United Reserve Bank" in North China, issuing "United Reserve Bank" notes without reserves, aiming to drive out legal tender. They also plotted to monopolize trade and resources in China, pulling the "United Reserve Bank" into the yen group. This tactic had some effect in Manchukuo, but in North China, it has clearly failed. Legal tender still maintains its credibility and holds a strong position in North China. Despite repeated attempts to use force to depreciate the value of legal tender, not only has this been resisted, but the value of "United Reserve Bank" notes has plummeted daily. Recently, the market price for "suppressing notes" has been only about 80 cents against legal tender.

The recent sharp decline of the yen in Shanghai, although due to various factors, is also mainly attributable to its connection with "United Reserve Bank" notes. Truly, harming others harms oneself.

Having suffered a setback with the "United Reserve Bank," they recently established the bogus "Huaxing Commercial Bank" in Shanghai. The planned "Huaxing notes" have been decisively severed from the yen, a lesson learned from a great loss. They know that the "Huaxing Bank" has no future, so they simply made a clean break to disassociate themselves. As for its circulation strategy, it is said to be: (1) Designated commodities will be sold exclusively in "Huaxing" currency. (2) "Huaxing" currency will be used to forcibly purchase products from the occupied areas. (3) Transactions will be stipulated to be conducted in "Huaxing" currency. (4) All taxes, postal services, telegrams, telephone, electricity, tap water, and transportation tickets will be paid in "Huaxing" currency. (5) All payments from the puppet regime will be made in "Huaxing" currency. Their intentions are nothing more than: (1) To control trade. (2) To directly collect goods and materials in the occupied areas with "Huaxing" currency. (3) To attempt to disrupt finance in Central China. (4) Because the issuance of Japanese paper money has inflated too much to continue, future military expenditures will be met by issuing unbacked "Huaxing" notes, allowing them to linger on.

The future of the puppet "Huaxing Bank" can be predicted based on the failure of the "United Reserve Bank" in North China. If "United Reserve Bank" notes, linked to the yen, have already plummeted, how much more so the "Huaxing" currency, whose relationship with the yen has been severed? Even if the Japanese side uses Yangtze River commerce as leverage, forcing Britain, the United States, and France to endorse this bogus currency, the fundamental purpose of this bogus currency is to exclude European and American markets in China. Therefore, Britain, the United States, and France will have no reason to accept the bogus currency or support the bogus regime.

As for the Shanghai banking industry, it has already expressed its refusal to accept it, and even small money shops will not exchange it.

Shanghai is a commercial port with an import surplus. The "Huaxing Bank's" attempt to control foreign exchange is even more hopeless, because it has no substantial foreign exchange funds to supply imports. The export foreign exchange it can seize will also be limited. Therefore, it is predicted that the Shanghai foreign exchange market will continue to be controlled by foreign banks.

### Six Days of Bloody Battle Annihilated Tens of Thousands – Our Army Wins a Great Victory in Zhongtiao Mountain – The Entire Front in Central Hubei is Silent – Xiang and Gan Are Stable – The Army in Zengcheng and Conghua Was Defeated by Us

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 12th] Since the × (enemy) in southern Shanxi were conquered by our army at the two strongholds of Pinglu and Maojindu, our military prestige has greatly increased, and river defenses are more solidified. We are taking advantage of our victory to sweep away the × (enemy), × (enemy) morale is frustrated, most of them have fled to the north of Zhongtiao Mountain, and a small number have fled to Zhangdian. Currently, there are over two thousand × (enemy) soldiers in the area south of Dachen Village, and over three thousand × (enemy) soldiers south of Xisheng Xia Niu and Zhangdian. Our army is already encircling and attacking them from all directions.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 11th] Frontline telephone report, the × (enemy) who have repeatedly attacked Zhongtiao Mountain are the entire 20th Division, led by Ushijima, and half of the newly arrived 37th Division, along with two artillery regiments and a squadron of aircraft, totaling over 30,000 men. According to the × (enemy) side, this is their full-force offensive on Zhongtiao Mountain. However, after six days of bloody battle, the × (enemy)'s casualties have reached over 10,000 men, accounting for one-third of their total force. The number of × (enemy) annihilated has created a new record for battles in North China this year. The statistics of × (enemy) deaths are as follows: (1) From the 7th to the evening of the 8th, the × (enemy) attacked our Dachen Village position with over 200 men. Our ×× Brigade's Zheng Regiment led its troops in a brave resistance. The × (enemy) attacked for two days and one night, but ultimately failed. In this battle, over a thousand × (enemy) were killed, and our position remained unmoved. Zheng Regiment won a glorious victory. (2) In the battle for the high ground at Ershili Ridge on the 9th, the × (enemy) left over 800 bodies at the site. (3) On the 9th, the × (enemy) captured Pinglu, suffering over a thousand casualties. (4) On the morning of the 10th, they captured Maojindu, suffering 500 casualties.

(6) On the 9th, our army encountered the × (enemy) artillery platoon (Tianmura platoon of the 77th Regiment) and infantry platoon (Mizui platoon of the 77th Regiment) in Che Village East Village, northwest of Pinglu, killing over 200 × (enemy), including the Mizui platoon leader, and capturing over ten prisoners and over a hundred horses. (7) As of the 9th, approximately 2,000 puppet soldiers were transported north from Zhangdian Town via Tongshan Town, along with 300-400 corpses. According to the statistics from the above armies, there have already been over 8,000 casualties. Including those not yet counted, the number is definitely more than 10,000. It is estimated that the × (enemy)'s casualties in this offensive will reach 10,000. The captured spoils of war are currently being inventoried. In short, this offensive was the most disastrous the × (enemy) has suffered in their repeated attacks on Zhongtiao Mountain. Previously, Commander-in-Chief Wei Lihuang of the Second War Area told reporters that Zhongtiao Mountain would be the × (enemy)'s graveyard. The × (enemy) people will regard this as a warning.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 12th] The two × (enemy) captains, Kobayashi and Amasaka, as well as their translators, were all killed by our army during the battle of Mount Wutai. The × (enemy) held meetings in various places to mourn them.

[Central News Agency, Yichang, 12th] The entire front in central Hubei is quiet. However, our guerrillas have been very active in recent days. The highway near Wamiaodian on the Han-Yi Road has been damaged by us in many places, making military transportation extremely difficult. There have been no changes in Qianjiang.

[Central News Agency, Fancheng, 12th] The × (enemy) in Qianjiang and Luohansi, apart from occasional artillery battles across the river and minor contact with us on the east bank of the river, have not taken any aggressive action.

[Central News Agency, Xiushui, 11th] On the 9th, our army launched a two-pronged attack on the × (enemy) west of Wuning, completely routing the remnants twelve li from the city.

[Central News Agency, Miluo, 11th] Since dawn on the 11th, our troops north of Xinqiang, with the momentum of continuously capturing Dayun Mountain Zhongfang, launched a full-scale attack on the × (enemy). The right flank approached Xitang Longwan Bridge, and the left flank reached Matang Station. The vanguard was only 30 li from Yuezhou. In the afternoon, reinforcements counterattacked, attempting to recover it, and engaged us in a bloody battle. Over 500 were killed by us, and many were captured. By evening, seeing the × (enemy)'s momentum falter, we continued to pursue them and are currently advancing smoothly.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 12th] On the morning of the 11th, the × (enemy) army in Zengcheng and Conghua launched a fierce attack on Fuhe and Gonghe in Zengcheng in three routes. One route traveled from Taipingchang Dongwenge back to Liangtian Taoying. Our army took advantage of the superior terrain of high mountains and dense forests. The × (enemy) army of over a thousand men was unable to advance. After a fierce battle until 8 p.m., the × (enemy) suffered heavy losses and retreated to Fuhe. Another route of several hundred × (enemy) advanced north from Zhonghe and reinforced over a thousand from Dajing to attack Gonghexu. They engaged in fierce battles with our ambush team. We sent another team to ambush at Dakeng Yangguangkou. After a fierce battle until noon, this route of × (enemy) army was completely routed and fled. Another route of over a thousand × (enemy) advanced from Hemei Jing, northeast of Conghua, to the northwest of Fuhe. After a bloody battle until 4 p.m., all three routes of × (enemy) army were severely beaten and fled. In this battle, the × (enemy) army suffered over 500 casualties, and we seized countless military supplies.

### Large-Scale Elimination of Traitors in Nanjing – Anti-Japanese Elements are Thickly Distributed Around – Many × (enemy) Puppet Leaders Poisoned

[Hai'er News Agency, Shanghai, 12th] According to news from the Japanese side in Nanjing, high-ranking Japanese and puppet officials hosted a banquet to entertain Japanese Vice Minister Shimizu Ryusaburo, but a Chinese person poisoned the wine. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and they immediately had their stomachs pumped by doctors. Now the officials are out of danger. If the poisoning had succeeded, many high-ranking Japanese and puppet officials would have been killed. It is reported that the Japanese side has captured one suspect and is currently interrogating him.

[Chongqing Electricity] Shanghai news, × (enemy) Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shimizu Ryusaburo arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and went to Nanjing. The × (enemy) consulate in Nanjing hosted a welcome banquet at 7 p.m. on the 10th. In addition to the unanimous participation of × (enemy) military and political dignitaries, puppet organization leaders Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, Ren Yuandao, Ma Cheng, and Gao Guanwu were also invited as escorts, totaling over 20 people. During the banquet, the × (enemy) and puppets clinked glasses and exchanged toasts, appearing extremely harmonious. Unexpectedly, a strong poison was secretly placed in the yellow wine they consumed. After the × (enemy) and puppets drank heartily, they immediately became poisoned and fell to the ground. The order was disrupted for a time, and doctors were urgently summoned for treatment. However, because the poisoning was very deep, they were transported to the hospital. × (enemy) side only released the information on the evening of the 11th, saying that the poison in the wine was placed by anti-Japanese elements, and one person has been arrested. The most severely poisoned were Liang Hongzhi and Gao Guanwu. Although it is rumored that senior military and diplomatic personnel of the × (enemy) side were also involved, no names were mentioned.

### Dusk is Vague – Air Battle Over Yu and Rong – × (enemy) Aircraft Were Shot Down by Us – Our Side Suffered Little Damage

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] Yesterday evening after dusk, multiple Japanese bombers raided the cities of Yu (Chongqing) and Rong (Chengdu) within fifteen minutes. Our fighter planes immediately took off to meet them and engaged the × (enemy) aircraft in fierce combat. As the evening glow gradually closed in, the sky was dim, and the light from the searchlights intertwined in the air. The × (enemy) aircraft took advantage of the vague dusk to break into the urban area. However, because our planes were closely chasing, they hastily dropped their bombs and fled in disarray. The × (enemy) aircraft broke into Chongqing at 7:15 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. They also appeared over Chengdu. Chongqing suffered dozens of large bombs. The × (enemy) aircraft dropped their bombs without targeting anything. Chengdu had several incendiary bombs dropped, and several houses caught fire. The number of casualties in both places has not yet been ascertained, but it is believed that it is not very large. The × (enemy) aircraft suffered heavier losses in Chengdu, with three being shot down by our aircraft and falling in the southeastern suburbs. Several large fires in the city were only extinguished by the fire brigade until midnight. The West China University, a British church school outside the South Gate, was directly hit by three bombs. It is reported that two foreign faculty members were injured. When the × (enemy) aircraft broke into the sky over Chongqing, they were fiercely fired upon by our army's anti-aircraft gun team. According to eyewitnesses, two × (enemy) aircraft fell from the sky. Their remains are currently being searched for. The remaining × (enemy) aircraft all fled because our aircraft were chasing them. Our aircraft safely returned only after the × (enemy) aircraft were far away.

### × (enemy) Decides to Encircle the Tianjin Concessions Starting Tomorrow

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 12th] It is reported that the Japanese side has decided to encircle the British and French concessions in Tianjin and has ordered that starting from the 14th, all pedestrians entering and leaving the concessions must be searched by Japanese police before being allowed to pass, except for officials of various countries (including the Japanese and puppet regimes). Also, Japanese Consul General Tashiro in Tianjin will officially issue a notice tomorrow, and at the same time advise Japanese residents in Tianjin not to frequently travel to and from the concessions. It is rumored that the Japanese side has adopted this measure because the British Consul General in Tianjin refused to extradite the assassin in the Cheng case.

× (enemy) Spokesman Makes a Forceful Statement

[Tokyo, 12th] According to the Japanese Domei News Agency, the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman announced today that the British authorities in Tianjin have refused to hand over the assassin of Cheng Xigeng to the Japanese side. The Japanese authorities have decided that they will be forced to take "certain steps" to deal with the new situation arising from this matter. A foreign correspondent requested an explanation of these steps, but the spokesman did not respond, only saying that the British authorities should reconsider their attitude, which is most necessary. Also, according to news from Tianjin, Japanese property in the British and French concessions continues to be moved to areas under Japanese control, but a large amount of goods remain in the concessions. The population of the British concession is 47,000, including 2,700 British citizens. The population of the French concession is 61,000, including 1,000 French citizens. The total population of Tianjin is approximately 1.3 million.

### Japanese × (enemy) Traitors Anti-British and Anti-Communist

[Reuters, Shanghai, 12th] Chinese newspapers under Japanese management here have many anti-British remarks. Although the British Consul General protested on the 10th of this month, demanding suppression of anti-British propaganda, the anti-British tone of the newspapers has not diminished. "Xin Shenbao" criticized recent British-Japanese incidents, saying that Chinese people should resist the British in the "spirit of the May Thirtieth Movement."

[Reuters, Tokyo, 12th] A news agency reported that the "White Russian Anti-Communist Committee" has occupied the Soviet consulate in the former Russian concession in Tianjin and has torn down the Soviet Russian flag, replacing it with the old Russian flag.

### Our Country's Experts Research and Formulate New Diet for Soldiers

Strengthen Soldiers' Physique Improve Combat Efficiency

[Reuters, Shanghai Correspondence] Many of China's current biochemists and human nutrition experts are assisting military authorities in improving the diet of soldiers. In addition, extremely large warehouses have been established to store grain. It is reported that Chinese experts in dietary issues have explored and formulated a new diet for soldiers to strengthen soldiers' physique and improve their combat efficiency. The components of the new diet are rice flour, wheat flour, eggs, animal fat, soybeans, sugar, and salt. After mixing the ingredients, they are made into biscuits, bread, or hardtack, etc., all of which have extremely high nutritional value. Chemists at the Central Industrial Experiment Institute of the National Government are also finding ways to pickle vegetables and plants. It is reported that a total of 55,000 tons are needed annually to supply the warriors at the front. In addition, plans are being made to manufacture a large number of canned foods for military use, so all the major canned food factories in the country are extremely busy.

Brief Comments

### Nanjing's Large-Scale Elimination of Traitors

The puppet leaders of Nanjing held a grand banquet on the evening of the 10th to entertain Japanese Vice Minister Shimizu Ryusaburo, but someone poisoned the wine. Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, Ren Yuandao, Gao Guanwu, and Shimizu all suffered severe poisoning. This major case of eliminating traitors will surely be "widely welcomed" throughout the country!

Regardless of whether the × (enemy) and traitor leaders can survive, we can see from this fact that the occupied areas, and even the close associates of the × (enemy) traitors, are already filled with "Chinese-thinking" elements. This is an even more serious warning to those who willingly dedicate themselves as running dogs to the × (enemy) clique, harming our people and endangering our nation!

In fact, these people who betray the country and are traitors have already been poisoned by the temporary benefits they seek for themselves. As the saying goes, "Though the body still measures, the heart is already dead." Let us wait and see! ×××××××××××××!

× (enemy) Aircraft Bombing Yu and Rong

The × (enemy) are already in an inextricable quagmire in their military aggression against China. They are now stepping up their political offensive, and the renewed crazy bombing of Chongqing and Chengdu is another manifestation of this political offensive.

However, the × (enemy)'s atrocities have clearly failed completely! Not only has it strengthened the determination of China from top to bottom to unite and resist the war, but it also no longer poses any military threat to us and can no longer cause any damage to our rear construction efforts. For example, the bombing of Chongqing on the 9th only resulted in the tragic death of nine civilians. Most of the × (enemy) bombs landed in destroyed areas, causing no loss to our side. The attack on Yu on the 11th was immediately met by our air force, which shot down two aircraft, causing them to flee in panic. On the same day, an attack on Chengdu resulted in three more aircraft being shot down by us. Here we can see even more that the power of the Japanese × (enemy) has reached the "end of its rope"!

### Central Government Plans to Solve the Refugee Problem – Launches Large-Scale Work Relief – Establishes 30,000 Industrial Centers – Mass Reclamation in Twelve Provinces

[Reuters, Shanghai Correspondence] The National Government Relief Committee has launched a large-scale work relief plan in order to completely solve the wartime refugee problem. There are currently 15 million refugees in the country. After the implementation of the above work relief plan, every refugee will have work to do, such as road construction, mining, soap making, agricultural tool manufacturing, and textile production. The Relief Committee has already used 5 million yuan to establish 30,000 industrial centers at the start of the plan, so that millions of refugees will not lose their livelihoods. At the same time, the committee is also preparing to massively reclaim land in twelve provinces, which can reclaim approximately 2 million acres of wasteland, accommodating 15 million refugees so that they can live and work in peace. To date, a total of 50,000 refugees have moved into the reclamation areas in the provinces of Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. If the current colonization plan proceeds smoothly, an even larger group of refugees will be transported to undeveloped areas. In addition, the Relief Committee is considering transferring millions of refugees to remote provinces such as Gansu (Kang) and Xinjiang.

### Fires of War Under Mount Luofu

— Yang Fan

(Special Correspondence for This Newspaper)

Our army is closing in on Zengcheng day by day, only two miles away. The Shitan area is also posing a threat to the × people. If Zengcheng and Shitan are both conquered by our army, the × people in Guangzhou will be under great military threat, and the × people in the northwest of the river will also be greatly affected. Therefore, the × people are panicking and quickly transferring more than a thousand soldiers from Guangzhou to Zengcheng, and also transferring more than eight thousand soldiers from Conghua in the north of the river to encircle and attack Mount Luofu, and to sweep through Zengbo (a part of it). As a result, the tragic scene of the barbaric acts of the × people has unfolded again in Zengbo. However, this has once again added a glorious page to the history of the people's liberation here, who have been tempered in struggle.

1.  Turned into Scorched Earth Under the Frenzied Bombing of × Planes

Wherever the × people attack, they first carry out large-scale bombing by the air force. Of course, this time in attacking Mount Luofu and sweeping through Zengbo, they also dispatched a considerable number of air force planes, which were active in the skies here every day. They dropped many bombs and strafed with machine guns in Lianhe, Futian, Lanshi, Sulou, Mazha, Zhengguo, Paitan... In many places, many buildings had already been burned and destroyed when they fell under enemy control before. This time, however, they thoroughly bombed the buildings that had remained, especially turning Futian and Paitan into scorched earth. More than forty people were sacrificed in Futian, and more than a hundred people were killed or injured in Boluo City at one time.

2.  The Burning, Plundering, and × Killing by × Troops Occupying Villages

The burning, plundering, and × killing by the × troops in the occupied areas is a concrete manifestation of the barbarity of its regressive war. I have heard many times in the past, no, I have seen many times with my own eyes. This time, the × people also carried out such brutal sweeps, setting fire to houses wherever they saw them. Paitan, Zhengguo, Lanxi, Sulou, Lianhe, and Futian, especially Paitan, suffered the most severe burning and killing, because the heroic resistance of the people of Paitan was beyond the expectation of the × people. An ambush annihilated four or five hundred "Imperial Army" soldiers, and we also gloriously sacrificed more than eighty soldiers. Therefore, in Paitan, they burned and killed wherever they went. In other places, they burned hundreds of houses. ×××××, because of the rapid action of the × army, those who could not escape in time were all made comfort women by the imperial army. Food and livestock were, of course, what the × people liked the most as supplies that were not easily accessible to the rear. However, in addition to large-scale burning and massacres, the × people also used a policy of appeasement to deal with the peasants. The people captured in Futian were carefully examined, and if they were considered to be genuine peasants, they would be made to pretend to transplant rice seedlings and eat, and patted on the shoulder to tell them to settle down. Of course, if they had any doubts, the frosty white bayonet would be inserted into the flesh of their chest.

The people on the front line here have been taught by the × people. From the experience and lessons they have received from the × people, they have learned how to deal with the × people. This time, the people swept by the × people in Zengbo (a part of it) generally did the work of strengthening the walls and clearing the fields, but it was not thorough. This is because experience tells them that the × people do not occupy them for a long time, and the × people will retreat after a while. Therefore, their work is limited to the scope of this "experience." Next time, it is hoped that they can understand the overall situation and do effective work, and if necessary, poison the wells and fill the wells. In terms of mass mobilization, some villages can do this: 1. The × people come and sound the gongs to warn; 2. Young people gather and armed forces gather to go up the mountain; 3. The old and young go to a safe place to hide. Of course, they take their belongings with them. They have attacked ×× people many times, but because their organization is not sound, the previous few times have only played a small role.

3.  The Heroic Victory of the People of Paitan

In particular, the heroic and victorious struggle of the people of Paitan this time will make the × people realize the great strength of our people, and can serve as a model for the people to resist Japan. In the past, when the × people first arrived in Paitan, the people of Paitan did not realize what it meant to resist Japan. Many people presented gifts to welcome the imperial army, but the imperial army's response was a round of machine gun fire. As a result, the people of Paitan received a good lesson. This time, the people of Paitan recognized the × people themselves and held a general meeting of the whole village in advance, resolving that all young people with weapons, regardless of the quality of the weapons, should concentrate on attacking the × people, and those who did not go would be executed internally first. Therefore, they concentrated hundreds of guns and, relying on the favorable terrain, ambushed more than 8,000 × people. The × army suffered four or five hundred casualties, and the people of Paitan also gloriously sacrificed more than eighty (killed or wounded). The blood of these more than eighty national heroes will, of course, irrigate the flowers of the people's liberation even more vigorously!

4.  Taoist Zhao of Mount Luofu Still Wants to Take Up a Gun and Fight

When the ×× army broke through the Sulou Cave on Mount Luofu, the Taoists of the Sulou Temple could not avoid the imperial army giving them a good visit. Taoist Zhao also wanted to take up a gun and fight. Taoist Zhao is very fat, with a large belly and a ruddy face, and is in his forties or fifties. His left leg is lame. The reporter talked with him when he went to the Sulou Temple last time. He knew the ways of the world very well. At that time, he knew that he was a passive person who had experienced the vicissitudes of life. This time, the reporter met him at the Sulou Temple, but he did not have the same passive attitude as the Taoist he had previously had. As soon as he started talking, he said indignantly: "I, Zhao Shulin, have been in the Sulou Temple for more than ten years, quietly recuperating in my old age, because I have seen through the 'world'. In the past, I was a secretary in the army, and later I became a battalion commander. As a battalion commander, I was even more dissatisfied with doing many things, so I brought a little money I had earned and came to Mount Luofu to cultivate Taoism. A thousand silver dollars were invested by my family in a business in Mazha Market, but now the store has been burned down, the money is gone, and the forty dollars in my pocket have also been snatched away by the Japanese devils." At this time, he spoke very brightly and urgently, slamming his crutch hard on the floor, causing echoes all around. "You think that if the country is in danger, Taoists can't do it either. I still want to take up a gun and fight." His face became even redder, and the blue veins on both sides of his forehead were throbbing. He was holding his crutch tightly, and the crutch was trembling there.

"If the country is in danger, no one can live. Everyone must take up a gun and fight," the reporter added to his sentence.

5.  The Lives of the People After the Robbery

The lives of the people after the robbery are the most serious problem. Their houses and property are burned and looted every time. After the robbery, they have nothing left and have to endure hunger and cold. Now most of their houses are covered with thatched grass or one or two pieces of bamboo on top of the burned houses, which become their residences. If it rains heavily, the two cracked walls will be moistened by the rain, and everyone will be worried that they will become ghosts crushed to death under these two walls at any time. Eating is also so difficult. As long as they don't starve, it's considered good to have sweet potatoes to eat. A little richer, they only have sweet potato porridge. The reporter saw with his own eyes a family eating. The child picked up a sweet potato and said, "Mom, I don't want sweet potatoes." "If you don't eat sweet potatoes, what will you eat?" The father's stern instruction made the child's hand loosen, and the sweet potato fell to the ground. His eyes stared at his father, and he cried with his mouth wide open. In short, their lives are so hungry and cold, and they can't even get through the minimum.

Now the × people have retreated, leaving behind "hatred" and the still majestic and great natural scenery of Mount Luofu. "Hatred" will turn into a great fire that burns through the wilderness, burning to death that fierce beast. I also wish Mount Luofu to be transformed into a great tomb to bury the × people in the future.

### Jerusalem in the National Revolutionary War

— Ye Juesun

Special Correspondence for This Newspaper (Part 1)

×× Road

Mount Heng (Nanyue) has always been one of the five famous mountains in China, and it used to be very popular for pilgrimage. On the mountain, there is a magnificent Great Hero Hall that occupies hundreds of acres, and its splendor is no less than that of the imperial palace. The beams and pillars are carved with dragons, phoenixes, and patterns. According to the locals, the men and women who came to worship Buddha often followed one after another for dozens of miles without end. However, as far as the current situation is concerned, everything has completely changed. Following the mountains, Mount Heng will also become a scenic spot in modern history. Chairman Chiang's entire analysis of the war situation in the ×× Conference is even more epoch-making in the history of national revolution. On April 26, the reporter left Changsha and took a provincial government car to ××. The purpose of this trip was of course to meet the new fighters of the national liberation war who are being tempered, and the guerrilla cadre training class that is shining the highest degree of glory in the history of military education. As Mr. Bai Chongxi said, guerrilla warfare is the best way to concretely realize total warfare. His intention to establish a cadre training class is naturally to strengthen the guerrilla forces in terms of quality, and to maximize the function of guerrilla tactics to achieve the transformation of the × people's rear into the front line, accumulating small victories into big victories, and carrying out the so-called military, political, economic, and cultural all-round counter-offensive.

From Changsha to Hengshan via Xiangtan, the road is flat and the highway is very good. Because our car broke down in the middle of the road, we arrived at ×× very late. Although this place is only a small town with four or five hundred families, there are not a few people coming and going. We accidentally met Mr. Chen Lie somewhere. He is the director of the political department of the cadre training class. He is not tall, but his strong and solid appearance shows the prestige of annihilating the enemy in front of Jigong Mountain. Meeting him eliminated all the trouble of roundabout communication, so I entrusted him to deliver a letter of introduction to Tang Enbo, the director of education.

At more than five o'clock in the morning, a general who was once called the Iron Man jumped out of a command car in front of the guest house. This was Tang Enbo, with a very cheerful expression and earnest and heroic speech. In terms of appearance, he has the flavor of a modern Zhang Fei. Mr. and Mrs. Li Meng said: "Judging from the attitude and movements alone, we would suspect that General Tang is the younger brother of Mr. Li Zongren, because you have many things in common." This sentence caused us to laugh for a while. In fact, since the Battle of Taierzhuang, Li Tang has always been an old partner who has cooperated consistently and rarely separated. This is just like the opera of Mei Lanfang, if it is not matched with the erhu of Wang Shaoqing, it will inevitably reduce the taste. If there is Li Zongren without Tang Enbo, it seems that it is still not lively enough on the battlefield. We cannot fail to acknowledge that this unprecedented victory in northern Hubei was exchanged for national glory by the flesh and blood of thousands of brothers and the wise and courageous command of Li Tang. Time passed quickly with the trembling of every mouth. Thirty minutes later, we sent Mr. Tang out of the gate of the guest house. At this time, the setting sun was shining on the tips of the weeping willows, and the road on Mount Heng presented a golden color, and the scenery was infinitely lovely.

The Flying Army on ×× Ridge

Because of the hard journey yesterday, I woke up this morning to see the red sun filling the window, it was about eight o'clock. Just after washing up, the waiter came in and said, "A Mr. Deng is visiting." Then I stepped out of the room. Mr. Deng handed me a card from Mr. Tang Enbo, saying that he was inviting us to go up the mountain. While collecting my luggage, I began to chat with this young brother. First of all, I thought to myself that this Mr. Deng was at most an adjutant of Tang's headquarters. This impression was woven from the two conditions of age and clothing. However, it is not appropriate to judge people by their appearance. Mr. Deng is the deputy commander of the cadre training class, and he is also a major general. The so-called soldiers' lives can be said to have been concretely manifested here.

I, Mr. Deng, and Mr. and Mrs. Li Meng, a group of four people, squeezed into a small car, shoulder to shoulder, and sped through the curtains woven by the willow branches on the side of the road. At every corner of the road, there is a portrait of Chairman Chiang, painted on a snow-white wooden board, which makes people feel solemn and respectful. On the stone walls on both sides of the mountainside, there are many slogans written, and the central meaning is of course about guerrilla tactics.

Several bursts of singing came from the pine forest, "We are all flying troops, no matter how high the mountains and how deep the water are." Deputy Commander Deng told us that this was the students doing field exercises. Everywhere is a lecture hall, everywhere is a playground, life is tense and happy, hard and exciting, really a group of young and strong flying troops.

Commander Chen ×× is also a very young figure. He is the commander of the ×× Division and has also made many achievements in the War of Resistance Against Japan. He led us to visit all parts of the school. There are several points that are particularly noteworthy: (1) There is a lecture platform and a blackboard in the dining room, which means that one thing is used for two purposes. When the dining room can also be used as a meeting place, and if there is something that needs to be discussed between students, it can be raised immediately for democratic discussion. (2) Wall newspapers are very common here, and each team has one. The content and layout are very rich and tidy. There are poems and cartoons. (3) The internal affairs are very tidy. Although the school buildings and all material conditions here are not as good as those of military academies or aviation schools, the attention to internal affairs and the performance of achievements are by no means worse than the former. The sheets are folded into squares like tofu. (4) There is a forum for opinions and discussions on daily life or teachers' teaching methods. Some even draw their own opinions into simple patterns, and the way they are expressed is very vivid and the meaning is very profound. There are many gunshots on the shooting range. It is said that the girls are practicing shooting. Mrs. Li Meng was very excited when she heard it. We went around the classroom, went out of the side door, and went to the shooting range to watch the women's army drill. Sure enough, there were two machine guns lined up on the field, and a dozen girls took turns shooting. These are all modern Hua Mulan, female flying soldiers, and strong machine gunners.

### Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Will Likely Continue Soon, It Is Said That the British Representative Left for the Soviet Union Yesterday, French Cabinet Meets to Discuss the International Situation

(Haitong News Agency, London, December 12) Sterndale Bennett, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, took a plane from London to Warsaw on Sunday afternoon, then took a train to Moscow.

(Haitong News Agency, Paris, December 12) According to German diplomatic circles, the United Kingdom will send Sterndale Bennett, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, as a special envoy to Moscow, with special authority, authorized by Foreign Secretary Halifax, to discuss new proposals from the British and French governments with the Soviet Union, and has the right to modify them, but on the premise that they do not violate the policies of the British and French governments.

(Haitong News Agency, London, December 12) According to the "Evening Standard," the British government has notified the French and Soviet sides that Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech on Thursday was aimed at the Germans, and its purpose was to counter propaganda and explain that the United Kingdom did not intend to implement a policy of encirclement. The British government has stated to Paris that it will not adopt new policies or intend to make concessions to authoritarian countries.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, December 12] The French cabinet held a meeting this morning, chaired by President Lebrun. Foreign Minister Bonnet gave a broad discussion of the foreign political situation, with particular emphasis on the dispatch of Sterndale Bennett, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, to the Soviet Union. Paris said that Sterndale Bennett carried the latest British proposals and the same French proposals, which will be submitted to the Soviet government. Therefore, Sterndale Bennett is also a representative of both the United Kingdom and France. Foreign Minister Bonnet's earlier explanation of the need to conclude a Turkish-French agreement will also be explained. According to well-informed sources, Foreign Minister Bonnet may formally announce on Monday morning that the Turkish-French draft treaty has been signed. Other issues for discussion include French-Italian relations, the Pope's promotion of the peace movement, and the problem of Syrian refugees in France.

[Haitong News Agency, London, December 12] The debate on foreign political affairs in the House of Lords will continue on Monday. Foreign Secretary Halifax will defend his recent "peace" speech, because opposition figures believe that the speech indicated that the United Kingdom was preparing to hold negotiations with the Axis countries and condemned it. On Monday morning, the London newspapers expressed doubt about whether the government would re-implement a "policy of appeasement." The "Daily Telegraph" defended the government's attitude and hoped that the German-language broadcast messages from London could make the Germans deeply aware that although the United Kingdom is prepared to negotiate, it will still firmly fulfill its obligations that it has already promised.

[Haitong News Agency, London, December 11] There are no new news reports in the weekly newspapers here about the dispatch of Sterndale Bennett, Head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, to the Soviet Union. However, according to a report published in the "Times" on Sunday, if the results of Sterndale Bennett's trip to the Soviet Union are not as expected, another cabinet member will be sent to Moscow with a mandate. The newspaper did not mention who the candidate was. The newspaper believes that the attitude of the Baltic countries to refuse other countries to provide them with guarantees is currently the most difficult problem to solve. The newspaper also said that Sterndale Bennett will propose to the Soviet government a new plan for automatic cooperation between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union in the event of a direct or indirect attack. The new plan stipulates that in the event of an invasion, the three countries will immediately consult in order to take joint action.

[Reuters, Rome, December 11] Roman newspapers, in addition to expressing their satisfaction with the speeches made by Chamberlain and Halifax, said that what is now expected is proof of the United Kingdom's good intentions. Dada wrote in "The Italian Voice" that "the speeches of the British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary make us feel confused. Although their words are very pleasant to hear, the development of the facts is still very different from the spirit of their words." "Il Messaggero," the mouthpiece of Foreign Minister Ciano, said, "We believe in the sincerity and good intentions of the British Prime Minister and Halifax, but if they really want to achieve the convening of a group meeting, then they must express 'I am prepared to negotiate' without involving anything else."

### Turkish-Romanian Rapprochement, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu to Visit Turkey, Will Discuss Balkan Issues

[Central News Agency, Turkish Capital, December 11] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, accompanied by his wife, came to make an official visit, arriving here at 9:10 a.m. on the 11th. Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu personally welcomed him at the station. Gafencu said in a statement to a newspaper that he firmly believes that Yugoslavia will always abide by the Balkan Entente and will be able to take into account both the interests of the Balkan Peninsula and European peace. According to reports, Yugoslavia had expressed dissatisfaction with Turkey's signing of a mutual assistance agreement with the United Kingdom, accusing it of undermining the Balkan Entente.

### British King Leaves America, American Visit Completed, Returned to Canada Yesterday with the Queen

[Reuters, Hyde Park, New York, December 12] The British King and Queen left here for Canada at 2 a.m. this morning (standard time). President and Mrs. Roosevelt personally saw them off at the station.

[Central News Agency, Hyde Park, New York, December 12] The British King and Queen went to the English church in Hyde Park yesterday morning to pray on Sunday. There were many spectators standing outside the church. The normally very quiet Hyde Park suddenly became bustling. After the service, the British King and Queen had a picnic nearby and rested in the field in the afternoon without any social events.

[Reuters, Hyde Park, America, December 11] Hyde Park Village, originally a quiet village, has become a center of crowds today due to the arrival of the British King and Queen. The welcoming crowds began to gather outside the village church from midnight. By 3 a.m. (local time), the number of people gathered was already very large. President and Mrs. Roosevelt accompanied the two Majesties to attend Holy Communion at the church this morning, presided over by Bishop Strider, the head of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Bishop Strider's position in the United States is equivalent to that of the Archbishop of Canterbury in the United Kingdom. Bishop Strider said, "The countries that are holding Holy Communion here today have an impact on the world situation that is far beyond ordinary. Perhaps for this reason, they must bear the greatest responsibility to save the world from the depths of fire and water." President Roosevelt knew that the two Majesties had been through a heavy round of social events in the past three days and needed to rest, so after holding a picnic together, he allowed the two Majesties to spend the afternoon at will.

### Danzig Nazis Indiscriminately Arrest Polish Customs Officials, Polish Authorities Are Investigating

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, December 11] Another incident has occurred between Poland and the Free City of Danzig. Li Dingski, a Polish customs official of the Danzig City Customs, was recently arrested by the Danzig authorities on suspicion of espionage, but the Polish High Commissioner, Chodacki, was not notified. Later, Chodacki discovered that Li Dingski was missing and inquired with the city council before learning about the matter. However, the place of detention has not yet been ascertained. The Polish authorities are investigating.

### Hitler Has a Conspiracy

Nazi dignitaries fly to Hungary to win support; Military preparations reveal unabated desire for war

Rumors of a formal announcement to annex Czechoslovakia

[Central News Agency, Budapest, Hungary, 10th] German Interior Minister Frick visited Hungary, staying for five days. He returned to Germany this afternoon with his wife. During his stay, he reportedly discussed with Hungarian government officials the issue of the German minority in Hungary and ways to enhance cooperation between Germany and Hungary. Of particular importance was the cooperation between the two countries' police authorities to suppress Communist activities. Other issues discussed included the transfer of Jews out of the country, the reception of political exiles, and the signing of a press agreement. It is also reported that Dietrich, the head of the information department of the German Foreign Ministry, will arrive here next week, and Schirach, the leader of the Nazi Youth League, arrived here from Romania at 9:00 PM today and will return to Berlin tomorrow. When speaking to reporters, he claimed that this visit was a private trip.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 11th] Local newspapers recently reported that Germany is about to end its protection policy over Bohemia and Moravia in Czechoslovakia and annex these provinces directly into German territory. The newspaper of the Radical Socialist Party stated that the annexation date will be before the 15th of this month, at which time these provinces will become German provinces and be directly administered by the German central government. Czech cultural autonomy will cease from then on. The current Czech courts will no longer exist, and all officials will be replaced by Germans. Secondly, the independent state of Slovakia will also suffer the same fate. Foreign observers in Berlin have already submitted reports to their respective governments.

[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] According to Todt, a German engineer and consultant for the Siegfried Line, Hitler ordered the strengthening of the "Third Line of Defense" between Aix-la-Chapelle and Saarbrücken last October. This project has now been completed. Todt also said that this new defensive工事 extends west of the Siegfried Line, connecting Aix-la-Chapelle and Saarbrücken, while the previous two defensive lines were built on the east side. Todt further said, "The new defensive line is specially equipped with heavy military equipment, and strong fortifications have been added, especially between Saarbrücken and Basel."

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th] The German military authorities built a new line of defense west of the Aachen-Saarbrücken highway (in the southern Saar region) last October to strengthen the defense of western Germany between Aachen and Saarbrücken. The old two lines of defense are east of the highway. According to German newspapers, the defensive strength of the new line of defense is extremely strong. The fortifications have also been increased from Saarbrücken to Basel. The most solid defensive line in Germany at present is the Siegfried Line, which faces France's most solid Maginot Line.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 11th] Germany is actively expanding its military preparations and building defensive fortifications on both its eastern and western borders, employing a large number of workers. As a result, there is a severe shortage of labor in various industries. The government authorities have rehired Jewish people who were forced to give up their jobs to supplement the workforce. Many of these Jews are lawyers, doctors, businessmen, and cultural figures. They are now demolishing old buildings in certain areas according to a plan set by Berlin. One worker, formerly a lawyer, reportedly said that this work is not compulsory, but Jews who are willing to be employed are easily accepted. Some intellectuals felt tired in the early stages of work, but after a while, they became accustomed to it. Supervisors in various factories all agree that Jews are good workers. Our wages average one mark and ten pfennigs per hour, and we work an average of eight hours per day. There is occasional overtime work, which is also paid by the hour. Workers with wives and children receive additional subsidies. In short, although our situation is not ideal, it is better to work hard than to be idle all day or suffer other fates. Whether this is commensurate with our former status is not considered.

### Ciano to Visit Spain

[Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 11th] Italian political circles have rumored that Foreign Minister Ciano will visit Spain during the day. Local newspapers have now confirmed this, stating that the Spanish Interior Minister Suner, who is currently visiting Italy, invited Ciano to visit Spain, and Ciano has accepted his invitation.

### Britain Also Expands Military; Steps Up Aircraft Production to Resist Germany and Italy; Local Army Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiments Also Enlist

[Haitong News Agency, London, 12th] The 'Daily Telegraph' announced today that Britain can now produce 750 aircraft per month and hopes to increase this to 1,000 aircraft per month after March. Compared with the air force strength of authoritarian countries (especially the German Air Force), the British and French air forces cannot achieve a balance of air power in the West. The heads of the German and Italian air forces are cooperating to discuss detailed plans. The good organization of the air forces of the two countries and the development of the aircraft industry enable the Axis powers to gain air superiority. Since Britain and France cannot compare with Germany and Italy, they should cooperate closely with the air forces of the Soviet Union and Poland.

[Reuters, London, 11th] The first anti-aircraft artillery regiment of the local army was called up for active duty today in accordance with the Reserve Forces Assistance Act, for a period of one month. Other anti-aircraft artillery regiments will also be called up in rotation, with a term of one month.

### British People's Front Aborted

[Reuters, London, 11th] The joint conference of various committees intending to organize a people's front in Britain decided to announce that the people's front was difficult to realize after listening to Mr. Cripps' report today, so it terminated this movement and disbanded the local committees.

### European Situation

— Uncle Kang

—Special Correspondent of this Newspaper in London—(Middle)

——Negotiations in the Soviet Union——British-German Relations——Britain and France vs. Germany and Italy——Struggle for Spain——Hesitation of the Balkans——British-Turkish Treaty——Greece——Romania——Yugoslavia——

Now, please everyone open a map of Europe. At the westernmost end of the Mediterranean Sea, the only hole leading into the sea is the world-famous Strait of Gibraltar, and at the easternmost end is the Suez Canal, which connects to the Red Sea. Everyone knows that this is the greatest lifeline of maritime transport for Britain and France, but at the same time, everyone also knows that this is the only most basic base for Germany and Italy to develop their dream empire.

In the reporter's previous dispatch, I pointed out some recent military preparations and political conspiracies of Germany and Italy in Africa. The African part referred to there is located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. Naturally, those preparations and conspiracies have not stopped recently, but are intensifying. However, there have been no noteworthy new developments. What is now attracting our attention is at both ends of the Mediterranean Sea: the shift in the situation in Spain at the western end, and the hesitant crossroads of the Balkan countries at the eastern end. To put it simply, it is the increasing pressure from Germany and Italy.

The Situation in Spain

Recently, there have been two noteworthy events: First, the sudden departure of the German fleet; and second, Goring's planned trip to Spain, which was suddenly canceled. These indicate that there is a problem with the process of Germany and Italy exerting pressure on Franco to make him a completely obedient slave.

Of course, Franco is still a slave in the end, but the problem, although not big, still exists.

What is the problem? Everyone knows that Franco has already accepted the pressure from Germany and Italy and joined the "Anti-Comintern Pact"; and he has dedicated almost all of his land to the strategists of Germany and Italy as a base for their future war against Britain and France, making advance arrangements. However, there is one thing that he has not accepted until now: On the day of the official celebration of the victory of the civil war, he should explicitly propose to Britain the recovery of lost territory—the British-owned Gibraltar military port in the Strait of Gibraltar. Franco has always refused this because he has never given up the idea of ​​borrowing money from Britain and France. As a result, the date of celebrating the victory has been postponed again and again; and correspondingly, the issue of Germany and Italy withdrawing volunteer soldiers, which Britain and France are most concerned about, has also been unyielding.

This stalemate suddenly brewed two very serious crises involving internal and foreign affairs. Based on Germany's background, the leader of the most reactionary fascist faction in Spain, the current Interior Minister Suner, recently exposed a political conspiracy to replace Franco. This made Franco very unhappy with Germany. So, as a kind of demonstration, on the one hand, he asked Germany and Italy in writing to first show him where they are superior to the British and French armies; otherwise, he is unwilling to publicly oppose Britain. On the other hand, he said to the British ambassador that, in fact, he would eventually break up with Germany and Italy, but "the time has not yet matured." If this situation continues to develop, it is possible that the forces of international struggle will use the stage of Spain to have another civil war, unless Franco completely succumbs or is completely overthrown. At the same time, in Spain under Franco's rule, the old forces of the former government army are lurking here and there, waiting for the opportunity to reappear. This is the first crisis at present. On one occasion, in order to thoroughly eliminate the possibility of British financial forces entering Spain, the German ambassador to Spain suddenly received an order. Based on this, he warned Franco that March, Franco's largest financial supporter, who is generally considered to have too much pro-British sentiment, must be removed immediately. However, Franco refused. So, this has now created another tension between Germany and Italy and Franco, becoming the second crisis.

Editorial

### The Seriousness of the Tianjin Situation and Britain

Recent news from various sources reports the serious situation of Japanese harassment of the British and French concessions in Tianjin. The threat from Japan to the British concession is particularly severe. Economic blockade has already been implemented several days ago. The French concession has also been affected. It is said that all kinds of goods except daily necessities are not allowed to be imported or exported to the two concessions, and merchant ships cannot dock at the wharves of the two concessions. Last night, foreign news even reported that Japanese nationals in the British and French concessions had been successively moved back to the Japanese concession, and the Japanese staff of the Tianjin branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank and the foreign exchange bureau of the puppet United Bank also moved out of the British and French concessions on the 11th. External rumors say that the Japanese side will blockade the British and French concessions within days, which is a serious situation unprecedented before. However, the Japanese side's intentions should be deeply understood.

Whether in South China or North China, the Japanese side's offensive against Britain has not gone beyond the style of threats and inducements. However, recently, seeing the hesitation and weakness of the British attitude in Europe or the Far East, the methods have become more vicious. The waves of the Tianjin concessions are one example. What the Japanese side requires from Britain is still: to abandon active assistance to China, to comply with Japan's harsh demands, and even to help it suppress our country's anti-Japanese actions. The Japanese side also often hypocritically proclaims: If Britain can adapt to the Japanese side's demands, then Japan can respect British rights and interests in China. But this is very obviously a deception. It must be known that the ultimate goal of Japan is to "build the so-called New Order in East Asia," in other words, to exclusively occupy the entire East Asia to fulfill the ambition of the "theory of dividing the world into three parts" advocated by people in its government. Its desire to exclusively occupy the entire territory of China goes without saying. ×××××××××××××××××××.

Today, when Japan's strength is still insufficient to resist Britain, or to cover the entire territory of China, it may still play tricks, using part of its rights and interests to induce Britain to make concessions, that is, to release part of its rights and interests to exchange for another part, or to tempt Britain to suppress our country's anti-Japanese actions with certain conditions. But it must be known: Japan's method is indeed a means of defeating each one separately. Weakening the anti-Japanese forces in China by one point also reduces the protection of British rights and interests in China by one layer. Some British people may inevitably harbor some illusions, but its ultimate interests must be closely considered.

The Japanese side's offensive against Britain is on the one hand responding to Germany and Italy, and on the other hand alienating Britain and the Soviet Union. The former serves as a gift for not joining the German-Italian military alliance, and the latter is used to deceive Britain. In this wave in Tianjin, it was no coincidence that the Japanese side used the 'White Russian Anti-Communist Committee' to occupy the Soviet consulate in the Russian concession in Tianjin. Chamberlain's and Halifax's speeches yesterday, softening their attitude toward aggressors, are enough to fuel this trend. Japanese news agencies are expanding their publicity, claiming that they will take "practical actions" against foreign concessions in Tianjin within one or two days. This is just as the Manchester Guardian commented: "Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy of appeasement has made Japanese leaders believe that they can drive British forces out of China by threats."

For the current plan, Britain should adopt a tough attitude, effectively resist the invaders, and jointly act with the United States and the Soviet Union. The rights and interests of France and the United States in China are also threatened and harmed in the same way as Britain. Although Japan is slightly polite to the United States, its actual harm is no different. The Soviet Union is even more willing to cooperate with Britain. If Chamberlain believes that delaying the conclusion of the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, then it is just as the Manchester Guardian commented above: "It is a big mistake and a terrible mistake."

### British Newspapers Discuss British Far East Policy

The level of assistance to China is far less than that of Germany and the United States; allowing Japan to invade is a big mistake

[Reuters, London, 12th] The Manchester Guardian commented, "Seeking the reason why Japan must openly provoke a rupture between Britain and Japan, if possible, no one can admit that Japan's determination clearly wants this. The extent of British assistance to China is not only less than that of Germany, but also not seen to be slightly more than that of the United States. However, Japan must be against Britain alone because of old grievances or other reasons, or because it thinks Britain is deceitful and cites Britain as a scapegoat for Japan's failure. Whether Japan wants to slightly comfort Germany's desire by refusing to participate in the Three-Power Military Agreement and using this kind of provocative behavior, or whether Prime Minister Chamberlain's appeasement policy has made Japanese leaders believe that they can drive British forces out of China by threats, this should be stopped at this time. The Japanese government should bear its blame and should be warned, stating what will happen if it continues this policy. The interests of the United States and France in China are also trampled by the Japanese in the same way. The British government should immediately consult with the governments of the United States and France on countermeasures. To allow the Far East to be任由侵略 as the price for maintaining neutrality in European disputes is a big mistake. The covenant can be abandoned, but Japan is in the Far East, not in Europe."

### Husband Wasteland

— Ji Yun

John

Men Under Heaven are Generally Stupid

I divorced John.

It's really strange. Don't look at John with his six-foot figure and full muscles, but he always can't get rid of that sissy. I didn't feel it at first, but after two years of marriage, I saw it.

Once, he lost his job, but I happened to find a job that could bring in some income to support the family. Guess what? John honestly became a housekeeper and did trivial cooking at home. Every day he always said that he would definitely go out to find a job tomorrow; however, tomorrow was甲天, he was still squatting at home.

So, I realized that our marriage was a mistake; I simply couldn't be his virtuous wife; what he needed was an extremely feminine and delicate woman. In this way, he would have to go out and find a way out himself.

Taylor

Not long after my divorce, I met Taylor, a romantic figure. He is the director of a large company. From the beginning, he was very attentive to me, taking me to nightclubs and theaters every day, and constantly sending me flowers and gifts.

Naturally, I was also moved. However, soon after, I realized that Taylor was an extremely self-righteous person, completely different from John.

Taylor was extremely particular about his clothes and gave small accounts in a particularly close manner. In the elevator, if anyone bothered him, he would never give up; in the restaurant, he was even more nitpicking and critical. In his mind, except for him, no one in the world was good. The salesmen under him were idiots, and his superiors were fools.

Taylor is his mother's only son, so naturally he was spoiled. It was very clear that if you want to marry him, you must praise him like a god all day long.

Arthur

Every woman will meet a man like Arthur. He is a senior战员 in a large construction company, and the company relies on him very much. Our friendship progressed slowly, but as I gradually became familiar with him, I admired him more and more.

Arthur is very knowledgeable and speaks eloquently. The only problem is that he lacks a little courage to express his feelings.

He already loved me very much, but he didn't say it, letting time slowly express it. He was a bit indecisive. When we went out to play, this or that, he always asked me.

For other women, such a husband may be very suitable. But I don't want a husband who wholeheartedly serves me.

Robert

I met Robert at a banquet. He is a likable young man, only twenty-one years old, who just came out of college, holding a strong desire to conquer the world. He quickly fell in love with me and asked to marry me. "I am the only woman in the world."

I also liked him very much, but I am six years older than him! In terms of experience, I may be twenty years older than him. I felt that he was looking for a mother, not a wife.

Robert lost his mother early and was raised by two aunts. He had never tasted motherly love, and now he needed a mother.

Harold

Soon after, I met Harold. He is a nervous person who has tried every profession in the thirty-six trades. He often meditates, inventing something to make millions of dollars, but he still lives in a simple house.

Although he doesn't make a fortune, he spends money lavishly, spending as much as he has, without any stinginess.

When his interest in invention diminished, he became very passionate about me. I was again "the first woman in the world." He said that if I refused to marry him, he would commit suicide. I refused, and he drank alcohol for two weeks and then became interested in something else.

I think there is no hope. Men Under Heaven are all like this, who should I marry?

A bad woman's love harms a man, a good woman's love harms herself—French female writer George Sand

### Tidbits

Someone hired a cook who was extremely skilled at skimming oil. No matter what dish he made, he always had to skim some oil to his satisfaction. Although the owner knew, he could not think of any way to solve it. One day, the owner personally bought half a catty of braised pork, and then personally cut it open and carefully counted it, a total of thirty-two pieces, and then sent it to the kitchen to add soy sauce. He thought to himself that in this way, there would probably be no more problems. Later, when it was served on the table, the number was counted, no more and no less, still thirty-two pieces, but the amount was greatly reduced. Each piece had been cut a little by the cook. In addition to 感叹, he wrote a poem to record the matter. The poem says:

Sent out thirty-two soldiers, received sixteen pairs;

Counting soldiers, there are no fewer, but each one is injured.

"Can you answer a few questions for me? We are soliciting public opinions."

### Weather Bureau

Today's weather, the Hong Kong Observatory's forecast is: southwest wind, moderate, dense clouds, occasional showers, everything is the same as yesterday, nothing to say.

People say that Hong Kong has three many: teapots, mahjong tiles, and escort girls. I think in addition to these, robbers robbing people and city tigers hurting people are not few either. If you don't believe it, watch the daily newspapers, there is not a day without them. Yesterday came good news, the authorities "加　police authority, can arbitrarily shoot thieves, it is not bad. But, this is bolting the stable door after the horse is stolen. We always hope for some positive prevention methods. City tigers hurting people also have some development, yesterday an American also became a wronged ghost under the wheels.

### One Person a Day

— Han Fuqu

Han Qingtian, this figure who yearned for 18th-century political theories and techniques, dreamed of the Bao Longtu quartet: private visits to understand the people's suffering, night trials of bandits, beheadings for public display, and great satisfaction to the people. However, he was also unwilling to lag behind in "new methods." Taking "giving speeches" as an example, he enjoyed it tirelessly. In addition to the weekly Monday memorial service, which was a guaranteed performance, he would seize any opportunity to showcase his talent. Although Qingtian did not recognize many characters, each speech was carefully written by Secretary Bei: the characters had to be upright, large, and easily understood by the masses. If, by chance, one-sixth or one-seventh of the characters were beyond Qingtian's vocabulary, one had to admire Qingtian's effort in learning from his secretary, painstakingly memorizing them.

Once, at a joint school sports meet in Jinan, how could Qingtian not go to give a speech? While he was on stage diligently reciting the speech, the wind sprite played a prank and blew the manuscript away. Qingtian was greatly flustered: "Damn it, the wind... Zhao Desheng, chase the speech!" However, the wind was truly strong that day, and Zhao Desheng chased it for quite a while, at least three minutes. He brought a piece of paper back to the stage, but Qingtian saw that it was not right. It was about the 100-meter preliminary race, group exercises, and other such programs. Qingtian angrily shouted, "Damn it! Damn it! This Chairman... is finished!"

### Maritime Storms

— Written by Captain Lao Yang, Translated by Yang Zhao

Previous extract: The fast ship "Kairon Zephei," sailing the Germany-America route, was carrying six million gold bars to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator for the Chux Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, were also on board to travel in Europe. On the ship, they encountered the French aviator Roumong Garo, a man they had saved before...

"It's him. But what is he doing here? I thought he was organizing the air force in France."

Before long, they were warmly shaking hands with the short French man. He gestured a lot, twisting his mustache, expressing how happy he was to meet these two brave children who had saved his life.

"We really didn't expect to meet you," Jack said. "We didn't know you were in America."

The little Frenchman shrugged and secretly glanced around. He said in a very secretive whisper:

"No one knows I'm here except my government."

"Are you on some secret mission?" Jack asked.

"If I told you what I'm doing in America, would you keep it a secret for me?"

"Of course, but if you don't want to—I'm not trying to pry," Jack quickly said.

"That's good, my friends!" Roumong Garo said. "You saved my life, and I would be ungrateful if I kept it from you. I came to America to buy and transport airplanes for France."

"But I thought France already had a very adequate air force," Bill said.

"We have needed more planes for a long time," he said. "I hope we can double it again, but for now, I can't say more. I advise you to listen to the wireless more! Are you here for a vacation?"

"Exactly, I think we should have a happy holiday," Jack said.

The Frenchman answered with a shrug and a smile.

"Your holiday is probably just what you Americans call a 'pipe dream,'" he said, the two young men puzzled by his meaningful words.

2. War Declared

"Well, Jack Red, do you really like watching me work?"

The speaker was Hayes Balfour, a blond, red-cheeked wireless operator on the "Kairon Zephei." On the third afternoon after the ship set sail, Jack discovered that he had met Hayes Balfour before, and they rekindled their friendship. Balfour's greatest pleasure was that on the first day the ship set sail, the German wireless operator's machine had a slight malfunction, which Jack fortunately helped him repair.

Since then, Jack had spent most of his time in the wireless room, ostensibly, as Balfour said, "watching me work." In fact, in addition to his original interest in wireless, there was another thing that made him want to stay in the "Kairon Zephei" wireless room all day long.

### Domestic Tea Allowed to Ship to Shanghai - Lan and Wheat Successively Appear - Jiangsu-Zhejiang Spring Cocoon Harvest Blocked from Shipping to Shanghai - First Batch of 100 Bags of Wheat Arrives in Shanghai

Tea, spring cocoons, and wheat from all over the country are successively entering the market. Merchants are raising funds to purchase them separately. Tea, in addition to domestic sales, is being gathered for export. Jiangsu and Zhejiang spring cocoons are being blocked from shipping to Shanghai. The first batch of wheat has arrived in Shanghai. Banks and firms are providing loans for tea, orchids, and wheat, except in the occupied areas, still according to regular loan practices. Details are as follows:

Tea: After the new tea from Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hubei, and other provinces entered the market this year, foreign firms, tea shops, and raw tea merchants borrowed money from banks and sent agents to purchase from the producing areas. Qimen, Wenzhou, Pingshui, Huizhou, and other places had a bumper tea harvest. However, except for domestic tea shops and raw tea that are allowed to be shipped to Shanghai for sale, foreign tea, including black tea, green tea, and tea bricks, is strictly prohibited from being shipped to Shanghai and must be concentrated for export from Hong Kong. Tea factories in various places have been rushing to produce, and exports of Chinese tea have increased sharply since May, valued at more than 10 million national currency units. As for the tea collected by Fuhua Company, it is limited to foreign tea, because the Trade Commission has signed tea sales contracts with the Soviet Union and other countries, designating Hong Kong as the port of export.

Spring Cocoons: Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are cocoon-producing areas. After the spring cocoons in various places entered the market, the cities were controlled and purchased by so-called "Central China Companies," while in rural towns, manufacturers were allowed to purchase freely. Cocoon shops in various parts of Zhejiang have successively stopped weighing, while cocoon shops in Wuxi, Jiangsu, have opened. However, manufacturers who purchased cocoons in Zhejiang wanted to transport them to Shanghai and the concession areas, but were blocked by the Japanese. Negotiations are currently underway between manufacturers and the Japanese. Silk mills in the concession originally planned to start operations after the spring cocoons entered the market, but now they have had to postpone them due to the blocking of new cocoons from being shipped to Shanghai. Regarding the Jiangsu-Zhejiang spring cocoon harvest, improved varieties account for about 80-90%, which can be said to be a bumper harvest, while native varieties have a poor harvest. However, the total spring cocoon production has increased compared to last year.

Wheat: China's wheat-producing areas are widespread throughout the country, with Shanghai being the gathering area. Now, wheat from various places has begun to enter the market. Wheat from the Changjiang (Yangtze) River Delta area has arrived in Shanghai. Manufacturers and grain shops have sent personnel to collect the goods. The first batch of new wheat from Pudong and other places arriving in Shanghai is about 100 bags, with a quoted price of about 5.5 yuan. It is reported that the Jiangbei area had a bumper harvest this year, estimated to produce about 4 million bags. Flour mills in Shanghai, such as Fuxin and Fufeng, are also preparing to purchase as much as possible, but only those suitable for flour production. The foreign wheat previously ordered has already arrived in Shanghai one after another, totaling about 2 million metric tons. Now, because new wheat has entered the market, the ordering of foreign wheat has been stopped to avoid large amounts of foreign exchange leakage.

### Learning to "Rebel" (Fǎn)

— Fang Kai

The "rebel" ("反" - fǎn) in "learning to 'rebel'" does not refer to the "rebel" ("造反" - zàofǎn) in "rebellion," nor does it refer to the "rebel" ("反" - fǎn) in "inferring three corners from one corner." It refers to the "rebel" ("反" - fǎn) in "oppose" ("反對" - fǎnduì") and "opposite" ("相反" - xiāngfǎn"). In this world, there are things that are positive and things that are negative, and sometimes the positive cannot be used, and only the negative can be used, or sometimes the positive will inevitably turn into its opposite. Therefore, if you seize the opportunity and make great use of the negative, you can gain the favor of others, be assured of success, kill without paying with your life, and get rich without lifting a finger. Knowing the essence of this is extremely useful for interacting with people and conducting affairs. The meaning of "rebel" is great!

I once talked about a joke, saying that a brother had a piece of candy in his hand and said to his younger brother, "If you can guess what I have in my hand, I will give you this candy to eat." At that time, I thought this person was too stupid and had to laugh at him, but later I regretted that this laughter was very inappropriate. Originally, whether he had candy in his hand or not was not mentioned in the book, and I had no way of knowing. If, unfortunately, he did not have candy in his hand, he would be the smartest person in the world, and the person who laughed at him would be the stupidest person in the world. Because he said he had candy when he had no candy, it is the negative. Not only will his younger brother not be able to guess, but I think if you took it to all the 1.6 billion people in the world to guess, I'm afraid no one would say that he really has no candy. His great wisdom can be known to the world.

For example, all the stores are having big sales, big bargain sales, crazy bargains, auctions, giveaways, and prize-guessing, making it very lively, and everyone is tired of seeing it. You come up with "Always pragmatic, not appealing to discounts." On the one hand, you can use the "appeal" of "not appealing to discounts" to "appeal," and when people come to buy, and you want to offer a discount, you can point to the advertisement and say, "Not appealing to discounts naturally means no discounts. Our store is pragmatic and far superior to other stores. Moreover, a great man's words are as fast as a team of horses." In this way, you will gain both fame and profit, achieving two things at once. This further shows the great usefulness of "rebel."

From this, it can be seen that "rebel" can make you achieve great wisdom, gain fame and profit, and is extremely useful. Therefore, since we live in this world as human beings, reading books, doing things, eating, and sleeping, we have to learn "rebel." As mentioned above, "rebel" can gain you favor, make you assured of success, allow you to not pay with your life, and allow you to not lift a finger. Therefore, while Mr. Geng Zhi is advocating "learning to be clever" and "learning to push," I also come up with a set of "doing things in reverse."

For example, if someone is ignorant, you can say he is "learned"; if someone is stingy, you can say he is "generous"; if someone is stupid, you can call him "honest"; if someone is not prominent, you can say "I have long admired your name like thunder, but I have been unable to pay my respects due to geographical barriers." If someone is insane, you can call him "noble and humorous," worthy of comparison to Chun Yu Kun and Ximen Bao, and following in the footsteps of Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel. You can also say that if the Grand Historian were alive, he would write a biography for you. In short, you can adapt to the circumstances, understand them spiritually, and at any rate, only expend a little effort of your tongue. Others will say you are good, and you can do a decent favor yourself. If you add the sentence "Always pragmatic, not praising others," then the value is even greater.

Furthermore, if you are farting, you can use a handkerchief to cover your own nose. If you want to kill someone, you can say that you are also among those being killed. If you are engaging in lewd behavior, you can say that you will also suffer the consequences. If you do this in reverse, you will be innocent. Not only can the sin be pushed away, but also, in addition to avoiding it, you can use it to manipulate others. This is not included in "learning to push," so I mention it separately. Similarly, if you want to make money, you can declare yourself incorruptible; if you want to do both things at once, you can say that you are not involved in either; if you want to be a bat, you can say you are a hybrid to save trouble; if you want to be a translator, you can also say you are absorbing foreign culture; even marrying a foreign wife can be said to be reducing the foreign population and causing a labor shortage there; working somewhere can be said to be absorbing foreign capital and bringing it back to the country, causing a financial drain there. Therefore, abandoning the country can be called loving the country, seeking peace can be called saving the people, and so on, which are too numerous to list.

Once you "rebel" like this, if it fits the situation, everyone will believe you. As long as you speak eloquently, resonantly, and logically, everyone will definitely feel that you are the only one to be respected, without any doubt, and they may even treat your words as the truth and include them in the Four Books and Five Classics. Because in the world, only you are the most intelligent, and there is only this one, without any separation. Others are either extremely foolish, moderately foolish, or slightly foolish. Your intelligence is unmatched in the world and has never been seen since the beginning of mankind. Therefore, "rebel" must be known, must be learned, and must be practiced. If you know it and can put it into practice, learn it and can practice it, then isn't it delightful? There is no doubt.

### A Monument Without Words

— Ding Di

This is a deep valley, damp, gloomy, without human voices, without footsteps. Stalactites on the walls drip with trickling springs, mixed with green moss. A night as black as ink. It seems that my vision is particularly sluggish. I cannot use the soft bristle brush of my eyes to wipe away the thick dust that has accumulated.

Vaguely, I ponder, I ponder, through the high crevice, like a white egret flying, flying towards the depths of the blue sky. Soaring in the macrocosm, floating clouds become my footpads, stepping on layers of clouds, I ascend to the high heavens.

It is not lonely. I do not have the usual loneliness of a traveler, the contemplation in a lonely inn under a dim lamp, the sigh beside an old tree and a crow on an ancient road. A long journey does not make me feel bored. Under the layers of the firmament, I read long stories one after another. The story is inscribed on a monument. One story, long, perhaps endless. I can never finish reading it. It proves life. It is life. Striving, rebirth, creation, beauty, glory, all are told to us in the story. Carved on the White Cloud Mountain, on the stars, on the sun and the moon, these are the monuments, monuments without words.

It should be said that this monument is as tall as the heavens. Often, a person with sincerity and courage to look at the monument can often discover the boundless height of the monument. Step on another layer of clouds. Add another layer of soft cushions under your feet. A free traveler can constantly see this monument. When the sun rises from the sea, and the heavenly rooster is heard in the air, even in the dim stars of the Well constellation, you can still get this wordless inscription as your companion when you ascend to the high heavens. It is definitely not at your feet, it is higher than you, higher than the sun and moon, higher than the stars, higher than the white clouds. You continue, you are moved, you shed tears, lonely joy, dispirited pushing, struggling comfort, entranced awakening.

It seems that these many stories are the ones you are most familiar with. It is also a life, explaining life, explaining the success of struggle, the destination of justice. This story touches you, makes you understand life, makes you know that life is only about struggle. You read a magnificent story, touched by the people in the monument, and mourn their magnificence. The story also makes you hesitate, you shed tears, smeared the inscription, buried the thoughts, made them the foundation of your monument, and now you are reading another bigger monument, you will not be able to tell whether this is for your emotion or the lament of the people in the monument. You are very familiar with the stories in the monument, the greatness opens your heart and lungs, the joy makes you slam the table and shout, the wails of the people in the monument are your tears, the anger is your curse. Laughter is your smiling face. You can count the beating of the hearts and the breathing of the mouths and noses of thousands of people in silence. There were no words on the monument originally, but you cannot help but be amazed by the magic of wordlessness. Angry claws tear at your chest, and insults also run through your heart with a heavy hammer. A plain of fragrant grass unfolds before your eyes, many lessons from the race, and memories in the mind. Often, in amazement, unconsciously, while silently reciting the inscription, you cry bitterly, shed tears, encounter danger, struggle, and finally awaken, hesitate, decide, and feel at ease. You push aside your pillow and despise the clown in your dream. At this moment, the first sun shines on the tall forest...

Accompanied by us, break through the sky, walk out of the dream, spread our wings, we have courage, we are not lonely. For example, our journey is to experience a life of struggle, and the monument is a signpost and spur for the pioneers, it is a past, explaining sacrifice and success. It is also life, giving us life to prove.

Without the songs and poems of a clear temple, without the strange words of Zuo Qiusou, without the deep eaves of coverage, you don't have to worry about the wetness of the rain, the wildfires of the burning collection, the horns of mad cows. There is not a single word, yet it has written down the struggle of mankind for thousands of years, darkness and light, round faces and beasts, baseness and sublimity. There is not a single punctuation mark. Yet it moves people, makes people cry, history, only makes people feel tedious and emptiness, dull like a machine, rotten like rotten wood. You will therefore praise the monument more, a living and fresh life, with blood, with struggle, with success, with sacrifice, with magnificence, leading you, and also explaining you. You react because of the emotion, and your life becomes a monument. Give the monument an explanation, give mankind praise, it is like a strict teacher, correcting you, criticizing you, teaching you, and a close friend, relying on you, accompanying you, helping you. When you flap your wings and fight the wind, you need the monument to lead and encourage you, to complete your free flight. Complete your free flight, like the past people in the monument. From struggle to immortality, write down the past and the present on the monument.

You silently recite, encouraging others; you struggle with your eyes, giving others an ode.

Carved on the white clouds, on the stars, on the sun and the moon, these are the monuments, monuments without words.

### From Chengdu to Xi'an

— Lin Huanping

3. So much importance to people

On the morning of the third day, the sky was just showing the color of fish belly, and we crawled out of the darkness and the dirty quilts of the inn, put the towel into a soup bowl-sized basin, soaked it in water, roughly washed our faces, and took our luggage and left the inn, climbing onto the truck. A gray-white frost shrouded the surroundings, and the whistling wind pierced our hearts and lungs. Everyone was shrinking like a snail, squatting on the car. The snot dripping from their noses showed how much they loved the cold air. The driver hadn't come yet—probably hadn't gotten up yet. In fact, there was no need for the passengers to climb onto the car so early to wait and suffer the cold, but the Chinese are too selfish, and they always rush to climb onto the car early to occupy the good seats, leaving no room for those who come later to insert their feet. So everyone had to compete to grab seats.

Everyone抢你夺我,叽哩咕噜吵了好一会儿, the sun had already showed its face stubbornly on the mountain peak in the east. The driver and the assistant who pressed the car, wearing khaki cotton uniforms, walked out of the inn looking a bit sleep-deprived, and the passengers' mood was relieved a little: the car could start.

The driver and the assistant worked together to add gasoline and inspect the machine parts, then they both jumped into the car, put the motor into gear with a *bu bu bu* sound, and were just about to drive away when they asked the passengers:

"Are all the passengers here?"

"All here," the passengers answered in unison.

At this instant, a soldier came imposingly from across the street and waved his hand, calling out:

"I want to ride on your car."

He was wearing a khaki wool uniform, with his leather coat open, about forty-five years old, with dark cheeks, slightly protruding eyes, revealing a fierce look. He was wearing a short sword and carrying a pistol, but he had not fastened his collar badge, so his rank was unknown. A truck, in addition to being fully loaded with luggage, was also carrying twenty-four passengers, so there was originally no room to stand. Therefore, when the passengers heard him say he wanted to ride on this car, everyone instinctively answered in unison:

"There's no room."

He pretended not to hear, and continued to walk towards the car. Approaching the side of the car, he wanted to climb up. The passengers said again:

Seeing that the car really couldn't fit another person, and that the passengers unanimously refused to let him ride, the driver jumped out of the car and said to the soldier:

"There's really no room on the car. Please take the second car."

"I'll give you money."

The soldier had already started to get angry, and took out a ten-yuan bill from his pocket and threw it at the driver, while wanting to climb into the car himself. The driver was a young man of about twenty-five years old. His temper was also very high, and he hurriedly replied:

"Passengers can't buy a ticket even if they give dozens of dollars. If you want to ride, go to the company to buy a ticket. We don't sell tickets here." (To be continued)

### Commitment

— Xu Qing

Night descends into my room, the air as heavy as an ancient tomb.

The dim light casts my shadow on the wall, like a gaunt pine, thin and disheveled. I manage a wry smile, knowing I am deeply lonely.

A gentle knock at the door.

A young friend enters, silent, as if an unexpected guest. I struggle to recall his name, his background, his personality – almost impossible. The only certainty is that he is my friend. He scans me with a keen gaze, seemingly aware of my confusion.

"Friend! Have you even forgotten me?"

His tone feels more familiar.

"Truly, please forgive my forgetfulness!" I say apologetically.

"Then surely you remember what happened two years ago! Just two short years! Has city life eroded your memory so thoroughly?"

I remember now. He is indeed a close friend. Two years ago, he was younger, more given to laughter and talk. Now he is haggard, his face darkened, his hair long and wild, like a tangle of weeds.

"Where have you been all this time?"

"I! I've been pulling ropes." A smile illuminates his shadowed face.

"Pulling ropes! Don't you find it bitter?"

"You're too dull. Don't you know the rewards that follow suffering?" He chuckled, removing his shirt to reveal two dark, leathery shoulders crisscrossed with rope burns, the purple bruising peeking through the raw skin.

"Ah! What beautiful marks!" I exclaim. "Many of us pull a massive boat, through rushing rapids and treacherous mountain gorges. No day, no night, enduring wind, snow, and the scorching sun. You must understand, accomplishing a difficult and noble task, that is a sacred thing!"

As he speaks, gesturing as if pulling a rope, I feel my desk shifting, my room moving, the world in motion.

"Sacred deed—sacred deed—a great sacred deed—"

"Friend, don't get too excited. The work isn't finished yet! It's just that our boat is a little old, needs some urgent repairs. Well, I must be going!"

Swiftly, too fast to grasp, he is gone.

He is gone.

A tide of emotion surges through me. This small room can no longer contain me. I leap up and hurl a pen with force:

"Get to it, pull up the ancestral tow rope!"

### English South China Morning Post Editorial: Expressing Firm Belief in Our Legal Tender

Allowing Legal Tender to Seek a New Level is the Most Effective Method

The price of the national currency has recently undergone slight changes. Authoritative opinions suggest that this does not harm our country. The Hong Kong English South China Morning Post published an editorial yesterday titled "Chinese Currency," expressing optimism about the authoritative views and believing that our country's credit has not disappeared and our country's monetary policy has achieved good results. The translation of the article is as follows:

The authoritative opinions recently expressed regarding Chinese legal tender provide a good assurance. The sudden cessation of support for Chinese legal tender appears obvious, but the reasons are not as commonly suspected. It is not primarily political but, to a large extent, a strategic response to the war with Japan. However, this can only be speculated. Reports targeting speculators provide significant reference material. According to authoritative opinions, this is a result of natural conditions, most notably China's imbalanced foreign trade and "capital outflow." Due to these factors, maintaining exchange rates is difficult and risks depleting the stabilization fund. Therefore, the authorities have decided to allow the legal tender to seek its own price level and then maintain that new level. It has been confidently stated that this measure can be implemented firmly. It is recalled that a similar step was taken in June 1938, when the exchange rate fell from one shilling and two pence to eight pence, and the eight-pence exchange rate was maintained for a year. China's wartime economic policy, according to the authority, has been effective. Many items previously imported are now manufactured domestically, and reports of an expected bumper harvest this year should help reduce imports. Meanwhile, arrangements have been made for the foreign exchange needed by the government to purchase military supplies and other goods, so as not to affect the foreign exchange market. Finally, the stabilization fund has been replenished, and efforts to expand the fund's base have been successful. Careful consideration will surely lead one to accept the assurances of the authorities. The fact that the Chinese currency was prevented from falling further when it reached six and a half pence is credible. The state of panic-stricken capital flight often seen during foreign exchange collapses does not exist. According to Reuters, a rate of thirty-five yuan to one pound is not the best or cheapest way to protect capital. Conservatives prefer to buy stocks or sense the danger of European war affecting national currencies. Under today's management system, holding currencies of various countries cannot guarantee stability. We must remember that China is not a country in a normal state today, and ups and downs are inevitable. The possibility of the Chinese legal tender rebounding cannot be dismissed. Regardless of the Ministry of Finance's situation, China cannot be called bankrupt. The biggest difficulty is foreign exchange, not resources. Factory openings for purchasing military supplies should have a positive effect, and the industrial cooperative movement can help increase remittances from overseas Chinese and reduce the country's foreign payments. China's credit remains good. The most noteworthy aspect of the authority's comments is the replenishment of the fund. Whether the fund has covered its losses or increased its resources is not clearly explained. However, based on various phenomena, the situation is still satisfactory. The fund will inevitably suffer losses, but it has not reached the point of depletion. Even according to Japanese rumors, no one dares say that ten million pounds has become forty million pounds. Considering the fund's large deposits in Hong Kong, the claim that the fund currently only holds a portion in the UK (i.e., five million pounds) is inaccurate. Under the same interpretation, the Hong Kong dollar will not fall. The Financial Secretary's remarks were expected. Although there has been much commentary in Shanghai on the sudden changes in the price of Chinese legal tender, there is no need to worry. If the authorities cannot handle the situation properly, shortsighted individuals will ask why make efforts to support it. The answer is that free trade in legal tender is important. In addition to military supplies, China must purchase food. Furthermore, if China allows the legal tender to decline, Japan will manipulate the financial market to eliminate the interests of foreigners and enslave the Chinese people.

### Philippine Initiates Far East Youth Conference: Uniting Youth; Sends Representatives to Hong Kong to Confer with Student Circles; Student Relief Association Holds Warm Welcome Meeting Last Night

The Philippine Chinese Youth Association recently sent representatives, including Liu Ziwang and two others, to Hong Kong to discuss the convening of the Far East Youth Conference with Hong Kong's youth student circles. The Hong Kong Student Relief Association, in order to understand the overall situation of the Philippine overseas Chinese's efforts to save the nation, specially held a tea party at the Association last night at eight o'clock to welcome the representatives and exchange opinions. Thirty members of the Association attended, and the atmosphere was exceptionally enthusiastic. They gathered at eight o'clock for the meeting. After saluting,

Chairman's Speech

The meeting was opened by Chairman Li Zhengyao, who briefly stated, "Three representatives of the Philippine Youth Association have come to our Association today. On behalf of the students, I extend a warm welcome. We know that the overseas Chinese students in the Philippines have supported the war of resistance against Japan and aided the war of resistance for the past two years, and they have achieved excellent results. Last year, they launched the organization of the All-Philippine Student Youth Conference, forming a solid wall of Philippine youth and exerting its great power to aid our country's war of resistance. This spirit is enough to inspire all overseas Chinese in the Philippines to be even more enthusiastic about national salvation work. Such amazing achievements are truly admirable. For two years, in addition to military force, the [Japanese] have used various other methods to [invade] our country, exhaustively [flattering] and [enticing] youth in various places to cover up their acts of aggression. For example, they recently organized a tour group to Japan in the Philippines, actively enticing Philippine youth to visit Japan, and giving them extremely good treatment after they arrived in Japan, using the ignorant to spread propaganda and cover up the truth. In order to expose this conspiracy of the Japanese, young people with aspirations are convening the Far East Youth Conference, so that the youth of the Far East can unite together, [ ]. This time, the three representatives have come to Hong Kong from the Philippines, braving a long journey. On behalf of the students, I sincerely offer our mutual assistance in this matter, so that it can be realized as soon as possible, and I wish the representatives success when they go to Chongqing."

Representative's Speech

After the chairman's speech, Liu Ziwang, the representative of the Philippine Youth Association, gave a speech on the overall situation of the Philippine overseas Chinese youth's efforts to save the nation. Mr. Liu stood up and spoke in Mandarin, saying that the Philippine overseas Chinese youth's efforts to save the nation have very little experience, so the results are not as good as those in Hong Kong. This time, I hope to get more instructions from you on the direction of national salvation work, so as to be a model for us. In the past, Philippine overseas Chinese students studied in foreign schools and some studied in overseas Chinese schools. The environments were different and the concepts were different, so there was very little unity. "Since the August 13th Incident," all the students in the Philippines deeply knew that everyone needed to unite to serve the motherland, so at this time the Philippine Overseas Chinese Youth Association was established, concentrating the power of all the young students in the Philippines to expand the national salvation propaganda work. Mobile propaganda teams were organized to disperse to the villages all over the Philippine Islands, publicizing in all places where Chinese [lived]. They went through once, twice, three times. This kind of activity propaganda was able to achieve considerable results. All overseas Chinese in the Philippines had a deeper understanding of the motherland's war of resistance. In December of last year, the Youth Association once convened the International Student Conference. Representatives from all countries in the Far East participated. At the conference, the actual facts of our country's war of resistance and the [Japanese's] various acts of aggression were publicized as much as possible. The representatives expressed their deep sympathy for our country. Since then, there has been further expression of aid to China. The understanding and actions of people in the Philippines regarding our country's war of resistance can be roughly divided into three periods. The first period was at the beginning of the "July 7th" incident. A small number of people had already expressed sympathy for our country's war of resistance, and they immediately organized the "China Friendship Society," but the majority of people did not yet understand the truth of our country's war of resistance. In the second period, the majority of intellectuals had already understood that our country was fighting to maintain world justice and peace, and they actively promoted the aid to China movement. The third period was the beginning of practical action, such as donating money to relieve our country's wounded soldiers and refugees, boycotting Japanese goods, etc., which were very strenuous. Recently, the "Philippine Peace Conference" was established, and the "Guarantee Democratic Alliance" organization was formed to help China resist aggression and sanction aggression, and further devote itself to maintaining the peace and security of the Pacific. The purpose of launching the Far East Youth Conference this time is to unite the youth of the Far East, concentrate their strength, and achieve the purpose of maintaining justice and peace. The delegation was specially sent to Hong Kong to negotiate with the comrades of the Hong Kong Youth Student Circle on how to proceed, hoping to get your advice, etc. After the representatives finished their speeches, representatives of the Student Relief Association reported on the association's affairs. The Philippine representative Yu Binghong gave a speech. Finally, there was a tea party, and the meeting was dismissed after a free talk.

### Woman Misunderstands Military Barracks: Mental Illness? Awaiting Doctor's Examination for Sentencing

Woman Yao Xiuying, twenty-two years old, from Shanghai, was accused of entering the Murray Barracks privately on the 10th of this month. When the case was brought before the Central Magistracy on the morning of the 10th, the defendant claimed that her sister was working at a Westerner's residence on the Peak. That night, she wanted to visit her sister. She was from Shanghai and had only been in Hong Kong for a short time, so she didn't know the way and mistakenly entered the restricted area. Two Westerners in uniform escorted her to a place and then took off her upper and lower garments, etc. The magistrate believed that the defendant's statement should be investigated to determine its truth. Therefore, the case was postponed until the morning of the 12th for further review. When the case was reviewed again yesterday morning, the prosecutor, Mr. Baker, told the magistrate that the defendant appeared to be suffering from mental illness. The magistrate asked the defendant why she went to find her sister at night rather than during the day. The defendant said that if she went to the Peak during the day, she would be stopped by the police. According to the defendant's uncle, his niece had a slight mental illness. The magistrate postponed the case for seven days to allow a doctor to examine the defendant to determine if she was suffering from mental illness before sentencing.

### Alimony Lawsuit: Case Takes a Sudden Turn: Defendant Discovered to Have a Wife; Plaintiff's Identity Requires Urgent Proof

Shantou native Lin Fenglong was previously sued by Li Huiqing in the Central Magistracy, alleging that Lin failed to provide alimony for Li and their child. Yesterday afternoon, the case was reviewed by Justice of the Peace for the third time. At the previous hearing, the plaintiff suddenly heard that the defendant already had a wife. Therefore, the proceedings in this case focused on proving the plaintiff's status. At yesterday's hearing, the plaintiff first submitted her marriage documents to the magistrate for review and explained the effect of each document on Chaozhou marriages, which took more than a quarter of an hour. Then, the plaintiff's sister-in-law testified about the discussions between her and the defendant's mother regarding the marriage of the two parties. After giving only a few words, the Justice of the Peace adjourned the hearing and advised the plaintiff to hire a lawyer to present the case in court. The plaintiff agreed, and the magistrate postponed the case to the fifteenth for a hearing. Then, all parties will set a date for further hearings.

### Hong Kong Tourist Guide Agency: Female Tour Guide Commits Suicide: Drafts a Suicide Note: Elaborating on Her Life Experiences

The Hong Kong Tourist Guide Agency at 10 Peel Street, 2nd floor, rented Room 507 on the 5th floor of the Lucarno Hotel at 148 Des Voeux Road Central as a residence. At around 3 a.m. yesterday morning, the tour guides were gathering in the room after finishing work. One of the tour guides, named Meng Beiqiu (26 years old, registered as Liang Munian in the store), was frowning and had a sorrowful expression. When a companion asked her the reason, she hesitated and then entrusted a letter to her companion to be sent back to the owner of the Hong Kong Tourist Guide Agency. The companion noticed that Meng had suddenly changed her usual behavior and paid a little attention to her. At around 4 a.m., the tour guides had taken off their clothes and gone to bed. Meng also pretended to be asleep. Unexpectedly, Meng took advantage of the fact that no one was aware and suddenly took opium paste, intending to end her life. After taking it, she was poisoned and moaned [and] tossed and turned in bed, which awakened her companions. Everyone saw that [her] mouth was spitting white foam, and there was an opium pipe nearby. Everyone knew that she had taken poison, so they quickly informed the manager of the room and called for an ambulance to the scene, and sent her to Queen Mary Hospital for rescue. At the same time, several detectives went to investigate. The letter that Ms. Meng entrusted to her companion to be sent back to the owner of the Hong Kong Tourist Guide Agency was a suicide note, elaborating on her experiences. It was also taken to Queen Mary Hospital. Fortunately, she did not take too much poison. After the doctor washed her stomach, she had a little sense of consciousness and was not in danger of losing her life.

### Police Detectives Will Conduct Random Checks on Pedestrians to Maintain Public Order

If Encountered, Do Not Attempt to Evade Inspection, Otherwise Police Detectives May Fire to Stop You

—If An Incident Occurs, Seek A Safe Zone For Avoidance—

Recently, in various places in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories, banditry has been rampant, with murders and robberies occurring frequently. Recently, it has intensified, and even occurred on major thoroughfares, with shootings and resistance to arrest. Recently in Hong Kong, Chinese Detective Yin Wen was shot and fatally wounded by bandits. At the same time, several pedestrians were injured by stray bullets. On the sea side, in the robbery case at Yongxiang Gold Store on Shanghai Street, a female servant was also killed on the spot by stray bullets. Since these bloody cases have occurred continuously, the public has been greatly shocked. The police authorities have taken remedial measures, ordering all police detectives to increase the power of their duties. In the future, if bandits forcibly rob and rob, and if police detectives attempt to intervene, but they immediately run away, regardless of whether they are carrying guns or sharp objects, the police detectives have the right to fire to stop them. Police detectives may conduct random checks on anyone at any time and must not resist or attempt to evade or avoid such actions. Otherwise, in order to enforce their duties and prevent sudden attacks by bandits, the police detectives may fire at the person being checked. Previously, no matter what happened on the streets, passers-by, driven by curiosity, often liked to stop and watch what was happening. As a result, more and more spectators gathered. This not only hindered traffic but was also dangerous for the passers-by themselves. If there is a battle between police and bandits, it is inevitable that they will be affected. The police authorities have stated that if a robbery or pursuit occurs, passers-by should immediately avoid it in a safe zone and must not flee in panic. In this way, on the one hand, it can avoid obstructing the progress of police detectives in arresting bandits, and on the other hand, it can prevent oneself from suffering an unexpected disaster. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will understand the police's painstaking efforts to curb banditry and provide police detectives with convenience to exercise their powers within the possible scope.

### Communication Between the Rear and the Front Lines

— Li Yueqin

A Record of the Morning Bell Sports Association's Fundraising for the Comfort of Soldiers in Eastern Guangdong

One dim dusk, in a dilapidated building, two rows of benches were placed side by side. Nine members of the preparatory committee for the Morning Bell Sports Association's fundraising campaign to comfort soldiers in Eastern Guangdong sat closely together, each wearing a solemn and tense expression. The question of "how to expand the comfort work" permeated the hearts of all nine, who were thinking deeply together.

A heated discussion began after the chairman announced the purpose of the meeting. A tense atmosphere enveloped the entire venue, suffocating everyone's breathing. Expanding the fundraising campaign for comfort items became the central issue.

A female worker wearing a dark blue serge cheongsam spoke with a very determined voice:

"In order to ensure that this fundraising campaign can achieve greater success, it is necessary to contact various factory owners to obtain assistance and convenience from all parties."

Her powerful tone captured everyone's attention.

Immediately following, another important proposal was made:

"We should deepen this fundraising campaign into the masses and transform it into a conscious action of the masses. Therefore, how to raise the enthusiasm of the masses to a high level is something we cannot ignore. I believe that conducting a competition for the fundraising of comfort items is an important step in raising the enthusiasm of the masses."

These two important proposals were immediately approved by the entire group.

With the work decided, the hearts of each member were extraordinarily lively. They had a strong common belief: as long as they worked hard, excellent results would surely be obtained by them.

The next morning, the sun kissed the old signboard of the ×× Weaving Factory, but it did not have the opportunity to greet the people who were enthusiastically raising funds for comfort items. The factory was surrounded by five or six hundred male and female workers, and every gaze was drawn to the loud voice of the speaker.

A speaker stood upright, his voice so powerful, stirring everyone's emotions:

"...Our lives as workers are hard enough! But our compatriots in the occupied areas are living even more miserable lives than pigs and dogs: × and ××, they are our dear compatriots, and they have our parents and wives... Every soldier fighting on the front lines was raised by parents, and they abandon their families to fight the × people in order to save those innocent compatriots and defend the Republic of China..."

Every impassioned and powerful word struck the hearts of the five or six hundred workers. Their breathing was so short and suffocated. A bloody picture flickered in their eyes, and a tense emotion pressed on their lungs. No, they were so determined. The suffering of their compatriots was deeply engraved in their minds.

"I donate half a dozen towels!" "Hey, a dozen toothbrushes here!" "And I donate four dimes!" The voices were so noisy.

"I also donate..." A worker who used to be a factory owner and foreman... his...

Under such enthusiastic donations, a glorious page in the history of the factory was opened.

The propagandists showed smiling faces, deeply moved by the workers' donations. Similarly, they were also extremely grateful for the factory owner's wisdom in being willing to allocate thirty minutes of work time to facilitate the promotion of fundraising for comfort items.

Rubber shoes, towels, and medicines piled up in a corner on the east side of the wall, like the pyramids of ancient Egypt. But because people were busy piling them up, they appeared chaotic and unstable. However, people routinely piled them up like this every night, continuing until late at night.

This large-scale fundraising not only obtained donations from many backward lower-class people, but also some factory workers spontaneously launched a charity campaign, and some even requested that the money left over from purchasing national salvation bonds in the past be donated to the soldiers on the front lines.

This is such a moving page! In the giant tide of the salvation movement in Hong Kong, the Morning Bell Sports Association appeared before people in a new and striking posture!

After two or three months of the war... things were different, especially for the lower classes. They had wielded their strength to fight for the liberation of the nation!

### Dutch Anthropologist Arrives in Hong Kong to Discuss Java Man and Peking Man; Research on Which is the Most Ancient Human Remains a Mystery; Java Ape-Man Said to Be More Ancient

There are said to be two of the world's most ancient human races, one being "Java Ape-Man" and the other being "Peking Man". But which is the most ancient remains a mystery to this day. According to Dr. Gonneswart, a famous Dutch anthropologist, "Java Ape-Man" is more ancient. Mr. Gonneswart was funded by the Ebenalki Academy to collect materials and conduct research in Beiping. After staying in Beiping for four months, he went to Java. He passed through Hong Kong yesterday. It is said that there has been repeated controversy over whether "Java Ape-Man" and "Peking Man" are human. He insisted on the theory that the two kinds of people are closely related. After four months of research in Beiping, he believes that his theory is correct. "Java Ape-Man" is very similar to apes, and its most obvious feature is its flat skull, with a brain only half the size of modern humans. It has been proven that "Java Ape-Man" could use stone tools, and "Peking Man" could also use stone tools. Therefore, these two kinds of people are indeed human. Mr. Gonneswart finally said that "Java Ape-Man" migrated to Java from South China. The elephant-like animals of Malaya and other places also originated in South China, passing through Taiwan, the Philippines, and reaching Borneo and Java. The fossils discovered in Java can be used as proof. Four hundred thousand years ago, the Chinese sea was originally land. It only became the current terrain after it subsided.

### Sheltering a Young Girl: Concubine or Servant; Conflicting Accounts from Both Parties

Huang Chaotang (37 years old), a lace worker, was charged by Fraser of the Chinese Civil Affairs Department in the Kowloon Magistracy yesterday morning with sheltering an unregistered maidservant Zheng Yan (18 years old) and assaulting her. During the interrogation, Zheng Yan stated that two years ago, her mother sold her to the defendant as a concubine for $120 in her hometown. Although she had shared a bed with the defendant for two nights, she was still a virgin. However, since she came to Hong Kong with the defendant, she had to work at home all day long, serving like a maidservant. She even had to eat separately from her husband (i.e., the defendant) for breakfast and dinner. At 5:00 PM on May 22nd, the defendant needed her to change his clothes, but she was unable to do so. The defendant and his wife then beat her with a rattan cane. She reported the matter to the police station. The defendant stated in court that he did not intentionally beat the plaintiff, it was just a momentary anger. He also stated that the plaintiff was his concubine and was not treated like a maidservant. The judge then ordered the case to be adjourned for one month so that the defendant could produce evidence of his marriage to the plaintiff as proof.

### Shen Bao Cup Basketball Charity Match: Zhonghua Defeats Southwest, Zhi Xing Easily Defeats Hua Xiong

In the first match of the Shen Bao Cup Women's Basketball Charity Match last night, Southwest played against Zhonghua. Although Southwest was not a strong team and its fighting power was inferior to Zhonghua, all players were able to bravely go forward and stick to the end, so the competition was very fierce. At times, they posed a fierce threat to Zhonghua. Ye Peizhi suddenly launched a surprise attack, and Zhu Xianzhi and Wu Ruixin responded on both sides. In addition, Li Chanxiang and He Wanxiang strongly resisted the incoming forces. Therefore, although Zhonghua had Liu Shouguang, Li Chunyu, and Ye Muzhen launching attacks from three routes, they also felt the pressure. However, Zhonghua's players were experienced and had better coordination, which was able to achieve a flanking effect. Finally, they won with a score of 32 to 14. In terms of individual skills, Ye Muzhen was the most active on the Zhonghua side, and Liu Shouguang and Li Chunyu did their best. Rao Huizhen's defense was slightly inferior, and He Jingxiong was quite insightful. Wu Ruixin and Ye Peizhi were the best on the Southwest side, and the rest were also commendable for their bravery.

After the two armies clashed, Wu Ruixin scored on a free throw. Liu Shouguang and Ye Muzhen of Zhonghua launched counterattacks from both sides. Peizhi scored a long shot. From then on, each team had its gains. At the end of the first quarter, Zhonghua led with 9 to 7. Southwest, having suffered an initial setback, mobilized its entire army in an attempt to counterattack. However, Zhonghua's momentum was like a rainbow. Ye Muzhen, Liu Shouguang, and Li Chunyu's long and close shots were all successful. Although the Southwest players struggled hard, they still fell behind with a score of 12 to 19 due to the disparity in strength. Switching sides, Zhonghua took advantage of their victory and frequently put pressure on Southwest. Southwest struggled to resist, but eventually failed with a score of 14 to 22 due to the disparity in strength.

In the second match, Zhi Xing played against Hua Xiong. Most of the players under Zhi Xing were veterans, while Hua Xiong was a newborn calf. Compared with each other, the strength was very different. After the two sides engaged in battle, Hua Wei both fell behind and were caught in a storm. In the first half, Chen Qixia alone scored two points. In the second half, Lei Yuegui showed great courage and won back several points, but there was no other progress. Finally, they lost with a score of 14 to 34. In terms of the skills of both sides, Zhi Xing's coordination was tacit. Chen Rongtang's long and close shots were successful. He Defang and Wen Weiqiong were also able to cooperate with each other. Sun Yuming and Lin Shaoping strongly resisted Lei Yuegui's offense. Li Shizhen was good at both offense and defense. Hua Xiong's passing was inaccurate, and many of their shots were off target. Lei Yuegui was the most valiant among the forwards, but she was often intercepted by the opponent, and there was no way to progress. Peng Taoxiu and Luo Wensu were quite active, but their strength did not match their intentions, and the rest were not outstanding, and their coordination was not perfect. The disparity in strength led to the defeat.

After the war broke out, He Defang opened the scoring first. Chen Rongtang's shots were accurate and smooth, scoring twelve consecutive points. Li Baozhen and He Defang's attacks from both sides were successful again. Hua Xiong struggled hard, and Chen Qixia finally scored two points. However, Zhi Xing's military appearance was prosperous, leading with a score of 27 to 2. Switching sides, Hua Xiong hoped to counterattack. Lei Yuegui bravely tried to score, and made some gains, but Zhi Xing's Chen Rongtang launched arrows and crossbows together, still leading with a score of 36 to 6. Lei Yuegui made a comeback and won back several points, but it was of no avail. At the end of the game, Zhi Xing won with a score of 34 to 14.

### Bao Lu's Daily Life

He worked at Hongqiao Airport before the War of Resistance; He starred in the film "Sea Burial" during the National Games; This sudden bad news is unknown whether it is true or false. When the banner of the War of Resistance shone with a different kind of brilliance on the 5,000-year-old soil of China, enthusiastic young people from all provinces and regions shouldered their guns, braved the artillery fire, and marched to the front lines.

The songs of the War of Resistance resounded through every desolate village. Rusted guns and bayonets were wiped bright and sparkled.

At this time, people from all walks of life, men and women, joined the military, especially intellectuals, who abandoned their books and rushed to the army.

In the sports world, many famous athletes such as "Little Black Ash" Chen Zhenhe, pole vault king Fu Baolu, and Wang He, the second place in the National Games pole vault, joined the Chinese Air Force to serve the country.

The joining of these famous sports athletes in the Air Force not only showed that outstanding members of the Chinese nation participated in the War of Resistance, but also showed that they were not only "sports stars" but also the most combative members participating in the national War of Resistance.

A few days ago, our newspaper published the bad news that Fu Baolu was martyred in air combat in Guilin. We hope that this unfortunate news is just a rumor. Now let me tell the reader a little about the daily life of this air force soldier.

Fu Baolu, with brown curly hair, a thin but spirited face, a small mustache on his mouth, and not very tall but very strong,

His personality is very irritable, but he is exceptionally straightforward.

He grew up in Harbin. His father was from Northeast China and his mother was Russian. He also has a younger brother and two younger sisters in his family. Now his whole family is in Shanghai, running a ginseng shop on Avenue Joffre.

Because of this relationship, Fu Baolu not only speaks fluent Russian, but also fluent English.

If you don't know Fu Baolu's background, you will find a foreign flavor in him, and you may guess that he is not Chinese. However, among friends or on the road, if someone rashly says that he is Russian, he will immediately get angry when he hears it, and even does not hesitate to fight you, at least he has to tell you clearly that he is a Chinese Harbin native.

Fu Baolu likes to drink very much. After drinking, his temper is sometimes very rude, but he has a very kind heart. Before the war, he worked at Hongqiao Airport. Once, he was half drunk, driving a car with Jin Yan and many other friends, and drove to Hongqiao Airport at a speed of fifty or sixty yards. On the way, he almost collided with another truck, scaring everyone in the car to scream.

He once married a very beautiful Russian wife, but later the two separated. He often misses his foreign wife when he gets drunk, and nervously sheds tears. When he wakes up, his friends shame him.

During the National Games, Wang He wanted to compete with Fu Baolu for the first place in the pole vault. That night, Zhu He turned over and over and couldn't sleep. (He once returned to Shanghai and is now back in the Air Force.) But Fu Baolu still won the first place the next day. In fact, Fu Baolu did not work hard. Some people said that if Fu Baolu could work a little harder, he would not be "nameless" in the World Games.

Fu Baolu also tasted the taste of movies. At that time, Wang Bin was in Tianyi Company and wrote a script himself called "Sea Burial", and decided to invite Fu to star in it, as well as Liu Liying and others to co-star in this film.

At that time, Fu Baolu was really busy. He attended the National Games during the day and filmed "Sea Burial" at night. Later, this film was shown at the Xinguang Grand Theater before the National Games ended.

After the Chinese army withdrew westward, he also left Shanghai. Unexpectedly, such an unexpected bad news came. We can only bless this Air Force soldier to remain safe.

### From Ancient Greece to the Various Aspects of the Olympic Games

— Ding Lao

—A Precious History of Sports—

The Origin of the Olympic Games

The National Festivals of Greece made a great contribution to sports, because they regarded competing to entertain the gods as the most prosperous ceremony in the country. In the first half of the sixth century BC, there were four major competition festivals, namely Pythia, Isthmia, Nemea, and Olympia, among which Olympia was the most important. Regarding the origin of the Olympic Games, some say that King Lyghtu blessed Zeus (the highest god of Greece) in order to maintain peace on the entire island of Greece, some say that Heracles commemorated his father Zeus for destroying the monster clan, some advocate that it is closely related to the olive tree god, and some are based on the love affair set by the poet Pindar. There are many different opinions. Such an investigation into the origin of the Olympic Games is nothing more than a legend of arsenic. In fact, due to geographical reasons, Greece was divided into many city-states. In order to maintain peace, it organized a large-scale religious alliance competition. As for who was the founder of the competition, the orators in Athens at that time could not prove it. Even Homer, who was called the saint of poetry in ancient times, did not have a clear description and the origin of the festival in his epic poems, but only mentioned that athletes from all over the world gathered during the festival and their performance records. According to archaeologists, the sacrificial hall of the Olympic stadium that was recently excavated was at least a thousand years ago, so the first masters of this meeting were not the powerful and domineering Dorian people, but the powerless Elis people. When Lusgns formulated the constitution, he stipulated that the Olympic winner should be the annual law of Greece, so in 770 BC, the winner of the first sprint competition was called Koredos, and historians regarded him as the beginning of Greek history.

Olympia was originally the name of a village, located on the Peloponesus peninsula at the southern tip of Greece. To the west of the island is the small country of Elis. From the Ionian coast, there is a river called Alpheus flowing in. There is a village called Olympia by the river. The village is ten miles away from the sea. There are the Temple of Zeus, sacrificial halls, and tombs on the hills of the village, in which are placed the greatest Greek sculptures,

The statue of Zeus, the tombs of other gods, statues of heroes, statues of winners, and precious contributions from the citizens were all placed in the sacrificial hall. Outside the east wall of the shrine are the stadium and the horse racing track. Each time the festival gathered athletes from various countries, competing with each other, showing their skills, and serving as the only grand ceremony for the country to worship the gods, so the meeting in front of the sacrificial hall in Olympia was called Olympic Games, and the general meeting was held every four years, and the four years in between was called Olympiad.
