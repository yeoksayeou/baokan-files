### Secret Agreement Between Hiranuma and Wang Jingwei

After Wang Jingwei betrayed his country and sided with Japan, his political life in China came to an end, and his position among the Chinese people collapsed. However, Wang's clandestine activities under Japanese direction have become increasingly intense and rampant. The rumor-mongering and slanderous conspiracies of the ×× Daily News, privately run by Wang, and the elements willing to be used by Wang, have also become increasingly intense and rampant. Although such absurd arguments and shameless actions have long been disdained by discerning individuals, and his treacherous conspiracies against human morality have long been eyed with contempt by international justice advocates, some who are ignorant of the general trend have been swayed by their clever words and affected demeanor, expressing some doubts about the future of the war of resistance and national reconstruction, believing that Wang and his followers still possess some humanity. But now, please consider the evidence:

[Chongqing, 5th (Reuters)] A major newspaper in Chongqing today published on a prominent page the details of a secret agreement concluded between Wang Zhaoming and Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma. The content includes five points:

First, Japan should attack from three directions: (1) In North China, Japan must occupy Xi'an to encircle Sichuan and cut off transportation between China and the Soviet Union. (2) In South China, Japan should occupy Nanning to suppress anti-Japanese sentiment in the province and cut off transportation between Guangxi Province and Vietnam. (3) In Central China, Japan should occupy Changsha to cut off the Xiang-Gan Railway and occupy Xiangfan to block transportation between Sichuan and Hunan.

Second, after Japan completes the above, Wang himself will lead the anti-Chiang and anti-communist war efforts.

Third, Wang will be responsible for organizing an Anti-Communist National Salvation Alliance, with himself as the leader.

Fourth, to discuss an agreement to restore peaceful and friendly relations between China and Japan.

Fifth, to realize the second and third points, Japan should pay 3 million yuan. The newspaper claims that the Japanese side has already made two payments. It is said that the contents of the secret agreement were reported by a Mr. Xia (transliteration), who was then a Japanese translator, and only then did the Chinese authorities become aware of it.

Furthermore, according to Chongqing telegrams carried in Hong Kong newspapers yesterday, it was also stated that "Wang personally drafted the so-called conditions for the agreement with Hiranuma, instructing Gao Qi to take them to Tokyo for negotiation. According to what Mr. Xia, a translator from the × side, reliably knew, the main points of the content are five:

(1) In order to easily achieve the common peace goals of Wang and Konoe, Japan should quickly take advantage of the fact that the central government's reorganization is not yet complete and launch a vigorous offensive to complete the following combat missions: (A) In North China, Xi'an should be captured to encircle Sichuan and cut off transportation between China and the Soviet Union. (B) In South China, Nanning should be attacked to deter the anti-Japanese forces in Guangxi and cut off transportation between Annam and Guangxi. (C) In Central China, Nanchang and Changsha should be quickly captured to cut off the Gan-Xiang Railway and advance to Xiangfan and Yichang to control the throat of Hunan and Sichuan. (2) After the × army completes the above tasks, Wang will personally instigate a war to overthrow Chiang and oppose communism, with the certainty of mobilizing more than 20 divisions of troops. (3) Wang will be responsible for forming an Anti-Communist National Salvation Alliance and will personally serve as the chairman of the alliance, commanding everything and eliminating communists and anti-Japanese elements. (4) Regarding the restoration of Sino-Japanese peace and friendly relations, under the principle of joint anti-communism, the fundamental spirit of Konoe's and Wang's statements and telegrams should be implemented, and consultations should be held with various anti-communist regimes. (5) In order to achieve the tasks in items two and three, Japan should provide Wang with 3 million yuan in activity funds each month. Gao ×× carried these conditions and went to Tokyo on February 20th to repeatedly negotiate with Hiranuma, proposing two specific agreements as follows:

First, when the Japanese army advances to Nan×, Nanchang, Changsha, Yichang, Shashi, Xiangfan, and Xi'an, Wang will issue a statement, changing his previous advocacy of peace and automatically coming out to clean up the mess. However, Japanese military actions, at the latest between May and June, will advance to the above-mentioned locations, and then the Chinese situation will inevitably undergo major changes. In order to subvert the National Government, the line from Xiangfan to Hanzhong and the line from Nanyu, Changde, through Guiyang to Sichuan must be garrisoned to carry out a central breakthrough. It is also heard that × has paid 2 million yuan in advance twice, and the officer supporting Wang's faction in the × army is Colonel Kagesa, who will go to × to be responsible for presiding over the affairs. The Guangzhou special mission will be taken over by Nakano Daichi. Wang × advocated that if the × army cannot capture the above-mentioned areas on schedule, as long as the × army advances to Min and Yue, occupies Fuzhou and Shaoguan, it can organize a Southwest government and vigorously promote the expansion of × military operations, which can then manipulate everything, separate China's anti-× front, and carry out political strategy.

Second, Wang's preconditions for assuming ×× are: (1) The abolition of the northern and southern puppet organizations; (2) the organization of a new National Government in Nanjing; (3) the prior establishment of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Alliance; (4) activity funds of 3 million yuan per month; (5) the separate organization of 12 divisions of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army; (6) military expenses loan of 2 million yuan; (7) Jiang and the Japanese side will re-establish a new agreement based on Konoe's statement; (8) international connections with Germany and Italy, with the principle of pulling in Britain and the United States; (9) joining the Anti-Communist Pact.

Wang's secret agreement with Hiranuma has thus been exposed to the world! The exposure of this secret agreement, although it is only a part of Wang's conspiracy since ×× National Party × Central Government × Republic of China, is already sufficient to prove that all of Wang's disguises and postures of "serving the country and the people" after ×× are nothing but deception of the Chinese people and the world! It is already sufficient to prove that the news and arguments of the ×× Daily News, privately run by Wang after his betrayal, are entirely rumors and slanders spread to cater to the intentions of Japan × and even accept their orders! It is already sufficient to prove that the actions of some well-intentioned or unintentionally × traitor-used newspapers that cover up Wang's crimes after his betrayal are unforgivable mistakes, even unforgivable sins! Those who are kind-hearted and do not want to investigate the truth often consider the central government's punishment of Wang and the opposition to Wang as "excessive", and even believe that Wang's "anti-communism" and "peace" are truly for the sake of the country and the people, can now have a thorough awakening!

However, the exposure of the ironclad evidence of Wang's conspiracy does not mean the complete failure of Wang's conspiracy! Judging from the content of the exposed secret agreement between Wang and Hiranuma, there are at least a few points that deserve the attention and vigilance of the people of the whole country, overseas Chinese, and international justice advocates: First of all, from the first and second articles of the already exposed part of the secret agreement and the fifth and sixth articles of the so-called "Wang's conditions for assuming ××", what Wang Jingwei is plotting is not only a political conspiracy of advocating peace and betraying the country, but also a military conspiracy of "overthrowing Chiang and opposing communism" to achieve the destruction of China! Although China is definitely not Czechoslovakia or Spain, and although the Chinese people and countries related to the Far East will definitely not allow the emergence of Hacha and Franco in the East, Wang's collusion with Japan in such a major conspiracy cannot be ignored! Secondly, judging from the third article of the already exposed part of the secret agreement and the first, second, third, and fourth articles of the so-called "Wang's conditions for assuming ××", Wang Jingwei's actions are not only opposition to the central government's policy of resisting Japan and national resistance, but are completely ××××××××××××××; he wants to organize a counter-central government! He wants to "eliminate" all anti-Japanese patriotic elements of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party under the leadership of Chairman Chiang! He wants to turn the whole of China into a second Manchukuo, even to the point of merging with Japan! He wants to turn all Chinese sons and daughters ××××××××××××. Furthermore, from the fourth article of the exposed part of the secret agreement and the third, seventh, and eighth articles of the so-called "Wang's conditions for assuming ××", it can be seen that Wang and Japan's attempt is not only to destroy China, ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××, but those threatened and harmed will not only be the Chinese people, but will also include people all over the world who cherish democracy and peace! Finally, even from the fifth article of the secret agreement and the fourth and sixth articles of the so-called "Wang's conditions for assuming ××", in addition to proving Wang's shameless act of openly taking money from ×, it is even an unparalleled insult to the personality of all our Chinese compatriots from all walks of life! It can even be said to be an insult to the morality of all mankind!

From the above points, we can assert that the words and deeds of Wang and his followers should not only be spurned and ×× by all Chinese compatriots from all walks of life, but should also be spurned by people with backbone and justice all over the world ×××. According to a Chongqing telegram of the 5th: "After the details of Wang Jingwei's collusion with the × side were published, people from all walks of life were extremely indignant. It is heard that the central government initially hoped that Wang would repent, so everything was treated with leniency. Now that Wang's collusion with × to harm the country is well-documented, there can be no more appeasement and will be dealt with severely. Those who helped Wang in his activities will also be punished separately." The righteous indignation of all circles in Chongqing and the central authorities' consideration of severely punishing Wang are naturally inevitable facts. However, in order to preserve the personality of Chinese compatriots from all walks of life, to clarify the vision of international persons, and to prevent the endless conspiracies and poisonous schemes of Japanese × traitors in the future, the people everywhere have unanimously demanded that Wang and his followers be dealt with in accordance with the conditions for punishing traitors, and that an open warrant be issued for their arrest. At the same time, they demand the confiscation of their property, the banning of their newspapers, and the newspapers and magazines used by them, and the expulsion of all their Republic of China ××, ×××××××××××××××××××. These demands, in fact, are probably also the common demands of overseas Chinese. History tells us that a secret agreement or document of a traitorous spy can often overturn millions of troops and even the fate of an entire nation. We must not underestimate the serious threat that Wang Jingwei's secret agreement with Hiranuma contains to the entire Chinese people and even the world! We must not ignore the impact of Wang's words and actions such as "anti-communism", "peace", "compromise", and "mediation" on the entire Chinese people. ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××! Why have our thousands of miles of land been lost? Why have our beautiful homelands, gardens, houses, factories, and shops been destroyed? Why have our hundreds of thousands of loyal and brave soldiers shed blood and sacrificed? Why have our millions of fathers, elders, brothers, sisters been brutally slaughtered, ravaged, ruined, and displaced? Twenty months of arduous struggle and heavy sacrifices, and Wang and his followers are actually trying to comfort them with a ×× contract worth millions, is this what we can tolerate with reservations?

### Where is the [East Asia New Order] Going?

— Chen Baoyin

Since × chieftain Konoe released the enemy's last magic weapon, the "East Asia New Order," on December 22nd last year, the × and traitorous people's kept newspapers have been like ××××, revering it as the most precious treasure and desperately promoting it, believing that it is the only "theory" or "national policy" that × people can get away with today. However, the facts of the past three months have mercilessly proved the ineffectiveness of this magic weapon and the incorrectness of this "theory" or the impossibility of this "national policy." We do not need to list various facts, such as the fact that the Chinese people's hearts are not confused by this magic weapon and that the great powers related to East Asia are not affected by this magic weapon, etc., to prove it; just looking at the admission of a × country signed commentator, Ma Chang × Wu, can make it clear. Mabach Ren wrote an article called "Three Countries General Lessons and the Empire's Diplomacy" in the "Transformation" Three Magazine, which contained the following words.

"...Depending on the capture of Hankou and Guangzhou, the feelings of Britain and the United States temporarily tilted in favor of Japan. However, later the situation reversed, and the sympathy of Britain and the United States turned towards China. Isn't that because of taking the belief in the new order too much as a realistic diplomatic issue?...”

"...We Japanese cannot fully understand the meaning of the new order, and this inability to understand is a matter of course, because the person who explained this idea, who is also the Minister of Foreign Affairs, responded to the question of Nakajima Yadanji in the budget association of the House of Representatives, and also said, 'This concept of the East Asia new order will become more and more developed, and I think it seems that it should not be decided today that it has such and such a fixed meaning...' That is to say, the concept of the new order has only a dim reflection in the mind of the Minister of Foreign Affairs..."

"...I don't know what necessity the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has, actually exaggerating and promoting this thing (the new order) that does not yet exist in reality and whose outline is still vague, merely ×××× to frighten people, I really doubt it...""...To take hypothetical matters as topics for diplomatic negotiations is the most foolish of the foolish...""...Although grandiose talk is pleasant, if the country will suffer because of grandiose talk, then grandiose talk should be ×× be cautious.""...I therefore cannot help but think of the example of the Russo-Turkish War in 1877...At the Berlin Conference, Russia was forced to spit out most of his hard-won battle results. Russian representative Gorchakov died in grief and anger, and British representative Beaconsfield uttered the heroic words 'I have gained peace and glory together' upon arriving in Britain...Britain also obtained the island of Cyprus from Turkey as compensation, which was the fisherman's profit..."We can see from the lines of Ma Chang's article × chieftain's recklessness and × country intellectuals' grief and indignation towards reckless people.

Indeed, regarding the meaning of the "East Asia New Order," even though × people mobilized the "essence" of their cultural circles and wanted to find a more accessible, that is, a more easily deceptive explanation, there has been no result to this day. According to recent × magazine, the so-called "East Asia New Order" still has three explanations: (1) an East Asia alliance theory that emphasizes the nation-state as the basic unit of the new order, (2) an East Asia collaborative body theory that emphasizes ethnicity as the basic unit of the new order, and (3) the so-called Japanese "Manchurian" Chinese economic group theory, which emphasizes military and economic interests. On the surface, it seems that the second explanation is favored by a majority of theorists, but in fact the second one still takes the most labor, because this is the original intention of Japanese aggression. At the same time, in reality, it is still the fundamental origin of Japanese ××× facilities.

Regardless of which of these explanations will gain the majority of approval in the future, in any case, no matter which explanation is followed, the so-called "East Asia New Order" will not work and cannot be used to deceive people, because the so-called East Asia alliance theory fundamentally regards the pseudo-Manchuria, which has not become a nation, as an independent country, which is too deceitful. The so-called East Asia collaborative body theory fundamentally contradicts the fact that China is currently waging a war for national survival, and Japan × is plotting to conquer our entire nation. The so-called Japanese "Manchurian" Chinese economic group theory is obviously a pseudo-theory that Japan × wants to transform China into its economic colony. Therefore, all three cannot deceive any Chinese with political common sense, national consciousness, and economic common knowledge. As for the relationship between Japan × and other East Asian powers, the final result of the three explanations is that they are all characterized by East Asian × isolationism and anti-open doorism, which is naturally self-evident, so it cannot deceive the great powers related to East Asia, let alone.

Then, where exactly is the so-called "East Asia New Order" going? From common sense, I am afraid that there are only two paths: one is to turn back and go to the "East Asia Old Order" and compromise with Britain, the United States, and France, and the other is to advance to the "World New Order" and collude with Germany and Italy further. It seems that going back is not the glory of Japan, and the young soldiers of × people may not be willing, but in the anti-war atmosphere that is very ×, even people like ×× mentioned above who are more familiar with the political situation are publicly ××× before Japan's diplomatic future, saying that Britain will reap the fisherman's benefit today, it may not be impossible for the × cabinet to adopt it. According to the Hong Kong telegram of March 30, Hiranuma recently stated in his talk that "The basic principles of Japan's diplomatic policy have been decided by the previous cabinet and have not changed so far. However, the specific plan for these basic principles must be × changed in order to adapt to the changes in the international situation." This statement can be inferred that it already has the intention of turning back. Because, unless the so-called changes in the international situation refer to the changes in Europe, otherwise the changes in the Far East are only the point of Britain, the United States, and France actively assisting China, and this point, if speaking from the theory of the "East Asia New Order", it is not necessary to change its specific plan. If the specific plan on foreign policy must be changed superficially due to this point, then it is undoubtedly going back to the "East Asia Old Order." As for advancing to the "World New Order," this is an adventurous ××× when the "New Order" is certain to fail. From ×××'s ×××××××××××××× words, it is of course possible. ×××'s attack on Hainan Island last month, the recent attack in Jiangxi, and × chieftain's telegram to congratulate × Annexing Czechoslovakia, etc., can all serve as evidence.

After the "East Asia New Order" fails, which path will ×× take after all? The "East Asia Old Order," or the "World × Order"? This naturally depends on how the objective international environment changes before it can be determined, but what we can predict here is that no matter which path ×× takes, it will also fail in the same way; because, if it goes back, then Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, which have already begun to actually assist China, will not cooperate with ×× in vain just because × people show weakness, allowing it to grow stronger; similarly, if it takes the × second path, then in the Far East, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, compelled by practical needs, will further intensify their unity, causing ×× to fall into a de facto state of encirclement in the Far East.

"When ×× brought out this magic ×, its failure was determined." This sentence is really famous!

### Public Organizations in Suiyuan

Introduction

[Suiyuan Dispatch] The name "Brotherhood" (哥老會) is probably known to everyone, but what role has this organization played in society? What is its content? Apart from insiders, very few people know clearly, especially since it has gradually declined in recent years due to the influence of the current situation and social changes. Not many people understand it anymore, and most people regard the Brotherhood as a ×× organization. This view is very wrong.

At this critical moment of national survival, in order to win the victory of the War of Resistance, we must not only strive to develop tangible forces, but at the same time, we must not ignore various social secret organizations that represent intangible forces. Speaking of this, we cannot help but think of the Brotherhood and its important position in the history of national revolutionary struggles.

Everyone knows about the Green Gang (靑紅幫), and the Brotherhood is a branch of the Green Gang. At the beginning of its emergence, its greatest significance was to oppose the Qing Dynasty and restore the Ming Dynasty in terms of national identity, and to fight the rich and help the poor in terms of people's livelihood. At that time, it was equivalent to the peripheral organization of the Green Gang, assuming the duties of transporting grain officers. Its actions were relatively public. Its task for the national revolution was economic overall planning and assistance, while the Green Gang was responsible for promoting the national revolution with armed force. Therefore, these two organizations were one and two, inseparable from each other at the time. However, due to social relations, the Green Gang gradually became estranged from the Red Gang, and even transformed from estrangement into two seemingly different organizations. The Red Gang is today's Brotherhood. What I want to introduce here is the Brotherhood of Suiyuan, but I must also mention the Brotherhood of northwestern Shanxi, because the Brotherhood of northwestern Shanxi has a close relationship with the Brotherhood of Suiyuan.

History

The Brotherhood of Suiyuan originated during the Guangxu period (1875-1908). At that time, it was presided over by a man named Yang Shan, who came from Gansu to Wuyuan (五臨) – the Hetao region. He tried to promote it among the people, but at that time, people were not interested in it. After several efforts, he failed to create a force. He once started a "mountain" (開山, meaning to establish a branch), recruiting some brothers, but it still did not develop smoothly. Therefore, the Brotherhood in Suiyuan was still in its infancy and did not attract the attention of the general public. It was not until the fifth year of the Republic of China (1916) that Mr. Gao Zhiqing from northern Shaanxi promoted it in northern Shaanxi. Many people responded at that time, so Mr. Gao held a "mountain opening" ceremony. The "mountain" opened was D青山 (Da Qingshan), the hall name was "Baozhen Hall" (保眞堂), the water was "Coral Water" (珊瑚水), and the incense was "Jin incense" (晉　香). Mr. Gao was the "dragon head" (龍頭, meaning leader), also known as the "mountain master" (山主). This "mountain master" still lives in the village, and he is a very kind old man. Everyone calls him "Brother Gao" when they meet him. He is now assisting Deng Wenshan, the commander of the 21st Army Corps, in doing resistance work. After he started the "mountain opening," the Brotherhood in northern Shaanxi was organized, and the number of people increased day by day, and the labor force expanded day by day. At that time, among his brothers, there was a Mr. Yang Wanzhen, who was from Suiyuan, and he was highly appreciated by Mr. Gao, so he sent Mr. Yang to work in Suiyuan. After Mr. Yang returned to Suiyuan, the situation in Suiyuan was no longer what it used to be. Everyone had a better understanding of the Brotherhood, so many people responded. Therefore, Mr. Yang Wanzhen opened the Wutai Mountain in the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921). The hall name was "Tongwu Hall" (同武堂), the water was "Tuo Water" (沱水), and the incense was "Yanmen Incense" (雁門香). Mr. Yang was the "dragon head." "Little Five Yang" (小五楊) was Mr. Yang Wanzhen's nickname. After the Brotherhood was organized by him this time, it developed very rapidly. Almost every family had his brothers. Once, Ma Fuxiang, the military governor of Suiyuan, asked him: "How many brothers do you have?" He replied: "I don't know either, but wherever there is a chimney, there are my brothers." From his very simple answer, we can know that the power of the Brotherhood was already very strong at that time. I still remember that when Mr. Yang gave his eldest child, Yang Yiming, married, the number of people who sent gifts was really countless. At the banquet, banquet tickets were issued, and people could enter the hall with tickets. The dishes were served in a flowing manner, starting from the morning and continuing until night. As for the gifts, taking the rings alone, they were measured in "tubes" (筒), and there were more than one stone (石) of them, which is about 120 pounds. It is conceivable how grand the celebration was. Unfortunately, heaven did not grant him long life. Mr. Yang passed away in the winter of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China (1925). After Mr. Yang's death, due to the lack of talent to continue leading, it turned into a leaderless situation, so he had to close the "mountain entrance" (山口, meaning branch).

The Brotherhood led by Mr. Yang at this stage was completely based on the character "危" (wēi, danger), belonging to the Northwest Hall (西北堂), so it was also called the "West Branch" (西號). If the brothers of the "West Branch" met on the road, A would ask B: "Where are you from?" B would answer: "From the west." A would also ask: "Where are you going?" B would answer: "To the west." This kind of question and answer method was completely a secret code, because no matter where you came from or where you were going, you would answer "from the west" and "to the west." Originally, there was also the Sanyuantang (三元常) Brotherhood, which belonged to the character "德" (dé, virtue) and belonged to the East Branch (東號). It is said that the "dragon head" at that time was Shi Yushan, who has already passed away. Because the author is not very clear about the internal situation of the East Branch, I cannot provide a detailed introduction. However, regardless of the West Branch or the East Branch, their methods and content were completely the same, only the leaders were different!

In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China (1926), Mr. Feng Huancao arrived in Baotou and saw the great potential of the Brotherhood, so he wanted to reorganize it as an invisible labor force for the revolution, and abolished the "dragon head" system, changing the Brotherhood to the National Association (國民協會). Mr. Feng served as the chairman and did not hold a "mountain opening" ceremony. Although the content of the National Association was slightly more advanced than that of the true Brotherhood, it was generally the same as the content of the Brotherhood. After the National Association was established, it was also very prosperous for a time, and many people participated. The organization that was originally in a leaderless state was revived vigorously. Unfortunately, the morale of the National Association was placed on Mr. Feng alone, and not on the organization. Therefore, when Mr. Feng retreated in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), the National Association also collapsed with the military retreat. After that, the Brotherhood fell into a slump again. Not only did it lose its original meaning, but it also gradually went astray. In the beginning, there was no robbery among the people in the Brotherhood, but later some "Tu Yu" (土玉, meaning local gangsters) emerged, who did not care whether you were a member or not, and would engage in "big fish eat small fish" and "big shrimp eat small shrimp," stripping you clean. These people were mostly from the East Branch. It cannot be said that there were none from the West Branch, but they were fewer compared to the East Branch. From then on, the Brotherhood, which was of great significance, simply became a ×× name!

In the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (1933), when Mr. Sun Dianying stationed troops in Baotou, he once again advocated the restoration of the Brotherhood organization. Mr. Sun's intention was to correct its erroneous behavior of going into banditry on the one hand, and on the other hand, he wanted to revitalize this invisible force and use it as an assistant for his own work. Later, because Mr. Sun's plan did not succeed, the revival of the Brotherhood also became an illusion! From then on, no one mentioned or cared about the term "Brotherhood" anymore!

Last year, the War of Resistance broke out. In the first phase of the War of Resistance, tangible forces were used to fight the Japanese devils, and the results were very unsatisfactory. From the lessons of blood, we progressed to the all-out War of Resistance, that is, combining tangible forces with intangible forces to achieve the goal of depleting the Japanese devils. Therefore, after the start of the second phase of the War of Resistance, some people noticed the importance of cultivating intangible forces, and at the same time realized that the Brotherhood organization was not a bandit, but a popular group with the most valuable, meaningful, and effective history in the Chinese nation's struggle for liberation. Therefore, in the past six months, although there has been no mobilization in the Suiyuan × area, some people have indeed been advocating it in northwestern Shanxi several times. These people who advocated it are all Suiyuan people who do not want to be slaves to a foreign country, or people who are related to Suiyuan. Although they are advocating it with heart, it has only become more concrete recently. The "mountain master" is a man surnamed Li, who has obtained the support of a certain military leader and is working hard to carry it out. However, I dare not predict in advance whether it can grow and prosper as desired, because they still have many shortcomings in terms of personnel and methods. Perhaps these shortcomings can prevent the development of the Brotherhood organization.

Creed

The mission of the Brotherhood was clearly stated long ago: to oppose the Qing Dynasty and restore the Ming Dynasty, and to fight the rich and help the poor. It has no fixed doctrine, but it has a fixed creed to maintain the unity of the brothers. This creed is the eight characters of filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, using these eight characters as the foundation of their unity. Therefore, if someone asks: "What do you Brotherhood rely on?" All the Brotherhood people will answer in unison: "We rely on the foundation of the deep mountains, the Qi wind of Wagang, and the righteousness of Taoyuan." Every brother of the Brotherhood must occupy one of these eight characters. If you cannot occupy one of the characters, you cannot be a bachelor (光棍, also meaning member)!

[Note]: (Members of the Brotherhood are also called "brothers" (弟兄) or "bachelors" (光棍).)

Organization

There is a bold statement in the Brotherhood: "The Qing Dynasty has ten thousand miles of territory, and the Brotherhood has ten generations of people." This means that the Brotherhood relies on these ten generations of people to overcome the ten thousand miles of territory of the Qing Dynasty. These ten generations of people are "危德福自實松柏一支鮮" (wēi dé fú zì shí sōng bǎi yī zhī xiān). The Brotherhood of the West Branch is the "危" (wēi) generation, the East Branch is the "德" (dé) generation, the Sanyuantang is the "福" (fú) generation, the Sixitang (四喜堂) is the "自" (zì) generation, and the Wufutang (五福堂) is the "宣" (xuān) generation. However, although the generations from "德" (dé) onwards have their names, they do not have concrete compositions. Therefore, the so-called ten generations of people in the Brotherhood still only have the "危" (wēi) and "德" (dé) generations.

The internal organization is divided into internal and external departments. The internal person in charge include the "dragon head" (山主, mountain master), deputy "dragon head," "zheng tang" (正堂, main hall), "xiang zhang" (香長, incense master), "zuo tang" (左堂, left hall), "pei tang" (陪堂, accompanying hall), "li tang" (禮堂, ceremony hall), "zhi tang" (智堂, wisdom hall), and "xing tang" (行堂, action hall). These are called the "inner eight bachelor's" (內八部光棍). There are also the "outer eight bachelor's" (外八部光棍), which are industry, "dang jia" (當家, housekeeper), "guan shi" (管事, manager), "xun feng" (巡風, patrol wind), "xun shan" (巡山, patrol mountain), "jiang kou" (江口, river mouth), "lao gong" (老公, old man). In addition, there are the "four famous mountains" (四大名山) and four people. These four people are like advisors and consultants, calling the "inner eight bachelor's" "big brother" (大哥). Among the "outer eight bachelor's," in addition to the industry calling them "big brother," the "dang jia" is "old three" (老三), the "guan shi" is "old five" (老五), the "xun feng" is "old six" (老六), the "xun shan" is "old eight" (老八), the "jiang kou" is "old nine" (老九), and the "lao gong" is "old ten" (老十). There is no "old two" (老二) because "old two" is a taboo for Guan Shengdi (關聖帝, God of War), so no one dares to be it. "Old four" (老四) and "old seven" (老七) have both surrendered to the Qing Dynasty, so they are also vacant. "Lao yao" (老么) is the smallest, and "lao yao" is divided into "big lao yao" (大老么) and "small lao yao" (小老么). All bachelors who have just joined are "small lao yao," and they gradually rise step by step. Among the "outer eight bachelor's," "guan shi" and "dang jia" are the most important and the most difficult to promote. The "guan shi" has to go through five steps to be promoted. When promoted from "xun feng" to "guan shi," they are first promoted to "apprentice," called "apprentice guan shi" (學習管事). Promoted from "apprentice" to "yellow flag," called "yellow flag guan shi" (黃旗管事). Promoted from "yellow flag" to "black flag," called "black flag guan shi" (黑旗管事). Promoted from "black flag" to "general manager," and managed the red flag, called "red flag guan shi" (紅旗管事). This "red flag guan shi" is the most authoritative "guan shi" in the Brotherhood. The "dang jia" also has to go through five steps to be promoted. When promoted from "red flag guan shi" to "dang jia," they are first promoted to "wearing red," then promoted to "earning flowers," and then promoted to "empress." The "empress" is the most authoritative "dang jia." It is reasonable for the "dragon head" to be promoted from the "zheng tang," but sometimes there are those who are not promoted according to the rules. Therefore, there is a "donation" system in the Brotherhood. All bachelors who are not promoted according to the rules, due to human relationships or other circumstances, are promoted to a higher level, which is called "donation" (捐納). Although the functions of those who obtain positions through donation are the same, in terms of resume, they are not as upright and aboveboard. Assuming that someone obtains a position through donation and does not remain loyal to the group, but instead pursues personal fame and fortune outside, they are considered despicable bachelors in the Brotherhood. This kind of bachelor is called "wealth bringing boy" (招財童子). The equivalent term is "value bachelor" (價值光棍), which refers to a bachelor who is promoted step by step according to the rules.

In addition, in the organizational method of the Brotherhood, there are also more important things, which are the "four beams and four pillars" (四槡四柱). What is called the "four beams"? It is the four characters of "mountain, water, incense, hall." What mountain, what water, what incense, what hall must be determined in each organization. What is called the "four pillars"? It is grace, worship, recommendation, introduction. This method is completely used for personnel promotion. In other words, it is the method and procedure used for personnel promotion.

Discipline

In addition to leaders, organization, and creed, the Brotherhood also has iron discipline. This iron discipline is divided into three types, totaling thirty articles. The first is the "red ten articles" (紅十條). Those who violate the articles of the "red ten articles" are not dealt with by others. Therefore, the method of disposal they set is called "dig your own pit and jump in yourself" (自己掘坑自已跳), which means to bury yourself alive. The second is the "black ten articles" (黑十條). Those who violate the articles of the "black ten articles" are also dealt with by themselves. Therefore, what it sets is "take your own knife and stab yourself" (自巳拿刀自己剽), which means to kill yourself with a knife. The third is the "yellow ten articles" (黃十條). Those who violate these articles are dealt with more lightly, which is "forty red sticks will not spare" (四十紅棍定不饒).

The spirit of discipline of the Brotherhood is that they can deal with themselves. This kind of spirit has not been seen not only in secret societies, but also in formal political parties. The so-called iron discipline is only seen in the Brotherhood.

Conclusion

I have roughly introduced the situation of the Brotherhood, but because everything here is confidential and it is still going on in secret, I cannot write it out nakedly. At the same time, this kind of organization has no documentary research, only relying on the memory in my brain, so there are certainly many errors, which need to be corrected in the future.

Our future strategy for winning the protracted war against the Japanese devils cannot rely solely on tangible forces. Judging from the current situation, the opportunity to launch a major battle in the future is even less. The best tactic for confronting the Japanese devils is undoubtedly guerrilla warfare. The only condition for advancing from guerrilla warfare to developing mobile warfare and consuming the Japanese devils in the long term is to enable the guerrillas to be closely integrated with the people.

To achieve this goal, we must strengthen civil organizations and enable the inherent civil organizations to exert the greatest strength.

The Brotherhood is the strongest and most widespread inherent civil organization in our society. It grew up among the people and relied on the spirit of that civil organization to survive for many years and fight for many years under the rule of alien enemies. Today, under the topic of "organizing the people," how to make the Brotherhood's labor force contribute to the War of Resistance is a question that we should pay close attention to.

### Our Guangdong Army Captures Xinhui The Battle on the Jiangxi-Hunan Highway is Fierce ×'s Attempted Crossing of the Jin River is Completely Annihilated

[Central News Agency on the 24th, Telegram from Chongqing on the 6th] Regarding Xinhui, our counter-attacking troops are in high spirits. On the afternoon of the 5th, our army directly attacked the city of Xinhui, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the ×. The fighting was very fierce. At 7:30 PM, our army stormed into the city, sweeping away the remnants of the × and dispatching troops to pursue them closely.

[Central News Agency, Zhangshu, 6th] Since the ×'s southward advance from Gao'an, they are still attempting to cross the Jin River stealthily. In the afternoon and evening of the 5th and this morning, under the cover of poison gas and artillery fire, they secretly entered the Jin River three times, attempting to build pontoon bridges. However, each time they were completely annihilated by our political death squads. The × suffered more than 100 casualties.

[Central News Agency, Zhangshu, 6th] On the afternoon of the 4th, dozens of × cavalry were discovered west of Gao'an. Our army immediately surrounded them, killing more than ten × and injuring more than ten × horses. The × collapsed and fled back to Gao'an.

[Central News Agency, Xiushui, 6th] On the 3rd, × artillery continuously bombarded the small area on the south bank of the Xiu River (south of Wuning) with more than a thousand shells, and also bombarded the northwest mountainous area for a long time.

Sweeping Campaign in Zhongtiao Mountains

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 4th] (Delayed) On the 1st, each regiment of our division, Jia, Sun, and Chen, dispatched a portion of their forces to counterattack the × at Dagounan Daodong Village from Xiaogounan ×××××. At around 1:00 AM, Regiment Commander Jia led his troops to occupy Dagounan. While searching the western end of the village, they engaged in fierce fighting with the ×, engaging in hand-to-hand combat for about an hour. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. At the same time, our Chen Regiment also encountered the × between Daodong Village and Dagounan. Until 7:00 AM, they were still in a stalemate with the ×. At dawn, our ××× and ×××× artillery concentrated their firepower to bombard the × at Dagounan Daodong Village. At the same time, the defending troops in various places in Xiaogou Fuyue Village continued to counterattack the × desperately. The fighting was extremely fierce, and the fighting continued until 12:00 noon. A portion of the ×, about 500 strong, at Ershiling, attacked the eastern and western villages at around 4:00 AM to support their × at Dagou. Our Sun Regiment's battalion met them near Zhujia Kiln and engaged them fiercely. After a stalemate until 4:00 PM, the × were unable to withstand and fled back to Ershiling. At 1:00 PM that day, after our ××× and ×× added reinforcements, they shifted their offensive. The × were caught in an ambush by our army and suffered heavy casualties. Our army recaptured Dagounan at 3:00 PM. At the same time, a portion of our Jia Regiment also pursued them. The × were unable to withstand and fled towards Monan Town. We also recaptured the two villages of Dadongkeng and Nankeng. At 5:00 PM, we also recaptured Monan Town. The × fled in droves, one group of about a thousand people, with more than three hundred wounded soldiers, fled to Jie County via Shililing, and another group of about seven or eight hundred people, with more than two hundred wounded soldiers, fled back to Yongji via Jinpin Village. The southern part of the Zhongtiao Mountains has been cleared. In this battle, we destroyed artillery pieces, captured several light and heavy machine guns, more than twenty horses, and a large number of military supplies. About two hundred × corpses were left west of Monan Town. Our army's casualties are still being tallied.

[Min Ge She, Xingji, 6th] Zhou Mingyu, the platoon leader of a certain guerrilla detachment of our army in central Shanxi, led 30 soldiers from Fenyang to Jiaocheng the day before yesterday. When passing through Fengjiayadi in Jiaocheng, they detected that more than a thousand united × were returning to Fenyang from Wucheng. The platoon immediately ambushed on the back of the mountain at Fengjiayadi, letting the × vanguard pass by, and when the main force arrived, they fired fiercely at the × with intense firepower, killing many ×. The × vanguard, upon hearing the news, immediately returned to besiege us. Our 30 soldiers occupied three mountain tops, forming mutual support, and fought the × to the death. Although the × were numerous, they could not advance a step. The fierce battle continued until night, and because the ammunition was exhausted, they fell into an encirclement. Our Platoon Leader Zhou was seriously injured, with only one hand grenade left in his hand, but he still fought hard. Soon, more than a dozen × approached within close range. Platoon Leader Zhou immediately pulled the fuse of the hand grenade and died together with the ×, making a heroic sacrifice. Five soldiers also died at the same time, and most of them broke through the encirclement and escaped. It is estimated that more than a hundred × were killed before and after. The commander here, after hearing the report, praised the platoon leader for leading a platoon of soldiers to resist such a large ×, and was able to kill more than four times as many ×, and ultimately made a heroic sacrifice, which is truly a glory for the nation and a model for the anti-Japanese soldiers. He was specially approved to be promoted by two ranks, and the Central Government was requested to issue a circular to all armies to commend him.

### Overview of the Week's War Situation – March 30th to April 5th – Announced by the Military Affairs Commission

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission discussed this week's (March 30th to April 5th) battles, which were more active than last week's. In the previous week's battle in northern Jiangxi, although our troops in Nanchang made a strategic retreat, the [Japanese] suffered heavy casualties, and their elite forces were wiped out. Their last-ditch conspiracy was completely crushed by us. It is evident that the anger of our army and the people at home, along with the demoralization, wavering, and panic of the soldiers on the front lines, have reached an extreme point. To conceal their undeniable defeat, the [Japanese] army on all fronts has shown signs of frenzy this week. However, our brave soldiers met them head-on with fierce attacks, causing the [Japanese] to flee in disarray and become further mired. The general outline of what happened is described as follows:

Guangdong Front

There were no changes along the battle lines of the Yuehan, Guangzhou-Kowloon, and Guangzhou routes. More than 2,000 [Japanese] soldiers, with more than 20 tanks, advancing from Jiujiang towards Shaoping, supported by air power, and personally commanded by [Japanese] unit commander Eda Matsu, came with fierce momentum. This week, they repeatedly engaged our forces in fierce battles at Dakeng, Qiushushan, and Xiaoshanling. At the same time, the [Japanese] army also appeared to launch fierce attacks on Jiangmen from the north in two directions, attempting to realize their delusional dream of breaking through Zhongshan. Shaping North Street and Jiangmen were once lost on March 31st and April 1st. Later, our army, with a spirit of certain death, launched a large-scale counterattack, completely defeating the [Japanese], killing over 1,500. [Japanese] unit commander Eda Matsu and squad leader Naoki were also killed. All of these places were completely recovered. The [Japanese] who retreated to Jiujiang numbered only a hundred or so, and the remaining troops are still scattered, and it will not be difficult to wipe them out (Note: It has now been lost again). On the southern front, off the coast of Fangcheng, [Japanese] warships attempted to land at Qisha twice on March 31st, under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire. After a fierce counterattack from our defending forces, the [Japanese] abandoned two of their landing craft and fled back to their ships. The area is now calm and without incident. On the same day, several hundred [Japanese] with several tanks in Ding'an, Hainan Island, advanced through Leiming City, encountering strong resistance from our army. After five hours of fierce fighting, the [Japanese] were unable to withstand it and collapsed, retreating towards Ding'an. Our army then captured Leiming City.

Northern Jiangxi Front

Since our army abandoned Nanchang and Wuning last week, we have been arranging an encirclement of the [Japanese]. The [Japanese] aggression, having recently achieved gains, has been blunted. Starting from [date unclear], our army launched a full-scale counterattack. The [Japanese] in the Nanchang area have been blocked north of Liantang and have made no progress. In the Gao'an area, our and the [Japanese] armies engaged in fierce battles successively at Zhanggunao, Xiangfuguan, Shanzili, and other places. Under our fierce artillery fire, the [Japanese] left corpses piled up like hills. By the morning of the 3rd, after achieving our goal of attrition, we had already shifted to advantageous areas, making it extremely difficult for the [Japanese] to succeed. As for our army's counterattack on Wuning, on the afternoon of the 2nd, with the momentum of breaking bamboo, they valiantly advanced towards the [Japanese] at Hushan, Changlunshang. The [Japanese] stubbornly resisted from their fortified positions, and fierce fighting lasted for a long time. The [Japanese] front collapsed, and they fled towards Wuning. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue, killing countless [Japanese]. On the morning of the [date unclear], a large part of the [Japanese] came to reinforce, and after fierce head-on attacks and repeated charges, they were defeated one by one. On the 4th, they continued to track and advance throughout the day and were approaching the southern outskirts of Wuning, pressing on the city walls. The [Japanese] inside the city were in a state of panic.

Shanxi Front

This week, the [Japanese] in the Anyi, Yuncheng, and Shuiji areas of southern Shanxi launched fierce attacks on our Zhongtiao Mountain positions along several routes. One route, with over 3,000 [Japanese], advanced towards Dachencun. Another route, with over 2,000 [Japanese], attacked Monanzhen. Another route, with over 1,000 [Japanese], attacked Nancun. All routes had [Japanese] aircraft assisting in the battle, attempting to seize important points such as Maojindu and Pinglu, which was very aggressive. Our army relied on advantageous terrain to fiercely counterattack. The intensity of the fierce battles of repeated contention was the greatest seen in the area in recent months. Dachencun, Monanzhen, and Nancun were lost and regained twice. Ultimately, due to the brave and bloody battles of our officers and soldiers, the [Japanese] troops were defeated. All of these places are now in our possession. In the battle of Dachencun, the [Japanese] suffered over 1,200 casualties. In the battle of Nancun, a [Japanese] plane was shot down, and both the plane and the crew were destroyed. The [Japanese] main force has been severely damaged and has been almost completely sacrificed. Currently, our army in Maojindu, Pinglu, and other places is in high spirits. In Yicheng, Xiyangqu in eastern Shanxi, and near Jingle in northern Shanxi, our and the [Japanese] armies also engaged in repeated fierce battles this week. The [Japanese] army, with several thousand troops, advanced towards us in several directions. Under our courageous resistance, the [Japanese] suffered heavy losses and fled. Most of the [Japanese] army in Jingle has fled towards Xinxian County. By the afternoon of the 4th, after repeated fierce sieges by us, they had once broken into the city. The remaining [Japanese] stubbornly resisting in the city number only a few hundred and will not be difficult to eliminate.

Hubei-Hunan Front

Our and the [Japanese] armies in central Hubei and on both banks of the Xiang River are still facing each other across the river, with occasional artillery battles. The [Japanese] who invaded Nanhedu from Hanchuan were defeated by our three-pronged counterattack on the 1st. The remaining [Japanese] retreated back to Hanchuan, and we recovered the lost territory. On the same day, the [Japanese] in [place unclear] advanced towards Luojiadian and Henglin, but were bravely repulsed, with over a hundred [Japanese] killed. Another unit of the [Japanese] army attempted to attack Zhangjiachang and Lundu, but was severely attacked by our army, and the [Japanese] suffered heavy casualties and failed. Attempting to attack [place unclear], our army, after recovering key points such as Wangzhuang and Ba around the city, entered the area on the 3rd and killed many [Japanese] soldiers. On the same day, a part of our army in southern Hubei captured Qigushan, inflicting heavy losses on the [Japanese]. In northern Hunan, after our army captured Xinkaitang near Yueyang once last week, the [Japanese] suffered heavy losses. This week, they sent large reinforcements to launch a fierce counterattack. After several days of fierce fighting, we won a great victory, killing over 2,000 [Japanese]. Currently, there are no [Japanese] troops in Xinkaitang and Matang. Our army is pursuing the victory, pressing directly on the outskirts of Yueyang, combining forces to attack the county seat. The remaining [Japanese] are still stubbornly resisting, and the fighting is extremely fierce.

(To be continued tomorrow)

### Ban on Shipping Supplies to Shanghai to Support the [Japanese]: Ministry of Economic Affairs Promulgates Measures; Shipments to Concessions to be Handled According to Law; Paper, Charcoal, Tea, Eggs, etc. Exempted from the Ban

[Local News] The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently sent a telegram to chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities, stating, "Regarding the ban on shipping supplies to Shanghai to support the [Japanese], the Ministry has consulted with relevant agencies and agreed on review measures. Before these measures are implemented, in order to provide emergency relief, provisional approval for inspection and release upon providing a guarantee is granted, as previously informed by telegram. The review measures for shipping banned supplies to Shanghai to support the [Japanese] have now been promulgated and implemented. Hereafter, all banned supplies destined for the Shanghai Concession area should be handled in accordance with these measures. The emergency relief measures stipulated in the Ministry's previous telegram are hereby abolished. However, requests for transshipment of bamboo, wood, paper, charcoal, tea, firewood, eggs, and other items to Shanghai are exempted from the ban. A copy of the review measures for shipping banned supplies to Shanghai to support the [Japanese] is attached for your information." The Ministry of Economic Affairs stipulated the following review measures for shipping banned supplies to Shanghai: (1) Shipments of banned supplies to Shanghai are limited to the Concession area. (2) The intended use of banned supplies shipped to Shanghai is limited to supply to Chinese or Allied factories, or for local people's daily needs.

(4) The certificates mentioned in the preceding two paragraphs should be submitted to the Agricultural and Commercial Bureau, or the Factory Adjustment Office, or the Resources Committee, or the Trade Committee, depending on the nature of the supplies, for review and transfer to the Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs for approval.

### Pessimistic About the Future of the Invasion of China, [Japanese] Pseudo-Government Shifts Anger to Britain; [Japanese] Newspapers Launch Vigorous Attacks on Britain; Slogans Posted by Pseudo-Police Near the Shanghai Concession

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 5th] The Japanese-run "Mainichi Shimbun" criticized British aid to China today, saying, "British aid to China will only prolong the war and increase the suffering of the people. Britain's assistance to General Chiang Kai-shek is solely for the purpose of maintaining its own interests. As for the Soviet Union, its only intention is to Sovietize China. The interference of Britain and the Soviet Union in Japan's China policy has destroyed the relationship of friendly cooperation between China and Japan."

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 6th] Police officers from the pseudo-"Datong Municipal Government" here recently posted large anti-British slogans in the Japanese-occupied areas adjacent to the Public Concession. These are clearly visible from within the Concession.

### Changchun Announces Details of Soviet-Japanese Conflict

[Reuters, Changchun, 5th] Tonight, it was announced here that Soviet troops attacked Liuka, north of Manzhouli. After two days of fighting, three Japanese soldiers were killed. It is claimed that the Soviet troops were equipped with three cannons and light and heavy machine guns, but were repulsed by the Japanese army. The number of their losses is unknown. The total number of troops participating in the conflict on both sides was between two and three hundred.

### Progress of the Henan-Hubei War

[Central News Agency, Zaoyang, 6th] (1) A unit of our army, launching from Dashan Mountain, is currently attacking Pingjingguan and Wushengguan, making considerable progress. In addition to killing and capturing over 20 [Japanese] soldiers, they also seized two machine guns. (2) The [Japanese] entrenched in Xihe were attacked by our forces, resulting in the death of over 50 [Japanese] soldiers. There are reports that Xihe has been recovered.

### Thorough Cooperation Between Soldiers and Civilians in Shanxi Province; Peasants Rapidly Organizing Armed Forces; Japanese Prisoners Join Hands with Us, Vowing to Kill the Common Enemy

[Reuters Special Correspondent, Shanxi Battlefield] A reporter in a remote area of Shanxi Province unexpectedly encountered three Japanese prisoners. All three are now working as translators of political texts for the Chinese army. The reporter was traveling with a certain division commander of the Chinese army to a guerrilla area. Around noon, we arrived at a mountain village and stopped for inspection. We were led around for sightseeing and introduced to the Japanese prisoners. The Japanese prisoners were all wearing light blue Chinese uniforms and were indistinguishable from other staff members in the village. The Japanese prisoners seen were all Japanese farmers. A Korean interpreter provided translation. One Japanese prisoner said that his father was a farmer and was drafted into the army. He was trained as a truck driver and assigned to China. The other two also claimed to be truck drivers and said that they were lost and captured near Linfen in southern Shanxi. In response to the reporter's questions, they all said that the treatment by the Chinese side was very generous. When the reporter asked them to express their opinions, all three had tears in their eyes. They looked at each other for a moment before one of them mustered the courage to speak: "This war is really due to Japanese imperialism. China is fighting for justice and peace." They all believed that Japan would soon go bankrupt and that China would win a victory, and a merciful victory. The Japanese prisoners also said that they all felt worried because, according to Japanese law, soldiers are not allowed to return to their country once they are captured.

During this trip through Shanxi and Shaanxi, the reporter noticed two things in particular: (1) the people's determination to resist Japan, and (2) the extremely thorough methods of organizing peasants politically and militarily. Each village has a political education center engaged in organizing meetings, speeches, and plays, as well as posting slogans. Even the smallest villages are assisted by the larger villages nearby in carrying out various tasks. These larger towns often have offices of the "Sacrifice to Save the Nation Association" and other organizations to carry out this work. In addition, local self-defense forces are used to teach the people the basics of military training in a more systematic manner than before. Therefore, peasants have contact with regular troops, and efforts are made to thoroughly cooperate between the military and the civilians. "The military and the civilians must unite" has become the most popular slogan in Shanxi Province, and the song of military-civilian cooperation can be heard at any time. The reporter tried to find a loophole in various gatherings, but could not find any, and only saw people enthusiastically engaged in various new war activities.

The reporter was the first member of the press to come to this remote area of Shanxi Province, so the people united to welcome him, saying that they were all engaged in the hard work of [unclear]. The local self-defense forces also automatically entertained the reporter. Some of them were armed with spears, while others were [unclear]. Currently, the farmers in various parts of Shanxi Province have an unusually harmonious relationship with the soldiers. The reporter saw a small squad of soldiers setting out on horseback and being warmly welcomed by the farmers everywhere, who treated them to food and provided various forms of assistance. Once, when the reporter and others stopped in the mountains, the people living in caves eagerly provided us with boiling water to quench our thirst and came to talk to us. When the reporter asked if they had any eggs, they quickly produced fifty. However, the soldiers insisted on paying for them. The situation where Chinese farmers voluntarily give food to soldiers, while the soldiers insist on paying for it, would have been unbelievable not long ago. When the reporter needed a guide, several young people volunteered to serve.

Once, while crossing the Yellow River, the division commander and the reporter stood side by side on the bank. The division commander pointed to the deep gorge beside the river and said, "Japan is as strong as these rocks, while China is as weak as the ice on the river. But one day, we will destroy these rocks, just like the Yellow River does." (March 20th, from the army)

### Eliminate Traitors and Collaborators! Issue an Arrest Warrant for Wang Jingwei! Suggestions from the Communist Party Newspaper to the Authorities

[Reuters, Chongqing, 6th] Today, the Chinese Communist Party's newspaper, "Xinhua Daily," published an article demanding that the Chinese government issue an arrest warrant for Wang Jingwei and his henchmen in Hong Kong and Hanoi, and arrest "pro-Wang elements within the government." The newspaper declared, "Only by fundamentally eliminating these elements can we hope to achieve final victory in this war of resistance." The newspaper also listed the following individuals as "Wang's confidants": former Minister of Propaganda Zhou Fohai, former Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, former legislator Lin Baisheng, former Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, writer Tao Xisheng, former Director-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Li Shengwu, and former Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Gao Zongwu.

[Local News] Yesterday, the "Hong Kong Telegraph" reported that after the exposure of Wang's plot to collaborate with Japan, the Chinese community was very indignant. Gao, a former important official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who was reportedly tasked by Wang to go to Japan, has now returned to Hong Kong.

### Our Guerrilla Forces Densely Deployed Around Wuhan, Actively Operating Under the Leadership of County Magistrates; The [Japanese] Army Is Afraid to Provoke Them

[Associated Press, Hankou, 6th] According to highly reliable sources, the Chinese guerrilla forces in the Wuhan area are now operating actively under the leadership of county magistrates, organized by county. Their most important task at present is to eliminate bandits in the countryside, as banditry has increased due to the Japanese occupation. The guerrilla forces have now issued an ultimatum to the bandits, ordering them to quickly surrender, repent, and join the guerrilla forces in resisting Japan under discipline. Otherwise, they must hand over their weapons to the guerrilla forces and quickly return to their farms. It is understood that the results so far are very good. The guerrilla forces are now operating in the Japanese-occupied areas of Wuhan as if in no man's land, and the Japanese garrison has never dared to provoke them.

### French Government Considering Cooperation with the Soviet Union to Further Assist Our Country; French Ambassador in Chongqing Had Lengthy Talks with Our Authorities; Meeting Between British Ambassadors in the Far East Raises Speculation

[Shanghai, 6th] The British ambassadors to China and Japan met in Luohe yesterday to discuss the situation in the Far East. There is much speculation about the content of the talks. It is reported that the French Ambassador to China, Cosme, is currently en route to Shanghai. He had a three-hour meeting with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing. It is rumored that the French government is now considering cooperating with the Soviet Union to provide further assistance to China. It is expected that after the French Ambassador arrives here, he will have talks with Ambassadors Craigie and Kerr.

[Local News] British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr will arrive in Hong Kong next Sunday (the 9th) by ship from Shanghai and is expected to arrive around the 13th. After a short stay in Hong Kong, he will fly to Chongqing by China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) to pay respects to our highest authorities. Ambassador Kerr met with British Ambassador to Japan Craigie in Shanghai and discussed the situation in the Far East and exchanged views. It is also rumored that this meeting between the two ambassadors in Shanghai and Kerr's flight to Chongqing are of great significance. Furthermore, British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Army General Lionel Smith accompanied by his aide-de-camp St. John and Brigadier Thompson, took the British warship HMS Moorhen to Australia yesterday morning to pay an official visit to the Acting Governor of Australia, Army Commander Cowie, who was given a grand welcome by the Australian side. The Governor also boarded the warship to return the visit, and both sides exchanged pleasantries. General Smith returned to Hong Kong on the same ship at 6 pm yesterday. Also, French Ambassador to China Cosme took the French mail ship Général Février from Hong Kong to Shanghai the other day. Unfortunately, the ship collided with the Guangdong-bound ship and returned to Hong Kong. The French ambassador then transferred to the French Navy transport ship Taitot yesterday morning to Shanghai.

### Cai Jinhua's Escape; Leading Her Troops to Break Through; Leaving Behind Clothing and Footwear to Create a False Impression

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 6th] A young staff officer in the Anhui Province guerrilla forces, who was wounded in southern Anhui, recently told an Associated Press reporter at the Municipal Hospital here about the recent situation of the famous female guerrilla commander Cai Jinhua, saying that the previous Japanese reports that Cai Jinhua died in December last year were completely inaccurate. When the Japanese army attacked Taihu, they obtained Cai's clothing and footwear in Changxing and assumed that Cai had died. In fact, Cai herself led the troops out of the encirclement on December 25th, and the clothing and footwear left behind were actually a deliberate deception. The Japanese side mistakenly took it as fact, found a female corpse, photographed it, and publicized it greatly, and even gave the corpse to their guard dogs as Christmas food, not knowing that Cai Jinhua put on a Japanese army uniform, disguised herself as a Japanese soldier, passed through the Japanese army defense line, and retreated to Anhui Province.

### The Case of [Japanese] Occupation of Storm Island; Once Debated in the British House of Commons; Undersecretary of State Pointed Out the Island's Important Position; Britain Still Maintaining Close Ties with France

[Reuters, London, 6th] Undersecretary of State Butler, in response to Mr. Mander's question in the House of Commons today regarding the status of Storm Island, said that the island was completely under French sovereignty in 1923. However, the Japanese government officially stated on the 30th of last month that the island was under the jurisdiction of the Taiwanese government. Mander further asked whether the British government should cooperate with the French government and protest to Japan, as Britain has an obligation to help protect French overseas territories now that Storm Island has been occupied. Butler replied that this was a matter for the French government, but the British government would maintain close contact with the French on this matter and other matters of common interest to Britain and France. Then Mr. Mann asked if Storm Island was not militarily important. Butler replied that the island was clearly of great military importance.

### The Demise of the X-People

— Chen Baoyin

One

In the past two weeks, due to significant changes in the European situation, the future of peace in Europe has become the focus of general attention. However, world peace is indivisible, so many people, while paying attention to the future of peace in Europe, are concerned about the impact of changes in the European situation on the Sino-Japanese War. Among them, some who do not fully understand the overall international situation have pessimistic views, fearing that the European issue will involve the Far Eastern issue, allowing the X-people to reap the benefits of the fisherman. The X-people probably also have the mentality of taking advantage of changes in the European situation to seek a chance of survival. Therefore, they are intensifying anti-British and anti-Soviet propaganda on the one hand, and conducting relatively large-scale military activities in Hubei Central, Jiangxi Northern, and Hunan Northern areas on the other hand. At this time, I raise the issue of "The Demise of the X-People" to expose the X-people's false Western façade and to dispel the worries of domestic pessimists. I think it is not without meaning to do so. I want to divide this topic into three sections. First, I will talk about the inevitability of the X-people's path to demise. Second, I will talk about how the X-people's demise has already begun. Finally, I will predict how the X-people will perform on their path to demise.

Two

Where does the inevitability of the X-people's demise lie? I can say that it lies in their lack of firm strategy and policy. From a strategic point of view, the X-people's initial strategy around the Lugouqiao Incident was to win without fighting. During the Battle of Songhu, their strategy was a quick battle and a quick victory. During the attempt to occupy Wuhan, their strategy was a quick battle and a quick peace. After seizing Wuhan, their strategy was a long-term war. From a political point of view, the X-people's initial policy was to divide China internally, as expressed in the January 16th Declaration. The next policy was to divide the major related countries in East Asia, as expressed in the December 22nd Declaration, that is, the so-called East Asian New Order proposal. Recently, the X-people's actions in sending telegrams congratulating Germany on annexing Czechoslovakia, occupying Hainan Island, and conducting widespread anti-British propaganda clearly show that they have adopted a policy of dividing the world, that is, not hesitating to join the world political vortex, making the Sino-Japanese War more internationalized, and willingly sharing the fate of Germany and Italy. Here, we must pay attention to the significance of these changes in the X-people's strategies and policies. First of all, we can see that these political and military strategies, the previous and the latter, are contradictory in nature. For example, the strategy of quick battle and quick victory and the strategy of long-term war are fundamentally incompatible. The X-people have made such contradictory changes in political and military strategies in just twenty months. What does this prove? First, it proves that the X-people have always been in a passive position in strategy and policy. Second, it proves that the X-people's strategies and policies have repeatedly failed. Third, it proves that the X-people's strategies and policies are gradually moving towards a path that is unfavorable to the X-people and favorable to us. For example, long-term war and the further internationalization of the Sino-Japanese War are both things that the X-people have always avoided and that China has always hoped for. The fact that the X-people have now adopted such strategies and policies is an example. As the ancients said, "Plan before you act, then things will succeed." There is also a most valuable saying, "A divided mind loses everything." Clearly, the X-people are not planning, and are acting rashly. Since their minds are unsettled, they will inevitably lose this war, this gambling-style international adventure, completely. Therefore, the inevitability of the X-people's demise lies in the fact that they lack firm strategy and policy. In short, if we believe in science and in the past experiences of mankind, then the inevitable arrival of the X-people's demise is beyond doubt.

Three

Now we want to see if the X-people's demise has already begun. My answer to this question is affirmative. I dare to assert with full confidence that the X-people have now begun to embark on their path to demise. How can we see that the X-people have now begun to embark on their path to demise? What evidence is there? This must be what everyone wants to ask. My answer to this question is that there is evidence, clear evidence. This clear evidence lies in the recent embarrassment of the X-people. If we remember the news reports of the past two weeks, and at the same time remember the various statements made by the X-people's Hiranuma Cabinet since its inauguration regarding current policies, we will not find it difficult to discover various contradictions between them, and it will not be difficult to discover the X-people's embarrassment and wavering from these contradictions. First, in the past two days, there have been news of the Hiranuma Cabinet's resignation and reorganization. No matter to what extent these news can be verified in the future, in short, since it came from the X-people's side, it must not be completely without basis. However, in the past two months, wasn't the X-people's media unanimously singing praises that only the Hiranuma Cabinet could inherit Konoe's legacy and complete the so-called "East Asian New Order"? Why is it suddenly being reorganized again? Is it that they no longer want "long-term war" and the "East Asian New Order"? Or is it that they no longer want Hiranuma personally? Judging from Hiranuma's personal social reputation and talent, it should not be that Hiranuma personally has a problem, but rather that "long-term war" and the "East Asian New Order" have undergone some changes. If there are any changes, before finding other reasons, it should of course be interpreted as because "long-term war" and the "East Asian New Order" contain many internal and international contradictions, so they are rapidly being changed to adapt to the internal and external environment. Second, in the past two weeks, in addition to continuing to carry out brutal, threatening, and useless bombings in our northern and southern cities, the X-people have suddenly launched considerable large-scale fierce offensives on the Hubei Central, Hunan Northern, and Jiangxi Northern lines. This is also clearly contrary to the principle of long-term war declared by the X-people. Have we not repeatedly heard the X-chief Itagaki claim that they will take a defensive posture in the front and an offensive posture in the rear by way of annihilation warfare? Now, the X-people's so-called rear annihilation warfare has not actually achieved any success, but suddenly they are making considerable large-scale mobilizations on the front lines. This shows that their so-called "fear of war" has also wavered due to the occurrence of internal and external contradictions and changes in the environment. Third, the recent X-people sent a special telegram to congratulate Germany on annexing Czechoslovakia.

### Anglo-Polish Joint Declaration Formally Announced by Chamberlain Military Alliance Reportedly Concluded Loan Issues Still to be Negotiated

[Haitong News Agency, London, 6th] According to sources close to the Polish Foreign Minister, Chamberlain will issue an Anglo-Polish joint declaration in the House of Commons this afternoon. The original text was finalized yesterday afternoon. The declaration states that the Anglo-Polish Mutual Assistance Alliance is based on the principles of the French-Polish alliance and slightly modified. The Polish Foreign Minister attended a banquet at the Polish Embassy last night, and held a long conversation with British Foreign Secretary Halifax. Those present included the head of the Eastern Department of the British Foreign Office, Strang, and the Polish Ambassador to the UK. It is reported that the conversation covered two points: (1) Poland agreed to the declaration to be issued by Chamberlain today; (2) drafting the procedures for the final discussion of the issues. Although British officials stated that these issues are mostly technical, the Polish side said that the talks were mainly based on economic and financial issues. It is reported that the British loan to Poland and the issue of Polish and Polish Jewish immigration to Britain have not yet been resolved.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 6th] Polish Foreign Minister Beck, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, and Foreign Secretary Halifax continued to hold talks in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon for an hour. In the evening, Beck hosted a grand banquet at the Polish Embassy to entertain the British Prime Minister. Regarding the content of the talks, political circles remain silent. However, according to well-informed sources, Chamberlain may report the progress of the British-Polish negotiations in the House of Commons today, and then adjourn the session for the Easter holiday. Also, the Romanian Ambassador to London, Tilea, will return from Bucharest this morning. All parties expect that the British-Polish talks will be deliberately delayed in order to have the opportunity to hear the final instructions brought by the Romanian Ambassador from Bucharest. Also, the Liberal Star newspaper published an article last night stating that Beck's attitude in talking with British political figures is to conclude a reciprocal agreement with Britain, and there will be no multilateral military alliance, because Poland, no matter what, cannot cooperate with the Soviet Union.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 6th] This morning, diplomatic and political reporters from various newspapers here said that the UK and Poland have signed a defense alliance treaty. At the same time, it is believed that the UK and Romania will sign the same treaty, and Poland has agreed to add more conditions to the Baltic military agreement to suit the current situation.

[Associated Press, London, 5th] Discussions on the British-Polish military mutual assistance agreement have now reached the final stage. The US ambassador also met with the Polish Foreign Minister to learn about the content of the agreement.

[London, 6th] The British-Polish negotiations continued yesterday afternoon. British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Polish Foreign Minister Beck held talks for ninety minutes and have achieved considerable results. Chamberlain will make a statement in the House of Commons this morning. The Polish Foreign Minister and British authorities may hold another short meeting. Today, Colonel Beck will inspect the British fleet in Portsmouth. His visit to London will end tomorrow. [Reuters, London, also dated the 6th] According to the Polish side, the UK and Poland have reached an agreement in principle on the issue of resolving the Jewish problem. The practical measures based on this agreement will also be determined later. It is said that Colonel Beck still insists on maintaining a defense alliance in Eastern Europe, but is unwilling to include Soviet Russia in it.

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 6th] The semi-official press here criticized Tuesday's British-Polish negotiations, saying that they will produce concrete results. "Polish Express" noted the bilateral nature of the negotiations. "Kraj Newspaper" hinted at the possible results of the negotiations, and paid special attention to two points: (1) the independence of Polish foreign policy must be maintained; (2) Poland's relations with its neighbors must be based on the principle of complete equality. The Polish military newspaper believes that Colonel Beck's inspection of the British naval base in Portsmouth is extremely important.

[Haitong News Agency, Amsterdam, 6th] Yesterday afternoon, rumors here circulated that Polish Foreign Minister Beck promised in the British-Polish talks to return Danzig to Germany and allow Germany to build a highway through the Polish Corridor.

### British Financial Circles Believe European Peace Difficult to Maintain for Long

[Reuters, London, 6th] The views of Baysen, which can be representative of financial circles, are that the European situation will reach its peak within twelve months. Although the cooperation and increased strength among democratic countries to achieve collective security is a welcome phenomenon, it is not enough to cause resentment from totalitarian countries. It is difficult for the current German government to continue to seize power and maintain peace in a period of fear. Also, Germany's current financial policy adopts strict suppression methods to prevent currency inflation.

### Tokyo Snows in April First Time in Eight Years

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 6th] It snowed here today, the first time it has snowed in April since 1931. The cherry blossom season was approaching a month ago, but it snowed, which is rare. The climate is extremely cold now. According to the Central Meteorological Observatory, it will warm up soon.

Yugoslavia Pays Attention to Aggression

[Associated Press, Yugoslav Capital, 6th] The Yugoslav cabinet held an emergency cabinet meeting at 11:20 PM last night to discuss the encroachment on Yugoslavia that would be caused by Italian troops occupying Albania.

[Yugoslav Capital, dated 6th] Foreign news, according to a United Press correspondent here, obtained information from reliable sources that the Yugoslav government has received intelligence that Italian troops will occupy Albania at midnight today (approximately 7:00 AM on the 6th in Hong Kong time). The Yugoslav government has neither denied nor confirmed this report. They stated that even if this happens, Yugoslavia will not be surprised.

[Reuters, London, 5th] Under-Secretary of State Butler replied to Conservative MP Marton in the House of Commons today, saying that there has been no progress so far regarding the opening of shipping on the Yangtze River, but we are determined to continue to urge the Japanese side to restore shipping.

Butler then replied to a question regarding the commercial impact of Japan's implementation of the "New Currency System." We are still waiting for the Japanese government's response. As for the suggestion by Sir Leechman that goods from North China should not be allowed to be transported to the UK and its territories unless they have a consular visa funded by British, American, and French banks, Butler replied in writing, stating that the government is currently considering this issue together with issues such as protecting British interests in China, but there is no firm decision yet. He then replied to Stuton that Foreign Secretary Halifax is waiting for a new report from the ambassador to China regarding the Japanese occupation of British cotton mills in Shanghai. He then replied to Racham that the government hopes that the agreement reached between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese side may improve the situation of so-called "terrorism."

### Italy Asks Mexico to Exchange Fuel British and American Oil Companies Oppose Confiscation of Property

[Reuters, Mexico City, 6th] The Mexican government recently received a notice from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, requesting to exchange 1,000 tons of Italian rayon for 1.5 million barrels of fuel oil from Mexico.

[Reuters, Mexico City, 5th] Seventeen British and American oil companies have recently re-initiated legal steps to oppose the confiscation of property and demand opposition to the Mexican President's order of March 18. They will appeal to the Supreme Court.

### Romanian Foreign Minister to Visit Western Europe Mid-Month

On the way back, he will pass through Rome. However, the details of this trip have not yet been determined.

### Stimson Advocates Sanctions Against Aggression Expand Roosevelt's Powers Secretary of War Firmly Demands Military Expansion

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] Stimson attended a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tonight and said that he believes that the United States should join the international front. He advocated that Congress should authorize President Roosevelt to distinguish between aggressors and those who have been aggressed against. Senator Borah asked how to draft a law to distinguish aggressors. Stimson replied that breaking treaties related to the United States can be used as a standard.

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] Former Secretary of State Stimson proposed to amend the Neutrality Act to give President Roosevelt greater unlimited power. Stimson made this statement when presenting his views to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying, "Two of the world's seven great powers have refused to comply with the spirit of mutual respect established between nations." The three countries Stimson referred to were Germany, Italy, and Japan. He also said that if a major war breaks out in Europe, the current neutrality law is enough to make the United States "the second victim to be attacked." "The threat of aggression and the breaking of treaties are parallel and linked actions of these countries. The cautious invasion of Manchuria, North China, South China, Abyssinia, Spain, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Lithuania are all destroyers of past treaties and international law. From this, we can see how serious the situation we are facing is." Stimson's foresight is of great benefit to the executive authorities. However, the current opinion of the government is that the current procedures of the Senate are still a kind of research. In view of the changes in Europe, which are changing rapidly, it is likely that no matter what action the current parliament takes, the actions of the totalitarian countries will often cause the parliament's decisions to lose their impact on American public opinion. The executive authorities hope that Pittman's proposal will be passed, but they still do not consider this to be the final decision, because the government's view of the European situation is that Pittman's proposal is too restrictive to the national interests.

[Associated Press, New York, 5th] US Secretary of War Woodring delivered a speech today, urging industry to assist the government in expanding the military, rapidly building the world's leading navy, and strong land and air forces to cope with any contingency. He said that all private industries must follow the military expansion plan. Also, Rear Admiral Woodward stated that the navy is rapidly strengthening, but it will not reach the authorized military expansion limit until 1945 or 1946, because the construction of large warships takes a long time.

[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] The Senate subcommittee on appropriations unanimously passed a $100 million emergency relief bill. The House allocated $25,000 for the Works Progress Administration.

### Argentine and Mexican Ambassadors to Japan Scheduled to Present Credentials Tomorrow

### Haiphong Held Fishery Zone Auction, Japan Also Participated

### Italian Volunteers, Ciano Denies, Continue in Spain

[Associated Press, Rome, 5th] Foreign Minister Ciano, when meeting with the British Ambassador on Thursday, denied that Italian volunteers continued in Spain. However, senior Nazi officials in Berlin claimed that Germany is currently pressuring Spain to join the Anti-Comintern Pact to resist Britain's encirclement plan. They also stated that at a time when international winds and clouds are tight, Italy cannot possibly withdraw its troops from Spain.

[Haitong News Agency, Puygos, 6th] The fleet recently released by the French authorities held a memorial service yesterday afternoon in the Mediterranean Sea in conjunction with the local Spanish navy to commemorate the personnel who died on the Spanish cruiser *Baleares*, which sank in the Mediterranean. After the meeting, the fleet sailed towards Algiers and Faro.

[Central News Agency, London, 6th] The British Under-Secretary stated in the House of Commons yesterday that German and Italian troops in Spain have not yet withdrawn, but Italy had previously made a guarantee of troop withdrawal. Now that the war has ended, the British side is closely watching the situation.

### British Admiralty Prepares to Deal with Accidents, Speech Causes Unease, Secretary Expresses Regret

[Reuters, London, 5th] Today, the British Prime Minister reported in the House of Commons on the Secretary of the Navy, Earl Stanhope's, anti-aircraft gun speech and the ban on its publication. He said that the Secretary of the Navy's speech was unprepared and that reports claiming that he had asked the press to publish it in a particularly prominent position were inaccurate. He also said that when the Secretary of the Navy gave the speech, he reported that the members of Parliament had not all arrived because some personnel were still on board the ship, guarding the gun positions as in a normal drill during tense times. The Secretary of the Navy only instructed that this drill should not be relaxed, even at this time, and there were no other orders. Chamberlain said that he had instructed the press not to publish the Secretary of the Navy's report because it would inevitably cause alarm. Although this action to reduce unnecessary anxiety among the public was not successful, it showed that the Admiralty was always prepared to prevent accidents. After Chamberlain made this report, he was greeted with applause from the audience. Subsequently, Labour Party member Greenwood questioned, "Does the Prime Minister think that the current Secretary of the Navy is a suitable person to hold this important position? Can the Prime Minister guarantee that responsible government officials will not make such imprudent, irresponsible, and unprepared statements in the future?" Chamberlain replied, "The Secretary of the Navy has expressed regret that his choice of words or lack of appropriateness has caused so much criticism and unnecessary alarm. I do not believe this matter will affect the Secretary of the Navy's abilities." Subsequently, Chamberlain replied to a question from Sinclair, a Liberal Party opposition member, stating that he believed that the government should always ask the press to pay attention to the publication of news, and fortunately, the press often complies with the government's requests, but this incident was debatable because it did not produce the effect he had hoped for. Labour Party opposition member Alexander further questioned whether the Secretary of the Navy's words were the most unwise. Chamberlain said that Mr. Alexander's words seemed to create further problems. The Speaker then stated that this matter did not need to be discussed further. The Secretary of the Navy returned to the House of Commons to explain, "What I said was nothing more than a solemn statement that the Admiralty is prepared to deal with all accidents. I did not expect it to cause the Prime Minister to waste his breath and cause others to pay attention. I am truly full of regret for this."

### Iraqi King's Death, British Prime Minister Regrets, Also Mourns Dead British Consul, Iraq Promises Compensation

[Reuters, London, 5th] At a meeting of the House of Commons tonight, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, on the matter of the British Consul in Mosul, Iraq, Mr. Monck-Mason, being tragically shot and killed by a crowd demonstrating in that country due to the death of the King, especially represented the central government in expressing deep condolences to the entire House. He also represented the entire House in expressing extreme regret over the death of the Iraqi King and stated that there was absolutely no basis to the claim that any troublemakers linked the death of the Iraqi King to the British government. The Iraqi Prime Minister has notified the Chargé d'Affaires of the British Embassy in that country, stating that the Iraqi Parliament will pass a bill to publicly express condolences for the death of the British Consul, and will give him a public funeral in accordance with all rituals, provide compensation to his family, and compensate the British government for all property losses.

[Reuters, Baghdad, 5th] Local officials have recently announced the results of the investigation into the death of King Ghazi, stating, "The car accident was purely accidental and there is no suspicion of any criminal activity. Therefore, this incident has been concluded."

### French President Lebrun Re-elected

### Japanese Administrative Problems, Military Demands Resolution, Affecting Cabinet Status

[Reuters, Tokyo Communication] Several Japanese military leaders are currently considering several political actions to demand that the Hiranuma Cabinet take urgently needed practical steps so that several domestic administrative problems can be resolved. These steps include the establishment of an independent Ministry of Commerce, the fundamental reorganization of the Cabinet Planning Board, and an investigation into the prices of military supplies and war materials. The Army plans to organize an investigation committee to investigate the activities of the Japanese military's rear areas. The matters to be examined by the committee are as follows: (1) The laxity in the work of rescuing the families of soldiers on the front lines, (2) The re-employment and livelihoods of discharged and wounded soldiers, (3) Investigation of whether the awarding of posthumous pensions to the families of dead and wounded soldiers is delayed, (4) The equipment and condition of military hospitals. *The Nichinichi Shimbun* states that since the establishment of the current Cabinet, the Army has not paid attention to political affairs. Now that the Army has turned its attention to politics, it will inevitably have a considerable impact on the future status of the Hiranuma Cabinet.

### Japanese Industry, Abnormal Development, Railway Demand Increases Accordingly

[Reuters, Tokyo Communication] Japan's national railways, with a total length of approximately 25,000 miles and 220,000 employees, earned 725,000,000 Japanese yen (i.e., £42,620,000) in the fiscal year from the beginning of April last year to the end of February this year, including 410,000,000 yen (i.e., £24,10,000) from passenger transport and 315,000,000 yen (i.e., £18,520,000) from freight transport. This profit increased by 15.5% compared to the previous year. The reason given by Japan is that the current Japanese military operations in China have produced an abnormal development of industry, and the demand for railways has also increased. It is estimated that a total of 1,336,665,000 passengers rode trains last year, and a total of 95,800,000 kilometer-tons of goods were transported.

Short Commentary

### Making a Fortune from National Crisis!

Today, our newspaper's Hong Kong news page published a message about a certain member of the ×× Committee falsely claiming to be the ×××× Committee making a fortune from the national crisis. We already consider the bandits who drive away fools to seize money as thieves of human society and want to subject them to public opinion and legal sanctions. Now, this ××× actually takes advantage of the committee's trust from the authorities and the strong patriotism of overseas Chinese for the motherland's crisis and brazenly engages in the shameless act of collecting money to enrich himself. This matter causes the general public who have been deceived to suffer heavy losses and also seriously undermines the credibility of our authorities and future patriotic movements such as raising money for charity. Can its crime be concluded with just the word "swindler"?

We are, of course, extremely disgusted with this crazy, selfish, and deceitful bandit ×××, and we hope that all sectors of society will give it a strong and practical blow. At the same time, we must know that in this unreasonable organization, these bandits who specialize in making a fortune from the national crisis are everywhere around us, and we don't know how many have been deceived! In addition to using the power of the masses at any time to awaken vigilance in all parties and give them blows, we must not think that "this matter is difficult to do" and shrink back from the cause of helping the motherland in distress and rescuing refugees and disaster-stricken children! As long as we remove all empty name worship and emotional relationships, and for all donations, we must seek solid bank guarantees and public reports of expenditure, and its use does not violate the original intention of our donations, then our duty is fulfilled, and the bandits have no way to use their tricks.

### Return to the Motherland's Embrace! Siamese Commerce is Sluggish, Unemployed Overseas Chinese Return Home One After Another, More Than 2,000 Overseas Chinese Returned in March, Tens of Thousands of Poor Overseas Chinese Still in Siam Doing Dance Work

Overseas Chinese residing in Siam have a long history and are numerous, occupying an important position in local industry and commerce. Now, due to the impact of the domestic war, people from Fujian and Guangdong are going to Siam one after another. In the past few months, thousands of overseas Chinese have been traveling to Siam via Hong Kong by ship every month. However, according to people in the Hong Kong Siam Office, Siam has been gradually becoming sluggish in the past six months due to various reasons in the current situation, which has affected local industry and commerce. In addition, the number of overseas Chinese entering Siam has greatly increased, resulting in the increasing number of unemployed overseas Chinese in Siam. Especially among the working class, even seeking two meals a day is difficult. According to reports from the same industry in Siam, there are currently as many as tens of thousands of unemployed overseas Chinese in Siam. Because they are unemployed in Siam, they have no means of living and are in extremely miserable conditions. Moreover, the local government is strictly cracking down on unemployed vagrants in order to maintain social order and public security, and they are often deported. Therefore, unemployed overseas Chinese in Siam really have no way to gain a foothold and are forced to leave Siam and return to their home country one after another. Even those without travel expenses are appealing to local overseas Chinese groups and charitable organizations for assistance. It is estimated that more than 2,500 overseas Chinese returned to their home country voluntarily or were sent back in the past month, and it is still unknown how many are preparing to leave Siam and return to their home country. Therefore, fellow countrymen in the interior, unless they have adequate preparations and can find work and shelter immediately after arriving in Siam, should not go there lightly to avoid all kinds of suffering. It is currently extremely difficult to find a job in Siam. Also, the Hong Kong newspapers reported a few days ago that the Siamese government had revised the immigration law and added new regulations, stipulating that if indigenous children born in Siam want to return to their home country to study or reside in other places, they must obtain a license in advance when they leave the country and collect an export head tax, collecting 4 baht per child. However, the reporter yesterday met with overseas Chinese who had just returned from Siam and claimed that this was purely a misunderstanding and rumor. When the person left Siam, the Siamese Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Finance officially stated that the Siamese government had absolutely no intention of adding this new regulation on the export tax for indigenous Chinese children and that its promulgation was unfounded.

### Germany, Italy, and Japan Purchase Large Quantities of Rice from Siam, Hong Kong Rice Industry Greatly Affected, A Total of 1.5 Million Dan Were Purchased Last Month, Orders for Siamese Rice Are Still Being Placed, Prices Are Rising

Hong Kong's rice business has always relied on Siamese and Burmese rice as its backbone. The rice stones purchased and transported back to Hong Kong have been used to supply the needs of Hong Kong residents and then returned to various counties in the interior to supply the needs of the general public. Since the outbreak of the war in South China, the import of foreign rice has been greatly hindered due to traffic congestion, resulting in a rice shortage in Chaozhou, Shantou, Zhongshun, and the Wuyi counties, and the situation has become increasingly serious. However, the number of Burmese and Siamese rice stones transported from Hong Kong is also limited. However, the general overseas Chinese groups and rice merchants are preparing to order a large number of rice stones from Burma and Siam and transport them back to the interior, which can relieve the rice shortage in the interior and take the opportunity to develop their businesses. Unexpectedly, at this time, according to news from Hong Kong rice merchants yesterday, Germany, Italy, and Japan are purchasing large quantities of rice from Siam and transporting them back to Europe and Japan. It is estimated that Germany purchased three batches of rice stones in Siam in the past month (March), totaling 750,000 dan, while Italy purchased 250,000 dan, Japan purchased 150,000 dan to transport back to Taiwan, about 200,000 dan to transport to Central and North China, and about 100,000 dan to transport back to Japan. According to statistics, the three countries purchased a total of more than 1.5 million dan of rice stones in Siam, and orders are still being placed. Every week, three ships from the three countries will arrive in Siam to transport rice stones. It is expected that there will be even larger quantities ordered. At the same time, Siamese rice merchants are taking the opportunity to raise prices, and Siamese rice prices have been rising steadily. The recent market price has risen by about 15% compared to the previous two or three months. If Germany, Italy, and Japan continue to purchase rice, then the rise in Siamese rice prices is inevitable, which will have a major impact on Hong Kong's rice business and indirectly affect the supply of food in the interior. However, it is reported that the United States in South China and Cuba will levy import taxes on Siamese rice, so that Siamese rice merchants dare not hoard excessively, otherwise the price of Siamese rice will not be so weak. At the same time, the outbreak of the war in Xinhui has made it difficult to transport foreign rice into the Wuyi counties. Therefore, Hong Kong rice merchants are still taking a wait-and-see attitude and dare not purchase from Burma and Siam in large quantities, preferring to let their business stagnate rather than suffer other major losses.

### Details of the Tea Fragrance Room Blood Case Re-examined, Li Bingchun Denies Murdering Japanese, Blood Case Occurred in January, Victim Died in March, At That Time the Deceased Unreasonably Humiliated and Beaten the Defendant

The Tea Fragrance Room blood case on Zixuan Carp Poem Road was examined for the third time by Judge Edwards at the Central Magistracy yesterday afternoon at 2:30 pm. The defendant, Li Bingchun, was charged with murdering Japanese customer Sagara Naomichi in the Tea Fragrance Room at around 11:00 pm on January 28 this year. Government barrister Yu Yi was the chief prosecutor, and the defendant hired lawyer Rama to defend him. After the court opened, the court continued to call Peng Zuhan, the manager of the Tea Fragrance Room, to testify.

Defendant Declared He Voluntarily Went to the Police Station to Surrender

The court then called Situ Luntang to testify, saying that one evening he suddenly heard a woman shouting "Ah!" in the store. He immediately went forward to watch and saw a person in the third cubicle lying on the ground bleeding from the head. He immediately ran out into the street, blew the whistle to call the police. He did not know whether the defendant was in the store that day because he did not have time to pay attention. The defendant later stood at the door and said to him, "No need to blow the whistle, someone is coming, I will go to the police station to report myself." The defendant was usually very kind, etc. The court then called Chen Xian, a partner in the oily chicken stall in the store, to testify. Then Hu Shuzhi, a Chinese policeman of the 501st unit, went to court to testify, saying that at 12:05 am one evening, he left the police station and wanted to go home. Between Gloucester Road and Dongning Road, he saw the defendant covered in blood coming towards him. He immediately paid attention to him and went forward to ask him. He replied that he had cut a Japanese person. He then took him back to the police station to report the case. After the testimony was completed, the defendant's lawyer cross-examined him, asking, what was the defendant's direction when you saw him? He replied that he saw him walking towards the No. 2 House. Asked, do you know that a Japanese person exposed a gun at the East Sea Building in Wan Chai last year? He replied, he did not know at the time, and only heard his colleagues mention it afterwards. Then British Detective Kiltsman testified.

Bad News Spread Suddenly, Sister-in-law Accused Her Brother of Dying

Detu, a British officer, testified, saying that when he arrived at the Tea Fragrance Room that evening, he saw the injured person lying in the third cubicle bleeding from the head. The objects on the table were extremely messy. Later, British Detective Kiltsman handed him a knife, and after the ambulance arrived, he sent the injured person to the hospital. After the testimony, the defendant's lawyer again cross-examined him, asking, do you know about the East Sea Building incident last year? He replied, he had heard of it before, but he no longer remembered it, but he could check the case file to clarify its results and handling. Then Chinese policeman Zheng Xiang testified about examining the defendant and searching his body for letters. Then the defendant's brother Runyang went to court to testify, saying that he was now working on machines in Yau Ma Tei, and the defendant was his brother, and he was also named Li Runqing. He worked in the Tea Fragrance Room. At this point, seeing the defendant imprisoned in the prisoner cage, the love of flesh and blood arose spontaneously, and he could not help but shed tears. He continued, on the 28th of the first month, a relative surnamed Huang handed him a letter addressed to Li Bingchun. After receiving it, he handed it over to his brother at about 8:00 pm that evening. Because he had read the contents of the letter, he knew that it was sent by his sister-in-law, asking him to send money back to his hometown to raise the children. When the relative surnamed Huang handed the letter to him, he told him that his uncle and brother (who had studied at National Central University) had been killed by the Japanese, and his sister-in-law had been raped by the Japanese. Therefore, when he handed the letter to his brother, he also relayed it to him. After listening, his brother was extremely sad and angry. He then crossed the sea and went home. The next afternoon, he was told by a friend that his brother had been arrested. His brother was usually very kind and amiable.

The Deceased Committed Violence, Beating the Defendant

Then the police summoned Fu Yuqing to testify about the defendant's confession when he was charged with murder, saying that the deceased was not killed by him. He injured him because he was forced by the Japanese, causing his family to be scattered and his people to die. At the same time, he himself was personally humiliated by him. He really had no courage to kill or injure people, but because of the above reasons, he cut him, but he did not cause him to die. He cut him in January, and the deceased died in March. After such a long time, the newspaper reported that he would also recover. His death was caused by other diseases. After the incident, his mind returned to sobriety, and he was afraid of implicating others, so he went to the police station to surrender. After the testimony was recorded, the court routinely asked the defendant if he had any comments. The defendant voluntarily stood in the prisoner cage to testify, saying that he came out of the opposite room that evening and passed the third cubicle. He looked at the deceased, wanting to serve him. He summoned him and asked him, "Why is the rotten chicken wing not delicious?" He said "Okay". He said it was too little and the taste was not good. He said that wings were valuable, so the quantity was only so much. He said, "Japanese people, you also want to rely on this," and raised his hand and messed up his face. He took two steps back and said to him, "You shouldn't hit me". He also said "I'm not afraid to hit you bastards". At the same time, he also left his seat and wanted to beat him again. He also retreated until he was near the first cubicle, between him and the chicken stall. The deceased had grabbed his head. He was in an extremely dangerous position. He saw a knife on the chicken stall, so he reached out to take it. He also wanted to grab the knife, but he grabbed it first, so he waved the knife and cut him. After the testimony was completed, the court routinely warned him and ordered the case to be sent for identification.

### In Order to Reduce Costs, Hong Kong Manufacturers Will Set Up Their Own Generators, If the Power Company Does Not Express Its Opinion, It Will Be Implemented, British Electrical Appliance Merchants Have Contacted Various Factories to Install Them

In recent years, Hong Kong's industry has developed considerably, with a total of 200 large and small factories. Because it is connected to the motherland, transportation is convenient, and overseas Chinese in various commercial countries are patriotic, the market is wider than before the war. Therefore, although there are many factories, business is still okay. However, recently, the transportation between here and the interior has been much worse than before, and the raw materials and various costs of goods in Shanghai are lower than those in this port. Therefore, the sales of products are quite threatening. Yesterday, manufacturers in Kowloon considered that the electricity bill alone cost an enormous amount each month. Three years ago, they once requested the power company to reduce the price, but it was not allowed. Recently, various factories are in extreme expenses, and the power company has still not expressed its opinion. A letter was sent to request that a special method be formulated to alleviate the burden of the factories. If the company does not have a satisfactory response, it will install its own generators. After this news was released, a large British electrical appliance factory sent a letter to all factories in Hong Kong yesterday, promising to install generators at low prices and opening up various preferential measures. Some manufacturers are preparing to carry out this equipment. If major factories follow this plan, the China Light and Power Company in Kowloon will be affected.

### Hong Kong News Roundup

…Hong Kong Director of Public Works Han Demiao has retired to England. He left Hong Kong on the responsibility ship at 3:00 pm yesterday afternoon. Han has been in Hong Kong for more than 20 years and has many Chinese and Western friends. Therefore, there were quite a few relatives and friends who went to see him off yesterday.

…Mr. Wu Gonghu's exhibition will be held at the Jinling Restaurant at 2:00 pm today.

The cheap and high-quality products have won the trust of the society.

### The Xin Tai En Opens Four Counties Business Association: Today's Meeting Discusses Saving the Homeland Movement; Devastating Disaster Situation in Various Counties After Japanese Invasion of Jiangmen; Central Relief Committee Allocates 20,000 Yuan Yesterday for Emergency Relief

The XinHui, Taishan, Enping, and Kaiping Business Association of Hong Kong has noted that the Japanese invasion of Jiangmen has caused the war zone to spread across several counties, leading to a devastating disaster situation. The chairman of the association recently visited Xu Shiying, the acting chairman of the Central Relief Committee, to request funds for disaster relief. Mr. Xu immediately agreed to allocate 20,000 yuan in national currency to be jointly administered by the Four Counties Business Association. Yesterday, the Four Counties General Chamber of Commerce and Industry scheduled a meeting for 3:30 PM today to discuss and decide on relief measures. Discussion items include purchasing rice and medicine and dispatching personnel back to the hometown for emergency relief. It has been verified that the Central Relief Committee donation check was received yesterday and can be withdrawn from the bank for use today. Furthermore, it is reported that the 200,000 metric tons of tax-free foreign rice for Jiangmen have not yet been transported and imported. As a result, the high price of rice in the Four Counties has not only not been alleviated but has become increasingly serious. Currently, in various parts of the Four Counties, except for Enping, each yuan (in fractional currency) can only purchase about five or six catties of rice. Many poor people have already run out of food. The most urgent task for current relief efforts should be to sell rice at low prices or provide rice relief. According to an investigation by certain parties, there are still small waterways between Macau and the Four Counties that can be accessed, making import possible, although it is more difficult.

### Reasons for Cold Snap in Hong Kong: Siberian Cold Air Moving South; Spreads Across Europe and Asia; Heavy Snowfall in Shaanxi and Yunnan

Since the 2nd, Hong Kong has experienced a sharp drop in temperature after strong winds and rain, resembling severe winter. The thermometer has shrunk to just over 50 degrees, setting an unprecedented record for the lowest temperature in Hong Kong in April. According to astronomical observations, this is due to the influence of the Siberian cold air blowing south. Yesterday, the temperature in Hong Kong eased slightly due to sunshine, but according to a certain astronomer's prediction, the cold air has not yet blown away from Hong Kong. Because an anticyclone is now covering all of China, the severity of the situation is unprecedented since 1912. At the same time, the atmospheric pressure in Siberia is very low. This cold air affected the entire Eastern Hemisphere. Tokyo, Japan, also experienced heavy snowfall on Monday morning. On Monday, the temperature in Tokyo was seven degrees below zero. North China was also extremely cold. Heavy snow also fell on the Han River and the ground in Xi'an. On Wednesday, Kunming experienced hail. Europe was also affected, with snowfall in Berlin and the temperature in London dropping to 30 degrees. The north of Scotland was completely buried in snow. It can be seen that this anticyclone has affected both Europe and Asia, reaching as far as the British Isles, and the situation is still severe, unlikely to disappear in the next two days. However, this is just a prediction, as the weather changes rapidly and often unexpectedly. It has been verified that the temperature in Hong Kong has been 15 degrees lower than normal since Sunday. The lowest record for April in 1905 was 51.8 degrees, which has been broken twice in recent days. The lowest record the day before yesterday was 50.4 degrees, the lowest April record in Hong Kong's history. Yesterday afternoon, it rose back to 66 degrees, eight degrees higher than the previous highest temperature.

### Conspiracy to Provoke: Japanese Invite Filipino Students to Japan for Sightseeing; The Group Arrives in Hong Kong on the 10th from the Philippines; Hong Kong Organizations Prepare to Welcome Them

The Japanese often use the slogan "Asia for Asians" to propagandize to the weak nations of Asia in order to cover up their ambition to invade our country. Recently, they have instigated Filipino students to organize a sightseeing tour to Japan, providing all expenses and various conveniences. It has been verified that the group, consisting of over 30 male and female members, is scheduled to depart from Manila on the Empress of Canada on the 10th of this month and arrive in Hong Kong. After receiving this news, people in Hong Kong, in order to prevent the group from being exploited to provoke ill feelings between the Chinese and Filipino peoples, plan to unite various organizations in Hong Kong to give them a grand welcome when the group passes through Hong Kong, report the historical facts of China's resistance against Japan, and expose the Japanese invaders' crimes. Currently, the Young Journalists Association has initiated an invitation to organizations such as the Women's Comfort Association, Fujian Fellow-Provincials Association, Literary and Art Association, Student Relief Association, Amateur Friendship Society, International Propaganda Office, Young Men's Christian Association, Young Women's Christian Association, Women's War Relief Association, and Chinese Women's Association to hold a preparatory meeting at the Young Journalists Association at 3:00 PM this afternoon (7th) to discuss welcoming matters and collect various propaganda materials.

### Yesterday Was the National Tomb Sweeping Day; Pining for Ancestral Graves in the Homeland; Extremely Crowded Cemeteries in Hong Kong and Kowloon; Those Who Returned Home to Sweep Tombs in Previous Years Cannot Return

Yesterday was the National Tomb Sweeping Day, commonly known as Qingming. Cemeteries in Hong Kong, such as Caroline Hill, Coffee Garden, Chai Wan Cemetery, Hong Kong Aberdeen Chinese Permanent Cemetery, Jardine's Corner, Ap Lei Chau, and the Ho Man Tin Cemetery in Kowloon, were filled with people sweeping tombs. The quiet cemeteries were filled with incense smoke and firecracker sounds for a time. Trams and buses heading east and west were extremely crowded. It has been verified that before the Qingming Festival, overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, with their respect for ancestors, mostly bought tickets to return to their hometowns to sweep tombs. Therefore, the passenger ships going to and from various rivers were extremely crowded. However, now, due to the large-scale Japanese invasion, many hometowns have been lost, and at the same time, transportation may be blocked, making it difficult to travel. They can only look up at the clouds and pine for their ancestors. While feeling melancholy, they deeply know that only by eliminating the invaders as soon as possible can they restore their ancestral graves.

### Crushing the Traitorous Theory of Submission and Surrender: The Newborn China (Part 1)

— By Qi Zhuo

Ms. Wang Ying's Lecture at the Young Women's Christian Association Yesterday

The motherland is being reborn. The speaker cannot exhaustively describe, nor can the reporter fully record, the countless vivid facts. This newspaper's special article has already introduced Ms. Wang Ying's observations from the front lines twice. However, this is the first time for a systematic and complete transcription of her speech.

Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the Young Women's Christian Association's weekly lecture series specially invited Ms. Wang Ying, the deputy head of the China Salvation Drama Troupe, to speak on "The Newborn China." The crowded audience broke the record for the Young Women's Christian Association's recent lecture meetings. The reporter even heard that some people originally wanted to attend the lecture but hesitated because of the "Women" in the name of the Young Women's Christian Association, thinking there might be gender restrictions.

Is it the appeal of a "modern artist"? No! She is a serious salvation worker who has lived through the hardships of practice. That is the power of her appeal, the reason for everyone's respect. Listen as she strikes at the heart of each individual, word by word:

...After Suffering

"This time, our war of resistance is a national war externally and a revolutionary war internally. On one hand, we are facing death, while on the other, we are growing stronger."

It can also be said that the war of resistance is like performing surgery on a patient's carbuncle. Now, we inevitably have to endure some suffering until the pus and diseased tissue inside the carbuncle are completely removed, the root of the disease is eradicated, and we can live a healthy life.

Now, I want to give examples from my own experience to prove the rebirth of China. These examples are just drops in the bucket compared to the millions upon millions of examples throughout China – of course, this is different from Wang Jingwei's example.

— The audience laughed along with Ms. Wang.

...Military-Civilian Cooperation

The state of military-civilian cooperation could not be better. Military officers and soldiers eat in the thatched huts of ordinary people, and farmers lead their oxen past them. There is no class, no boundaries, no pretense, no fear. This is a miracle that was unimaginable in the past.

When the army marches to the front lines, they often have to walk more than 120 li a day. When they are thirsty, the people immediately boil pot after pot of tea to welcome and comfort them. "Fellow villagers! Soldiers! Drink!" The way the military and civilians are united as one is sure to move anyone to tears!

...Intellectuals Deeply Involved in Inland Work

We so-called intellectuals, in the past, were cultivated by the country, but as a result, we all ran to the cities to enjoy ourselves. In the inland areas, the level of cultural backwardness is simply that of a society from hundreds of years ago. However, have intellectuals taken on their responsible tasks and deeply involved themselves in inland work? Thanks to Japan, this war of resistance has led thousands upon thousands of our young students to deeply involve themselves in inland work. Their clothing and lifestyle are exactly like those of ordinary people as they do physical labor and build roads. If you did not talk to them, you would not be able to distinguish them from ordinary people. In their minds, there is only how to do the work well and how to win the war of resistance. They have no thought for their personal well-being. The work of intellectuals planting seeds in the interior is truly a gift from the Japanese militarists.

...No Rich or Poor, No Friction

For the sake of the war of resistance, there is no distinction between rich and poor, and everyone is of one mind. In the thousand mountains and ten thousand ridges of the Dabie Mountains, there is a wealthy landlord named Gu, who is also a complete feudal local emperor. He has tens of thousands of armed masses, and he is a rich and powerful figure. However, you must know that the wealthy people in the countryside are not like the wealthy people in the city. He has only open fields and gardens, but no savings in the bank. Once the Japanese bomb and occupy the area, he becomes a pauper just like the farmers. Therefore, he deeply realizes who his enemy is. He leads the people to fight guerrilla warfare, fighting very vigorously. They are very familiar with the terrain and often surround the Japanese from the left and right in a sudden attack, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese, causing them great suffering.

The phenomenon of no friction is also very touching. Many salvation organizations work together on the front lines, doing whatever they are assigned to do. They truly cooperate sincerely. In everyone's minds, there is only how to do the work well and how to serve the country. The usual boundaries, shirking responsibilities, and friction have been completely eliminated.

...War Correspondents and War Theater Performers

The spirit of war correspondents is also truly inspiring. Under the bombing of airplanes, they send telegrams and write articles at the same time, and their lives are so difficult. If it weren't for the war of resistance, how could there be such a miracle?

Speaking of our own profession in theater, in fact, many theater groups are like this: when we were in Shanghai before, we would complain about tiredness if we had to perform two shows a day! We had to travel by car and be particular about comfort. But when we get to the front lines, we often have to perform five or six shows a day. Wherever there are soldiers, wherever there are farmers, wherever there are road construction workers, we carry our things ourselves, running dozens of miles and then dozens of miles again to perform for them. On the surface, this is very hard, but in fact, our hearts are extremely happy! We laugh, and the audience laughs with us; we cry, and the audience cries with us. I have been in the theater world for more than ten years, and I have never received the love of the audience. But on the front lines, in the countryside, I have received the love of a wide audience.

### Those Who Profit from National Calamity Deserve Death: A Certain Great Con Artist Escapes with Embezzled Donations; Self-Proclaimed as a Committee Member of a Certain Association, He Has Been Flaunting Himself in Hong Kong for Years; Recently, He Held a Personal Charity Sale and Then Escaped with the Money

Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong have always been very enthusiastic about saving the country and relieving disasters. The results of various charity sales and fundraising activities have been exceptionally good, and the amount of donations received has been considerable. This has led a group of con artists to become covetous, constantly thinking of using clever tricks to deceive overseas Chinese in Hong Kong under various pretexts. The exposure of these "con artists'" evil deeds has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. Recently, there has even been the worst of the "con artists," who has touted himself as a certain committee member of the ×××× Committee and a representative stationed in Hong Kong. For years, he has been swaggering around in Hong Kong, trying his best to recruit prominent overseas Chinese. For a time, he was very high-profile. Moreover, recently, seeing that various charity sales can raise large sums of money, he used his self-proclaimed status to hold a personal charity sale in the Western District of Hong Kong. At the same time, he prepared a large number of printed materials and sent people to distribute them everywhere in advance. Then, he had his cronies carry receipts to collect money everywhere. For a time, his name was left in restaurants, teahouses, hotels, and shops. As for the large number of printed materials needed for this charity sale, they were contracted to ×× Hall and ×× Printing Bureau for lithography and printing. The calligraphy and paintings were exquisite and captured the essence of the originals. The lithography fee alone was no less than a thousand yuan, and the printing fee was more than a hundred yuan. The owners of Qiaochang and the printing bureau, seeing that the guest was extravagant and thought he was a ×× official, did not follow the usual business practice of collecting payment upon delivery. At the same time, many people in the community had heard of his name, but most did not know his background. Now, seeing his enthusiasm for holding a charity sale, many donated generously. Until recently, people in the community, seeing that the results of this charity sale were not weak and that the income should be considerable, wondered why the remittance to the authorities was delayed again and again and were deeply surprised. According to the reporter's investigation, the "con artist" who had been swaggering around has recently disappeared without a trace. ×× Hall and ×× Printing Bureau want to collect printing fees from him but cannot find him. It is said that he has left Hong Kong with the "donations" he obtained. Those who have been deceived include the donors who supported the "charity sale," the ×× Hotel where he stayed for a long time during his stay in Hong Kong, and ×× Hall's lithography bureau and ×× Printing Bureau's printing fees of more than a thousand yuan.

### Jiangmen Hui City and Our Troops Confronting Each Other; Shaping Recaptured, Forming a Large Encirclement; Our Main Forces Adopting an Encirclement Strategy Against the Japanese; Fierce Fighting Results in the Annihilation of Over 300 Japanese Soldiers

[Shiji Quick News] According to official sources, the Japanese forces occupying Jiujiang on the 28th occupied Shaping in the afternoon, attempting to harass He. Our loyal defending troops blocked them in the Zilongkou area, resulting in a stalemate for several days. On the morning of the 4th, after the fall of Huicheng, our army, in order to annihilate the Japanese, recaptured Shaping completely on the afternoon of the 4th, led by a certain unit of our Deng Army, together with local troops, forming a large encirclement against the Japanese in Tangxia Jiangmen Huicheng. The Xijiang battle has turned favorable again.

Forming a Stalemate, Difficult for the Japanese to Advance Further

After the Japanese occupied Shaping, our army moved to the Pinggang and Yugang areas, building strong fortifications, vowing to defend to the death. A certain unit of the Deng Army guarded the Xinqiao Longkou Market area. The Japanese army in Shaping wanted to invade Longkou, but they were repeatedly severely beaten by our army. One day's battle was even more intense. As a result of the fierce fighting, we annihilated more than 300 Japanese soldiers. After this heavy loss, the Japanese did not dare to attack again, forming a stalemate from Gulao to Pinggang.

Five-Pronged Counterattack, Recapturing Shaping

At 6:00 AM on the 4th, our front-line units received orders to prepare for a counterattack. Heshan County Magistrate and the commander of the county's ×th Column personally went to the front lines to take charge of flank command and sent elite troops to flank out to the west of Gulao, exercising armed threat. After all routes were prepared, our artillery fiercely bombarded the Japanese positions. Our soldiers, with the assistance of the National Army, were emboldened and charged at the Japanese positions. From 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, bayonet warfare occurred on all fronts. The Japanese army suffered more than 500 casualties. Without reinforcements, they retreated step by step. Our army took advantage of the victory and pursued, completely recapturing Shaping at 4:00 PM. The Japanese fled across the river in panic, retreating to Jiujiang. Our and Japanese forces have now returned to a state of confronting each other across the river. General Deng Longguang telegraphed the Fourth War Zone Headquarters to report the victory, praising the bravery of all units in combat, and requested commendation for the courageous troops.

Generals Deng and Wang Inspect the Front Lines

After the successive falls of Jiangmen and Xinhui, the main force of our army and a certain unit of the Gui Army rushed to ×× and other places to form an arc-shaped line of defense, adopting an encirclement strategy against the Japanese. The Japanese army, seeing our army gathered, was unable to advance further and has been building defensive works in recent days, hoping to hold firm. On the morning of the 5th, Generals Deng Longguang and Wang Dequan inspected the positions on the front lines of ×× and summoned Gu Dinghua and the generals on all fronts to give instructions.

### The Battle of the Pearl River Delta Unfolds; Our Troops Launch a Large-Scale Counterattack in the North; Most of the 12th Army Group Arrives at the Front; The Japanese Forces in Shengang and Taipingchang Are Showing Signs of Wavering

[Shaoguan Special Dispatch] Military sources report that the battle of the Pearl River Delta has unfolded. Since the Japanese captured Rongqi, Wuzhou, and Doumen, due to the vastness of the battle lines, the Japanese transferred part of the Ozaki Regiment, which defended the northern front of the Beijiang, and the Suzuki Unit of Xiding to Jiangmen for combat. The Japanese forces in the north suddenly showed signs of wavering. At the same time, the remaining divisions of our 12th Army Group have also been gradually transferred from various lines to join the northern front operations. After being reorganized and equipped, they launched a large-scale counterattack. A certain division of the vanguard has now arrived at the front-line positions north of Shengang No. 3. Once the follow-up troops arrive at their designated locations, a general offensive can be launched. It has been verified that the Japanese forces in Conghua have been repeatedly transferred, and their troop strength has weakened. They are now only stubbornly resisting with defensive works, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them.

### Japanese Warships Are Stirring; Three Japanese Warships Discovered off Guantoujiao; Firing at the Shore Without Major Action

[Beihai Quick News] Although the Japanese invasion of Guangdong has the capture of the central region as its greatest objective, they still harass our coastal valleys from time to time, using the frequent appearance of their fleets to disrupt our attention and contain our coastal troops. Since the Japanese aircraft bombed Qinzhou, Beihai, and Fangcheng on the 28th and 29th of last month, they sent the navy to harass the Beihai border on the 30th. Three Japanese warships were suddenly discovered off Guantou Ridge on the 30th, patrolling back and forth. Our defense forces immediately paid close attention. However, the Japanese warships, apart from occasionally firing a few shots towards the shore, did not take any violent action. Our defense forces, thinking it would be a waste of ammunition, did not return fire. On the same day, a Japanese plane flew around Beihai once and left, suggesting that its actions were exploratory.

### After the Japanese Invasion of Hainan Island, the Situation in Haikou Is Extremely Desolate; Our Guerrillas Are Extremely Active; Japanese Military Corpses Are Transported in an Endless Stream

[Guangzhouwan Quick News] After the Japanese army occupied Hainan Island, the local area was in chaos. Refugees fleeing to the Leizhou Peninsula and Guangzhouwan are still arriving in an endless stream. Yesterday, another fifty or sixty refugees came to this port. According to the refugees, there are about three or four Japanese warships currently seen in Haikou, with more than ten motorboats and speedboats constantly patrolling back and forth. As for the Haikou market, although the Japanese army is forcing shops to resume business, business is bleak. The war is still ongoing in Wenchang, Ding'an, Qiongdong, and other counties. Due to transportation blockages and strict Japanese military precautions, detailed information is not very clear, but Japanese military corpses are transported to Haikou for cremation in large trucks in an endless stream. The trucks are covered with black cloth, driving away with no dust to be seen, and the situation is very secretive. Cremation is only carried out at night. It is estimated that the total number of Japanese casualties in this battle is more than 4,000, and the Japanese Chief of Staff Yamada Takayoshi was also killed by our army's tanks in Ding'an County, suffering heavy losses. Currently, our guerrillas are active everywhere, and their momentum is growing, making it impossible for the Japanese to cope. Furthermore, in order to win over the hearts of the people of Hainan Island, the Japanese have specially gathered shameless traitors in Haikou to publish a fake "Xun Bao" (Rapid Report), doing their best to praise the Japanese and fabricate our people's will, distorting the facts, and promoting their poisonous propaganda to fool our people. Fortunately, the villagers in various places all understand the great cause and rarely read this fake report.

### Japanese Warships Have Espionage Intentions; ChaoShan Evacuates the Elderly and Weak; Coastal Garrison Forces Are Closely Guarded; Japanese Warships Patrol Nanao and Haifeng

[Shantou Quick News] The situation in ChaoShan is fluctuating. Since the mid-district war, the area has been quite calm. However, on the 3rd of this month, several Japanese warships were suddenly discovered anchored behind the mountains of Nanao. At around 11:00 AM on the same day, they used machine guns to strafe our fishing boats in Nanao Port and sent speedboats to chase them. As for whether the fishing boats suffered any losses and how much, it is not yet known. Afterwards, the Japanese warships sailed to Beihai and launched small boats to capture fishing boats. As a result, two were captured. In Haifeng, Japanese warships are also frequently discovered patrolling, occasionally firing cold shots towards our shores. Hua Zhenzhong, the commander of the Shantou and Chaozhou Garrison, believes that although the Japanese have not taken any large-scale actions in recent days, it is difficult to guarantee that it is not a prelude to an attempted invasion. Although the ChaoShan defenses have been prepared in peacetime, it is even more appropriate to strengthen them to prevent any eventuality. Therefore, starting from the 3rd, he immediately ordered the troops and local forces under his command to cooperate quickly and strictly guard according to coastal strongholds, and no negligence is allowed. He also ordered all county and city armed local forces throughout the territory to be fully prepared for war and to listen to orders at any time. Furthermore, considering that the populations of Chao'an and Shantou are relatively dense, if a war breaks out and Japanese aircraft indiscriminately bomb, the losses will be heavy, he has specifically ordered the military and police in each county and city to persuade women, children, the elderly, and the weak to evacuate, designating Meixian and Yuning counties as evacuation sites.

### Eastern Front Battle Report: Wu Qihui's Troops Launch Astonishing Counteroffensive; Zengcheng [Japanese troops] Flee Southward; Dongguan [Japanese troops] Also Suffer a Rout; Our Planes Bomb Shilong; Japanese Camp Suffers Heavy Losses

[Huiyang Quick News] The Eastern Front counteroffensive is approaching, following the recent inspection by Wu Qihui, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Army Group and Commander of the Eastern Front, who instructed his troops on strategic matters. On the 29th and 30th of last month, our [forces] had initial contact. The Huang Division of the Twelfth Army launched an offensive against [Japanese troops] in areas north of Zengcheng, such as Zhengguo and Paitan, killing hundreds of [Japanese troops] and seizing countless supplies. This marked an unprecedented major victory in the initial battles of the Eastern Front. It is now reported that certain armies under Wu Qihui's command are continuing to move eastward from Longchuan through Heyuan and Zijin to join the front lines. Their military strength has become more formidable, and their formation is more magnificent. They are determined to strike the stubborn [Japanese troops] and have great confidence. The counteroffensive military operations are continuing, and soon there will be even more astonishing actions. Further reports from the Eastern Front army in recent days are noted below:

Zengcheng [Japanese troops] Flee Southward; Tenacious Defense of Deep Trenches

Zengcheng is an important stronghold on the eastern periphery of [Japanese-occupied territory], with about a thousand [Japanese] troops. Recently, fearing the advance of our main forces, they have been building extremely strong fortifications along the west bank of the Zeng River, including areas such as Jiancai, Ruanwuzhai, and Xiachang, with three or four layers of barbed wire. Their forward guard units are stationed in the areas of Zhunian Ridge, Lizhi Ao, and Hulong Kan on the border of Zengcheng and Boluo near Luofu Mountain. Fearing attacks and raids by our troops and guerrillas, they have been shelling the Hulu Peak, Gutou, and Daxiaolou areas to prevent our counteroffensive. The remnants of [Japanese troops] entrenched in various villages north of Zengcheng, fearing encirclement by our advancing forces, have been retreating in disorder in recent days. Now, [Japanese troops] are stationed in Gaocheng, Guanbu, Yuantou, and Taizikeng in Zhengguo. A small number of [Japanese] infantry and cavalry have been routed toward Fuhe in Zengcheng.

Dongguan [Japanese troops] Harass; Severely Defeated by Our Forces

In the Dongguan area, the Suzuki unit of [Japanese troops] stationed in Guancheng and Taiping has been sending small units to harass nearby villages in recent days, pressuring village maintenance committees to prohibit our hidden guerrillas, otherwise [they] would threaten [atrocities], and constantly dispatching spies and buying traitors to infiltrate our military positions to probe for information. Their intention is to stubbornly defend their strongholds. On the first day of this month, at dawn, over 300 [Japanese] soldiers from Guancheng invaded Liaobu and Dalang along the Guanzhang Road. They were intercepted at Dayangwan and Fupu by the security brigade [number omitted] commanded by Wu Kangjian, which was guarding the Zhangmutou section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line. A fierce battle ensued. We employed mobile tactics to encircle the [Japanese troops] and unleashed a fierce battle with concentrated firepower. After several hours of fierce fighting, the [Japanese troops] were unable to withstand the assault and were routed. In this battle, we killed several [Japanese] soldiers and seized many military supplies. Now, the remnants of the [Japanese troops], having suffered losses, are trapped in the city and dare not venture out.

Shilong's [Japanese troops] Forcibly Enlist Recruits

Furthermore, after the [Japanese] soldiers launched a fierce attack on Xinhe recently, the [Japanese troops] in Dongguan, Shilong, Zengcheng, and Conghua have been frequently mobilizing and making a show of force. However, according to recent intelligence from military agencies, the [Japanese troops] along the entire Eastern Front have not increased significantly, totaling only about one brigade. Their actual strength is quite weak. Recently, they have been on high alert. According to visitors from Shilong, the [Japanese troops] stationed in Shilong have recently felt a shortage of troops and have been extensively drafting strong young residents from the town and nearby villages into the army for their service. All those aged sixteen to fifty are subject to conscription. However, our people are naturally committed to righteousness and unwilling to serve as tools for the enemy or to be cannon fodder for the [Japanese]. They are fleeing to other places in droves. Furthermore, on the 29th of last month, our air squadron flew over Shilong and bombed the [Japanese] military barracks and warehouses, causing heavy losses to the [Japanese] army. As a result, the [Japanese] soldiers in Shilong have been extremely panicked in recent days. As soon as they hear that our air force is approaching, they flee in disarray, which is both pitiful and laughable.

### [Japanese] Sense Weakness in South China's Military Strength; Rumor Has It That Two Divisions Will Enter Guangdong; Will Be Dispatched from Taiwan; Existing [Japanese] Troops in Guangdong Number 100,000

[External Report from Shamian] News from the Southern Expeditionary Army Headquarters of the [Japanese] army states that two divisions will be dispatched from Taiwan to join the operations on the various fronts in South China. This is the third time that the [Japanese] army has reinforced Guangdong, bringing the total troop strength to approximately 140,000. Apart from those transferred back to Japan or to other fronts in Central and Northern China, which are not reported and cannot be tallied, it is estimated that there are still 100,000 [Japanese] troops remaining in Guangdong. The military strength is considered weak.

### Foshan Yingsha: Our Guerrillas Charge In; Intent on Capturing Major and Minor Traitors and Puppets; [Japanese] Troops Panic and Fight; Over Twenty Killed

(Correspondent from Nanhai) The [Japanese] invasion of Xinzeng and Heshan met with our strong resistance, resulting in heavy casualties. They continuously transferred [Japanese] troops from Foshan City and surrounding villages such as Xiajiao and Shiwan to reinforce them. Therefore, the number of [Japanese] troops stationed in Foshan recently is very small, and the defenses are weak. In the city, in addition to approximately three to four hundred members of self-defense groups organized by puppet organizations and the puppet Nanhai police force and [Japanese] military police, there are very few regular troops. Therefore, our guerrillas, who are hidden in the surrounding villages, took the opportunity to launch an even more large-scale operation than before. On the first day of this month, at 2 AM, two to three hundred guerrillas crossed the Wenchangsha River to Yingsha and advanced toward Gangwalang and Shengping Road. The [Japanese] military police discovered them and hurriedly ordered over a hundred puppet police to intercept them. Our guerrillas also did not show weakness. One unit engaged in a fierce battle with the [Japanese] military police and puppet police across the river at the Zhongshan Bridge and Shayi, while another unit charged into Gangwalang in Yingsha. After about an hour, they leisurely retreated along their original route. The Yingsha area has always been a place of extravagance in Foshan, and the romantic atmosphere of the Fen River rivals that of the Qinhuai River. After the [Japanese] invaders arrived, the entertainers scattered, and only a few remained. Therefore, the ranks of traitors and puppets flocked there. The guerrillas' charge into that area that night was actually intended to capture traitors. When the battle broke out, order was greatly disrupted. Traitors and prostitutes were panicked and fled in disarray, some wearing only underclothing. The situation was chaotic. It was confirmed that over twenty [Japanese] soldiers and puppet police were killed in this battle, and three [Japanese] pseudo-military prostitutes were wounded. Five suspected traitors were also captured. Five or six of our loyal and brave guerrillas also died in action.

### Guangdong Provincial Government Issues Order to Protect Landing Airmen

[Shaoguan Quick News] The Guangdong Provincial Government of the Fourth War Area, in order to effectively protect our combat airmen and preserve the integrity of downed [Japanese] aircraft, yesterday specifically ordered the county governments to instruct the district and township offices to clearly inform the people that in the future, whenever an aircraft lands, regardless of whether it is ours or [the enemy's], it must be carefully identified. If it is a [Japanese] aircraft, under no circumstances should the [Japanese] airmen be harmed. They must be immediately turned over to the county government for interrogation. The wreckage of [Japanese] aircraft or scattered parts and firearms must not be arbitrarily collected or concealed. They must be properly preserved and handed over to the township office to be submitted to the county government. If it is our aircraft, officials must carefully protect it and do their best to assist in everything.

### Shipping Special

The Nellore, an iron-hulled steamship represented by the Jardine Matheson & Co., arrived in Hong Kong yesterday morning from Hanzhou via Luzon. Due to the fierce winds and waves encountered along the way, the internal machinery of the ship was slightly damaged. Therefore, after unloading the cargo yesterday, the ship was moved to the Sham Shui Po Shipyard for repairs at 4:00 PM and will resume its journey to Japan on the 10th of this month.

The Shipping Bureau received a telegram from the Taikoo steamer Hunan yesterday, stating that when the ship was sailing at 22 degrees 16 minutes north latitude and 114 degrees 33 minutes east longitude yesterday, it discovered a wrecked boat drifting on the sea surface. After receiving the report, the Shipping Bureau specially instructed all ship captains to pay attention to navigation when passing through the above-mentioned location.

The [Japanese] ship Tangshan Maru arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Taiwan via Xiamen and docked at the Osaka Shosen Kaisha wharf in the Central District. It then departed for Guangzhou at 3:30 PM. It is reported that the ship carried many [Japanese] expatriates and [Japanese] goods when it set sail from Taiwan and will proceed to Guangdong Province.

The China Navigation Company’s Cfngalese Prfnce, which departed from New York via San Francisco and Shanghai on the fifth of last month, was originally scheduled to arrive on the 3rd of this month. However, due to the severe winds and waves encountered along the way, it was delayed until yesterday, when it departed from Shanghai for Hong Kong. It is expected to arrive around noon tomorrow and will be berthed at buoy number A-17 off Stonecutters Island for loading and unloading operations.

Film and Theatre

### Following "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," the Second Animated Feature Film Will Be Scored by Stokowski

World-renowned musician Leopold Stokowski, who successfully made a guest appearance in Diana Durbin's "One Hundred Men and a Girl," will score all the music for Walt Disney's second full-length animated feature film after "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." This joyful news is not only a source of great comfort to movie fans, but it is also a very pleasant matter for the great artist himself, as it is his first venture into this field.

Stokowski is the conductor of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra and was once rumored to be romantically involved with the great star Greta Garbo.

In Disney's new work, Stokowski will not only perform the famous piece "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" but will also include seven classical pieces. Its perfect accomplishment is expected to surpass that of "Snow White."

### Italian Star Isa Miranda

Since Hollywood recently raised the anti-fascist banner, Paramount's new Italian star Isa Miranda has been treated unfairly. As a result, the leading male stars of the studio refuse to mention her name, and the critical community also gives her a cold shoulder. No matter how popular this Italian actress's works are overseas, and no matter how hard Paramount's publicists try to promote her, Hollywood's media will not lavish praise on her unless she makes a real contribution.

However, Paramount is vigorously promoting her, calling her the second Marlene Dietrich. The article will not discuss her "passion" for now and will let the facts prove it. What is to be introduced now is her own history.

"My father was a public car driver in Milan," Miranda said softly in English. She has an unusual learning ability. She learned German in two months to shoot a Viennese film, "Diary of a Lost Woman," and then learned French in ten months to shoot the French film "The Life of Nina Petona."

"I dropped out of school at the age of eleven to work. I started as a tailor. The only work I learned was picking up needles that fell on the floor and handing them to the tailor. The daily wage was only one lira—about five US cents. I often joked that I wished I could be the one dropping the needles."

Isa no longer picks up needles. Instead, she switched to a suitcase factory and then to a handbag factory. It wasn't until she was thirteen years old that she was discovered by artists and sculptors in Milan, who used her as a model.

"This work was much easier than picking up needles or working in a suitcase factory," Isa said with a smile. "My salary was enough to cover the cost of studying typing, shorthand, and bookkeeping at night school. I learned typing and excelled in school, being able to type a hundred words per minute. I was quite satisfied. If I don't succeed here in Hollywood, I will never be impoverished. I can go to work in an office." After finishing night school, she worked as a typist in an oil factory, earning a monthly salary of four hundred lira (twenty dollars). Although the salary was small, it was much better than when she was picking up needles. She worked very diligently and was well-liked by her boss.

"This job was originally [fulfilling], but I soon quit and went to work in a bookstore, earning a monthly salary of one thousand five hundred lira (seventy-five dollars). Before long, the bookstore was closed, and I was unemployed again."

Isa suddenly developed an interest in drama and went to study at a drama school. After graduating, she signed a performance contract with the Filodrammatici Theatre. That was in February 1933. She made her debut on stage, playing the lead role in a play.

"My father died not long after I went to sea, so I was again responsible for supporting my family. My salary on stage was not enough to support the family, and I was constantly in debt. So I thought of making movies. I went to Rome twelve times before finally getting a role as an extra. Later, I finally starred in a film called 'Darkness.' Because I decided that I didn't have the talent for the silver screen, I returned to Milan after filming and worked in a courthouse."

Isa was probably well-versed in her work in the Milan courthouse, so she was noticed by an American women's magazine and was chosen as the champion. Her acclaimed film "Everybody's Wife" became popular throughout the country and was widely discussed. Isa was called Italy's most progressive star. Following this, she made eight more films, all of which were successful. As a result, she was recruited to Hollywood and signed a contract with Paramount.

But Isa does not want to continue her work in Hollywood with an emphasis on sensuality. She does not want to be a sex symbol on the silver screen. If those male and female [stars] continue to compare her to Marlene Dietrich, she can only politely decline.

"I am now known in Hollywood as Isa Miranda and do not want to take credit from others."

She does not want to become reclusive like Garbo but hopes to work hard as a person.

### Cecil B. DeMille Does Not Forget Old Friends

Recently, an incident proved that Cecil B. DeMille is a man who does not forget old friends. When he began filming "Union Pacific," he heard a rumor that an old friend and colleague of his from many years ago was now very down on his luck. This person was George Melford, who was originally a very famous director during the silent film era and had directed Rudolph Valentino's "The Sheik." Now he had long since faded into obscurity. In "Union Pacific," someone discovered him in the ranks of the extras and told DeMille. Upon hearing this, he immediately found Melford and signed a contract with him to play a small role in the film, paying him a very generous salary.

### Second Round of the Xu He Cup Competition: Army to Play South China; Selection of Only Second Team Players on the Forward Line is Baffling

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The Xu He Cup Football Charity Tournament is participated in by South China, the Army, and the Navy, forming a triangular competition. The first match of this year's tournament was held in October of last year, with the Navy playing the Army. At that time, warships were gathered in the waters of Hong Kong, and there were many excellent football players, who formed a team to compete with the Army. The competition was fierce. As a result, the Army's record of not having been defeated by the Navy for several years was broken. The second match is scheduled to be held on April 10th (Monday of Easter holiday), with South China playing the Army, at the Navy Ground.

This competition adopts a single round-robin system of ninety minutes each. The team with the highest score after playing all three games will win the championship. The matches will be held at a third-party venue. As the Navy won the first match, if South China can defeat the Army in the second match, they will have two points, the same as the Navy. The third match between the Navy and South China will be like a final, with the winner taking the championship. If South China loses to the Army in the second match, the discussion will be different. The match results are recorded as follows:

Team Name Win Draw Loss Score

Navy Team 1 0 0 2

Army Team 1 0 0 1

South China Club 0 0 0 0

The Army's selection of players for this match against South China is quite surprising. For example, instead of selecting the three outstanding players of the Middlesex Regiment for the forward line, they have chosen to use only second-team players. This move is truly baffling. Or are the new players better skilled? The selected lineup is recorded as follows:

Deng Qin (Scottish), Fraser (Scottish), Shi Han (American), Mei Shi (Artillery), Su Shi (Engineering), Liddi Shi (Supply), Daffilu (Supply), Shu Shi (American), Ge Lu (Artillery), Ge Ni (American), Yan Bachhen (Supply)

Mo Chengshi (Engineering), Bobbix, Jashi, Falandashi (Artillery), Weijianchen, McDonald (Scottish), Ling Shi (Supply)

### Public Lawn Tennis Tournament: Da Linzhen and Li Huitang Win; Doubles Match Between Li He and Peter Not Completed Yesterday

Two singles matches were held in the Hong Kong Open Lawn Tennis Tournament yesterday. One was between Da Linzhen and Tan Lianchen. Da Linzhen's close-range attacks and long-range shots were exceptionally accurate, leaving Tan struggling to defend. Da Linzhen won the first set 6-3. Afterwards, Tan fought bravely, meeting the attacks from the left and right, and gained some ground, but ultimately could not defeat Da Linzhen's defense, so Da Linzhen won the second set 6-4. The other match was between Li Huitang and Qing Jinman. Li's reception and interceptions left Chen unable to save the situation. Li won the first two sets 6-3 and 6-2. The doubles match between Li Rurong and He Jialiu against Peter and Defu was fiercely contested. Li and He launched attacks simultaneously, while Peter and Defu showed no weakness, meeting the attacks from the left and right. The scores rose and fell, making it quite tense. It was not until Li and Lin launched a surprise attack that they won the first set 15-13. However, Li and He's stamina was not as good, and they failed to defend, with their interceptions and drop shots failing. Peter and Defu took the opportunity to kill the attack and won the second set 6-0. The deciding set was tied at 5-5 when it became dark. The referee announced that the match would be rescheduled to determine the winner. The results of yesterday's matches are as follows:

Singles

Da Linzhen defeated Tan Yunchen 6-3, 6-4

Li Huitang defeated Chen Jinman 6-3, 6-2

Doubles

Li Rurong and He Jialiu against Peter and Defu 15-13, 0-6, 5-5

### Wing Yip Brand Final: Wellington Team Wins Championship; Kitchee Unfortunate to Lose

In the Wing Yip Brand Small Football Final, Kitchee played Wellington. The two teams had fought fiercely several times, eliminating strong teams and reaching the final. They met yesterday, each with their own ambitions. The fans were extremely crowded. For the sake of prudence, a changed referee system was adopted. Liu Qingxiang and Costa were fair and insightful. Before the match, the Eastern Life School choir sang a patriotic song. The match was filled with highlights. Although Kitchee's skills were better than Wellington's, they lacked luck. They attacked more than they defended throughout the match, but they were repeatedly thwarted by Zheng Huasheng's skillful saves, who saved more than ten dangerous balls. They also forced more than ten corner kicks. Wellington's players were all outstanding, as were Kitchee's. However, Ye Guoying performed poorly; otherwise, they could have turned defeat into victory. Due to their lack of luck, Kitchee lost 0-1. Thousands of fans regretted it. What was most gratifying was that only tension was seen, with no uncivilized behavior. The lineups of both sides are recorded below:

(Wellington)

Lin Huasheng Deng Songbai Dong Jinpei Zhong Wei Zhang Xin Deng Yingquan Li Huilin

### Veteran Sports Figures Form Sporting Goods Company with Five Admirable Trade Principles

Two veteran figures in Hong Kong's sports community, Mr. Ho Ka-lau and Mr. Yu Wing-tsan, recognizing that the supply of sporting goods in Hong Kong is still not widespread enough, have established the Tat Tung Sporting Goods Company on On Lan Street. The company is already in operation. Yesterday, a reporter interviewed the person in charge of the company, and their trade principles were found to be quite admirable. We record their words below for introduction: (1) Adopting the "Trade-Inservice" racket trade-in system, which is a first for Hong Kong. For example, if someone has an old racket and wants to buy a new one, the company can facilitate the exchange. Even the rackets used by world tennis champion Björkman are eligible for trade-in. (Note: The company was the first to list the aforementioned rackets and is currently the only vendor.) (2) Implementing mechanized stringing of racket strings, also a first for Hong Kong. This eliminates the old method of awls and pliers, replacing it with mechanized stringing, resulting in perfect results. The accuracy and evenness of the tension are far superior to the old method. Not only are the strings undamaged, but it also avoids the defects of racket cracking or bending. Trial use will convince. (3) The design and construction of various sports fields are undertaken by experts. For all types of fields related to football, volleyball, basketball, tennis, softball, and badminton, as well as the laying of turf for tennis courts, inquiries regarding how to proceed will be answered in detail. (4) Experts are responsible for designing private gyms. New-style equipment such as electric horses, electric weight-loss machines, electric massage machines, rowing machines, and other body-building equipment can be ordered on behalf of customers at reasonable prices. (5) The company sells the lightest and most convenient American rowing engines, such as those produced by the Lee factory, and can also arrange for orders. These engines, when equipped with six-volt or ten-volt batteries, can power even skin boats and canoes as desired, adding endless interest for those who enjoy summer sea bathing.

### Guangda Ao School Basketball Team Arrives in Hong Kong Yesterday, Wins First Match Against Qing Zhi

The teacher first prepares several blank sheets of paper, each containing the same communication matter, such as "X number of people killed at the front," "? thousands," or "Acquired ? tanks," etc. Each row should have one sheet. The writing should not be visible. Each row is a unit. The communication matter is given to the first person in each row (from left to right or from right to left). They hold it in their right hand and raise it high. After the teacher gives the order, each person gets the message and whispers it down one by one to the last person, who quickly reports it to the teacher in a soft voice. The person who is fastest and most accurate is the first place and gets one point. After three or five rounds of competition, the person with the most points is the first place and receives an award. The value of this game lies in cultivating students' agile and quick minds and the habit of speaking quickly.

### Random Notes from the Flower Market

— Yu Wan

That flowers can form a market is indeed, as the name suggests, the place where flowers are sold, and there are many special places where they are displayed for sale.

Originally, there was more than one place in Hong Kong where one could buy flowers. However, because the agricultural area is especially adjacent to the New Territories, Kowloon City naturally promoted a flower market on Boundary Street in the peninsula.

If the God of Spring is the creator of human happiness, then the "flowers" in spring are the creator's gift of happiness to mankind—every morning, from the smile of the rising sun, we can see many so-called happy people, dressed in the fresh attire of spring, coming out of the various floors of western-style buildings, and going to the "Flower Market". Their bright lipsticks deepen the color of the red Tea roses, and their ice-like skin reflects the budding of the mountain lilies—naturally, the young ones, whether they are husband and wife or lovers, are dragging along, and there are also middle-aged people who have borrowed their wives and children. The elderly, perhaps one or two percent, sometimes stroll there with their canes. T, who studied medicine, told me that I should come here in the morning to breathe fresh air. My reply to him was that it is really difficult for people in big cities to take a breath, and it is even more precious to be able to walk into the flower market and breathe in enough fragrant flower scent. Perhaps these are the so-called happy people.

As spring gradually deepens, the flowers also compete for beauty; there are large quantities of purple peonies in the flower market, as well as blood-like red roses. It is said that the painted sparrow flower is especially durable and fragrant, which is pleasing, so the sale of painted sparrow flowers is also quite numerous; in addition, there are the refined small white chrysanthemums, the full-faced primroses, the petite gladioli, the pure white lilies, the orange golden cups, the blue kingfishers... truly too many to enumerate. "Where the cuckoo cries, blood turns into flowers." The sale of azaleas in the market is also considerable. Around Qingming, our national soul, our ancestors, in this national sacrificial festival of blood and tears, are added with perhaps a sentimental tear of sadness!

The happy couples and lovers all have "flowers" in their hands. If they walk together, they are like participating in a "group wedding". Statistics show that some want to buy a larger bunch for three or two dollars, while others only want two or more dollars, and even a few cents can buy five or seven flowers; as for azaleas, potted flowers require $1.80, and loose flowers are no less than two or three cents. The flower stall faces east perfectly. In the morning, in the dim morning light, flower vendors carrying flower poles and baskets start arranging their rows. People buying flowers come as early as six o'clock, but there are still few people before seven o'clock. The most lively time is from eight to nine o'clock. After nine o'clock, the flowers will be reduced in price, and some even shout about the price reduction.

Every year, from early spring to the thirteenth month of late spring, people are equally happy to visit the flower market. However, perhaps there will be more "flower buyers" this year! Because there are indeed many happy people among the refugees!

In addition to "flowers," flower stalls also have food. This is perhaps because farmers, in addition to growing flowers and birds for a living, also engage in growing glory, yams, melons, and beans. There are also some small merchants who have been abandoned by broken capitalism, who also sell miscellaneous goods and hawk them. It seems that there is a lot of organization here. Those selling melons and vegetables walk to the corner of a road; those selling miscellaneous goods set up shop in the mud piles of the unbuilt road; those selling flowers can be said to be the largest number, and they almost entirely form a scene of selling a "flower world"! Therefore, people who visit the flower market may sometimes buy some vegetables, eggs, and the like. Young masters and young ladies sometimes even sell foreign dolls, paper kites, paper snakes, etc. to bring back.

Those who beg for a morning and evening meal of course do not have such leisure to buy flowers; child laborers in factories cannot afford foreign dolls and paper dragons and paper snakes. People who visit the flower market are perhaps happy people.

### It's About Women Again

— Zhang Chunfeng

Women are always a topic for men, but fairness is lacking, and distorted words are countless.

Liu Yuanqing's "Record of Worthies," Volume 1, has a clause that says:

"Hu Sanzai governed Da Yi, without bringing his wife and children to the post. Someone asked him why, and Hu smiled and said, 'I study the books of sages and worthies, discuss the methods of governing officials and ruling the people, and do not want to damage my reputation! When I embark on my official career, I indulge in the enjoyment of sounds and colors, and many lose their principles. Women and children are especially easily confused. Considering this, I do not want my wife and children to be a burden.'"

Reading this grand theory of officials taking office without bringing their wives seems very reasonable. One sentence, "We study the books of sages and worthies... women and children are especially easily confused..." It's as if reading the books of sages and worthies means one cannot have a wife. Are the books of sages and worthies so powerless that they cannot even manage women? How can one talk about governing officials and ruling the people? This deserves a fierce rebuttal from women.

Generally, the ancient Chinese views on women were no more than two attitudes: either despising and avoiding them, or indulging in and being unable to extricate oneself from them, using them as comfort. Xian Yizhi's "Essays," Volume 4, says:

"The nature of horses is easily frightened, so the character 'fright' (驚) contains the character 'horse' (馬); the nature of women is easily jealous, so the character 'jealousy' (嫉妒) contains the character 'woman' (女)."

This is not only using etymology to explain why women should be despised, but it is even comparing them to horses. Furthermore, Zhen Yichuan's "Anthology," Volume 2, has a clause that says:

"Liang Wang Yi of the Southern Dynasties hated seeing women. He would stand several steps away and detect their odor from afar."

This is despising women to the extreme. It's strange that these people were not born from women's wombs.

This school of thought absolutely does not acknowledge that women should be respected. The so-called "beautiful poisonous snakes," "women are the source of trouble," etc., are all the opinions of these people. They despise women to such an extent.

Among men or literati who discuss women today, there are still many who cannot escape these two schools of thought. It is said that the film "A Gorgeous Beauty," which uses women's madness to sell sex appeal, has actually caused a sensation in Hong Kong and is a great box-office success, which is proof of this. According to the men who came back from watching "A Gorgeous Beauty," it is "sensual! Gorgeous!" Sometimes adding a Cantonese phrase, "mo sap!" As for asking those upright gentlemen why they went to see "A Gorgeous Beauty," they said, "I want to see if there are any lewd shots in 'A Gorgeous Beauty' that are worth criticizing." In the end, women once again became a living topic for men.

In a extravagant world obsessed with money and sex, it should still be women who pave the way for themselves!

### Spring Streets

— Wang Yang

The wind carries a bit of chill as it blows. The spring sunshine is so weak, faintly reflected on the ground. This city is entirely nestled in the arms of idleness. On the roads, people stroll with hands tucked in, their faces cheerfully turned towards the gentle breeze. The road stretches from one corner of the city to the northern suburbs, so long and desolate. The short trees on both sides, only as tall as a person, tremble their leaves, seemingly also afraid of the cold. Occasionally, a car speeds by, swiftly and steadily traversing the road ahead.

As we reach a street corner in the city, the sounds of voices become somewhat clamorous. The cries of vendors and the hurried steps of pedestrians echo from within the city, sharply piercing people's ears.

"Sir, please help us refugees!"

"Sir, we've come all the way from Guangdong as refugees!"

These two voices prompted my companion and me to take notice. We glanced over and saw two children, around ten years old, standing beside us, one boy and one girl. Their clothes were still neat, but rather soiled. Their faces were smeared with snot and ash, patchy and uneven. They wore no shoes, and their feet were covered in a white substance, as if stained by lime or something similar.

"Where are you from?"

My companion and I, caught by an unusual emotion, stopped to ask.

"We're from Nanhai, Guangdong," the boy answered.

"Second Pu," the girl added.

"They're asking about your hometown," the boy corrected her. His demeanor was calm and collected, his eyes shining with a deep light. One could clearly see his sincere desire for compassion.

"Does the government provide relief for you? Three jiao of paper money each day," I said, watching him closely.

"Not anymore, they gave us five jiao once."

"Three jiao of paper money is good enough. We haven't received any. In Guiping, they gave five jiao at a time, and here it was also five jiao once," the girl interjected.

The wind tousled her hair, making it look like a bundle of grass.

"We came all the way along the West River, but we didn't get anything at any of the places we stopped. In Wuzhou, we got two bowls of porridge a day, but nothing else. Later, Wuzhou dispersed us to Rongxu, and Rongxu sent us here."

"Then how did you get your cotton-padded jacket?" I asked.

The boy looked down at his shirt. "We brought it ourselves. When we left, this was the only piece of clothing we had."

Suddenly remembering that there were two children, my companion asked the girl:

"Where are your parents?"

"Father's dead. We don't know if Mom got out. Everything was so rushed that day. The rice was cooked but we hadn't even eaten it when the gunfire started. My brother and I got separated from Mom." She pointed to the boy. "He came out with his father."

"Then where's your brother?"

Turning her head, she pointed to the Second Market protruding into the street, saying, "He lives inside."

The boy told us that they were leaving for Nanning tomorrow. The boat was hired by the government, but they still had to find a way to get food.

"We just want you to help us with tonight's meal. We don't know where we'll get it tonight," the girl said, looking at me.

We both lowered our heads, unsure how to express the great sympathy we felt for these two adorable children.

A moment of silence passed.

At this point, we hadn't noticed that an old man and someone who looked like a porter were standing beside us, likely having heard a good portion of the conversation. This older gentleman spoke up:

"It's really tragic, unable to find their parents, unable to return home, and at such a young age."

The old man wore a hat with a black string knot, his red face reflecting two yellow eyes. From the sweat towel tucked in his collar, we knew he was a commoner coming from the market. After he spoke, tears welled in the corners of his eyes. He looked at me.

"But, uncle, this is all because of the Japanese ×× that we are like this," we said to him.

His pale green eyes flickered, and his wrinkled face drooped.

"It's not Japanese!" the boy exclaimed. The girl echoed his words. However, they had no tears, their eyes wider, staring at us with determination and certainty.

Quickly, they broke the silence, changing the subject to ask me:

"Sir, please help us!" Each word rang out clearly.

We gave them four jiao of paper money, and they each said "Thank you" to us. I remembered years ago encountering beggars at gates or on Yong'an Road who would thrust a tin pot or something similar towards pedestrians, persistently pestering them. But these child refugees were not like that.

The wind was blowing, and the trees by the road swayed from time to time. I walked towards the end of the road. Gradually, as we approached the edge of the city, we faintly saw two small figures shrinking in size, becoming blurred. But spring still overflowed in the brows of every passerby.

### Unforgettable Shaoguan

— Yi Wen

After the fall of Guangzhou, Shaoguan was briefly a chaotic city. However, since General ××× took command in Shaoguan, he quickly stabilized the distraught populace and restored the city's original vitality. Although the city had suffered the ruthless bombing of enemy planes, each bomb only instilled deep hatred in the people, and did not diminish the tranquility of their lives. We can tell the invaders: today, every Chinese person is facing the war. Today, every Chinese city, like Shaoguan, is showing a vibrant atmosphere.

It was the morning of March 1st when the Yuehan train brought us to this important town in northern Guangdong. When we saw the valiant people of Guangdong, when we saw so many political workers returning from the front lines, we felt indescribable joy and a sense of nameless comfort in our hearts. We saw slogans on the bridge, written in the local dialect, urging people to watch patriotic dramas, which shows the success of the local patriotic work. And from this, we can also see how actively the people's movement is being developed. But we want everything in a rear base to be even more active than it is now, and this depends on the efforts of every political worker and local patriotic writer, so that Shaoguan becomes an iron fortress.

Around ten o'clock, we were taken to the secretariat of the Commander's Headquarters of the ×th War Zone in a car belonging to the headquarters. As we rested, we were deeply ashamed of Mr. ×'s hospitality. After lunch, we learned that the commander wanted us to perform a play, and that the stage had been set up a few days ago after the commander received a telegram from Director ×. We couldn't refuse the work before us, even though each of us was eager to complete the journey abroad. Also, we hadn't prepared to perform a drama, but we felt we should take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the commander. So we agreed. We decided to use two short plays that we had performed in the war zone as a gift of gratitude. These gifts were very meager and crude.

After the captain assigned the tasks, some comrades went to set up the stage, some reviewed the two short plays they had decided to perform, and others prepared costumes, props, and simple explanatory leaflets. By the time our work was completed in a very short time, it was already dark.

Under the captain's notification, all comrades dressed up and went to the dinner prepared for us by the commander.

In a room with a lavish banquet, we met Commander ×. He shook hands with each of us. A general who we had admired for a long time was now warming our hearts with his palm!

During the meal, the commander gave us unlimited blessings and encouragement for our upcoming work abroad, as well as many practical instructions. Every word of the commander was a paddle of encouragement, making us grateful, even to the point of tears. Eating such a dinner and receiving such warmth, oh, we cannot express the words in our hearts.

After the meal, the comrades playing the roles in the two short plays began to put on makeup backstage.

At this time, the commander sat in front of the stage, his face glowing with excitement. Many spirited officers and young political workers crowded the makeshift theater.

We began to perform our two short plays:

The first play was: "Since September 18th," a one-act allegorical drama. The entire play symbolized the tragic ending of advocating "peace" and "friendliness." The second play was "Escaping to Shaoguan," which many people were familiar with, a drama where you put down your carrying poles. The two short plays were quickly completed (lasting about two hours). Using these two short plays as a gift of gratitude, we still felt it was meager and crude. However, we sincerely took out our hearts and presented them to the commander and many officers and political workers.

We spent the night in Shaoguan with peace of mind.

The next day was Arbor Day.

We are deeply grateful for the commander's invitation, which allowed us to plant trees in Shaoguan today and leave an eternal Arbor Day memorial. Especially when we are about to leave our own country, planting trees on our own land is such an unforgettable and memorable thing.

At two o'clock, we followed the commander and his officers to the Guangxi slope halfway up the mountain. After a while, the commander came out of his residence and stood in front of us, briefly and concisely explaining the significance of Arbor Day to all the officers. The commander finished speaking in a solemn atmosphere. At this time, the commander called us to the many heroic soldiers in front of us and introduced us to them. Suddenly, the commander issued an order. We received the salutes of all the heroic soldiers, and we returned the salutes. We were so touched!

After the simple Arbor Day ceremony, teams of people walked through the narrow mountain path. On the mountain path, they used hoes to loosen the soil and used iron shovels to scoop up the soil. Teams of people filled the semi-circular mountain path, planting with excitement. The commander also smiled and held a tree, bending over, and planting with the officers and soldiers.

New seeds were planted on the mountain.

We also planted on the mountain, and we commemorated Arbor Day in Shaoguan.

At around four o'clock in the afternoon, the commander's headquarters sent three cars to take us out of this important town in northern Guangdong - Shaoguan.

However, the difficult Shaoguan holds unforgettable memories for us.

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Ge

She ignored him, only looking at the high sky, as if in leisure, untouched by anything around her; like a traveler, luggage packed, only waiting for the train to arrive, this moment of leisure before departure to be carelessly thrown away.

Reality wouldn't allow him to linger in delusion. He was driven to the point of helplessness. He began to pour out his grievances. He said:

"I can let you go!"

"Then I'll leave!"

"But what will I say to my comrades when I return?"

"Just say you couldn't find me!"

"I can't lie!"

"So, you still won't let me go?"

"It's not 'won't,' it's 'can't'!"

"But you shouldn't dream of me going with you!"

This time their conversation was a candid unveiling of their hearts. This near-primal sincerity could break through the barrier between them. However, their opinions occupied extreme ends, never converging on a single point. Therefore, after their conversation ended, it could not continue. They fell silent, gazing at each other.

The snowflakes drifting down had thinned out, and the night sky of the snowy night had cleared somewhat. But the night wind had risen, stirring up the snow on the ground, swirling it into infinitely long cotton threads, lifting them into the sky, or shaking them in all directions. If another gust of wind swept them back, what fell from the sky would be a waterfall of snow, what swept in from afar would be a long river of snow. Manchurian snow is the most peculiar, the source of all wondrous transformations. Manchurian snow will always lure the spirit, is the world's miracle. Manchurian snow is forever the dream of those who appreciate water, the dream of beauty.

The night's severe cold was like barbs piercing flesh and bone, making one feel not cold, but pain—a natural punishment inflicted on humanity.

He had endured this punishment for a long time; one day, he would discover the wound inflicted by this punishment—frostbite. But he was accustomed to this kind of life.

This severe cold seemed reluctant to inflict punishment on this innocent executor, telling him: (29)
