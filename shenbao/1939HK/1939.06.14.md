### Quiet Beihai (Special Dispatch from Beihai)

— Wang Hetian

When we arrived at Hepu City, it was as if we had stepped into an uninhabited wasteland, a dead city after a bombing catastrophe! Bombed streets, broken walls, and even the few complete shops had their doors tightly shut and locked. A terrifying atmosphere enveloped every corner—and the next morning, eight enemy planes came again for a frenzied bombing. However, when we ran to Beihai, thinking that it would be more dangerous in a place under the enemy's guns, the situation turned out to be beyond our expectations. Not only did we not feel terrified, but on the contrary, the tranquility of Beihai was rarely seen in Guangdong cities. The French-style streets were still neat and orderly, and we didn't see a single bombed house. If it weren't for the sparse pedestrians on the streets and the shops half-closed, I would have almost forgotten that this was Beihai under the threat of enemy guns. Why is it that this place, so close to the enemy, is so peaceful? What is the reason? After two days of observation, I deeply felt that Beihai harbored a serious crisis.

I. The Current Situation in Beihai

Beihai is the largest commercial port in the Gulf of Tonkin. Its sea routes connect to Annam in the south and Hong Kong in the east. It is an important town on the southern route and a seaport for Guangxi. France, England, and Germany all have consulates here, which shows the prosperity of its commerce. In the past, it was changed to a city. Now it has been abolished. The entire town has thirteen bao and twenty-nine thousand two hundred and forty-nine people, but due to the threat of enemy planes, many citizens have moved to the countryside. Although foreign merchant ships still frequently come and go to Hong Kong, most of the shops are closed. Some are afraid to purchase goods, selling off remaining stock with their doors half-open, as if waiting for an opportunity. Moreover, some large merchants have deposited their goods in foreign consulates or foreign-run hospitals, observing the situation.

Political Mobilization

In terms of administration, Beihai has had considerable success in training and conscripting young men in the past. Furthermore, the youth here consider serving in the military a glory. Fifty-five strong men volunteered to kill the enemy. Preferential treatment was implemented for the families of soldiers on expeditions. Committees for preferential treatment for the families of soldiers on expeditions were organized, cash condolences were held, and each family was given two yuan per month. Four schools for the children of soldiers on expeditions were established, offering free education. In terms of education, private schools were changed to public schools. In the supervisory district, teachers from various schools organized mobile education teams, implementing compulsory education in densely populated areas. Literacy classes for the masses were established in various schools within the supervisory district, and with the help of comrades from the Anti-Japanese Vanguard, everything was proceeding smoothly in each village. Speaking of mass mobilization work, such as destroying highways and assisting the army in building fortifications, the response was quite enthusiastic. However, the village and bao-jia organization was too unsound, and mass mobilization work was still insufficient.

II. The National Salvation Work in Beihai

In the past, Hepu County was the most enthusiastic and successful area in the national salvation work in Beihai. There were as many as ten drama troupes in the national salvation organizations. However, after the threat from the enemy forced the relocation of the first middle school of Beihai and Hepu, the national salvation work also came to an end. It gradually stagnated, either due to financial difficulties or the harsh environment. Currently, only the Fifth District Anti-Japanese Support Association's wartime service corps and the Women's Anti-Japanese Association are still doing some work. The rest of the groups have ceased operations. Recently, the Women's Anti-Japanese Association launched a "selling flowers to save the nation" campaign, which raised more than two hundred yuan. They used the funds to comfort the border defense troops and present a banner to the border defense troops, encouraging the soldiers defending the territory. In addition, they held first-aid training classes to prepare to participate in frontline rescue work.

Anti-Japanese Sentiment Among Dock Workers

What comforts me the most is that, under such circumstances, the comrades of the defense army's political work team have mobilized hundreds of dock handcart workers to organize and participate in the Anti-Japanese Association. Handcart workers are organized into groups, each with a group leader who regularly calls meetings. On May Day, they implemented the National Anti-Japanese Covenant. Because of their living conditions, they did not understand what an association was. When the Dock Workers' Association was established, they elected officers, but they did not understand what "officers" meant and were not used to calling them that. Therefore, they called the officers of the labor union "the foremen of the foremen." This is truly an interesting term!

In addition, there is also the Barbers' Anti-Japanese Association and the Mass Night School Students' Anti-Japanese Association. Besides publishing a weekly wall newspaper, they have not shown much work performance.

III. The Crisis in Beihai

Although Beihai is a flat coastal area with no defenses to speak of, and the enemy could land at any time, the defense army, under the mission of "defending the country is the duty of soldiers," has already done much in strengthening anti-enemy efforts. The Beihai authorities should organize and arm the entire population to assist the defense army in fighting to defend their homes!

One District, Three Public Offices

However, the highest organs in Beihai are the Fifth District Office, the Police Bureau, and the Beihai Town Public Office, and they are not doing enough in this work. Furthermore, there is a lot of friction among them. Originally, the latter two organs were under the command of the District Office, but the Police Chief thought that he was also appointed by the Department of Civil Affairs and did not consult with the District Office when doing things. The Town Public Office thought it was the local master, with power and influence, and did whatever it wanted. There were even conflicts of interest, with the Police Chief beating the Bao Chief, and police soldiers and the self-defense corps almost fighting each other over women. Recently, the Town Chief accused Li XX, the head of the town's militia, of ten crimes because of smuggling. In short, these kinds of friction are being exacerbated by the instigation of traitors, which is very dangerous.

The Smuggling Problem

Some say that the loss of Guangzhou was due to smuggling in Danshui. Today, Beihai has the same phenomenon. Although there are customs and a small number of anti-smuggling personnel here, the coastline here is long and impossible to defend against. Furthermore, smuggling here is organized and protected by local armed forces. According to investigations, the masterminds behind the smuggling are unscrupulous merchants, and some town and village chiefs are semi-openly smuggling in Dianbai Liao, Baihu Tou, Gaosha Long, Longtan, Daguan Sha, Nankang, and Lemin Po Wei, etc. The Beihai Fifth District Office once detained the village chief of Shangsha Long for smuggling. Because of smuggling, customs revenue has been greatly reduced.

Cheap Goods Flood Villages and Small Towns, such as kerosene, which sells for only six or seven yuan a case in Nankang, but sells for more than twenty yuan in Beihai. The Beihai Town Second Bao Militia confiscated eight barrels of smuggled kerosene, but the Town Chief, in the name of the brigade commander, forced them to hand it over. Later, the Town Chief awarded the Second Bao thirty yuan in prize money, saying that the goods had been returned to the original owner. But what happened to those eight barrels of kerosene? They didn't know. In the evening, I specifically went to the coast to inspect the defense army and the militia on patrol. Unexpectedly, I saw the police also on the beach. Originally, there were no police posts on the beach, but why did they come here? Later, an investigation revealed that they also had other business—in short, smuggling in Beihai is becoming increasingly serious. If no way is found to eliminate it, perhaps Beihai's life will be cut off by the evil hands of smugglers.

The Activity of Traitors

Since the cracking of the case of traitor Mai in Dongxing last year, who confessed that the boss of a gold shop in Beihai was also a traitor, everyone has paid attention to the activities of traitors in Beihai. However, because the environment here is complex (there are consulates of various countries and foreign-run hospitals), and our political institutions are not strict, even the police bureau has stopped registering residents' movements, which gives traitors more opportunities to sabotage the national salvation work. For example, when the Women's Anti-Japanese Association organized reading classes for prostitutes, the traitors immediately sabotaged it, saying that the government wanted to conscript prostitutes into the army, scaring them from daring to come to school. Also, when handcart and dock workers formed an organization, they were threatened by traitors, and they didn't even dare to mention the words "anti-Japanese." Local big merchants are preparing to live as obedient subjects and are storing their goods in foreign consulates, while preparing for the fall of Beihai, and organizing a refugee relief association with foreigners. Furthermore, since the case of Pang Kuanfu, the boss of Heyi Company, smuggling enemy goods—sulfide ore (fifty barrels)—last year, the government has not dealt with him, and the unscrupulous merchants are even more blatantly sabotaging the war of resistance.

The Problem of Fishermen's Relief

Since enemy warships entered the Gulf of Tonkin, the first to be hit were the fishermen, especially after Weizhou Island fell into enemy hands for the second time. No less than one or two thousand fishermen have died at enemy hands. Now they dare not go out to sea to fish, and the lives of fishermen who depend on the sea for a living are becoming more difficult every day. Furthermore, the enemy often uses small favors to lure the fishermen. Learning from the past lessons of Luodian and Haiyan, we have paid attention to the relief of fishermen. However, although it has been proposed at the joint meeting of the party, government, and military in Hepu, there is no conclusion, which is also a serious problem.

In summary, Beihai is harboring a serious crisis. Now we must overcome this crisis and defend Beihai. We must (1) adjust the personnel of party and government organs; (2) strengthen the leadership of Beihai's national salvation work and implement the wartime mass mobilization plan; (3) promote the movement of earning well; (4) thoroughly solve the fishermen's relief problem. Because Beihai is the gateway to the rain road and the outer defensive line for defending Nanning, if these problems are not resolved, the crisis in Beihai cannot be overcome.

### The Flag Selling Campaign and Creating a New Era of Adult Education

— Lei Peihong

Since the "July 7th Incident" broke out, the people of the entire Republic of China have stepped onto the path of not hesitating to make any sacrifices in order to earnestly fulfill the great way. This is the path of national liberation. Although this path is circuitous and full of difficulties and obstacles, there are milestones in the near or distant future that clearly indicate the way, so that travelers will not get lost or lose their way. World history tells us that since the 18th century, the tide of national liberation has been rising, with one wave after another. Only people who are living in a drunken stupor, indifferent to order and chaos, and unconcerned about pain or pleasure, will lose their way and stray into the wrong path leading to a premature death. Only people who abandon themselves and give up on themselves, belittling themselves and willingly accepting failure, will fall behind and ultimately be eliminated by society. If not, if some people can constantly remind and alert themselves to the degree of national liberation, and also struggle together, their future will be bright and far-reaching, and their efforts will not be wasted, but will surely reap great rewards. The culmination of this great harvest is the success of national liberation.

Specifically, this time is a chaotic and deeply painful period that the Chinese nation has never encountered in its history. The handling and resolution of such chaotic and deeply painful period will undoubtedly provoke a fundamental change in future Chinese society. The details of this fundamental change, at present, we will not discuss in detail, and we cannot discuss in advance, but in any case, this change, generally speaking, can be said to be inseparable from its essence. That is to say, our highest ideal is "to seek freedom and equality for China"; and its greatest success is the realization of national freedom, equal civil rights, and the happiness of the people's livelihood, in order to establish a society of the Three People's Principles.

Under such important circumstances, we must establish an adult education system that creates a new era, so that we can control new developments and respond to new requirements. On the term "adult education system," we prefix it with "creating a new era," which is nothing more than to point out a key point, namely: ordinary school education is not enough for the tasks assigned by the new era; and the general public or the current adult education, which emphasizes literacy education, is of course even more insufficient. Education is a process by which an individual joins society, and in order to effectively participate in social life, an individual must have a full understanding of the ideals and goals of that society. In today's society, the largest and most important organizational unit is naturally our country - the Republic of China, and the most common and ordinary social life is none other than the national life of the Chinese nation. As for our social ideals and goals, in addition to the former being mentioned above, and regarding the latter, then during this national liberation movement, it is nothing more than: "Nationalism above all else; the nation above all else; resistance first; victory first; concentration of will; concentration of material resources." These are all living teaching materials, and must be practiced by the people of the whole country in their lives. These are all of fundamental importance in today's society and constitute the main themes of education, and must be done by all members of the nation on a down-to-earth basis. Unfortunately, the current school education focuses on the traditional curriculum, and general adult education, including mass education and social education, is nothing more than an emphasis on the popularization of literacy education. Because of this, even if these types of education can be realistic, they are not enough to inspire the masses, so that they can fully understand society and effectively participate in social life. Therefore, an adult education system that creates a new era must be established. Based on this, education and life can be effectively linked, and the mission of national liberation can be completed.

Based on the above discussion, the importance of the flag selling campaign and its social value can be understood without much explanation. Originally, "the origin of the flag selling campaign, in a nutshell, is extremely ordinary, extremely small," this is what Mr. Wu Hanzhen told us. Following this, he also described the course of the flag selling campaign, and discussed the keys to the success and failure of mass movements. He earnestly pointed out: "Today, those who can mobilize the masses and mobilize the masses are not those who just talk the talk; but those loyal people who usually forget their own interests, truly serve the masses, seek benefits for the masses, and solve problems for the masses." He further painfully declared: "You are for the masses, the masses want you; you are for yourself, the masses leave you." These are all valuable experiences gained by Mr. Wu Hanzhen from the mass movement work. If he allows me to add a word, that is to say: This is the moral lesson that our adult educators have gained from participating in social movements.

Originally, in such a turbulent society, all interactive behaviors and common behaviors are the most difficult to organize. Even if the organization is temporarily successful, it is easy to lose its original organization. If we do not immediately find ways to remedy it, these behaviors will have no way to initiate or continue to develop. Here, first, let's talk about flag selling from the perspective of flag selling, and then talk about the national salvation movement from the perspective of the flag selling movement. I am extremely grateful to the flag selling vendors in Hong Kong. Let me first declare that this is not an emotional statement; on the contrary, it is a conclusion drawn from an objective attitude and an analysis of the facts. Specifically, the Hong Kong flag selling movement initially originated from two fruit vendors in Sham Shui Po, then influenced twelve vendors, and then promoted to the Sham Shui Po district and the Mong Kok district vendors' flag selling. Before there was flag selling, this group of vendors were originally individually operated vendors. From the perspective of common sense, they not only did not communicate with each other, but were also easily aroused by their respective competitions. Under such circumstances, interactive behavior and common behavior were originally extremely difficult to promote. However, for the sake of saving the Republic of China, for the sake of saving our compatriots, one vendor after another, inspired by righteousness and driven by patriotic and people-loving enthusiasm, were able to unite. Thus, flag selling became an interactive behavior, and the flag selling movement became a common behavior. At this moment, we can imagine that this group of vendors will inevitably encounter obstacles from time to time. And from the perspective of the secular eye, they are ignorant and uneducated, and can be called "commoners." However, no matter what dangers there are ahead, they still firmly uphold the central purpose of these interactive behaviors and public behaviors; no matter what difficulties they encounter, they can always overcome these difficulties with a pure, naive, and enthusiastic heart and a courageous and forward-looking spirit. The result is that this group of vendors has become patriots who save the country and the people, and have become benevolent people who love the country and the people. From the perspective of the adult education movement, this is not only a success in the self-education of this group of vendors, but also a new creation of the old experience of social life. Furthermore, from the perspective of the national liberation movement, this is not only a great contribution from the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, but also the supreme glory of the Republic of China.

### The Question of Japan Joining the Anti-Communist Alliance

— Wan Zhongwen

This is an old story from more than forty years ago: When Japan was interfered with by the Triple Intervention and began to advocate for concluding an alliance with Britain, Foreign Minister Mutsu Munemitsu, who had been out of office for a short time, wielded his sharp pen despite his illness and published an article titled "The Wedge of Diplomatic Alliance" in his magazine "Japan of the World," saying that it was too early to talk about an Anglo-Japanese alliance. He said:

"The Anglo-Japanese alliance, its name is very beautiful, and the expectations of the people of the time are also very great. However, Britain is not a Don Quixote who worries about the worries of others and saves people from their urgent needs; Japan wants to obtain security guarantees through the alliance, and Britain must also obtain the same guarantee. If this guarantee cannot be given, then Britain will never become a country in the alliance. I sincerely do not know whether the debater believes that Japan's current national power can provide security guarantees for Britain's infinite defense line? ... At the time of the Liaodong incident, the Ito cabinet looked ahead and behind to wait for Britain's statement, so that Britain made a statement to express the meaning of the alliance, then the Ito cabinet would also be determined to secretly leap forward and try its hand at a quick thing; Britain did not do this, but instead hoped that the Ito cabinet would listen to the proposals of the three countries. Is this not an example of Britain's position in the East? ... Therefore, if Japan's military strength is not much different from today, then the so-called Anglo-Japanese alliance is just a dream, just vanity, just a painted cake." (Published in August of Meiji 28)

In this paper, Mutsu has gently pointed out several requirements for alliance diplomacy: First, equality of interests, second, equality of power, and third, equality of guarantees. These requirements are the only basis for judging whether alliance diplomacy can be established. Taking the past history of European alliance diplomacy as evidence, it is all the same. Talking about whether the enemy country wants to join the German-Italian-Japanese anti-communist military alliance recently, they can also make such observations.

Of course, on the surface, in order to cut off the aid of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union to China, so as to achieve the desired results of its war of aggression against China, Japan has the need to conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy. However, in practical terms, this issue of alliance diplomacy is very subtle and complex, and not as simple as some people imagine.

The first is the issue of interests. Japan's central interest lies in the invasion of China, and the invasion of China has not yet reached the stage of direct conflict with Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union that cannot be resolved without war in the current and near future. Although Japan is also clamoring to advance south and seize all the colonies of Europe and the United States in the Pacific, this is just exaggerated propaganda by young soldiers and emerging politicians. In fact, does Japan need this at the moment? Does it have the ability? Even if it is seized, can it be permanently maintained? All are problems. The financial capitalists and the old and important ministers who ultimately determine Japan's national policy must not rashly regard the exaggerated propaganda of the young soldiers as a program of action. Therefore, Japan's interests are very different from those of Germany and Italy, because for its own interests, Japan can not participate in a large-scale world war with Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, but if it is allied with Germany and Italy, then Japan will inevitably participate in the Second World War for the sake of Germany and Italy's interests in Europe and Africa. The cunning Japanese xx will never do the "heroic" work of Don Quixote, who sacrifices himself and worries about the worries of others and the urgent needs of others.

The second is the issue of power. If Japan joins the German-Italian military alliance, it will inevitably use the power of its entire army, navy, and air force in the future war to confront China, which has been resisting for a long time, to the north to confront the Soviet Union, a large country with a large army, and to the south to confront Britain and the United States, a large country with a large navy. Germany and Italy in distant Europe cannot divide its equal power with equal power. Only Japan supports it alone in the Far East. This is a one-man show that Japan wants to sing but cannot.

The third is the issue of guarantees. Due to the inequality in the combat power of the three countries, their guarantees are also unequal. If Japan joins the German-Italian alliance, then the guarantee that Japan gives to Germany and Italy is heavier than the guarantee that Germany and Italy give to Japan. Even if Japan is very stupid, it is not willing to lift this heavy and tasteless "single stick."

Judging from the above three points, it can be seen that Japan does not seem to be participating in the completely automatic German-Italian military alliance at present. Japan's future diplomacy towards Germany and Italy is more possible and necessary, only the following three items:

The first is to conclude an alliance diplomacy with Germany and Italy that is specifically aimed at the Soviet Union, the content of which is similar to the first Anglo-Japanese alliance, that is: If Japan goes to war with the Soviet Union alone, then Germany and Italy will maintain good-neighborly neutrality; if other countries provide military assistance to the Soviet Union because of the Japanese-Soviet war, then Germany and Italy must provide military assistance to Japan. Its role is to limit the inevitable Japanese-Soviet war in the future and achieve victory, which is also similar to the first Anglo-Japanese alliance.

The second is to use the axis of the original Japanese-German-Italian anti-communist political agreement to launch coordinated diplomacy at an appropriate time, so as to negotiate the Far East issue with Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union and obtain a guarantee for the established results of the invasion of China. Mutsu Munemitsu would say: "Japan can be tolerant of the powers but cannot relax a step towards China." This is Japan's clever traditional diplomatic strategy!

The third is to use the anti-communist axis to wait for changes in the international situation and play a set of diplomatic piracy in the event of a fire. In the Second European War, even if Japan does not participate in the German-Italian war and remains neutral, it can also use this pivotal position to threaten and blackmail Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union.

These three future policies of the enemy country are closely related to our country's war of resistance, and are worthy of our serious vigilance. Although we cannot objectively change the diplomatic policy that the enemy is bound to pursue, we only have to prepare for more bitter sacrifices, make greater determination, firmly and confidently resist the war, eradicate all obvious surrenders to the enemy, and get rid of all opportunistic ideas of waiting for the international situation to end the war. From the independent war of resistance, we will strive for independent diplomacy, so as to deal with the enemy and others who are bravely and unyieldingly to the end, and realize the supreme requirements of the war of resistance and nation-building!

British Government Lodges Strong Protest with Japan [Reuters, London, 13th]
The diplomatic correspondent for the News Chronicle, Mr. Baddaley, declared today: "The British government has instructed its ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to warn the Japanese government that the Anglo-Japanese conflict in Tianjin is dangerous. I believe the impasse caused by the British refusal to hand over four Chinese individuals to the Japanese in the Tianjin concession could be resolved by forming a commission with equal representation from Britain and Japan, chaired by a neutral party. This commission would examine all evidence and make a final decision on whether to hand over the Chinese individuals. If the Japanese refuse this suggestion to resolve the matter, it will inevitably lead to more serious incidents."

U.S. Ambassador Arrives in Guiyang [Central News Agency, Guiyang, 12th]
U.S. Ambassador to China, Mr. Johnson, arrived in Guiyang on the evening of the 12th and will proceed to Chongqing within days.

Japanese Attempt to Develop North China - Japanese Government Approves So-Called Three-Year Plan [Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 13th]
According to a Japanese announcement today, the North China Development Company has been approved by the government to implement a so-called three-year plan, aiming to develop the plains east of the Taihang Mountains in Shanxi Province, and other projects. It is reported that the budget will include the construction of 3,000 kilometers of railways in North China, approximately 600 kilometers of railways in Inner Mongolia, construction of ports in North China covering an area of approximately 2.5 million square meters, and the mining of 7 million tons of coal, 1 million tons of pig iron ore, 1 million tons of lime, 50 million tons of steel, 2 million tons of cotton, and 500,000 tons of wool in Inner Mongolia.

Japanese Army Weariness of War [Fancheng, 13th]
The Japanese army has suffered casualties of 7,343 in recent battles around the Dabie Mountains. The elite Fujie Division has suffered the most significant losses. The commander of its affiliated Yamada Kizang Regiment was killed in action northeast of Zao Yang. This has led to widespread war weariness in the Japanese army, which has gradually manifested in anti-war actions. Even the Japanese authorities cannot deny this and are reportedly considering countermeasures.

Bishop Yu Bin Broadcasts Speech, Calling on Americans to Aid China, Relieve Chinese Refugees, and Assist Economic Construction - Audience Exceeds Ten Million [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th]
New York, May 24th (Airmail): Since the opening of the New York World's Fair, all prominent figures from various countries passing through New York have been invited by the fair to give broadcast speeches. On the evening of May 23rd, at 10:00 PM, the fair invited Bishop Yu Bin to broadcast, reaching an audience of over ten million. Bishop Yu's speech covered three main points: (1) He praised the Pittman Neutrality Act amendments, believing that they would effectively ban the export of military supplies to aggressor nations and expressed gratitude for Pittman's sympathy towards invaded countries and his support for China. (2) He stated that the most urgent task was to relieve Chinese refugees. During the great famine in Tsarist Russia, the United States donated $70 million. Now, China is bravely resisting aggression for national independence and human justice, with 30 million refugees facing unprecedented misery, yet receiving only one million dollars in donations. Given the strong ties between China and the United States, and China's fight for democracy admired by the U.S., he hoped all Americans would rise up to help. (3) Since the start of the war, China has been actively promoting economic development in the northwest and southwest provinces, with boundless potential for future growth. He hoped Americans would actively invest. The original speech was quite lengthy and was widely reported by newspapers the following morning.

A Brief Comment: "Meeting Force with Force for Those Who Like to Use Force"
On the 12th of this month, the British Foreign Secretary declared in the House of Lords: "Britain must meet those who like to use force with force." This statement will undoubtedly resonate with every Briton who truly loves Britain and peace. If this statement can be earnestly implemented, it can thwart the schemes of warmongers and safeguard British interests and the world's peaceful order, whether in Europe or the Far East. However, the question is whether the Foreign Secretary's statement will remain just a statement, and whether it will be undermined by other compromising conditions. For instance, in his speech on the 12th, the Foreign Secretary expressed a stronger stance towards Japan, stating: "The British government will issue a stern protest to Japan regarding the lives and property of British citizens in the Far East, navigation, and the Shanghai International Settlement." But if this is merely to reassure the domestic population without the preparation and the actuality of 'meeting force with force for those who like to use force,' then it will only allow those who like to use force to freely exert their power! Amidst the serious situation in the Tianjin and Shanghai concessions, British and French Far East land, sea, and air forces will hold a meeting in Singapore, and the friendship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is also greatly increasing. May everyone join forces to implement 'meeting force with force for those who like to use force!' If China, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union can truly cooperate, it can be asserted that 'peace can be achieved without bloodshed!'"

The Issue of the Existence of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Library
The question of whether to maintain or abolish the public library run by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce will be discussed at today's general meeting. We have seen restaurants, tea houses, theaters, dance halls, and even "businesses that lead people to depravity" flourish in Hong Kong in recent years, without any forceful condemnation from society. Yet, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Library, which educates the public, enlightens the ignorant, and benefits society, is facing the question of its very existence. We are not only shocked and indignant, and feel it is unjust to the thousands of readers of the library, but also deeply concerned about the cultural level of Hong Kong residents and worried about the future of society! Therefore, for the sake of culture and the future of society, and for the reputation of Hong Kong and its million-plus residents, we sincerely hope that the proposer withdraws the original motion to abolish the library. We also hope that people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, will work together to provide moral and material assistance to develop this only library that benefits those who are hungry for knowledge. We also sincerely hope that social leaders from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, will make further efforts to establish a large-scale library so that Hong Kong can also join the ranks of world-class metropolises in terms of culture!

According to Japanese newspapers in Tianjin, the main points of the economic blockade of the British Concession are as follows: (1) Prohibiting ships from sailing to the British Concession. (2) Inspecting all foreign nationals entering the British Concession and reviewing their passports, but Britons will not be allowed to enter or leave. The French Concession remains calm as usual, and the authorities do not appear to have taken any special measures.

Wang Jingwei Confirmed to Arrive in Tokyo - Two Personnel of the Japanese Consulate in Tokyo Die Due to Purge of Traitors

According to a report from the Far East correspondent of the Berlin Daily News, personnel of the puppet government in the Japanese-occupied areas welcomed Wang Jingwei's recent peace proposals, but the National Government strongly opposed them. The report also stated that if Wang's move fails, he will take pro-Japanese actions and form a puppet government in the Japanese-occupied areas, appointing himself to important positions.

According to reports from Nanjing, two Chinese servants, brothers, from the Japanese consulate have disappeared since the incident. The Japanese side is currently searching for them.

Military Authorities Promulgate Guidelines on Treating Prisoners of War
Resisting Japan is Not Against All Japanese Soldiers - Treating Prisoners of War Emphasizes Leniency [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd]
Our country has always valued peace and universal love. Even in this sacred war of resistance, we have always adhered to the principle of leniency in treating prisoners of war, as we deeply understand that our enemy is the Japanese militarists, not all Japanese soldiers. Now, our military authorities, fearing that the military and civilians across the country may not fully understand this principle, have extracted important articles from various "Regulations on Prisoners of War" and formulated "Guidelines on Treating Prisoners of War" for promulgation. The full text is as follows:

Guidelines on Treating Prisoners of War
(1) All Japanese military officers and soldiers captured on the battlefield who voluntarily disarm and renounce combat are entitled to the treatment of prisoners of war.
(2) Japanese military officers and soldiers captured by us should be immediately handed over to the nearest higher-level command and then transferred to prisoner-of-war camps by the rear service department. They should not be detained in combat areas for long periods.
(3) The period of detention of prisoners of war by command agencies at all levels shall not exceed the provisions of Article 7 of the Measures for the Handling of Wartime Prisoners of War and Spoils of War.
(4) All field detention centers should be located at least 25 kilometers away from the front lines to ensure the safety of prisoners of war.
(5) Prisoners of war should be treated the same as our military and civilians and their dignity and reputation must be respected.
(6) Anyone who injures or kills prisoners of war without cause shall be punished for the crime of injury or murder.
(7) Wounded prisoners of war, regardless of the severity of their injuries, should be properly treated immediately.
(8) When occupying Japanese positions, severely wounded prisoners of war should be rescued and sent back to the rear for treatment and must not be killed.
(9) Except for weapons, horses, military documents, and military equipment, which may be searched and confiscated, all other items carried by prisoners of war shall not be confiscated.
(10) The living conditions of prisoners of war should be treated according to their rank, with equal treatment given to those of the same rank in our country.
(11) The quality and quantity of food for prisoners of war should be the same as that of our soldiers.
(12) Sick and wounded prisoners of war may be given special diets according to their health needs, but this must be done in accordance with the procedures prescribed by doctors.
(13) The clothing and bedding equipment of prisoners of war should be kept clean at all times, with emphasis on hygiene.
(14) Prisoners of war should be allowed a certain amount of exercise to maintain their health.
(15) Prisoners of war should not be interrogated immediately after being captured. Before interrogation, their anxiety, worry, fear, and self-abandonment should be dispelled to create a harmonious atmosphere for them to provide accurate testimony.
(16) Prisoners of war who are uncooperative or attempt to cause trouble may be punished in accordance with the current Army Criminal Law of our country.
(17) When interrogating prisoners of war, a sincere and friendly attitude, as well as careful and tactful patience, should be used to elicit information. If a prisoner of war is unwilling to answer formal questions in detail, it is not necessary to press them for answers.
(18) All documents issued to prisoners of war should be in a language that the prisoner of war understands or should be explained in detail to ensure clarity.
(19) The true name of a prisoner of war may be kept secret if the prisoner of war does not wish to disclose it.
(20) Prisoners of war may be given free postage for mailing letters, etc.
(21) Prisoners of war should not be disturbed by visitors or frequently photographed, as this would harm their self-esteem.
(22) The Party's ideology and history, military situation, international trends, and the situation in Japan should be explained to prisoners of war at any time, or compiled into periodic publications and pamphlets to be provided to prisoners of war for long-term reading to ensure transformation.
(23) Prisoners of war may exchange information with their families or friends or send money and clothing, but the administrator has the right to inspect them.
(24) Prisoners of war who attempt to escape or have escaped and are recaptured, or who have escaped into Japanese territory and are recaptured, shall still enjoy the treatment under these measures.
(25) If any prisoner-of-war administrator fails to handle matters in accordance with these measures, the prisoner of war may file a complaint with the highest military administrative agency.

National Government Orders [Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th]
The National Government issued the following orders on the 13th:
(1) Tang Guangqi, Counselor of the Military Council, is assigned to another post. Tang Guangji is hereby relieved of his current position.
(2) Tang Bohu is appointed as Advisor to the Military Council.
(3) Yan Xiangquan, Colonel of Infantry, and Lu Jijie, Colonel of Cavalry, are promoted to the rank of Major General of the Army. Wang Qingzhong, Lieutenant Colonel of Infantry, is promoted to the rank of Colonel of Infantry in the Army.

The Jerusalem of the War of National Revolution (Part Two) - Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Ye Quesun

Guerrilla Cadre Training Class
The number of students in the training class is over a thousand, including many women. The students are mostly mid-level cadres from the troops, such as battalion and regimental commanders, as well as young students. Many are young men and women who have been engaged in national salvation work or participated in battlefield service during the war of resistance. In short, they are all capable friends selected and recommended from various places. They are divided into several teams, with some teams mixed with female students and others exclusively for male students. The dormitories are divided into multiple locations. The daily work schedule is eleven hours, waking up at five in the morning and going to bed at nine-thirty in the evening. The day includes seven hours of academic subjects, one hour of physical training, two hours of group meetings, one hour of self-study, and half an hour of extracurricular activities. The principles of life are wartime-oriented, guerrilla-oriented, and full of hard work, resilience, and a lively and strong spirit. Because politics is more important than military affairs, spirit is more important than material things, and practical experience is more important than knowledge from books, the instructors in the cadre training class mainly come from three sources: (1) The Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission; (2) Eighth Route Army cadres with guerrilla experience; (3) Central Military Academy instructors with excellent technical skills. There are many talented people, truly gathering heroes from all over the country. Their distant future and magnificent contributions will be evident from this.

General Bai Chongxi, the director of the cadre training class, told reporters: We want to make students deeply understand the meaning of war. This war is different from all other wars, such as the wars of the past, which were merely massacres caused by the desire for the benefit of a few people or the expansion of a certain country. China's war is a revolutionary war, a bitter struggle in which we have had to rise up to resist aggression for the freedom, equality, survival, and independence of the nation. Because it is a revolutionary war, it includes comprehensive tactics in politics, economics, culture, military affairs, and education. Our methods of fighting are different from those of other countries. Others must have a rear, but we not only do not distinguish between front and rear, but also send people to the enemy's rear to turn the enemy's rear into our front line. Others' wars require everything to be prepared before they can start fighting, but we do not need to constantly calculate the comparison of military strength. We must grow in war and develop in the midst of artillery fire. Therefore, the purpose of our founding of the cadre training class is to cultivate a new batch of cadres, expand guerrilla warfare, and coordinate and realize comprehensive warfare. Mr. Bai smiled and was full of spirit. Finally, he said: "I have just returned from inspecting various provinces, including Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian, and have lectured in various places on the importance of guerrilla warfare in the second stage and how to strengthen guerrilla forces." The reporter silently assessed that this man was truly a talented person.

The work of the graduates of the cadre training class will be nothing more than: (1) Returning to their old homes ravaged and slaughtered by the Japanese to destroy the Japanese; (2) Cooperating with the army to do various political work; (3) Uniting exiled young people to organize basic teams for political, economic, and cultural counterattacks. The guerrilla cadre training class is truly a furnace that produces new forces and unleashes guerrilla functions. From a military education perspective, this is also a product of historical contribution and a great era. We hope that more schools of this nature will be established.

On April 29, the Japanese increased their troops to Zhongxiang, Jingmen, and other areas in central Hubei. Part of Tang's army remained stationed on both sides of the Hanshui River. In order to facilitate command and give the Japanese a greater lesson, the authorities transferred General Tang Enbo, who instilled fear in the hearts of the Japanese soldiers, to the front line in northern Hubei to direct the battle. The work of the cadre training class was temporarily taken over by Li XX. For the students of the cadre training class, this was naturally a message that was both exciting and nostalgic. The exciting part was that the director of education could go to the front line and let the enemy stain the Xiang River with blood. The nostalgic part was that they were unwilling to have a short-term separation from this intelligent and forthright teacher. However, in any case, General Tang has decided to depart tomorrow. The entire XX town was filled with a fiery enthusiasm for the farewell, and the streets and alleys were covered with slogans of various colors, glorifying his heroic achievements and wishing the expeditionary soldiers victory.

After five o'clock, the XX River not far from the town was already crowded with people. The songs of the guerrillas soared into the clouds, and the bugles shook the air. Everyone's emotions were extremely excited. A stage has been set up in the venue, and it is said that tonight's program is very exciting, including songs, dramas, and Peking opera. The reporter walked around the stage and saw many young men and women from the Shanghai National Salvation Drama Troupe, speaking in the soft Wu dialect, which could not help but evoke memories of the scenery of Jiangnan, which has now become a dark world trampled under the iron hooves of the Japanese army, causing extraordinary indignation. After a while, the drums and music sounded together, and the entire audience fell silent. Bai Chongxi, Chen Chengxiu, Tang Enbo, Zhou Enlai, Liang Hancao, and others stepped into the venue with smiles, and the atmosphere gradually began to decrease from its highest point of tension, and slowly everyone was laughing together. The so-called potluck dinner also began, with students gathering in groups, some sitting and some standing, and everyone began to eat. The reporter and Mr. and Mrs. Li Meng were invited to sit in the first seat. While eating, Li Meng asked General Bai and Chen about the war situation in Nanchang. The reply was that we had advanced to the airport outside the city and the war was quite favorable. Therefore, they hoped to follow the army into Nanchang and report the news of the victory to the world first. Everyone's attitude seemed quite serious at the banquet, and there was simply no loud laughter. The students were still happier. After the meal, we rested in the reception room for a while. The meeting began at 6:15. General Bai Chongxi presided over the meeting and explained the meaning of the farewell to Director of Education Tang. Then he invited Tang to give a farewell speech, the content of which was roughly to review the past advantages and disadvantages, and to encourage the students to work hard as much as possible in the spirit of "learning as long as you live" advocated by Sun Yat-sen. Finally, he also quoted Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's saying "Guerrilla warfare is more important than regular warfare," Chief of General Staff Bai's saying "Guerrillas are revolutionary cadres," and Minister Chen's saying "Guerrilla warfare cannot be separated from the masses" to end the speech and elaborate on the great responsibility of the students. The entertainment program did not end until 12 o'clock at night. It was truly a memorable day.

British House of Lords Heatedly Discusses Aid to China - Demands Government Retaliate Against Japan - House of Commons Also Debates International Situation
[Reuters, London, 12th]
The House of Lords continued its foreign policy debate tonight. Lord Cecil rose from the opposition Labour benches and stated, "The contradictions on the two continents of Europe and Asia are absolutely the same. Only Asia is caught in a cruel vortex of war, while Europe has not yet suffered the scourge of war. I believe Foreign Secretary Halifax must share this view. Whether it is legitimate to use force to invade another country to obtain one's own material or governmental interests is a major issue that urgently needs to be resolved. Asia is now at war, with Japan invading China with unparalleled cruelty. Some in Germany must be extremely envious, but Europe will not allow the realization of such atrocities today. I would most earnestly wish the Foreign Secretary to provide assurance that we should do our best to assist China, expel Japan from Chinese territory, and not merely express the Foreign Secretary's personal sympathy for China. I deeply believe that every member of this House deeply sympathizes with China." Lord Elibank then spoke, stating, "The situation in the Far East is worse than at any time before. The traditional British trading area, the Yangtze River basin, is no longer accessible to us, while Japanese commerce is unimpeded. The Japanese issue counterfeit currency to disrupt finances and stipulate that the value of the Yokohama Specie Bank's currency is equal to the Chinese national currency and must be used. The Japanese have achieved some success because, in any case, people need to live. Regarding trade from Shanghai to British and American ports, I hope the government will guarantee the issuance of consular certificates to facilitate trade in British ports. The atrocities committed by the Japanese army in China have caused great disturbance and unease among British citizens in the Far East, and I hope the government will pay attention. If the Japanese implement a blockade of Tianjin, the government should immediately notify the Japanese government that Britain will also stop Japanese ships from using Singapore and Penang as transportation ports as retaliation. This is an absolutely legal action under international law. The Japanese are destroying our trade in China, and unless we take military action, this action of stopping Japan from using British ports is necessary. Recently, incidents between Britain and Japan have occurred repeatedly, and British citizens have died. I really do not know how to stop this. At a time when such incidents are constantly occurring, it is surprising to hear that a battalion of British troops stationed in Shanghai will be withdrawn in mid-September. Two battalions of British troops are already insufficient to defend the perimeter of the Shanghai International Settlement. If another battalion is withdrawn, the Japanese will surely see Britain as showing weakness and attempt to seize it, as they have done in Tianjin and Gulangyu. As far as I know, the rumors that Japan is plotting to seize the Shanghai Concession are not entirely unfounded. July 7th is the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War, which is a dangerous date. It is unwise to reduce our troop strength. We should send more troops and warships to ensure the safety of the Shanghai Concession. This action should be discussed jointly with the American and French authorities. The Japanese believe that occupying Chinese people under the protection of foreign flags is the best way to eliminate anti-Japanese movements in China. This has been done in Tianjin and Gulangyu, and it now appears to be about to be added to Shanghai. Once this happens, trade in Shanghai will be completely eliminated because Chinese people will quickly withdraw from Shanghai and go to the interior. Japan's seizure of Shanghai would not only be a fatal blow to Britain, but also a major blow to Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Therefore, I urge the government to take effective action early, before it is too late." Lord Davies then rose and stated, "Expressions of sympathy alone are insufficient. Small loans to China and allowing China to transport arms are commendable, but Foreign Secretary Halifax should take the lead in responding to Chinese representative Gu Weijun's appeal in Geneva. The current British policy has undermined the British Empire's inherent reputation for upholding justice." Foreign Secretary Halifax replied to the above questions separately, stating, "We are witnessing the conflict in the Far East, which is related to the entire issue of the rights of war. The British government has been constantly making efforts to deal with the war in the Far East in the past two years. The resolutions passed by the League of Nations, although their content is still far from the wishes of the Chinese government, are practically feasible for countries whose interests are significantly related to the Far East. Lord Davies has underestimated the efforts of the British government. Those familiar with the China issue should know that Britain's efforts to assist China's monetary system are a great help to China, enabling China to maintain the balance of its economic strength. Regarding the repeated destruction of British interests in China by the Japanese, the British government will resist any threat from any party. The difficult position in which the British government finds itself should be understood by Lord Elibank. I can assure him that the withdrawal of the upper army is completely unfounded. Regarding the deployment of the fleet stationed in China, the commander-in-chief of the fleet will act as he sees fit. Although the Japanese military authorities constantly use "military necessity" as an excuse to limit British rights, this is unacceptable to the British government, especially in some areas where military operations have long ceased. Other matters, such as unilateral changes to institutions organized by Britain and other countries, are also difficult for the British government to accept. The questions raised in this debate have all been raised to the Japanese side through notes or protests. The British government will make greater efforts to ensure that the rights and lives of British citizens in China are protected. Regarding the Captain Spiers incident, regardless of the Japanese excuse, he should be released immediately once his identity is proven. According to a report from Cooper of the British Embassy in China, although Spiers was detained, he is still receiving proper treatment. I predict that the Captain Spiers incident will be satisfactorily resolved. Regarding the Tinker incident, a protest has been lodged by the British Ambassador to Japan, and all rights to compensation for losses are reserved. Regarding the entire global situation, I have made a statement in my speech on June 8. British policy remains unchanged. What the British government wants to make clear is that those who use force against others today will be resisted by force. British-Soviet negotiations are currently underway in Moscow by Sir William Seeds, and I am unable to discuss them in detail at this time. Future progress will be announced. Regarding the Danzig issue, we must be more patient if we want to avoid the results of serious danger. I now reiterate Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement that while Britain wishes the German-Polish dispute could be resolved peacefully, any attempt to threaten Poland's independence by force will lead to a major war, in which Britain will also be caught up."

British-French-Soviet Negotiations Delayed - Chamberlain Expresses Regret
[Reuters, London, 12th]
After Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that no further additions to the report on British-Soviet negotiations were necessary, Labour MP Dr. Dalton immediately rose and questioned whether the Prime Minister had considered that the prolonged delay in the British-Soviet agreement had caused doubts in all quarters, and whether the government intended to procrastinate again in an attempt to restore its Munich policy. Chamberlain jumped up and angrily replied, "Dr. Dalton's question is deliberately slanderous. Can the delay in the agreement be blamed solely on Britain?" Labour MP Henderson then questioned what conditions must be met to convene a world conference that could genuinely resolve international problems. The Prime Minister replied that such an international conference must be attended by countries that are open and willing to resolve disputes through negotiations in order to be effective. The British government is still willing to make efforts in this regard at any time, and other governments must also work together. In answering questions about the Thetis submarine, Chamberlain stated that salvage work would restart within two or three weeks. Labour MP Fletcher rose amidst cheers from opposition members and asked if the Prime Minister was aware that the people were extremely eager for the government to salvage the submarine as soon as possible. Given the success of salvaging German sunken ships in Scapa Flow, the failure to salvage the Thetis submarine would inevitably cause a sense of serious unease. Chamberlain replied that the government was also eager to salvage the submarine.

Questions About the Tinker Incident - Butler Reports Progress [Reuters, London, 12th]
The case of Mr. Tinker, a British employee of the Shanghai Lun Chang Spinning Mill, who was stabbed to death on June 6 due to a conflict with the Japanese Marine Corps, was brought up for discussion in the House of Commons today. Under-Secretary of State Butler, after describing the events of the Lun Chang Spinning Mill strike on May 20, stated that on June 6, Chinese employees of the factory clashed with striking workers at the gate of the factory in Pudong. The Japanese Marine Corps then intervened. The facts are not yet clear, but Tinker appears to have fired a shot in an attempt to stop the conflict. Tinker was then stabbed by Japanese Marines with bayonets and died of serious injuries the following morning. The British Consul-General in Shanghai protested to the Japanese Consul-General regarding Tinker's stabbing, the Japanese authorities' refusal to return Tinker to the British authorities at the British authorities' request, and the Japanese authorities' refusal to allow British doctors to treat Tinker when his injuries were still minor. The British government also sent a note to Tokyo protesting these discriminatory actions against British citizens. All information that could be released has been provided to British and international news agencies. Labour MP Fletcher asked whether the government authorities had taken note of the fact that the Japanese searching British ships, seizing British property, and other anti-British actions had caused great public unease and whether there were preparations to take other steps besides protesting. Conservative MP Allan asked whether the government had made efforts to seek the truth of this matter. Butler gave an affirmative answer and said, "The reason we provided the information we obtained to British and international news agencies is precisely for this reason." Fletcher also asked whether the British government had the possibility of taking retaliatory measures. Butler said that the British government had already protested, so it was now appropriate to await the results. In answering a question from Labour MP Robart, Butler said that according to the information Foreign Secretary Halifax had received, Hainan Island was only partially occupied by the Japanese army. Regarding the Japanese on the Spratly Islands, there was no real military occupation. The British government is constantly maintaining close contact with the French government on this matter.

Japanese-German-Italian Conspiracy in the Works - Shiratori Arrives in Germany to Participate in Talks - Japanese Delay Causes German Dissatisfaction [Reuters, Berlin, 13th]
Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Shiratori, will arrive here today to meet with Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Oshima, to discuss Japanese suggestions to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact. In the past few days, Mr. Oshima has visited German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop several times. It is heard that Germany has expressed dissatisfaction with the delay in the negotiations, while Japan is more optimistic. The Japanese proposal was delivered here a week ago, but has not been made public.

Basic Techniques of Aggression - Germany Mentally Abuses Czechs - Czech Soldiers and Civilians Flee to Poland - Organize Secret Groups to Resist Germany - Germany Still Denies Formal Annexation of Czech Republic
[Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th]
Rumors that the current protection system in Bohemia and Moravia will be abolished and that the two provinces will be incorporated into German territory were denied by those responsible here.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 12th]
Information was recently received from the Czech border that Czech army officers are crossing the border into Poland in an endless stream. Many people from Bohemia and Moravia are also fleeing to Poland. According to reports, Czechs are organizing secret groups to resist Germany. Polish newspapers are paying close attention to the situation in Bohemia and Moravia, stating that the Czech resistance is becoming more intense and will become an international issue. In addition, the hostility of the Slovaks towards Germany is also increasing, and conflicts between the two groups are occurring frequently.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 10th]
Czech Ambassador to France, Mr. Osusky, recently stated in an interview with a reporter from "Le Jour" that the Czech nation has been wantonly trampled upon by other countries and is no longer an independent nation, but has become a part of Germany. German leader Hitler solemnly declared on March 16 of this year, the day after his country annexed Bohemia and Moravia, that he would respect the independence of the Czech people. At that time, there were no atrocities committed in the province under German rule. Czech civil servants were still able to remain in their positions, and the people were not mistreated. However, times have changed, and the previous words have been overturned. Recently, many Czech employees in public and private institutions have been dismissed and replaced by Germans. The people's possessions and food have been requisitioned, and goods have been confiscated. Iron, livestock, timber, sugar, etc., must be confiscated. Cloth is scarce and prices are skyrocketing. Meat is no longer affordable for ordinary people. Families with moderate wealth have become impoverished. What is even more unbearable is that the Czech people have been deprived of their basic freedoms, and patriotic movements have been banned. German Minister Frank publicly declared yesterday that the Czech people have no right to enjoy independence and that their only responsibility is to work hard and seek the welfare of Greater Germany. However, the Czech people will never be willing to submit to this kind of abuse.

Hong Kong News: Submarine Water Pipe Hong Kong Section Completed; Full-Day Water Supply Restored; Kowloon Section to Face Water Suspension for Three More Days During Pipe Connection; Entire Project Expected to Be Completed by Mid-Next Month

To enhance the water supply to Hong Kong, the Waterworks Department has installed a submarine water pipe to transport water from the Shing Mun Reservoir to Hong Kong. This installation project began in November last year and has lasted for several months. As of now, the submarine pipe has been installed. On the Hong Kong side, only a few remaining sections need to be connected to the main pipe underground at Queen's Pier for completion. To facilitate the connection work, the Waterworks Director announced a temporary water suspension for three days, starting at 9:00 PM on the 11th of this month, with only ten hours of water supply per day. During the water suspension period, the connection of the main pipe was completed. According to Waterworks Director Wood, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the connection of the main pipe underground at Queen's Pier was completed this (yesterday) morning. Full-day water supply will resume as scheduled from 4:00 PM this (yesterday) afternoon. In the future, when the new pipe is connected to the main pipe underground at the Kowloon Railway Station, the Hong Kong area will again face a temporary water suspension for three days. This section of the project is expected to be completed by mid-next month. The new pipe has a larger diameter than the old pipe and is specially manufactured to be durable and non-corrosive, with an effective life of over ten years without replacement. The total project cost is approximately $900,000. After the new pipe is installed, the water supply from the Shing Mun Reservoir will be temporarily increased by one million gallons per day. Once the "Shing Mun Reservoir Plan" proposed by the water authorities is completed, the daily water supply to Hong Kong can be increased to 1.6 million gallons. The installation of the new submarine pipe is closely related to the "Shing Mun Reservoir Plan."

Hong Kong Women's Relief Association Branch Holds Regular Meeting Yesterday

Collecting Small Antiques to Send to England for Sale; Decision to Send Letters Inviting Various Organizations to Participate in the Charity

The Hong Kong Women's Relief Association held a committee meeting yesterday morning at 11:00 AM. Shen Huilian, the General Affairs Director of the General Association, attended the meeting to report on the general work of the General Association over the past two years. Attendees included He Baofang, Wu Yanzhuang, Xu Jun, Liao Mengxing, Yan Cheng, Rong Yuzhi, Hu Mulan, Du Ruolian, Wu Yazhi, He Xiangning, and Zhu Xianzhen. Shen Huilian and Ye Shaoshang attended as observers. Xu Jun chaired the meeting, and Wu Yanzhuang served as the recorder. The meeting commenced with Shen Huilian's report, providing a detailed account of the General Association's work over the past two years and the recent rescue of children, including the following key points: (1) After the July 7th Incident, Madame Chiang Kai-shek immediately convened women's organizations to form a relief association, engaging in relief work with great enthusiasm. (2) After the retreat from Nanjing, witnessing the suffering of children under the abuse of × people, the association felt deeply saddened and established a children's welfare society to shelter and care for the children. (3) Women's work teams were added to serve the war zone and frontline soldiers. Despite enduring great suffering, the soldiers expressed no complaints and were deeply grateful for the full service of the women's community. Currently, there are thousands of wounded soldiers, many of whom are disabled from bombings. While the soldiers' food is good, they lack shoes, socks, clothes, and handkerchiefs, requiring urgent assistance. There are over 17,000 war orphans, all with strong nationalistic sentiments. Chongqing has been making every effort to accommodate them. Those aged fifteen or sixteen are mostly engaged in quarrying or agricultural work and other productive activities. (4) After Chongqing was brutally bombed by × aircraft, the morale of the military and civilians in resisting the war increased. Previously, the people of Sichuan were slow to rise in the morning and indulged in opium. Since the national government moved to Chongqing, their lives have improved. The recent disaster resulted in over 10,000 deaths and injuries. Ms. Shen also suggested that the children's welfare society should provide as much accommodation as possible to disaster area refugees, providing them with mental training. The lack of medicine is particularly acute, and she hopes that all parties will make efforts to donate. She also mentioned that during her trip to the south, she was instructed by Madame Chiang to collect small domestic items and antiques to send to London for sale, using the funds to provide relief to wounded soldiers and refugees. She urged the Hong Kong branch to take responsibility for planning and implementation to facilitate the process. The General Association deeply admired the efforts and outstanding achievements of the Hong Kong branch in its past work. The Standing Committee decided to send letters to prominent women and organizations in Hong Kong, including Madame Sun Yat-sen Soong Ching-ling, Madame Kung Soong Ai-ling, Madame Soong Chang-lo Yi, Madame Liao He Xiangning, and Madame Wu He Baofang, inviting them to participate in the charity together. A tea party was scheduled for 4:00 PM on the 16th to discuss the arrangements. The original letter is recorded below: "Respectfully," Yesterday, we received a letter from Madame Chiang, stating that Madame Guo Taiqi, wife of our ambassador to England, wrote that charity sales are the most effective way to raise funds abroad for our country. She requested that women in the country be mobilized to donate small items for sale in England. However, due to × aircraft bombings in the interior, people are constantly moving, making it difficult to collect items there. She instructed us to launch a collection campaign in Hong Kong to contribute to the good cause. We have scheduled a discussion meeting for 4:00 PM on the 16th of this month, with light refreshments, to show our respect. We respectfully request your presence at the meeting to plan the arrangements together. Thank you."

Cholera Cases Increasing in Hong Kong; Ships Leaving Hong Kong for Xiamen Must Enter Restricted Waters for Inspection

The health authorities reported that on Sunday, ten new cases of cholera were reported in Hong Kong, bringing the total to seventy-seven cases. On the same day, there were also seven new cases of typhoid, four cases of measles, one case of meningitis (imported), one case of postpartum fever, five cases of dysentery, and twenty-seven cases of tuberculosis. According to a notice issued by the Assistant Colonial Secretary's Office yesterday morning, the Xiamen Customs authorities have announced that all ships arriving from Hong Kong must enter restricted waters for inspection due to the cholera outbreak in Hong Kong. Passengers traveling from Hong Kong to Egypt by plane must also have a certificate of cholera vaccination, otherwise they will be detained for inspection. The authorities of the Dutch East Indies and the Straits Settlements have also announced Hong Kong as a port where cholera has occurred, restricting the freedom of passengers arriving from Hong Kong to disembark.

Zhonghua Yixue Announces Teacher Appointments; 144 Teachers to Be Appointed in Hong Kong and Kowloon First; School Opens on the 18th, Report by the 15th

The Guangdong Relief Committee's Hong Kong and Macau War Refugee Relief Committee, in order to provide relief to war refugees who have dropped out of school and unemployed teachers in Hong Kong and Macau, has established Zhonghua Yixue and conducted a registration of unemployed teachers. A total of 1,520 teachers registered. Later, 300 were selected using a priority method and a lottery method. However, due to the current number of classes set at only 132, not all of the selected teachers could be employed. Therefore, the committee, in order to find a flexible solution, has decided to first employ 144 teachers from the Hong Kong and Kowloon areas according to the order of priority and lottery selection. Those who have not been employed will be employed when the number of classes is increased in the future. The list of teachers who have been employed was released yesterday.

Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to Discuss Today: Question of Library Retention

Achievements Have Been Improving Since Its Establishment; Proposal to Close Is Incomprehensible

The public library run by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce has been established for several years, and the number of readers has been increasing daily. Compared with the number of readers in 1929, the increase in the number of readers has reached over 70,000. From this, it can be seen that the number of illiterate people is gradually decreasing. However, in the midst of this growing success, some people have proposed that the library's existence is a waste of funds, which is incomprehensible. Since the question of the library's retention has been raised, it has not only aroused the resentment of the Chamber of Commerce's directors but has also been criticized by public opinion. The proposers have been attacked, and it is generally believed that such reckless actions should not be taken during the war. The question of the library's retention will be raised for discussion at today's general meeting. The general public hopes that the proposers will withdraw their proposal. A systematic statistical survey comparing the number of readers and the number of books borrowed over the years is as follows: (1929) Number of readers: 37,953, Average daily: 145; Number of books borrowed: 44,753, Average daily: 172; (1930) Number of readers: 45,753, Average daily: 165; Number of books borrowed: 62,322, Average daily: 224; (1931) Number of readers: 53,854, Average daily: 184; Number of books borrowed: 72,299, Average daily: 247; (1932) Number of readers: 56,162, Average daily: 96; Number of books borrowed: 74,690, Average daily: 261; (1933) Number of readers: 58,205, Average daily: 212; Number of books borrowed: 78,073, Average daily: 285; (1934) Number of readers: 53,310, Average daily: 189; Number of books borrowed: 72,219, Average daily: 256; (1935) Number of readers: 67,038, Average daily: 226; Number of books borrowed: 151,750, Average daily: 511; (1936) Number of readers: 81,910, Average daily: 297; Number of books borrowed: 111,426, Average daily: 476; (The number of books borrowed was slightly reduced this year because the library was used as an office for the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese's celebration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's birthday and the dedication of aircraft memorial meeting, and the library was closed for about a month.) (1937) Number of readers: 102,977, Average daily: 351; Number of books borrowed: 183,709, Average daily: 627; (1938) Number of readers: 118,354, Average daily: 434; Number of books borrowed: 244,141, Average daily: 894.

Air Raid Siren Sounded the Day Before Yesterday; Not an Air Defense Drill

At 3:00 PM on the 12th, the air raid siren in the Central District suddenly sounded, with a wailing sound that lasted for 30 seconds. Pedestrians along the way thought that the authorities were suddenly conducting an emergency air defense drill, but it stopped shortly after, and there was no special situation in the city. After inquiring with the Air Defense Headquarters, Steve Lubekins stated that the sirens that had been transported to Hong Kong recently were placed at designated locations. The sudden sounding was not an air raid drill. It was probably due to the alarm being moved to a fixed location, which touched the current, causing a short sound.

Heavy Rain Yesterday; Two Inches of Rain Received; Total Rainfall This Year Reaches Over 46 Inches

Hong Kong experienced heavy rain yesterday morning, with a total rainfall of over two inches. Rain fell from 0:00 AM to 9:00 AM yesterday morning, with a confirmed rainfall of 2.645 inches. As of 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the total rainfall in Hong Kong this year was 46.35 inches. The rainfall during the same period last year was only 29.34 inches, which is 17 inches less than this year.

Kowloon Peninsula Pig Farming Issue; Authorities Determined to Ban; Villagers Petition to Revoke the Ban; Approval Refused; Second Petition Submitted

For the sake of protecting the health of residents and facilitating sanitation administration, the Hong Kong Municipal Health Bureau recently implemented the 1935 regulations banning pig farming in the rural areas of the Kowloon Peninsula to avoid affecting the health of all residents and hindering sanitation administration. However, due to the impact on their livelihoods, the villagers spent a great deal of money to hire Lawyer Deakin to appeal to the authorities to revoke the ban. After receiving the Deputy Governor's reply, Lawyer Deakin informed Huang Yangyou, the manager of the Kowloon Chinese Chamber of Commerce, that since the authorities were determined to ban pig farming in the rural areas of the Kowloon Peninsula, the villagers who wished to continue animal husbandry and cultivation must move to several designated alternative areas in the New Territories. However, few of the villagers are wealthy, and the cost of relocation and establishing a new business in the future is difficult to resolve. It is better to request the authorities to take into account the difficulties of the people and have the government purchase all the existing fields and houses in the rural areas of the Kowloon Peninsula so that they can use the funds to relocate. After consideration, this move is sufficient to delay the authorities' implementation of the ban, which is an opportunity to be taken, and it is also a difficult problem to solve. Therefore, they paid another handling fee of $100 and submitted another petition to the authorities based on this reason, requesting the Hong Kong government to consider a solution. However, the farmers declared that requesting the government to purchase all the fields and houses was no different from seeking their own death. The villagers generally did not express sympathy for this move, and the progress of this matter did not obtain the consent of the farmers, so they all held different opinions. Moreover, the traditional Chinese virtues of honesty and integrity mean that they would never be willing to destroy the ancestral property unless absolutely necessary. If the authorities ban pig farming, they can still raise livestock such as chickens and ducks and continue their pastoral life, maintaining their future livelihoods and living in peace and prosperity. Moreover, the impossibility of relocating to the New Territories has been explained in detail by the person in charge of the Planting Research Chamber of Commerce and published in major Hong Kong newspapers a few days ago, so there is no need to repeat it. Therefore, the villagers did not consider Lawyer Deakin's appeal to the authorities to be acceptable. Even if the authorities approve the request in the future, it is believed that none of the villagers will be willing to comply. It can only be regarded as Huang's personal opinion. The reason why we spent our hard-earned money to raise funds for negotiation is to ask the authorities to understand our suffering and revoke the ban to allow us to continue raising pigs.

Furthermore, a senior official of the Health Bureau stated that the authorities' ban on pig farming in the rural areas of the Kowloon Peninsula was implemented after a long period of on-site research and careful consideration. No matter which aspect, it has been given attention. The facts over the years have shown that the pig farming that hinders sanitation in such a close proximity to the urban area must be eliminated in order to benefit the health of all residents. The authorities' policy focuses on the big picture and cannot be influenced by the dispensable things of a few people and affect the public. It is believed that the villagers of the Kowloon Peninsula can maintain their livelihoods by raising livestock such as chickens and ducks and planting vegetables without raising pigs. Therefore, for the sake of the health of more than one million residents, the authorities are determined to implement the ban strictly and are preparing all the steps to send staff from the Kowloon Peninsula Health Organization to various villages from Saturday and Sunday (the 17th) to investigate. Those who have not obtained a license and violate the order will be severely punished according to the law, and the police will assist in everything.

Shaoguan in Wartime Robes: Principal Chen Bingquan's Talk on Attending the Senate and Returning to Hong Kong - A Special Feature by Qi Zhuo

To what extent has the Guangdong Senate, which established the foundation of democratic politics in Guangdong Province, achieved? What kind of posture has the wartime capital of Guangdong Province, which is also the center of South China, adopted? ... These are the questions that patriotic overseas Chinese, especially those from Guangdong who are preparing to return to their hometown, are concerned about.

Chen Bingquan, the principal of Guangzhou University, is a current member of the Guangdong Senate. He went to Shaoguan earlier this month to attend the first Senate meeting and returned to Hong Kong a few days ago. The reporter specifically went to Guangzhou University to interview Principal Chen. The general impression of Shaoguan is probably like this:

The first Senate meeting of Guangdong Province opened on May 15 and successfully closed on the 28th, lasting for two weeks. In addition to the authorities reporting on the general situation of administration to facilitate consultations by the senators, the agenda also addressed the needs of the objective current situation and passed many proposals that should be implemented and reformed. The original text has been published in various newspapers in Hong Kong, so there is no need to repeat it here. Under the lessons of blood, the Guangdong authorities are now striving to govern, and it is believed that they will be able to accept public opinion and earnestly adopt the proposals. We hereby express our sincere hopes.

There are also two major events in the Senate itself that are worth praising. One is the senators' inspection of various regions; the other is sending personnel abroad to comfort overseas Chinese. In order to clarify officialdom, strengthen the power of resistance, and comfort overseas Chinese to encourage the rescue of the motherland, these, needless to say, are urgent tasks to be carried out. We also believe that the Senate will carry out this sacred task well.

A major event in terms of administration is that the Political Department of the Fourth War Zone held a cadre training group for party, government, and military personnel. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek served as the head of the group, and General Zhang Fakui served as the deputy head. Cadres from all levels in Guangdong, Guangxi, and southern Jiangxi were transferred to Shaoguan for training. Those receiving training in the "party" aspect were the secretaries-general of the party headquarters in each county; those in the "government" aspect were the county magistrates and section chiefs; those in the "military" aspect were officers above the rank of lieutenant; and those in the "education" aspect were the principals and training directors of secondary schools. They were drawn in three phases so that they could generally complete the training. Each phase lasted for two weeks and focused on spiritual training. The first phase has ended, and the second phase has begun. There are currently 740 people, with those in the "military" aspect accounting for more than 500. In the context of a shortage of cadres and the imperfect lower-level institutions, this should be a very meaningful event. Looking north, we are so excited!

Shaoguan, under the leadership of the wise and hardworking Generals Zhang Fa and others, is indeed wearing wartime robes. Principal Chen said with great interest: If there is an air raid by × aircraft, an alarm will be issued 30 minutes in advance. In addition to various sirens, a symbol like a "storm ball" is hung high - one for the first air raid alert and two for the emergency alert - and all the people disperse in a very orderly manner. In a moment, the whole city is empty, and there is no chaos. This is probably the best managed in the country.

Some of the residents of Shaoguan have dispersed to the suburbs, but they come back at night, so Shaoguan at night is very lively and prosperous. The rear area in wartime shows a stable and resolute state. The military and civilians are inspired by General Zhang Fakui's hard work from morning to night, and there is a reason for them to be ready to fight at any time.

Since June 1, the provincial government has implemented joint office work. However, this is to facilitate the unification of government orders. Outgoing official documents use the name of the provincial government instead of the name of the department. In fact, the departments are still scattered in various villages to make it difficult for × people's bombing.

The printing industry in the interior is very difficult. The newspapers in Shaoguan are mostly small. Printing business cards is not easy because transportation is inconvenient, and Hong Kong newspapers are rare in the interior. Only in Heyuan and Huiyang are they worth one cent per copy as usual.

After the destruction of the highway, transportation is very inconvenient. Principal Chen set off from Hong Kong on the 10th of last month, passing through Shantou, Chao'an, Huang, Xingning, Longzhou, Heping, Dingnan, Longnan Xinfeng, and Nanxiong in Jiangxi, taking a big circle and spending nine days to reach Qujiang. He started from Shaoguan on the 3rd of this month to return to Hong Kong, also passing through Nanxiong, Xinfeng, Longnan, Dingnan, Heping, and transferring to a boat to Longchuan, and then from Heyuan, Huiyang, Danshui, and Shayuchong, spending seven or eight days to arrive safely in Hong Kong. Senator Jin Zengcheng also accompanied Principal Chen. Speaker Wu Dingxin is still on official business in Shaoguan.

Today's Shaoguan is like Guangzhou in the era of the Eastern Expedition and the Northern Expedition. We must protect it, build it, and praise it so that it can exert its great power.

An Unprecedented Event in the Hong Kong Drama Circle; United Performance by Drama Actors Staying in Hong Kong; "Before Dawn" to Be Performed at the Lee Theatre in the Middle of This Month; A Special Feature by Shi Liang

An Unprecedentedly Grand Event in the Hong Kong Drama Circle: United Performance by Drama Actors Staying in Hong Kong; "Before Dawn" to Be Performed at the Lee Theatre in the Middle of This Month

The Hong Kong drama movement has been making rapid progress in recent years, and the progress has been even more remarkable in recent months. The residence in Hong Kong of famous domestic drama groups and drama actors with extremely high reputations in the drama circle is undoubtedly an important factor in promoting the progress of the drama movement. Recently, in order to further unite themselves and at the same time plan to present the highest level of drama works at the current stage to the people of Hong Kong, the drama workers staying in Hong Kong decided to hold a joint grand performance. The date has been set for the 16th and 17th of this month, and the venue is the Lee Theatre. This is an unprecedentedly large-scale joint performance by drama actors. Those participating in this performance include the "China Traveling Drama Troupe," the "China Art Drama Troupe," and the "China National Salvation Drama Troupe." These drama troupes are all the best in the country and represent the peak of the drama movement at the current stage. This is something everyone knows.

This joint grand performance is also their first time working together so closely. Those participating in the performance, such as Tang Huaiqiu, Tang Ruoqing, Yang Wei, Jiang Ming, Li Jingbo, Jin Shan, Wang Ying, Fan Zheng, Deng Zhujun, Tang Ruoying, Tong Yi, Zhang Lide, etc., are all outstanding drama actors with deep attainments in various groups. They have a long history of working hard in the drama movement, and in this large-scale joint performance, they are all playing unique roles and earnestly taking on their work.

In this joint grand performance, those responsible for stage design, lighting, costumes, props, effects, etc., are all people who regularly take on this kind of work in various groups. This time, they have gone through a considerable period of preparation, and the perfection and greatness are self-evident. Audiences who have seen their previous performances should remember that every time the curtain is raised, before the actors come on stage, the applause from the audience is already aroused by the magnificence of the scenery. This time, because it is a joint performance, this aspect will naturally be even more outstanding.

This performance, in terms of the scale, the selection of people, and everything else, is unprecedented. They are carrying out this performance work under an unprecedented unity. I think it will definitely cause a sensation throughout Hong Kong, and it will definitely let the audiences in Hong Kong know the form of the highest peak of the current drama movement, and it will definitely further lay the foundation for a new stage of drama.

It is heard that the play has been set as "Before Dawn." It includes four independent plays, all of which are the best works of the past twenty-two months. They have been performed countless times in the country and have won the love of thousands of audiences. What is described are all the touching stories before dawn, the prelude to dawn, and the thriving seedlings of the new culture! They are also representative works of playwrights.

The "China National Salvation Drama Troupe" has performed twice at the Lee Theatre since arriving in Hong Kong. Now, the troupe is about to go abroad, and this performance is probably the last performance. Who among those who have seen the troupe's performances would want to miss this opportunity?

Unprecedented unity, great performance, and the highest level of art will leave a new imprint on the history of drama and give the audience an unprecedented opportunity for appreciation. I can't help but be awakened by it!

Severe Rice Shortage in Various Counties; Chambers of Commerce of Various Counties in Hong Kong Rush to Provide Relief at Low Prices; Another Batch of Relief Rice Arrives in Town; Further Request to the Ministry of Finance to Increase the Amount of Tax-Exempt Rice

Since the occurrence of rice shortages in the counties of Dongxin, Kai, En, Tai, Zhongshan, and Shunde, the central government has approved the tax-free import of foreign rice, and the chambers of commerce of various counties in Hong Kong have raised funds to purchase rice and return to their hometowns to organize sales at low prices. Although the price of rice can be temporarily lowered, due to the large population of each county and the limitation of tax-free imports, it is not enough to distribute. Therefore, the severity of the rice shortage has not been reduced so far. In most areas of the four counties and Zhongshan, the price of rice is still expensive, and the people's livelihood is greatly affected. Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, with the aim of providing relief to their hometowns, are still constantly working hard to raise funds to organize sales at low prices to provide relief.

A Batch of Relief Rice Arrives in Lan Town

Regarding Zhongshan, since the occurrence of the rice shortage in the county, the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has raised funds to purchase rice and transport it back to various districts of the county to organize sales at low prices. Numerous batches have been shipped from Hong Kong, with a total of about 40,000 bags. However, the area of the county is vast and the population is large. This small number of tens of thousands of bags of rice is a drop in the bucket and does not help. Therefore, after the previously transported relief rice was sold out, the price of rice rose again. Recently, the fellows association of Lan Town in Hong Kong has again raised funds and assisted by the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce to purchase rice and return to their hometown for relief. This batch of relief rice, totaling more than 2,000 bags, was recently escorted by Chen Zhongchi, a member of the Zhongshan Relief Association, to Macau, from where it was transferred to Lan Town. The transportation and import procedures were carried out smoothly with the assistance of the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce and the county government.

Rice Shortage in the Interior Still Severe

Chen Zhongchi, the member who escorted the batch of relief rice, returned to Hong Kong from Zhongshan yesterday. He told reporters that after more than 2,000 bags of relief rice were transported back to Lan Town, they were handed over to the local Chongde Charity Hospital for sale at low prices. The method was still the same as the previous batches: the heads of various Baojia issued relief certificates, and then the residents of various neighborhoods purchased rice with the certificates. The rice shortage situation in Lan Town is still severe. Initially, the price of rice rose to only four to five Jin per yuan. After Hong Kong transported rice for relief, the price of rice returned to six to seven Jin per yuan. However, because the local population has greatly increased compared to before, the low-priced rice cannot be maintained for long. Once it is sold out, the price of rice will rise again. At the most expensive time, only three Jin were sold per yuan, and countless poor people went hungry due to the rice shortage. Since the recent batch of more than 2,000 bags of relief rice were transported back from Hong Kong, the poor in the county can get seven Jin per yuan, and their lives are slightly less difficult.

Organizing Congee to Relieve Hungry People

However, there are many compatriots in the countryside who have been greatly affected by the war and are suffering from the high price of rice. Countless people are unable to cook. Therefore, the local fellows association has launched a congee distribution campaign, which has already begun, and is soliciting donations from fellows in Hong Kong to provide relief to their hometowns. The original text of the donation solicitation is: Public announcement: Our town is now in the off-season, and the price of rice is soaring, with only three or four Jin sold per yuan, so that the poor cannot make ends meet. Our association, seeing this, has united with enthusiastic people in the town to launch low-priced sales, and rice has been transported back one after another, which is really a life-saving measure. However, our association feels that it cannot reach those who are unable to buy rice. Therefore, based on the principle of doing good with others, we will again organize congee distribution to provide relief. We hope that kind gentlemen will show their compassion and contribute generously, no matter how much or little, so that the general public who are unable to buy rice can relieve their hunger and thirst. Our association has high hopes for this."

Requesting the Ministry of Finance to Increase the Tax-

### Women's Class in the Mountains

— Bai Cuizhen

(News from Shengxi) In Shengxi, nestled within these mountains, the emergence of a people's literacy class is, I dare say, an unprecedented event. This literacy class has been running for over two months. To avoid interfering with their work hours, two literacy classes were established: a daytime class from 1 PM to 3 PM, exclusively for women, and a nighttime class from 7 PM to 9 PM, exclusively for men. Twenty-six men registered for the men's class. However, due to their work as stonemasons, sand collectors, and traders, and sometimes being in mines or traveling to distant markets, they cannot always return in time. Consequently, each class typically has around [number missing] students. The subjects taught include Mandarin, general knowledge, arithmetic, current events, and singing. Now, I want to focus specifically on the situation of the women's class.

In the women's class, seven members attend every day. The oldest is thirty years old, and the youngest is only sixteen. Two of them bring their children to class every day. A discussion forum is held once a week, with the following topics: (1) how to raise children, (2) what women should do in the people's liberation movement, (3) who are the Japanese invading China, (4) why Chinese women suffer so much, (5) why Soviet women live so comfortably, and (6) how can we find a path to happiness. Naturally, these questions are discussed in a way that appeals to them. I remember during the first discussion forum, none of them were willing to speak. I tried my best to encourage them to talk and started by saying, "Today, let's just chat casually. How about everyone sharing about their family life? Let's start with Bai Cuizhen." They secretly pushed each other, but no one wanted to speak.

In this situation, I could only talk about matters that were most relevant to them. I started by asking, "Whose husband has the best temper?" They all laughed and blushed simultaneously, seemingly embarrassed. I had to continue, "I know your husbands must treat you very well, unlike the terrible customs elsewhere, where men oppress women to death. Many men smoke, drink, gamble, and completely ignore their family responsibilities. The wives can only endure everything. If their wives tell them not to do those improper things, they'll be beaten." Yang Chunxi, who was sitting across from me, said with resentment, "Hmph, isn't mine like that? Fortunately, the government sent him to repair roads. If he were home, I wouldn't have a single happy day, let alone think about studying! It makes me furious! He doesn't have a roof over his head or anything solid under his feet. My own food and clothing come from helping people sew and wash clothes and collecting cinnabar. Yet, he still constantly asks me for money to smoke and gamble! If I don't give it to him, I get beaten. I just hope he dies out there and doesn't come back! I'm much happier at home alone, studying and helping people with work." Liu [character missing]zhen, seeing Chunxi's intensity, voluntarily began to share her hardships: "You, and me too! Haven't you all seen it with your own eyes? That good-for-nothing often beats me until my hands are swollen and my face is bruised, and he tells me to get out, saying he bought me with his mother's head, and he doesn't want me. I not only have to endure his beatings and scolding, but I also have to put up with my in-laws and my husband's younger sister. Fortunately, that good-for-nothing was sent to repair roads, and Mr. Cha talked to my mother-in-law and insisted that I come to study. Otherwise, I would only be able to study in my next life. I would never have imagined studying in this life. My suffering is truly endless." She started to cry. Tian Laocui said, "Don't cry. People like us can only blame our bad fate. We didn't cultivate virtue in our previous life. My husband is busy all day with his opium addiction. I use the little money I save from washing clothes to set up a stall and do some small business to support me and my child. A husband like that is better than having no husband at all." Yang Linzhi: "Crying is useless. There's only one solution: fight him! If you can't beat him, we'll unite and help each other! Or drag him to the government and sue him. My husband used to beat me for any little thing, grabbing my hair and hitting me. One time he beat me so badly that I couldn't take it anymore. I desperately dragged him to the government, and he was given dozens of blows to the buttocks. After that, he never dared to hit me so easily again." (Everyone applauded.)

Finally, I said, "That's right! We shouldn't think that women should be abused by men. We need to be stronger. Women's abilities are no less than men's. Many female soldiers on the front lines are fighting alongside men ××××——Women today cannot be as weak as women in the past, submitting to men in everything. This era is a new era. Women of the new era must fight for all their freedom and equality. We shouldn't say that we have bad luck. Happiness is created by ourselves. However, in China currently oppressed by Japanese imperialism, we can only help in the war of resistance to achieve freedom and liberation. How can we help the war of resistance? Of course, it would be even better to go to the front lines. If we can't go to the front, we can do production work in the rear to support the war effort. Sewing clothes and shoes for the soldiers on the front lines, helping the soldiers on the front lines care for their children and take care of their elderly parents, comforting wounded soldiers, serving wounded soldiers, and so on. Not only should we do this ourselves, but we should also mobilize the people in the countryside to do the same. Because only by uniting the people can we drive out Japanese imperialism. Only after Japanese imperialism is driven out can a new country be realized. Only then will we have good days."

Their progress is rapid. Initially, they were women who didn't know a single character, were well-behaved, and didn't speak. But after two months of studying, they are completely different. Now they can give speeches on stage, participate in singing, and do propaganda work during market days. They can keep diaries. Now, excerpts from their diaries are written below.

Today is Monday. After Mandarin class, we had a memorial week. Mr. Cha told us that Wuhan has been captured, and our area is also in danger. If they come, we will join the guerrilla force because I heard Mr. Cha say that the guerrilla force is organized by the people, with both men and women, and they are very powerful. I also heard Mr. Cao say one day that there is an old woman named Zhao in Northeast China, her hair is all white, and she is still a leader in the guerrilla force! I hope we can organize a guerrilla force here soon. We must all work together with one heart and unite firmly, so that ××××× none of them are left in China. If the country is lost, men will not have good days, and women will have even worse days! (Yang Chunxi, November 23)

Yesterday I went to school to study. Mr. Cha told us that ×××× has been defeated by China. Now our compatriots should work harder and intensify their efforts to defeat Japanese imperialism! (Yang Linzhi, November 23)

Today I heard Mr. Xiao doing propaganda on the street, saying that the Japanese devils are insulting our Chinese women, killing many of our compatriots, seizing our land, and bombing Changde. When I heard this, I was really angry! (Liu [character missing]zhen, November 25)

One day I heard that Mr. Cha was leaving, and I couldn't concentrate on studying. The next day, I heard that it was uncertain, and I was very happy! Since he came here, we have learned about many countries. Now our knowledge is also improving day by day. I hope all our classmates will strive forward and walk on that path to happiness! (Bai Cuizhen, October 3)

Today we had another meeting to discuss what women should do during this war of resistance. Later, Mr. Cha also proposed that we participate in the propaganda work done by the men's school every time we go to the market. We all agreed, but I agreed with my mouth, but I was very scared in my heart, because I didn't know what to say during the propaganda. Later, Mr. Cha said that two days before each market day, we will discuss the propaganda materials, and everyone will take turns giving speeches and decide who will give the speech. The day before going to the market, when we go to class, we will practice speaking, and Mr. Cha will supplement anything that is incorrect. After I knew these situations, I was not afraid anymore, and I was very happy in my heart, because the people in our area look down on women. If we can go to the streets to give speeches and let them see it, they will know that we women are also useful!

### The Problem of Women's Liberation in the War of Resistance

(Guilin Correspondence) Mr. Chen Yiyun, a member of the Women's Movement Committee of the Central Social Department of the Chinese Kuomintang, the leader of the Battlefield Service Group of the Women's Guidance Committee of the New Life Movement Headquarters, and the editor-in-chief of the Women's Resonance Monthly, is a respected leader in the women's community.

Recently, Mr. Chen came to Guilin from Qiyang, Hunan, with two missions. The first was to arrange for printing matters and prepare to move the "Women's Resonance" magazine to Guilin for publication. This is welcome news, as Guilin, as the heart of southwestern China, desperately needs a publication to guide women's work. The second was to purchase a large batch of medicines and hope that all sectors of society can do their best to donate to him, because since the fall of Nanchang, Hengyang, which has suffered a major bombing, has been unable to obtain medicines, and the suffering villagers are in dire need of medical supplies.

Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, Mr. Chen has traveled around, enthusiastically leading women in rescue work. Half a year ago, she was commissioned by Madame Chiang to serve as the captain of the Women's Battlefield Service Team, leading more than a hundred female comrades to do rural mobilization work in various counties of Hunan. After working for half a year, passing through more than ten counties, she gained a lot of valuable work experience. The team is still working in the Hengshan area.

During this busy schedule, she took the time to come to Guilin for only a few days' stay and will soon return to Qiyang. During these few days, she talked with Guangxi women leaders Madame Li, Madame Bai, Madame Huang, and women's work cadres. Mr. Chen expressed his deep admiration for the soundness of Guangxi's political organization and various implementations, and talked about how Guangxi's women's movement should expand to the countryside in the future, so that educated women can better play their leading role and complete the broad mobilization of Guangxi women.

A few days ago, all the female staff members of the Guangxi Provincial Government gathered in the auditorium of the Provincial Government to listen to Mr. Chen's speech on the problem of women's liberation in the War of Resistance, recounting the past and present of the Chinese women's movement. After more than twenty years of struggle, the reason why the Chinese women's movement has not made much progress is that now, in the political departments of the front-line troops, there are still very few female political workers, and there are still heartbreaking phenomena such as women living a hellish life in the middle. These are all because women have superficially obtained equal rights with men in politics and economics, but in fact, due to the poverty of women's political awareness and various knowledge abilities, they have given up many rights and delayed the struggle for their own liberation. Therefore, if women want to obtain various political and economic rights after the victory of the War of Resistance, they must strengthen their political and various cultivation in the War of Resistance and strengthen the work of the War of Resistance. Finally, she said that there are more than seventy female staff members in the Guangxi Provincial Government. This good phenomenon is not available in other provinces. The arduous struggle of Guangxi women has always been praised. But I hope to work harder, especially the backbone of women in the provincial government who are in a leading position, should use their position and ability to mobilize and organize rural women and working women. An organized and powerful women's mass is the cornerstone of women's liberation and the victory of the War of Resistance. (Hao)

### The Situation in the Tianjin Concession is Precarious British Prepare to Cope with Contingencies The Japanese Attitude Toward Britain is Still Extremely Tough China Insists on Opposing Compromise

[Reuters, Tianjin, 13th] As the Japanese threaten to blockade the Tianjin concession, the British do not feel nervous but express their determination to cope with contingencies. However, the current situation here is already very serious. The British authorities have taken preventive measures. The Doughty Light Infantry patrols the border of the concession at any time. The Japanese commander here issued a public announcement today, stating that from 6 AM tomorrow morning, traffic between the British and French concessions and the Japanese area will be suspended. All pedestrians and vehicles will not be allowed to pass. The international bridge will be closed from 6 AM to midnight. Pedestrians and vehicles must be interrogated and inspected by the Japanese side. The announcement condemns the British authorities for (1) protecting anti-Japanese and communist elements, (2) supporting the legal tender and hindering the circulation of the puppet Federal Reserve Bank currency, (3) promoting high prices, (4) condoning unregistered radios, and (5) allowing schools in the concession to use anti-Japanese textbooks. The announcement concludes that the above measures taken by the Japanese side will not be revoked until the British authorities completely change their attitude and cooperate with Japan to recognize the new situation in North China and jointly build a new order in East Asia.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Tianjin News, the [Japanese] military and consulate authorities held an emergency meeting at midnight on the 10th. Takeuchi, the economic section chief of the Asia Development Board, came to Tianjin from Beijing to participate in the meeting. It did not end until the morning of the 11th. Decisions were made on financial countermeasures after the blockade of the concession. A spokesperson for the [Japanese] military and the Japanese consul announced on the 12th that the blockade of the concession would begin from that day or the 13th. Foreign commercial organizations with warehouses in the urban area were required to move their inventory into the concession by the 12th, otherwise, the Japanese side would not be responsible for any consequences. The American consul in Tianjin has also been notified that all 450 Americans in Tianjin will still be allowed to import a considerable amount of food after the blockade, and their supplies may even be provided by the Japanese side. This move by the Japanese side is solely to deal with Britain and France. It is also said that special passes will be issued to foreign journalists. It is reported that after learning of the above news, the British Consul-General told foreign reporters that if the Japanese side [words missing, probably 'maintains the blockade'] for more than seven weeks, the British side will take necessary measures to cope with it. Furthermore, there have been no diplomatic negotiations between the [Japanese] side and the British and French concessions since the 12th. News from Tokyo also confirmed that the blockade would take place on the 14th, so mediation efforts have been halted.

[Reuters, London, 13th] This morning, the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee meeting was held at No. 10 Downing Street, chaired by Prime Minister Chamberlain. The serious situation recently occurring in Tianjin was also among the topics discussed.

[Reuters, London, 13th] According to Reuters sources, the British government has suggested to Japan the organization of a "three-person committee," with two members, one British and one Japanese, and a chairman who would be a citizen of a third country. The mission of the committee is to determine whether the Chinese that the Japanese are demanding to extradite from Tianjin have indeed committed criminal acts and whether there is a need for extradition.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 13th] Yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government sent a note to the British Embassy in Chongqing, protesting the transfer of so-called "terrorists" to the Japanese side by the British authorities in the Tianjin British concession. According to the contents of the note, the only authority with the right to decide on extradition is the Chinese government. The British authorities in the Tianjin British concession should not interfere, and the Japanese side has no right to intervene. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has also instructed its ambassador to the UK, Guo Taiqi, to lodge a similar protest with the British Foreign Office.

[Reuters, London, 13th] The Japanese military's blockade of Tianjin has attracted great attention here. At the same time, there have been threats made against the British ambassador. Most newspapers have reported the events of the two incidents with large headlines. The diplomatic correspondent of The Times stated that the Tianjin incident "is the most difficult crisis for Britain since the Sino-Japanese War." Over the past weekend, telegrams were exchanged frequently between the British Foreign Office, the British Ambassador to China, and the Consul-General in Tianjin. The British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, is also assisting in every way, hoping to obtain a compromise solution. However, the Japanese are still insisting on achieving their desired goals and are unwilling to make any concessions. Powerful figures in London are now urging the government to take decisive action to protect British interests in China. Sir Erle Drax, a member of the British House of Lords, has demanded a ban on Japanese ships entering Piraeus and Singapore. Similar demands will be made at the House of Commons meeting tomorrow. Tomorrow, a number of powerful representatives will visit Foreign Secretary Butler, specifically requesting the government to create a consular visa system for goods transported to China and to strengthen the defenses of Shanghai. In recent months, British public opinion has become increasingly tough. Even newspapers that have previously expressed friendliness towards the Japanese have changed their attitude. The British government spokesman often replies to questions from members of Parliament in the House of Commons, saying, "This matter has been raised with Tokyo." Now, this is only enough to provoke the ridicule of the members. Everyone feels that the Japanese military's infringement of British interests is becoming increasingly serious, unless Britain can frankly indicate that it is prepared to retaliate.
