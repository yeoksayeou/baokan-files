The New Fourth Army's Journey in the War of Resistance

The New Fourth Army was established in a very short time, truly emerging from the midst of the War of Resistance, which distinguishes it from other armies. It can be said that the formation and development of our army has gone through four stages up to today.

First Stage: Reorganization. The predecessor of our army was the Red Guerrilla forces and Red Army scattered in the southern provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, etc., which were reorganized. Since the July 7th Incident, the August 13th Incident, and other events, the Red Army and Red Guerrilla forces in various southern provinces, in order to defend the Republic of China and strive for the liberation of the Chinese nation, were reorganized into the New Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army on October 2nd of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), according to a military commission order. In reality, our units began to be reorganized into the New Fourth Army around January of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), and it can be said that the formal process was officially carried out and completed in the 27th year. Although our troops were scattered across seven or eight provinces in the south, covering a vast area and comprising many units, they were able to uniformly complete the reorganization under this order and the decision of the Chinese Communist Party. From January to mid-February of the 27th year was the period of reorganization for our army.

Second Stage: Concentration. One month after the reorganization, under the order of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the New Fourth Army was to concentrate in two areas: north of the Yangtze River towards ××, and south of the Yangtze River towards ××. After February 10th, the second stage began, with the reorganized troops concentrating in the designated areas. First, the First Detachment set off from its various garrisons on February 10th, followed by the Second and Third Detachments in succession. The units north of the Yangtze River also gradually concentrated towards the ×× area. Our military headquarters moved from Nanchang to southern Anhui on April 10th. Although the vast majority of our troops were separated by more than 2,000 li, and most of them marched on foot, they finally completed the concentration on April 10th. After the concentration was completed, the commander-in-chief of the war zone sent personnel to ×× to inspect the concentrated troops. From February 10th to April 10th was the second stage.

Third Stage: Advancement and Deployment of Troops. When our troops had completed concentration, we received another order from the commander-in-chief, instructing us to quickly advance and move to the operational areas for combat. This order, issued on April 15th, tasked us with establishing a guerrilla network in the designated areas, attacking the enemy, disrupting their transportation, and establishing guerrilla base areas in the specified regions.

After our troops completed inspection, they began to advance towards the designated areas and operational areas on April 28th. This was the day our army's advance detachment moved forward. This advance detachment was organized from a portion of our troops south of the Yangtze River, and its mission was to understand and scout the advance routes and combat situations to facilitate the movement of the main forces. After the advance detachment set off, the main forces followed in succession, entering the operational areas south of the Yangtze River along with the advance detachment. At the same time, our headquarters also moved to the southern section in May to command all operations. From April 20th onwards, we were both moving into the operational areas and engaging in combat. This was the third stage of our army's War of Resistance.

Fourth Stage: Combat. After our troops advanced to the operational areas and formally deployed, they officially engaged in combat. (A) First, when the troops north of the Yangtze River arrived at the designated operational area (May 16th), it was when the × people were attacking Hefei, attempting to cross the west bank at the east bank of Chaohu Lake. The first battle of our army began at Jiangjiahekoux. The battle resulted in the complete defeat of the × people at Chaohu. They captured eleven guns and one Japanese flag. This was the first victorious battle of our army north of the Yangtze River. (B) Second, the second battle south of the Yangtze River took place south of Zhenjiang on June 18th, which can also be said to be the first victory south of the Yangtze River. This time, we intercepted cars heading south from Zhenjiang. Except for one that escaped, all were destroyed, and Major Doi of the Japanese army and Captains Umeoka Takeo were killed. More than ten long and short guns and other military supplies were captured, along with more than 7,000 Japanese yuan. This was the first victorious battle south of the Yangtze River. Since May 16th north of the Yangtze River and June 18th south of the Yangtze River, we began to engage in combat. From then on, the most intense battles were fought both north and south of the Yangtze River. This kind of combat was based on the tasks given to us by the commander-in-chief, achieving the completion of the tasks through combat. And these combat tasks were still the tasks of guerrilla warfare. Until the end of September, we received another order from the commander-in-chief instructing our troops to accept the positions of the friendly forces along the Qingyi River. On October 7th, a detachment went to the area along the Qingyi River to take over the positions. This was when our army began to undertake localized positional warfare. In this stage, most of the fighting was guerrilla warfare, and a small part was positional warfare. In terms of the army's firepower, our army's firepower was very weak, and without strong firepower, it was impossible to undertake positional warfare. However, for the needs of the War of Resistance, and to facilitate the operations of friendly forces on the same front, we had to reluctantly accept this task and complete it. Some people say that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army do not fight positional warfare, and that they refuse positional warfare. Those who say these things do not understand or misunderstand the situation. We can say that our firepower is worse than that of any other army. An army with weak firepower cannot undertake positional warfare and cannot complete positional warfare tasks. But for the sake of the War of Resistance, as long as it is beneficial to the War of Resistance, even at the cost of greater sacrifices, we must accept this task and strive to complete it.

This explains the four stages of our army's War of Resistance: the first stage, reorganization; the second stage, concentration; the third stage, advancement and deployment; and the fourth stage, combat. These four stages are what our army experienced in the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938).

An Overview of the New Fourth Army's Operational Journey and Combat Achievements

An overview of our army's operational journey and combat achievements: this is to say, what was the journey of our fighting in the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938) and the battles fought?

First, our operations can be divided into two stages. In terms of time, although the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938) was a full year, in the twelve months, because we had to reorganize, concentrate, advance, and deploy, the actual time spent in combat was only seven and a half months north of the Yangtze River and six and a half months south of the Yangtze River. In this period of just over half a year, our operational journey can be roughly divided into two stages.

A is our offensive, our active offensive. In this stage of active offense, it can be further divided into two parts: first, the situation south of the Yangtze River was very chaotic before our troops entered the area. In particular, many guerrilla units with poor discipline not only failed to carry out the task of resisting Japan and coordinating with the national war effort in various areas, but on the contrary, hindered the development of the War of Resistance in this area, helping Japanese imperialism facilitate their transportation and maintain their rule. Therefore, the first task of our army was to remove the obstacles to our ability to directly attack Japanese ××ism, and to disband or reorganize the guerrilla units that hindered the people's resistance against Japan. After we arrived in this area, we first disarmed guerrilla commanders such as Zhu Yongxiang and Chen Degong, etc., who were known as "little Japanese" by the people south of the Yangtze River, and some were transferred back to the rear for reorganization. Because the removal of these obstacles was of great benefit to the operations south of the Yangtze River. At the same time, when we entered the operational area, because there was no formal Chinese army insisting on fighting in this area, and instead there were some bad guerrilla units, this led to the development of puppet regimes south of the Yangtze River. It can be said that, except for places where the power of Japanese ××ists could not reach, puppet regimes were generally established. Precisely because the development of puppet maintenance societies hindered the unfolding of the anti-Japanese situation among the people south of the Yangtze River and the raising of the anti-Japanese sentiments of the broad masses, clearing out these maintenance societies and puppet regimes was a necessary task. Only in this way could the people south of the Yangtze River be mobilized from their depressed mood and obstacles to actively participate in the War of Resistance, and to develop the anti-Japanese situation south of the Yangtze River. This is the first part of the first stage.

The second part is a comprehensive offensive against the Japanese ×. Subsequently, when Xuzhou fell and the × people actively attacked Wuhan, we used our greatest efforts to fight fiercely on the battlefield south of the Yangtze River to carry out the battle to defend Wuhan, and to coordinate with the friendly forces around Wuhan to achieve the task of defending Wuhan. The offensive at this time can be divided into two aspects: one towards both sides of the Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway, and the other towards the Jingwu (Nanjing-Wuhu) Railway. This is the railway aspect. On the highway, towards the area between the Jinghang (Nanjing-Hangzhou) National Highway and the Jinghuhang (Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou) National Highway. From June 18th in the Yangtze River area, many battles, large and small, were fought, such as the battles of Weigang, Zhuzilin, Xinfeng, Xiafeng, Xintang, Shidong, and Xixiecun, the battle of Qilinmen in Nanjing, the attack on Sijing, the attack on Jurong, and the attack on Jiangning Station. These battles, large and small, were all part of the first stage of our operations, in which we adopted a resolute offensive against the × people, starting to coordinate with the defense of Xuzhou and continuing to coordinate with the defense of Great Wuhan. From June 18th to the beginning of September was our stage of active offensive, of resolute offensive.

B The second stage was due to our offensive, which forced the × people to adopt an offensive defense. They had to launch a counteroffensive against our offensive. From September 15th, the × people began a five-pronged attack on Baoyan, an area between Zhenjiang and Danyang. Later, the × people abandoned Yicheng and Piaoyang and other places, concentrating their forces to bypass the Jinghu line, and began their offensive against us. Why did the × people launch a counteroffensive? We say there are three reasons: (1) Because after our army arrived in the area south of the Yangtze River, our active offensive over three months threatened Nanjing and Zhenjiang, the strategic points and hubs for the × people's operations in the south. The Jinghu line was the lifeline of transportation, and the Jinghu and Jingwu lines were greatly disrupted by our sabotage and attacks. Frequently, our people went to Nanjing City to harass them. This threatened the Japanese ×, and to eliminate these threats, they had to counterattack us. (2) In the battlefield south of the Yangtze River, the task we undertook was only a quarter of the guerrilla area. On the one hand, it was due to the active nature of our offensive. On the other hand, because three-quarters of the area had no combat or no active combat, and the quarter of the area where we were fighting happened to be an important area for the × people strategically and for the transfer of their forces, the × people had to withdraw troops from other areas and use their main force to deal with us, to reduce their threat. Therefore, the Japanese troops in Xuancheng, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places moved in large numbers towards Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Wuhu.

(3) The × people's attack on Wuhan mainly relied on the coordination of the navy, the air force, and the army, not entirely on the army, but on the navy covering the army's advance towards Wuhan. Then, the Yangtze River line was its transportation line for advancement. Therefore, in order to facilitate supplying the front and transporting troops, the Japanese bandits had to remove the threat to the Yangtze River traffic, and they had to launch a counteroffensive. This is to say that in the second stage, due to our offensive, the × people launched a counteroffensive, and there were these three reasons.

But this counteroffensive of the × people was a defensive counteroffensive. They used the counteroffensive to achieve their defensive purpose, wanting to drive out all our troops on the Jinghu and Jinghang lines and around Nanjing to ensure their safety. Therefore, the offensive was not large-scale, and the offensive on the battle line, such as the offensive in southern Anhui, was also a kind of defensive offensive. The main purpose was to maintain the Yangtze River traffic, because the Yangtze River traffic relied on ships. We had previously organized many mobile ship groups, which made their transportation difficult, forcing them to use the army south of the Yangtze River to maintain their traffic. From the whole point of view, the × people's counteroffensive was still a defensive offensive, and we must be clear about this point.

Where do we see the × people's offensive? From the perspective of the overall situation of the war south of the Yangtze River, the × people now have three centers of offensive: in southern Anhui, with Qingyang as the center; in the south of the Yangtze River, one with Maoshan as the center, and one with Xiaodanyang between Nanjing and Danyang as the center. These three centers can also be said to be the strongholds of our army's operations and the base points for operations with friendly forces.

In southern Anhui, from September to December, the × people successively occupied Guichi, Tongling, Fanchang, and recently attacked Qingyang. In the south of the Yangtze River, the × people launched a five-pronged attack on Baoyan on September 10th, a three-pronged attack on Jiangyeqiao on the 12th, and a two-pronged attack on the 15th, one attacking Shangxingbu and the other attacking Shangpei and Lishui. On October 7th, they launched another two-pronged attack, one attacking Xinwangzhuang and the other attacking Beizhen, setting fire to Maoshan. On October 24th, they launched a five-pronged attack on the area north of Jurong. On November 10th, × attacked Jiangyeqiao again. On November 30th, they launched a five-pronged attack on Yanling. From September onwards, the × people constantly attacked our base points. At the end of September, Yanling, Huangchi, Wuxi, and Qingxiaozhen. After October 12th, the × people launched a four-pronged attack on Xiaodanyang. On December 13th, they attacked Huoli, and recently on December 21st, they attacked Zhumen. On October 17th, the × people launched a two-pronged attack on Hongxi Town. On November 30th, they launched a three-pronged attack with great force on Guyi River and other places. In southern Anhui, with Qingyang as the center, and in the south of the Yangtze River, with Maoshan and Xiaodanyang as the centers, the × people's offensive mainly wanted to prevent us from gaining a foothold in these places, forcing us to leave this area, because these three places are all our strategic strongholds. This way, they could achieve the elimination of threats and the safety of transportation.

In summary, the operations in the south of the Yangtze River from June 18th to December 31st can be divided into two stages: the first stage was our period of offensive, and the second stage was because of our army's offensive, the × people had to adopt a defensive offensive, creating the formation of the × people's counteroffensive.

Second, how many battles did we fight in total since the start of the operations south of the Yangtze River? In summary, during this period of six and a half to seven months, we fought a total of 234 battles both north and south of the Yangtze River. Among these 234 battles, 200 battles were fought south of the Yangtze River. It can be said that our battles were mainly fought south of the Yangtze River.

Third, what did we gain from our battles? I would like to make a list of it. In the 234 battles, we captured 1,539 rifles and carbines, 32 light machine guns, 4 heavy machine guns, 48 Mauser pistols, and 20 pistols. The amount of Japanese money was approximately 22,738 yuan. The number of documents, coats, flags, and other military supplies is too numerous to list (statistical table omitted). In addition to these spoils of war captured in battle, we also destroyed 195 Japanese × cars and damaged 95 bridges. There is a separate statistic for damage to highways and railways. (statistical table omitted). During this period of six and a half to seven months, what was the ratio of casualties between the × and us? During this period, our army suffered a total of 664 casualties, while the × people suffered 3,232 casualties. From the perspective of the comparison between the × and us, it is a ratio of one to four and seven-tenths. It can also be said that one of us is equal to four and a half of them, which is the most cost-effective in the War of Resistance. In the past, in the War of Resistance of our army, in the positions, the ratio of casualties between the × and us was that we suffered three to five casualties for every one casualty of the × people. In the second and third phases, it was reduced to a ratio of two and five-tenths to one. Guerrilla warfare is the exact opposite. We suffer one casualty, and the × people will suffer four and a half casualties. Accumulating small victories becomes a large number. In this experience of six and a half to seven months, it can be fully seen that guerrilla warfare in the Chinese War of Resistance is beneficial to us.

Changes in the War Situation South of the Yangtze River and Its Development Trends

First, changes in the × situation. We can talk about this from two aspects: one is military changes, and the other is political changes.

A. Military changes can also be divided into two stages: First, the situation in the war zone south of the Yangtze River before June. Before June, the Japanese × military was centered on Nanjing, with Wuhu and Zhenjiang as strongholds, two strategic base points, and two strategic forward positions. The Japanese × forces were concentrated in these three strongholds, but the forces in each stronghold were not large. On the transportation lines of the Jinghu, Jingwu, and Jinghang National Highways, as well as the county towns or large cities and towns on both sides of the transportation lines, only a small number of troops were stationed to maintain their transportation. Before June, the Japanese × transportation could proceed smoothly without any severe blows or obstacles. The Japanese × could control and rule everything with a small number of troops, and even groups of three to five could go to the villages near the transportation lines to rape and plunder, and rarely be attacked. This is to say that before June, the Japanese × rear transportation was very safe. The total force in the three transportation strongholds, from Changchuan, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Dangtu to Wuhu, was only regularly stationed with more than two regiments. The other strongholds had no more than two platoons or one squad. Because the rear transportation was very safe, the Japanese × could withdraw most of their forces into the northern war zone, concentrating on the Huaihe and Jinpu areas, attacking Hefei and Xuzhou. This was the situation before June, but since our army entered the operational area, due to our active offensive and constant attacks, the Japanese × transportation suffered frequent stagnation, obstacles, and threats. To protect their military strongholds and strategic hubs, the Japanese × had to counterattack us. Currently, the Japanese × troop deployment is different from before. Second, the current military deployment of the × people. Currently, the Japanese × forces are scattered and concentrated in two areas, one centered on Nanjing and the other based on Wuhu. On the Japanese × transportation lines, it can be said that every major transportation route, such as every bridge, station, and corner of the highway on the Jinghu line, has a stronghold built and troops stationed. Each stronghold, not to mention large cities and small strongholds, also concentrates considerable forces to guard. Every small place has fortifications built for cover. We are moving back and forth between the Japanese × strongholds. Now the Japanese × movement or transportation must be protected by forces, and they no longer dare to go to the countryside easily with a small number of people. In total, there are two and a half to three divisions of Japanese × south of the Yangtze River, with one division centered on Wuhu, one division centered on Nanjing, and one brigade centered on Zhenjiang. In addition, more than 5,000 puppet troops have been added from North China and Manchuria. The Japanese × deployment is more strict. This is a major change in the Japanese × military deployment, and it is the result of our arrival in the area south of the Yangtze River.

B. Political trends, the political trends of the × people can also be divided into three periods: The first period is before June. 1. The burning, killing, and plundering by the Japanese army in the area south of the Yangtze River is a common phenomenon, using power to suppress the Chinese people and make them submit. 2. The guerrilla units have very poor discipline, and Japan uses this phenomenon to incite the people's feelings against the guerrilla units. They say that it is the guerrilla units that are disrupting peace and security, and that the Imperial Army is fighting the guerrilla units, using these facts to bewilder the Chinese people, which has had considerable effect. 3. It is to use two-faced people to establish its rule. The two-faced people are: when the Japanese army comes, they set off firecrackers to welcome them, and get some women to comfort the Imperial Army. They also set off firecrackers for the Chinese army. These two-faced people preside over everything, and

mutually do not offend each other, attempting to survive by compromising. 4. It is that the guerrilla units and the Japanese × have a tacit understanding and do not fight each other. This phenomenon was very common south of the Yangtze River in the past, and it still exists in the eastern section of the Jinghu line. 5. Such as Japan using the fact that after the Chinese army withdrew from Nanjing, there was no army to stay and fight in the south of the Yangtze River, so there was no propaganda work, and Japan could carry out arbitrary propaganda in China, and also use traitors to announce

news of the war. This naturally dampened the anti-Japanese sentiments of the people south of the Yangtze River. This is the first period of Japan's political actions.

The second period, after our army entered, Japanese imperialism engaged in large-scale activities. 1. Everywhere, they used airplanes to distribute leaflets, saying that the Red Army's fight against local tyrants was communism, attempting to create class conflicts and prevent the masses from contacting us, and to destroy our unity. However, since our army entered this area, we used our actions and our battles to prove that our army has good discipline and protects the interests of the people, causing the propaganda of the Japanese × to lose its effect. Secondly, they use power to suppress the common people to prevent them from approaching us. Otherwise, they use cannons to bombard indiscriminately and burn houses, causing the people to call for the New Fourth Army not to come, so as to avoid burning houses. But later, the places we did not go to were still the same in burning and killing, and the people gradually felt that the propaganda of the Japanese × was deceiving them. 3. Political propaganda. The × people used the pretext of anti-communism and anti-Chiang to say to the people that you are suffering from the disasters of war because of the Communist Party and Chiang Kai-shek, and that you can only achieve peace by opposing the Communist Party and opposing Chiang Kai-shek. The central slogan of the × people is to oppose the main force of the Chinese War of Resistance. This is to say that after our army entered, their previous methods were useless. 4. Adopt a gentle policy. The × people have also restrained their most barbaric actions and given a little favor to prevent the people from approaching us.

The third period, that is, the most recent trends. 1. Subdue local armed forces with insufficient awareness, bad elements, and wavering loyalties to become traitors. 2. Threaten two-faced people to stand on their side and become loyal tools of their rule. 3. Use traitors to divide everywhere. 4. Collude with local wavering elements, not only communicating information to them, but also belonging to their sphere of influence. 5. For armies that actively attack, they have a tacit understanding and adopt a non-aggression attitude. 6. Promote the anti-communist movement, such as the anti-communist movement rallies recently held in Nanjing and Wuhu. 7. The × people have recently used Chinese resources to make various factories start production. In Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, and other places, Japanese people have come forward to open factories, allowing those capitalists with weak national consciousness to open factories and do business, seeking economic cooperation with Japan. The dumping of Japanese goods is being implemented in these places. In this way, on the one hand, they are developing Chinese resources, and on the other hand, they are using Chinese resources to carry out the Sino-Japanese War. The × people are politically advancing in this direction. Over the past year, the × people have had different military and political developments, and have had changes.

Second, the changes in our military and political situation: (1) Before June, puppet organizations and maintenance societies were universally present in the area south of the Yangtze River, and there was very little Chinese power. 2. Two-faced people filled various places, occupying the main position. 3. The people south of the Yangtze River were emotionally depressed. 4. Since the War of Resistance, bandits have been common and rampant everywhere. 5. The Big Sword Society, due to the suppression by the Japanese and the tyranny of the guerrillas, has created a kind of obstacle. 6. The guerrilla units have very poor discipline, desperately fighting among themselves and competing for territory. Precisely because they are fighting among themselves, they have no strength to fight the Japanese. This is the situation before June. (2) After our army entered, the results of several months of fighting and work are: 1. Except for within the Japanese × strongholds, the puppet regimes have been universally abolished, and Chinese power has been universally established and restored. 2. Two-faced people have disappeared. 3. Bad armed forces have either been disbanded or reorganized. 4. Strive for the Big Sword Society to cooperate in operations. 5. People's organizations, generally speaking, have been fairly well established. 6. The anti-Japanese sentiments of the people have been greatly raised. These are the changes since our army entered the area south of the Yangtze River. (3) The future trend is that the war situation in the south of the Yangtze River is becoming increasingly tense, and the struggle is becoming increasingly sharp. We estimate that the situation in the south of the Yangtze River in the future will have a deeper development. Under the circumstances of more intense and more arduous struggles, if there is no development of broad mass organizations, the partial division of a few wavering elements is inevitable. Not only must the military and the people cooperate, but the military and the government must be unified. This is necessary to adapt to the more difficult situation south of the Yangtze River in the future. However, in the current situation, the military and the government are still separated and are running in opposite directions. This is not in line with future developments and should be urgently corrected. (To be continued)

### The English People's Ardent Hopes for the British Government

Sir George Paish, a renowned British economist, made a special trip around the world to understand the economic situation in various regions. Yesterday, upon arriving in Hong Kong, he delivered a speech brimming with insights, fully expressing how the British people hold different and ardent hopes for their government. He began by stating, "Previously, Britain thought that if dictators could be dealt with in a reasonable manner, they would become rational. However, it is now clear that this is not the case." Indeed, arrogant aggressors cannot be reasoned with; only a firm stance and concrete measures can prevent their unreasonable disturbances. George Paish correctly pointed out the British government's responsibility for the current situation, saying, "The majority of the British public has long believed that a firm policy should be adopted. It is the government, not the people, who are timid." The British government's past concessions to aggressors, which have led to the current unmanageable situation in Europe, are all revealed in these few words. One can imagine how fervently the British people expect their government to act.

We believe that the British government's past adoption of appeasement policies towards aggressors was not without reason. In a nutshell, it was out of fear of war and a desire for baseless peace. In fact, the result of loving peace and making concessions to aggressors is, as George Paish pointed out, "Each time we yield to a dictator, we move closer to war. I believe that the crisis of war is now approaching. If such steps—referring to sanctions against dictators—were implemented sooner, the war would not be as imminent as it is today... Now that Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union are no longer yielding to dictators, I do not believe that war will occur in the near future." We have repeatedly elaborated on this principle in our articles. The British government should carefully consider these words now that the European crisis is quite profound.

Currently, all countries in the world recognize that "the situation is extremely serious." European observers speculate that Germany and Italy may continue to expand their influence. Italy has already mobilized some reservists, and the army's manpower is now over one million. Germany has also partially mobilized, and troops in Berlin are extremely busy. There is even talk of Italy sending troops to land in Spain. In Eastern Europe, Hungary is preparing to advance on Romania and Yugoslavia, and the Nazi Party in the Free City of Danzig is also preparing to declare the city's annexation into Germany in the near future, further complicating the major disputes. It is heard that Germany has already made harsh demands to Poland! (1) Transfer Danzig to Germany; (2) Allow Germany to build a highway across the Polish Corridor to connect Germany and East Prussia; (3) Cede the Polish territories in eastern Silesia and Upper Silesia; (4) Guarantee autonomy for the German minority in other areas. Large units of the German army have concentrated on the German-Polish border. This is tantamount to threatening Poland into concluding a treaty of surrender.

Most of the small countries in Eastern Europe are guaranteed by Britain. Germany and Italy's threat to these small countries also threatens Britain. Britain's attitude is indeed worthy of attention. Whether Britain can take appropriate measures will determine whether Germany and Italy's reckless actions can be temporarily halted. Britain is still conducting negotiations on guarantees to Greece and Turkey, hoping to win the position of leader in Eastern Europe. Whether Britain can achieve this goal will be determined by whether it can fulfill its guarantees to Poland. Britain is now in an increasingly important position. On the one hand, not only are the small countries of Eastern Europe vying for its protection, but France is also following Britain, expressing a very firm stance. Daladier's declaration has been published simultaneously with Chamberlain's declaration, stating that "any further acts of aggression by totalitarian states, whether against Romania, Poland, Greece, or Turkey, will draw Britain and France into the vortex of war." On the other hand, the United States is gradually actively assisting the Soviet Union in order to curb the recklessness of aggressors in the East and reduce their constraints on Britain and France in the East.

In today's situation, the British government should follow the will of the people and actively adopt a firm stance in Europe to deal with the two fierce powers of Germany and Italy. In the Far East, in addition to taking active action itself, it must also further help China resist the war and genuinely link up with the United States and the Soviet Union. Today, the leader of the British Liberal Party, Lloyd George, openly criticized Chamberlain for not over-believing dictators and urged Chamberlain to promptly establish a concrete military understanding with the Soviet Union. The alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union should emphasize practicality and sincerity. The incomparably solid military port of Singapore should be provided for use by the United States and other countries in the future, and there should be specific provisions for various supplies to the Soviet Union. The British and French governments have now issued a final warning to German and Italian aggressors. The British people must be expecting the British government to firmly uphold its position to the end.

### Our Counter-Offensive Makes Good Progress, All Battlefields Dominated, Intense Fighting in Jiangxi, Victories in Hubei and Henan, Advancing on Zengcheng and Guangzhou in Southern Guangdong

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 14th] The morale of the enemy troops on all battlefields is declining, and our situation is improving. The battle in Jiangxi is at a stalemate. Our troops are still holding out against the enemy about 20 kilometers south of Nanchang, and 15 to 25 kilometers west of Gao'an, as well as in various places northwest of Wuning. The fighting is still fierce.

[Central News Agency, Zhangshu, 14th] On the morning of the 12th, a unit of our army searched and advanced towards the area of Lingqian Chen, northwest of Gao'an, and encountered more than 300 enemy infantry and cavalry, leading to an engagement. Many enemies were killed. As of the afternoon of that day, the fighting was still intense.

[Central News Agency, Zhangshu, 14th] On the evening of the 12th, our army dispatched a team to launch a fierce attack on the enemy's Shuikougang area, east of Huibu, near Gao'an, killing more than ten enemies and seizing many flags and documents.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 14th] In central Hubei, our counter-offensive continues to make progress. One route in Suizhou has approached Xihe. The enemy in Zhongxiang is still surrounded by us.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 14th] In southern Henan, a fresh force of our army attacked Xinyang again on the 12th. That night, two enemy units, each with more than 200 men, were completely annihilated west of the city, and many weapons were captured.

[Central News Agency, Nanyang, 13th] Tongbai telegraphed this morning that the enemy who invaded west of Xinyang, seeing that our army and people were prepared, did not dare to attack. 600 to 700 enemy troops moved from Guangshui to Xinyang. A unit of our army pressed towards the enemy and stationed in the area of Jiehe Xindian Huashan. The enemy, unable to withstand the pressure, withdrew to the Liangtongshan Youhe area. The enemy at Changtaiguan shelled us, showing signs of invading northward. Yesterday morning, a small number of enemy traces were also found in Zhujiapu and Shijiapu.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 14th] In southern Guangdong, we are still attacking Zengcheng and the suburbs of Guangzhou.

Results of the Counter-Offensive on Kaifeng: Our Army Has Achieved Significant Results

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 14th] After our army re-entered Kaifeng, it was ultimately restrained by enemy reinforcements coming from the east, and the enemy east of Bian actively mobilized for a counter-offensive. Our army, having achieved its goal of a surprise attack, voluntarily gave up the city. By 1:00 PM, the enemy in Bian, under the cover of five aircraft, launched an attack on us. Our army ambushed a battalion on the southern embankment, luring the enemy closer and then launching a sudden counterattack. The enemy was caught off guard and suffered another 600 to 700 casualties, with only 200 to 300 escaping. On the 12th, the enemy was dealt a heavy blow twice in one day.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] A foreign dispatch from Shanghai on the 14th reported that when reporters inquired with the Japanese spokesperson about the situation of the Chinese army's counter-offensive on Kaifeng, it was claimed that he had not heard of it. A military observer from a neutral country said that although the Chinese army's counter-offensive on Kaifeng was not of great military value, its impact was extremely significant from a political and psychological point of view. This was because it was the first effective attack by the Chinese army on an important city occupied by the Japanese army. In addition, Kaifeng was the location of the General Headquarters of General Wu Peifu, which was built by the Japanese army. The counter-offensive was carried out, but the Japanese claimed that the Chinese army's counter-offensive had failed. Therefore, in terms of strategy, the Chinese army had indeed achieved success. However, Kaifeng is an important base for the Japanese army, and the Japanese army will definitely send heavy troops to guard it.

[Reuters, Peiping, 14th] According to Japanese official sources received here yesterday, the fighting in Kaifeng, after the Chinese army reinforcements arrived, was still in full swing yesterday morning. The Chinese army was well-equipped and launched fierce attacks in the suburbs. It was claimed that the fighting had entered its fourth day and was becoming increasingly fierce. Japanese sources admitted that the Chinese army attacking Kaifeng had surrounded the puppet military police south of the city station and occupied the airport.

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 13th] The various units of our army counter-attacking southern Shanxi have been fighting with the enemy for various strongholds for days, and the fighting is extremely fierce.

After four hours of intense fighting, more than 50 enemies were killed. The enemy, unable to withstand the pressure, fled back to Zhangdian. At midnight on the 12th, our army took advantage of the night to attack Zhangdian, advanced to the west of Gucheng, approached Zhangdian, and immediately engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. The fighting became even more intense after dawn. The enemy retaliated with intense artillery fire, bombarding us. As of the afternoon, the fighting was still in full swing.

In this battle, more than 100 enemies were killed, and we suffered more than 50 casualties.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 13th] On the morning of the 12th, a unit of our army launched a fierce attack on the enemy in Xiaxian, breaking into the South Pass of the county seat and is now engaged in street fighting with the enemy. More than 300 enemy infantry and cavalry from Yuxiang encountered our guerrillas in the area of Caoping, west of the county, at the same time. After several hours of intense fighting, the enemy, unable to withstand the pressure, fled back to the county seat.

### Full-Scale Counter-Offensive in Northwestern Shanxi

On the 9th, the enemy captured Lewuwu Village and Shangbeige Village west of the city. County Magistrate Zeng led his troops to resist, but was unable to withstand the enemy and was captured. The village was also completely burned down.

### Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Kuomintang Swears Oath

[Minkuo News Agency, Xingji, 14th] All executive members of the Shanxi Provincial Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang took office on January 1st of this year, but had not sworn an oath. It is now heard that nine executive members, Qiu Yangjun, Wang Fang, Bo Yuxiang, Liu Guan, Li Jiang, Liu Dianji, Wang Yanming, Li Youlong, and Wu Shipeng, held an oath ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 11th of this month at the current Xing Magistrate's office. Zhao Daiwen, the chairman dispatched by the Central Committee, served as the oath supervisor and performed the ceremony in accordance with regulations. Each executive member then read the oath, followed by Chairman Zhao's exhortation, which stated that all comrades, in taking this oath, should believe firmly in the spirit of the Premier, be aboveboard, and be determined to serve the compatriots of the whole country. Based on this oath, they should be eternally unswerving. As for the comrades going to work in the war zone, they should earnestly lead and assist the public affairs and the Sacrifice League to increase the strength of resistance. Then, Committee Member Qiu Yangjun gave a reply, and the ceremony concluded.

### Sabotaging International Civil Aviation: It Is Said the Enemy Again Attacks Eurasia Aircraft, Philippine Clipper Detours to Hong Kong

[This Port's News] The Japanese are extremely jealous of the development of our country's civil aviation industry and have repeatedly tried to sabotage it, but all attempts have failed. Therefore, they have shifted their anger to civil aviation aircraft of third countries related to us. After the Guilin aircraft was attacked, the Eurasia aircraft was chased by Japanese aircraft twice. In addition, the Eurasia aircraft on the Yunnan-Vietnam line was recently shot down by Japanese aircraft in French territory. According to Chongqing news, "On the 13th, an Eurasia aircraft flying from Chongqing to Hanoi was besieged by three Japanese aircraft near Lao Cai on the Yunnan-Vietnam border. The Eurasia aircraft was eventually shot down, and the German driver was slightly injured. Whether the other passengers were injured is currently unknown." The Japanese side's disregard for the interests of third countries is undeniably obvious. It is also noted that the Japanese Navy recently issued a false declaration, warning all national civil aviation aircraft not to fly over its warships, otherwise they will definitely fire upon them. Therefore, the Pan American Philippine Clipper, which arrived in Hong Kong at 2:00 PM yesterday, saw several Japanese warships patrolling while flying from the Philippines to Hong Kong. Fearing that it would be attacked, it detoured to Macau and then flew to Hong Kong.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 14th] Eurasia Airlines flight number 19 from Yuhhe took off from Hanoi at 2:00 PM on the 13th. While flying to the airspace near Lao Cai on the Yunnan-Vietnam border, it encountered three Japanese aircraft chasing it and was forced to land. One German pilot was injured, and the details of the passengers are being investigated. It is heard that after learning of the incident, Eurasia Airlines immediately dispatched aircraft to the vicinity of Lao Cai to try to rescue them. It is noted that there were air raid alerts in various parts of Yunnan on the afternoon of the 13th, and the encountered aircraft may have been Japanese aircraft attacking Yunnan.

### Great Victory in the Occupied Areas of North China: The Enemy's Plan to Sweep Through Southern Shandong Is Shattered by Us, The Bloody Battle of Jianggu Creates Supreme Glory

[Special Chongqing Air Mail News] Shandong News: The enemy in Shandong Province has recently continued to launch large-scale attacks on us. On the morning of the 29th of last month, the enemy in Lin* divided into three routes: one route of more than 200 puppet troops invaded west, reaching Zhifang in the evening; one route of more than 200 puppet troops invaded south, reaching Qingyaitou on the north bank of the Mihe River. These two units were meant to contain our forces on the flanks. Another 400 Japanese infantry, more than 100 cavalry, more than 200 puppet troops, eight artillery pieces, twenty machine guns, and 500 carts advanced along the Yi-Lin Highway, crossing the Mihe River. They were ambushed by a unit of our army. At 4:00 PM, they reached Xinzai, 30 miles north of Jianggu. On the morning of the 30th, our army lured the enemy to the Heigua Xiagu area southwest of Xinzai, and after two hours of intense fighting, more than 50 enemies were killed. At 10:00 AM, the enemy reached Zhaolingzi, north of Jianggu, and engaged in fierce fighting with a platoon of our advanced troops, killing many enemies. Later, our troops used the terrain to hide, and the enemy fired dozens of artillery shells, but we did not move. When the enemy approached, we swept them with machine guns, killing more than 50 enemies. The enemy retreated to Changzhuang. After reorganizing, they launched a concentrated artillery counter-attack on us and surrounded us from both flanks. The platoon stood firm and did not retreat, killing dozens more enemies. We also bravely sacrificed 25 soldiers. On the 30th, the enemy gathered in Jianggu, attempting to invade south the next morning. Jianggu is divided into East Valley and West Valley, both with walls. At that time, there were about 600 enemies in East Valley and about 200 in West Valley. Our army attacked both valleys simultaneously at dawn. At 5:00 AM, both valleys were captured by us at the same time. A battalion commander of our army directed the battle with his chest bared, moving back and forth in East Valley three times. One of our soldiers killed seven or eight enemy soldiers with his bare hands. Later, more than 40 enemies were found in a courtyard. Two squads of our soldiers threw grenades fiercely, killing all the enemies in the courtyard. Later, enemy reinforcements came from other places, and the two squads of our soldiers were all sacrificed. Another squad of ours killed more than 30 enemies outside the East Gate and was later surrounded and sacrificed. Our platoon leader, Ma Wenyuan, waved his knife and killed nine enemy soldiers in a row. Mr. Ma was also injured in seven places. Our company commander, Wang Haichao, after his entire company was sacrificed, still held a machine gun and killed many enemies, and finally made a heroic sacrifice. The fighting in West Valley was intense, no less than in East Valley. After the entire company of our Deputy Yang Dengfu was sacrificed, he led hundreds of guards and hacked several enemy machine gunners to death. After suffering serious injuries, he continued to kill many more enemies and finally died for the country. Geng Jiqing, the commander of our machine gun company, with a squad guarding a high ground southwest of West Valley, when the enemy detoured from the Shahe, more than 40 enemies were killed. The squad continued to advance to the outside of the West Gate. The machine gun encountered obstacles and was surrounded by the enemy. The whole squad was sacrificed. The company commander picked up a gun to repair it in the trench and was also discovered and killed by the enemy. In this battle, our army fought fiercely with the enemy from morning to noon, six hours of intense fighting, killing more than 500 enemies in total. We bravely sacrificed 18 company and platoon leaders and more than 300 soldiers. This move completely shattered the enemy's plan to sweep through southern, dealt a great blow to them, and was the greatest victory in the occupied areas recently. The local people welcomed us with food and drink, and when they talked about the heroic resistance of our army, they were moved to tears. (He Bingru, 10th)

### Japan's Control Over Northwest Fur Trade in Baotou

(1) Japan's Consistent Policy of Aggression Against China

(Yu Lin Correspondence) As we all know, Japan's policy of aggression against China has consistently focused on political and economic goals, with economic aggression as its foundation. This is the essence of Japanese imperialism. Since the "July 7th" Incident, Japan has launched fierce attacks on the Chinese mainland with superior weapons, while simultaneously intensifying the central work of its economic conspiracy, organizing the China Economic Affairs Bureau to control two companies: (1) North China Development Company and (2) Central China Promotion Company. These companies specialize in undermining the legal tender, seizing cash, opening up markets, and exploiting military resources.

(2) Japanese Establish Fur Trading Bureau in Baotou

Recently, a businessman from Baotou mentioned that the pseudo-North China Development Company has established a fur trading bureau in Baotou to control the fur trade in Northwest China.

Mr. [Name Hidden] was a member of the chamber of commerce before Baotou fell. He knows the trade situation in Baotou very well. After Baotou fell, he witnessed the brutality of the Japanese and was in constant danger of being harmed. He fled to [Place Hidden] last year and recently arrived in Yulin. He said that Baotou is the general sales center for furs from Gansu, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Suiyuan, and Mongolia. A large amount of fur from the Northwest accumulates here and is transported to Tianjin via the PingSui Railway. The annual export of sheep wool and cashmere alone exceeds 30 million catties. Before the Lugouqiao Incident, fur prices in Baotou soared, with sheep wool reaching 100 yuan per 100 catties and sheep reaching 300-400 yuan per 100 catties. After the fall of Beijing and Tianjin and the control of transportation lines by the Japanese, exports were affected, and fur prices plummeted, causing great hardship for fur merchants. The pseudo-fur trading bureau forced registration, prohibiting the removal of fur stored in various fur warehouses and by fur merchants. They used fake currency to buy sheep wool, setting the price at 70 yuan per 100 catties, and cashmere at 200 yuan per 100 catties (various other wool types also had fixed prices). They have already transported all the fur accumulated in Baotou over the years, but the new cashmere produced in the 27th year was not delivered in full. The Japanese then used incentives, rewarding fur warehouses with the largest deliveries to promote external propaganda and widely attract fur sources. They also posted slogans on the city walls, such as "Welcome Mongolian Nationals to Trade and Protect Fur Merchants." They have now slightly increased the fur prices to actively achieve control.

(3) Our Losses are Staggering

Over the past year, the total value of fur transported from Baotou has been approximately 20 million yuan or more. Due to the impact of the war, fur prices in the production areas of Ningxia and Shaanxi are extremely low. Some unscrupulous merchants seized the opportunity to make a fortune, transporting cashmere to Baotou to sell to the Japanese and exchanging it for Japanese goods to sell in the rear, earning considerable profits. Most of these traders are from Ningxia and northern Shaanxi, transporting goods through Mongolia. This phenomenon, although caused by the ignorance of merchants, is also due to the lax blockade of the river crossings.

(4) Hope that the Central Government Establishes Fur Exchanges in Ningxia, Gansu, Xia, and Yulin

I previously read an article in the 15th issue of "Northwest Forum," titled "Resisting Japanese Purchases of Fur from Suiyuan, Mongolia, Ningxia, and Shaanxi Border Areas," which suggested that the Central Government should establish trade sub-bureaus in Yulin to specialize in purchasing fur from the Northwest. This has not yet been implemented. Now, we still hope that the authorities will petition the Central Government to quickly establish trade sub-bureaus in Ningxia and Yulin, establish fur factories, and improve production. This is the only effective way to resist. (Civil Revolutionary Society)

### Shanghai Circles Express Solemn Opposition to Peace Conspiracy; General Mobilization Meeting Encourages Compatriots to Implement Six Matters to Complete the Great Task of Resistance

[Shanghai Correspondence] The Shanghai All-Circles National Spiritual Mobilization Association was officially established on March 22nd of this year. Organizational structures are being actively established in various sectors. The Labor Sector National Spiritual Mobilization Association has also been established, and organizations in the morning, business, professional, and cultural sectors will also be established within days. The Shanghai All-Circles National Spiritual Mobilization Association has recently issued a letter to compatriots, encouraging all citizens to strive for six things. Here is a direct transcription:

Beloved Compatriots of the City, after our Supreme Leader Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the entire country to announce the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, compatriots across the country unanimously accepted this great enlightenment from the Supreme Leader. The citizens of this city are even more exceptionally excited, and everyone deeply believes that in this later stage of the war of resistance, the importance of spirit is even greater than that of material. To unleash the power of the war of resistance, we must not only invigorate our spirit and concentrate our spirit, but also prioritize spirit and use material as a means. By enhancing the strong and determined spirit of the national people, we can overcome all difficulties and defeat the tyrannical Japanese. Now, in order to thoroughly implement this outline, the organization work of all sectors of the city is being actively promoted. We expect that in the shortest possible time, people from all sectors of agriculture, industry, commerce, and academia can participate in the units of the sectoral organization according to the different departments of their profession. On the day of the start of the city's spiritual mobilization, regarding the six things that must first be paid attention to in the spiritual life of the people, this association is willing to encourage all the compatriots in the city:

Participate in Group Life

Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, the population of the special zone has suddenly increased to more than four million. During the Battle of Shanghai, regardless of men, women, old or young, whether serving in the war zone or supporting in the rear, everyone participated in the organization of resisting Japan and saving the nation. When the National Army withdrew westward, restricted by objective conditions, the work of saving the nation was decentralized, with each person standing at their own post and intensifying their efforts. Now that the later stage of the war of resistance has begun dramatically, its tasks are a hundred times more difficult and greater than before. Our compatriots must strengthen the power of resisting Japan in close coordination with the situation in the later stage of the war of resistance. Therefore, the efforts of everyone standing at their posts must return to collective struggle. Now that this association has officially announced its establishment, organizations in various sectors will be established separately within days. It is hoped that compatriots in the agricultural sector of the city will participate in the branch organizations of the National Spiritual Mobilization Association of the [Agriculture] Sector; compatriots in the industrial sector will participate in the branch organizations of the Industrial Sector; teachers and students in the education sector will participate in the branch organizations of the Education Sector; and compatriots in the cultural sector will participate in the branch organization of the Cultural Sector. Other citizens, women, youths, etc., should also participate in the branch organizations of their respective sectors. In short, every citizen must participate in the National Spiritual Mobilization Association and move towards the path of collective struggle together.

Concentrate Organizational Power

Since Chairman Chiang announced the implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline, some people in the city have spontaneously established organizations and tried their best to promote it, which is of course a very good phenomenon. Now that this association has announced its establishment, in order to concentrate our strength, we require all established organizations to participate in this association. In the negative aspect, this can avoid the disadvantages of disunity and confusion. In the positive aspect, we can concentrate all our strength and strive for the great cause of resisting and building the nation. We firmly believe that this will definitely win the support and sympathy of all compatriots in the city.

Strengthen the Will to Resist

The later stage of the war of resistance has dramatically unfolded. The [Japanese] know very well that the future of the war of aggression will only sink deeper and deeper, and the national strength will decline day by day. Therefore, recent military aggression and political conspiracies have been closely coordinated, attempting to threaten our spirit of resisting Japan and shake our belief in victory with their most tyrannical ferocity. In fact, the military and civilians of the entire country deeply believe that the blood debt of hundreds of years between China and Japan must be fully repaid in this war of resistance. They also deeply believe that only by resisting Japan to the end can we win the independence, freedom, and equality of our country. Therefore, no matter how much the [Japanese] exhaust their barbaric and cruel capabilities, they will not only fail to threaten our spirit but will increase our belief in the inevitable victory of the war of resistance; not only will they fail to shake our will, but they will strengthen our determination to "not rest until the [Japanese] are driven out." Our spirit of resisting Japan must be even more inspiring during the period when the [Japanese] threaten and oppress us more severely; our will to resist Japan must be even more strengthened and consolidated today when the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement is launched; all the peaceful atmosphere and compromise news manufactured by the [Japanese] and traitors must be absolutely rejected and thoroughly corrected.

Eliminate the Psychology of Fear and Cowardice

Since the National Army withdrew westward, although Shanghai has become an isolated island, the citizens of the entire city not only have no psychology of cowardice at all, but also have an even stronger and more determined spirit of resisting Japan and saving the nation, even more so than during the Battle of Shanghai. On commemorative holidays, the national flag flies in every household throughout the city, and even if they are unreasonably interfered with, they will never be threatened in the slightest, nor will they hesitate. However, it is precisely because of the unyielding and heroic resistance of March 12 that the magnificent brilliance of March 29 was created, so that the [Japanese] and traitors could not use their tricks. This spirit of fearlessness is the manifestation of the national soul of our Republic of China, and it is also the firm guarantee that our country will surely win the final victory. There is no such thing as danger, only danger has meaning; there is no such thing as sacrifice, only sacrifice has value—fear is just a tool of suicide—resistance is the condition for victory. This has been proved with iron evidence in the history of the world's nations and亡史, without any doubt. Today, when the National Spiritual Mobilization is beginning to be implemented, the psychology of fear and cowardice should be completely eliminated, and the spirit of fearlessness should be further promoted and carried forward.

Promote National Spirit

During the period of more than one year since the National Army withdrew westward, the patriotism of the Shanghai compatriots has been seen by the whole world. Although the power of the government is no longer sufficient, our compatriots have always obeyed the government's laws and respected the government's intentions without interruption. This great and noble national spirit is admired by both China and foreign countries. We hope that compatriots throughout the city will further promote and carry forward this national spirit in the future. If anyone uses special forces to violate the law and disrupt order, we will concentrate all revolutionary forces to give them the most severe sanctions, so that no slightest stain will be left in this great and glorious history of resisting Japan and building the nation.

Temper National Integrity

In the history books of our country, which has been established for more than 5,000 years, whenever the country encounters the most difficult times, the boundless and uninterrupted national integrity must be further promoted and carried forward. During this war of resistance, the facts that can be sung and cried about, whether in cities or towns, are constantly reported. This is the most obvious evidence. Compatriots throughout the city should maintain and promote this national integrity, and everyone should have the determination to "rather starve to death than disgrace the country." They would rather sacrifice themselves than tarnish the country. [Japanese Hidden], the [Japanese], will eventually succumb to our national integrity, which is supremely strong and great!

The above six matters are what this association sincerely tells all compatriots in the city. It is hoped that our people will deeply understand them, strive to practice them, and the completion of the great cause of the war of resistance is based on this—Headquarters of the Shanghai All-Circles National Spiritual Mobilization Association.

### The Status Quo in the Mediterranean and Balkans Should Not Be Disturbed; British Prime Minister Clarifies His Determination to Resist Aggression, Provides Concrete Guarantees to Greece and Romania

[Reuters, London, 13th] British Prime Minister Chamberlain, after explaining the British government's view on Italy's seizure of Albania in the House of Commons this afternoon, said: "The British Imperial Government deeply feels the responsibility and obligation to clarify its position and clear up external doubts about Britain. I take this opportunity to declare that the British Imperial Government is determined to prevent, with its utmost efforts, any attempt to disrupt the "status quo" in the Mediterranean or the Balkan Peninsula by threat or force. Therefore, any action that clearly threatens the independence of Greece or Romania, and at the same time, the governments of Greece and Romania believe that they must use their national power to resist, will be regarded by the Imperial Government as having a mutual assistance pact with Greece and Romania, and will spare no effort. We have notified each country concerned and other countries of this declaration. I know that the French government is also drafting a similar declaration. Regarding all changes and developments, the governments of all autonomous territories have also been notified as usual. I only want to add one or two points about what I have observed. As far as I am concerned, I would like to state that no extremely emotional event has occurred to date that is sufficient to change my judgment and believe that the Anglo-Italian agreement signed by the Imperial Government a year ago is an unsuitable policy. I make this statement to avoid any misunderstanding of my current attitude, not to provoke debate. I can frankly admit that I am undoubtedly deeply disappointed with the Italian government's actions this time. Many people in the country believe that the Anglo-Italian agreement should now be terminated. However, I really cannot agree with this observation, because anyone who claims to be responsible will never want to take hasty action in the current situation, which will increase the tension in the international situation. Therefore, I deeply believe that the people of the country must hope that the agreement can be effectively fulfilled. In view of all the recent changes, we should first look at whether the Italian government can provide concrete evidence to show that it also has the same wishes. Regarding Italy's withdrawal of its volunteer soldiers stationed in the west, the British government has repeatedly agreed to Italy's request. In the exchange of official letters, the Italian side notified the British government that as soon as the victory parade in Madrid was over, it would withdraw Italian volunteer soldiers. The government has paid considerable attention to this new guarantee from Italy, because the government has always believed that the withdrawal of Italian volunteer soldiers is an important element of the Anglo-Italian agreement. We have been patiently waiting for a long time. Although we often encounter various obstacles and disturbances in our efforts to eliminate suspicion and promote friendship, we have always endured it. I really do not want to believe that such painstaking efforts have no effect at all. I also hope that all members of parliament will not think that my government has not continued to contact the Soviet Union just because I have not mentioned the Soviet Union. There are extremely difficult things that need to be solved by us at present. Therefore, we should not only take care of our own expectations, but also consider what others are willing to do. I ask the entire House to put aside prejudices, remove preconceived notions, and deeply believe that the government has made its utmost efforts to call on all those who still advocate peace to unite. Today, what I mean by saying that we should show a firm resolve is not only to strengthen ourselves and defend ourselves, but also to fulfill our responsibilities and stand on the same front with all countries that have been subjected to aggression or threatened with the loss of freedom and are determined to resist." Foreign Minister Halifax also issued a similar statement in the House of Lords.

### British Parliamentarians Advocate Cooperation with the Soviet Union; German and Italian Reactions Show No Regret; Romania is Gratified and the People are Encouraged

[Reuters, London, 13th] Liberal Party leader Sinclair said at a meeting of the House of Commons today, referring to the Albania incident, "This blatant act of aggression has torn the last shred of the compromise policy to pieces. This act violates the Anglo-Italian agreement and the gentleman's agreement on which it is based." He also declared, "We have encountered the conspiracy of the Axis powers." Sinclair then demanded that the government quickly establish a supply department, and continued, "Let us prepare first to prove our determination, and then unite the threatened countries to go to our common purpose." Sinclair strongly advocated the need for Britain to maintain friendship with the Soviet Union.

[Reuters, London, 13th] After Chamberlain issued a declaration in the House of Commons today, opposition Labor Party leader Attlee expressed disappointment, stating that since Italy has broken the agreement, the Anglo-Italian agreement has lost its value in maintaining peace. It is gratifying that the British government has given guarantees to the countries of Poland, Greece, and Romania, but it is not thorough. In short, universal guarantees should be made based on the League of Nations Covenant to seek collective security. If collective security is to be established today, it is impossible without the integration of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.

[Reuters, London, 13th] Churchill gave a speech in the House of Commons today on his views on the status of the Mediterranean, agreeing with the government that it would not be beneficial to refute the Anglo-Italian agreement at present. He criticized the British fleet for spreading across the Mediterranean during Easter, saying, "If the British fleet is concentrated in the Ionian Sea and engaged in patrols, I believe Italy will not make an adventurous aggression against Albania. Now is not the time to take a no-bottom approach. If we want to preserve peace, we must immediately take two steps: one is to invite the Soviet Union to participate in peace talks, and the other is the unity of the Balkans. If the four Balkan countries can unite consistently and resolutely, they can obtain security. I do not believe that Italy has determined to fight a decisive battle with Britain and France." Labor Party member Dalton strongly advocated that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union conclude a military alliance, as well as against aggression in Europe, Asia, or North Africa. Finance Minister Simon replied that the British government has no intention of rejecting the Soviet Union or not wanting the Soviet Union to participate in peace work. The debate then ended, and the House of Commons decided to reopen on Tuesday next week.

[Reuters, London, 13th] Today, British Foreign Minister Halifax said in the House of Lords that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had notified British Ambassador to Italy, Pens, on the 9th of this month that after the Italian army withdrew from Spain, Italian aircraft and pilots would also be withdrawn. Members of the House of Lords, Snall and Marquis of Lothian, representing the Labor Party and the Liberal Party respectively, strongly stated that forming an alliance with the Soviet Union was absolutely important.

[Reuters, London, 14th] The initial reactions in Rome and Berlin to Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons yesterday were that the attitude of Germany and Italy, the Axis powers, was firm and showed no regret. The people of the Romanian capital were extremely encouraged. Officials were comforted by the fact that Britain had guaranteed [Romania's] security. The Hungarian capital still believes that the international crisis is fraught with dangers. The problem thereafter still lies in the future actions of the Axis powers. German officials said that they would not criticize it temporarily until the full text had been studied, but they continued to attack Britain. Italian officials said leniently that Chamberlain's speech had admitted that the Albania incident, if "interpreted properly," had not damaged the Anglo-Italian agreement and the status quo in the Mediterranean. It is questionable that the British Prime Minister's declaration stated that the Adriatic Sea is part of the Mediterranean Sea. At the same time, there are doubts about whether Britain has the ability to ensure the safety of Romania, Greece, and Poland, saying that Italy has already made a commitment to Greece, so Britain's guarantees to other countries are superfluous. As for the British House of Commons, everyone welcomed Chamberlain's speech. Supporters of the government believed that the future still depends on the attitude and actions of other countries, so the Prime Minister's mission is extremely difficult. They welcomed the Prime Minister's guarantees to Romania and Greece, but believed that they had not been thorough enough. They hoped that there could be more detailed reports on relations with the Soviet Union. If the two countries could establish a concrete agreement, it would be of great benefit to the current international situation.

### French Prime Minister Issues Important Declaration Following British Prime Minister; Determined to Defend National Territory with All Strength; Jointly Assist Greece and Romania

[Reuters, Paris, 13th] French Prime Minister Daladier, on behalf of the French government, made the same declaration as British Prime Minister Chamberlain on behalf of the British government. The French Prime Minister said that the purpose of the government's policy has been discussed in his broadcast speech on March 29. Since then, France has buried itself in hard work, not focusing on empty words or taking actions of no value. The country has implemented military measures, which are sufficient to guarantee the security of France and the territory of the French Empire, and are powerful enough to cope with any foreign aggression. The French government has been constantly maintaining permanent close contact with the governments of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Poland, and the Balkan countries. He believes that the purpose of these governments is to seek cooperation between countries and not to threaten the survival interests of anyone, but to resolutely resist all monopolistic ambitions. He will be able to achieve this. The French Prime Minister also said that the deep understanding between Britain and France has produced a force that has never existed before. Finally, Daladier read his declaration supporting the joint assistance of Britain and France to Greece and Romania.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 13th] Cabinet Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier gave a broadcast speech to the people on the afternoon of the 13th, stating that the French government has taken military measures to defend the borders of the mainland and colonies in order to respond to all contingencies. The conscripts of all levels of reservists who were called up were able to enthusiastically join the army, which is commendable. Regarding France's position on the current international situation, I have explained it on March 29. In short, at a time when the European situation is unstable, France is determined to maintain peace within the scope of freedom and honor. The first step is to strengthen national defense and to strengthen the ties with the nations who are determined to resist aggression and maintain freedom. In particular, we should maintain constant contact with the governments of Britain, the United States, Soviet Russia, Poland, and the Balkan Agreement countries, namely Turkey, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Greece. The goal we are aiming for is to form the necessary cooperation between the nations who have no intention of threatening the vital interests of other countries, who are determined to resist various aggressive attempts, and who are willing to discuss the current issues openly and honestly, and we firmly believe that this goal can be achieved. As for the mutual understanding between Britain and France, it has never been so close and solid. I am now speaking to the people with the prior consent of the governments of Britain and France. At this point, Prime Minister Daladier said that the French government had declared to Romania and Greece that if the sovereignty of these countries were threatened, it would assist them with all its strength. The British and Polish governments have accepted mutual constraints, declaring that they will assist each other when they encounter direct or indirect threats in order to defend their independence and sovereignty. The French government is very pleased to hear about this. The existing alliance treaty between France and Poland has also been reaffirmed in the same spirit. When the vital interests of both countries are directly or indirectly threatened, they should immediately rise up to help each other. This approach should be notified to the governments of all relevant countries, especially the Turkish government. In short, maintaining territorial integrity and the security of the colonial empire in order to respond to various direct and indirect threats is the right of France. The government is aware of the great responsibility of implementing this policy and will complete the country's destiny with a firm will and a loyal and守的 determination.

The bill has been sent to the Senate for consideration.

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] According to reliable sources, the Navy Department is currently planning to make the two new 45,000-ton warships the fastest. The original plan to install 18 large-caliber guns in the ships has now been abandoned in order to increase speed.

### Italian Public Wildly Demonstrates Against France; Mussolini Boasts of Military Prowess, to Soon Announce Rule Over Albania

[Associated Press, Rome, 13th] The Fascist Grand Council met today, presided over by Mussolini. Several thousand people gathered in Venice Square. Mussolini delivered a speech from the balcony of the Venice Palace, declaring, "The unprecedented achievements of the past few days are due to our loyalty and strength. To friendly nations, we wish to show a friendly attitude; to hostile nations, we wish to show a clear and resolute hostility. We now ask the world to quickly let us bury ourselves in our daily work. Today, the world should understand that we will always move forward, as we have in the past, and will continue to do so in the future." Officials below the balcony shouted, "March on Paris!"

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 13th] During the meeting of the Fascist Grand Council in Venice Palace today, there was a large-scale demonstration. Fascist party members, flags, military bands, and large groups of people gathered in front of the palace. When Mussolini appeared on the balcony, demonstrators shouted, "Down with France!" and "March on Paris!"

[Associated Press, Albanian Capital, 14th] According to sources here, King Victor Emmanuel of Italy will come here to accept the Albanian throne. Fascist party headquarters claim that the Italian government will soon announce its rule over Albania. Italian troops have already occupied most of Albania, with only the mountainous border areas still in Albanian hands.

[Reuters, Rome, 13th] Tonight, the Fascist Grand Council met and passed a resolution approving the Italian King's acceptance of the Albanian throne. After the meeting, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini addressed a crowd of 45,000, saying that the recent events were a manifestation of the Italian people's will, confidence, and strength. Mussolini declared, "Please, world, do not interfere with our great daily tasks." Upon hearing this, the crowd responded with cries of "On to Tunis!" and "On to Corsica!"

### Mussolini Invites Göring for a Meeting

[Associated Press, Rome, 13th] Official sources here announced that Mussolini has invited General Göring to spend a week here. Göring is currently traveling here from Tripoli.

[Associated Press, Rome, 13th] Fascist party members stated that Italy will not only strengthen ties with Germany but will also actively cooperate with Spain and Hungary to counter the guarantees given by Britain and France to Greece and Romania. Because Britain and France are currently attempting to encircle us, Germany and Italy must resist. At the same time, Göring is scheduled to arrive in Rome on Friday, and Romanian Prime Minister Gheorghe Tătărescu will also arrive within a few days. This is receiving widespread attention.

### US President's Broadcast Warns Authoritarian States; Pittman Advocates Economic Sanctions Against Japan

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver a broadcast to the nation at 4 PM today. It is generally believed that he will warn authoritarian states against invading Latin American territory.

[Associated Press, Charlottesville, 13th] US Under Secretary of State Welles, speaking at the University of Virginia's Founder's Day celebration today, strongly criticized "a few malicious elements" threatening world peace and called on the United States to sell all necessary goods to peace-loving nations to prevent their conquest. Welles also strongly condemned the brutal and tyrannical behavior of authoritarian states and said that the main goal of the US government is to maintain peace within the United States, citing President Roosevelt's warning that the US opposes any acts of aggression that affect Americans.

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] Senator Pittman stated today that the signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty are committed to respecting China's territorial integrity. Therefore, he strongly supports the government recognizing Japan as a country that violates the treaty. In the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Pittman stated that he personally has a method to use economic means to force Japan to end its actions that damage American interests in China. This method can be used when the United States implements this measure. The above statement was made by Pittman in response to an inquiry from Mrs. Leiter, representative of six women's organizations. The inquiry mentioned that the United States' human power would disappear due to the limitations of neutrality, and at the same time, it would make the United States a silent partner of the aggressor.

### Germany's New Aggressive Intentions Towards the Baltic Sea; Demands Revision of the Memel Convention; Lithuania Uncovers Pro-German Conspiracy

[Associated Press, London, 13th] A "News Chronicle" correspondent in Warsaw reports that the German government has notified Lithuania that the recently signed Memel Convention needs a "new revision." Under the provisions of this new revision, Lithuania cannot obtain the promised free zone in Memel, nor can it build ports on the Baltic Sea. All Lithuanian trade must go through Memel. This demand is considered a warning to Lithuania and also indicates Germany's new aggressive intentions towards Lithuania and the Baltic Sea. Poland's main interests are in the Baltic Sea, and it is believed here that if Germany further aggresses against Lithuania or other countries in the Baltic region, Poland will not be able to continue to remain silent.

[Associated Press, London, 13th] "The Daily Herald" today carries a report from Warsaw stating that Lithuania recently uncovered a conspiracy to incorporate Lithuania into Germany. Major arrests were made in the Lithuanian capital. Army Commander-in-Chief General Raštikis personally arrested Colonel Balušis, who was pro-German. Those arrested also include former Prime Minister Tubelis and former Foreign Minister Zaunius. The conspirators attempted to seize government power and then sign a commercial agreement with Germany, completely reducing Lithuania to a political and economic dependency of Germany.

Brief Commentary

### British, American, and French Declarations

After Italy's occupation of Albania, the remaining five Balkan countries feel the pain of "when the lips are gone, the teeth are cold." Seeing the "collusion" between Italian and German aggressors, the whole of Europe is already facing a greater crisis, and even the Latin American crisis has suddenly become serious due to the rampant actions of the Italian and German aggressors. This new situation certainly makes some small and weak countries feel the pain of "national demise is imminent," but the British, French, and American countries are also worried about the fate of their countries and world peace.

Under the threat of this objective environment, the British, French, and American countries cannot but move towards uniting democratic and peace-loving countries to jointly resist fascist aggressors. The Soviet Union's peace policy has thus begun to be trusted and expected by all parties. According to reports in the past two days, British Prime Minister Chamberlain declared on the afternoon of the 13th that he would guarantee Greece and Romania, and French Prime Minister Daladier also issued the same declaration on behalf of the government that evening. And US President Roosevelt also broadcast to the country on the afternoon of the 14th, issuing a warning against the totalitarian countries invading Latin America. From this, it can be seen that democratic and peace-loving countries can only be forced to expand the peace front and resist the future of fascist aggressors.

However, this kind of declaration by Britain and France is still a one-sided, temporary, and very weak official statement, and the American anti-aggression movement has not yet developed to the necessary extent to combat aggression. There is no doubt that this declaration and expression cannot truly prevent aggression and prevent war. Yesterday, Reuters London also reported that Rome and Berlin are still tough after Chamberlain's declaration was issued on the 13th. As British Labour Party leader Attlee said: "We need a real guarantee policy, we need to establish a permanent collective security architecture, not just a policy that only seeks peace for a week or half a month. If we want to avoid war, we must have enough strength to deter all aggression, therefore, when we have not heard the status of the Soviet Union being mentioned, we cannot help but express special regret!"

### German Naval Exercises to Be Held off the Coast of Spain; British Naval Circles Closely Monitor

[Reuters, London, 13th] It is reported that the German government has notified the governments of Britain and France that, as usual, the German fleet's spring maneuvers this year will be held off the coast of Spain for about a month. The ships participating in the exercise are scheduled to depart from various German ports on April 18th. Among them are three "Deutschland" class pocket battleships, three cruisers, and a fleet of destroyers, submarines, and other auxiliary ships.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th] The German government has recently decided to dispatch a naval fleet, including six cruisers, three of which belong to the Deutschland-class, all 10,000-ton pocket battleships, and several submarines, to Spanish territorial waters for a period of one month. According to informed sources, the warships are scheduled to depart from Wilhelmshaven Port this evening, will conduct exercises in Spanish waters, and may anchor in Spanish ports or be inspected by General Franco.

[Central News Agency, London, 13th] Official sources have recently announced that the German government has notified the governments of Britain and France that the German Navy's spring exercises this year will be held in Spanish waters for a period of one month. Naval circles here commented that at this time of the development of the European situation, this move by Germany has significant political or military significance. Recently, rumors have spread that when Spain joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, an annex was signed allowing Germany to use Spanish naval bases. Judging from this matter, it seems to reveal something and should be closely monitored. As for the defense of British Gibraltar, the government has recently taken special technical measures to renovate and strengthen it, making it exceptionally solid, and we are not afraid of attacks from the sea or from land.

Spain Will Again Become the Center of Events

[Central News Agency, Paris, 13th] Political figures here recently stated that at this time, Spain has the possibility of becoming the center of international events again, which is particularly worrying. Although the Italian government has provided assurances to Britain, declaring its willingness to withdraw volunteer soldiers from Spain as soon as possible, the information received here is the opposite. For example, the Spanish National Army government is taking military measures near British Gibraltar and in Spanish Morocco, firstly; one-third of the German fleet is sailing to Spanish waters, secondly; German newspapers are suddenly advocating that Spain's position is very important, thirdly; foreign troops and arms are continuously being transported to the port of Cadiz in southern Spain, fourthly. Although this is denied daily by the Spanish National Army government, the news that comes contradicts this announcement. Since the National Army government joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, German newspapers have taken the opportunity to exaggerate Spain's wishes. According to one view, the Spanish side's various attitudes recently are a response from a certain country to Britain and France's guarantee of the security of Greece and Romania. The purpose is to plan ahead and seek a base during wartime. Britain and France should pay close attention.

[Central News Agency, British Gibraltar, 13th] The port of La Línea de la Concepción in Spain (adjacent to Gibraltar) has been under strict guard for several days, and a large number of military supplies have been transported from the port of Cadiz, including field guns, machine guns, tanks, bullets, and gunpowder. Two to three thousand National Army troops have been arriving there since the 11th. In addition, many large transport ships have recently been traveling between the ports of Ceuta and Melilla in Spanish Morocco in North Africa and the port of Almería in southern Spain.

Gibraltar Hastens Construction of Fortifications

[Central News Agency, British Gibraltar, 13th] After the Spanish National Army government concentrated troops in the area adjacent to this port, the military authorities here have also taken appropriate preventive measures for vigilance. Two hundred engineers have been rushing to build solid obstacles on the road 200 meters from the border between Britain and Spain for days. La Línea de la Concepción in Spain has reportedly ordered the requisition of all types of vehicles in the city.

[Associated Press, Malta, 13th] All personnel of the British Navy fleet here have been ordered to return to their ships by midnight on Thursday. The transport ship "Nivana" arrived here on Thursday evening, carrying 500 soldiers for reinforcement.

[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] France has recently taken military precautions on the Pyrenees border to cope with the increase in Franco's troops.

Danzig Germans Prepare for Reckless Action

[Associated Press, London, 14th] In the past twenty-four hours, the European situation has become more tense. Wartime preparations in various countries are accelerating. Anti-French demonstrations have erupted in Italy, with crowds shouting "March on Paris." Relations between Romania and Hungary are deteriorating, and both sides are concentrating troops on the border. According to reports, Germany and Italy have concentrated troops on the border of Yugoslavia. The current city in crisis is still Danzig. Germany has launched large-scale demonstrations there, as it did before in the Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia, and Memel. Next week is Hitler's 50th birthday, and it is generally believed that the day will mark the start of the European crisis. However, the Germans are preparing to hold fierce demonstrations on that day to celebrate his birthday. They plan to demand the cancellation of the League of Nations commissioner in Danzig and establish close ties between Danzig and Germany.

[Associated Press, Paris, 13th] France is paying close attention to reports that German and Italian troops are concentrated on the Yugoslav border, as Yugoslavia and Bulgaria are important points in the British and French anti-aggression lines. At the same time, France is also very concerned about Britain's failure to obtain the Soviet Union's participation in anti-aggression work. However, reports say that Britain is considering taking military action with the Soviet Union alone.

### Conspiracy to Seize Far East Shipping; Competition Among Various Countries Sharply Intensifies; British, American, French, and Dutch Shipping Companies Greatly Increase Ships Sailing to the Far East; Competing to Purchase Chinese Ships to Expand Routes

Since the full-scale War of Resistance against Japan began, the coast and rivers have been filled with smoke and fire, and Japanese warships have roamed freely, violently blockading everything. As a result, Chinese state-owned and private ships have been forced to cease operations, and the Chinese shipping industry has disintegrated due to Japanese oppression. Under these extraordinary circumstances, Japanese shipping companies are taking advantage of the expansion of their military influence to seize the entire Chinese coastline and river shipping rights, manipulating and monopolizing them, and further controlling the entire Far East Pacific shipping industry. European and American shipping companies have risen up to compete with Japanese companies, taking the opportunity to greatly expand Far East routes, adding many ships to sail on Far East routes, competing through business operations, and at the same time, mutually purchasing Chinese state-owned and private shipping company ships, changing their names, and joining various routes. This situation has evolved to an extremely sharp point today.

Britain and the United States Strongly Urge the Opening of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers

Yesterday, reporters investigated with relevant parties in Hong Kong and China. It is said that Britain, the United States, and France have greater rights and interests in the Far East shipping industry, especially in the Chinese rivers and inland waterways, than any other European and American countries. Since the war has spread to the Yangtze and Pearl River basins, the Japanese, in order to realize their monopoly and seizure conspiracy, have illegally blockaded them under the pretext of the existence of a dangerous military situation, refusing ships from various countries to sail. The losses suffered by the United States and France in business are difficult to estimate, and the indirect impact on the sales of goods from various countries in China is not insignificant. The governments of Britain, the United States, and France, finding it difficult to obtain any results through normal diplomatic channels, have decided to contact the relevant European and American countries to take a firm stance to negotiate with Japan for the opening of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers and the waterways of the occupied guerrilla areas, to restore the normal state before the "July 7th" Incident, so that ships from various countries can sail as usual according to treaties. Otherwise, they will unanimously take retaliatory actions in the economic field to put pressure on Japan, in order to achieve this legitimate goal of maintaining rights and interests.

Shipping Companies from Various Countries Increase Ships Sailing to the Far East

At the same time, people in shipping companies from various countries, in the current special situation, in order to enhance the maintenance of their position and rights in the Far East, must quickly expand their Far East shipping industry, so as not to fall behind and weaken the Chinese goods market. Therefore, they are all paying special attention to the expansion of the Far East shipping industry. The main countries in the Far East shipping industry, in addition to Britain, the United States, France, Japan, the Soviet Union, and Germany, also include more than a dozen second-tier countries such as Panama, Portugal, Norway, Greece, and Sweden, which also have considerable ships sailing to the Far East. Now, the competition among various countries for Far East shipping is becoming increasingly fierce, and they are all engaged in self-expansion. The governments of various countries are taking advantage of the opportunity to subsidize their shipping companies, increasing the construction of improved large and small ships to join the Far East sailing. British companies such as the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O), Taikoo, China Navigation Company, and Jardine Matheson & Co. are all increasing fast ships sailing on the routes along the Indian Ocean and the Pacific coast, as well as Chinese inland rivers and coastal areas, increasing the frequency of voyages to various ports. American postal shipping companies, such as Dollar Steamship Lines, have successively resumed the sailing of their President liners, which have been suspended for a long time, directly to the ports of Shanghai and other ports in the Far East via the Pacific Ocean, and at the same time, they have reduced passenger fares and improved all supplies for passengers on the ships. French, German, Italian, and other postal shipping companies are also eagerly planning to develop their Far East route businesses. Shipping companies in Portugal, the Netherlands, Panama, the Soviet Union, Norway, and other countries are also taking the same steps. The Swedish East Asiatic Company recently added five new-style electric cargo ships to the Far East routes. The construction of the first ship, the "Kinnaird," has been completed, and the second sister ship will be launched this summer. The remaining three ships will be completed in 1940 and will come to the Far East after completion.

Competing to Purchase Chinese Ships to Expand the Far East Shipping Industry

Among the shipping companies from various countries that are actively expanding the Far East shipping industry, increasing the construction of new ships is certainly being accelerated, but in terms of time, it is not as easy to develop and achieve practical results as purchasing Chinese state-owned and private ships. Therefore, after the suspension of operations of Chinese ships, shipping companies from various countries have started to compete to purchase them. According to accurate reports from the Hong Kong and China shipping industry, apart from the four newly built ships of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, "Yuan," "Xiang," "Li," and "Zhen," which have been sold to Jardine Matheson & Co., the "Haixiang," "Hairui," and various river ships are all in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The "Xinming," "Taishun," "Xinjiangtian," "Tonghua," "Xinfeng," and other seagoing ships have all been sunk to serve as blockade lines. The private Sanbei ships have been sold to the Italian-Chinese Company, and the "Dada" and "Datong" ships are all moored in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The "Luxing," "Zhoushan," "Taizhou," and "Ping'an" ships have been sold to Portuguese merchants, and the "Hefeng" and other ships have been sold to American merchants. The "Huashang" and other ships have been sold to Panamanian merchants, and the "Ningshao" and other ships have been sold to German merchants. Those sunk to serve as blockade lines include the "Huaping" and "Taiping" ships. After British, American, German, Portuguese, Greek, and Panamanian shipping companies purchased Chinese ships, they have been working hard to expand coastal and downstream routes in China to compete with Japanese shipping companies. Newly organized foreign shipping companies after the war, such as the Italian-Chinese Company, the American-owned Wilhailm, Huamei, the Portuguese-owned Zhengde, Meili, the German-owned Far East, and the German-owned Lihe, Lulin, and the Norwegian-owned Hualun, are all operating shipping businesses. The Ningbo, Taizhou, and Wenzhou in Zhejiang, the Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Fuzhou in Fujian, as well as the Shanghai-Chongming, coastal routes in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Shanghai-Tongyang route, and the North and South Ocean routes, are all being operated by ships dispatched by foreign shipping companies.

Japanese Merchants Eager to Deduct Monopoly Shipping Rights

Under the active development of the Far East shipping industry by shipping companies from various countries, what deserves our attention is that Japanese are taking the opportunity to manipulate and monopolize Far East shipping rights, placing them under their sphere of influence control, and fulfilling their dream of domination. In particular, they are targeting our coastal and inland river shipping rights. When the Yangtze River War extended to Wuhan, the Japanese Nisshin Kisen Kaisha obtained subsidies from the Japanese government to control the Yangtze River and the small ships in the inland rivers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. After looting our shipping merchants' ships, Chongming, Xinhongxing, and Tianci, they renamed them and monopolized the Shanghai-Chongming and Shanghai-Tong routes. Their shipping companies alone dispatched ships to travel in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and along the coast of Guangdong, preventing the opening of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. Now, they are expanding from the Chinese coast to routes directly to Southeast Asia, from Tianjin, Shanghai, and Xiamen to Singapore and Siam via Hong Kong. At the same time, in order to facilitate their manipulation and monopoly of shipping rights, they are arbitrarily detaining foreign ships under the pretext of investigating nationality. According to sources in the Hong Kong shipping industry, in addition to the foreign ships currently detained in the Provincial River, more than 20 ships belonging to Britain, France, Portugal, Panama, and other countries have been illegally detained, with the most being Portuguese-registered, accounting for about 12 or 13. About 6 or 7 Panamanian-registered ships have also been detained. The intention of the Japanese is nothing more than to hinder the development of the Far East shipping industry in various countries and to fulfill their conspiracy to manipulate and monopolize it.

### Hutcheon Jewelry Company; Bizarre Major Daylight Theft Occurs; Three Diamond Rings Disappear, Valued at Over $6,000; $500 Worth of Jewelry Stolen from the Xu Residence on Glass Street

A bizarre case of three thieves stealing valuable jewelry occurred at the Hutcheon Jewelry Company on Pedder Street the day before yesterday. On the afternoon of the 13th, three Shanghai men, all well-dressed, went to the company claiming to buy a pocket watch. After discussing the price for a long time, they left without making a purchase. When discussing the price, the three men had no other suspicious movements. After the three men left, it was discovered that three diamond rings were missing, one valued at $3,840, one valued at $1,840, and one valued at $800, for a total value of $6,480. People in the company considered this case to be bizarre and had no idea how the theft occurred, so they went to the Chinese Police Station yesterday morning to report the case. It is said that the authorities are paying close attention to this bizarre case and are currently conducting a thorough investigation. Also, the Xu residence on Glass Street in Causeway Bay went to the Shau Kei Wan Police Station yesterday morning to report that a gold bracelet and a gold necklace, worth more than $500 in total, had been stolen within 12 hours. The duty officer took the report, recorded it, and sent detectives to investigate. Due to the bizarre nature of the theft, it is suspected that a family thief is difficult to guard against. The workers in the residence were taken back to the police station for questioning to find out the truth.

### Although the Plague Has Passed, Ships from Shantou to Hong Kong Still Need to Enter Quarantine; Third-Class Passengers Still Not Allowed to Land Freely; No Results from Requests by Chaozhou and Jiaying Chambers of Commerce

The Hong Kong health authorities, due to the plague that occurred in Shantou this year, announced the port as a plague-affected port. All ships coming to Hong Kong from Shantou must enter quarantine, and passengers, except for those in first and second class, are not allowed to land freely. This has not changed to this day. The Hong Kong Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce and the Jiaying Chamber of Commerce believe that this type of inspection procedure is time-consuming and has a great impact on Hong Kong-Shantou trade. Some days ago, they jointly submitted a petition to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, requesting the restoration of free landing for passengers. At the same time, the chairmen of the two chambers of commerce also personally visited the Secretary for Chinese Affairs to make an effective request, requesting that he forward the matter to the health officer for consideration. However, the two chambers of commerce received a reply from the medical officer yesterday, which was not granted. According to Li Zifeng, chairman of the Chaozhou Chamber of Commerce, the medical officer's reply still does not allow passengers to land freely, and the reason given is that this matter should be handled with caution and should not be done carelessly. Originally, in the current South China War, Hong Kong-Shantou transportation is even more important, so the number of merchants traveling between Hong Kong and Shantou has also increased compared to before. If this continues, it will greatly affect Hong Kong-Shantou trade.

### Police Arrest Hawkers in Front of the New Central Market for Days - Prisoner Transport Pre-Positioned for Arrests

Since the reconstruction of the Central Market, the original meat, duck stalls, fruit stands, and vegetable stalls have been ordered to relocate. As a result, meat companies, fruit shops, and vegetable stores are ubiquitous in the Central district. However, some speculative hawkers believe that due to the market's dispersion, those who purchase meals in the morning and evening cannot concentrate their purchases in one place, which is inconvenient. Therefore, they carry shoulder poles and baskets, wandering around the Central Market and its vicinity, soliciting purchases. The police authorities consider this a violation, so they have dispatched prison vans to park in front of the market for days. As soon as they encounter such meat hawkers, they are arrested. Yesterday morning, a man carrying a bamboo basket containing dozens of fresh fish covered with a dirty white cloth whispered to potential customers. The police, seeing this, suddenly surprised him from behind and sent him to the prison van. Other vegetable hawkers displaying their goods on the side streets, fearing arrest, scattered in panic, creating chaos. Pedestrians were alarmed, as if a major disaster had occurred. As a result, the police searched and arrested several people, taking them back to the Central Police Station for prosecution.

### New Type of Siren Tested in Hong Kong Yesterday - Results Satisfactory

The Hong Kong Air Defense Committee recently ordered several new types of air raid sirens from England, which arrived in Hong Kong and were installed in various districts. The air defense authorities scheduled the first test for yesterday at 2:15 PM. The first siren lasted three minutes, indicating that enemy planes would invade Hong Kong within a few minutes. At 2:25 PM, the test continued with a long siren, also lasting three minutes, indicating that the air raid danger had passed. The test sites included the Central, Peak, Causeway Bay, and Sheung Wan police stations. The sirens sounded loudly, and the results were satisfactory. The air defense authorities plan to hold a third blackout drill in the near future.

### Countless Incidents - Pirates Run Rampant in Hong Kong Waters - Passenger and Cargo Boats Hijacked - Total Loss of Goods Exceeds Two Thousand Dollars

Piracy runs rampant in Hong Kong's territorial waters, and incidents of murder and robbery occur frequently. The previous day, cargo boats were hijacked successively in the waters off Kau Yi Chau and Deep Water Bay, resulting in losses of several thousand dollars. Details are as follows:

Cargo Boat

Lin Rong, 33, a native of Lufeng and the owner of cargo boat 1511V, loaded 350 cans of wood oil from Lufeng to Hong Kong on the tenth of this month, to be delivered to Yang Shengxiang Company on Wing Sing Street. At 1:00 PM on the thirteenth, when the boat arrived in the waters off Kau Yi Chau, it encountered a fishing boat carrying several pirates who fired shots into the air as a warning and ordered them to stop. The pirates then boarded the boat, threatened the crew, drove them into the hold, and nailed the hatch shut. They then moved the wood oil to their boat and fled. After the pirates left, Lin and the others managed to open the hatch and sailed back to Hong Kong, arriving yesterday afternoon and reporting the incident to the police station. The total loss from the robbery amounted to two thousand three hundred dollars.

Passenger Boat

Mai Fa, 51, a farmer from the New Territories, reported to the police station yesterday morning that at 3:00 PM the previous afternoon, he was returning to Yuen Long from Bao'an on an unidentified small boat with 21 passengers and about four or five crew members. When they arrived in the waters off Deep Bay, they were suddenly confronted by a pirate boat carrying six or seven bandits, most of whom were armed with pistols. They fired several shots into the air as a warning and ordered them to stop. Under threat, the boat complied. The four armed pirates immediately boarded, threatened them, pushed them into the hold, and searched them one by one, robbing him of forty-three Hong Kong dollars and five chickens. The losses of other passengers were not detailed. After looting, the pirates returned to their boat and fled towards Tai O. He requested that the case be filed and investigated.

### New Central Market - Stalls to Be Auctioned - Strict Prohibition of Monopoly

The Central Market, which has been under construction for three years, has recently been completed and is scheduled to open on May 1. The health authorities have issued a notice that the stalls in the market will be auctioned off on a fixed date, but attempts by monopolists to bid for all the stalls and profit from them are strictly prohibited. Successful bidders must operate the stalls themselves and are not allowed to sublet them for profit. Violators will have their rights revoked and may be severely punished. If the stalls fall into the hands of monopolists, they will be sublet repeatedly, driving up rental prices and affecting the market prices of goods. When the reporter asked Mr. Todd, Chairman of the Municipal Health Bureau, about this issue yesterday, he said that the authorities absolutely prohibit the practice of bidding for all the stalls and will impose severe penalties if discovered. However, Mr. Todd declined to disclose what steps the government will take to prevent subletting.

### Summer Solstice Lecture - Xia Yan to Speak - Tonight at 7:30 PM

### Overseas Chinese in Victoria Donate to the Fifth Route Army - Relief for Wounded Soldiers and Refugees

The overseas Chinese in Victoria, Canada, have organizations such as the Anti-Japanese Association, which raises funds for national salvation bonds and other national salvation activities. Their past donations and bond drives have been remarkable. Recently, with our generals gathering and the Guangdong army approaching, the recovery of the provincial capital is imminent. They have specially organized a "Fundraising Sub-Committee for Aiding Wounded Soldiers and Refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi" to raise funds for relief. The first fundraising theatrical performance of the committee was quite effective. Yesterday, they remitted over three thousand Hong Kong dollars to the Guangxi Bank in Hong Kong, entrusting the bank to forward it to General Li Baier of the Fifth Route Army for the relief of wounded soldiers and refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi. It is reported that the committee will continue to raise funds for continuous assistance.

### Flowers Have Fallen - Lingering Dreams of Zhuhai

Flowers have fallen, but flowers will bloom again. My sister, you are still young, don't lament the fading of the flowers. People say that flowers that fall and bloom again won't be as radiant. I think that blooming after withering will make them even more beautiful. Without the pressure of snow and frost, even the most beautiful flowers have limitations. Don't fear the mad bees and butterflies; why rely on a protective banner? Seeing the bright spring, the flowers may not have eyes. But when the flowers fall, the spring scenery is desolate. The tide will also turn; you've seen flowers bloom and fall often. Speaking of the cycle of nature, human affairs are always involved. When human affairs reach their limit, rely on heaven for judgment. When the masses work together, we can break through this difficult situation. Four hundred million hearts united, people will be wary. Even if the country is lost, the pearl will be returned to Hepu soon. Ah, don't stumble, don't believe you can't row upstream and reach the shore.

### Hearing About Going Dancing

— Ah Xiang

Hearing about going dancing, I change clothes before dark. With someone to accompany me, I'm not afraid to dance until dawn. Like butterflies, fluttering unrestrainedly through the flowers. If you don't spin like a windmill, how can you keep up with the soothing music? Four big thighs close together, not afraid of leaning.

High heels clatter against the slippery floor, ah, you must be careful. Dancing is so trendy these days, it's not just in hotel halls. If you mention a lively place, there's always a dance hall. During this time of national crisis, you are not cheerful, nor do you seem right. Like cold-blooded animals, a pair of lovebirds fly out. It's not just moralistic gentlemen who refuse to look at you. Even foreigners who see you, while they might not call you useless, will laugh at them for being heartless. Why not donate the money spent on soda and ice cream to set up a porridge kitchen, so that tens of millions of displaced compatriots don't have to eat old bran.

Moreover, the government's prohibitions are so strict, you should think about them. Even if you don't want to cultivate virtue, don't lose all conscience. China has never fought such a tragic war in thousands of years. Look at how many cities in the eighteen provinces are not occupied. Ah, I can't bear to say more. In short, I advise you to kindly refrain from dancing, ladies.

### Symbolizing the Rebirth of the Chinese Nation: A Young National Warrior: Fan Zheng - A Great Era Trains Such an Outstanding Child

— Qi Zhuo

Before the development of psychology, it was impossible to understand extraordinary child prodigies, so they were simply called "geniuses."

Genius is only a kind of "moldability"; after socialized collective life replaces the monotonous life of individualism, it is easier to explain that "era" and "environment" are important factors in promoting the development of genius. The Fan Zheng we are reporting on is such a child.

He is a thirteen-year-old boy whose hometown is Jilin in the lost Northeast. He is handsome and intelligent, and speaks fluent Northern Mandarin.

His family is a large family of "scholarly lineage," most of whom are intellectuals. When he was eight years old, his father went to Henan to teach, and he followed him to study at the Rotary Elementary School in Henan. After a year or so, he followed his father back to Peiping and studied at the Peiping Normal University Affiliated Elementary School. Because the teachers were not resisting Japan, he and several other children left the school, sacrificing the elementary school diploma he could have obtained. This was during the winter vacation of the fifteenth year of the Republic (1926), and he and his comrades edited the "Children's Life" weekly in the Peiping New News, which was also a garden for their spirit and vitality.

Coincidentally, the New An Traveling Troupe went north from Shanghai to comfort the troops in Suiyuan and passed through Peiping. Their "Children's Life" published a welcome special page, and they met the New An Traveling Troupe. As they lived together, they became closer and closer. In March of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic (1937), Fan Zheng officially joined the New An Traveling Troupe, the only children's group in the country. His enlightened father allowed his request. His loving mother was a little worried. "I'll be back in a few months," he firmly coaxed his mother, and from then on, he received the baptism of life education and embarked on a great journey.

From Peiping to Suiyuan, and from Suiyuan to Ningxia, most of the journey was traveled on his own "two-wheeled vehicle." Just as they stepped into Ningxia, the sound of the guns of the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident) rang out. The "study" and "work" of their New An Traveling Troupe became more active and tense to meet the needs of the war of resistance. From Ningxia to Gansu, to Shaanxi, to Henan, all the way to participating in the work of defending Greater Wuhan. Under the appointment of the Political Department, the work unfolded more smoothly, becoming a heat wave in the national salvation movement, a bright page in the history of children's movement.

They worked in Wuhan for three months, until the day Guangzhou fell, a few days before the evacuation of Wuhan and Macau, they left Wuhan and went to Guilin to work. Because the China National Salvation Drama Troupe needed the New An Traveling Troupe to send a child to participate in overseas work, Fan Zheng was nominated by his comrades to join the China National Salvation Drama Troupe. He departed from Guilin with the troupe, passed through Shaoguan and Shantou, and arrived in Hong Kong. Fan Zheng told the reporter this little history himself. He is truly a capable young national warrior.

The reporter met this lovely child when he attended the commemorative meeting with him on Children's Day. He had an article "How to Spend This Year's Children's Day" published in this newspaper, which was also well-written. The more I talked to him, the more I discovered his rich experience. When he saw the special feature "Introducing the Children's Friend of Shen Bao," he immediately said, "I've already read the Children's Friend." When talking about Mr. Tao Xingzhi, he said, "Our teacher is Mr. Tao's student, so I propose to call Mr. Tao 'Grand Teacher.'" He is really good—when talking about singing, he said, "I have collected many children's national salvation songs and plan to compile them into a single book so that children in Hong Kong and Nanyang can sing them"! A thirteen-year-old child has the grand ambition of compiling a song collection, which is truly "a young man is to be feared."

But the training of life made his answers "precocious." When asked about his past experiences, he described how Wang Jingwei gave a speech in Suiyuan saying, "We have reached the final juncture..." and then criticized him for becoming a traitor.

He talked with great enthusiasm about how Chairman Chiang smiled at them when he inspected the National Salvation Work Team on Double Ten Day, how Mr. Guo Ruomo lectured them, how Mr. Tao Xingzhi loved them, how interesting it was when they were together, and even criticized Mr. Tao's poems for being like Mr. Feng Yuxiang's... He talked about these things as if they were his own treasures.

At a welcome meeting, when Mr. Jin Shan introduced him to Mr. Jin Zhonghua, he immediately said, "Ah! I saw your article and your map in some book." He could also accurately name the predecessor of the publication "Total War of Resistance" edited by Mr. Zou Taofen. At the welcome meeting of the Young Journalists Association, he reported his hopes of going abroad, and everyone praised the child's extraordinary qualities. He spoke skillfully and appropriately when asking the gentlemen to guide him—he was innocent and lively, winning everyone's applause.

The reporter asked him, "What work do you do in the China National Salvation Drama Troupe now?" "I do children's work. There are adults to do work for adults." How do you carry out the work? He talked about reporting on the situation of the children's movement, making children believe in themselves, and helping to organize... These were all based on his experience. In the troupe, his work was unique, even though he was a child.

A great era and a great environment have trained such an outstanding child, such a capable young warrior. This is precisely the symbol of the nation's rebirth and the country's bright future!

### The Counterattack on Zengcheng Takes a Sudden Turn - Our Army Captures Zengcheng - We Have Crossed the Zeng River and Entered Shitan, Heading Straight for the City Walls - Enemy Surrounded on All Sides, Fights Like Cornered Beasts, Is Defeated

(Dongjiang Express News) The military progress of the Dongjiang counterattack is rapid, beyond the enemy's expectations. After surrounding Zengcheng and completing the inner line encirclement, we have begun attacking the city walls. News was reported yesterday. It is understood that our army's encirclement of Zengcheng is relentless, with morale soaring. Guangzhou's outer regiment of the enemy is significantly restrained by this route. The following are more detailed battle conditions obtained here:

Our Army Entered Zengcheng This Afternoon

A Central News Agency dispatch from Wengyuan at 12:20 PM on the 14th: A phone call from the front reports that our troops counterattacking Zengcheng have entered Zengcheng. The enemy has only left a small force to defend the city streets, engaging in fierce street fighting with our advance plainclothes teams. A large fire has broken out in the prosperous areas of the city, with flames reaching the sky, visible from miles away.

Besieged City - Enemy Feels Isolated and Endangered

Our troops counterattacking Zengcheng this time are a joint force of the Ninth and Twelfth Army Groups. The eastern route is comprised of the Wei, Liu, and Chen units under the command of General Ou. The northern route is the Huang Liang division under the left wing of the Twelfth Army Group. Another route is the Chi Zhongkuan unit, commander of the Dongjiang south bank, which secretly crossed the Zeng River from Gouzaitan and infiltrated Shitan and Xiancun, cooperating with the Shan Rongpei unit. After recapturing Zhuguling, Shetouling, Jiaoshiguling, Pengwu, and other places on the morning of the 13th, the inner encirclement was completed. At 6:00 PM that afternoon, our army, using the dangerous barriers in the suburbs and the cover of new artillery, began attacking the city walls with mobile tactics. By the evening of the 13th and the morning of the 14th, our vanguard had reached the outside of the northeast gate. Zengcheng was besieged. The enemy troops inside the city felt isolated and endangered.

Several Breakout Attempts - All Defeated

According to the enemy inside the city, they were surrounded on all sides and extremely panicked. In order to escape, they stubbornly defended the city walls and fought like cornered beasts, using mechanized units and steel cannons as cover to break out of the northeast city gates, hoping to break our encirclement. Their attack was fierce, but our soldiers fought bravely, and our defense lines were strong. Although the enemy charged repeatedly, they were repeatedly repelled. Our defenders maintained their positions and fought calmly. This offensive and defensive war was extremely fierce, unprecedented on the eastern front. The number of enemy troops annihilated was also the largest in this battle. As of the morning of the 14th, over 400 enemy troops had been killed or wounded, three enemy tanks had been destroyed, and countless guns and ammunition had been captured.

Guangdong Enemy Reinforcements - Attempt to Lift the Siege

According to intelligence, Guangzhou's enemy commander Ando, after learning that our army had surrounded Zengcheng, sent a mixed force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery of 400 to 500 men, along with five tanks, on the night of the 13th, heading east along the suburbs to lift the siege of Zengcheng. On the morning of the 14th, they approached our army's警戒 line. Our army concentrated artillery fire to迎击 the attacking enemy. The enemy stubbornly defending the city also fired artillery in support, resulting in a fierce artillery battle. The sound of artillery fire could be heard from the 13th evening to the 14th morning in the areas of Jutou, Qishi, and Qiaotou along the Dongjiang River. The intensity of the battle can be imagined. Furthermore, villagers from Huatouling, Huixi, and other places in the suburbs of Zengcheng, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifice, fled east along the Bozeng Highway starting on the 13th.

### Our Northern Route Army Advances Southward - We Head Straight for the Chantan Highway - The Enemy's Outer Perimeter of Foshan Has Been Broken - Civilians Joining the Ranks, Morale Soars

[Huaxian Correspondence] The counterattack of our northern route army has been victorious in recent days. The various units on the front line have captured important strongholds and are advancing towards the suburbs of Guangzhou. Huaxian, located north of the provincial capital, has been the site of fierce fighting between our troops and the enemy for the past ten days. Civilians in our occupied areas are assisting regular troops in fighting the enemy, and the battle situation is improving daily. The following is a report on the situation of our and enemy forces in Huaxian in recent days:

Li Zhen's Unit Advances to the Chantan Line

The Li Zhen unit of the 12th Army Group’s XX Division, originally stationed in the downstream of Xiaobei River, in Qīngyuǎn, Shijiao, and the Chibaini area of Huaxian, has recently moved south to control the enemy in Tanbu, Fengyong, and Wuhe along the Chantan line. They have reached their destinations and infiltrated Fengyong, Jinshan Temple, Dawo Guanyao, and Tanbu. Since the 9th, they have been fiercely fighting the enemy along the Chantan line with the Deng Longguang unit and the tax police regiment, which crossed the Xijiang River to counterattack. They once recaptured Fengyong, Jinxi, and other places, capturing many enemies. However, the enemy in Foshan, fearing that their outer perimeter would be broken through by us, reinforced their defenses along the Chantan Road on the 10th and 11th, stubbornly resisting our counterattacking forces. The battle is still ongoing. On the 12th and 13th, our troops fought fiercely in Baisha Bridge, Shanggang, and Fenghongling near Guanyao. Both our troops and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. Li Zhen's division, in order to ensure victory, has secretly ordered XX and other regiments to rush to the front line to join the battle.

Huaxian's Guerrilla Force Active

The civilians in various villages and towns of Huaxian have been under the control of the enemy for several months, but they are devoted to the motherland. Many have spontaneously joined the guerrilla force. In addition, Wu Guanqui and Peng Linsheng, commanders of the Second District Guerrilla Column, have continuously sent political training personnel to various villages and towns in Huaxian to promote and mobilize extensive guerrilla warfare, further arousing their morale. It is now understood that the Huaxian guerrilla force has branches such as Huang Ruiliang and Huang Qiliang, cooperating with the Yan Jian unit of the Special Task Force and the Zhong Qi unit, with approximately XX personnel in total. They are strong and are distributed along the Chantan, Yuehan, Guanghua, and Chonghua lines to attack the enemy, which is extremely active. In recent days, our army's counterattack has achieved unprecedented victories. The guerrilla force and the civilians have greatly contributed to disrupting transportation, roads, and telephone lines, and restraining the enemy's communication and reinforcements.

Tanbu Has Been Controlled By Our Army

Also, according to military sources, since our army's counterattack from the west road on the evening of the 5th recaptured Sanjiang and Guanyao, the enemy's communication along the Chantan Highway has been interrupted. The enemy stationed in Tanbu and other places in the northern section of Chantan Highway has been surrounded and controlled by our army and has become a sitting duck. It is understood that the enemy troops stationed in Tanbu are only a few hundred in number, and their strength is weak. Therefore, they can only step up their defenses, dig deep trenches, and stubbornly defend their positions. On the morning of the 13th, Li's division dispatched a unit to attack the enemy in Tanbu. A certain company of our troops broke into Tanbu and engaged in bloody hand-to-hand combat. The enemy's heavy artillery and mechanization lost their effectiveness. Our army advanced bravely, killing many enemies. The enemy's morale wavered, so they dispatched several aircraft to bomb our positions. Due to the terrain, our troops automatically retreated to their original positions and continued to monitor the enemy.

### Completing War Preparation: Shantou Evacuates Population; Civil Servants' Families Given Three Days to Evacuate

[Shantou Express] Recently, the entire military situation is rapidly advancing. In order to allow the populace to avoid the danger of air raids, and to reduce unnecessary sacrifices in the event of war, the local authorities convened leaders of various city groups on the 11th to discuss evacuation standards. For the sake of swift implementation, the authorities issued a special order yesterday, the 12th, requiring all civil servants' families to complete evacuation within three days, as an example for the populace to follow. As for the plan to evacuate material resources, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also convened various trade associations to discuss it, and various steps have been decided upon.

### A Glimpse of Guangzhou's Terror: Bandits Kill and Rob in Broad Daylight

Since the × people occupied Guangzhou, the area has remained in a deathly quiet state for months. Although local shipping to Hong Kong has resumed, the number of people returning to Hong Kong from there each month far exceeds the number going from Hong Kong to there. Those who previously ventured there, mistakenly believing rumors, are now regretting their decision and are trying to leave, but it's not easy to obtain an "exit permit," forcing them to remain there in a very difficult situation. According to a notice posted yesterday by Jardine Matheson, the local army prohibits not only military supplies but also mail from being brought in. Furthermore, according to yesterday's South China Morning Post, an English newspaper in Hong Kong, it is very dangerous for those who carry large amounts of silver to go to Guangzhou, as they are easily suspected of having other motives. When the Foshan steamer recently arrived there, a large contingent of × troops boarded the ship and conducted a thorough search lasting two hours, causing great disturbance. In front of the ruins of the Southwest Restaurant in Xia Jiu Lu, a guerrilla fighter severely punished bandits in broad daylight. The × army was helpless. On that day, eight people (the eight people were guerrilla fighters) were traveling in a handcart when they were suddenly confronted by five bandits. Three of them, holding pistols, stopped them and ordered them to get out of the cart to be searched, or they would open fire. One of the passengers pretended to take out his wallet but suddenly drew two pistols and shouted at the bandits not to move. The other seven people also drew pistols and ordered the bandits to disarm. The bandits immediately threw down their weapons and fled. Later, two × soldiers heard the news and rushed to the scene, but they were also disarmed by the brave men. This shows a glimpse of the chaotic situation there.

### Excellent War Situation in Western Guangdong: × Retreating Offshore; Xinhui and Jiangmen Encircled; × Ships Shelling Mawei to Probe

[Zhongshan Express] In the recent battles on the Xinhui and Ningyang lines, we have made great progress. In Zhongshan and Shunde, although the × occasionally harassed, they were all defeated by our guerrilla teams. Yesterday's situation in various places is recorded below:

Jiangmen and Xinhui: × Taking a Defensive Posture

The war situation in the two strongholds of Xinhui and Jiangmen has completely turned for the better in recent days. The × army has been encircled. Although the × have reinforced several times, it has been of no avail. It was found that yesterday, the 13th, the × again used shallow-draft ships to transport more than 500 reinforcements from Daliang to reinforce the two strongholds of Huicheng and Jiangmen. Our troops, guarding Xiangshan, Wangyue Mountain, Daze near Huicheng, and the Jiangmen suburbs along the Jiang-Fo Highway, engaged in a fierce battle with the × for about three hours. The × suffered heavy casualties and turned to a defensive posture.

× Retreating Offshore: We Attacked Beijie

Our guerrilla team, taking advantage of the × army's withdrawal from Waihai, suddenly crossed the river from Guzhen when they entered on the afternoon of the 13th, taking the road through Waihai to attack Beijie, the East Fort, and the area south of the Menjiang River. The × army responded in haste and was attacked by our team, killing dozens of × soldiers and capturing more than ten rifles.

× Ships Harassing in Zhongshan County

The third, fifth, and ninth districts within Zhongshan have been unusually peaceful in recent days. Although the × occasionally intruded, they were all defeated by the Zhongshan garrison guerrilla team. Yesterday, the 13th, at about 3:00 PM, two × shallow-draft ships sailed from Yinggezui to Daliang, passing through Mawei Sha near Dahuangpu in the ninth district, and fired many shells at Mawei Sha. Our team calmly responded. After the × ships fired, seeing that we had no movement, they immediately sailed towards Daliang. It was also found that recently, there were four × ships anchored off Sanzao Island, two shallow-draft ships anchored off Dazhou, and × ships occasionally patrolling Tangzhou. There were no × ships in the Tangjiawan area.

### Guangdong Provincial Government Revitalizing the Countryside: Continuing Rural Loans; Second Phase of Loans Being Distributed; Special Agency Responsible for Handling

[Shaoguan Correspondence] The Central Government recently convened a national production conference and decided to start with agriculture first. It has issued orders to all provinces to take the opportunity to develop inland rural enterprises, vigorously promote various productions, and strive to enrich the resources for long-term resistance. It was found that Guangdong Provincial Chairman Li Han-hun, after receiving the order from the Central Government, once convened a conference of provincial agencies related to agriculture, and has made a whole decision on the inland agricultural production plan of this province. Recently, Chairman Li stated that the lack of finance in the current inland rural areas due to environmental influences is the biggest obstacle at present. For the sake of adjustment, it is planned to allocate funds to continue rural loans, and to restore the Rural Promotion Loan Committee of each county to be responsible for handling. The progress of each of these items is explored below:

Restoring Rural Loan Committees in Various Counties

It was found that the Rural Promotion Loan Committees in various counties of this province were established through the promotion of the Provincial Bank's Rural Loan Department, together with the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau and the Grain Committee, before the situation in Guangdong changed. The Provincial Bank borrowed two million yuan from the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Big Four Banks in installments and transferred them to the county cooperatives to adjust the rural economy. However, due to the outbreak of war in Guangdong Province, the loan affairs were virtually suspended. Chairman Li Han-hun now considers that it is necessary to take the opportunity to restore them in order to assist the countryside in the current situation in this province. He specially discussed with Gu Qun, the Director of the Finance Department and concurrently the Director of the Provincial Bank, and the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau to plan the restoration of the Rural Promotion Loan Committee in each county. Director Gu, upon receiving the instructions, has decided to establish a sound agency to be responsible for handling it. It is heard that in addition to co-organizing with the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, the Fourth War Zone Food Management Office will also be invited to participate and jointly establish the Provincial Wartime Rural Promotion Loan General Association. Before the establishment of the General Association, the County Rural Loan Associations will be restored first. Yesterday, the Provincial Bank's Rural Loan Department, together with the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, issued a notice to the counties, ordering them to prepare for the restoration as soon as possible.

Proceeding with Allocation of Loan Funds

Director Gu Qun, in order to expedite the work, has decided to contact the Big Four Banks of China to sign the second phase contract for the previously agreed two million yuan loan and continue to transfer the funds. It was found that the loan amount for the second phase contract is one million yuan, which can be signed and transferred in the short term after the negotiation is completed. According to a senior official of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, this province is continuing to prepare for the rural loan affairs, but due to the major changes in the inland rural areas, it is feared that one million yuan of loans will not be enough to distribute. It is now planned to ask the provincial government to find ways to allocate subsidies. As for the future loan methods, due to various difficult and changing circumstances, it is planned to re-determine them to adapt to the current situation. It is also heard that Director Gu plans to establish a Rural Loan Guidance Officer Training Class by the Provincial Bank's Rural Loan Department to train a large number of people to go to various counties to guide farmers in organizing cooperatives and handling loan work. The regulations of the training class have been handed over to the Rural Loan Department for planning and drafting, and preparations for training can be started as soon as various items are decided.

### Fujian Province Loans to Develop Inland Industry

[Quanzhou Correspondence] The Fujian Provincial authorities, in order to support the textile industry cooperation, recently established a medium-term loan method with the Cooperation Business Management Office of the Construction Department, the Provincial Bank, and the Agricultural Bank of China, raising 560,000 yuan of production capital, dedicated to the development of inland industrial production. Anyone who wants to engage in industrial production in the inland can apply to the office for loans to operate. As of now, five counties in northwestern Fujian have formed weaving production cooperatives. Recently, the Xijie production cooperative in Shunchang County has also been established, with more than 70 members and more than ten iron looms. All equipment has now been completed, and the Provincial Bank's loan of 5,000 yuan has also been approved for release. The first batch of loans of 3,000 yuan has been allocated by the cooperative office to Fuzhou for transportation and negotiation. The cooperative office, together with the general manager of the cooperative, Zhou Guanlan, purchased cotton yarn, dyes, etc. in Rongdong and transported them to Shunchang, which will soon begin weaving.

Film and Drama

### Soviet Film Industry Changes Style: Starts Producing Love Films; Happy People as the First Sound

The film industry occupies a very important position in the Soviet Union, but Soviet films are different from those in other countries. There are no glamorous, love, supernatural, or other films. They are all purely rigid historical and war films. Therefore, this can make the films help the progress of the Five-Year Plan and can also fulfill the duty of propaganda for Stalin. Therefore, most of the early Soviet films were current affairs and propaganda films. Since the start of the Second Five-Year Plan, the degree of cultural entertainment of the people has increased, and there have been films with subjects such as society and love as the theme. "Happy People," directed by Alexander Alexandrov, is the first shot of this kind of soft film.

Cartoons and color films are as naive as newborn children, and there are not many films. Some of the better ones are the color film "Circus" and the cartoon "New Garry." As for colorful cartoons like "Snow White," they have not been found so far.

The most famous historical film is "Peter the Great," which has been well received by people all over the world. The scale of this film is no less than the "Million Dollar Epic" of Hollywood.

"Thirteen Red Army Soldiers" and "Last Night" were produced to commemorate the great achievements of revolutionary soldiers. The plots and actors of these films are not bad, but unfortunately, there is no capable and lively director, so there are some shortcomings.

The famous film "Chapayev" is about a hero in the era of internal strife. This film is an outstanding work among sound films and broke the film record of the "Potemkin" era. Among the new films last year, the film that received the highest evaluation was "Lenin in October" directed by Romm. This film is a great epic that gathers the stars of the country.

Recently, Soviet films have gradually focused on the issue of national defense. Among the films produced, such as "One Day on the Border" and "For the Motherland," are all based on border disputes and espionage, to enhance the national defense concept of the people.

Currently, the film "Communist Youth City" is being produced, which depicts the lives of communist workers. This is nothing more than a propaganda film of communism. There is also a film based on a folk hero in the era of Imperial Russia. In this film, there is a scene of enemy troops retreating in embarrassment on a frozen river, and later the ice cracks and they drown. This is an unprecedented page in the history of Soviet film photography.

The Soviet government, in view of the lack of film talents and the bleak future of the film industry, recently established a film school in the suburbs of the capital, cultivating more than 2,000 talents, including stars, directors, film arrangers, and photographers. After graduation, the government guarantees them to work in film companies and also awards them honorary medals to encourage them to serve the country.

### Japan Forbids Young People from Watching Love Movies

[Haitong News Agency] Japanese Minister of Education Araki met with film experts yesterday to explain the new law passed by the government prohibiting young people from all over the country from watching love films. At the same time, the censorship organs banned films and leisurely games that were considered to have adverse effects. The law stipulates that the films that Japanese young people can watch are limited to those with cultural and artistic value. Finally, it is stipulated that in the future, when cinemas show films that young people are not allowed to watch, they must clearly state it in the advertisements, and at the same time, conspicuous notices must be posted at the entrance of the cinemas.

### Hot-Blooded Loyal Souls Showing in the United States: First Chinese Anti-Japanese War Film in New York; Authoritative American Film Magazine Gives Good Reviews

The "Hot-Blooded Loyal Souls" produced by China Film Production (the film has been screened in Chongqing and various places in Hong Kong) was recently shown at the Roosevelt Theater in New York. This is the first Chinese anti-Japanese war film to be publicly screened in the United States. The English translation of the film is "Resist to the End." Although the dialogue is in Chinese, because there are English subtitles, Chinese and foreign audiences can understand it.

This film not only shows the rapid progress of Chinese film technology, but also has greater significance, that is, it shows the enthusiasm and loyalty of the Chinese military and civilians to the Anti-Japanese War, so that friendly people who sympathize with China will have a better understanding after watching it.

After the film was released, all newspapers praised it unanimously, and the authoritative American film magazine "Variety Entertainment" also believed that "...this is a film that audiences who sympathize with the Chinese people like to watch. And many audiences who have never seen Chinese films with modern stories as their subject matter will have their wishes fulfilled because of this film... The story explains that China is resisting aggressors. It fully shows the great spirit of modern Chinese soldiers being loyal to the country... In any case, the performance can win the sympathy of the audience."

### Movie Novel (Continued): One Night of Joy (2)

After all the excitement and stimulation had subsided, his right hand, except for being a little stiff, was considered to have recovered. He thought that all this would not cause any difficulty in his life. His life was performance. Before, he had played the piano in a movie theater. When he enlisted in the army, he was performing in a carnival. This performance life, in his own opinion, although it may not necessarily shine with gold, at least it still has bright colors.

He can sing a few songs, he can dance a few dances, and he also has a seductive outline that makes women fall in love. However, now this occupation makes his head swell. Since he and Ms. Xiulika cooperated, the sentence "Halifan is free" has become his mantra. He took a long breath, stood up, and left his makeup table. He suddenly became surprised because he saw a girl leaning against the closed door. She walked gently into his dressing room, and he didn't even notice it.

The girl looked at him, and this kind of gaze caused Halili to feel a burst of annoyance. He used the usual attitude to deal with this kind of woman and said exaggeratedly, "Okay, what do you want me to do for you? If you want to sign a commemorative album, I'm very sorry, I have never learned to read and write."

The girl smiled and shook her head. Halili looked at her and felt that she looked pretty good. She had a head of red hair, shining with purple-copper light, and a pair of azure blue eyes, glistening and looking at him.

"I'm not here to ask you to sign your name, Mr. Fan," she said quickly, "I have something important to tell you."

"What's the matter, baby?"

"Can I sit down and talk?"

"To be honest, I'm not very happy. But, sit down wherever you like."

"Thank you." She took a cigarette from the ashtray on the makeup table. "Can I steal a cigarette from you?" She said, already lighting the cigarette with a match.

"Of course! As you please!" He Lileng said coldly. "And, if you have a bottle of champagne on hand, you might as well open it! Now, if you don't mind, I want to change clothes. What are you here to say?"

### The Final Moment of the Group A Football Championship: South China and Navy Compete for the Title; Held at the Navy Field at 4:30 PM This Afternoon; If South China Wins, Indirectly Creating Eastern's Position to Compete for Second Place

[Report from our newspaper] The Group A Football League has been calculating for many months, and South China, Navy, and Eastern have emerged as the top three on the standings.

The teams below Eastern have all played twenty games and have completed their mission. However, the second round game between Navy and South China has been postponed until today.

South China has played nineteen games, scoring thirty points, and Navy has also played nineteen games, scoring twenty-nine points. Therefore, due to the difference of one point, the importance of today's game has been created, as the final moment to compete for the championship.

We hope that the Chinese team can win the championship and create a glorious record. Therefore, we all wish South China victory in today's game, and don't let it end in failure.

If South China does not disappoint our expectations and completes the final victory, it will not only win the league championship, but also be enough to build a position to win the championship, and it will be more stable.

I think South China must win today. If they win, there are three points of significance. The first point is to win the league championship, taking the glorious heap of the younger brother (South China) and replacing it in the past, and no one else is allowed to ask about it. The second point is that if they can beat the Navy this time, then the third battle of the Xu and Cup at the end of the weekend can also be guaranteed, so today's game is a touchstone for winning the Xu and Cup. The third point is that when South China was embarrassed by the police a few days ago, just in time for the Eastern to also frustrate the Navy, South China was able to remain in a detached position, but don't forget Eastern's indirect help, and should have a way to repay the kindness. It is best to take today's opportunity to kill the Navy, which can not only win one's own glory, but also help Eastern to get out, because if the Navy loses, the points will be the same as Eastern, and there will be another runner-up final. Then, Eastern may also beat the Navy and jump to second place.

There is also one point, if our Chinese team wants to win the championship, they must defeat the Navy in a row, because of the six major championships, our Chinese team has already won two. The remaining three items are the league, the international competition, and the Xu and Cup. The championship issue of the league and the international competition will be resolved one after another today and tomorrow. But the most coincidental thing is that in the league and the Xu and Cup, our Chinese team has an encounter with the Navy for the championship, so there is no doubt that the Navy is the obstacle of our Chinese team, and the key to whether or not to win the championship is also the sea.

The Football Association originally wanted to hold this league championship battle earlier in this month, but it did not get the consent of the Navy. The Navy believed that holding it earlier was very unfavorable to its own team, because at the beginning of this month, there were still many warships going out to sea, and the strong players could not gather, so it was not until today that they met with South China. The ambition of the Navy can also be imagined.

A few days ago, the reporter investigated from the relevant aspects of the Navy and learned that the Navy's battle line was roughly determined, but it is not known whether there will be more hard work at that time. Looking closely at the military posts, most of them are Japanese people, and their names are very unfamiliar, so how their skills are is still a mystery and must be revealed after the war breaks out.

The old people are Hanyaweilu, Xuandi, Yanshi Delang, and Tuoban four, and their skills are good and have long been appreciated by general fans. As for the skills of the newcomers, I believe it must be good, because there are more than ten warships currently docked in Hong Kong. If they are not outstanding members, they will never be selected. Moreover, this battle is the life and death of the Navy. In addition to the determination to win, it is hopeless to lose, and a draw will not work. Since the battle is so important, the selection of people must also be painful, so there is a group of fans who think that the Navy has sent more new players to the battle, and the strength may not be strong. I am deeply happy for South China, but I feel that this point is absolutely not happy, but worried, because the Navy has more newcomers, and the truth is unknown. If their strength increases due to the use of more newcomers, then South China's victory may not be sure. I hope that the South China generals will be cautious.

According to what I have seen, although the Navy's left inner defender Xuandi's skills are good, he is not very stable. The right midfielder Hanyaweilu can only be loyal to his duties, but the position is not appropriate. The right winger Yanshi Delang is very agile, and his surgery is also accurate. The left inner Tuoban is good at running, but his shooting skills are not very good, but the Navy's forwards have always lacked the last kick.

However, the Navy can reach this position and compete with Nanfu for the title. They naturally have other strengths and are not fortunate to get this. As far as we know, although the Navy's strategy has no fixed way, the connection is what they value, the performance is advanced and retreated, and the forwards are often willing to attack, in order to make up for their lack of guards, so the South China guards should be wary of their sudden Wei attack.

Because Mai Shaohan is sick, there have been changes in South China's defense. Li Guowei was transferred to the left inner guard, and Guo Yingqi was the right midfielder. Guowei served in this position in the special silver medal final and performed well. With his quick feet, he will definitely be able to deal with the Navy's forwards today. But I hope to be careful. If he is sharp enough, there will be no problem. If he is too sharp, he may cause trouble. Yingqi is better at being a midfielder than a forward. He is also good at supplying passes, but Liu Qingcai seems to be unaccustomed to the steps when he is the right midfielder, and there are many flaws. If he is unaccustomed and not improved, he will cause trouble. It is best for him to switch with Yingqi, because Yingqi can be both left and right. The problem lies with Qingcai himself.

Bao Jiaping has seen good works since he returned to guard the door. He is an old hand. Today, he is still in love with him and takes on the important task. He is better than Zhang Rongcai, and the former "threshold" of the Zhejiang army is not precise. Jiaping will be able to cope with it easily. He doesn't need us. He is more talented in command. He can't be without him in an important game.

Regarding this championship battle, someone suggested to South China that it is best to invite Li Huitang to play, but Hui has already claimed that he will not participate in the league, and even if he is invited, he may not agree.

Several military divisions of the South China Football Department have carefully considered the front line to fight today. They finally dislike Li Enliang's new experience and lack of experience, so they decided to start the veteran Ye Beihua to fill the left inner forward. Three or four years ago, Beihua served in this position, and had a tacit cooperation with Feng Jingxiang. Later, due to foot injuries and working in the Guangdong Provincial Government, he stopped his activities in the stadium. He returned to Hong Kong from Shantou last month, and he was happy to see the wax and practiced again. He has already met with the fans in the star China and China United performance matches a few days ago. Now that South China needs talents on the front line, he will serve the mother club again. I believe he will be better than Enliang on the front line, and he is used to cooperating with Jingxiang. They sing and he agrees. He must receive a joint effect, and the front line is undoubtedly active.

When Beihua plays, the front line's strategy will focus on triangular short passes, with Jingxiang in the middle, taking care of both sides, with greater responsibility, but it is not easy to achieve results with only short passes. It is still necessary to see the opportunity to use the wings. The best policy is to be able to attack from all sides, and to encourage Luo Douwen to cheer up and not delay things, so as not to miss the fighter.

In short, South China's victory call is very high, and they must work hard to win. The great championship is none other than South China. The lineups of the two teams and the scores of each team are as follows (Ball Park Taisui)

### Port City Football Team to Macao Tomorrow Morning for Match Against Macao Team in the Afternoon

The Hong Kong port city football team to Macao is scheduled to take a boat to Macao tomorrow morning. At 3:30 PM, they will officially compete against the Macao port city team at the dog racing track. The Macao team is not weak and should not be underestimated, as no foreign team has ever won there. Last year, when the British Corinthian team visited Hankou, they only managed a draw. This year, the Philippine port city team and the Singapore Chinese team both returned defeated. Therefore, the Macao team has reason to be proud. The Hong Kong team for this competition consists mostly of young players from the First Division. Although they cannot be called the elite of Hong Kong, their fighting power is quite strong. Unfortunately, right-back Bill Byne (captain) cannot accompany the team due to a knee injury and will be replaced by Ha Xian. However, this should not significantly affect the team's strength. The Macao team's lineup is quite complete, with Jiang Shan Jing as the inside back and Gao La Su as the midfielder. The other players are also experienced and capable. The team lists for both sides are as follows:

(Macao Team)

### China Extremely Optimistic About This Year's Davis Cup Tennis Tournament; Xu, Cai, and He Will Compete Against the Great Powers

[External News] This year's Davis Cup International Tennis Championship, due to the East, shows ease and sends a team to join. China is unwilling to lag behind and actively participates. Most gratifyingly, the representatives are well-chosen, comprising Xu Chengji, Cai Huiquan, and He Renxuan, all currently studying in Europe and having participated in Wimbledon last year. Xu Chengji will be the first singles player, Cai Huiquan the second singles player, and He Renxuan will partner with Xu Chengji in doubles. This strong lineup is unprecedented for the Chinese tennis team. China has a bye in the first week, but in the second week, they will face France, with rising stars and veteran Bolo Wanra. If they can overcome this difficult hurdle, they will proceed to the third week and then the fourth week. This is because if they pass the second week, they will face England. Since Pan has changed professions, England lacks successors, and their strength has declined. Xu Chengji of China defeated Austin, a famous English player, 2-1 in the finals of the British Open Hard Court Tennis Championship. Therefore, if Xu meets Austin again, he is likely to win. Cai Huiquan has also won various championships in England. If they both perform well and win three singles matches, England will be defeated, and China's tennis reputation will be known worldwide. The schedules for the first and second weeks are translated below.

### Reporter's Special Holiday Association's Excursion to Lantau Island

The Phoenix Mountain trip organized by the Reporter's Special Holiday Association departed on time yesterday morning. Fifteen members and their relatives participated, including Guang Jun and two others from Queen's College. Arriving at Tung Chung around 7:00 AM, Mr. Situ Guang, the physical education director of Wah Ying College, greeted them at the riverside and led them to visit the school (formerly the site of the ancient city). They also attended the flag-raising ceremony held by the school's staff and students. The magnificent national emblem was hung high above the ancient city, creating a spectacular sight. Mr. Xie Zhili, the academic director, and professors Zheng Hemen, Lu Quanguang, and others warmly welcomed them and held a tea party. Due to its excellent environment, the school's students have achieved outstanding results in physical education. Around 10:00 AM, they began their ascent, taking two routes. Seven people went to Ang Ping via Di Tang Tsai, while eight went directly to Phoenix Mountain via Di Tang Tsai. The weather was cloudy and rainy, with thick fog covering the mountain. It was not suitable for climbing the peak, as even if they reached the top, they would not be able to see the surrounding scenery. However, Mr. Kuang and others were determined to reach the summit, and everyone was determined to get to their destination. After one hour and forty minutes of walking, they finally reached the peak, having traversed slippery roads and wet grass. They were all wet and exhausted. Due to the thick fog, they could not see more than a few feet in any direction. Considering the danger, they rested for a while and then returned to Tung Chung along the same route, unable to fulfill their original plan of descending from the peak to Ang Ping and then to Tai O to meet the other group. However, they had no choice. They swam and played soccer in the swimming pool of Wah Ying College in Tung Chung. Around 7:00 PM, they took a boat back, where they met the other group. Everyone said that the trip was enjoyable in its own way, both bitter and sweet.

### Southern Travel Notes

— Shi Li Hua

I departed from Xianggang on April 2nd. As soon as I boarded the ship, I knew that the Qing Yuan wheel needed to stop at Guangzhou Bay and Beihai. I asked the purser on board, and he replied that it would take five days at the earliest and six days at the latest. Who knew that we would arrive in Haiphong on the morning of the seventh, rush to Hanoi, and arrive in Hanoi at 4:45 PM. At 5:05 PM, we took the field in full gear. As expected, "success came immediately," winning the first game 4-1 and the second game 3-0, to the great delight and welcome of the overseas Chinese.

Of the 17 members of the team, many were not accustomed to sailing. At the first dinner on board, 11 people were present; at the second, there were 15; at the third, one; at the fourth, none; and at the fifth, seven. After that, we returned to the original state, with all 17 people present, laughing and talking, and eating heartily. This was because a strong wind blew from Guangzhou, causing the ship to pitch and roll violently. After Haikou, the wind was calm, like being on the Yangtze River. In terms of seasickness, Xu Wenkui was the worst, followed by Zhang Jinhai, Wu Qixiang, Zeng Zhongyun, Yu Qiaoyu, and Chen Bingtu. Sang Yu and I can say that we were the most resistant to the waves.

The goal-scoring records for the first two games, in simple terms, were:

Cao Qiuting three goals, Li Deqi two goals, Xu Wenkui and Zhang Jinhai one goal each.

But with the addition of Xu, Cao, and Zhang to the expedition team, the forward line was exceptionally strong, and the players had discussed their tactics on the ship, enabling them to understand each other tacitly. The low passes of the two inside forwards were considered by the Hanoi football community to be "not weaker than South China." Individually, the following assessments can be made:

Liu Xianhan was calm and composed, making timely saves. Miao Huaguo made strong clearances and was able to block the enemy's forward progress. Generally, he was considered better than Chu Yun, but Zhongyun was still as steady as before, but his footwork and speed seemed not as good as in the last two or three games in Hong Kong. Xu Jingcheng was still brave, shooting four times in the two games, hitting the target three times, but unfortunately, they were all palmed out. But the imposing manner of his running around the field seemed slightly less than when he was in Hong Kong, perhaps because he didn't need to work so hard. Luo Weiquan's position and distribution were good, performing at his peak. Wu Qixiang also made remarkable progress and ran powerfully. Xu Buyun is not a midfielder; he should be reassigned to inside defense next time.

On the forward line, Li Deqi was still the same, but commendably willing to work hard, and the two goals he scored were also good. Xu Wenkui's clever flick pass and his posture of jumping over people have been praised by the people of Hanoi. Zhang Jinhai worked hard and was well-positioned. Cao Qiuting was better in the first game than in the second; his footwork seemed better than Hou Chengtuo, but his speed was not as good. Chen Bingtu did not give an amazing performance in the two games due to a slight ankle injury, but he was one of the best in the last ten minutes of both games. Yu Qiaoxing could connect well with Xu and Zhang, but he was timid.

In terms of shooting technique, Wenkui should be considered the best and most admirable. His volley shot was extremely beautiful. Qiuting's shots were often difficult for the opposing goalkeeper to defend. Deqi's strange foot was resolute, and even he himself could not explain how he scored one of the goals in the third game.

In addition, Liu Xianhan let in one (not his fault, as he was facing three enemy forwards with no inside defense, and was helpless). Xian Weiquan lost a penalty kick (actually, it was not a bad kick, but the B team goalkeeper was brave and saved it into a corner kick).

The first game was against Junlian. This team was known for its burly physique, but lacked skill in shooting. The situation in the first half was quite balanced. The Eastern team began to show its edge in the last 15 minutes of the second half, quickly scoring two goals, perhaps because the Eastern team members had been traveling for a long time and had difficulty getting into top form.

In the second game against the B selection team, the opponent's defense adopted a "one-on-one" tactic, which was quite skillful and unusually brave. Their goalkeeper once saved a penalty kick and once ran to Cao Qiuting's heels to save a ball, both with beautiful leaps. The right inside back once made a flying header, his entire body straight and five feet off the ground, which was truly amazing. The weakness of this team was that the forwards were not good at using timing when shooting. Xianhan handled the situation with ease.

From the two games, the Eastern team was good at both attack and defense (in Hong Kong, they emphasized defense).

The originally scheduled game in Haiphong has now been canceled. Before the Eastern team arrived, Haiphong and Hanoi competed for the right to fight first. As a result, Hanoi defeated Haiphong 5-1 (Zeng Peifu was the Haiphong goalkeeper). Haiphong therefore withdrew from this invitational tournament. Mr. Zeng Peifu is now in contact and plans to play one more game after the Eastern team completes three games against Hanoi. Shunhua, the capital of Annam, is currently holding a triennial exhibition, and has sent a telegram inviting the Eastern team to perform a game. The date is currently being discussed. (According to a telegram from the Eastern team yesterday, they won 2-1). Saigon has also telegraphed through Hanoi to arrange a game, and they are currently discussing the date. It is likely that the Eastern team will return to Hong Kong in the first four or five days of the end of the month.

### The Scholar's Rebellion

— Xing Zai Tian

There is an old saying:

"The scholar's rebellion will never succeed in three years."

The so-called "never succeed in three years" does not mean that it will succeed in the fourth year, but that it will never succeed.

Examining the reasons for "the scholar's rebellion never succeeding in three years," first, it is probably because scholars are timid and suspicious, and are not enough to make long-term plans, cope with great difficulties, and create great undertakings. The so-called scholar, of course, is a soft-boned intellectual who comes from literature. History shows that most intellectuals in all eras are despicable, good at flattering masters and dignitaries, and siding with the rulers of the time. Most of these intellectuals are flag-wavers or secretly plotters. If you really give him a spear and let him break through the siege or capture enemy flags, the intellectual will definitely not do it. Not only will he not do it, but it can even be said that he dares not, because he is still attached to the world of fame and fortune and is willing to survive to serve another master with loyalty and enjoy the blessings of fame and fortune. The biggest reason why the scholar's rebellion cannot succeed is probably this.

Second, the scholar's words often do not match his heart. He does not speak honestly, but engages in sneaky behavior. However, in public, he makes grand pronouncements, speaking of high-sounding principles. There is no need to cite ancient examples; just take recent examples, such as the capitulationism advocated by the Wang clique. On the surface, they completely claimed that it was to save the country and the people, but in secret, they colluded with the public enemy of the Chinese nation, made agreements, and took money. They said on the outside that so-and-so was "martyred for the country," but how could they be "martyred for the country"? Words do not match actions, and most cases are like this.

If they had openly stated their actions and conditions for selling out the country, and publicly asked the people of the country to choose for themselves, and let the people of the country curse them, it would have been one thing. But they did not do that. Instead, they pretended to be loyal subjects planning for the country, secretly negotiated terms with the Japanese, and at the same time repeatedly said, "We have not taken any action!"

There is a passage in Chen Quanru's "Crazy Man's Words," Volume 1, discussing the reasons why strategists cannot succeed, saying:

"When the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked; when the enemy country is destroyed, the strategist dies. Since ancient times, there have been few who have escaped this fate. There is also a reason for this. Most strategists are not wise ministers who assist the king, but mediocre people who are good at using schemes and ingratiating themselves with the ruler. They may appear to be loyal to their ruler for a time, but their hearts are always deceitful and ugly. Not only are they ugly, but they are also feared."

The strategists mentioned in the passage are still those who are loyal to their country. Because of their "schemes and ingratiating themselves with the ruler," they aroused the distrust and suspicion of the ruler, and lost their lives. How much more so for those strategists who forget their country and surrender to the enemy?

Zheng Xiaoxu devoted half his life to serving the Japanese, and ended up being "cooked like a hunting dog." The fate of Wang is unimaginable. How much more so for surrenderers like Wang, who are cunning and fickle, change their allegiance in times of crisis, and shrink back in the face of adversity? They are the mediocre people who are more than capable of betrayal but incapable of building a nation. Although they can use "ingratiating themselves with the ruler" to please for a time, they will not ultimately escape the precedent of "when the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked."

There is another saying in "Crazy Man's Words," Volume 1:

"The bait of official rank can catch mediocre people, but not attract heroes. The boat of fame can carry flattering scholars, but not drown heroes." Wang's acceptance of four million gold notes twice shows that he is nothing more than a lecherous and greedy person, a crazy and contemptible person who has betrayed his ancestors. How can he taste the flavor of a puppet emperor? Therefore, the rebellion of the Wang clique, who act as accomplices for the enemy, can be called a scholar's rebellion.

### New Widows' Street (Continued)

— Zhuang Ruiyuan

No longer is there someone sitting on the chair, no longer is there someone leaning on the window, no longer is there someone sleeping in the bed, yet it is not as if the person is gone. That day, with trembling hands, she held the long-streamered flag, standing at the ×× post station, watching him go with a smile and tears. It was as if he were an ancient world-shaking hero, draped in armor, holding a long spear, galloping on a warhorse. Yes, historically, these conscripts have caused several famous massacres and famous lootings, setting fires. He should still be on the continent of East Asia, bravely wielding the poisonous fire with the timidity of a refugee talisman, engaging in bestial combat against humanity. Unintentionally, we turned our faces back from the escape route, only to see the tears of the arsonist.

The person in the photo only smiles and does not speak. Only smiles, yet can never stop smiling like that. Moreover, the person is reduced in size, becoming eight inches, placed in a frame, hung on the wall; even smaller. Becoming four inches, clipped in a book, kept in a pocket.

As if reminiscing about a hunted thief, she prays to the gods, wishing that he could return safely, which would be more than enough. Becoming rich through plunder or achieving fame at the cost of life is not important at all.

She goes to ×× Shrine...

I left the top corner of the newspaper and came to the lower end of the second page, which was a street. I came to this street. The center of the street was desolate, and the low houses along the street were lined up like silver. I only occasionally saw one or two open windows, with low-hanging bamboo curtains.

Ah! The New Widows' Street—

This is too slight a sound. It seems I hear it. I put aside the picture album in my hand and see myself still deeply seated in an old-fashioned circular chair. This is old furniture from my father's era. Following me, it also lives a wandering life. It is always contemplative and shares a part of its contemplation with me.

The sky is getting darker. The old clock still whispers tick-tock, and I know that soon, tomorrow, a delicate hand will snatch the peachwood pipe from the corner of my mouth, throw it into the fire to burn; my lighter will be taken to the kitchen, because we will have to cook for ourselves, and at least I will have to be at a banquet once, my cheeks flushed red,

because I am about to get engaged. Yes, isn't it good to settle down?

(The End)

### The Blood Wine of Life

— Mei Yibai

"Drink me the blood wine of life, return me with freedom and light."

I jump, I want to howl, I want to cry, no; I am going crazy.

The surroundings are pitch black, there is no daylight, no light, not even a star.

People say spring has come, but I don't see it. Is it covered by tall buildings? Is it frightened away by the gunfire? Maybe it's buried in the rubble. Ah! Where is spring?

I love freedom, but some people just won't let you be free. Do you want to hang the national flag? They will tell you to take it down. Do you love your country? Maybe someone will interfere with you. Ah! You are not free, do you know?

Look at the ghostly creatures, they laugh; they dance; they sell their souls, they sell everything. Everything revolves around you, darkness invades you, terror attacks you, and fame and fortune tempt you. Suffocating you, making you angry, making you disgusted.

This is an isolated island! No freedom, no light, you are not allowed to move, you can only be a person who is well-behaved.

Give me the blood wine of life, because I am too depressed.

### Leaving Songzhuang

— Li Qiao

Memories of the Breakthrough from Xuzhou

When retreating from Yuwang Mountain, the order said to retreat to Phoenix Mountain, Tortoise Head Mountain, and Suyang Mountain. Unexpectedly, after resting in Songzhuang for two days, another order came: retreat to Yunlong Mountain!

Where is Yunlong Mountain? It is said to be in Xuzhou. At that time, the × people had quietly sneaked between Mengcheng and Yongcheng onto the Suihai Road, blown up the Huangkou Iron Bridge, and were encircling Xuzhou...

But we didn't believe that Xuzhou would be lost. When we transferred from Pinghan Road to Longhai Road and passed through Xuzhou to Taierzhuang, we only casually glanced at Xuzhou before hastily parting ways. Now, hearing the order to retreat to Yunlong Mountain, we were all very happy, because we could go to Xuzhou again. But at the same time, we felt a bit sad. This much land, this much wheat, was going to be trampled by the iron hooves of the × people.

With infinite reluctance, one night, while the people of Songzhuang were sound asleep, we quietly left Songzhuang and set off for Xuzhou.

People, one after another, walked urgently. The cavalry, comfortable, riding on their strong horses, half-ran to the front. The heavy artillery, pulled by eight large mules, rolled slowly at the rear of the column. The horrible yellow dust drilled into people's nostrils and mouths, making people feel a bit suffocated.

The trucks carrying military supplies came rumbling from behind. The strong lights made people dare not turn around to look at them. They could only stand on the side of the road to let them pass, then blend into the dust and catch up with the column ahead.

The sky was dotted with countless bright stars, and the earth was so dark and deep. The boundless field of wheat, which had been caressed by the breeze during the day, swaying lively in the fields, had been swallowed by darkness. The trees appeared as dark shadows, standing like giants. The night wind, carrying a bit of coldness, blew towards people from time to time, making people feel a bit cold!

The villages in the distance often attracted bursts of dog barking due to the sound of people's footsteps. Apart from that, there was not a sound. Everything was so quiet.

The endless column, like a black current, flowed silently in the vast wilderness to the north, without stopping, as if they were all iron-cast men and horses, never tiring.

At dawn, to avoid the × people's planes, we stopped in a small village called Huangguang, with only four or five families, but the people had already run away. At dusk, the column continued forward along the highway covered with three or four inches of yellow dust.

Bang! Bang!... Suddenly, a clear burst of gunfire came from the front, followed by more and more dense fire. In the chaotic gunfire, the cannon sounds also rang out loudly. Soon, a red light floated up in front, illuminating the sky so red.

"What's going on?"

"Probably in contact with the × people!"

But it didn't seem like contact with the × people at all. The column was not afraid at all and continued to advance. Bullets whizzed past their sides.

Boom! Suddenly, a red light like lightning, followed by a startling explosion, lit up, illuminating the villages nearby, which had been shrouded in darkness, so clearly. This made us exclaim in surprise, and involuntarily quickly lowered our heads:

"What's going on?"

No one knew. Everyone walked mechanically with a tense heart, but soon a message came from the front: this was a friendly army obeying orders to retreat, and had automatically burned the military supplies that could not be taken away at the Daxujia Station on the Longhai Road. Although this was unavoidable, although it destroyed the Longhai Road, preventing the × army from advancing along the railway line from Pixian southward, we all felt an unspeakable heartache when we thought that the bullets bought with the blood of the people could not be fired into the chests of the × people one by one!

Some cars that had broken down somewhere were abandoned by the roadside and no one cared. Horses and cattle that had been exhausted from dragging military supplies lay on the highway covered in yellow dust, making people feel a sense of desolation. Even the horses and cattle were dead from walking, could our two feet withstand it? But after all, we are not horses and cattle, walk! walk! walk!

Walking non-stop, eyes that hadn't slept for two nights were as if something was pressing on the eyelids, and the eyelids just wanted to close from time to time, and the head was so dizzy, it was already in a state of semi-sleep, but our minds were clear, we were still vigilant.

As the east spit out a hazy dawn, we finally arrived at the camp—Tongcun.

### Traveler in the Desert

— Liu You

This is not a remote mountain wilderness, nor is it a vast ocean. This is a vast expanse of land, a vast desert of countless yellow sands piled up.

Thousands of miles, tens of thousands of miles, no way to be seen, no end to be seen, what is seen is the cloudy sky, the boundless sand, no lovely pleasing green, no exuberant vitality.

All year round it is so quiet, without a trace of human habitation, unbearably desolate, this desert prevents people from going forward, like a towering mountain soaring into the clouds, cannot be walked past, cannot be jumped past, nor can it be crossed!

Crossing a large river, crossing a vast sea, does not require any strength, but crossing this vast desert requires great perseverance!

In the desert, no one dares to venture deep: only those fighting heroes, and their faithful companion - the camel, with a spirit of transcendence, cross this desolate world!

No sunlight, no water, and no place to rest, only hard forward progress, enduring hunger and thirst!

That whirlwind, rolled up the sand, causing travelers to lose their way, but this does not give them any fear, they stopped for a moment, cheered up, and moved forward again!

Vast expanse, after endless time, has not yet reached the destination, but they will not be discouraged, still slowly moving, they know: one day, they will jump out of the death-like world, embarking on the "success" of the way!

### Manchurian Snow

— Shuqun

To weaken the sound of the gunshot and avoid accidents, he had to hold the gun against her chest or back; this action could be completed instantly with just a slight movement of the hand. Who knew that such a small action would be such a difficult task?

"Ah, using my body to exchange for money... Humph..."

She couldn't say the words.

To save oneself from death, people sometimes waver in their resolve. Especially her—a weakling. But she wasn't completely like that. On one hand, she was reluctant to give up her life, and on the other hand, she was moved by him, his voice, his movements, his vague posture; unfortunately, it wasn't in daylight or in a place with lights, otherwise, there would also be his face—the outer appearance of his heart, so that she could grab the hand holding the gun earlier and say softly:

"Put it away!"

She had subdued him.

An unexpected beginning, and an unexpected end.

At this time, he was lost in the sudden change, opening his arms, angrily embracing her, but afraid of violating the limits of the dignity maintained by that woman; so his arms were only moving in space, unable to find a place to rest on her body.

At the same time, she looked at his restless hands, as if moving and stretching congealed blood in the air, and she asked:

"Are you cold?"

"No, my hands are too hot."
