### Expectations for the Fifth Plenary Session

The Fifth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, abbreviated as the Fifth Plenary Session, according to news from the occupied territories, has been confirmed to open on the 20th of this month in Chongqing, only five days from now. According to the General Regulations of the Nationalist Party, the Central Committee Plenary Session is the most important body within the Party, second only to the National Congress. It is convened every six months, and its location must be the same as that of the central government. Its importance in nature and authority does not need to be elaborated. Moreover, the affairs of the state and the governance of the party are not limited to the internal affairs of a single party. For nearly twenty years, the major plans of the Party and the state have originated here. Especially in extraordinary times, with the War of Resistance and national reconstruction involving countless matters, looking ahead and behind, carrying on the past and opening up the future, matters await exploration or vigorous implementation, each concerning the future of the Party and the nation. Therefore, this Fifth Plenary Session is certainly not comparable to the routine meetings held every six months in the past. The agenda and proceedings of the Fifth Plenary Session are inaccessible to outsiders. Even the most important topics to be decided are not like those of previous plenary sessions, where the resolutions of the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee could be glimpsed in advance. Since the main issues have not been disclosed to this day, reporters have no way to comment on specific matters. However, there are some situations that we deeply feel uneasy about on a regular basis, and we would like to present them briefly. The foolish thoughts of a thousand men may contain one valuable insight!

Since the Nationalist Party adopted the system of a Director-General based on the decision of last year's Provisional National Congress, there has been unanimous praise from both inside and outside the Party. It is believed that power will be concentrated from now on, and will unified, and that the strength of the organization will presage rapid progress in accomplishments. However, as time passes, there is not much visible progress. This is because during wartime, military affairs are the priority, and the Party does not have the time to devote its full strength to Party affairs. Even if some efforts are made, although the achievements are significant, they are overshadowed by the war and not fully known to everyone. This is due to both subjective and objective factors, and naturally the achievements cannot meet expectations. In the future, as the overall situation enters a critical stage, we should still recognize the priorities and not demand perfection. However, the Central Committee members should not be too lenient with themselves. The status of the original Central Committee members within the Party is not diminished by the system of a Director-General. Their service in Party and government affairs or in society is not reduced to that of subordinates because military affairs are the priority during wartime. Moreover, in terms of appropriate self-respect and a sense of responsibility to the world, they should possess the spirit of a Director-General and be a hundred or a thousand times more self-conscious in their diligence and self-improvement than ordinary Party members and the people, towards the Party, the country, the society, and even the duties they hold. It is hoped that besides the Director-General being sincerely admired by the whole country and regarded as the sole leader, the Central Committee members will also demonstrate their extraordinary qualities to ordinary Party members and the people in various spiritual aspects. It must be understood that the ability of any organization to maintain immortality lies in the formation of excellent traditions by the core members, and it cannot forever rely on any single individual. The Nationalist Party has a Director-General, but the Central Committee members, who are the core members, still have much to strive for. It is believed that the political future of the Nationalist Party depends entirely on how the Central Committee members create and complete an unshakeable foundation for the Party. If the core members are inferior to others, then the future will be inferior to others. The worry lies in oneself, not in others. The people have particularly high expectations for the Nationalist Party, and the Nationalist Party should urgently have practical achievements that meet the people's high expectations. This is the first point. The Nationalist Party has always established the Party and the nation with a revolutionary spirit, but in the last decade, the revolutionary spirit has gradually waned. Leaving aside matters concerning national policy, in terms of the Party, such as planning the Party's internal organization, promoting and implementing the Party's doctrines and policies, sanctioning all Party discipline within the Party, and selecting candidates for central and local officials at all levels, the revolutionary spirit is often found to be not thorough. Often, it starts with great fanfare and overwhelming force, but ends up being buried in ambiguity. In terms of sentiments and considerations, there must be unavoidable difficulties that are understood by the Party. However, the perceptions and influences, as well as the inadequacy of the effects and functions, may not be fully understood by the people. In the final analysis, the problems are not uniform, and there is no need to list them all. However, maintaining an open and impartial attitude, removing unnecessary entanglements and constraints, and developing and enhancing the original revolutionary spirit are the fundamental ways to cure the problems. This is the second point. This war of resistance has, in various aspects, internally and externally, for the nation, demonstrated the significance of innovation and reform. Even social undertakings and the establishment of careers for any individual will undergo severe tests and generate strong changes due to the war of resistance. This is an inevitable trend that is difficult to avoid. It is expected that the outstanding will obtain reasonable development, while the corrupt will be eliminated. If more human intervention is added, the final outcome may not fundamentally violate the trend, but the transitional phenomena created will vary greatly depending on whether the intervention is appropriate. In response to this great dynamic, those who plan for the country should have a clear understanding and guide it accordingly. In other words, efforts should be made to ensure that all reforms, successes, failures, rises, falls, benefits, and detriments are extremely fair, extremely economical, and extremely clear. Proper effort can shorten the process of completing the great task of national reconstruction; otherwise, it will only increase obstacles. The impact of this is far-reaching and indescribable, but starting from the basics, everything begins now. Therefore, planning for the Party and the nation now must at least involve reviewing and eliminating the unfair, uneconomical, and unclear aspects of implementation, both in terms of people and matters, and striving for ruthless elimination. Only with ruthless elimination can reasonable methods be obtained. This is the third point. Will the Fifth Plenary Session pay attention to these three points?

### General Situation of the War of Resistance in North China and Estimation of Future Situation (II)

— Peng Dehuai's speech at Mingfengji

(Continued from yesterday's page six)

If we do not pay attention to and strive to mobilize and organize these female compatriots who make up half of our nation, the loss of this great force will be a regrettable matter. Moreover, failing to attract this great force to the anti-Japanese front will not only be a loss for our national liberation against Japan, but will also add many unnecessary difficulties to the war of resistance. Mobilizing military service is a very obvious example. If women can be organized, publicized, and educated so that they understand that if the War of Resistance against Japan is not victorious, they will be permanently oppressed and ××, it is necessary to remind them to encourage their husbands and sons to enlist and participate in various anti-Japanese work, and to help the army and the government in the war of resistance. This principle is very simple and obvious, but today there are indeed still people who hold inaccurate views, despise women, and regard women as "goods." In fact, it must be known that if half of the population is not liberated, even if the War of Resistance is victorious, the liberation of the Chinese nation cannot be considered truly complete.

(II) The center of women's work:

Is still to take resistance against Japan as the first priority. Only with national liberation can women's personal demands and liberation be fought for. Only by grasping the center of resistance against Japan can the actual interests of women themselves be obtained. However, this does not mean ignoring women's personal urgent demands, but rather that the liberation of women and national liberation are on the same path.

(III) Women's active performance in the war of resistance:

Women in the War of Resistance in North China have heroic and magnificent deeds, giving a serious blow to those who advocate that women "go to the family" and "return to the kitchen."

In the special environment of North China, wounded soldiers cannot be concentrated and are mostly scattered in farmers' homes. Women's love for the wounded soldiers is truly meticulous. They take the eggs they have saved up by exchanging oil and salt and send them to the wounded soldiers to eat, while they themselves are willing not to eat oil or salt. Everyone should not think that an egg is not a big deal, but a peasant woman regards eggs as very precious. The fact that they are willing to take out their eggs and give them to the wounded soldiers is so touching. Secondly, they encourage their husbands and sons to go to the anti-Japanese motorcade to become soldiers, make shoes, socks, and gloves to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers, spin yarn, weave cloth, sew military uniforms, supply the army, and participate in agricultural production, plowing fields and harvesting wheat, all of which they strive to do. The large increase in food production in North China last year owes much to the efforts of women. In particular, mobilizing military service and strengthening the replenishment of troops is truly a major event. The merits of women that are worthy of commendation.

(IV) Experience of women's work:

(a) Taking resistance against Japan as the center, everything is for resistance against Japan, and everything is subordinate to resistance against Japan.

(b) First absorb enlightened women from families with good conduct and intellectuals, train them, and educate them, but attention must be paid to the special habits of the Chinese nation's history to avoid hindering the work.

(c) After training, returning home to the countryside does not mean provoking the consciousness of women's resistance, but rather playing an active exemplary role in all aspects, influencing men and children to make them progress, and arousing the admiration of neighbors, villagers, family members, and raising the status of women. Therefore, in many places in North China today, Xuanzi have been elected as village chiefs and district chiefs to participate in political activities.

(d) Cultivating women's ability to work and improving women's knowledge, not being arrogant, having a peaceful attitude, not only doing the hard work of women, but also doing the work of backward men. Only in this way can the bad habit of belittling women be broken.

(E) Anti-Japanese work for children:

(1) Children's national salvation organizations are quite common in North China, in the Jin-Ji-Cha Border Region, west of Pinghan, and south of Zhengtai.

(2) Educating children, raising national consciousness, doing anti-Japanese work, raising cultural level, mobilizing literate children to help illiterate people, participating in singing and speech activities, and promoting the war of resistance.

(3) The work undertaken by children, in addition to propaganda and education, includes checking road passes, questioning pedestrians, detecting suspicious persons, comforting families of anti-Japanese soldiers, and cracking the conspiracies of traitors and Japanese to poison people. (In front of the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army, a child caught a traitor who was poisoning a well.)

(4) The children themselves have education and training, hold meetings to discuss, and self-criticize, so that they can be tempered into children of a new country of the Three People's Principles.

(F) Work for the families of anti-Japanese soldiers:.

Work for the families of anti-Japanese soldiers is very important, and in North China, special attention is also paid to this work.

(1) Organize "Anti-Japanese Soldiers' Families Committees," with one village or several neighboring villages as a unit, elect committee members, stipulate meeting times, once a week, so that they can communicate and discuss issues, solve the difficulties and needs of the families, conduct education and propaganda, and mobilize families to write letters to comfort the soldiers at the front and strive to fight.

(2) Raise the social and political status of the families of anti-Japanese soldiers, invite them to be chairmen at meetings and praise them among the masses, mobilize social groups to comfort and help them, give them encouragement in spirit, and provide concrete help in material terms, such as helping with farming, harvesting, lending money, county magistrates or other administrative officials, presenting "Glory" plaques, and personally visiting them to offer comfort.

(3) The families of anti-Japanese soldiers enjoy various "priorities," free tuition for their children, discounted purchases at cooperatives, and necessary economic support.

All of these are for the victory of the war and accurately and practically strike at the past notion that "good sons don't become soldiers, and good iron doesn't become nails."

(4) Conduct education for the families of anti-Japanese soldiers, so that they are not arrogant and play an exemplary role among the masses, gaining more care and help from the masses. At the same time, this education is not empty preaching, but rather organizing them, holding meetings for discussion and criticism, and having the masses educate the masses.

Only in this way can the cooperation between the military and the people be further strengthened, so that the people believe that the army is our army, and the army becomes the armed force of the people. Otherwise, empty slogans are ineffective.

(G) Propaganda and education work for the masses:

(1) The purpose of propaganda and education is, at a minimum, to raise the spirit of resistance against Japan.

(2) The teaching materials for propaganda and education can be the Three People's Principles, the Program for Resistance against Japan and National Reconstruction, President Chiang's important speeches, the concrete lessons of the eighteen months of resistance against Japan, and the heroic deeds in the war of resistance, all of which can be compiled into easy-to-understand teaching materials. Then, conduct arduous and planned work, educating them in various ways.

(3) The organization of education, in addition to general elementary schools, should take villages as units to organize women's literacy classes, poor people's literacy classes, or night schools, etc. Secondly, there are also villages as units to organize national salvation rooms, national revolution rooms, national revival rooms, etc., designating appropriate personnel to be responsible for leading the masses to hold discussions, report on the war situation in various places, and explain the stories and deeds of national heroes (such as the revolutionary deeds of Sun Yat-sen and how Zhang Yuefei and Qin Hui were different, etc.), organize anti-Japanese pictorials and intelligence, and provide the masses with learning opportunities at any time. In addition, you can also organize forums, organize intellectuals, discuss specific work, and conduct mass education.

(4) Education for backward elements is more difficult and requires patient guidance in order to win over the broad masses to the anti-Japanese front.

(H) Experiences in mass movement work:

(1) There must be extensive democracy in order to mobilize the masses and organize the masses. The affairs of the masses must be decided by the masses themselves. Those who lead the work must not forget this. They must listen to the opinions of the masses and help them, not "do everything for them," which hinders their self-awareness and sense of responsibility. If there is no such system and style, and everything is done by command, it will inevitably fail.

(2) Don't be satisfied with empty plans and calls. Planning is one thing, and realizing it among the masses is another. The distance between the two is still far. If you want the plan to become an actual action, you must work hard and do the mass work bit by bit patiently and deeply in order to achieve the goal.

(3) Understand the urgent demands of the masses and solve every specific problem for them. If actual problems can be solved, the mass work can naturally achieve success. Otherwise, empty promises that cannot be cashed will inevitably lead to failure.

(4) Pay attention to cultivating and promoting cadres from various social professional groups. Only these cadres can deeply understand their urgent demands, are suitable for their living habits, and can have close relationships. Otherwise, those appointed from above will be out of touch, and naturally the work cannot be successful.

(5) The cadres who do mass work, no matter what party or faction they belong to, must go deep into the masses, humbly learn from the masses, understand their specific problems, and stand in the ranks of the masses to lead the masses forward. If they are aloof and put on official airs, the result will definitely be failure.

The above sections are all about mass movement work. The reason why we talk about the masses first is that we believe that resistance against Japan and national reconstruction all depend on the masses. If we do not believe in the masses, despise the masses, and the way of working is not changed, then I can say with certainty that resistance against Japan will encounter more difficulties or even disadvantages. Today, mobilizing the masses and organizing the masses is entirely for the purpose of resisting Japan. To achieve the goal of winning the War of Resistance, we must mobilize the masses and organize the masses, which is the correct and reliable method.

B. Opposing traitors and fighting against the puppet troops.

Opposing traitors is to prevent Chinese from fighting Chinese, and disintegrating the puppet troops is to destroy the Japanese and weaken the Japanese.

A. The situation of traitors operating under the instigation of the Japanese.

(a) Carrying out pseudo-organizations under the guise of anti-Japanese slogans, such as the "×× National Salvation Army" and "Anti-Japanese Army." Because the masses have deep hatred for the Japanese, organizing the "Royal Collaboration Army" will inevitably be opposed by the masses. Therefore, they use the slogan of "resistance against Japan" to deceive people. When the masses are absorbed and organized, they claim to be "self-defense," and the slogan they put forward is "Japanese soldiers don't hit us, we don't hit Japanese soldiers." They also say, "Our army can't defeat Japanese soldiers, so we use self-defense. Japanese soldiers don't come, we don't fight Japanese soldiers." The latter are deceived by them and echo them. Then they go on to propose, "We don't let the Japanese come, and we don't let the Chinese soldiers come." In this way, the Japanese achieve their goal. Because of the deception of the traitors, it facilitates the insufficient distribution of the Japanese army's forces. Moreover, if the Chinese army comes, they will resist. This further achieves the Japanese goal of "Chinese fighting Chinese." The poisoning of their attempts to undermine the anti-Japanese determination of the masses and destroy the anti-Japanese forces in China is evident from this. In addition, there are also two brothers, one in the anti-Japanese army and one in the Royal Collaboration Army. If the anti-Japanese army wins, the older brother protects the younger brother, and if the resistance against Japan fails, the younger brother protects the older brother. Moreover, some traitors have been appointed by both the Chinese and Japanese sides and have both the Blue Sky White Sun flag and the Rising Sun flag. When the Japanese army comes, they raise the Rising Sun flag, and when the Chinese army comes, they raise the Blue Sky White Sun flag. These facts are exemplified by Yang Yukun in southern Hebei. It is very painful to hear, but in fact, these tricks can easily confuse the masses and deceive them.

(b) Using feudal superstitious organizations, such as the Red Spear Society, the Lu Yi Society, and the White Spear Society, all of which claim to be self-defense, but in fact help the Japanese.

(c) Recently, the Japanese in China have put forward the slogan of achieving overall peace through partial peace and compromise and signed non-aggression treaties with the masses to remedy the difficulty of insufficient troop distribution. They say that the Japanese army does not rob, does not rape, and does not burn houses, but the common people must also guarantee that the Central Army and the Eighth Route Army will not fight the Japanese army. Then they can use a small number of troops to guard a place (such as reducing a regiment to a platoon or a company.) At the same time, the Japanese have recently proposed the so-called "30% military, 70% political" to deceive backward people. Recently, they have even shamelessly put forward such slogans as "fight back to the motherland" and realize Sun Yat-sen's "Pan-Asianism."

(d) Sowing discord, undermining unity, spreading the atmosphere of peace, trying to eliminate the anti-resistance sentiments of our people, inciting and tempting the people to overthrow the anti-Japanese army. In many places, the puppet Royal Collaboration Army wears the Eighth Route Army's insignia, pastes slogans, establishes "Soviets," and implements land revolution and proletarian dictatorship to undermine the feelings between the Eighth Route Army and the people. Sometimes, when they meet the Central Army, they say that they only fight the Communist army and not the Central Army. When they meet the guerrillas, they say that they only fight the regular army and not the guerrillas. However, when they meet the regular army, they say that they only fight the guerrillas. The North China army and the people have generally gained a further understanding of these intrigues of the Japanese, but there are still a few people whose understanding is vague and need patient explanation.

B. Our Countermeasures

Since the Japanese are playing their tricks in this way and trying to undermine our war of resistance, then how should we deal with them?

(a) Raise the people's national self-esteem and confidence in the victory of the War of Resistance, as well as the perseverance to overcome difficulties. Indeed, we have reduced our national self-esteem and self-confidence under the aggression of imperialism in the past, insulting ourselves, saying things like "sick man of East Asia" and "inferior nation," thinking that we are not capable. In fact, our Chinese nation is an excellent nation in the world, with many excellent deeds worthy of praise to educate the people. The experience and lessons of the eighteen months of resistance against Japan are also sufficient to improve national self-confidence and enhance the perseverance to overcome difficulties. At the same time, we must be good at grasping every specific fact and exposing the conspiracies and sowing discord of the Japanese traitors to create hatred among the people for the Japanese traitors. In this way, we in North China can make the Japanese have nowhere to use their schemes. The orders of the provisional government in Beiping can only reach the vicinity of the Summer Palace, and in other places, they cannot be reached and are also ineffective. (To be continued)

### Western Shanxi Counties Recaptured One After Another, Our River Defense Strengthened, Invading Japanese Troops Cut Into Several Sections, Yumen Critical, Our Troops Cross the Fen River and Press Forward

[Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 15th] The Western Shanxi battle situation is being supported by reinforcements from the Datong-Puzhou Railway, traveling along various highways to western Fenhe, attempting a counter-offensive. Those invading Yumen from Hejin number about a thousand. Two or three hundred were killed by our forces, and fighting continues. The two-corner area of Jixian, Xiangning, Puxian, and Daning are all in our hands. Our guerrillas are also active everywhere on the highway from Puxian to Hejin, and on the highway to Xixian. Over a hundred Japanese troops in Guxian were annihilated by our forces. Our river defense has been strengthened.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 14th] Arriving late, our main force on the 11th and 12th successively captured Lishi, Zhongyang, and Ji County. The invading Japanese troops were cut into several sections. A part of them stubbornly resisted at Hejin, still attempting to invade Yumen. Japanese reinforcements also arrived east of Wucheng Town. Our forces are blocking them on one side and launching a multi-pronged siege on Linfen on the other. On the 13th, our vanguard troops had crossed the Fen River at Xinshicun, and a major battle is about to unfold.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 15th] In recent days, the Japanese troops on the western section of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway have been transporting troops frequently. A portion of the troops in southern Shanxi are being rotated. Near Boai, over a thousand Japanese troops

[Central News Agency, Sian, 14th] Military News: (1) The battle for Dongyemiao and its vicinity is extremely fierce. Our river-west artillery concentrated its firepower and fiercely bombarded the Japanese troops, killing many of them. Another unit of our forces has approached Guzhen and is pursuing forward. The Japanese troops are very panicked. In recent days, over a thousand Japanese troops have arrived at Xiamakou, attempting to cross the river and invade westward. We have made strict preparations. (2) Recently, our army attacked the Linfen railway station, and another unit attacked Hongdong, killing dozens of Japanese troops. The railway near the Gudongguanzhen area was destroyed by our raiding teams in three places. In recent days, traffic on the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway has been interrupted. Obstacles are being built in Sigou, west of the city, to prevent our army from attacking.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 15th] The Japanese troops entrenched in Yanglei (Qinyang) were fiercely counter-attacked by one of our regiments on the morning of the 10th. After a fierce battle until noon, the Japanese troops could not withstand it and fled back to Lishi in a panic via Xibaizhenzhu. They were intercepted by our forces at every turn along the way, and many were killed or captured.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 5th] Activities on all fronts of the Sino-Japanese War have become greatly active recently. The Chinese army in Shanxi is now attacking Linfen. The Chinese army near Hengyang is stepping up its encirclement of the city, making rapid progress. The Japanese army commander has sent an urgent telegram requesting reinforcements.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 14th] Over a thousand Japanese troops from Fengshan, Longpan, and Chongyi, east of Qinyang, invaded Daxian, Caocun, and Wangli in two directions on the 9th. One of our units fought bravely to respond. At noon, they used their main force to outflank from the flank, repelling the Japanese troops who had invaded eastern and western Wangli. Our forces are currently contacting the frontal troops to wipe out the Japanese troops. In addition, the Japanese troops in Xibaizhen, west of Qinyang, have suffered heavy losses from repeated attacks by our army and have mostly fled to Qinyang.

### The Tense Situation in Western Shanxi

— Special Chongqing Dispatch from Our Newspaper

Since the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, the battle situation in Central and Southern China has temporarily appeared quiet. The enemy, with its exhausted troops, has been blocked by us in Central China along the Yueyang-Tongcheng line, and confronted us in Southern China in areas such as Sanshui and Conghua, unable to advance for a long time. However, the enemy will not cease its military aggression. Therefore, after failing to advance in Central and Southern China, it has shifted its aggressive objectives to the Northwest as a priority.

The Northwest is an important base for us to conduct the War of Resistance in North China. For more than a year, the enemy has repeatedly attempted to cross the river to invade westward. However, due to our consolidated river defenses in eastern Shaanxi and the strong resistance of our troops in central Shanxi, the enemy's sweeping plans in southeastern Shanxi and Wutai have been shattered. Moreover, the enemy's attempt to cross the river to invade Shaanxi has also become a pipe dream.

However, although the enemy has suffered heavy blows, it has not abandoned its intention to cross the river. Not only has it not abandoned it, but also, due to the stability of our military in the two northern provinces, it is even more eager to accelerate the realization of its wild plan. Since the middle of last month, the enemy has concentrated a large army, totaling about 20,000 men, in the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, actively invading westward in five routes. One route, based on Fenyang and Xiaoyi, is advancing northward from Dui Jiugu and Maijiao, towards Shilou and Xinhedu, and southward towards Xixian. Another route, based on Linfen, is advancing from Shimenli and Longguan, invading Pu County and Daning. One route is invading westward from Xiangling, and also turning north towards Heilongguan. Another route, based on Quwo, Houma, and Xinjiang, is occupying Quanzhang, Sanquan, and other places, aiming to reach Yumen. One route, based on Hejin, is attacking Yumen with its main force. The enemy's main intention is clearly to use its main force to advance westward, hoping to find a crossing point to invade eastern Shaanxi.

Since the 2nd and 5th of last month, fierce battles have unfolded in the western Shanxi area. The enemy is trying to advance rapidly, and has successively captured Pu County, Daning, Xiangning, Ji County, Shilou, and other places. However, our army has long had strict deployments on both sides of the Yellow River. The Shanxi-Shaanxi front stretches for a thousand miles along the Yellow River, and we have also taken strict precautions at all important crossings. Therefore, it is difficult for the enemy to occupy Yumen and other places at once, but they have been given a head-on blow by our army, and we have recovered Chuowo, Shijiatan and other places in Yumen. At the same time, our extensive guerrilla forces are extremely active in western Shanxi, and the relationship between the army and the people is also very good. Although the enemy's adventurous westward invasion has temporarily succeeded, our army is using new strategies, not only focusing on blocking the front, but also paying more attention to flanking and severely attacking the enemy's rear and flanks. The enemy wants to accelerate its westward advance, while our army is flanking it from both the north and south, and at the same time using extensive guerrilla forces to cut off its rear lines of communication, making it unable to attend to both ends. If the enemy wants to advance, its rear will be attacked; if it wants to ensure the safety of its rear, it has to stop its advance. As a result, our army recovered Ji County and Daning on the 8th, annihilating more than 4,000 enemy troops, and recovered Pu County and Xiangning on the 10th, annihilating more than 3,000 enemy troops. At the same time, we took the opportunity to recover Wucheng Town and attacked Lishi Town, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy, which was in utter disarray. Judging from the current situation in western Shanxi, our army has clearly achieved a major victory. This victory is really due to the skillful cooperation between the regular army and the guerrilla forces, the widespread mobilization of the army and the people, the appropriate application of strategy, and the heroic fighting of our countless soldiers on the front lines.

However, we must never be arrogant because of the small victories we have achieved recently. The enemy's attack on western Shanxi is only a beginning. In the near future, the enemy will obviously intensify its offensive on the northwestern battlefield, and the situation in western Shanxi will inevitably become more tense. Because of this, it naturally increases our task of defending the Northwest.

To defend the Northwest, we must strengthen the defense of Shanxi. Shanxi is the vanguard of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, and it is an important pivot for the War of Resistance in North China. The reason why the enemy does not dare to risk crossing the river to invade westward is not because it does not have the power to cross the river, but because we still control a considerable amount of military force in Shanxi, which makes it have to be concerned. Therefore, to protect Shaanxi and Gansu in the west, we must strengthen the defense of Shanxi, strengthen the political work of the guerrilla forces behind the enemy, improve the relationship between the army and the people, and at the same time strengthen domestic unity. This is especially important in the Northwest.

### Madame Chiang's Candid Remarks: Denouncing Those Who Advocate Peace

[Reuter's Chongqing, 15th] Madame Chiang Kai-shek declared yesterday that China cannot and will not make peace with Japan. "I recently went to several front lines to inspect the situation. The soldiers and people on the front lines are prepared for hardship. I have not heard any indication that they are willing to make peace. Only far behind the front lines do some weaklings make suggestions for peace."

### Wu Zhihui Talks About Wang Jingwei: Blood Pressure Too High Can Easily Cause Mental Illness; Chamberlain Is Good at Tai Chi

[Special Chongqing Dispatch] At 3:30 PM on Sunday, January 8th, this reporter had just left the YMCA annual meeting when I saw an old man with a shiny head, wearing a felt hat, a long gown and a black mandarin jacket, and shoes with patched heels, looking around and walking slowly. One look told me that he was Mr. Wu Zhihui. Mr. Wu's talks are loved by the world, so this reporter could not easily let him go. I immediately turned around and followed closely behind, hoping to find an opportunity to talk with him.

Mr. Wu ran to the YMCA guest nameplate and looked at it for a long time, then went towards the east side of the hostel with a soft sound. However, the number that Mr. Wu was looking for could not be found. Then he knocked on the door of a room in the west side of the hostel. The door opened and Mr. Wu went in, closing the reporter out. At this time, there were two bodyguards who looked like wealthy people, who followed Mr. Wu as closely as the reporter did. The reporter suspected that Mr. Wu was suddenly taken care of greatly in Chongqing.

After the indifferent Sichuan tea boy put the reporter's business card in, Mr. Wu ran out of the door and invited the reporter inside. The owners of the room were Mr. Li and Mr. Gao. Seeing the reporter entering, they were all smiles. The reporter asked Mr. Wu about his health, and we started chatting.

Mr. Wu's kind triangular eyes made him lovable. His impression of Chongqing was that oranges were very cheap. When talking about international issues, he said that British Prime Minister Chamberlain was smart and fierce, like someone who is good at playing Tai Chi. He cooperated with Eden as a partner. On the surface, he said that Britain did not dare to clash with Japan, but in reality, Eden and his like were actively engaged in large-scale activities. Chamberlain wanted to unite with other countries, but it was all a delaying tactic.

The reporter asked him about his thoughts after Mr. Wang Jingwei left. Mr. Wu said: "Mr. Wang's betrayal of the party can be forgiven, but his betrayal of the country cannot be forgiven. Mr. Wang has high blood pressure and often has mental illnesses, but this mental illness is really unforgivable. When the decision to resist Japan was made years ago, Mr. Wang was also one of the decision-makers. Today, his betrayal is incomprehensible." The reporter asked him whether the rumor that Mr. Wang was going to Shanghai to hold a Fifth National Congress was true or not. Mr. Wu said: "Mr. Wang can do such things, what else can't he do? Not only Shanghai, he may also go to Nanjing. However, once Mr. Wang leaves the central government, he is no longer important. The likes of Tang Yuhe and Wang Kemin, who are quite mediocre, can also play the main role, but the puppet organization is all uncertain, so what can Mr. Wang do!"

The reporter then asked Mr. Wu if he could reveal one or two of the important proposals to be discussed at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee to be held on the 20th of this month. Mr. Wu said that the Ninth Plenary Session of the Central Committee would probably be held around the 15th of this month (the following paragraph is omitted).

When talking about Mr. Wu's personal life, he said that he likes to run around every day, go to teahouses, and rarely takes sedan chairs. "When I (Mr. Wu referring to himself) go to a teahouse, newspaper reporters say that I am investigating public opinion, which is making a fuss over a trifle. In fact, sometimes I buy some things and sort them out in the teahouse. There is no talk of investigating public opinion."

Because I was afraid of delaying Mr. Wu's valuable time, I said goodbye and left. Walking out of the YMCA, I felt that Mr. Wu had not aged at all in the year or so of the war of resistance, but he was more careful when speaking. (He Dong)

[Jueyu Society, Yunxian Express News] After Chairman Li Hanhun of the Provincial Government also took on the position of Commander-in-Chief of Guerrillas for the whole province, he decided to reorganize the 22 guerrilla zones in the whole province into nine major zones, with the administrative commissioners concurrently serving as guerrilla commanders. He has already issued orders to implement this plan, and has also telegraphed the guerrilla commanders, stating that before the administrative inspectors of each zone take office, they should still be responsible for hosting all military affairs. At the same time, Chairman Li carefully considered the candidates for the administrative commissioners of each zone, and decided to fill the positions with personnel who have military and political knowledge, experience, and reputation, and to adapt to wartime needs. He has newly selected nine commissioners for each zone and requested the Central Government to appoint them. He has also requested Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui of the Fourth War Zone to appoint 18 deputy commanders for the newly divided guerrilla zones.

### Foreign Reporters Witness and Say: Modern China Is Making Leaps and Bounds in Political Progress; The Anti-Japanese Front Is Strong

[Our Newspaper, Shanghai, 15th Special Dispatch] American reporter Hanson, who has traveled throughout China for three years, returned to the United States the previous week. When passing through Tokyo, he gave a speech to an American business newspaper, saying that China's greatest strength lies in the unity of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and General Bai Chongxi with General Zhou Enlai, leading the country and vowing never to compromise with the Japanese enemy. The newspaper also praised our country's recent strengthening of the united anti-Japanese front and political progress. China's policies during the War of Resistance, which surprised foreign observers, were the establishment of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Transportation. Their organizers were all former professors or technical experts from specialized schools, and many of them were once at odds with the country's leaders before the war. The famous geologist Weng Wenhao is an outstanding example. He is definitely not someone who parrots others' opinions. His assumption of office during the war may be the beginning of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in modern history.

### East River Detachment Active; Air Force Bombs Guangdong Enemy for Days; Two Enemy Ships Hit and Sunk

[External News from This Port] According to news from Shamian, yesterday morning, the Chinese Air Force suddenly bombed Japanese ships docked in the Pearl River, sinking two Japanese ships. Although this news is from Guangzhou, which is in the hands of the Japanese, it cannot be verified. However, the Chinese Air Force's activities in South China have clearly been strengthened.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 15th] A large-scale battle is likely to occur in South China. The enemy army is most likely to attack Wuzhou along the West River. The enemy has concentrated troops, artillery, and aircraft in the area, and a major battle is expected soon. Chinese aircraft flew to Guangdong last Friday and today to drop bombs, causing heavy damage to enemy artillery positions.

[Central News Agency, News from This Port] According to a visitor from Boluo, the people of the Huizhou-Boluo area in East River were completely recovered by us at the beginning of last month. During the period when Huizhou-Boluo was occupied, the armed people in various places, together with the regular army, constantly attacked the enemy, making the enemy exhausted and unable to gain a foothold, and had to abandon Huizhou-Boluo and retreat to the Shilong area. Recently, the Guangdong military authorities, considering that the mountains in the Huizhou-Boluo area are important and the people are brave and strong, making it the best guerrilla base in the East Road, specially expanded the various units of the Detachment and the self-defense corps that bravely resisted the war into the East River Detachment, ordering them to take on assault tasks at any time. Their strength is very strong, and they have now advanced to the vicinity of Shilong, coordinating with other friendly teams to attack the enemy from time to time, repeatedly inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. However, it is said that the team lacks cotton clothing, raincoats, medicines, and military blankets, and it is hoped that all parties can provide assistance to encourage them.

### Major Battle on the West River Is Imminent

[Jueyu Society, West River Express News] The military situation on the West River was tense before because the enemy army actively reinforced various places southwest of Sanshui and Makou, attempting to encircle and invade westward towards our Gaoyao and Sihui areas. However, because our defenses were strong, the enemy did not dare to advance rashly. Now our side has taken the initiative on the West River, and the enemies southwest of Sanshui and Makou are being closely monitored. Since the enemy army's fierce attack on Jinlintou failed on the 8th, they have been lying low in a corner, not daring to move. In the past week, in addition to the enemy army harassing and looting in various villages and our guerrilla teams attacking the enemy, there have only been minor contacts. Currently, the war on the West River is developing from the inside out. Our army has actively deployed, waiting for the opportunity to counterattack the enemy. The outbreak of a major battle is only a matter of time.

### Our Reinforcements Are Steadily Increasing Defenses

Gaoming, Sihui, Gaoyao, Yunfu, Xinxing, and Deqing counties on the West River have long been heavily guarded, with solid defenses. Recently, Li Hanhun's troops have been steadily returning to reinforce the east and west of the West River to participate in the battle. According to military news, two units of Li Hanhun's troops arrived in San Shui Lubao via the North River yesterday, and were stationed in the areas of Sihui Datang and Jiang'an, to monitor the enemy southwest of Jiangtang, Sanjiang, and Guanxian. Once they establish contact with friendly forces and local teams, they will immediately launch an annihilating battle against the remaining enemy in the Sanjiang and Guanmi areas. It is reported that the two units were originally tasked with advancing eastward along the Guangzhou-Sanshui Road to take Guangzhou. In addition, two divisions of the Guilin Army have recently moved east and arrived in the Gaoyao, Gaoming, and He Mountains to be responsible for guarding and preventing the enemy from crossing the West River to invade.

### Meeting of Generals on the Western Front

The units responsible for defending and attacking on the West River include two divisions of Li Hanhun's returning troops, a certain unit of the army, and the troops under Zhang Da of the 12th Army, as well as the local teams from various counties on the West River. Their strength is very strong. Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui of the Fourth War Zone recently appointed Xia Cheng, the commander of a certain army, as the commander-in-chief of the Western Route. Xia has already arrived and, after visiting the two commanders Zhang (Fakui) and Yu (Hanmou), immediately returned to a certain place in western Guangdong to preside over everything. According to military news, Xia has now handed over the responsibility for commanding the local teams in the various counties of the West River to Xu Jingtang. In order to discuss the new defense arrangements and counterattack plans for the West River with Xu, Xia has specially scheduled a meeting with Xu Jingtang and the commanders of the various units on a certain day to discuss all offensive and defensive strategies, so that the counterattack operations on the Western Route will advance simultaneously with the northeastern routes.

### Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Air Battle Over Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Seven enemy aircraft attacked Chongqing at around noon yesterday. They were met with a head-on blow from our aircraft and anti-aircraft artillery. The enemy aircraft hurriedly dropped dozens of bombs and fled. An investigation later revealed that dozens of civilian houses were destroyed and more than 300 civilians were killed or injured, a tragic sight. During the air battle, one enemy aircraft was shot down by us and was found in Jiangbei Dajiaochang.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 15th] Six Japanese aircraft bombed Wanxian yesterday morning. Details of the bombing are currently unknown.

### My Gift from Guangxi

— Tao Hanzhi

During my recent trip to Guangxi, I tasted the most exquisite wines, surpassing those from any other country. However, the gift I bring back is not wine but something even better: the new spirit of Guangxi and the power it can unleash.

Before going to Guangxi, I met with two leaders there and learned two things.

At the headquarters of the Fifth War Zone, after about ten aircraft flew past, I asked Commander-in-Chief Li Zongren: How many soldiers has Guangxi mobilized? He replied: Four hundred thousand. I quickly calculated that Guangxi, with a population of only thirteen million, had already sent out four hundred thousand soldiers. If every province were like Guangxi, based on the national population of four hundred and fifty million, we should have one million four hundred thousand soldiers to defend our country. Not only would Wuhan not need to be abandoned, but Nanjing might not have fallen. Commander-in-Chief Li said, I think so too.

Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, though ill in the East Lake Sanatorium, received me twice, both times discussing comprehensive tactics. This was a special term he coined for the second phase of the war of resistance. He said: Comprehensive tactics are a synthesis of attrition warfare, mobile warfare, and positional warfare. He put forward two key points: (1) Accumulate small victories into a major victory; (2) Exchange space for time. After receiving his instruction, I also proposed comprehensive education for discussion, and he also believed that only comprehensive education could meet the needs of comprehensive resistance and strive for overall victory.

I arrived in Guilin on November 21st and left Longzhou on December 23rd. Within Guangxi, what I want to report is my impression during these thirty-two days. During this period, there was the Weishan Conference, a major turning point in China. I personally witnessed Guangxi before and after the Weishan Conference. I personally saw Guangxi become active during this major turning point.

After the Weishan Conference, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and important generals successively arrived in Guilin. General Bai Chongxi arrived first. Guilin was already very cold in late December, but General Bai brought the warmth of the winter sun. He first informed us of the several guidelines put forward by Generalissimo Chiang at Weishan, such as prioritizing politics over military affairs, the people over soldiers, the rear over the front, and guerrilla warfare over positional warfare. How fortunate we were for the Republic of China at that time! Mr. Zhou Enlai, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, arrived. He informed me of the policy of integrating military, political, and cultural affairs in the guerrilla areas as decided in Hengshan, and said: If this policy is implemented, it can avoid all friction and sufficiently turn defense into an offensive opportunity, giving the Japanese army a fatal blow. Later, General Chen Cheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Third War Zone and concurrently Director of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, also came. He told me face-to-face, Now we have a standard. The success of the Political Department depends on the quality of the army, and the quality of the army depends on the opinion of the people. If the people say a certain army is good, it is really good; if the people say a certain army is bad, it is really bad. Secondly, he told me the new slogan of the Political Department: Propaganda is education; service is propaganda. Only serving the people is true propaganda. In this way, those stereotyped propaganda clichés are useless.

Guangxi is moving forward in great strides in the harmony of these new ideas. Guangxi wants to implement these ideas swiftly to protect the Great Southwest and to defend China. In this major turning point, what we first see is that Guangxi's politics are moving towards democratization. The most grassroots organization in Guangxi, the village and street people's assembly, already exists. Now, they are busy establishing township people's representative assemblies and county provisional councils. After the county provisional councils are established, provincial councils will be established in an orderly manner. This major event is being carried out bravely under the leadership of Chairman Huang Xuchu. Lei Gu, the Director of Civil Affairs, said to me: A nation without its people is not a nation, and people without organization are as good as no people. If we want to save the country, we must quickly organize the people. Not only Guangxi needs the organization of the people, but all the people of the country must quickly organize. We can say that the political structure of Guangxi is advancing towards democratization.

Guangxi's political operation is very efficient. After the big bombing on November 22nd, the methods for rescuing the victims and refugees were posted all over the city within two hours. Where to stay and where to receive relief funds were all announced. Those with relatives could temporarily stay with them. If relatives refused, the victims could sue their relatives. Mutual assistance in emergencies is not an abstract virtue but a legal obligation. When encountering the elderly and young blocking the way during air raids, young people have the obligation to give way and help carry them. This should also become an unwritten law.

Dispersing the population has recently become an important policy. The government suspected the instructions, so they followed along to inspect several places and found them to be as stated in the notices. Only then did they move from suspicion to admiration.

Speaking of military affairs, when Guangzhou fell, Guangxi was somewhat empty. After General Bai arrived, he transferred fresh troops on one hand, trained new recruits on the other, and universally organized strike teams. By the time I left, Guangxi was very stable. I passed through Lipu, Liujiang, Liuzhou, Luxu, Nanning, Longzhou, and Zhennanguan from Guilin, and every day at dawn, I saw or heard the sound of men drilling. Recently, they have been practicing how to fight guerrilla warfare. It is said that as of the time I left Longzhou, there were more than 500,000 soldiers who could fight, and the number continued to increase. These soldiers who are training are waiting for the Japanese army to come, and some are impatient and want to rush to Guangdong to help. If the Japanese warlords are not afraid of breaking their noses, they can come to Guangxi and try. (To be continued)

### League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting to Discuss Sanctions Against Japan; Britain Issues Strong Note to Japan; Far Eastern Policy Parallels the US

[Reuters, Geneva, 15th] The League of Nations Administrative Council will hold a meeting tomorrow. The main items on its agenda are the withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain and the Chinese request to sanction Japan. The latter was placed on the agenda for discussion at China's urgent request.

[Reuters, London, 15th] The diplomatic correspondent of "The Sunday Times" said, "The new note sent by Britain to Japan is approximately two thousand words long, and its language is strong (stronger than any previous British note since the start of the Sino-Japanese War). It clarifies Britain's policy and reiterates in the most formal manner its adherence to the principles of 'Open Door' and 'Equal Opportunity.' It cannot agree to unilateral actions to revise the Nine-Power Treaty, but it will consider constructive negotiations to amend the treaty. The result of this note is to bring British policy into line with the note presented by the United States to Japan on October 27th of last year. The British and American notes are not completely identical, but the principles of both sides are essentially the same. Although the British note does not contain threats of retaliatory action, such action is not absolutely impossible, but drastic measures will not be taken at present."

Hu Shih-tse's Remarks

[Associated Press, Geneva, 15th] Hu Shih-tse, the Chinese ambassador to Switzerland, gave a lengthy interview to a reporter from this agency, stating briefly that President Roosevelt's message to Congress is extremely relevant to the requests China has made to the League of Nations. The Chinese issue has already been included in the League Council's agenda. Ambassador Gu Weijun will speak to the Council about the situation in the Far East and will request the Council to resolve the Chinese issue based on previous resolutions. Hu also stated that since the last Council adjournment, the US government has repeatedly expressed a strong stance on the increasingly dangerous situation in the Far East. As for what kind of impact the attitude expressed by the US President will have on the resolution of this League Council meeting, it is difficult to predict. China's resistance has lasted for eighteen months, and governments and peoples of various countries have clearly recognized China's determination to resist for the long term. Japan has repeatedly stated that it respects the interests of various countries in China, but the various illegal actions of the Japanese army in the occupied areas of China prove that Japan has completely destroyed the interests of various countries in China. Hu concluded by saying that the Chinese people hope that governments of various countries will protect their own interests in China and should not rely solely on China itself to fight for the protection of the interests of various countries.

### British Newspapers Emphasize German-Polish Talks; Hitler Decides to Demand Colonies

[Reuters, London, 15th] The Sunday editions of newspapers here attach great importance to the Hitler-Beck meeting. The diplomatic correspondent of "The Sunday Times" said that the meeting was extremely important because Hitler's conversation revealed the outline of Hitler's 1939 plan. Hitler told Polish Foreign Minister Beck that he would not intensify pressure on Danzig and Memel in the near future, nor would he force Poland to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. The Ukrainian question would also not be handled through aggression. Hitler also stated that Poland should pay close attention to the split of the Soviet Union in the next two to three years, but would not participate until the time was ripe. The main point of the Hitler-Beck meeting was the colonial issue. Hitler supported Poland in immediately applying for colonies and at the same time allowed Colonel Beck to observe the impact of Hitler convening a colonial conference before the end of the year. A Warsaw correspondent for the "Observer" said that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop originally intended to visit Poland in March, but it has been changed to late January due to the new situation determined by Hungary joining the Anti-Comintern Pact and Germany also planning to join. A Warsaw correspondent for "The Sunday Times" said that diplomatic circles believe that the Franco-Polish alliance is undergoing extremely drastic changes, and only a miracle can save it.

### Main Achievements of the Rome Talks: Both Sides Willing to Maintain Peace; Britain Hopes for Improved Franco-Italian Relations; Germany Denies Mediating Disputes

[Reuters, Rome, 14th] Although senior British officials have stated that there are still differences of opinion between the two countries, they have also proven the traditional friendship between the two countries. Although the current international situation does not allow any new agreements to be signed, relations between the two countries have been placed on a solid foundation of mutual respect. Italy feels that Britain has expressed appropriate importance to the achievements under the fascist system. One of the main gains of this meeting was the mutual respect among the participants in the talks and the emergence of goodwill between Chamberlain and Mussolini. Such private, harmonious relations can be expected to benefit the progress of discussions when the European situation requires them to discuss matters together. Chamberlain and Mussolini are unwilling to risk their countries in wars without any benefit, and both are determined to safeguard the interests of their nations and nationalities. There is no conflict between Britain and Italy. If the spirit of this meeting is applied to other disputes, various disputes will not threaten European peace. Britain is eager to improve relations between France and Italy, but does not want to abandon its allies in any way. This does not mean that Britain opposes the German-Italian axis, but hopes that the strength of the German-Italian axis will turn towards peaceful proposals, in which Western European democracies can also participate. Before leaving Italy, Chamberlain issued a joint statement saying that politicians from both countries had exchanged opinions frankly and in a very harmonious atmosphere and had decided to develop relations between the two countries in the spirit of friendship stipulated in Article 16 of the Anglo-Italian Agreement. The desire of both countries is to implement this policy to maintain peace.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 14th] Responsible individuals here recently declared that members of the British delegation have stated that cabinet members of their country are satisfied with this trip. Prime Minister Mussolini's attitude was sincere and just, which is most noteworthy. No explicit demands were made regarding the Suez Canal's management rights and the French port of Djibouti in East Africa. His words and actions avoided anything that could cause difficulties. In addition, Prime Minister Mussolini voluntarily stated that he would earnestly fulfill the various provisions of the Anglo-Italian Agreement, the plan for the withdrawal of foreign volunteers passed by the Non-Intervention Committee, and that he would promote a policy of peace in order to leisurely develop the natural resources of his country and its colonies. The British cabinet members also expressed their gratitude to Mussolini for his contribution to the Munich Conference in September of last year. This conversation involved political and economic issues, but no agreement was reached. This was originally expected by the British side. The British cabinet members' trip was intended to discuss the general situation and did not anticipate any concrete results. Now that Britain and Italy have clarified their positions and the foundation for peace has been solidified, it is a good thing. In addition, both sides exchanged views on the issue of arms reduction, but did not seek any constructive solutions. Regarding the issue of accommodating Jewish refugees, Mussolini stated that he was willing to cooperate with Britain. The British cabinet members also discussed it when they visited the Pope.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 15th] Regarding this Anglo-Italian talk, while circles in London and Paris believe there were no achievements, political circles here do not think so. According to a spokesperson, it is a gratifying thing that politicians are now holding direct talks to understand each other's positions, and this habit has shown progress. This approach is more effective.

French Fleet Practices; Italy Considers Negotiations

[Associated Press, Paris, 15th] French authorities announced that three submarines have been ordered to sail to Syria immediately, and the Mediterranean Fleet has also sailed to the North African coast to participate in "winter exercises." The Atlantic Fleet has also been ordered to move out at the same time.

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Part of the French Mediterranean Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet will conduct joint exercises in the Casablanca area this month.

[Reuters, Paris, 15th] General Gamelin and Vice Admiral Darlan are scheduled to go to North Africa on the 19th to inspect Oran and Mers El Kébir in Algeria, and the coast of Morocco. Darlan will also inspect Dakar.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 15th] Newspapers commenting on the results of the Anglo-Italian talks stated that the attitudes of both Britain and Italy were to maintain the balance of power in the Mediterranean and the peace of Europe. Britain acknowledged Italy's progress and recognized the equal status of the Italian Empire. Both sides agreed that no other countries should acquire special status on either side of the Red Sea. "Il Messaggero" carried an exclusive report stating that Italy hopes to resolve Franco-Italian disputes through negotiations and does not want to resort to force.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 14th] "Il Telegrafo", known for reflecting Foreign Minister Ciano's views, published an important article today denying that Italy had invited Britain to mediate Franco-Italian disputes, and stated that Italy might consider direct negotiations with France. It stated that in January 1935, Italy signed an agreement with France because it was preparing to use force against Abyssinia. Afterwards, France did not keep its promises and instead participated in sanctions against Italy, which was wrong. To this day, Italy feels unwilling to reopen negotiations with France based on that agreement. This does not mean that Italy is absolutely in favor of war. Once France's attitude is calmer and no longer aggressive, Italy will seek other ways to resolve this issue. In short, once matters between France and Italy change, the Italian government does not object to reopening negotiations with France.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 14th] There are rumors that Hitler had asked Mussolini to try to maintain European peace for another year. The German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, issued a statement saying that the above statement was completely inaccurate. During British Prime Minister Chamberlain's visit to Italy, I did not have any indirect contact with the Italian government.

The Spanish Issue Is the Key to the Situation

[Associated Press, Rome, 15th] Authoritative sources declared that the Anglo-Italian meeting had no results and no new agreements. Chamberlain insisted on a policy of non-intervention in the Spanish war. Mussolini agreed to the second point, but did not accept the first point and had no "new demands." As for Mediterranean rights, he was still unwilling to easily relinquish them. Both sides had extensive talks, including important political and economic issues. The withdrawal of Italian volunteers from Spain was not discussed or decided in detail.

[Reuters, Rome, 14th] Gayda wrote in "Il Giornale d'Italia" today, "If foreign troops of the Spanish government army withdraw, Italy is also willing to withdraw its volunteers from Spain, but this issue must be resolved by the Non-Intervention Committee."

[Reuters, Berlin, 14th] Here, a Rome correspondent for the "Frankfurter Zeitung" said, "The purpose of the British Prime Minister's visit to Rome was to promote the limitation of armaments, the humanization of warfare, and the maintenance of friendly relations between the four major European powers, but it failed to achieve its goals due to the disputes between France and Italy. The crux of the situation lies in the Spanish issue. If France is willing to stop its assistance to the Spanish government, the other issues between France and Italy will not be resolved. Prime Minister Mussolini must have asked Chamberlain to persuade France to change its attitude towards Spain."

[Reuters, Barcelona, 15th] The local official newspaper "La Vanguardia" expressed disappointment with the results of the Anglo-Italian talks in Rome. The newspaper said, "Mussolini has not yet abandoned his plan to subdue Spain. If Italy's imperial dream is successful, Spain will be reduced to a political and economic colony." The newspaper criticized the Spanish government army's general mobilization, saying, "The multitude of people can compensate for the enemy's material superiority. It is people, not materials, who determine the victory of war. The freedom that Spaniards love is in a dangerous situation. If necessary, we will call upon people from twelve to eighty years old to serve the country."

### Heavy Snow in New York; Extreme Cold in Eastern States; Airliner Explodes in Mid-Air

[Reuters, New York, 14th] There were nine inches of heavy snow, and the streets in the city were blocked by snow, greatly hindering transportation. Radio stations urged motorists not to drive into the city center to avoid danger. The authorities have ordered 32,000 workers to clear snow from various places. The eastern states were extremely cold, and more than a dozen people died. In Montana, an airliner exploded in mid-air due to cold wind and rain, killing four people.

### Soviet Union to Conduct Population Census Starting Tomorrow

[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] The Soviet Union will begin conducting a population survey on the 17th of this month to compile statistics. This survey covers 200 million people. There are 500,000 surveyors, most of whom are under the age of fourteen and have undergone rigorous training for several months. They hold five questions that indicate changes since the Soviet revolution, collecting the public's answers to these questions. This survey also records the social progress since the First Five-Year Plan and accurately estimates the ethnic minorities within the Soviet Union.

### American Fleet Sails Through the Panama Canal; Commercial Vessels Resume Navigation

[Reuters, Panama, 14th] The US fleet's exercise of sailing through the Panama Canal from west to east began yesterday and is expected to be completed tonight. The final stage of the exercise was to depart from Balboa this morning and sail to Cristobal on the Atlantic side, a distance of 40 miles. It is expected that commercial vessel navigation can resume today.

### German Refugees Crossing into France Reach 100,000

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet declared at the first meeting of the French Refugee Relief Committee, "In the past few months, 100,000 German refugees have crossed into France. They are all regarded as 'non-Aryans.' France now accommodates 3.2 million foreigners, including 200,000 refugees. No other country has had such achievements in accommodating refugees."

### Spain's General Mobilization: Republic Authorizes Government to Conscript Male and Female Citizens

[Reuters, Barcelona, 15th] The Spanish Republic promulgated a decree today authorizing the government to conscript male and female citizens nationwide between the ages of seventeen and fifty-five to serve the country when necessary. It is expected that after the government implements the general mobilization order, 300,000 to 500,000 people can be sent to the front lines, about half of which can be supplied by Catalonia because it is more densely populated.

### Suez Canal Company Holds Board Meeting; Bonnet Attends and Reports; Firmly Upholding Interests

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] Suez Canal Company General Manager Bonnet reported at a board meeting of the company that Italy's demands for the Canal have aroused close attention in France. Bonnet said, "Recently, some people have advocated requiring the reorganization of the Suez Canal Company, which is tantamount to trying to eliminate our special interests in the Canal. However, this demand has been eased, and now there are only issues of expanding the board of directors and slightly increasing passage fees. The Egyptian government has long stated that the status of the Canal cannot be changed without Egypt's consent. The status of the Canal cannot be changed without the permission of the company. Our company will never allow anyone to infringe upon its rights. The Suez Canal will never change its status under threat."

### US Assistant Secretary of War Broadcasts in Support of National Defense Plan; Aviation Association President Horner Advocates Greatly Increasing Teachers and Aircraft

[Reuters, Washington, 15th] US Assistant Secretary of War Johnson gave a national radio address last night in support of the Weathersford national defense plan. It is said that the world is very likely to be engulfed in flames. Munich only exposed and highlighted the nature of this world crisis, but its crisis was long understood by various countries. Aggressors carefully select aggressive actions and locations, and avoid disputes with countries of equal or greater strength. From this point of view, the United States urgently needs to strengthen its national defense to safeguard its rights. Regarding Germany's plans during the European War (many of which have not been published), Johnson said that Germany at that time completely ignored the United States' participation in the war because they believed that the United States was weak and incompetent and not worth considering seriously. Therefore, Hindenburg and Ludendorff believed that the United States' participation in the war was not important. Now that the United States has strengthened its national defense, all countries know it, so it is our important task today to make ourselves feared by all people and to prevent them from harming the rights of the United States.

### France Increases Aircraft Production to 200 Per Month

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] The French Minister of Aviation stated in the Lower House that the plan set by the Supreme Aviation Authority will soon be fully realized. France can now produce 80 aircraft per month, but starting this spring, the output can be increased to 200 aircraft per month.

### League of Nations Political Council to Meet Today

The League of Nations Administrative Council will convene in Geneva on the 16th. A significant item on the agenda for this meeting is the proposal to aid China through sanctions.

At the previous League of Nations conference, due to China's earnest appeal, a unanimous resolution was reached to invoke Article 16 of the Covenant and implement assistance to China in resisting Japanese aggression. Although this resolution did not immediately have a major effect, it is undeniable that China's international situation has subsequently improved significantly, while Japan has become increasingly mired in difficulties.

China's success in the previous conference was due to the valiant efforts of our representatives and the fervent support of righteous individuals within the League of Nations, such as the Soviet representative. However, the main reasons were: firstly, Japan's expansion in the Far East directly threatened the interests of European countries, especially Britain; and secondly, the united and unyielding spirit of China's resistance strengthened the confidence of the major powers in aiding China.

However, the past aid provided by various countries to China and sanctions against Japan have not been active enough. The assistance given to China has been like a drop in the bucket, and there have been no concrete measures taken to sanction Japan.

Therefore, in this League of Nations General Assembly, we should not only strive for more practical and extensive assistance from various countries, especially in finance, medicine, military supplies, military raw materials, technical personnel, etc., but also strive to implement effective sanctions against Japan, especially boycotts, debt collection, and the cessation of military supplies and military raw materials to Japan. Only in this way can Japan be threatened, its aggression halted, and even if it recklessly takes risks, it will inevitably collapse more quickly. This is the common demand of righteous humanity and the sacred duty of the League of Nations to maintain world peace.

Given Japan's increasingly barbaric foreign policy, its growing antagonism with European and American powers, China's increasingly strong and united resistance, which has further increased the confidence of European and American powers in us, the recent expressions of active opposition to aggression by the United States, the trend of closer ties between Britain and the United States, and the failure of the Rome talks leading to greater cooperation between Britain and France, we firmly believe that our aforementioned urgent demands are realizable.

We now hope, on the one hand, that our representatives will fight even more valiantly for human justice and the glory of our motherland. On the other hand, we should also mobilize domestic and international public opinion and engage in national diplomacy, using various effective methods to urge the League of Nations to pass our strict and urgent demands.

### Internal Strife Intensifies Within the Nazi Party

According to a London dispatch on the 15th, Hitler will conduct another purge, dismiss several high-ranking Nazi leaders using pseudonyms, and execute many other officials. Propaganda Minister Goebbels will be dismissed this spring. Göring is attacking Ribbentrop for the negative international impact of the anti-Semitic policy and the responsibility for the deterioration of German-American relations. According to a Paris dispatch on the same day, the number of Germans who have fled to France due to party struggles has reached 100,000, and the number who have fled to other countries is even greater.

The exposure of the internal crisis within the fascist aggression front is not unexpected at a time when the international situation is gradually improving and the peace and democracy front is becoming more consolidated and developed. However, we must pay attention to how fascist dictators such as Hitler will resolve this kind of internal conflict and the widespread and intense internal mass opposition movement. There is no other way but to intensify their external wars. This is true of Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese militarists. Therefore, we need to strengthen the anti-fascist people's front within the aggressor countries, and need to more actively and extensively organize the anti-fascist and anti-aggression movement of righteous and peaceful people around the world.

### Japan Again Issues Threats, Preparing to Sever Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union; Militarists' Arrogance Increases, Actually Believing the Soviet Union Dares Not Fight

[Associated Press Tokyo, 15th] According to diplomatic circles, Soviet-Japanese relations have become increasingly dangerous since the Changkufeng Incident. The recent breakdown of fishery negotiations is the fuse for the current tense situation. Japanese authorities recently declared to reporters that Japan is prepared to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union unless the Soviet Union allows the Japanese demands to improve the fishery agreement. If the fishery agreement issue remains unresolved at the beginning of the fishing season, the severance of diplomatic relations will be realized in early April. Furthermore, the Japanese side has decided not to back down on fishing rights in Siberia and stated that if the fishery agreement cannot be improved, it will use force to protect fishermen going north to fish. The Japanese military authorities believe that the Soviet Union will definitely not (?) use force because of this. According to military sources, the Soviet Union is in conflict with Germany in Ukraine, so the Soviet side would definitely not dare to engage in a "larger dispute" with Japan. Japanese political circles believe that the prior withdrawal of Japanese envoys to the Soviet Union might shift the Soviet attitude.

### On Soviet-Japanese Relations

— Fei Ru

Yesterday, the Japanese authorities actually declared to Associated Press reporters: "Japan is prepared to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union unless the Soviet Union allows the Japanese demands to improve the fishery agreement." The Soviet-Japanese fishery agreement issue has cast a shadow on recent Soviet-Japanese relations. We have repeatedly reviewed (see "The Development of the Soviet-Japanese Fishery Dispute" in this newspaper on December 23). That it would inevitably become the fuse for the most serious problem in Soviet-Japanese relations was within our judgment. Now, the Japanese aggressors intend to use this issue to act recklessly, which is worth our special attention.

The dispute over the fishery agreement has evolved to the current stage, ending the oral and written consultations and entering the time to express attitude and determination with practical actions. The terms of both the main and supplementary Soviet-Japanese fishery agreements expired last year. As a result of several breakdowns in negotiations between the two sides, the Soviet-Japanese fishery issue has become a state of no agreement. During the off-fishing season, not having an agreement doesn't matter, but when the fishing season arrives, this problem will become extremely serious. Examining the points of contention held by both the Soviet and Japanese sides and the course of their negotiations, it is very difficult for the Soviet-Japanese fishery issue to achieve a satisfactory outcome. What will happen when this issue evolves at the start of the spring fishing season is something that no one can predict, but based on the general international situation, our understanding of the Japanese side's remarks to reporters yesterday is about the following:

(1) This kind of statement by the Japanese military and political authorities has a very strong odor of intimidation. Japanese aggressors have always been accustomed to using this trick to deal with international issues, hoping to obtain great profits without investing capital. Most of the major historical gains from China have come from the effectiveness of this kind of intimidation. Therefore, the Japanese military authorities, under the absurd thought that "they believe the Soviet Union definitely does not dare to use force because of this," have released rampant opinions. However, intimidation can only be effective when the target is a coward. If the other party is a tough one, then the Japanese paper tiger will immediately shrink back. Our heroic resistance since August 13th has put the aggressors in a dilemma. Last year's Changkufeng Incident also gave them a deeper lesson. Today, when the Soviet Union is preparing to give the aggressors "two or three times the blow in return," the intimidation of the Japanese militarists will completely lose its effectiveness.

(2) The Japanese aggressors are preparing to advance their gestures to attack the Soviet Union further. Japan's encirclement of the Soviet Union completely adopts the German-Japanese pincer attack strategy. They dare to challenge the Soviet Union because Germany and Italy are echoing them in the West. The Japanese military believes: "The Soviet Union is in conflict with Germany in Ukraine, so the Soviet side would definitely not dare to engage in a larger dispute with Japan," which is not without reason. However, this wishful thinking of the Japanese aggressors is also wrong. Our arguments are: (1) The Soviet Union's military equipment is complete enough to cope with attacks from both East and West aggressors; (2) Germany also has countless strong enemies in the West, such as Britain and France, which definitely cannot allow Germany to become stronger for long; (3) The political and economic difficulties within Germany severely restrict Hitler from going outside the "circle of intimidation." Ukraine is definitely not Czechoslovakia and cannot be obtained by intimidation. In this way, Japan's European horns will completely lose their effectiveness.

(3) This intimidation from the Japanese military and political authorities will probably not dare to rashly take practical action at present. After all, the intention is still nothing more than three purposes: first, to divert domestic attention to foreign issues, to alleviate current internal disputes, and to create an excuse to force Parliament to pass huge budget proposals and the General Mobilization Law implementation bill; second, to deceive the democratic countries of Britain, the United States, and France, so that their sanctions against Japan will be delayed, in order to alienate the more solid cooperation between the Soviet Union and Britain, the United States, and France; and third, to confuse our correct understanding, in order to echo the traitor theories they have created and divide our resistance forces.

(4) The degree of Soviet-Japanese disputes will increase day by day. Even if "the severance of diplomatic relations at the beginning of the fishing season may not be realized in early April," it is possible that the dispute will evolve into a localized actual conflict. Japan claims: "If the fishery agreement cannot be improved, it will use force to protect fishermen going north to fish." But in the Soviet Union, not only will the fishery agreement not be revised as the Japanese side hopes, but also 40 military fishing zones will be recovered. In addition, Japan's current direction of capturing China is focused on the Northwest, and we are also actively preparing strong military forces to meet the Japanese. Then, the struggle in the Northwest will become more intense. The Northwest has close relations with the Soviet Union, and recently Sino-Soviet relations have been progressing day by day. Soviet assistance to China's resistance will be more active. Therefore, the Soviet-Japanese dispute will gradually be linked to the Sino-Japanese war. The day when Japan truly severs diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union will be realized at that time.

Let's see what other tricks the Japanese aggressors will come up with besides gesturing and intimidation?

### British Aid to China Society's Fundraising Committee to Issue Declaration; Calling on All Sectors to Donate to Relieve Refugees; War Zone Widening, Refugees Dying and Injured Everywhere, Wailing Everywhere; Allied Nations Still Concerned, How Can Compatriots Stand Idly By?

The British Relief for Chinese Refugees Society, Hong Kong and South China Branch, since its establishment, has been actively promoting relief work. Recently, a fundraising committee has been established, with prominent figures in Hong Kong, Zhou Zhaowu, Tan Huantang, Ye Lanquan, Chen Lanfang, Chen Lüqian, Lei Yin Sun, Li Jianfeng, Lin Peisheng, Huang Maolin, and the Chinese Women's Association, the Hong Kong Women's War Disaster Relief Association, and the Hong Kong Comfort Women's Association serving as standing committee members to promote fundraising work. As the war in our country has spread from north to south, with cries of grief everywhere, and rescue is urgently needed, it is planned to issue a declaration in the coming days, calling on all overseas compatriots to jointly provide relief. The declaration is recorded below:

Death and Injury on Roads, Flesh and Blood Flying

Unfortunately, our China is facing a war. The affected people are all over the provinces. British people, based on the great way of neighborly love, for the good deed of disaster relief, the Mayor of London, running around, especially strong advocacy, founded in the British capital China Relief Society, benevolence righteousness, spread around the world. Now also set up in Hong Kong, Hong Kong and South China Branch Governor as the president, each gentleman serving duties, unanimous progress. The Secretary for Chinese Affairs invites all merchants to a meeting at the Secretary's Office to organize a fundraising committee. Twenty-five Hong Kong gentry merchants were immediately elected as standing committee members, and three chairmen and vice chairmen were elected. The donation committee then invites the leaders of various groups and social celebrities to take office. This is the beginning of the establishment, work should be more active, in order to increase fundraising efficiency. Alas, Xuan Huang war blood, filled the country, houses destroyed, how to be home, roads displaced, how to eat, and dead and injured on the road, flesh and blood flying, father crying for his son, woman crying for her husband, wailing everywhere, unbearable to hear and see, all compatriots, Ning Rong stand by, now fortunately Cheng branch leadership advocacy, fundraising donation, rescue drowning fire, dare not strive.

Donate One More Penny, Save One More Life

Since the Lugou Bridge Incident, the War of Resistance has been more than a year. The number of donations raised in Hong Kong has reached several millions. Now that traffic is blocked and business is declining, even a good bow becomes a crossbow, but where duties lie, we must strive to do our best and be brave in doing what is right. We also hope that all sectors will continue to work hard. Moreover, the funds raised are exclusively for China relief, which is great for the refugees. The British are neighbors and are still concerned about this. We are of the same race, how can we stand idly by? If we do not hold, we cannot live up to the friendly aid of allied nations, and we are also ashamed of our own shame. Now, the compatriots in the mainland are dying and waiting for relief, and their lives are in the balance. What is expected is that the group will work together, without laziness or waste, and raise one more point of donation, that is, save one more side of life. A large tree has more shade, it is good to be a thousand chapters, and the division of Lianquan, even a spoonful, also knows sweetness. The people are the foundation of the country, refugees and wounded soldiers are equally important, and the resettlement of refugees is enough to lighten the government's worries. This is also what the Association should actively undertake. Zhan Yan Bang clan, meaning depressed sleeves, I would like to say, Xi Gongliang cha.

### More Than 5,000 Printing Workers in Hong Kong Implement Long-Term Debt Repayment Campaign; Second Session of Union Officials Took Office Yesterday

The Hong Kong Printing Industry Workers Union, at the Delegates Assembly the other day, resolved to respond to the one-yuan debt repayment campaign, and resolved measures to promote it for a long time.

It is found that the union has more than 5,000 members. If the promotion can be done properly, the results will be certain in the future. Also, the second session of the union officials held an inauguration ceremony yesterday. Among the guests present were educator Tao Xingzhi, the union's honorary consultant Du Qizhang, and many people from the press.

### Someone is Planning to Open an Aircraft Factory in Hong Kong; 5 Million Has Been Raised and Land Has Been Requested from the Hong Kong Port Office; Work is Limited to Assembly, Raw Materials are Purchased from the United Kingdom and the United States

Hong Kong is an important terminal station for aviation in the Far East. In recent years, civil aviation has developed, and all businesses related to aviation have made great progress. Only the assembly plant is still lacking. According to reliable sources yesterday, someone in Hong Kong recently raised funds to set up an aircraft factory. The amount of shares raised is said to be 5 million yuan. The progress is quite mature. The Hong Kong government has also been requested to allocate a piece of land in a certain area of the New Territories as a site for the factory. However, the authorities have not yet made a definite indication as to whether or not to approve this request, and the initiators are actively proceeding. At the same time, personnel have been sent to the United Kingdom and the United States to order aircraft engines and all other important parts, preparing to start the factory. Now the progress is so urgent that this factory has a great possibility of being realized. It is also heard that the scope of work of the factory in the future will only be for assembly purposes. The engines and parts will be purchased from abroad and transported to Hong Kong, and the fuselage will be built in Hong Kong. The most difficult thing is the lack of a qualified aircraft inspector.

### High-Altitude Guns Set Up All Over Hong Kong's Reservoirs; Strictly Preventing the Enemy from Destroying Drinking Water; If the Enemy Attacks, There is No Other Way Except Bombing; Throwing Bacteria and Poisonous Agents Can Be Eliminated

The drinking water of Hong Kong residents depends entirely on the water stored in the reservoirs, which is no different from the lifeline of all residents in Hong Kong. In the event of war, protecting the reservoirs is indeed worthy of attention. The reporter asked this question to anti-aircraft expert Mr. Stielow Birkenes yesterday. According to him, the use of poison gas and bacteria in warfare is despised by civilized countries. The authorities have set up strong anti-aircraft guns to defend all reservoirs in Hong Kong. Even if a war breaks out,

If enemy aircraft attack the reservoirs as targets, the anti-aircraft guns will be able to keep them out of the reservoir area. If so, the enemy aircraft's flight altitude will increase, and it will be difficult to accurately drop bombs. Even if they hit, it will be a matter of luck. There are three ways to destroy the reservoirs other than direct bombing: (1) poison agents, (2) poison gas, and (3) bacteria. The most common method is to inject mustard gas or arsenic smoke into the reservoirs. However, after passing through the filter layer of the original equipment of the reservoirs, the mustard gas poison can be eliminated. The only thing that cannot be filtered is quality gas, because this kind of gas quality is transformed after dissolving in water, but the amount is very small. Large reservoirs in Hong Kong, such as the Jubilee Reservoir and the Tai Tam Tuk Reservoir, xxxxxxxxxxxxx cannot poison this. It is impossible to poison this. As for arsenic smoke, although there is no perfect defense method, this kind of poison gas is ideally terrifying, but it is very difficult to use in practice. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx What is worth worrying about is the small reservoirs that do not have filter layer equipment. However, the area of small reservoirs is not wide, the targets are few, and it is also difficult to drop bombs. After the mustard gas sinks to the bottom of the reservoir, because the bottom of the reservoir is lower than the outlets, even if it is hit, only a small amount of it will flow into each water pipe, but it can be eliminated by decomposition method. After the smoke is mixed into the reservoir, it has been proved by experiments that it can be eliminated by chemical methods immediately. Therefore, the authorities have made proper plans for the protection of Hong Kong's Guishui reservoirs during the war, so there is no need to worry.

### Female Adoption Registration; Deadline Extended for Residents; Do Not Wait and See Any Longer

The Hong Kong Secretary for Chinese Affairs' Office is holding this time of adoption registration. Previously, residents were given an extension. If there are people raising adopted daughters, they must register at the office as soon as possible. If there are those who wait and see and do not register before the registration deadline, they will be severely punished. This matter has been seen in previous reports. Yesterday, according to an official of the office, there are still many residents in Hong Kong who have adopted daughters but have not registered with the Secretary for Chinese Affairs. In order to enable all slaveholders to register, the Secretary for Chinese Affairs has specially extended the registration period again, hoping that residents will not wait and see again, and register immediately, so as to avoid being punished after the deadline.

### Fire in Wan Chai Hennessy Road; A Warehouse Destroyed; Mei Wo and Lin Wo Hing's Inventory Consumed by Fire; What Was Burned Were Water Pine Wood and Other Materials, Losses Amounting to Tens of Thousands

At this time of high winds and dry weather, fires occur frequently in various districts, almost every day. At around 2:00 a.m. yesterday morning, a large fire broke out again in Wan Chai Hennessy Road. What was burned was a warehouse, and the goods stored in it were flammable water pine wood and charcoal, so once it caught fire, it spread to various places and could not be saved. As a result, the entire building was destroyed, with losses amounting to as much as twenty to thirty thousand yuan. The adjacent building was also damaged by water. The fire was completely extinguished at 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning. The details are recorded as follows:

Front and Rear Warehouses

The fire occurred at Warehouse No. 360 on Hennessy Road, near Tin Lok Lane, Wan Chai. The warehouse was an old-fashioned building with a wide area. The entire warehouse was divided into two parts. The front part was the warehouse of Mei Wo Company, storing water pine hat molds and water pine oranges. The rear part was the charcoal warehouse of Lin Wo Hing. Both were easily flammable. The Mei Wo warehouse was on Hennessy Road, with entrances and exits from the front door. Lin Wo Hing had entrances and exits from the back door. The manager of Mei Wo Company is named Zheng Liangjun. The warehouse is usually locked with an iron lock and unattended.

Fierce Fire

At 2:45 a.m. yesterday morning, it is not known why it was accidentally burned. When the fire was ignited, no one noticed it. It was not until it burned the internal goods and the flames flew out of the house that passers-by noticed it. They knocked on the door to inquire, but there was no response. The passers-by realized it was a fire and immediately blew their whistles to call the police, alarming nearby residents, who woke up in fright from their sleep. The police on duty nearby also arrived at the scene to investigate and immediately notified the Second Police Station to report to the Central Headquarters and the fire departments of various districts. The Wan Chai Fire Department was the first to send vehicles to the scene, and the Central Headquarters also dispatched two vehicles. At the same time, the police station also sent Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to maintain order. When the firefighters arrived, the fire had already burned through the entire warehouse. Because the goods in the warehouse were easy to burn, the fire was extremely fierce, and the night sky was illuminated red.

Losses Amounting to Tens of Thousands

Firefighters opened hoses and injected water at the front, rear, and sides of the warehouse. After about an hour, the fire was slightly suppressed. At 8:00 a.m. yesterday morning, the fire was completely extinguished. As a result, the entire building was burned. The Southern Automobile Company at No. 350 next door was also damaged by water. The total value of Mei Wo's inventory reached 20,000 yuan. Lin Wo Hing's inventory had more than 100 bags of charcoal, which had just been delivered the night before and was burned yesterday morning, with losses of more than 8,000 yuan. Mei Wo purchased insurance for 10,000 yuan, and Lin Wo Hing also purchased insurance for several thousand yuan.

### In the Waters of Yangjiang Prefecture; Seven Fishing Boats Went Out to Sea to Fish; Tragically Bombed by Japanese Aircraft; Two Fishing Trawlers Killed More Than Sixty People; The Remaining Five Ships Suffered Countless Deaths and Injuries

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, there are still those who encounter bombings by Japanese aircraft. According to the Fishermen's Association, Mr. Cheung Chau member reported that the Li Daohua and Li Daoming brothers, fishermen of the fisherman, were driving two fishing trawlers out to sea to fish separately. When the boat was in the sea area of Donghu, Yangjiang Prefecture, they were about to cast their nets to catch fish. Several Japanese aircraft bombed Dongbanda, and those who bombed the destination inaccurately had four heavy bombs hit Li Daohua's fishing trawler. The fishing trawler was hit by bombs, with a loud noise, and blood and ship wood were flying around, broken arms and broken legs were floating with the sea, which was unbearable to see. In addition to his family members, there were a total of about 30 partners on Li Daohua's fishing trawler. The fishing trawler sank immediately after being bombed. Those who did not die in the bombing also died in the water. At the same time, Li Daoming's fishing trawler stopped at a distance from Li Daohua's fishing trawler. When the bombs were bombed, the entire sea was stirred by the huge force of the bombs. Then, the angry sea and huge waves rushed to Li Daoming's fishing trawler. Li Daoming's fishing trawler suffered misfortune and the entire ship capsized, drowning more than 30 people on the spot. In addition to these two ships, five other fishing boats were also unfortunately hit by the Japanese aircraft and sank three times. Unfortunately, the ship numbers and the names of the fishermen on the five other fishing boats are unknown, but when they were reduced by the single, xxxxxxxxx, xxxxxxxxxxx, there were few who were able to escape to the water, and approximately 60 to 70 deaths were calculated for Li Daohua's and Li Daoming's ships, but the other five boats, the other five ships, are difficult to count.

### Mei Lihua Wins Queen of Song Title After Six Charity Performances at Tong Sai; Wan Hongnu Named Red Star of Song; Hua Yinghen Abruptly Withdraws

For the freedom and happiness of the nation, for the victory of the war of resistance, and to relieve compatriots in suffering, the singing girls of Tong Sai deeply understand the meaning of "even a humble woman has a responsibility." They have held five charity performances in the past, and have already established many achievements in the history of the national war of resistance.

Last night—the fourth evening—in order to raise more funds for the China Youth Relief Corps to send teams to serve at the front lines, they launched the sixth charity performance, resulting in another page of praiseworthy history being added.

The singing segment raised 2,940-odd yuan, and the flower sales segment raised more than 230 yuan, totaling more than 3,100 yuan. The creators of this historical material should be credited to the several chairpersons of the charity performance, Ms. Mei Lihua, Wan Hongnu, Bao Yudu, and Hua Yinghen.

A very tense election scene unfolded last night at the Tao Yuan Restaurant in Shek Tong Tsui, for the final summing up of the results, and simultaneously for the crowning of a Queen of Song, a Red Star of Song, and a Star of Song. The singing girls, for the sake of saving the country and their position, were all gearing up and competing eagerly.

Mei Lihua, Wan Hongnu, and Hua Yinghen all had the desire to win the championship, especially Wan Hongnu, whose voice was the loudest. Unexpectedly, when the results were announced, Mei Lihua bid 1,117 yuan and won the championship, being crowned "Queen of Song." Wan Hongnu bid 1,030 yuan, placing second, and was crowned "Red Star of Song." Dudu placed third, crowned "Star of Song." Hua Yinghen withdrew. It is said that she transferred most of her achievements to Mei Lihua's account to fulfill her good friend Mei Lihua's dream, but the reporter has not been able to verify whether this is true.

According to Mr. Zheng Dezhi, the leader of the Youth Relief Corps, there will be a somewhat grand coronation ceremony in the near future. The singing girls originally put in their sincere efforts for the country, not for any honors, but as an encouragement for the future, this is certainly something that should be done.

### Drama and Song Concert

— Qi Zhuo

For the Purpose of Building a Public Library

The Chinese Amateur School, which was only established in Kowloon two months ago, held a drama and song concert yesterday morning at the Ping An Theatre for the purpose of building a public library.

Mr. Tao Xingzhi said in the school's special publication that he "used to run a library at Xiaozhuang called the 'No Bookworms Allowed Library'." But, on the one hand, he told bookworms not to come, and on the other hand, why did he want to run a library? He wanted "laborers" and "money-grubbers" to read more books to clear their minds and understand the world. But books are a tool... for use, for solving problems. One must not read them blindly. If we recognize this point, books are the best thing, and we will benefit infinitely from good books."

From this, we can get a glimpse of the purpose of the school's fundraising for a public library: to promote the spirit of providing spiritual nourishment to the public. In Hong Kong society, where the stench of money is everywhere and money-grubbers block the road, this is clearly a very necessary righteous act.

The Ping An Theatre is quite magnificent. In the flickering light, it appears even more beautiful and quiet. When the chairman delivered his speech, the vast circular hall was filled with a solemn atmosphere.

The concert began with the national anthem. Over eighteen hundred people upstairs and downstairs stood in silence, and the majestic singing vibrated through the entire space of the theatre, shaking the heartstrings of the vast audience.

The pitch and rhythm were quite successful technically, and the most beautiful thing was the set of blue cloth gowns and coarse cloth student uniforms worn by the forty or so energetic young men and women in the group. The neat and simple demeanor showed a generous beauty in the collective. It goes without saying that this kind of true and natural beauty is worth promoting in Hong Kong.

The songs that followed were: Blue Sky with a White Sun and Crimson Ground, National Flag Song, July 7th March, Roar, Rise Up to Save the Nation, Defend China, Win Glory for the Country, Go to the Front, National Salvation Song, Charge, and Triumph and other famous songs. The high and low harmony of "Defend China," accompanied by the melodious music, was especially moving to people's hearts.

This time, everyone appreciated the beauty of the songs not only by listening with their ears, but also by staring at the lyrics in the program, which stirred up waves of emotion in their hearts.

After the songs came the drama. The first act was the school's own "New Wu Xun Promotes Righteous School," which was a very necessary educational drama in terms of its meaning. However, it lacked "artistic interest" in the interlacing of the story, so it felt too rigid. The audience who were not accustomed to Mandarin felt it was even more dull.

The first act was "The Eight Hundred Heroes of Zhabei," performed very tensely and vividly. Cantonese easily attracted the attention of the whole audience. The performance of the plot was a great and heroic fact of the war of resistance, which could encourage overseas Chinese to participate in the war of resistance more enthusiastically. The section in which a British friend represented the International Merchant Volunteers to comfort our army was especially suitable for promoting in Hong Kong and Kowloon to promote Sino-British friendship.

"Chinese soldiers are not afraid of death!" "Returning our rivers and mountains is the responsibility of every Chinese person," "..." Many cautionary and heroic words aroused bursts of warm applause. When the bright and glorious national flag was raised, everyone stood up to salute! Sensitive audience members could not help but shed tears.

The third act was "Families Scattered and People Dead." The plot had a strong sense of the war of resistance, and the interest was not low-level, making it the most successful and popular act of this entertainment. The girl Zhan Liheng performed very genuinely and lively, and the audience had a high degree of goodwill towards her.

Finally, everyone stood at attention and sang the national anthem. This brand new entertainment event ended at 1:30.

According to Mr. Fang Yu yan, who spoke to the reporter: there were over one thousand eight hundred guests, and it is estimated that over eight hundred Hong Kong dollars can be raised. After deducting sixty dollars for the theatre rental and over two hundred dollars for other entertainment taxes and various expenses, the library fund can actually obtain a net profit of five to six hundred dollars. This is the beginning of the work, and we will have to find ways to expand it in the future. The reporter, in deep respect, silently wishes for the early establishment of this library, so that the public can obtain some spiritual nourishment.

### Stirring Up a Mania for Dramatic Arts in Macau; Hong Kong Era Drama Troupe Gives Charity Performances in Macau

— Zhu Baishui

Macau, the beautiful name like the Monte Carlo of the East, is completely filled with the atmosphere of a struggle for destiny. All the wills of the people are immersed in tension, entertainment, and constant struggle!

Many people with the hearts of explorers, holding the emotions of seeking stimulation, desperately revolve in this sleepless Macau. They hope to bet their fate in fan-tan, mahjong, roulette, lotteries, and licentiousness. However, the arrangement of fate leads countless people to failure, tragically never to recover—

Similarly, Macau's culture is also tragic and unable to be liberated. It seems that she is eternally numb, and the great and sacred act of resisting the war cannot push her to crawl forward. Macau has the old feudal colors, the same fate as a colony, and even the shadows of our enemies lingering. Therefore, Macau's culture lives stubbornly and cruelly.

The movement of dramatic arts is naturally no exception and has suffered an unfortunate fate. Although Macau's drama workers work desperately, it is a fact that they have failed to grow this seed well. In the recent past, there were four joint performances to raise relief funds, etc. The results were very good, but unfortunately, due to environmental factors, they have recently become quiet again.

Hoping that external forces would stimulate her, push her, this hope flowed in the hearts of Macau's workers. They hoped that external groups would come to Macau to work.

Finally, the flag of the Era Drama Troupe, the only Cantonese professional group that appeared in Hong Kong with a brand-new posture, began to flutter in Macau on December 9th!

The Era Drama Troupe's arrival in Macau is not only to raise funds for the Hong Kong Student Relief Association's Return to China Service Corps and Macau refugees, as the name suggests, but also importantly bears the mission of promoting Macau's dramatic arts and culture!

For this expedition to Macau, the Era Drama Troupe mobilized twenty-seven or eight members to work. Among them were actors on stage, backstage staff, and carpenters. Everyone participated in the work with excitement and enthusiasm.

On the morning of December 9th, they stepped onto the Hong Kong-Macau steamer and left Hong Kong. Lu Dun, Li Chenfeng, Wu Hui, Wang Keng, Zhang Ying, Ou Ai, Li Yueqing, Gao Weilan, and others were all on the journey.

They arrived at this new land at 11:00 AM. The Nan Yuan Hotel became their headquarters. After settling their luggage, they split up to work: inspecting the theatre where they would be staging, contacting the local dramatic arts circles in Macau, purchasing the necessary equipment, etc.

Every day, the last Hong Kong-Macau ferry carried a large amount of scenery and musical instruments for their performance. They personally mobilized to carry her to the dance jujube. Every actor was working so solemnly and diligently. At that time, it was already two o'clock in the deep night.

The next morning was the 10th. Originally, the Macau cultural circles were scheduled to hold a welcome reception for the Era Drama Troupe in the afternoon, but due to time and work, it was impossible to do so. As a result, it could only be postponed!

On the morning of that day, a magnificent advertisement for the Era Drama Troupe's charity performance was hung at the entrance of the most prestigious Victoria Theatre in Macau. Many were also posted on the streets, attracting everyone. The people of Macau were attracted to pay attention, excited, and looking forward to it.

They were very busy setting up the stage. Everyone was working hard. All the lights and decorations were completed with their own strength and effort. From every point of work, they showed that they were diligently, resolutely and struggling for the sake of expanding the field of the dramatic movement. They are contributing people, therefore, are the strength.

What was performed that evening was Cao Yu's famous work "Thunderstorm." It is said that this drama had been performed four or five times in Macau. However, before it started that evening, a wave of audience members had already poured into the theater like a tide. The performance that evening, except for the third act, which did not achieve good results due to Macau's lack of material resources, won boundless applause.

On the afternoon of the 11th, "Thunderstorm" was still performed. The performance was even better than the previous night. What was performed on the evening was You Jing's famous work "Night-Shining Cup". The effect of this drama was very good. The Era Drama Troupe's performance was extremely outstanding, tense, and moving. Every act won thunderous applause. This is a play about the war of resistance, so there are many exciting parts. However, it was reported that there were people from the Japanese spy agency at the venue on the night (Japanese naval commander Shiozawa Minoru visited the Macau Governor), forcing the temporary deletion of many lines. But the enthusiastic applause still majestically vibrated in the theater, shaking the hearts of the audience, and even more shocking the ambitions of the idiots!

Following on the 12th, "Night-Shining Cup" continued to be performed, and then "The Paint is Not Dry" was performed. The above three days were to raise relief funds for the Hong Kong Student Relief Association's Return to China Service Corps and Macau refugees. From the 13th to the 14th, the performances were by the troupe itself, raising funds. On the 13th, it was "The Paint is Not Dry" and on the night it was "Getting Promoted and Making a Fortune" (Demon Cave). On the 14th, it was "Night-Shining Cup" and on the night it was still "Getting Promoted and Making a Fortune."

Macau's dramatic arts scene is silent and desolate. Although there used to be four or five large and small drama troupes, they have completely stopped recently. It was not until recently that Zhang Xuefeng and others organized the "Unnamed Drama Club" to engage in dramatic arts. Undeniably, in this weak Macau drama world, the Era Drama Troupe appeared in a brand-new posture, stimulating this extremely weak phenomenon, giving the Macau drama world a good influence, and giving the people of Macau the best spiritual food.

In the midst of the fires of war spreading throughout the motherland and the fierce fighting of the war of resistance, our drama is not only for art, it should be the best kind of propaganda, it should be the most excellent horn of the times!

I wish the Era Drama Troupe to march forward on this glorious path!

(Macau, 1:13 night)

### Firewood Prices Have Not Fallen; Those Seeking Profit from Firewood Suddenly Increase by a Thousand People; Many Selling Bundles of Firewood in the Central and Wan Chai Areas

Although the supply of firewood in Hong Kong is not as tight as it was a few days ago, its price has not fallen, so it can still be said that the firewood shortage period has not passed. According to investigations by this reporter, there has been a sudden increase of over a thousand people in Hong Kong who are making a living by selling firewood due to the high price of firewood. Numerous women are running firewood businesses in the sundry shops at the end of Lockhart Road in Wan Chai and in the open space next to the Naval Club. There are hundreds of people selling bundles of firewood on the side of the street in Gage Street and the surrounding area in Central every day. The bundles of firewood they sell are not obtained by stealing, but are purchased from firewood shops or firewood boats at a relatively favorable price, broken into small branches, and then sold. According to one of them, they can earn a profit of three or four dimes per dollar.

### Eliminating Unfortunate Incidents; Sports Field Established in Refugee Camp; Improving the Life of Isolated Soldiers; Radio and Library Also Established

Since last Christmas, accidental incidents have occurred frequently among our isolated soldiers residing in the Ma Tau Chung Refugee Camp. The authorities find this regrettable, so they held a meeting last Friday to study and seek good methods to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future. The results of the meeting have not yet been announced, but many believe that the Chinese soldiers' intention to escape is due to the excessively monotonous life in the palace. Therefore, it is believed that the authorities should not only do their utmost to prevent the guarding soldiers from firing, but also take active measures to improve the lives of the Chinese soldiers in the camp and eliminate the occurrence of unfortunate incidents. It has been learned that the Hong Kong Chinese YMCA has obtained permission from the authorities to build a small house in the camp for the isolated soldiers to gather and play. Various sports equipment is gradually being added to the house, including a basketball court and a volleyball court that is under construction. A wireless radio has now been installed in the camp, and the collection of various books and magazines is underway to establish a library for the soldiers to browse in their spare time.

### Gushan Mountain, Fuzhou (5)

— Shao Yanqing

Not far from here is also the Taiyi Cave, but because there is no formal path to it, few people know about it. The cave is above the Lotus Pavilion and requires climbing through grass and branches. The entrance to the cave is very small, just enough to accommodate a person. Inside, it is winding and deep, and after walking ten or twenty steps, it is as dark as pitch, and you cannot see your fingers. It was a pity that I did not bring a candle, so I had to turn back and exit the cave. In the dim twilight, I hurried back to Yongquan Temple.

The next morning, under the warm sunlight, I stepped out of the gate of Yongquan Temple. On the way down the mountain, we took the opportunity to browse the eighteen caves and eighteen scenes of Gushan Mountain. In fact, several of the eighteen caves are in the northern part of Gushan Mountain, which we had already visited the day before. As for the eighteen scenes, many of them are inside the rocks, so we visited all the places in a short time. Of the caves, except for the several in the north of the mountain, the Lotus Pavilion is the largest, and the Dharma Cave and Lü Xian Rock are quite exquisite. Most of these caves do not have the form of caves. Some are simply a few houses with one or two monks living inside. It is said that these people have worked hard in Yongquan Temple for three years without receiving a single penny of "reward money" [note, i.e., wages], so the abbot of the temple looks at them differently and usually does not impose any restrictions on their lives. Only when they commit a major offense can they be dismissed according to the rules [meaning expelled]. The method of dismissal is for the temple to hang a pair of straw sandals on the door of the monk's room, then the other monk will understand. Among the eighteen scenes, the large rock of "Two Armors Unloading Saddles" is more worth seeing. The surface of the stone is printed with ripples like fish scales, which is very realistic, but I do not know whether it was formed by natural erosion.

When passing by Qianfu Nunnery, a young woman with a lithe figure dropped her work from the distant field and hurried over to welcome us to the nunnery. The door was pushed open, and it was quiet and silent inside. In the middle of the nunnery is a rectangular patio, surrounded by single-story houses. The light is still fine, but because the houses and various furniture have not been painted, everything looks bleak and desolate, reflecting the lonely lives lived by these people who have been forgotten by others. It is said that the nunnery was built with funds donated by a wealthy family in Shaowu County, northern Fujian. Any vegetarian woman who pays a settlement fee of five or six hundred yuan can entrust herself to the nunnery, living and eating there for the rest of her life. We also walked around the nunnery quickly and came out.

The sun was still shining gently. We followed the slope of the mountain, walking down the wide stone steps step by step. The scenic beauty of Gushan Mountain also gradually left us step by step. Before long, our feet stepped on the flat Fuma Highway. Looking back at Yongquan Temple, it had disappeared into the pine forests on the mountain. Only the towering peak that pierces into the clouds still stands majestically there, seeming to bid us farewell for the last moment. The ruthless long-distance bus carried us back to Fuzhou City. From then on, the scenic spots of Gushan Mountain can only be tasted in our longing and memories.

### Huangpu River Long and Short Ferries: Entirely Controlled by the Japanese, Foreign and Private Ferries All Eliminated, Ticket Prices Increased Significantly, Profits Abundant

[Shanghai Correspondence] Since the war shifted west, while some foreign ferry companies organized temporary services on the Huangpu River to transport goods, the Japanese-owned Shanghai Ferry Company, backed by its powerful support, gradually eliminated other companies. As of recently, the long-distance ferry routes on the Huangpu River, from Gaoqiao in the north to Zhoujiadu in the south, are entirely managed by the company. The operating routes are even more extensive than those previously run by the Shanghai Xingye Trust Company. Although the puppet "Municipal Government" has a pseudo "Public Works Bureau," it has no authority to advise. The details are recorded as follows:

Merchant-Run and Municipal-Run Ferry Business Along the Banks

Before the end of the Qing dynasty, east-west traffic on the Huangpu River was served by only eight long-distance ferries: Zhoujiadu, Nanmatou, Dongjiadu, Laobaitu, Yangjiadu, Lan Nibo Chunjiangmatou, and Funshanmatu. All were short-distance river crossings, of a commercial nature. After the establishment of the Republic of China, ferry services were expanded to Jiajiajiao, Xidu, Gaomiao, Donggou, Gaoqiao, and Wusong. These were also commercial ventures. Only after the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government in 1927 did the city begin to operate well-equipped and safe long and short-distance municipal ferries. The long-distance ferries included five lines: Wusong, Gaoqiao, Donggou, Gaomiao, and Xidu, all starting from the Beijing Road wharf. The short-distance ferries included five lines: Gaomiao, Qichangzhan, Chunjiangmatou, Dongchang Road, and Dongjiadu. Improved private ferries also operated on three lines: Yangjiadu, Nanmatou, and Zhoujiadu. Therefore, traffic was convenient in all directions, and public travel was exceptionally safe.

Newly Emerging Services Eliminated After the War

After the August 13th Shanghai battle, the Japanese forces first blockaded all ferry crossings and seized ten municipal ferry boats (two had already been sunk by the Chinese). Consequently, at that time, apart from the Dongchang Road, Huajiaxuan, and Nanmatou private ferries that were able to resume operations, only a few newly established foreign ferry companies obtained temporary operating licenses to run long-distance ferry lines to Gaoqiao, Donggou, Gaomiao, and the southern Huangpu areas of Dongjiadu, Nanmatou, Bailianjing, and the Nanshi Dama Wharf. The companies engaged in this business included Dale, Mahler, Fuli, Huitong, Jiangzhe, and Shanghai, among others. The Shanghai company was operated by the Japanese Nissin Company. Competition was fierce. Soon, the Nanshi Dama Wharf line was blocked by the Japanese military, and subsequently, the southern Huangpu lines of Dongjiadu, Nanmatou, and Bailianjing were ordered to cease operations. The northern Huangpu lines of Gaoqiao, Donggou, and Gaomiao were operated exclusively by the Shanghai Company, leveraging the backing of the Japanese forces. Other companies were gradually eliminated and forced to close.

Shanghai Company Exclusively Controls Long-Distance Ferries

After the suspension of the southern Huangpu long-distance ferry lines, transportation to and from the south became quite inconvenient. Therefore, the Japanese Nanhui Pacification Unit established two long-distance ferry lines, Zhoujiadu and Nanmatou, directly to the Jiujiang Road wharf on the Bund in the Public Concession. Two ferry boats, the First and Second Nanhui Maru, were dispatched to shuttle back and forth, charging 30 cents per trip, and the business was quite prosperous. The Shanghai Ferry Company had long coveted these two long-distance ferry lines and lobbied the Japanese Special Service Department for a long time. Until recently, they obtained an operating license, allowing the Shanghai Company to extend its routes to Nanmatou and Zhoujiadu. The long-distance ferry lines to the Public Concession were changed to the Beijing Road wharf (the starting point of the Gaoqiao, Donggou, and Gaomiao lines). Operations officially began a few days ago. The Nanmatou and Zhoujiadu long-distance ferry lines operated by the Nanhui puppet unit were simultaneously discontinued. Consequently, the long-distance ferry routes on both the northern and southern Huangpu River are exclusively controlled by the Japanese Shanghai Company.

High Fares, Huge Monthly Profits

After the Shanghai Company obtained this exclusive operating right, considering the fares set for each line, except for the Nanmatou and Zhoujiadu lines, where the former municipal ferry did not operate, so there was no precedent to follow, the fares for the three northern Huangpu lines, such as Gaoqiao, were exceptionally high. The Gaoqiao line charged $1.20 for first class, 80 cents for second class, and 40 cents for third class. The Donggou line charged 90 cents for first class, 60 cents for second class, and 30 cents for third class. The Gaomiao line charged 60 cents for first class, 40 cents for second class, and 20 cents for third class. Compared to the former municipal ferry, the fares are more than doubled. The ferry boats used are all ten former municipal ferry boats that were seized, repainted, and renamed. Five boats, Donggou, Xidu, Dongchang, Dinghai, and Weisai, are used for the southern Huangpu lines, and five boats, Wusong, Gaoqiao, Jiangsu, Songjiang, and Chunjiang, are used for the northern Huangpu lines, rotating on duty. The total daily expenditure is 600 yuan, while the total daily ticket sales for all lines are approximately 1200 yuan, which covers both costs and profits. Therefore, the monthly profit is estimated to be around 20,000 yuan.

The Puppet Regime Covets Profits, Dream Unrealized

Since the Shanghai puppet "Supervisory Office" was changed to the puppet "Municipal Government" and the original puppet "Transportation Bureau" was changed to the puppet "Public Works Bureau," the puppet "Mayor" Bo Xiaoan coveted this large income. He made informal requests to the Japanese to reclaim the business and operate it as a "municipal enterprise." However, this request was not fulfilled. It is said that Xiaoan was still unwilling to give up. Recently, he submitted a plan to his superiors in the puppet "Renovation Government," so the puppet "Premier" Liang Hongzhi again proposed the idea of taking over the business to the Japanese side. The Japanese side refused, citing the high profits from each route, shattering the puppet regime's dream.

Existing Private Ferries Mostly Blocked

As for the original private ferries on the Huangpu River, the Japanese, citing military reasons, have not allowed the reopening of any lines except for the three across the river at Dongchang Road, Dongjiadu, and Nanmatou due to the blockade of ferry crossings. Therefore, the Zhoujiadu, Laobaitu, Yangjiadu, Chunjiangmatou, Funshanmatou, Qichangzhan, Jiajiajiao, Xidu, Gaomiao, Donggou, and Gaoqiao cross-river ferry lines have been unable to resume operations to this day. Thousands of ferrymen who depended on this for their livelihood have been unemployed for over a year, and their lives are barely sustained in hardship. The tragic situation is beyond what outsiders can imagine.

### Special Shipping News

The Ming Sang of the Xiaodian Steamship Company, originally the Haili, a disguised vessel of the Japanese China Merchants Bureau, has been undergoing repairs at the Kowloon Dockyard since being purchased by Jardine Matheson & Co. It is now reported that the ship is nearing completion and will set sail for Shantou, Shanghai, Yantai, Tianjin, and other places at the end of this month.

The Albre Sarraut, formerly a French postal ship managed by the local agency, used to travel to Hong Kong, Saigon, and Haiphong. However, it has been rerouted to other lines for several years and has not been seen locally. According to news yesterday, the ship recently ran aground in the Philippines at Hanmei (transliteration). A distress signal was sent to Little Luzon and the surrounding area. The telegram stated that the ship was hit by violent storms during the voyage and could not be controlled, leading to the accident. The extent of the loss is yet to be reported.

### After the Fall of Guangzhou: What I Saw on the Guangdong-Guangxi Road (1) – Refugees Overcrowded, Many Dead and Injured, All Counties and Towns Bombed

Wuzhou Correspondence: When Guangzhou fell, I escaped danger from the crowd of refugees by crossing the river and walking west. I passed through Shunde, Panyu, Nanhai, Sanshui, Gaoming, and Gaoyao, and then went west along the river into Guangxi. Along the way, I was delayed due to transportation difficulties, or stayed temporarily in various markets and villages, inquiring about the situation. Therefore, it took me more than twenty days to reach Guangxi. Now, I will describe what I saw and heard along the way.

Guangzhou unfortunately fell on January 21st, under the defense of Yu Hanmou, the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army. That night, when Guangzhou's life was in peril, I decided to leave the city, crossed the river from Huangsha to Fangcun. When I arrived at the Haibudu wharf after crossing Huangsha, I saw city residents, young and old, carrying their belongings, crowding and scrambling to cross the river. Shouting and crying mingled together. The stores were also moving their goods out of the city, either to the dams around the villages, across Fangcun, or to the riverbanks. Cars, trucks, and rickshaws filled the roads, leaving pedestrians with almost no room to move. In the midst of the shouting and pushing, an air raid alarm suddenly sounded, and all the lights in the city went out. The refugees were even more panicked and embarrassed. The bodies of the old, weak, men, women, and children who fell into the water or were suffocated to death were found along the seaside wharfs. I hired a small sampan for five silver dollars and crossed from Huangsha to Fangcun. By the time I landed, it was already past 9 p.m. Looking at the Huangsha station on the north bank, there were shadowy figures everywhere. Suddenly, the sound of machine guns burst out near the station, as dense as firecrackers during the New Year, lasting for about twenty minutes. At that time, several locomotives were firing up in the station, waiting for orders. Troops and military supplies and heavy weapons were piled up like mountains before and after the station, waiting to be loaded and retreat north along the Guangdong-Han Railway. That night, Guangzhou's order had fallen into chaos.

South of the river, there were two roads that refugees had to take to evacuate (there were no boats that day, only land routes). One was to go along the Guangdong-Sanshui Railway to Sanshui, and the other was to go from Fangcun via Zhaocun and Pingzhou to Chancun. Therefore, if the refugees could cross the river, they could take either route. After arriving at Fangcun, I heard that the road to Shiwitang was extremely crowded because most refugees thought that there were trains to transport them from Shiwitang, and even if the trains were too crowded, they could walk along the railway. Therefore, there were especially many refugees on this road. The trains ran all night, once every two hours, but could not carry everyone. There were too many walkers along the railway to count. I decided that the vehicles on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway were often attacked by planes, which would inevitably cause congestion, danger, and difficulties for us civilians to board. So I changed my direction and went west on another road, leaving Fangcun on foot early on the 21st, taking the route to Zhaocun, Pingzhou, and directly to Chancun. Unexpectedly, there were also tens of thousands of refugees on this road, all aiming to reach Chancun as a temporary destination. It was about fifty miles from Fangcun to Chancun (belonging to Shunde). Along the way, the villages had self-defense forces on guard and guiding the way. There were no extra demands on the various ferries across the water, and the order was good. Halfway there, I heard loud explosions from Guangzhou. At 12 noon, three Japanese planes came and dropped several bombs on the Bijiang Haikou in Chancun New Market, destroying the Huian tile kiln. They also dropped several bombs on the Lintou Station (connecting to the Daliang Highway), killing or injuring five or six people. It is said that this was the first time Japanese planes bombed Chancun. The people in the market were very frightened. The distance between Guangzhou and Chancun is forty or fifty miles, but it only takes two hours by boat. Since Guangzhou had fallen, Chancun could not be considered safe. At that time, there were two refugee camps in the market, but because there were too many people, they could not accommodate them. The vacant ancestral halls in the market and the streets and alleys were filled with refugees, eating in the open and sleeping in the streets, in a very miserable state. After nightfall, the sound of artillery and bombs from Guangzhou could be heard all night. On the morning of the 22nd, about one hundred policemen from the Guangzhou Police Department and hundreds of military and political officials fled to Chancun, or moved to Daliang. It is said that on the morning of the 21st, there were no soldiers or police to maintain order in the city, and the entire city was in chaos. Traitors and local ruffians took the opportunity to steal and set fires. Until the night of the 22nd, the fire had not stopped. Looking north from Zhencun, the sky was red. That day, the police station in the market ordered all the ships along the river to sail to Sanshui Estuary to prevent the Japanese from using them. The population of the market was also ordered to evacuate. The entire market's commerce was at a standstill.

Early on the 23rd, I left Chancun and headed west, intending to stay overnight at Guanshan Market in Xiqiao. Guanshan is about sixty miles from Chancun. Along the way, I passed through Lecun in Shunde and Jili in Nanhai before reaching Guanshan. In the middle, I passed Lecun. The highway bridge next to the market (the Tingfu Highway) had been blown up the day before (the 22nd). According to a local official, all eleven iron bridges on the Jiang-Fo Highway were ordered to be blown up on the 22nd. The vehicles on the road that had not been transferred were also completely disassembled, removing the wheels and important parts, and parked in various villages. Therefore, traffic on the road was completely shut down. However, the people of Lecun were still calm as usual, and the stores were operating as usual. Because of the increased refugee population, business was even more lively. Most people did not know that Guangzhou had fallen. In the teahouses and restaurants, some people talked about the fall of Guangzhou, but most did not believe it, thinking that the Guangdong army had a very strong fighting power and had been building defenses for more than a year. Even if the Japanese army attacked fiercely, they would be able to resist desperately, and even if they were not strong enough, they would be able to hold on for a month or two. However, the ideal and the reality were the opposite. When I reached Jili, the situation was the same as Lecun. When I arrived at Guanshan, the sun was setting and the sky was getting dark. There were about twenty small electric boats and tugboats moored on the Guanshan River, most of which were sealed off by the authorities for dispatch. Most of the staff of the Nanhai County Government and the County Party Headquarters had come to the market, as well as merchants from Guangzhou, Foshan, Chancun, Lanshi, and other places. For a time, the population of Guanshan increased sharply, and business was also abnormally prosperous. Although the market belonged to Nanhai, it was located on the western edge and at the foot of Xiqiao Mountain, so the transportation was not important. Therefore, for more than a year of the war, Japanese planes had not come to harass it. The refugees thought it was a safe place. Unexpectedly, Japanese planes bombed it on the 24th, and the losses were incalculable. (To be continued)

### Maintaining China's Trade Position, Encouraging the Export of Local Products, Exempting Transit and Export Taxes, and Providing Full Transportation Convenience

After the Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission made great efforts to adjust the market prices of local products and promote exports, goods that needed to be settled in foreign exchange were exempted from export tax. At this time of war, in order to maintain the overseas trade position of the main local products, every effort was made to manage tung oil, silk, tea, etc., to increase production and sell them abroad. The details are as follows:

Incentives for Exports

### South China's Expedition to Vietnam: A Night Victory in Southern Vietnam, Chen Dehui Scores Two Goals in a Row, Li Zhaorong and Yang Shuiyi Each Score One Goal, Southern Vietnam Team Plans to Come to Hong Kong for Competition in the New Year

(Special Report from this Newspaper) Yesterday afternoon at around 5 o'clock, the South China Association received another victory report from the front.

On the 14th, the South China Football Team played its fourth match since arriving in Vietnam, playing against the local Southern Vietnam B Team at night. The members of South China performed very well, and Southern Vietnam also made good contributions. The fans in the stadium sighed in admiration.

After a fierce competition, South China once again achieved a satisfactory result, defeating the strong enemy with a score of 4-2, ending this night battle. Chen Dehui scored two goals in a row, and Li Zhaorong and Yang Shuiyi each scored one goal.

South China was invited by the Southern Vietnam team to Vietnam. Old friends met again, and they were happy to talk about the past. How happy they must have been!

According to Zhu Zhaohang's letter, the entire South China army received warm hospitality from the host after arriving in Vietnam, and their kindness was touching.

The host learned that Hong Kong football has been doing very well recently, so they consulted with Mo Qing, the coach of the South China army, about the possibility of coming to Hong Kong for competition again during the Lunar New Year period.

Regarding this matter, both parties are in discussions. If it happens, the fans on the island will really be in for a treat! (Dong Lang)

### The First Battle of South China's Expedition to Vietnam: Chen Dehui's Bravery Commendable, Three Central Defenders Also Give a Good Performance

(Saigon, 8th, Airmail Special Dispatch) The South China Football Team was invited by the Saigon Football Association and traveled to Saigon with a group of nineteen people. We arrived at the port on the morning of the 5th on the "Li Men" ship. The sea journey took three and a half days, during which we encountered wind and waves, and six members of the team suffered from seasickness and could not eat. Fortunately, the Hong Kong athletes attending the Saigon Far East Tennis Tournament were on the same ship, so we did not feel lonely during the journey. The captain of the "Li Men" specially allowed us to practice jumping rope and calisthenics on deck, so we did not reduce our training time during the three and a half day voyage. The ship docked on the morning of the 9th, and the president and staff of the Saigon Football Association, as well as representatives from all walks of life in the Chinese community, gathered at the pier to welcome us. This shows how much the Chinese community admires the Iron Army of South China and expects us to fight against the local strong teams in Saigon to vent their frustrations. When foreign guests arrive in Saigon, they must go through strict customs procedures and have their luggage checked. Fortunately, our team was spared this troublesome procedure. Our team was the first to disembark after the ship docked. The team is staying in a grand Chinese hotel called "Dahua," which is a magnificent building similar to the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong. In addition to the usual social events, tea parties, dinner parties, and practices, the players go to bed at 9 pm every night.

First Battle After Arrival

The first battle was held on the afternoon of the 7th against the French Athletes Team, a strong team in Saigon. An Ding, the famous right winger who besieged Hong Kong in the spring, and his inner auxiliaries all attended. The game was extremely tense, and the audience was eager to see the performance of the South China team. The number of spectators was quite crowded. South China was naturally cautious in facing this first tough battle. Before the game, Team Leader Mo encouraged the team members, and we all went to the field to cheer them on. As a result, we relied on the hard work of our warriors and took the lead with a score of seven to four. Chen Dehui scored four goals, Li Zhaorong scored two, and Luo Douwen scored one. In this game, the French League team once took the lead with a score of three to two in the first half. When the whole team attacked, they often increased their speed, which made it difficult for the central defenders of South China to intercept them. An Ding, the executioner, was one of the best performers in the French League team. However, in the second half, the French League team collapsed after a slight setback, and finally surrendered. On the South China team, the central defender line performed the best. Liu Qingcai's headers were like a road, and Dehui and Zhaorong were the most outstanding in the forward line. Shuiyi's performance was not satisfactory. What surprised us most was that in Saigon football, players can be substituted at any time, and they can enter the field at any time without having to notify the referee.

Three to One in the First Half

Only eight minutes after the start, Shentui passed the ball low, and Li Beirong scored the first goal. Five minutes later, the French League forward rushed to shoot, sending the ball to the right of the goal, which only Zhang Rongcai could save. At this time, the two sides tied at one to one. After about twenty minutes, the League launched an attack, and An Ding cut in. Zhongwei arrived in time and picked the ball over Rong's head, making it two to one. At that time, Rongcai abandoned the goal and made a desperate move, but it was not effective. At this time, the French League took the lead, and the Vietnamese fans were inexplicably happy, shouting and cheering, thinking that they could win. Unexpectedly, the South China generals performed exceptionally well, and the central defenders gave a wonderful performance. Chen Dehui rushed out like a tiger, breaking through the enemy's encirclement, making it two to two.

Dehui is Brave and Good at Fighting

Before the end of the half, the German army waved its iron legs and took the lead with three to two. An Ding's siege was really powerful, scoring a goal with a header. In the first half, the score was three to three, and the outcome was undecided. The second half was the world of South China. In terms of coordination, there was pure cooperation. After about ten minutes, Dehui gave another outstanding performance and scored a goal, and South China took the lead again with four to three. Li Zhaorong made it five to three, and Luo Douwen waited for a very good opportunity. Without waiting for the ball to fall, he hit the ball into the net with his left leg, making it six to three. Finally, An Ding of the French League scored a goal in the chaos, and Dehui completed the score of seven to four. The South China lineup is as follows: (Recorded by Zhu Zhaodan)

### Pui Ying's Bravery Unmatched, Wins Three Games Straight Against South China, the Championship Title Belongs to Pui Ying

The Da Sheng Cup Volleyball Tournament was held yesterday (the 15th) at 3:30 PM at the Pou Kong Village Road Playground between Pui Ying and South China. Pui Ying has been invincible since its establishment, and South China is also a leader in the team. The two teams met on this day, both with the determination to win. Both sides arranged their best players, and the audience also thought that the two teams were evenly matched and would have a fierce battle, so they flocked to the scene, which was extremely crowded. After the two teams began to compete, their strength was evenly matched and the battle was intense. Qiu Guangxie and Yu Qi'en performed excellently, but South China's middle and rear ranks were quite weak in defense, which allowed Pui Ying's army to attack and break through the front line with lightning speed. South China lost with a score of zero to three, and the championship title of this year will belong to Pui Ying. The battle situation is as follows:

After the referee blew the whistle to start the game, Yu Qi'en of South China used both spikes and blocks, and gained some success. Hu Yaodong also occasionally fired, and Pui Ying was forced back. Qiu Guangxie opened fire from both sides, and every shot hit the mark. Yu Qi'en, Hu Yaodong, Li Baotian, and others resisted desperately and tried their best to defend. The score was 21 to 21, and the battle situation was spectacular and exciting. South China finally lost because of occasional gaps in the middle defense, which allowed Qiu Guangxie to take advantage of the situation. They won the first game 26 to 24. South China was determined to recover the lost ground. Li Zhenzhong joined the battle group, and Wu Shuangbai and Hu Yaodong were also very active. However, Chen Jiao of Pui Ying did not move, and Li Lianze and Qiu Guangxie frequently launched spikes, which made it impossible for South China's front row to resist. At the end of this game, South China lost again with a score of 18 to 21. However, South China suffered one loss after another, and the morale of the army was not stable. After the start of the third game, Yu Qi'en, Hu Yaodong, and others frequently waved their hands, and the situation seemed to improve. However, Pui Ying saw that victory was in sight and did not want to fail, so they worked hard and won again with a score of 21 to 18. The two lineups are as follows:

### Shortcut to Fitness (1)

— Wang Xuecheng

Everyone has a love for beauty, but everyone's aesthetic concept is different. What most people consider to be a fit body does not necessarily contain the ingredients of "health". However, a healthy body must contain the "beauty" of "fitness". If we want true "fitness and beauty", we only need to aim at "fitness" and move towards it.

True fitness and beauty can only be achieved through sports methods. The scope of sports is very wide, but the most important of these is exercise. Among the various sports, the most effective are calisthenics and equipment exercises.

If you want to obtain true "fitness and beauty" in a short period of time, you must pay attention to the following points:

(1) Get plenty of rest, sleep, and nutrition.

(2) Exercise for at least fifteen minutes every day.

(3) Bathe at least twice a week. It would be better if you can bathe once a day.

(4) Drink plenty of clean water to keep the intestines clean.

(5) Do more deep breathing, walking, and sunbathing.

(6) Always maintain the correct body posture.

(7) Mental hygiene—do not be depressed, avoid anger, be optimistic, be energetic, and think positively.

When engaging in fitness exercises, you must first focus on the exercise of the trunk, especially women should do more of this extreme exercise. But we must not neglect the average development of the body. The various exercises introduced here can not only exercise the trunk, but also have the effect of promoting the average development of the body. However, it is more suitable for people who already have a strong foundation or whose trunks are well exercised, and the effect is also greater.

As for the order of the exercises, we will temporarily adopt the simplest method, without distinguishing the parts to be exercised. There are about five exercises introduced each time. We only need to continue practicing the exercises introduced each time for about three days. Then, we will change to the exercises introduced next time. After two or three months, it is best to change to practicing different exercises every day. When all the exercises have been done, we will return to the old exercises. At this time, we should start paying attention to the parts of the body that are more underdeveloped and formulate more complex exercise programs to try to make the more underdeveloped parts catch up with the more advanced parts.

The exercises introduced this time focus on the back, waist, buttocks, and legs, and can also improve the body's flexibility. They are also very effective for internal exercises.

(1) Stand upright, extend both arms straight above the head, keep both feet together, and do not bend the knees. Then, bend the lower body forward as far as possible until the fingers touch the toes. Exhale when the upper body bends forward and inhale when standing upright. Do this twenty or fifteen times.

In addition to developing the muscles of the back, lower back, and abdomen, this exercise can also stretch the back muscles and the tendons of the back of the thighs, making the body flexible (to be continued).

### Movies and Theater

Entertainment…Social Gangster

The Last Gansster

Edward Robinson plays a gangster. His success in his past works proves that he is a talented person. His superb acting skills and subtle character portrayals have won unanimous praise from every audience.

In this film, he once again plays a gangster who does all kinds of evil, kills and loots, and ignores the laws of the country. He indulges in the evil forces of the entire society, dominates the world, deceives and indulges, and is invincible. But in the end, for the sake of his wife and children, he sacrifices everything, including his own life, and gets an extremely tragic end.

Edward's acting skills in this film are full of sparks of talent and have an extraordinary touching power. James Stewart and Ruth Shattanam co-star. At the same time, in this film, we also see a perfect Hollywood rogue actor list. All the tense and moving plots in this "social gangster's heart" will give the audience a large and strong new stimulus.

Queen's Peace…Fishing Boat Battle Blood

Spawn of tne North

A movie adapted from a famous literary work, depicting the life of the islanders on the Alaska Peninsula in the northern border of the United States and the Arctic Ocean. It is a place where a large number of "salmon" are produced, but the fishermen who make a living by fishing must make great efforts to overcome all natural and man-made difficulties, such as icebergs floating on the sea and the rampant fishing thieves, to maintain their interests. In their lives full of love and hate, there are many touching stories.

This film tells the story of two good friends who, due to conflicts of fishing interests, one cooperates with fishing thieves and the other stands on the side of the fishermen's self-defense group. Good friends become enemies, and behind them are women who deeply love them, who are helpless and watch them fight each other. Later, the one who collaborated with the pirates was finally injured and repented, and deliberately crashed the pirate ship under the iceberg, dying with the fishing thieves, sacrificing himself, and perfecting his friend, as the climax of the film.

The photography technique of this film is lively and clever. There are also several shots of Indian sacrificial ceremonies, which, in our opinion, are full of mysterious meaning. At the same time, this film has five stars, starring Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda, and Dorothy Lamour, and co-starring Akim Tamiroff and John Barrymore. The arrangement of the plot gives everyone the opportunity to give full play to their artistic talents. Director Henry Hathaway has directed films such as "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine" and "The Real Glory". He is very good at handling the plot and the climax of this film and has the power to control the audience's emotions.

Oriental…Weird Bachelor

Professor Beware

After Harold Lloyd starred in "Safety Last!", he gave us a very bad impression due to the insulting China relationship. For a while, no movies came to China. The "Professor Beware" this time is still the same style as before in terms of performance. The plot is fanciful, and there are only a few thrilling places. His silly actions only make people laugh. Naturally, there are also many humorous scenes and dialogues.

Dahua…Tarzan's Revenge

Tarzan's Rvenge

The story is mediocre, telling the story of an explorer who wants to capture white people deep into the Fengyi area. The king colludes with the natives and wants to kidnap "white women". Fortunately, Tarzan tries to help, and later the white woman falls in love with Tarzan and never returns.

The performance is not surprising at all, far inferior to the "Tarzan and His Mate" starring Grant Maris and Eleanor Holm.

Scene Star...Six Female Singers

Wklkfng Down Broadway

Describing six female singers who are like sisters, once they are separated, they all feel reluctant because they have been together for a long time. Finally, they agree to meet again on New Year's Eve next year. However, after being scattered, different fates lead to different encounters, joys and sorrows, which are handled very completely.

Central…Love Tears and Blood Mandarin Film

It is adapted from Xu Qin's original work and directed by Bu Wancang. It can be said to be easy to get married. The protagonist is still played by Jin Yan, but the female protagonist and the rest of the supporting roles have been replaced by Ai Mei Yun and Mei Xi.

The story is simple to say, it is about a woman in a feudal society who repeatedly tried to struggle and finally ended her life with self-sacrifice.

In terms of performance, it can be said to be a work of medium meaning. It is the "Poor Mother" opera, because it is too long, it destroys the emotions of the whole play. The performances of Hui Yan, Yuan Meixun, and Hai Xi are all good.

New World…Spring Love Fire Cantonese Film

The film tells about the inside story of a big hotel, the strange social dynamics, and the deformed development of society. After watching it, there is a great feeling. This film is the first production of Justice Public, starring Star Duan Shanxiao and Chen Yunshang.

### Thinking of the Front

— Ling Song

The cold night in the country, relying on the regulation of the foreign wind, is not considered cold, but it is always colder than usual.

It was late at night, and the later it got, the colder it got. I, who was scratching with a pen under the light, seemed a little overwhelmed.

"Useless thing," I scolded myself, "You can't hold on in such weather?"

Put down the pen. I walked back and forth in the house with my hands in my sleeves. I thought of the soldiers on the front line in the cold night. In the situation of "a frozen beard, a hesitant warhorse", the soldiers had to fight not only against demons, but also against nature. From supplies to clothing, from daily life to working hours, they were suffering all the time, working hard day and night. In this cold and gloomy night, maybe there was a joyful victory for the soldiers, maybe fresh red blood would flow on the white snow, a mixture of red and white. For the freedom of the country and the liberation of the nation, they are struggling hard in the cold night.

-Useless thing-I scolded myself again in my heart. Thinking of the hardships of the soldiers on the front line, I really dared not be lazy, and the pen continued to scratch under the dim light.

A gust of cold wind sent a burst of hoarse Huqin sound. Intermittently mixed with some girls' singing. No, it was sobbing. I imagined that the cold wind was mercilessly attacking her. Her thin clothes could not bear the tyranny of the wind god, and her body trembled a little. Even her singing voice trembled.

"The iron hooves of the X people have covered my hometown, but the whip of life has driven her to the streets. Poor, this cold night street!" I thought in my heart bewilderedly.

My mind was filled with compatriots sleeping under the building, children who had lost their parents in the wilderness, those stragglers in the ends of the earth, those homesick people who could not get news from their fallen hometowns, and those faces that were scorched yellow due to insufficient nutrition, thin limbs, spines bent by the burden of life, and the sobbing sounds trembling in the cold wind...

Who gave us this pain?

I opened the window and saw two long, thin shadows moving under the road. Staggering, they were playing the intermittent singing and the hoarse Huqin sound.

From the neighborhood came a burst of jazz music. The rapid, bouncing, heart-wrenching melody could be imagined as the mood and life of some people. There are not a few of these people on the island. The jazz music has covered up the sounds of cannons and bombs that they have experienced, and they no longer remember them. The smiling faces and red makeup of women cover up the fresh red blood stained on the land of the motherland. Green jade-like wine glasses are filled with red wine. Strong lights and intoxicating aromas are exchanged. The gunpowder smell surrounding the island is dispelled.

Drink, drink, forget the hometown, forget the motherland. They don't seem to be descendants of the Yellow Emperor.

The coldness cannot get rid of "on the one hand, serious work, on the other hand, licentiousness and shamelessness." In the trenches, there are people's liberation soldiers who endure hardships and fight desperately; on this prosperous island, there are also people who enjoy themselves, are selfish and self-interested. There are also batches of compatriots who are suffering the pain of the great era and wandering in the cold night streets.

### Cherishing Talent

— Yu Yiping

In this day and age, finding a means of survival is truly difficult. Not having an education is unacceptable, but even with one, it doesn't guarantee success. The ×× Refugee Industrial Cooperative, established to not necessarily serve the nation, announced the recruitment of fifty female members, attracting over one hundred and fifty applicants. The examination was divided into three parts: oral test, written test, and technical test. The written test question was "The relationship between the victory of the War of Resistance and refugee production." It is said that many applicants had received higher education and possessed university diplomas. However, the committee members, believing that their "skills should not be limited to small crafts," did not accept them. As the newspaper aptly stated, "Do not apply as a refugee if you cannot write. If you can write, you are not allowed to be a refugee."

The committee members' painstaking efforts to cherish talent are truly commendable. University graduates are capable of doing many things. Why should they be asked to do small crafts, thus limiting their future? To use great talent for small tasks is to underestimate our university education, which is, of course, unacceptable. However, this further proves the uselessness of our university education. Because these university graduates probably ran into walls everywhere with their diplomas before coming to the ×× Industrial Cooperative. But now, they don't even have the qualifications to do small crafts. Who would have expected that?

Cherishing talent does not mean preventing someone from doing small things, but rather promoting them to do great things. To truly cherish talent, one must educate them well, so that they not only excel in their studies but are also useful and can be employed.

### Cold

— Lie Ke

Although the season has turned to winter, the feeling of cold is still so faint. In the south, cold seems to be shut out of doors. That biting north wind, that hard ice, those snowflakes as large as white butterflies… those cheerleaders of the cold night, those crystallized products of the cold, needless to say, have vanished without a trace. Even the thinnest layer of frost has no chance of descending—cold and the South can be said to be completely isolated!

Recently, I have not been threatened by the cold. I have not even worn the clothes one should wear in the cold, and I have not felt even a little bit of cold. This almost makes me disbelieve that it is winter. I look at the newly placed calendar on my desk, and at the thermometer on the wall. Past experience tells me, "The season and the climate are too unharmonious!"

People who have grown up in the North since childhood do not find the cold as terrible as Southerners imagine—they do have a special tolerance for the cold. They also have a unique appreciation and preference for the scenery of the cold season. That white earth covered with snow, that silver-white snow and the piercing light it reflects, that completely frozen ditches, that grove of trees filled with light through their branches, that old crow searching for food in the cold, emitting a sad cry, that… every scene, every object is forever dreamed of by the people of the North!…

Now, I am unfortunately living in the South. What I can see every day is a vast sea and Victoria Peak, as dull as a clumsy ox. The tones are always so simple, the trees are also so green, stagnant, and lonely. I can't see even a bit of change, and I can't tell the difference between the summer and winter scenery... I know that this is because of the lack of cold. Therefore, I further understand the greatness of cold, and the amazing transformative and changing power of cold! I do not agree with the saying that "cold is cruel, it will wither plants." On the contrary, I think that 'withering plants' cannot be considered cruel, but is precisely its greatness. Think, if it were not like this, how would trees develop strong and solid branches? They might be as lax as those grown in the tropics. If it were not like this, how could there be tender buds and willow green in spring? How could there be a lush green in summer? And how could there be yellow leaves and red maple in autumn?...

The trees grown in the realm of cold are extraordinarily hard; the herbs grown in the realm of cold have roots that are particularly strong; and the people grown in the realm of cold are all outstandingly brave! Cold is, after all, the touchstone of all things. It will eliminate the weak and degenerate; it will sing to the unyielding lonely pine! Cold weather is also the night of all things. It will instruct trees, insects, and animals to sleep well and rest well! Preparing for the coming spring, how to develop and grow!

Cold is not terrible! It does not have the frivolousness of summer heat, the indulgence of spring harmony, or the desolation of autumn coolness. Its only characteristic is seriousness. People who love seriousness should welcome it!

### Random Notes on the March

— Li Huiying

Day of Departure

The troops were moving from the vicinity of the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway towards E'dong, originally intended as the reserve team for the eastern route. The temporary task was to prepare for the defense of the Ba River line. To gain practical defense experience on the banks of the Ba River, a river defense exercise was also planned. Everything was prepared, except for the date of the exercise. Suddenly, orders for departure were received. It was on September 1st that the order came down from the regimental headquarters all the way to the division headquarters. The exercise was called off as the troops were to begin marching on the 1st.

Staying in one place for too long easily causes boredom, especially among soldiers. They seem to all have restless bodies. Walking a certain distance each day and getting some exercise is not something they fear. Asking them to stay in one place for a long time is more unbearable than being in prison. Moreover, since the troops arrived on the Ba River line, due to acclimatization issues and the rampant mosquitoes, seven out of ten soldiers fell ill. The desire to depart had long been brewing among the soldiers. They even expressed it in Henan dialect, sadly and resentfully cursing:

"Damn it, is a man really supposed to die in this unpleasant place? Damn it!" (To be continued)

### Rushing to the Lotus Ancient Temple at Night

— Shu Lun

Two big guys, two small guys, there were four of us in total.

I and Ying, the two small ones, walked in front; Wan Xiangping, the two big ones, followed behind. The emptiness of the night made us feel extremely cold. The plains lying under the night sky seemed as if they had just died. The slender bamboo forests stood straight and stiff. The surface of the pond no longer had rippling wrinkles. It lay flat, like the face of a melancholy middle-aged widow. Only the weeds, washed by the misty dew in a refreshing bath, appeared particularly lively, reflecting the fish-scale-like dewdrops attached to them. However, we trampled them down with every step, so that their bodies returned to their former dirty state.

The slightest sound, even if it is not worth paying attention to, exceptionally attracted our attention, because the surroundings were all dead objects, and only our shadows were moving.

Cowardly and afraid of the dark, people are equally afraid of traveling at night. They anxiously pondered: 'Snakes will crawl out with their curved bodies to bite people's ankles.' With this added reason, greater terror also grew.

"We don't have torches to scare away bears. How can we scare them if they rush out of the forest?"

Thinking of this, we became even more frightened. We cleared our noses and looked at the road we were about to walk that night, and our courage grew a little.

So, we also said a word of encouragement to ourselves:

'There's still a long way to go!'

Quickly, we left the village surrounded by bamboo forests in the dark night, and immediately rushed to another village.

The paddy fields had long been harvested. After grazing, the gradually solidified soil was loosened by the plows dragged by yellow cattle. Between the fields, a narrow path was cut, so narrow that there could be no narrower path, as a passageway for pedestrians.

We were on the path, as if stepping on a single thread, almost rolling out of the gap.

The lush wild forest grown under the devil's hand of the night confused our direction. The villagers seemed to deliberately avoid the dark night. As soon as it got dark, they all hid in their homes, but we, lost, were outside their doors asking them.

An old woman responded and came out to the doorway. She used a lot of effort to repeat the well-known path:

'Go around this bamboo forest, and you can go straight to Lotus Ancient Temple.' Her overly long sleeves tugged at her elbow, drew a circle, and then pointed sharply in a direction.

Thanking her, we stepped onto many small paths in the bamboo forest, approaching an unfamiliar village.

The self-defense team member guarding the village entrance shouted the passing password: "Password!"

"Combat Team Three!"

"Where are you going?"

"Target! Lotus Temple!"

When we approached him, he stepped forward to inspect us.

Passing the post where he was originally standing, a group of young farmers were talking about interesting things in front of a house. When they suddenly noticed us, one of the kind elders came out to inquire about our comings and goings.

We did not expect any of them to stop our progress. On the contrary, we were pleased with the village's careful security and vigilance.

"We Chinese people have started doing things we have never done before."

In fact, there are many more things we should be grateful for after being happy. Relying on the kind guidance of the elders, we were not lost a second time in the vast dark night.

'Where can we get out to the main road and go straight to Lotus Temple?'

"Yes, I'll take you out."

So, this loyal elder became our leader, crossing mountains and wading through water along the way, as agile as a sea eagle.

He was enlightened. He said many things that we no longer needed to explain to him. On the contrary, there was also something that we would remember for a long time, and that was a pure and thoughtful heart for young people.

When he stopped, he pointed to the distance and said. "It's not far from where you want to go."

We shook off our brave spirits again and rushed straight to that ancient-faced temple.

### Berlin Women's Fashion

— Cheng Qing

You must not forget that Hitler is an artist, a very decent painter. He once personally designed his own bedroom, and this spring, a "New Epang Palace" was completed. Not only that, he also painstakingly prepared the new outfits for German women in 1939. These outfits are said to be very "glorious." This "glory" is as outstanding as tightening your belt to make artillery.

On the streets of Berlin, perhaps in front of a cheese shop, you can see a group of young girls waving their big buttocks and shaking their fat chests. In this "great procession," each one wears bronze, silver, and gold cross-shaped badges on their chests. This is the new teaching for German women in 1939, conceived by the scheming artist Hitler.

The waist of the new outfit is very fat, designed for women with large hips who have had many children. Because their leader wants them to have many children, six, seven, eight, nine... the more the better, the more "glorious." However, this "glory" is unfortunately not well understood even by the women themselves. With an unemployed husband at home and several starving children, why have so many more children? Why is giving birth to many children a "glorious" thing? If there are more children, then the "tails" lined up in front of the bakery and cheese shop will be longer, and it will take longer to wait when buying things. Haven't German butter and food already been taken to feed artillery? Because of the lack of butter, even General Goering has lost a lot of weight. What will the many, many children eat? The German economy is withered and cannot fully supply the people with food, yet it wants to greatly increase the population. The result is only more active external aggression and large-scale war. War is Germany's way out, and it is also the way out for German children—to die—the innocent children who are "striving" to produce today are boxes of cannon fodder yet to be buried. Hitler wishes that women's reproductive cells could divide as quickly and as many as possible, and even more so that children could be blown up as quickly as rubber people. He wants to "manufacture" children like manufacturing armaments, in order to complete the "dream" of "My Struggle."

What crime have children committed? Before they are born, they are destined to die without a complete corpse. Hitler is the criminal of children and the great criminal of women. He sees women as "animals" who can work and reproduce, and prepares to slaughter their husbands and sons (in future wars). Those cross-shaped badges that reward childbirth are not a symbol of "glory," but, on the contrary, are a symbol of sinful shame. For freedom and for peace, we must tear up this sinful, shameful "new outfit."
