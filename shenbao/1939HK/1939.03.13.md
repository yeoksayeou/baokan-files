### Japan's Attack on the United Kingdom and the United States

Japan has recently been launching attacks on the United Kingdom and the United States using methods of monetary warfare.

Monetary warfare is the sharpest and most effective method of economic warfare. Therefore, for decades, the economic wars between the world's major powers have been concretely manifested in the struggle between currency blocs, such as the Sterling Bloc, the Franc Bloc, the Dollar Bloc, and even the Yen Bloc. This kind of monetary warfare has recently been reflected in the Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese invaders initially thought that military force could solve everything, but as the scale of the war expanded, especially when carrying out economic plundering, they discovered the resilience of China's legal tender (fapi) and recognized the power of the fapi in the War of Resistance. Subsequently, although the puppet United Reserve Bank was established and counterfeit banknotes were issued, they were still expelled by the fapi, and the people refused to use them. Japan originally wanted to weaken China's strength in the War of Resistance by destroying our fapi system and disrupting our financial organization, but it did not know that after nineteen months of our War of Resistance, the foundation of the fapi has become more consolidated. As Japanese economists generally say, if Japan cannot shake the foundation of China's fapi, it will be extremely difficult to force China to surrender.

The consolidation of the foundation of China's fapi is partly due to the abundance of hard currency reserves, but the important reason is the consistent and unwavering support of the United Kingdom and the United States. Japan's occupation of Guangzhou was for military purposes, but its intention to disrupt the economic ties between China and the United Kingdom in order to shake the foundation of China's fapi is very obvious. However, Guangzhou has been occupied for half a year, and the United Kingdom is still lending huge sums of money, directly and indirectly, to support our country's fapi. On the 7th, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon publicly announced that "the United Kingdom has decided to invest 10 million pounds to maintain the price of China's fapi as a basic fund for stabilizing currency prices" and established a new loan agreement. After this news came out, newspapers in Tokyo were greatly disturbed and criticized it heavily. The Hochi Shimbun even said: "The Japanese government should immediately lodge a strong protest against this unfriendly action by the United Kingdom, and at the same time, it should take active counter-measures against the new Sino-British agreement and retaliate against British interests in China." The Japanese cabinet also held an emergency meeting to discuss its attitude towards the United Kingdom.

On the other hand, a Reuters dispatch from Peiping reported: "The puppet government of North China has decided to ban the use of Chinese fapi from March 11, and will designate North China as a United Reserve Area... People in the area who dare to use Chinese fapi will be fined and their property confiscated." An Associated Press dispatch further reported: "The Japanese army has decided to implement foreign exchange controls in various parts of North China starting today." And promulgated new control regulations, forcing people to use banknotes from the "United Reserve Bank." This clearly shows that Japan has used force to incorporate various parts of North China into the so-called "Yen Currency Bloc," and the economic impact on the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will be very great. After the implementation of this policy by Japan, the United States will lose 60 million yuan in trade with China each year, and the losses suffered by the United Kingdom will be no less than this amount. This policy of Japan can be regarded as an economic retaliation taken by Japan against the United Kingdom and the United States. The implementation of this policy by Japan is not only a fatal blow to foreign businessmen in China, but also a great blow to British and American banks specializing in foreign exchange, especially HSBC.

Japan's monetary warfare attack is certainly directly attacking China, but in essence, the countries most harmed are the United Kingdom and the United States. Only by the United Kingdom and the United States retaliating against Japan as soon as possible and imposing economic sanctions can they stop the rampant behavior of the crazy aggressors. The economic sanctions imposed by the United Kingdom and the United States on Japan have not yet escaped the stage of empty talk, and at best are only indirect and partial measures. The United Kingdom has long been clamoring to revoke the rights enjoyed by Japan under the most-favored-nation clause, restrict the import of Japanese goods into the United Kingdom, or even completely ban them, but there is still no follow-up. Japan has now implemented an economic dogfight against the United Kingdom and the United States in North China. If its scope of implementation is expanded to the occupied areas of Central China and South China, the economic bases of the United Kingdom and the United States in China will be completely lost. If this conspiracy of Japan is tolerated by the United Kingdom and the United States, it can win without resorting to arms against the United Kingdom and the United States, and control the lifeline of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Pacific. At this time, the United Kingdom and the United States should have full consideration and active countermeasures. The Shanghai Da Mei Bao has analyzed the importance of the relationship in its commentary: "If all countries are willing to tolerate the exclusion by the aggressors or the puppet governments instructed by the aggressors, the trade of all countries in China will fall into a dead end. Under this kind of treatment that violates treaties and violates the principles of fairness, few foreign businessmen can survive." The newspaper also strongly urged all countries to impose effective sanctions on Japan in a timely manner: "Will Western countries tolerate the complete loss of their interests in China and only make protests that are of no help? Or will they take strong and effective steps to give their domestic merchants a chance to fight? Which way to go, now is the time!"

### Interview with General Li Zongren

— Special Correspondent Geng Ya

I have long admired the outstanding figure of this era – General Li Zongren, the commander of the Fifth War Area, who advocated a scorched-earth resistance even before the July 7th Incident, and who has been able to stand alone since the outbreak of the war.

Especially coming from the southwestern frontier of the War of Resistance – Western Province – where national defense construction has made rapid progress, the military and civilians are united as one, and waiting for an opportunity to kill the enemy. The so-called seeing its objects and thinking of its people, I was eager to see the demeanor of General Li, who is in a leading position in everything in Guangxi, and listen to his insightful opinions, so as to tell the readers everything. Naturally, this has become an important mission for me on this trip to a certain place.

I had seen several photos of General Li beforehand, and from his farsighted gaze and his awe-inspiring attitude, I suspected that he was not an easy person to approach and talk to. However, now, under the guidance of Shi Hualong, the director of the adjutant office of the Commander-in-Chief of the District, I was able to meet General Li in a medium-sized, leaky corner building in ××, and had a pleasant and frank conversation with him for more than an hour. He had a ruddy complexion, a kind and amiable attitude, but his speech was powerful and insightful, like that of a scholar. This increased my respect and admiration for him, and I privately congratulated him on the bright future of the War of Resistance in this area!

On that day, as soon as our happy and enjoyable conversation turned to the topic of the War of Resistance, the first chapter of the opening remarks, General Li said solemnly and righteously:

"We soldiers take obedience to orders as our duty!" The tone was abrupt, a bit like a peak flying from the sky, but the attitude was somewhat respectful, as if reading the will of the Prime Minister: "China has the wise and decisive leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the War of Resistance, and the military and civilians of the whole country can unite and protect Chairman Chiang's leadership in the War of Resistance to the end. We must clearly recognize that this is a major guarantee for China's inevitable final victory in the War of Resistance!" This statement has the flavor of Mr. Li Qiuquan's self-narration: "I looked down on Mr. Chiang before the War of Resistance, but after the War of Resistance, I kowtowed to Mr. Chiang." But now, the quick words coming from General Li, who has been leading hundreds of thousands of troops in the War of Resistance for twenty months, are naturally much more great and practical than the former.

"Conversely!" he said heavily again: "Since the war situation has entered a new stage, the Japanese army, deeply mired in the quagmire, encounters difficulties in every way it advances; behind it, guerrillas are actively operating; and bombs are buried everywhere in its own country; the international situation is becoming increasingly disharmonious with it – unless Japan immediately abandons its aggression; otherwise, failure will be inconceivable!" After talking about the general outline in such a way, he then analyzed each item in detail:

"Of course, the Japanese will fight like trapped beasts, and will still launch local offensives against us in the future, and will boast about so-called 'suppressing guerrillas,' and try to extend their reach beyond 'points' and 'lines,' which is objectively impossible. In every occupied area, there are hundreds and thousands of awakened young people who are willing to stay there to do political resistance work, and tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of regular troops and guerrillas who are cooperating there to do military resistance work. Our new forces are constantly growing and the momentum is increasing. The Japanese army cannot even protect the 'points' and 'lines' it has already occupied, so how can it have the extra strength to talk about 'suppression'? The Japanese army is not afraid of expanding the war zone and launching local offensives against us again, but it will still have no results and only increase its own difficulties.

"Japan is a small country in a state of raw material famine. It feels a lack of cotton, fur, food, and other industrial raw materials. In particular, oil and iron are no different from the blood and backbone of the god of war, but Japan mostly purchases them from abroad. Pre-war savings are limited. In the first phase of the War of Resistance, we crushed its strategy of 'quick victory,' and it was already stretched thin. In the current second phase of the War of Resistance, the situation is expanding day by day. The Japanese not only need more resources, but also need to increase their troop strength even more. The thirty-odd divisions currently in China are badly battered. Because conscription is a problem (conscription has exceeded fifteen terms, and even fifteen- and sixteen-year-old children are being drafted), finance is a problem, and even sleeves feel difficult to fill. Where can they find a large new army to increase their numbers? But in fact, they have no choice but to squeeze their own people, which will arouse the rise of anti-war sentiments and the expansion of anti-war actions.

"The international situation is unfavorable to Japan. This can be clearly seen from the fact that the United Kingdom and the United States are granting loans to China. When Wuhan was abandoned, Japan announced to the international community that it did not recognize the Republic of China government; but the United Kingdom and the United States insisted on granting large loans to China, meaning they were telling Japan: 'You don't recognize it, but we do, and we will use our strength to help China.' And in the past, Japan could buy goods from the United Kingdom and the United States on credit, but now it 'shouldn't even think about it.' Because Japan is now trying to play the trick of 'using Chinese resources to dominate the Far East and conquer the world,' it has just come out of the gate and has already made people's heads ache. For the sake of their own interests, the United Kingdom and the United States will not sell their military supplies to Japan even if it has cash. Its unfortunate brothers, Germany and Italy, are truly birds of a feather, and are similarly consuming themselves in aggression, and will not be able to take care of themselves in an emergency.

"The military strength of the Anglo-American-French-Soviet peace front is increasing day by day, while the military strength of the Japanese-German-Italian aggression front is decreasing day by day. When the day comes when we must fight head-on, the Japanese-German-Italian wolves in cahoots, who are endangering world peace, will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the defeat in the First World War.

"Japan is in a situation of being scorched inside and out, and riding a tiger that it cannot dismount. It has probably foreseen its future terrible fate, so there are constant cabinet crises within the country. Members of parliament dare to openly question the government, saying that 'Konoe has lost the hearts of the people,' that 'Hiranuma has no concrete policies to win the support of the whole country,' and even scolding that 'the Hiranuma cabinet is the most unpopular cabinet in history.' This shows that Hiranuma, who has only been in power for a short time, has run into walls everywhere and has not accomplished anything, and has already aroused great resentment. At the same time, the fact that Japanese members of parliament are so opposed to the government is also a sign that the Japanese military government is about to collapse. Will there be another reorganization? But no matter how many times it is reorganized, the internal contradictions will still not be resolved."

General Li talked eloquently to this point, then suddenly pondered for a moment; then seeing that the charcoal fire in the basin was about to go out, he went to hold the tongs and added charcoal, and the three gold stars on his yellow collar badge shone brightly in the firelight. This reminded me of the time when he gave a lecture at the Guangxi Military Academy on his struggle history, saying that he used to be a peasant family who half-farmed and half-studied, and he had done all the farming work, chopping firewood, cutting grass, and even cleaning the cattle pen. His great spirit of hard work and practical work, which is consistent in poverty and success, and which is constantly being promoted and carried forward, is truly enough to enlighten and exemplify revolutionary soldiers and young people of the era.

"Japan is not without ways to save itself," he said, returning to his seat and resuming his previous topic: "The one who tied the bell must untie it. Japan should repent, automatically withdraw its troops, and return Chinese territory. Then the deep-seated hatred of generations will be resolved in one stroke. This is not only fortunate for China, but also fortunate for Japan." These words, when heard by the Japanese fascist warlords, must be like playing the lute to a cow, so he continued to say:

"This is just our objective way of thinking for Japan, of course, Japan will absolutely not do this. The Japanese warlords want to act recklessly. The result of acting recklessly will either be the defeat of the war of aggression, or the Japanese people, who can no longer tolerate it, will unite and carry out a revolution to overthrow their warlords. But at this time, Japan will be in a state of collapse, and the suffering will be even greater. The peace-loving Japanese people, 'if they are hungry, they will seek food,' will have to ask us for help to re-establish the foundation of their social stability."

Regarding the period of the great defeat of the Japanese war of aggression, the general estimated: "The maximum is no more than two years." He further said: "If Japan's finances can support it to fight for another year and a half, it will be remarkable – as for our external assessment of the enemy and internal examination of the national situation, having determined a long-term War of Resistance, we can continue the war for five or ten years... This has practical potential strength and objective inevitable conditions."

Afterwards, from improving the weaknesses of the early War of Resistance, he talked about the issue of domestic political adjustment: He said: By using the raging flames ignited by the War of Resistance, the white-hot boiling blood, to sweep away all internal corruption and decay, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Talking about the Wang Jingwei issue, he said that Wang abandoned his status as a meritorious official of national revival and went to make peace with the enemy, resulting in his ruin and eternal damnation. Finally, he even talked about the Miao and Yao people in Guangxi, saying that the Miao and Yao people in Guangxi have modern firearms, which he advocated giving them in the past. At that time, some people opposed it, fearing that they would rebel if they got guns. In fact, not giving them guns and preventing them from rebelling is like 'attacking the city as the inferior strategy,' and giving them guns and making them truly united with us is the good strategy of 'attacking the heart as the superior strategy.' As expected, now they are being used to contribute to the entire country and nation! In short, every time he talks about an issue, he has his own unique insights, which flow from his gentle mouth, and cannot help but make you sincerely convinced.

The day after the enjoyable conversation and farewell, I also received a page of calligraphy from General Li for this newspaper through Mr. Wei Yongcheng, the director of the political department, encouraging the people to resist to the end (see illustration): and a victory memorial photo from Taierzhuang, showing the General still looking awe-inspiringly and vigilantly at the bright victory ahead!

### The Increasingly Serious Grain Problem in Guangdong Province

— Liang Yi

Recently, the grain panic in Guangdong has reached an exceptionally severe level: In the worst-affected areas, such as the Chao-Shan and Sze Yup regions, and areas near occupied zones, one yuan can only buy about four catties of white rice. Averaging across the province, rice prices are twice as expensive as they were at the same time last year. This poses a severe threat especially to the lower and middle classes: urban artisans and the poor, who in the past could earn enough to fill their bellies each day through labor, now must tighten their belts and eat less; poor farmers in rural areas, who in the past sold their hard-earned grain at low prices to repay debts when new grain was harvested, now must buy back rice piecemeal at prices several times higher to stave off hunger. Laboring compatriots throughout the province are teetering on the brink of starvation. We hear their cries of pain from every corner of the province (In recent days, people in Sze Yup, Zhongshan, and other places have sent telegrams to the administrative commissioner of the region, the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, and the national and provincial governments, appealing for help.) This is a serious problem for Guangdong in the second stage of the war of resistance. If this problem is not properly resolved, it will greatly hinder the stability of the front and rear, and mass war mobilization. Fortunately, our wise local officials in Guangdong have attached great importance to this problem and have determined a correct policy. A quick dispatch from Shaoguan, published in a Hong Kong newspaper on February 28th, stated: Zhang Fakui, commander of the Fourth War Zone, and Li Hanshun, chairman of Guangdong Province, now consider that the exhaustion of grain in Guangdong and the daily rise in rice prices must be urgently addressed to support the war of resistance and maintain the people's livelihood. To address both the symptoms and the root causes, in addition to actively communicating with Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi provinces to secure grain sources for immediate relief, they have also issued orders to the magistrates of various counties, strictly urging township heads in grain-producing areas to instruct villagers to reclaim wasteland and expand this year's spring plowing. The planting of non-grain-related crops will be restricted. The Provincial Bank also plans to allocate 10 million yuan to provide spring plowing loans, striving to increase grain production and fundamentally resolve the grain crisis in Guangdong. In addition to agreeing with and supporting this correct measure, we wish to deeply examine this problem and propose some concrete solutions to contribute to our wise local officials and all compatriots in the province:

The shortage of grain in Guangdong did not begin today, especially in Chao-Shan and Sze Yup. Every year during March and April, when stored grain is almost depleted and new grain has not yet come to market, rice prices rise sharply. Many men going to Nanyang to seek a living, weakening the agricultural productivity of the villages, is an objective reason. However, this is not an irremediable weakness. Countless tracts of land lie barren, uncultivated. In eastern Guangdong, fields of millet have replaced rice and wheat growing on fertile land. Grain production still follows centuries-old methods, with no change whatsoever. A vast labor force is not being utilized, and batches of villagers are flowing into the cities. Humanity, bound by unreasonable production, social, and political organizations, demonstrates its inability to conquer nature here. These unreasonable organizations not only directly constrain agricultural productivity but also cause various abnormal phenomena in the grain circulation process. Landlords in rural areas and unscrupulous merchants in cities buy grain from farmers at low prices when new grain comes to market, then hoard it and sell it at high prices when grain is scarce. Some places with abundant grain production are prohibited from exporting grain under the pretext of storing grain, forcing farmers to sell at painfully low prices, from which a few profit. These are the main reasons for the grain panic in Guangdong.

After the July 7th Incident, these weaknesses were not overcome. Although the central government's financial and economic policies have seen many new improvements since the war of resistance, these malpractices have remained unchanged in Guangdong. On the contrary, due to the invasion of Guangdong by Japanese troops, the occupation of Guangzhou and surrounding areas, the flight of people near the war zones, and the intensification of the economic offensive by Japanese people in the East River area, grain production in the Pearl River Delta and nearby areas has been completely ruined. Japanese people are buying large quantities of grain in Zhongshan and other coastal counties to supply their invading navy and transport it inland to manipulate rice prices. The destruction of roads and the occupation of the southern section of the Yuehan Railway have further increased the difficulty of transporting grain from Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi into Guangdong and the circulation of grain within Guangdong. The severance of Guangdong's international transport lines and the even more severe blockade in the future will also prevent the import of foreign rice into Guangdong. This has made the rice shortage in Guangdong even more severe. The unprecedented rise in rice prices in Guangdong Province at present is a concrete reflection of the development of these factors.

Therefore, we believe that to truly solve this problem, both "addressing the symptoms and the root causes" is absolutely necessary.

First, there should be appropriate regulation of grain distribution. Each county and township throughout the province should immediately conduct a survey of the types, quantities, and required levels of stored grain. The government or community-organized cooperatives should purchase surplus grain from each county and township at a fixed price, conduct price stabilization measures, and take unified allocation. Private hoarding of grain, manipulation of market prices, and the smuggling of grain to aid the enemy by traitors must be strictly prevented. In areas such as the West River region, according to what we know: Guangning, Yangchun, Enping, and Zhongshan all produce abundant rice. In addition to supplying the needs of their own counties, they can also export to relieve neighboring counties. Each county and township should not have local perspectives but should prioritize the nation and the country, and take care of the overall situation. In addition, the authorities should also try to use all possible means of transportation to transport large quantities of rice from Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi into Guangdong, and temporarily reduce taxes on foreign rice to supplement the shortage of domestic rice. In order to effectively implement the above work, each county should convene local fair merchants and representatives of community organizations to discuss specific implementation measures, and establish organizations such as grain relief committees to be responsible for carrying out this work. The heads of these implementing agencies must be honest and fair and fully implement the opinions of the people. It is hoped that the administrative commissioners of all regions of the province—especially the regions of Sze Yup and Chao-Shan—will also convene meetings of the administrative heads of each county to discuss unified relief measures.

At the same time, all localities should call for widespread grain conservation movements, such as not making rice cakes during the New Year festival, reducing wine steaming, raising fewer domestic fowl, and promoting the consumption of miscellaneous grains. Through the political mobilization of the masses, organized masses from existing community organizations should take a model role, and extend this movement to the masses of all levels.

Secondly, production must be greatly increased. Currently, the main task is to call for and launch a widespread spring plowing campaign. First, a large amount of existing wasteland must be reclaimed—especially in areas farther from the front lines. All available manpower must be mobilized, such as large numbers of refugees, the unemployed, and rural women. First, community organizations must mobilize their already organized masses and organize countless reclamation teams to unite the unorganized masses to carry out this work. Wasteland belonging to the public should be allocated to the masses for cultivation by the government. Wasteland belonging to landlords should be borrowed by the government for their use. Families of soldiers fighting the war of resistance should be helped by everyone with free cultivation. The government should designate damaged roads for landowners to divide into sections for plowing and application. Local defense forces and self-defense teams should also participate in this work as much as possible in their spare time. Second, the planting of unnecessary agricultural products and even harmful crops, such as poppies, should be reduced, and replaced with rice and wheat. In the current situation, the planting of miscellaneous grains that can be harvested in a shorter period should be increased to meet urgent needs. Third, seeds, production methods, and production tools should be improved to obtain greater harvests on the same cultivated land. It is hoped that the provincial government will convene agricultural experts and a large number of technicians to assist in this work. Local farmers' organizations should provide more opinions to the government, such as building water conservancy projects, purchasing new agricultural tools and seeds, and organizing production cooperatives. In order to ensure the progress of these tasks and to improve farmers' enthusiasm for production, the government must improve farmers' lives as much as possible and help them solve specific difficulties, such as appropriately reducing rent and interest, extending the land lease period for tenant farmers by landlords, providing farmers with seeds, farm tools, land, and fertilizers without requiring property or gentry guarantees, banning high-interest loans in rural areas, establishing rural financial circulation institutions by the government, providing loans to farmers with no or very low interest, establishing free schools and night schools, and providing free education to their poor children. Second, farmers must be organized on a broad scale, including organizations for production, organizations for consumption, organizations for self-defense, and organizations for cultural education. Only under a more rigorous organization can they be helped to produce more diligently and effectively. The best form of organization is organizations like mutual aid societies. Under these organizations, reclamation teams, field and forest protection teams, guard teams, literacy groups, salvation rooms, field affairs research groups, guerrilla groups, etc. can be established. These organizations can not only help mobilize farmers to work hard in production, but also immediately become organizations for mobilizing farmers to participate in guerrilla warfare and assist government regular troops in resisting Japanese troops when war comes.

We must fully recognize the seriousness of the current grain problem in Guangdong. Although our local government has vigilantly taken note of this problem and has a correct solution, and these solutions are beginning to be implemented, the solution to this problem will not achieve the desired results if it relies solely on the government without the cooperation of the people. All community organizations throughout the province should immediately mobilize, support the government's basic policy for solving the grain problem, help the government regulate grain, and organize countless reclamation teams, substitute farming teams, and production teams to go to the 'front line' of production, launch a full-scale spring plowing campaign throughout the province, and, in this movement, organize millions of Guangdong farmers into the ranks of the war of resistance, preparing to launch a province-wide guerrilla war in the near future, and strike at the enemy's continued advance into Guangdong!

### China's Way of Resisting Aggression and Seeking Peace Two Thousand Years Ago

— Zeng Qi

"The Chinese nation is known to the world for its love of peace and opposition to aggression, and it has earned the reputation of a peaceful nation for good reason." Historically, China has never invaded any small or weak nation. Ideologically, Chinese Confucianism, Taoism, Mohism, Legalism, and even militarism all take peace as their guide, and no one has ever praised war. Tracing back to the seventh century BC, during the decline of the Zhou Dynasty in the feudal era, various kingdoms were divided and fought against each other. The people's emotions of anti-war and praying for peace were extremely strong. Therefore, the following peace methods were developed:

(1) Guan Zhong's Peace Method: In 685 BC, Duke Huan of Qi obtained the great statesman Guan Zhong as his prime minister. Guan Zhong advocated maintaining armed peace with Qi as the center. All problems should be resolved by convening international conferences. He successively convened a total of nine conferences, all with Qi as the leader. He achieved hegemony without bloodshed. Confucius called Guan Zhong "uniting the feudal lords nine times and rectifying the world." This can be called the peace method of a hegemon.

(2) Mozi's Peace Method: The philosopher Mozi wrote "Against Aggression," becoming a famous anti-aggression advocate. Although Mozi fundamentally opposed war, he advocated studying self-defense methods. At that time, Gongshuban was advocating war and building cloud ladders for Chu to attack the city of Song. Mozi then went to Song to help defend it. As a result, Gongshuban attacked nine times without success, and Song was able to survive. This can be called the peace method of self-defense.

(3) Song Keng's Peace Method: In the 3rd century BC, Song Keng, who lived at the same time as Mencius, witnessed the disturbances of international warfare and endless conquests, and persuaded the feudal lords, strongly arguing for the injustice of war. He persuaded them to stop fighting and maintain peace. This can be called the peace method of persuasion.

(4) Xiang Xu's Peace Method: During the Spring and Autumn Period, Xiang Xu of Song, seeing that wars between countries caused disasters and suffering to the people, initiated a disarmament conference, calling for peace. Jin Gui said to Xuan Yuhe: "War is the destruction of the people, the burden on wealth, and a major disaster for small countries." They initiated together and jointly planned to implement it. Its nature is similar to today's international disarmament conference, and it can also be called "abolition of military armaments." This can be called the peace method of disarmament.

Of the above four, I believe Mozi's peace method is the most reasonable and effective. Mozi practiced what he preached, helping Song defend itself, and the aggressor Gongshuban could do nothing about it. Mozi's "Against Aggression" says: "When a great state attacks a small state, other states should help defend it; if the walls of the small state are not complete, they must be made to repair them; if the supply of grain is cut off, then provide it; if money and silk are not enough, then share them." His words on the indivisibility of peace are almost in line with US President Roosevelt's "Indivisible Peace Theory," reflecting each other from ancient and modern times, as if they were in agreement. Therefore, he advocated that when a strong country invades a weak country, countries that love peace must rise up together to intervene. At the same time, the weak country must strengthen its defenses. If food is insufficient, provide it with resources; if finances are insufficient, provide it with capital. If this can be done, the aggressor will know that his plan cannot succeed, and will naturally withdraw. This kind of self-defensive, inclusive, and helpful peace method is most beneficial to world peace. I hope that the comrades of the Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement Conference will dedicate this idea to peace-loving people all over the world, and work together to make aggressors disappear from the world, so that human civilization will advance indefinitely.

### Our Troops Fight Bravely in Guerrilla Areas: The Enemy Intensifies Attacks in Southern Su, Lu, and Ji, and Lands in Haicheng, Southern Fujian

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, [blank]th of the month by this Newspaper] The overall war situation is generally stable, but the enemy is still making every effort to attack our guerrilla forces in occupied areas. Fierce battles are taking place in many places in southern Jiangsu, Shandong, and Hebei. The enemy continues to reinforce troops in southern Hebei, attempting to launch another large-scale attack. We have increased our forces in various places and will inflict heavy blows on the enemy.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, [blank]th of the month by this Newspaper] A telegram from Jingmen states that the enemy on the Hanyi and Jingzhong Roads are the 16th Division, and those on the Hua-Xiang Road and in Tianmen and Yuekou are the 3rd Division. They are currently unable to launch attacks and have adopted a defensive posture. More than 300 enemy soldiers attempted to cross the river stealthily from Huangcheng Temple yesterday but were repelled by us. We and the enemy are engaged in fierce battles in Changshoudian West, Pumen Northeast, and other areas north of Zhongxiang. Our forces launched attacks on Majiaji, Liushuigou, and Zhangjiaji, achieving considerable gains. Zhangjiaji was once recovered. Fierce battles are currently taking place near Fengle River and Hejiaji. The enemy on the Hua-Xiang Road is attempting to attack Suixian and Zhaoyang, but we have taken strict precautions.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, [blank]th of the month by this Newspaper] A telegram from Xiangyang states that we are currently launching guerrilla warfare in various places in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, attacking the enemy. We have also damaged the railway in many places. The situation in eastern Henan is calm. The enemy has few troops in various places and has no intention of attacking recently.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, [blank]th of the month by this Newspaper] A telegram from Guilin states that there are no changes in the war situation in South China. Yesterday, the enemy shelled Meiaotou and the vicinity of Canghaiji from Xiamen. 300 to 400 enemy soldiers attempted to land near Haicheng on four boats but were repelled by us.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, [blank]th of the month by this Newspaper] A telegram from Xi'an states that the enemy invading Jingle numbers about 2,000. We have been reinforcing our forces and counterattacking for days. Fierce battles are taking place in Yonganzhen, Liulinzhen, and Ninghuazhen. In the battle of Dawuzhen in southern Shanxi, we lured the enemy to Yukouzhen and surrounded them on three sides, annihilating 600 to 700 enemy soldiers. A portion of the enemy attacked Shimen, but we intercepted them. Fierce battles are taking place between us and the enemy near Jiangxian and Yicheng in southern Shanxi, and in the vicinity of Dajiaozhen. The enemy has increased forces in Yucheng, attempting to invade west again, but we are waiting in strict formation.

[News from Xingji from the Kuomintang] After our troops made a large-scale rear guard action in western Shanxi, they have been continuously searching and advancing for days, completely eliminating the remnants of the enemy at Jiaokou Hejiata, killing hundreds of enemy soldiers. Near Lijiawan, our troops seized six bunkers, eliminating most of the enemy guarding them. Lijiawan has been heavily besieged, and the enemy is very panicked. Fierce battles are still taking place near Jinjie Town. It is also reported that Zhongyang Yunbo has increased the enemy forces by 3,000 to 4,000, with 30 artillery pieces and more than 10 tanks. With the exception of 2,000 who attacked Dawu to the north, the rest are stationed in various strongholds in the middle, attempting to invade west. However, after this defeat, their plan has been largely broken by our troops.

[News from Xingji from the Kuomintang] The conscripted soldiers trained by the enemy in Yangyu County have recently been greatly shaken in morale due to the shortage of food and the tight pressure from our troops. Fearing disturbances, the enemy has already disbanded hundreds of conscripts by imperial decree.

[News from Xingji from the Kuomintang] It is also reported that the enemy at Jindui, northeast of Anze, was severely attacked by our forces. Unable to hold out, the enemy fled through Anji, disturbing Tangcheng Town east of Mapaoquan. We are currently tracking them down. Another force is intercepting them west of Tangcheng, surrounding them from both sides. The enemy is currently very panicked.

[News from Xingji from the Kuomintang] Anti-war sentiment is very high among the soldiers in Fencheng. According to the enemy soldiers, when they were told to depart, the authorities told them that the conscription period was seven months, but now it has been a year and they cannot return. They believe this is because the families of soldiers in the country have made requests that the authorities cannot meet. Furthermore, two soldiers in Hongtong committed suicide due to war weariness the other day. Three others outside Zidonggu secretly changed into plain clothes and privately escaped on a train, but were caught. The lack of morale of the enemy army is evident from this.

### Our Three Regular Army Divisions Open the Beijing-Shanghai Line: Shangguan Yunxiang is Appointed Commander: Currently Actively Preparing for a Counterattack

[Shanghai Dispatch] The guerrilla forces of our army on the Beijing-Shanghai Line have been adjusted and are in order. Three elite regular army divisions have been transferred from a certain place earlier this month, and Shangguan Yunxiang is in charge. A large-scale general counterattack will soon occur. The enemy forces are extremely panicked and are setting up defensive works along the Beijing-Shanghai Line day and night. Details are recorded as follows:

Regular Army Transferred to the Beijing-Shanghai Line

Regarding the military plans for each guerrilla area, the authorities have made overall plans and established a Guerrilla Headquarters. Chairman Chiang is concurrently the Director-General and has designated various provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Shandong, to be divided into several districts. A branch office will be established in each district, with military and political officials. They have already been appointed, and each district is actively proceeding. It is learned that regarding the Beijing-Shanghai Line, three elite regular army divisions were transferred from the central government, totaling more than 40,000 men. They arrived at various locations on the Beijing-Shanghai Line earlier this month according to plan to make deployments. All original guerrilla forces scattered in various areas and engaged in attacking the enemy were reorganized by the regular army to serve as reserves, remaining in place to guard and not disturb civilian businesses. Pay and supplies are allocated by the central government.

Enemy Forces Panicked: Setting up Works

Since the expansion of the war zone, most of the enemy forces in the rear have been dispatched to the front line for combat. The number of enemy soldiers guarding the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line is only about one division, and among these enemy forces, there are many conscripts newly recruited from within the country, so their strength is very weak. In recent days, the enemy has been setting up works along the Beijing-Shanghai Line, day and night. Because anti-war sentiments have recently intensified among the enemy forces in various places, and the puppet troops that have been incorporated into their ranks also occasionally defect, the enemy military authorities are uneasy, in a state of extreme tension and panic.

The command of the guerrilla war on the Beijing-Shanghai Line has been entrusted to Shangguan Yunxiang by the central government. It is now learned that he has arrived at a certain location and, together with the Director of the Jiangsu District Guerrilla Branch Office, ×××, are inspecting the Beijing-Shanghai Line and making preparations for a counterattack. It is anticipated that in the shortest possible time, a large-scale guerrilla war will be launched on the Beijing-Shanghai Line. As for the puppet troops, police, security teams, etc., in various counties that have submitted to the enemy, the central government has given them official recognition so that they can coordinate during the general counterattack.

Cao Changjin's Troops Charge into Changshu

The guerrillas led by Captain Cao Changjin charged into the west gate of Changshu on the evening of the 6th, leading his troops from Tangshizhen, surrounding the Jiangzhe Fourth District Pacification Headquarters, and forcing them to surrender their weapons. The puppet commander Xu Feng fled in panic when he heard the alarm. The remaining troops abandoned their weapons and surrendered. In this battle, Cao's troops captured 260 rifles, 57 Mauser pistols, and 12 light and heavy machine guns without shedding a drop of blood, and recruited 280 puppet police officers. With bugles blaring, they organized themselves and withdrew from the city, still lurking in the countryside, waiting for an opportunity to strike.

Japanese Soldiers in Zhabei Add More Bunkers

Japanese soldiers in Shanghai, fearing attacks by our guerrillas, have increased their troops and set up defensive works in Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, Hongkou, and western Shanghai. They have also sealed up houses in Nanshi and Zhabei to prevent guerrillas from hiding. On the 7th, Japanese and puppet forces carried out sealing work on empty houses in Pudong and western Shanghai. At the same time, they built more bunkers in areas such as Baziqiao, Miaoxing, and Zhongshan Road Bridge, stationing troops to defend them. On the one hand, Japanese soldiers patrol in groups of three or five, the state of fear being unprecedented. According to villagers traveling to and from the guerrilla areas, recently a large detachment of Japanese troops suddenly went to Beixinjing, Hongqiao, Hejiajiao, and other places to garrison, and the inspection of incoming and outgoing people has become stricter. In addition to the increased sentries at various waterway crossings, defensive objects have also been added. Trenches have also been dug day and night in the Chenjiazai area west of the Da West Road Railway. Around 9 a.m. on the 6th, those coming to Shanghai from western Shanghai heard booming cannon fire and dense machine gun fire. Judging from the situation, it seems that the Japanese army was conducting live ammunition exercises. However, in view of the tense atmosphere of navigation in western Shanghai recently, it is feared that guerrillas would attack, so they were just putting on a show of force as a demonstration. (8th)

### Our Export Goods in January: Animal Products are the Most Numerous: Egg Exports Exceed Four Million: Germany Ranks First in Sales Areas

[News from This Port] According to a recent report from our import and export customs, animal and animal products were the most numerous of our country's export goods in January of this year, accounting for the first place in national merchandise exports. The total value was 12,819,047 yuan in national currency, more than double that of the same period in the 27th year, a total of 6,605,887 yuan, and 3,167,827 yuan more than the same period in the 26th year. The export goods in this category include beef, pork, poultry, pig bristles, eggs, poultry feathers, hair, sheep intestines, ham, deer antlers, musk, animal oil, etc., but leather goods and fish and marine products are not included. Among these export goods, eggs are the largest category, including dried eggs, dried egg whites, egg yolks, frozen wet eggs, egg whites, egg yolks, fresh eggs, preserved eggs, and salted eggs, worth a total of 4,224,397 yuan in national currency, an increase of 2,282,614 yuan over the same period last year. The second largest is pork, worth 3,298,797 yuan in national currency, an increase of 1,731,221 yuan over the same period last year. As for the sales areas for these animals, Germany ranks first with 3,864,836 yuan in national currency, an increase of more than 40% over the same period last year. Hong Kong ranks second with 2,572,180 yuan, also showing a slight increase over last year. The United States accounts for 2,253,104 yuan. The United Kingdom, which ranked second in sales last year, fell to fourth place this year, with a total value of 2,006,388 yuan, but also an increase of one-half compared to the same period last year. Looking at the above figures, the general situation of our country's foreign trade can be seen, and it has not been affected by the war in any way, which is quite encouraging.

### Heroic Deeds of Youth and Students in Southern Hebei: Attacking Hengshui's Sichen School, Fierce Fighting for a Long Time, Inflicting Heavy Casualties on the Enemy

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] According to military intelligence, during this enemy invasion of Southern Hebei, the faculty and students of our Sichen School engaged in a desperate battle with the enemy, their deeds moving both gods and mortals, and striking fear into the enemy's hearts. On the 15th of last month, at 2 PM, approximately two to three hundred enemy troops, composed of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, attacked the Zhao Jiaquan, Da Tianquan, and Li Jia areas of Hengshui, where our Sichen School was located. The faculty and students of the school immediately engaged the enemy with rifles. When the enemy infiltrated the village, the faculty and students threw grenades from the rooftops, killing fifty to sixty enemy soldiers and destroying three vehicles. The enemy, unable to withstand the attack, retreated in disarray out of the village. The faculty and students then pursued them from the rooftops, resulting in fierce street fighting. Although the enemy relied on superior weaponry to launch a fierce offensive, they were ultimately repelled by the students' generous and courageous spirit. Subsequently, enemy reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce artillery barrage against our encirclement, leading to three to four hours of intense fighting. When our ammunition ran out, we launched a counter-offensive. Most of the students were underage youth, and some of the younger ones were unable to keep up with the charge. The faculty and students who had already broken through made repeated charges back and forth, finally breaking through the encirclement completely at 12:30 AM. Due to their youthful vigor, the faculty and students often disarmed the enemy with their bare hands. However, due to the vast disparity in numbers and the poor quality of our equipment, casualties were quite high. It is estimated that over a hundred enemy soldiers were killed and five enemy vehicles were destroyed in the battle. It is said that the government has provided preferential treatment and compensation to the teachers and students of the school.

### Sino-Soviet Air Route: Chongqing-Alma Ata Route Being Planned; Expected to Open This Summer

[Shaoguan Express News] Yesterday, according to official sources, since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union after the War of Resistance, the Soviet military and civilians have shown consistent sympathy for China's war of resistance, providing us with tremendous spiritual assistance. Since President Sun's visit to the Soviet Union for observation, the diplomatic relations between the two countries have become increasingly close. Therefore, since September of last year, the Chinese and Soviet governments have begun to negotiate the establishment of a new direct passenger and postal air route. The negotiations have been very successful. Recently, they planned to open a new route from Chongqing to Alma Ata. This route is divided into two sections: the first section from Chongqing to Hami in Xinjiang, and the second section from Hami to Alma Ata. This matter is under active negotiation by both parties, and there is a great possibility of it being realized. It is expected to be realized in early summer this year. (New Voice Society)

### Japanese Armed Police Sneak into Shanghai International Settlement, Hide in Residence of Puppet Government Official in U.S. Defense Zone, Expelled by U.S. Marines After Exposure

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 12th] Yesterday, an informant from the Public Works Department searched a residence of a high-ranking puppet government official within the U.S. Marine Corps defense zone and discovered four Japanese armed police officers inside. He immediately notified the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters by telephone. The U.S. Marines then dispatched two officers leading twenty Marines by vehicle to the residence and expelled the Japanese police. According to eyewitnesses, the Japanese police officers obeyed the order to leave the residence and dared not resist. It has been learned that the mission of the Japanese police officers was to investigate the residence due to infighting among the puppet government officials.

### National Spiritual Mobilization (2): Full Text of the Outline

Saving the Nation Through Morality

Today's need for China is to revive the declining, eliminate the invading enemy, and save the country. Therefore, what is needed from all of our citizens today is a unified morality that strives for practical action, which is the morality of saving the nation. This morality of saving the nation is inherent in our ancestors and is also the eight virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The level of understanding of these eight virtues may vary among citizens, but the past continuation and glory of the Chinese nation depended on this morality, and today's decline and weakness are due to the loss of this morality. Therefore, it is imperative to require our citizens to uniformly establish this morality of saving the nation. Among the eight virtues, the most fundamental are loyalty and filial piety. Loyalty and filial piety are the great foundation of the Chinese nation, and the most precious treasures left by our ancestors to future generations over five thousand years. Now, at a time of national crisis, all compatriots must be loyal and filial to the utmost, dedicating their loyalty to the nation and their filial piety to the people. Let us first speak of filial piety. For thousands of years, the so-called filial piety in Chinese society has not only meant being filial to one's parents but also emphasizing filial piety to one's ancestors. Therefore, having no descendants to perform ancestral rites was considered the greatest sin. This applies to the direct ancestors of every individual. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of nationalism, he further elaborated and promoted the inherent Chinese filial piety to the nation, extending it from the love of one's relatives to the mutual protection of those of the same country and race, and from the pursuit of distant ancestors to the understanding of the interconnectedness of those of the same country and race. Therefore, the object of our filial piety today should be the entire nation, and we should strive not to disgrace our common ancestors. We should always remember that the beautiful rivers and mountains that our ancestors worked so hard to build and leave to us will be lost at our hands. Then, how can we face our ancestors above and our common descendants below? Other sins can be forgiven, but the absence of filial piety cannot be redeemed. If our compatriots understand this meaning, then sacrificing oneself to maintain the survival of the nation will surely be regarded as everyone's highest responsibility. Secondly, the so-called loyalty must first be loyalty to the nation. Loyalty to the nation is, in fact, the preservation of the survival and development of our people. In China today, everyone must regard protecting national independence as a sacred responsibility, and only then can the nation be saved. The nation has its absoluteness. To defend the freedom and independence of the nation, the primary condition is the absolute unification of military and political orders. Now that the violent enemy is destroying our nation with overwhelming force and creating puppet organizations in various occupied areas, attempting to divide our nation, all of our citizens must be united in loyalty to the nation to strengthen the nation's self-defense capabilities. Be loyal to your duties, loyal to discipline, loyal to laws and regulations, and never harbor any disunity or violate laws and regulations to weaken the nation's authority. If our people can truly be filial to the nation and loyal to the country, then the mission of resisting the enemy and saving the nation will have a reliable people to shoulder it. As for the virtues of benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace, they all evolve from the two virtues of loyalty and filial piety. Benevolence and love are the extension of filial piety, trustworthiness and righteousness are the extension of loyalty, and pacifism stems from the same source. Benevolence and love will prevent mutual slaughter, and peace is due to trustworthiness and righteousness. If we can promote the heart of benevolence and love today, then we will not sit idly by as our compatriots are humiliated and harmed, and we will surely have the courage to share a common hatred of the enemy. By promoting the heart of trustworthiness and righteousness, we will be able to be responsible and dedicated, honest and not deceptive, to create a united effort to face difficulties together. By promoting our thousands of years of inherent ideals of peace, we will gladly strive to resist violence and seek lasting peace, and we must take the lead in courageous and unyielding struggles. All of these virtues of saving the nation, when they exert their power, are no different from strong armor and sharp weapons. In essence, this is the spiritual weapon of the nation, and every citizen should arm themselves with it to drive out the violent enemy and create a glorious new history for our country.

Belief in Nation-Building

What is the ultimate purpose for which we today ask our people to converge on the same direction, establish the same morality, and strive hard? The ultimate purpose is to complete the construction of a nation based on the Three Principles of the People. As mentioned earlier, the significance of this war of resistance lies not only in repelling the enemy but also in establishing the foundation for nation-building. Therefore, even in wartime, we must never forget nation-building. Only by having a consistent and established nation-building policy and promoting it with all our strength can we fully exert the power to resist the enemy and seek victory. Only when all citizens can establish a belief in nation-building can the spiritual strength of the nation and the morality of saving the nation have a reliable place to be entrusted for positive development. Therefore, saving the nation and building the nation are inherently consistent and the same thing. The highest principle of China's nation-building is the Three Principles of the People, which were personally created by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. This is a common recognition among all compatriots in the country. Today, the existence or demise of the nation is at stake. If we win the war of resistance, then nation-building will surely be achieved, and the nation will enjoy permanent happiness and benefit. Therefore, our people must further consolidate their belief in the Three Principles of the People, our principles of nation-building, and strive together to achieve their realization. The goals of the Three Principles of the People are to promote equality in China's international status, equality in political status, and equality in economic status. The country we want to build in our ideals is independent, free, and equal externally, and a country owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people internally. This is the common aspiration of everyone, and the Three Principles of the People are the only method to achieve this nation-building. Now, in wartime, the people are invigorated, and the trends are more unified. Saving the nation and building the nation should be advanced simultaneously. In terms of nationalism, resisting foreign aggression to achieve national independence, freedom, and equality is the sole purpose of today's war of resistance. The domestic ethnic groups working together in the cause of resisting the enemy can further enhance the unity of the entire nation and lay a solid foundation for the broad Chinese nation. In terms of democracy, the popularization of the people's political consciousness during wartime is sufficient to accelerate the cultivation of genuine democracy. The concentration and adjustment of government powers during wartime are sufficient to create a highly efficient politics. In terms of the people's livelihood, the efforts to increase production and control consumption during wartime are to establish the foundation for equitable distribution of the people's livelihood.

### Former Governor-General of Vietnam Points Out: Japan's Enemy No. 1 is England, No. 2 is America. Enthusiastic Situation at the London Aid China Association

[Reuters, London, 12th] Yesterday, the China Congress held a meeting here, chaired by Dr. Wang Jingqi. Dr. Xia said at the meeting, "Resistance and recovery are China's current slogans." Professor Bourbon said, "Japan implemented a planned destruction of major Chinese universities and libraries at the beginning of the war. Within fourteen months of the start of the war, the losses of Chinese educational institutions reached 21.7 million yuan. Currently, the need for books is extremely urgent. Oxford University plans to donate various types of books worth between 5,000 and 10,000 pounds to China in the next few years. There are now British suggestions to provide financial assistance to China's industries and encourage China's exports to Britain." Former Governor-General of Vietnam, Varenne, said, "As far as Japan is concerned, the number one enemy is not China, nor the Soviet Union, but England. The number two enemy is the United States." Mr. Rothstein said, "The Soviet Union does not hide that it continues to transport military materials to China and morally assist China."

### Southern Shanxi in Struggle: Politics, Economy, Culture, Civil Movement (Part 1)

— Special Correspondent for Our Newspaper: Shanxi War Zone Report

Shanxi was once an old province, but it is now a young and vibrant province. In northeastern Shanxi, the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region was established; in southeastern Shanxi, it is a vast area controlled by the Eighth Route Army; in western Shanxi, our iron cavalry defends the Yellow River; and in southern Shanxi, we have equally valiant soldiers. The enemy only comes out to fight occasionally, and on the days they don't, it is our heroic soldiers' world. Shanxi is constantly at war!

Take southern Shanxi, where I currently live, for example! It is very different from the past. In the past, the people sighed and asked with despairing voices, "What do they want us to do?" "What can we do?" But now, they have stood up strongly. The young and strong have joined the self-defense forces, and women and old men are doing farm work as if nothing is happening under the rumbling of artillery fire. The children have joined the village-run national affairs and sing loudly after class: "Move forward, don't retreat, life and death have reached the final moment..." Because of the sacred War of Resistance against Japan, the old China has become young, the solidified places have become turbulent, and the farmers who were content with their lot in the past are now fighting.

Readers, please open your maps: You will see the counties of Yongji, Ruicheng, Yunxiang, Jiexian, Xiaxian, Anyi, Pinglu, Yuanqu, and Jiucheng along the northern bank of the Yellow River, which is what I am referring to as southern Shanxi. It can be said that the enemy exerts very little effort in these counties. Except for occupying a larger area in Yongji and Yunxiang, the enemy only occupies the railway line in Anyi and only Zhangdian Town in Pinglu. Jiucheng, Yuanqu, and Jiucheng are mostly in our hands. We rely on the towering Zhongtiao Mountains to consolidate our northern bank of the Yellow River. At the same time, this continuous Zhongtiao Mountain is our base for attacking the enemy and the location of our elusive guerrillas.

Apart from the military aspects of southern Shanxi, which we cannot conveniently report on, I must provide a general description of other aspects such as administration and civil movement:

Regarding administration, the candidates responsible for county administration are all county magistrates sent by the Shanxi Provincial Government. The county administration structure is much simpler than before. Shanxi does not have Baojia (a system of household registration and control), and below the county is the district office, and below the office is the village compilation. The village compilation takes one village as the main village and several villages as auxiliary villages. The village office is located in the main village, and there is also a Lu in the village, which is the smallest unit of village administration. The Lu has a Lu chief, and the village has a village chief and a village deputy, all of whom are elected by the people.

Among the county's administration, the most noteworthy are the economy and education. Although the economic situation here is under the active sabotage of the Japanese enemy, it has not had much impact. Because the method of reasonable burden has been implemented long ago, income and expenditure can still be barely balanced. As for Yongji, Yunxiang, Anyi, and other counties with more areas occupied by the enemy, their income is relatively lower. As for the daily life of the people, it has obviously improved due to the stationing of large troops. In Maojin, Pinglu, the price of grain once rose to one yuan for only one or two Jin of flour (usually one yuan could buy more than ten Jin), and the price of daily necessities was also very high. White sugar was one Hao per two, and it cost one yuan and six Jiao to buy one Jin.

There is still a great lack of spiritual food here. There are no lead-printed newspapers in this area. However, because of the convenient transportation, it is possible to see the newspapers from Xi'an and Luoyang every two or three days. In addition, there is also a "Qiao Han Daily" in Shaanxi County, which can be seen on the same day in Pinglu. Besides these, there are only mimeographed small newspapers. The mimeographed small newspapers include "Strike" (published by the Pinglu Strike Society), "National Salvation Weekly" (published by the Youth Salvation General Mobilization Committee), and "War of Resistance" (published by the 38th Army War Service Corps, now discontinued), which are all small sheets with half news and half text. Bound into volumes are "Lulin" (organ of the Sacrifice and Salvation Association); "Zhongtiao Voice" (published by the Sacrifice and Salvation Central District); "Battlefield" (published by the 38th Army War Service Corps); "Comrade-in-Arms" (published by the 31st Army Corps Comrade-in-Arms Society); "New Soldiers" (published by the headquarters of the 38th Army): "Half-Monthly Frontline" (published by the Political Department of the 17th Division), which are all semi-monthly publications, most of which are for their own people, but they are also suitable for general public reading. In addition to these, there are also wall newspapers published by the political departments of various armies.

Regarding education, every township has established a People's Revolutionary Primary School, and the teachers of the People's Primary School are mostly members of the Sacrifice and National Salvation League. The curriculum has also been changed to a curriculum against the enemy. The "Inked Grid" for primary school students to practice writing has also been changed from "Shang Da Ren Kong Yi Ji" to "We unite to drive away the Japanese enemy." As for the daily life of the students, in addition to attending classes, they also have military training and singing. An eleven- or twelve-year-old child has learned military common sense and the technique of throwing grenades. And songs like "Sacrifice has reached the final moment"; "Military-civilian cooperation"; "Defend the Yellow River" are sung while sitting and walking non-stop. (To be continued)

### British Acknowledge Czech Political Turmoil Will Not Affect Materials Bureau; Germany Still Closely Watching, Denies German Troops Crossed Czech Border

[Reuters, London, 12th] According to various visitors arriving here from Central Europe, they all expressed hope that Šídlo would form a new government to resolve the Slovakian political change, but acknowledged that Germany's attitude has not yet been decided, so the future development of the situation is still uncertain. The diplomatic correspondent of "The Observer" stated, "The official British opinion believes that the situation in Europe will not be affected by the sudden political change in Slovakia. According to various documents and intelligence received in London, it does not indicate that the coup in Slovakia was instigated by Germany. However, Slovakia's actions seem to have annoyed Hitler and Ribbentrop, because its request for assistance from Berlin is equivalent to proposing further action in Germany's Central European policy, which Ribbentrop is currently unwilling to propose. Therefore, on the one hand, the Vienna Radio Station was ordered to support the Slovak people, and on the other hand, Germany is trying to calm the high tension."

[Reuters, Vienna, 12th] A high-ranking member of the National Socialist Party secretly departed for Bratislava last night, but his mission has not been disclosed. Furthermore, Vienna Radio Station broadcasts a speech every half hour in Slovak, urging the Slovak people to continue attacking the Czech government and condemning the Czech government for causing the current crisis. Tonight's broadcaster claimed that Czech troops are concentrated on the German-Czech border.

[Reuters, Berlin, 12th] A declaration here, with apparent authorization, stated, "The Czech capital's opposition to Slovakia's actions, which infringed upon Slovakia's autonomous rights, has made the international situation revert to darkness." The declaration mentioned Chamberlain and Halifax discussing the possibility of a disarmament agreement, stating, "This is not an unwelcome sign. Britain has now acknowledged that the Western countries did not accommodate some of Germany's proposals regarding disarmament, resulting in the loss of a good opportunity for countries to agree on disarmament. Germany believes that disarmament by the Western countries is indeed essential."

[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] People in Berlin believe that the Czech situation is extremely serious. Political figures pointed out that the Vienna Arbitration Agreement (i.e., the agreement established after the Munich Agreement when demarcating the border between Czech and Slovakia) placed significant responsibility on Germany and Italy for maintaining law and order within Czech. People here emphasized that the principles of self-determination and autonomy stipulated in the Munich Agreement and the Vienna Arbitration Agreement have not been implemented. It has been evident since shortly after the Vienna Arbitration that the Czech government is unable to carry out reconstruction plans, and the situation between Czech and Slovakia has fallen into tension, ultimately leading to the current Slovak incident. The general impression here is that the centralist tendency of the Czech authorities arose from a desire to use time to change the existing situation. Furthermore, after Czech was divided, it is difficult for the remaining Bohemia and Moravia to maintain themselves. In addition, drawing a border between Czech and Slovakia that is ethnically and politically justifiable is, if not impossible, extremely difficult. What is more, Germany, as one of the arbitrators of the Vienna Arbitration, must seriously examine the situation in Czech and Slovakia and take responsibility for it. People here believe that maintaining law and order in Czechoslovakia is beneficial to European peace.

[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] No diplomatic activities related to the Slovak situation have been announced here. Berlin officials have so far only maintained close attention to the matter and indicated that Germany, as one of the guarantors of the Vienna Arbitration, is somewhat involved in the matter. Evening newspapers prominently published news from Bratislava, expressing sympathy for the Slovak people.

[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] Reports circulating outside that German troops have crossed the Czech border or intend to enter Czech territory have been denied by the German side.

### Slovakia Forms New Cabinet; Czech Troops Open Bratislava; Ďurčanský Attacks Czech Government

[Reuters, Prague, 11th] The new Slovak cabinet has been formed, with Czech Deputy Prime Minister Šídlo serving as Prime Minister of the Cabinet.

[Reuters, Prague, 11th] Slovak Acting Prime Minister Sidor yesterday notified the Czech capital government that he was unwilling to serve as Prime Minister. He is currently in Rome attending the Pope's coronation. Speaker of Parliament Sokol arrived here by plane today. He stated that he believes the current crisis will soon be overcome and is expected to be resolved tonight. Afterward, he visited Dr. Hodža. Officials denied that Germany had made any demands. It is generally believed that the current crisis may promote the reorganization of the Czech central government.

[Haitong News Agency, Bratislava, 11th] Today, ten military vehicles, fully loaded with Czech troops, arrived in Slovakia to reinforce the city, making the tense situation between the Slovak people and Czech troops even more serious. The Slovak people shouted loudly at the reinforcing Czech troops, "Shoot! We also have guns and cannons!" A large crowd surrounded the Czech barracks, shouting and demonstrating. Whenever Czech troops approached, they were forced to turn away. The Czech increase in administrative power in Slovakia has provoked resentment. Slovak Minister Dr. Šídlo broadcast to the public on the radio, saying that Czech troops would withdraw today. The Hlinka Guard team claimed that the Czech capital had forced Šídlo to compromise and mediate. Anti-Czech demonstrations will begin today throughout Slovakia. News came this morning that Czech police and Slovak students and Hlinka Guards had a serious clash. Czech police stabbed students with bayonets. Martial law has been declared in Saint Martin. Czech troops have occupied the Bratislava radio station and closed off the streets near the station, prohibiting traffic. This action is completely contrary to what Dr. Šídlo announced. According to reports from the Slovak front line, Czech troops are now mostly concentrated near Großgarting.

[Reuters, Prague, 12th] The conflict in Slovakia resulted in three deaths, two of whom were members of the Hlinka Guard and one of whom was a German woman. The capital of Slovakia was extremely orderly yesterday. Currently, Czech troops are patrolling the streets. Arrested members of the Hlinka Guard and other Slovak officials are loaded into vehicles and driven through the streets.

[Reuters, Vienna, 11th] Dr. Ďurčanský continued to attack the Czech capital government on the radio today. Ďurčanský stated that the Czech capital's dismissal of the Tiso cabinet was an illegal action, because to dismiss the Slovak cabinet, only the Slovak parliament could submit a vote of no confidence to be effective. Therefore, the Tiso cabinet should continue to perform its duties. Ďurčanský also heavily criticized the Czech side's arrest of Hlinka Guard leader General Ďurica and Slovak Propaganda Minister Mach.

### MacDonald and Jewish Representatives Hold Informal Meeting; No Progress Made

[Reuters, London, 11th] Colonial Secretary MacDonald held an informal meeting with a delegation of Jewish representatives this afternoon, discussing in detail the letter submitted by the Jewish representatives to the British government yesterday morning. It is reported that all points in the letter were closely analyzed. No British proposal was mentioned, and no progress seems to have been made.

### American Aircraft Still Being Shipped to Japan; Mostly Commercial Planes Announced

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] According to the government's arms control department, various countries have obtained export permits. The value of aircraft purchased is 5,594,428 gold yuan for France, of which military aircraft accounted for over 5 million yuan, 11,711,030 yuan for the United Kingdom, of which military aircraft accounted for 11,115,600 yuan, and only 223,224 yuan for China, of which 188,563 yuan has been paid for. The U.S. government has not issued permits to Japan, but in fact, aircraft worth 139,490 yuan were shipped to Japan, but most of them were commercial aircraft and those that had previously obtained permits.

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] Longshoremen in Portland and Astoria, on the U.S. West Coast, strongly refused to load scrap iron onto five Japanese transport ships. The Japanese ambassador consulted with State Department officials on "steps to be taken" to allow the Japanese ships to sail as usual, but did not lodge a protest. The State Department remained silent and had no comment.

### Sinclair Speech Maintains International Law and Order; National Consensus Agreed; British MP Advocates Economic Sanctions Against Japan

[Reuters, London, 11th] At the London China Conference today, the issue of the war in China from the perspective of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union was discussed. British Liberal Party leader in the House of Commons, Sinclair, also participated in the meeting, saying that dictatorial countries have two major points in common, namely, jointly suppressing China on the one hand, and supporting another dictatorial country, Japan, on the other hand. However, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Western democratic countries also have one point in common, which is to establish the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and maintain international law and order, while also being willing to witness China's growing prosperity and progress. Labor Party MP in the British House of Commons, Noel-Baker, said that he hoped the British government could cooperate with the United States and France to impose economic sanctions on Japan, prohibiting all Japanese goods from being imported. This move would not only help China but also bring an end to the endless ashes of Japanese soldiers from China to Japan.

### U.S. Navy Secretary Advocates Establishing Atlantic Base; Building Ships for Latin American Countries; State Department Gives Enthusiastic Endorsement

[Reuters, Charleston, 12th] U.S. Navy Secretary Swanson, before departing for the West Indies to recuperate from his chronic illness, made a statement saying that the recent U.S. Navy exercises in the Caribbean Sea proved that the opinions of naval experts were very correct. The United States really needs to establish bases for submarines, destroyers, and aircraft in the Atlantic.

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, at a press conference this evening, stated, "The State Department enthusiastically endorses the construction of warships for the governments of Latin American countries by U.S. naval shipyards. Necessary legislation is currently under consideration so that naval shipyards can carry out this task, but the defense of the United States is the most important thing. Work for foreign countries must not affect the expansion of the U.S. Navy."

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] According to a statement by U.S. Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Pittman, he will submit a bill to Congress next week to allow South American countries to build warships in U.S. naval shipyards and consider building them at the lowest possible price in order to compete with European dictatorial countries and reduce their threat to South America. The diplomatic aspect is paying close attention to this move because the agreement between the United States and Brazil was just announced three days ago.

### Pope's Coronation, Yesterday's Atrocity at St. Peter's Basilica; Representatives from Various Countries Attended

[Reuters, Vatican, 11th] Pius XII will hold a solemn and grand coronation ceremony tomorrow, as usual, to assume the position of Supreme Pontiff of the Catholic Church. All ceremonies will be held on the platform of St. Peter's Basilica, so that hundreds of thousands of people in the square can witness everything. This method is unprecedented since the coronation of Pius IX in 1846. The coronation ceremony will take about five hours. First, the Pope will be seated on a portable throne and sent into St. Peter's Basilica. Various countries will appoint diplomatic envoys to participate in the grand ceremony. The United Kingdom will send the Duke of Norfolk as a special envoy to represent the British King. U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Kennedy will represent President Roosevelt, and Chinese Ambassador Wellington Koo will participate. Other important representatives include Ireland's de Valera, Italian Crown Prince Umberto, and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. The tiara to be used tomorrow contains three gold bars inlaid on silver bars, with a white velvet base. The entire tiara is inlaid with hundreds of precious jewels, but it is still very light and can be worn for a long time without feeling uncomfortable.

### Italian Newspaper Cries Out for Colonial Territories by Force; Italian Ambassador Prevents British Foreign Office

[Reuters, Rome, 12th] The "International Relations" newspaper published an article last night regarding Italian colonial demands, stating, "The time for redrawing the world colonial map has now arrived. If Germany and Italy cannot obtain a just peace, they will use force to obtain justice. The Berlin-Rome axis is determined to seek survival. No amount of military expansion can stop this right to survival. What Italy seeks now is justice, and it will surely be victorious."

[Reuters, London, 12th] The Italian Embassy here issued a notice today stating that the Italian Ambassador yesterday

### Stalin Delivers Speech; Condemns Acts of Aggression; Sternly Criticizes Policy of Concession; Strengthens Combat Power of Red Army

[Reuters, Moscow, 11th] In a speech at the Soviet Communist Party Congress, Stalin sternly criticized Chamberlain's foolish policy of concession. According to the full text of Stalin's speech published by official forces, the acts of aggression by Germany, Italy, and Japan were detailed one by one. "Today's wars are purely launched by aggressor countries against Britain, the United States, and France, but the latter retreat and retreat again, making concessions and concessions again, so that the aggressor countries can openly redistribute the world's spheres of influence, causing non-aggressor countries to suffer sacrifices. Democratic countries not only turn a blind eye but also openly acquiesce. This kind of thing is hard to believe, but it is indeed a fact. For example, the policy of non-interference is tantamount to acquiescing to acts of aggression. Pacifism and disarmament plans are all dead and buried. Some say that the Munich Agreement is another way of building a policy of concession. Such seemingly right but actually wrong and eloquent words have become incredible, even the signatory countries of the Munich Agreement feel the same way. The Soviet Union cannot ignore this ominous event and should strengthen the combat power of the Red Army and Navy in the future in case of emergency."

[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 11th] Stalin said in a speech at the Soviet Communist Party Congress, "Foreign conspirators use the Soviet Union as a pawn of capitalist countries, not aggressor countries! Britain and France! Have abandoned the policy of collective security and moved towards a policy of non-interference and neutrality. I would like to warn the Western democratic countries that once this policy of non-interference is adopted, dangers and difficulties will inevitably arise." Stalin continued to mention the Ukrainian issue, saying, "Some parties have been constantly spreading rumors that Germany intends to take Ukraine, and their purpose is obviously to create a conflict between the Soviet Union and Germany. What is their intention? It is clear to all."

[Reuters, Tbilisi, 11th] Today, the subcommittees of the Soviet Communist Party Congress resolved two resolutions, expressing their disagreement with the British foreign policy of "constantly promoting fascist efforts." This resolution will be submitted to the full body for review tonight.

### Japan Attempts to Subtly Destroy Commercial Interests of Various Countries in China; American Business Community Reports to Government

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] According to reports from the business community here to the government, Japanese industries will soon launch a trade "counterattack" in the Far East, attempting to subtly destroy all commercial interests of various countries in China. The plan of this "counterattack," according to non-official statements, is quite fierce and may break out immediately. It is reported that the Japan Industrial Association has decided to use various means in all Japanese-occupied areas to control foreign businesses, forcing foreign businesses that handle import and export goods to go through Japanese brokers if they want to operate, otherwise, they will have no business to do. This is used to force foreign businesses to abandon their various rights and interests. Although this plan is not related to the regulations promulgated by Japanese officials restricting imports and exports in occupied areas, it is, in fact, intensifying the implementation of those regulations and exerting double pressure on foreign businesses to eliminate the existence of foreign commercial interests in China. Visiting the British Foreign Office was purely a routine visit, and there was no connection with the general political situation.

### National Defense Forces and Communist Party Engage in Fierce Fighting

[Reuters, Burgos, 12th] It is reported that the Communist Party's forces are now pushing forward into the Rullamenco district, which is the best residential area of Madrid. The National Defense Forces are still occupying the United Radio Station building, and fierce fighting is taking place nearby. It is reported that the militias of Murcia, Alicante, and Casarrubios have been driven back by the Communist Party's forces.

[Reuters, Madrid, 11th] The Communist Party here, because the headquarters of its Central Committee and local committees have been shelled, surrendered unconditionally to General Casado's forces this afternoon. Prior to this, the Communist Party sent several tanks, but they failed to reach their headquarters. After an hour of fierce fighting, several Communist Party members looked out from the windows of a building and saw Franco's troops in front of them, so they threw down their guns. However, this does not mean that the "war within a war" has come to an end, because severe measures are still being taken against the Communists occupying other buildings.

### German Aircraft Crashes; Four Officers and One Civilian Die

[Reuters, Milan, 12th] A German aircraft, flying from Tripoli to Stettin, crashed in Duca, near Ferrara. Two German officers in the aircraft parachuted out and escaped. Four other officers and one civilian were killed.

Brief Commentary

### Yu Bin Denounces Anti-Communism

[Washington Air Mail] Bishop Yu Bin arrived in Washington on the 13th of last month, met with the Papal Representative to the United States, and held a press conference at the Chinese Embassy, delivering an important written speech correcting the Japanese international propaganda that falsely accused China of being communist. Bishop Yu first pointed out: In recent years, the Japanese have been spreading the "anti-communist" war doctrine in the United States to stir up American isolationists to oppose the U.S. government's aid to China; then used the facts to illustrate that China's War of Resistance is not only for survival but also for humanitarian justice. The Japanese "anti-communist war" fallacy is just like Hitler and Mussolini's advocacy of "anti-communism," while in reality, they are overthrowing democratic politics, expanding territory, and implementing their policy of aggression. American newspapers have all published Bishop Yu's remarks. On February 19, overseas Chinese in New York held a "One Hundred Ambulance Movement Rally" under the leadership of Bishop Yu. More than 10,000 people participated, raising more than one million U.S. dollars in four hours.

We hope that people in friendly countries will pay attention to Bishop Yu's remarks and the facts that countless Catholic and Christian leaders have led church members to participate in the united front of the heroic War of Resistance over the past twenty months. We hope that the Chinese people, especially overseas Chinese and the media and education sectors, can take Bishop Yu as a model to expand the publicity of national salvation and correct the vision of China and foreign countries. We should especially give relentless blows to the Japanese and traitors who spread the rhetoric of Japan waging an "anti-communist war."

### Strengthening Aid to China Line

After the announcement of Britain's re-loan of £5 million to China, China's financial situation has become more optimistic, and the international aid to China situation is developing day by day. A Shanghai dispatch on the 12th stated: According to news from Paris, France will also soon ship a large number of armaments to China. News also stated that China and France have reached an agreement that the French side will transport 300 military transport vehicles and 200 mortars currently in the Netherlands to China, and 300 French experts will be dispatched to China to assemble the armaments. Furthermore, the London China Conference held on the 11th called on the UK, the US, and democratic countries to implement economic sanctions against Japan, and Labor MP Noel-Baker called on the UK to cooperate with the US and France to sanction Japanese aggression, saying that this move would not only benefit China but also save Japan from danger. From this, it can be seen that the democratic and peaceful countries are uniting to actively aid China and sanction Japan. We must strengthen our national diplomacy efforts to promote this movement. At the same time, we must adhere to the united war of resistance and step up the elimination of all conspiracies of "peace," "compromise," and "understanding the Sino-Japanese War."

### Soviet Foreign Policy

A Moscow dispatch on the 11th stated that Stalin spoke at the 18th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, righteously condemning the policy of compromise with the aggressors pursued by some peaceful democratic countries, and finally reiterated the Soviet foreign policy as:

(1) Continue the policy of peace and promote commercial relations between the Soviet Union and other countries;

(2) Guard against provocateurs who attempt to draw the Soviet Union into international wars;

(3) Use all methods to strengthen the strength of the Soviet Union's navy;

(4) Enhance the unity and friendship between the Soviet Union and all countries concerned with peace.

At this time of increasingly urgent international situation, the leader of the Soviet Union, sought by the world, spoke and condemned the policy of compromise with the peace-loving countries and the aggressors. This is enough to refute the rumor that the Soviet Union does not care about the suffering of the invaded countries, and to greatly strike the rumor. Reiterating the four points of foreign policy, on the one hand, fully demonstrates the Soviet Union's determination not to threaten other countries. For the "anti-communist" and "anti-Soviet" conspiracies of aggressors such as Japan, Germany, and Italy, it should be a major blow; and on the other hand, it also fully shows that "the Soviet Union cannot be threatened by others," which can increase its credibility in the world, and its policy of establishing a grand alliance of peaceful countries and realizing a collective security system to seek world peace is even more necessary for the world today.

### A Tragic Memory: An Eyewitness Account of Austria's Downfall

— Translated by Dong Ping

Vienna, March 10, 1938.

It was a cold, foggy, and gloomy morning in March. The harsh winter had reluctantly departed, and the early spring, eagerly awaited by all, had not yet arrived. This day will be forever etched in the hearts of those who experienced it firsthand, never to be forgotten.

If you had walked the streets of Vienna on the morning of March 10th, you would have undoubtedly noticed a peculiar atmosphere, suggesting that something extraordinary was about to happen. Thousands upon thousands of posters and leaflets were scattered throughout the streets and alleys, carried by gusts of wind to every corner of the city. These leaflets contained the order issued by Chancellor Schuschnigg from Innsbruck the previous night, setting March 13th as the date for a national plebiscite to determine the fate of Austria.

Groups of municipal workers were busy painting government slogans on sidewalks, shop windows, and along the walls of streets. Countless flags fluttered from shop entrances, and large warning signs were attached to lampposts and trees, expressing a vow to support the government to the death.

Teams of patriotic youth groups marched through the streets, constantly chanting slogans to protect the Chancellor. Chancellor Schuschnigg was scheduled to return to Vienna from Innsbruck by express train at eight o'clock that morning.

There was not a trace of instability. As the young people marched through the streets, cheering, the people standing by echoed their support for the government and the Chancellor. It was generally believed that the success of the vote was a foregone conclusion.

When Chancellor Schuschnigg's train arrived, nearly ten thousand people crowded the square in front of the station. As soon as the Chancellor stepped off the train, he seemed to immediately hold a meeting in the station office. About twenty minutes later, he walked to the car that was waiting outside the station. His face was very serious and pale; he did not look at the crowd. His attitude was clearly different from that of the crowd that was cheering him as "Austria's Savior." His car quickly drove along the Mariahilfer Strasse, through the arena, past the Parliament building and the Burgtheater, and headed straight for the Chancellor's office in the Ballhausplatz.

Wherever the Chancellor passed, the crowds cheered enthusiastically. This was the last time the people of Vienna saw their Chancellor, Schuschnigg.

For the next few hours, the situation was generally calm. It was evident that the National Socialists had indeed caught Schuschnigg off guard with the sudden announcement of the plebiscite, leaving him at a loss. They were waiting for new instructions from Berlin. However, around eleven o'clock in the morning, small groups of Nazi demonstrators began to appear in the area around the arena; however, most of them were young boys. They shouted the Nazi slogans: One People, One Nation, One Leader. But it was futile. They could not compete with the government supporters in terms of numbers or volume.

Police were rarely seen. Undoubtedly, they were following the secret orders of Interior Minister Arthur Seyss-Inquart not to interfere with the Nazi demonstrators. Therefore, they did not arrest a single one. Only when Nazi figures were surrounded and beaten did they rush to provide protection.

By noon, the crowds at the intersection of Kärntner Straße and near the Kent Straße had become so dense that it was impossible to move. The police were extremely busy; even they seemed panicked and confused. Several police officers openly admitted that they had received conflicting orders from all sides in the past few hours.

At first, the Nazis only sent young men and women aged fifteen to twenty to run around in the streets. Now, groups of older people were also appearing on the streets; some were wearing black boots, indicating they were members of the Blackshirts, and others were wearing the short socks of the Sturmabteilung uniforms. However, soon after, the streets once again became the domain of government supporters, as a group of several hundred Catholic and Fatherland Front students suddenly swarmed out of the alleys, drove the Nazi demonstrators out of the competition arena, and chased them to the streets of the Eighth District. This was the first and last time that the government supporters had a successful showing that day. Even the police were on the government's side.

By two o'clock in the afternoon, Nazi figures had completely disappeared from the entire First District and the area around the arena. Everything was under the complete control of the patriots.

But this did not last long.

For some unknown reason, the students suddenly retreated, and a quarter of an hour later, the Nazis all came back. To avoid clashes between the two sides, the police blocked off the middle of the Kärntner Straße, leaving half the street and a sidewalk on each side. In the eyes of the police, this undoubtedly equated the supporters of the government with those who sought to overthrow it.

This fact was clear to both groups of demonstrators. As a result, the government supporters appeared disheartened, and their numbers also decreased significantly, as many of the leaders went home for lunch. Meanwhile, the Nazi shouts grew louder and more aggressive.

At the same time, shop owners began to close their doors and lock their windows. Women, who had previously played an important role on both sides, also became less enthusiastic. The shouting in the streets continued incessantly, followed by the sound of stones breaking windows, which rang out one after another.

A moment of silence, as quiet as a church. But shortly thereafter, the inevitable happened: the National Socialists suddenly broke through the police cordon—who offered little resistance—and pounced on the group of patriots. A melee ensued. Hats, sticks, suitcases, umbrellas, belts, and everything else became weapons. Obviously outnumbered, the patriots were forced to retreat towards Stephansplatz, where they made their last stand.

An old man, wearing a bowler hat and a leather jacket, like a retired soldier of the Imperial Army, suddenly rushed forward, seized an Austrian flag that had fallen from the front of a shop, and led the crowd forward. They were only about a hundred people, but they managed to reclaim most of the Kärntner Straße from that large group of swastika people. However, near the Kapuzinerkirche, they encountered the police. After a fierce fight, their flag was taken, and that brought an end to it. From then on, everything belonged to the Nazis. The time was 3:45 p.m. on March 10, 1938.

This is a time that everyone should remember, because it only happens once in a thousand years. At that time, Austria was lost.

Not on March 11, when Schuschnigg announced his resignation, nor on March 13, when Hitler announced the annexation of Austria. In reality, it was at 3:45 p.m. on March 10, 1938, near the Kapuzinerkirche, that Austria truly fell. (Translated from the "Deutsches Nachrichtenblatt für Ostasien" of Hong Kong on March 10.

### Hong Kong Compatriots Solemnly Commemorate the Anniversary of Premier Sun's Death at the Queen's Theatre Yesterday: Premier Sun's Spirit is Entrusted to the People, and We Should Carry Forward His Spirit

Yesterday marked the 14th anniversary of Premier Sun Yat-sen's death. All Hong Kong community organizations flew their flags at half-mast to express their condolences. The All-Circles Relief Association led Hong Kong compatriots to the Queen's Theatre at 10:30 a.m. yesterday to hold a commemorative meeting in order to promote Premier Sun's spirit of creating the Republic of China. Celebrities from all walks of life and representatives from community organizations attended. In addition to a simple and solemn ceremony, reports on Premier Sun's life and speeches were given by revolutionary pioneers He Xiangning, Ye Gongchuo, Zheng Hongnian, etc. The atmosphere of the entire venue was extremely solemn and the mood was tragic. The meeting gradually concluded at twelve o'clock. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:

The Setting of the Venue

The Queen's Theatre was used as the venue. A white cloth banner was hung in front of the door, reading "Commemorative Meeting for the 14th Anniversary of Premier Sun Yat-sen's Death." On both sides were girls from the Lizexue Middle School Girl Scout Troop, standing on either side, energetic and full of solemn and heroic spirit. The hall was decorated very simply. In the center of the platform hung a portrait of Premier Sun, lifelike, inspiring admiration in all who saw it. On the left and right were the Party and national flags, with a banner reading "Commemorative Meeting for the 14th Anniversary of Premier Sun Yat-sen's Death" also hung on the flags. A row of chairs was arranged on the platform for the chairman and veteran revolutionaries staying in Hong Kong. A table and a microphone were placed in front, and the tables behind were covered with blue and white satin. The silver band was arranged in front of the stage, and the girl scouts stood on all sides to maintain order. The atmosphere inside was extremely solemn and dignified, and everyone paid infinite respect to Premier Sun's great spirit. At the same time, they felt the great responsibility of those who came after him. Celebrities present on the day included Ye Gongchuo, He Xiangning, Qu Fangpu, Madam Wu Tiecheng, Zheng Hongnian, Luo Yiqun, Mr. and Mrs. Xu Qian, Madam Wu Chaoshu, Ye Lanquan, Liu Qingxuan, Chen Tieyi, etc., as well as male and female students from schools in all fields, representatives of various organizations, etc., more than ten people. Chairman Ye Gongchuo led the ceremony as required and delivered an opening speech. Ye Gongchuo's speech briefly stated that all comrades present, today is the 14th anniversary of the death of Mr. Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang. Looking back to this day fourteen years ago, unfortunately, the Premier passed away in Beijing. In these fourteen years, the changes in the world situation and the changes in personnel have been extremely complex. We are in a period of severe national crisis, remembering that the Premier took great risks and went through great difficulties to create the Republic of China. We feel extremely sad and ashamed. In the past ten years, outstanding party members and elders such as Liao Zhongkai, Tan Yankai, Hu Hanmin, Gu Xunqin, and Deng Zeru have passed away one after another. This is indeed a great loss to our party. Everyone must know that the Premier is not a relative or friend of our family or clan, but the Father of the Republic of China, the pioneer of the Chinese nation, and the savior of the Chinese nation. Although his tangible form has diminished with matter, his spirit will always exist. But his spirit is indeed entrusted, and at least part of it is entrusted to the people of the whole country. We should try our best to express this great spirit in facts. I remember that when the Premier passed away in Beijing, he was still concerned about the country's affairs. The detailed situation will be reported by Mr. He. "The Premier's greatness, the meaning of today's meeting, please do not think that it is a kind of etiquette, or only belongs to the relationship between relatives and friends. Now our country, that is, the Republic of China created by the Premier, is in grave danger. We must preserve and revitalize what the Premier has painstakingly built, so that we are worthy of being members of the nation and worthy of the Premier's spirit in heaven. Although we are in Hong Kong today, there are as many as one million compatriots in Hong Kong. I hope that after today, everyone can have a deep understanding of the national situation and the world situation, so that it is enough to express the meaning of this commemoration. May everyone be healthy."

Deng Hongnian's Report

Then Zheng Hongnian reported on the life of Premier Sun Yat-sen, saying that today is the day when our Premier Sun passed away in Beijing 14 years ago and bid farewell to our compatriots forever. It is one of the saddest days. Taking advantage of this commemorative meeting, brothers will briefly tell the compatriots present the situation when the Premier passed away in Beijing and the process of his illness. Since the Premier has been running around for the revolution, he has been fighting for China's peaceful reunification all the time. The Premier's trip to Beijing was not to compete for the status of the people and land, but to discuss China's peaceful reunification with Duan Qirui, Zhang Zuolin, and others. At the same time, he requested the dispatch of cadres abroad to contact various countries in the world to abolish our country's unequal treaties. Unexpectedly, not long after arriving in Beijing, his old illness relapsed and he passed away in Ping. The Premier's great revolutionary spirit should be emulated by today's young people. The Premier fought for China's peace, so he said that he would unite the world to treat our people equally and fight together, so that the whole country would be united in good faith from top to bottom, and we would have unified long ago if we had embarked on this path, why wait until today. We want the revival of the people, just as the Premier said, we must struggle. The Premier once said that if our country is unified, twenty years later, it will be the strongest country in the world, and then unite the weak and small people of the world and the nations that treat us equally to seek world peace, not like the current imperialist countries, which invade all day long. I hope that all Hong Kong compatriots should promote the Premier's spirit of peace to the international community as much as possible, so that people from all countries will know that the Premier's spirit is to fight for world peace, so that we can show our country's spirit of resistance. Our country has been resisting for almost two years. In these two years of resistance, the spirit and performance of our government, the generals in front, and the people in the rear, especially the spirit of peace and struggle left by the Premier, have been admired by all countries in the world. This is all due to our top leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who has fulfilled the Premier's unfinished will. Then Ms. He Xiangning gave a speech on the greatness of Premier Sun (already published in yesterday's newspaper). Finally, the veteran revolutionary Xu Jilong gave a speech on the spirit of the Premier. The meeting adjourned at about twelve o'clock.

He Xiangning's Speech

Following was a speech by Ms. He Xiangning. She was wearing a black-spotted dress and a black felt hat. Everyone paid close attention to her, because she was old and sick, and every time she spoke, her emotions were so intensely affected that she needed to rest for three to five days to recover after her speech. She first described the brief history of the Premier's founding of the Kuomintang, and then she talked about the Premier's last words in his will, "uniting the world's nations that treat us equally." This teaching means that now the United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and many other countries are treating our nation equally, especially the United Kingdom, which recently loaned us a huge amount of money to help our displaced compatriots. This should be especially thanked." A burst of thunderous applause interrupted her words. Then she said that the Premier was not a man with an army of 100,000, but just the son of a middle-class family, a medical student, and from his compassionate nature, he developed the ambition to treat people and cure the country. He saw the people of the whole country suffering from the brutal oppression, and making painful groans like the sick, so he decided to revolutionize and save all the patients in China!" Another burst of thunderous applause, her breathing was a little tight, but she continued to say, "Fellow compatriots, you are probably all very patriotic, so we should all show our strength, ×××××, we must not let down the good intentions of our international justice friends, and continue the Premier's indomitable will. We must not be discouraged, we must not be afraid of failure, everyone must be determined to succeed or die, and work hard to revitalize our new China!" Saying this, she clenched her fists tightly and stomped her feet hard on the stage. In the midst of continuous applause, she kept panting and returned to her seat. From the seat, she vaguely heard her pulse beating rapidly. In fact, some people were almost moved to tears.

Finally, Xu Jilong gave a speech. Although he was not in good health, he reluctantly struggled to describe the Premier's deeds eloquently.

The Taikoo Ship Company's Ruisheng ship sailed from Hong Kong to Haiphong yesterday. The ship was loaded with medicines and daily necessities. It was found that this batch of goods was donated by various organizations in Hong Kong and purchased by the Emergency Refugee Relief Association and the British Relief to China Branch with a donation of 50,000 yuan.

In addition, the Taikoo Ship Company charged a very low ship rental for renting out the ship to transport medicines this time.

### Central Committee Members Staying in Hong Kong Confer on Relief for Out-of-School Children

Central Committee members staying in Hong Kong believe that refugees from all over the world are gathering in Hong Kong, among whom there are countless school-age children and out-of-school young people. In order to prevent them from wasting their school years or dropping out of school during their escape and to cultivate talents, they specially convened a meeting the day before yesterday. The attendees were Hu Wencan, Lu Yougang, Huang Linshu, Luo Yiqun, Chen Ce, Deng Qingyang, and others, and Lu Kuangwen and others were present. Lu Yougang raised the issue for discussion. After the meeting, Hu Weiyuan said that relief for out-of-school children is an important issue at present. This matter should be entrusted to Xu Chongqing, director of the Guangdong Education Department, before he leaves Hong Kong and returns to Shao. In the future, some civilian schools will be established in Hong Kong, and the school site will be borrowed from various Chinese schools in Hong Kong. All out-of-school students will be admitted, and tuition fees will be waived. If necessary, only book fees will be charged, and the minimum cost will be used or completely waived so that out-of-school students can continue their studies. At the same time, in order to provide relief for unemployed educators, it is designated to recruit unemployed teachers to take up teaching positions and provide the minimum living expenses to take care of both sides and achieve a double benefit.

### The Minying Ship Sinks a Sampan and Two Women Fall into the River and Are Rescued

The Minying ship, a Hong Kong-Cheung Chau ferry, was coming from Cheung Chau to Hong Kong at 7:30 p.m. today. When it was about to depart, the ship reversed, and a sampan in the rear was unable to avoid it and was sunk by the Minying ship. Two egg women on the sampan fell into the sea and shouted for help. The Minying ship immediately stopped and threw life buoys to rescue them. However, it was already night, and the sea was very dark, making rescue extremely difficult. Fortunately, there were many large fishing boats nearby, which used electric hand lamps to illuminate and see where the two egg women were, and they were rescued. However, the sampan was sunk. This incident delayed the Minying ship's arrival in Hong Kong by several tens of minutes.

### The Hong Kong Guide Industry Will Hold a Meeting This Afternoon to Establish Rules and Regulations to Improve the Profession

In major cities of various countries, there are original guide agencies, which are purely for guiding tourists from all over the world, admiring scenic spots, and attending banquets and entertainment venues. Those who work in this profession have no improper actions. Hong Kong is only in the midst of prosperity, and the establishment of this kind of business is necessary to guide visitors to visit. Among them, the Hong Kong guide industry is also booming. However, some guide agencies use the name of guide to cover up other businesses, which is highly criticized by people in society. It is heard that the Hong Kong government is considering whether travel agencies can exist for the sake of maintaining social morality. Therefore, those who have applied for approval to establish travel agencies in recent days have not been answered. Some people who are enthusiastic about social education have once convened the persons in charge of various guide agencies to discuss ways to improve their profession and formulate rules to punish unscrupulous guides, so that they can return to the right path and be guides for the sake of guiding. The responders include Hollywood Great China, Metropolis, Xianghai, New New, Royal Palace, Nanfeng, Peach Red, Golden, Red Star, Traffic, South Needle, Guide, Kowloon, Champion, Xianhe, etc. more than ten companies. It is heard that a meeting will be held at 1:00 p.m. this afternoon to pass the rules and regulations so that all guide colleagues can abide by them and file them with the Chinese Civil Affairs Department. It is heard that a voluntary guide will be held soon to fulfill the obligation of saving the country.

### The Overseas Chinese Machinery Engineering Team in Penang Returns to China to Serve and Passes Through Hong Kong on the Anhui Ship Yesterday, Bringing a Large Batch of Medicines

Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese have spared no effort to donate money or return to China to serve. There have been several batches of drivers' teams returning to China, and there is still a constant stream of them. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, another group of the Overseas Chinese Machinery Engineering Team in Penang returned to China to serve on the Anhui ship and arrived in Hong Kong. There were 33 members in the team, including one woman. According to the team leader Liang Yutang, the team believes that the motherland is in trouble and the situation is serious. At the same time, there is a shortage of drivers and team members. The team members, seeing this, resolutely sacrificed their original occupations and joined the machinery workers to return to China to serve. The Penang Machinery Workers' Association has a total of 2,000 people, and their lives are extremely difficult, but they are very enthusiastic about donations. Almost every worker allocates 30% of their salary to be used for relief work. The team passed through Hong Kong this time, first passing through Singapore, where they stayed for about ten days, and were treated with courtesy by the local compatriots. The team started its journey to Hong Kong on the 17th, and was also well received by the ship's staff. When they arrived, they were welcomed by members of the Chinese Machinery Workers' Association. Brothers feel very happy, but they are determined to do their best to serve the country. As for the date when the team will return to the mainland to serve, it has not yet been decided and will be implemented after reporting. This time, they brought back a large batch of medicines. The list of team members is recorded as follows: Team leader Liang Yu, Yu Guosheng, Deng Bingxiang, Wang Fuxing, Liao Jiaxiang, Zhou Wengui, Wu Tiansheng, Fan Ronghui, Liang Jinhong, Ye Qingquan, Luo Huogui, Guo Canhua, Xue Wei, Wu Ruitian, Zhou Ruirong, Wu Fuji, Huang Renda, Lin Wenqi, Chen Jinyou, Xu Rong'an, Huang Jinfu, Zeng Qinglin, Shi Songmin, Chen Bingji,

### The Women's Temperance Association Banquets Celebrities Yesterday

Since its establishment, the South China Branch of the Chinese Women's Temperance Association has organized the First Refugee Industrial Society, which has achieved remarkable results. The association has recently prepared to establish the Second Industrial Society. Yesterday, the association's members Liu Wang Liming, Li Wang Huazhen, and Liang Bao Ci jointly invited celebrities from all walks of life and famous Hong Kong opera actors to a luncheon at the Great China Hotel. Among those who attended were Xu Shiying, Zheng Hongnian, Ye Gongchuo, Miss Jin Suqin, Miss Lu Lan, and others, totaling more than 50 people. First, Liu Wang Liming gave a speech, reporting on the recent work of the Women's Temperance Association and the preparation for the Second Refugee Industrial Society, and incidentally reported on the situation of this session of the Political Participation Council. The establishment of the Second Refugee Industrial Society requires a lot of funding, so we especially ask for assistance from all sectors. On the one hand, we plan to ask famous Hong Kong opera actors and playwrights to help us with charity performances to raise money. After the speech, Xu Shiying gave a speech, praising the achievements of the Refugee Industrial Society. Then Ye Gongchuo and Zheng Hongnian gave speeches one after another. The banquet ended at 2:30 p.m. It is heard that Yihua opera actors and others have now begun to prepare for a Peking opera performance, and will also invite Ms. Jin Suqin, a salvation opera actress who recently arrived in Hong Kong, and other famous Peking opera actors to perform together. At that time, there will be a new and refreshing Peking opera performance.

### Nanfan Nine Counties All Report Rice Shortage: Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce Discusses Relief

Since [omission] entered Guangzhou, the various areas of Guangdong province have faced the risk of food shortages due to disrupted transportation. Adding to this, a certain large company has been massively buying and exporting rice from rice-producing areas, exacerbating the public panic. Earlier this year, the Chaozhou and Meizhou areas requested the Ministry of Finance to grant tax-free import of foreign rice due to rice shortages. Recently, nine counties, including Nanfan, Zhongshan, and Shunde, have also seen food panic. The military and political authorities in these areas have successively telegraphed the National Government and the Ministry of Finance, requesting measures to be taken to alleviate the situation and maintain food supply. The Zhongshan County Wartime Food Committee yesterday sent five representatives, including Li Delian, Huang Jinzao, Liu Xutang, Li Xingjie, and He Lücong, to Hong Kong to discuss relief measures with the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. To this end, the Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a joint meeting of the board of directors, the price stabilization committee, and the disaster relief committee for 7:30 PM this evening (13th) to discuss fundamental and effective relief methods. Meanwhile, the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has also scheduled a meeting for tomorrow to address this issue. Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Li Xingjie, a representative of Zhongshan County, to inquire about the local rice shortage and the relief measures planned for the future. Mr. Li provided the following information:

Li Xingjie Discusses the Causes of the Rice Shortage

According to Mr. Li, Zhongshan County usually produces enough rice to be self-sufficient, with a surplus for export to neighboring areas. On average, the annual yield can meet the county's needs for two years. Under normal circumstances, a rice shortage should not occur. The reason for the current rice shortage is that a certain large rice company has been buying massive quantities of rice, estimated at four to five million dan, whenever new rice comes on the market and prices are low, and then exporting it to Macau. At the same time, neighboring counties such as Xunde and Xinhui, which do not produce enough rice for their own needs, also absorb a significant amount from Zhongshan. Due to this large-scale export and consumption by neighboring counties, the rice supply in Zhongshan County has become scarce. Furthermore, [omission] aircraft have been bombing various areas of the county, and rice merchants fear that their rice granaries may be burned down, resulting in total losses, so they dare not store large quantities of rice.

Nanfan Nine Counties All Report Grain Shortage

Now that rice storage is scarce, and the import tax on foreign rice is high, the price of domestic rice has risen opportunistically, and rice merchants are taking the opportunity to manipulate the market. The rice shortage is getting worse day by day, and the suffering is evident. Currently, in the Shiqi area, one yuan of national currency can only buy five catties of rice, and one hundred catties of grain also cost twelve yuan in paper money. This situation is not unique to Zhongshan County; nine counties, including Nanfan, Shunde, Xintai, Kaiping, and Enping, are experiencing the same difficulties. Moreover, the Guangdong Provincial Food Regulation Committee stopped working when Guangzhou fell, and there was no way to regulate the food supply. The former county magistrate requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt taxes on imported foreign rice and to organize price stabilization and establish a price stabilization committee to start relief efforts. Because there is a Zhongshan Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce established in Hong Kong, the local authorities sent five of us to Hong Kong to consult on relief efforts, hoping that our fellow villagers in Hong Kong would consider their hometown's plight and provide as much assistance as possible. The Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce has agreed to convene a joint meeting to discuss the import of rice into the mainland and organize price stabilization to help the people.

Representatives Return to Macau to Seek Advice

To this end, representative Li Delian returned to Macau this morning (yesterday) to inquire about the amount of rice needed locally and the methods to be used, so that he can provide opinions based on the information obtained at the joint meeting. Representative Li is scheduled to return to Hong Kong tomorrow (today) to attend the joint meeting. The detailed plan will only be announced after the results of tonight's (today's) discussion. Mr. Li also said that Zhongshan's rice production has always been considered abundant, but now there is a feeling of rice shortage. The plight of neighboring counties that do not produce enough food for themselves must be even more dire. Originally, organizing price stabilization in conjunction with the nine counties would be a smooth and effective approach, but the quantity needed or the relief methods needed are different in each region, so it has not been possible to reach a consensus. Only Zhongshan County has sent us brothers to Hong Kong first to request relief, and so on. The reporter then asked about the recent situation in Shiqi and other places in Zhongshan. According to reports, no [omission] aircraft have been seen in the county since the Lunar New Year's Day. Most of those who fled to Hong Kong and Macau some time ago have returned to the mainland because the cost of living is too high.

### After [Omission]'s Invasion of South China, Hong Kong's Trade with China Suffers Unprecedented Blow, Plummeting to Just Over 23 Million Yuan in January This Year; The Bleak Situation Has Not Been Seen Since 1925

Last year, Hong Kong's trade figures totaled 113,071,214 yuan, of which trade with China accounted for 46,399,816 yuan, approximately 41 percent of the total. The monthly average was approximately 38,665,985 yuan. However, in January of this year, Hong Kong's trade with China plummeted to 23,816,362 yuan, a reduction of 15 million yuan. This phenomenon did not start this year, but began to decline in October of last year. The following is a list of Hong Kong's monthly trade figures with China last year:

January: 36,317,463 yuan
February: 32,421,618 yuan
March: 96,098,206 yuan
April: 52,103,987 yuan
May: 47,085,749 yuan
June: 36,330,223 yuan
July: 32,467,020 yuan
August: 34,511,954 yuan
September: 46,508,660 yuan
October: 118,365,569 yuan
November: 37,287,371 yuan
December: 23,479,895 yuan

According to the table above, the average monthly value is 38,665,985 yuan. The average for the first nine months is 41,690,998 yuan, while the average for the last three months is 29,710,945 yuan. The reduction in the last quarter was indeed due to the impact of the [omission] army's invasion of South China, with October and December being particularly severe. Although November showed a slight recovery, this was due to the large-scale export of Chinese tea through Hong Kong. The following is an analysis of Hong Kong's trade with North China, Central China, and South China:

Total for the Year

North China: 78,133,726 yuan
Central China: 40,645,127 yuan
South China: 245,212,963 yuan

Monthly Average

North China: 34,844,477 yuan
Central China: 3,387,094 yuan
South China: 20,434,414 yuan

Judging from the above figures, both North China and Central China have declined compared to the average since October. Only North China showed a slight recovery in November due to tea exports, while Central China also showed a significant increase this year. Since October of last year, Hong Kong's trade with South China has plummeted, especially in January of this year. The bleak situation has not been seen since the great strike of 1925. The reduction in Hong Kong's trade with China is mainly due to the invasion of South China by [omission], followed by the [omission] blockade of the Pearl River, which has had a significant impact. South China is the most important part of Hong Kong's trade with China. Unless the Pearl River is fully opened, it will be difficult to restore the previous prosperity. In the year before Guangzhou was captured, Hong Kong became the center of Chinese trade due to its special environment. The import and export of goods from Central and North China were all transported through the Kowloon-Canton and Canton-Hankou railways. Therefore, the main products of Central and North China were all concentrated in Hong Kong. Tea, in particular, accounted for an important part of Hong Kong's trade last year. The total value of tea imports last year was 16,926,951 yuan, and the total value of exports was 16,808,814 yuan, of which 9 million yuan was transported to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok. Since the successive loss of Guangzhou and Hankou, the traffic on the Canton-Hankou Railway has been cut off. Hong Kong, which used to be a distribution center for Chinese goods, no longer exists. Although trade with North China can still reach the standard, it will inevitably decline gradually. There is no doubt about this. Because the [omission] army is blockading the Chinese coast, the center of Chinese trade will inevitably shift to Hanoi and Burma. Secondly, [omission] are implementing their economic aggression policy in North and Central China, and are controlling foreign exchange and all trade. This has dealt a major blow to Hong Kong's trade with China. Therefore, the future of Hong Kong's trade with China is of great concern.

### Shijian Middle School Scheduled to Start Classes

Due to various reasons, National Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou was unable to move the affiliated middle school to Yunnan with the university, and has decided to temporarily suspend operations. In order to continue their studies, the students of the affiliated middle school held a meeting and decided to attend classes at the Hong Kong campus of Shijian Middle School. Shijian Middle School has formulated detailed plans to accommodate as many students from the affiliated middle school and displaced youths from the war zone as possible. The principal of the school, Xiao Junying, and the director of academic affairs, Guan Zhaopeng (former director of affairs and librarian of the affiliated middle school of Zhongda), are actively preparing to start classes on the 16th of this month. It is reported that the school has hired many former teachers from the affiliated middle school, and student registration is also very enthusiastic.

### Air Force Reserve Directly Under the Hong Kong Government; To Be Trained at the Far East Aviation School; Can Depart to Fight When Necessary

The world war situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. To cope with this dangerous situation, the British government authorities have formed an Air Force 500 squadron to implement a plan to protect the colonies. Singapore and other places have already started recruiting air force reserves to join the air force when necessary. The Hong Kong government has also announced the recruitment of air force reserves to comply with this plan. After the above news was released, Hong Kong air force personnel were extremely active. According to the instructions of the British Air Ministry, the recruitment of applicants for training will be carried out. In the future, after being formed into an elite force, they will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Hong Kong government to assist in air defense, and will be able to fight independently even in times of emergency. It is understood that this batch of air force reserves will be trained at the Far East Aviation School at Kai Tak Airport. Under the guidance of active air force officers, they will be taught various piloting and combat skills. The training aircraft used will be small aircraft and monoplane fighters, which will be shipped to Hong Kong from England. Pilots who apply for training must pass a physical examination by a medical officer, and must be approved by the British authorities after graduation before they can become official air force reserves. The uniforms and badges to be used in the future will also be specially designed, and will be slightly different from those worn by the regular air force. After the successful training of this batch of talents, their ability will be sufficient to protect the British colonies when necessary, and they can depart to fight at any time after the government's recruitment announcement is issued.

### Dongjiang Becomes Tense Again; [Omission] Busily Deploys; Zengcheng [Omission] Attempts to Invade Longmen; [Omission] Increases in Wancheng and Also Show Signs of Restlessness; Our Troops Are All on High Alert

[Dongjiang Express News] After the increase of [omission] troops in Zengcheng, the situation in the Dongjiang area, which had been easing for many days, has become tense again. However, large armies are gathering in Heyuan, Conghua, Longmen, and Boluo, with strong formations. It is still undecided whether [omission] will look north to attack Longmen, or invade Huizhou and Boluo to the east. Currently, the target of [omission]'s movements seems to be Longmen, attempting to advance north around the periphery. The Huizhou and Boluo areas are only intended to serve as a diversionary tactic. The details are as follows:

Recent Movements of [Omission] Troops in Zengcheng

It is understood that the original [omission] troops stationed in Zengcheng were the Matsuda Unit. They have now been replaced by another [omission] unit (battalion number pending investigation). Since the 5th of this month, they have been moving along the Guang-Zeng Highway to Zengcheng, with the main force concentrated in Fuhe, and the rest distributed in various strongholds in Shiqiao, Zhucun, Luobotong, Shigang, Shinan, and Xintang. According to intelligence received by military agencies, there are now four to five thousand county troops from the Zengcheng county under [omission] control, with more than ten artillery pieces and thirty to forty tanks. In addition, cavalry and engineering units have been busy transporting along the Guang-Zeng Highway and the Zeng-Tan Highway in recent days. On the morning of the 9th, more than four hundred [omission] infantry and cavalrymen disturbed Zhengguo, attempting to test our strength. They were defeated by our defending troops. Although [omission] are planning to be restless, they still do not dare to act rashly in view of our strength. Our army is currently on high alert, ready to meet the challenge at any time.

[Omission] Plots Restlessness in the Wanlong Area

Ten days ago, most of the [omission] troops stationed in the strongholds of Shilong, Wancheng, and Taiping in Dongguan County were withdrawn. However, since the 7th of this month, more than a thousand [omission] troops have returned to Shilong, and [omission] have also increased in Taiping and Wancheng at the same time. According to intelligence, there are currently more than a thousand [omission] troops in Shilong, most of whom are stationed in the town, and another three to four hundred are stationed at the railway station. [Omission] plan to destroy Shilong Nanbian and the iron bridge, and transport the iron materials back to [omission] country. Currently, [omission] have built a pontoon bridge in Heshang, which can be connected to the Wanlong Highway, but only [omission] soldiers and cavalry can pass, not vehicles. In recent days, [omission] have been transporting large quantities of military supplies from Taiping along the Gongfeng road through Wancheng and the Shilong Railway Station, and along the Dongjiang River to Shilong town. Therefore, there are currently thirty to forty civilian ships and speedboats used by [omission] moored on the Shilong River. There are currently about five hundred [omission] troops stationed in the Wancheng area and about one thousand in Taiping, but there have been no significant movements. In summary, the [omission] troops in various strongholds in Dongjiang have been busy deploying in recent days, and seem to be planning to be restless, waiting for an opportunity to move. The commanders of the Third and Fourth Guerrilla Districts have been ordered to strictly defend against this.

### Our Army in Xijiang Prepares for Counter-Offensive; [Omission] Requests Reinforcements to Defend Sanshui; Deng Longguang Personally Inspects the Front Lines of Xijiang; Our [Omission] Forward Soldiers Do Not Make Contact

[Special News from Hekou] Recently, fresh troops have been successively dispatched to the upper reaches of the Xijiang River, heading to the front lines of Mafang, Xiaobao, Jinli, Guanghe, and Beishui to prepare for a counter-offensive in a hurry. The front-line commander, General Deng Longguang, personally inspected the defense of Xijiang, and stepped up arrangements. The [omission] chieftain Gangtian's division stationed in Sanshui has detected our army's enhanced forward deployments and is panicking, repeatedly telegraphing the [omission] headquarters in Guangzhou to request that additional troops be sent to the Sanshui Hekou area. On the 2nd of this month, An Teng, the [omission] chieftain in Guangzhou, dispatched six to seven hundred infantry and artillery from the Zhudu area, who departed from Shiwitang by train and headed to the Sanshui Hekou area. There are a total of twelve field guns, twenty-two light machine guns, and forty to fifty military technicians. In addition, the detective chief Lin Qian was sent to Hekou to preside over intelligence work, and a long wooden bridge was built in front of the Hekou Customs, directly into the river, for mooring transport ships. Recently, artillery positions have been set up at Shipaigang and Dianxian, with two cannon installed in each location. In the Jiaowei area, more than a hundred workers are building fortifications every day, only two thousand meters away from our forward sentry line. [Omission] and our forward sentries occasionally use machine guns to scan and guard, but the [omission] army's attitude is only to defend firmly and dare not advance towards our positions.

### Guangzhou Our Guerrilla Force Attacks the Zhengjin Bank; Guerrilla Force Attacks with Machine Guns and Grenades; Obtains Two Million Military Tickets; [Omission] Feared and Dared Not Resist

The Hong Kong English-language South China Morning Post published on the 10th that the Guangzhou branch of the Zhengjin Bank had been robbed and lost 200,000 Japanese yen. On the afternoon of the 11th, the "Hong Kong Daily" run by the Japanese in Hong Kong accused the report of being a rumor and slander, and malicious propaganda. The newspaper also said, "According to the Zhengjin Bank authorities, the matter is completely fictitious and not worth laughing at." Now, the Dalu News Agency has confirmed with a special quick message from its correspondent stationed in Weizhou that the robbery of the Zhengjin Bank did indeed occur. The details are as follows:

Forcibly Occupies Communications Bank Site

The Guangzhou Zhengjin Bank, which was originally established in Shameen, was closed down early after the outbreak of the war. When Guangzhou fell, [omission] forcibly occupied the old site of the Communications Bank on the lower floor of the Baigong Hotel on Taiping South Road, changed the two characters for "Communications" to "Zhengjin", and kept the two characters for "Bank". Personnel were sent to work, and [omission] military tickets were issued by the bank to absorb our national currency. The exchange rate between military tickets and our currency and paper money was also forcibly designated by the bank, with the purpose of destroying our finances. Therefore, there were many military tickets stored in the bank.

Heroes in Disguise Force Their Way in with Weapons

Our guerrilla force learned that the bank was a [omission] financial institution and decided to attack it. At the time, the First District Special Operations Team and the Guangzhou Guerrilla Force selected brave volunteers, totaling more than one hundred people. They first blended into the urban area, and arrived on Taiping South Road at the appointed time on the 8th of this month in groups. Each person wore plain clothes and carried grenades and pistols. In addition, they carried more than twenty machine guns hidden in bamboo baskets, pretending to be hawkers. At a signal, they drew their weapons, roared and demonstrated, and immediately rushed into the Zhengjin Bank. At that time, in addition to the bank's employees, there were also many [omission] soldiers guarding the bank. Seeing the large number of our team members, they dared not resist. The team members took the opportunity to obtain a large number of military tickets, with a total face value of more than two million yuan. After succeeding, they immediately withdrew. The [omission] army could not come to the rescue in time, and our entire team withdrew from the urban area without losing a single person. It was found that when attacking the bank, except for dozens of warning shots, grenades and machine guns were never used, which shows how easy it was to succeed.

[Omission] Military Ticket Value Plummets

After this incident occurred, the [omission] ordered the puppet maintenance committee to try its best to cover it up, but the facts were all there and were known to many people. Therefore, the value of [omission] military tickets was greatly affected at the time. Although the Zhengjin Bank had fixed the ratio of military tickets to our national currency at 1.0 and to paper money at 0.8, the value of military tickets has now fallen sharply, which is corroborating evidence that a large number of military tickets were indeed seized. The [omission] mouthpiece is trying to obliterate the truth, but its efforts are doomed to failure.

### Statistics on [Omission] Aircraft Indiscriminate Bombing of Shaoguan in the Past Two Months

[Shaoguan Communication] Yesterday, the police authorities released news that Shaoguan is located in the north of Guangdong Province and has the Yuehan Railway passing through it, making it the military and political center of Guangdong Province. Therefore, [omission] aircraft frequently fly over and bomb indiscriminately. In the past two months, it has been bombed indiscriminately by [omission] aircraft thirty-one times, dropping a total of 994 bombs of various sizes. More than 700 civilians have been killed or injured, and more than 730 houses, shops, and public buildings have been bombed. In December of last year, there were a total of 65 air raid alerts, averaging twice a day. Now, because of the enemy aircraft's abuse, daytime business for citizens has mostly stopped, and it has been changed to nighttime.

### Obituary: The Passing of Industrialist Zhang Tuian, Memorial Service Held Yesterday in Shanghai by Various Circles

The industrialist Zhang Tuian of Nantong passed away on January 26th at his residence in Shanghai. Various industrial companies, educational and charitable organizations in northern Jiangsu specially convened a memorial service for him at the Jade Buddha Temple Auditorium on Gordon Road on March 12th (yesterday). Mr. Zhang, whose given name was Cha and courtesy name was Shuyan, was a native of Nantong. His family were farmers. His father, Pengnian, was a man of hidden virtue. In his youth, he and his younger brother Qianan studied at the Xiting Kan Clan School and both showed remarkable talent. His brother faced litigation due to academic status, draining their family resources. Zhang stopped his studies and returned home to support his parents, allowing his brother to focus on his studies. Later, he became a guest in the secretariat of Wu Zhuang in Korea. At that time, the eastern conflict was budding, and he proposed three policies to consolidate the border. Unfortunately, Wu Zhuang died of illness before they could be implemented. Recommended for the position of magistrate, he was assigned to Jiangxi and successively served as magistrate of Guixi, Yichun, and Dongxiang counties. He cared for the people, observed officials, and was well-reputed wherever he went. He skillfully resolved disputes related to missionary cases, ensuring stability and peace. He also widely promoted education to enlighten the people, which was particularly commendable. Senior officials recommended him for outstanding performance, and he was expected to be greatly used after passing the probationary period as a circuit intendant. However, he, concerned about the daily decline of national affairs and believing that only self-governance could save the nation, resigned from office and returned to Nantong with his brother Qianan to promote self-governance, starting with industry, then education, transportation, water conservancy, and improving the local landscape. Over thirty years, he gained fame both at home and abroad. All his plans had their own origins. Although views may differ between the past and present, his spirit remains undiminished. The main aspects of Nantong's self-governance were recorded in great detail by Zhang Jiuzi in his "Nine Records," which need not be discussed here. However, all of it was undeniably the result of the efforts of the Zhang brothers. All profits were used for local development, with investments totaling several million. The textile and land reclamation industries were the most profitable, plugging loopholes, gathering labor, developing land, and enriching the people's lives. This surpassed all other industries such as flour, cotton oil, shipping, and iron smelting. Mr. Zhang wrote in his family instructions that without Tuian, the younger brother's ventures would be weakly established, and without the elder brother, Qianan's ability to maintain would be insufficient. They relied on each other, and no other brothers could compare. He served as head of the county's chamber of commerce, farmers' association, and water conservancy association for over a decade, making appropriate changes and improvements. Nantong bordered the river and sea, and was connected by the Grand Canal. Farmland depended on water for its life, so water conservancy was especially important. He built over a dozen sluices and culverts, constructed over forty li of embankments, and dredged the Ronggang River, doing it repeatedly. Whenever there were floods, he would use every effort to mitigate the damage, bringing it to a level state. Heaven could not determine abundance or scarcity; this was unique to self-governance. Mr. Zhang was honest and decisive, taking on difficult tasks without complaint. His early methods were also broad and strong, reflecting his character. In the past decade, he resided in Shanghai, daily writing scriptures and chanting Buddha's name, avoiding worldly affairs. However, he still continued his charitable work, providing assistance. He fell ill last summer, and his condition worsened by the end of winter. He died at 10 PM on January 26th of this year, at the age of eighty-eight. His will stipulated that no announcement be made and no gifts be accepted.

### Special Shipping Dispatch

The American steamer "Aornos" arrived in Hong Kong yesterday from Xiaoluzong. It is confirmed that this ship was originally the "Bu Dielu Da" of the former Yi Ri Yi Tai Company, which used to operate between Zhaojiang and Haikou. After the shipowner, Mr. Peng, transferred it, the shipping route was changed. Recently, the Taifeng Company purchased it for over 200,000 yuan for routes to Zhaojiang, Guangzhou Bay, and Haiphong. It is rumored that the ship's name may be changed back to "New Bu Dielu Da."

The "Darnien," agented by Doolittle & Morrison, was originally scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong yesterday morning. However, due to heavy fog in the harbor, the ship was delayed and arrived late last night. It is scheduled to depart for Shanghai this afternoon.

The Italian postal cargo ship "Gedina Su" is now scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow and will be anchored in the central harbor. It is reported that the ship carries approximately 1,600 tons of cargo, including over 900 tons of Saigon rice.

The "Jinshan" of the Guangdong, Hong Kong & Macau Steamboat Company is scheduled to depart for Guangzhou at 9:00 AM tomorrow morning and return to Hong Kong at 9:00 AM on the 16th. All procedures will be the same as the last trip to Guangdong.

The "Jiang Ma" of the Xijiang Navigation Company has been stationed in Hong Kong for a long time. Recently, the ship has joined the Hong Kong-Macau route, departing for Macau at 4:00 PM every day and returning to Hong Kong at 2:00 PM.

The "Franconia" of the White Star Line departed from Wuyu yesterday, embarking on its eleventh world tour. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Hong Kong at the end of this month. Due to the impact of the war, the ship will not stop at Japan and Shanghai, but will instead go to Xiaoluzong, Java, and then Wuyu. This time, it carries approximately 100 tourists. Jardine Matheson is the agent in Hong Kong.

Movies and Drama

### Movie Stars After Marriage—Male Stars Often Suffer a Decline in Reputation—

For the time being, no one in Hollywood seems to be calling Clark Gable "Mr. Carole Lombard" or Robert Taylor "Mr. Barbara Stanwyck." The reason is simple: these two couples have not yet married.

This kind of title is a great insult to the husband. However, Hollywood people do not care about these formalities. Sometimes, the husband has an even higher position and salary than his wife on the screen. However, as long as he marries a female star, contrary to the usual title of "Mrs. So-and-so," he becomes "Mr. So-and-so." Moreover, naturally, his position gradually declines, while his wife's position gradually rises. No matter how glorious a movie star he was before marriage, he is often overshadowed by his wife's brilliance and becomes unknown.

Perhaps this is what makes Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck delay marriage—although not entirely for this reason, it is at least one of the main reasons. Often, the female star, because she loves her partner too much, is unwilling to see him go down this path of decline, just as Carole Lombard did not want to see Gable suffer the same fate as her ex-husband William Powell, and Barbara Stanwyck was unwilling to let Robert Taylor follow in the footsteps of Frank Fay.

In the past, these two female stars had tried hard to help their husbands maintain their positions on the screen, but it didn't work. Frank Fay left the film industry, and William Powell was always unhappy until his film "The Thin Man" appeared.

Looking at the movie stars in sweet married life now, Joan Blondell and Dick Powell are the best example. True, their life is happy, but Dick Powell's screen reputation has stopped improving. On the contrary, Joan Blondell, as a mother, is leaping forward by leaps and bounds. Before marriage, Dick's position was far ahead of Joan's. Now, their box office appeal is almost equal. What is the reason for this? Does marriage in Hollywood have such a special impact?

Generally, after a male star marries a female star, it is obvious that he is in a supporting role. Being ridiculed as "Mr. So-and-so" is not a very serious matter. What directly affects his film career is that a large portion of his original fan base is diverted to his wife.

If this is the case, a large group of his audience is lost. Once the news of his marriage is announced, his fans will go to see his new wife's next film. This is purely out of curiosity, to see what kind of woman this is who married "their star." In this way, at least temporarily, this part of the audience becomes fans of his wife. Female fans watch her films to find out what kind of beautiful woman can win the heart of this male star. Male fans think that if he didn't choose anyone else and chose her as his wife, she must be an amazing woman. These two psychologies constitute the main factors that are beneficial to the female star.

Film companies also find that the female star's box office appeal suddenly increases—although sometimes it is only temporary, effective for two or three films after marriage—so they sign contracts, increase salaries, choose good directors for her, and select better stories to use as scripts for her next film, and she truly becomes popular.

At the same time, after two movie stars get married, just because she is a woman, nine out of ten publicity efforts are focused on her, especially her photos that appear in newspapers, magazines, shop windows, and in front of theaters, leaving a deeper impression of her appearance and figure in the minds of the audience than that of the unfortunate male star.

The husband is unlucky. He doesn't get as many acting opportunities as before, and he is at a disadvantage in terms of publicity. What is worse is that the editors of magazines who are familiar with the psychology of the audience often replace the male star's photos with his wife's photos when they use the male star in the magazine. "Use his wife's photos. His fans also prefer to see her photos." That's it. This male star will never have a chance to show his face.

Only those photos of the two of them together in public places can be printed in newspapers. At least the editors are too embarrassed to cut him—this cumbersome object—out. But in those photos, he is just shrinking back as a moving background, dimly lit and extremely ugly, which has a great impact on the box office of the film. Sometimes, with his wife's help, they stand side by side facing the photographer. However, the photographer slightly changes the position, and the female star wearing light-colored clothes is two feet closer to the flash bulb. Just two feet makes a big difference. When the photo is printed, the female star's face is radiant, while he has a gloomy face, as if he is recovering from a long illness, faintly visible in the darkness. Naturally, female stars often take publicity photos, hairstyles, clothing, photos, etc. They also often teach the audience how to apply makeup and how to show beauty. These are more attractive to female audiences. As for male stars, who pays attention to their tuxedos or bow ties?

Enough, no more reasons. Looking at the history of Hollywood in the past, perhaps there is more evidence. When Franchot Tone married Joan Crawford, he was a rising star. After marriage, his career stalled. He stayed at home, drawing books, and then divorced. He went to England to rebuild his reputation and returned to Hollywood to continue his career. At that time, Joan Crawford had married Frank Fay. The decline in the new husband's reputation forced him to turn to the stage.

A better example is Lew Ayres, who is returning to the screen. When he married Lola Lane, he was a first-class star. However, we haven't heard of him since. After his divorce from Lola Lane, he had a good film that could have saved his reputation. Unfortunately, he made a big mistake and married Ginger Rogers again, repeating the same thing, declining in reputation, and then divorcing. After the divorce, he is now on the road to success again.

Others, Claudette Colbert and Norman Foster, Alice Faye and Tony Martin, Jeanette MacDonald and Gene Raymond, cannot escape this formula. Only Ann Sothern and John Payne are exceptions, one in ten thousand.

Clark Gable is afraid that he will soon become "Mr. Carole Lombard." To prevent him from escaping this formula, we really don't want to lose such a good actor.

### Silver Flower

— Xiang

Luise Rainer, although she did not win the Academy Award for acting this time, she has won the honor of the star with the most plane trips this year. Last year, she traveled between New York and Hollywood a total of forty times, breaking the unprecedented record. The most interesting time, she suddenly had a whim late at night and had to rush to New York the next day. She hurriedly put on a negligee, covered it with a sable coat, and boarded the plane. Her last trip to New York was to reconcile with her husband, screenwriter Clifford Odets. Hopefully, she will achieve her goal on this trip.

Walter Winchell said in the newspaper that there is a somewhat unstable situation between Gene Raymond and Jeanette MacDonald. However, judging from the current situation, it does not seem to be the case, because they are still using the same publicist. According to Hollywood's convention, if a couple wants to break up, they should each use a separate publicist for publicity before consulting a lawyer to counter each other.

Gene does often go out alone to watch boxing matches, and occasionally attends banquets alone. However, these are "husbandly habits" and are not surprising. But then again, if there really is a rift between them, we wouldn't know.

### Dissection of the Situation in Dongjiang

— Bai Wei

It is possible that the × people will re-invade Dongjiang and attack Huibo again, but to think that the × people have already begun to harass Dongjiang is a hasty and simplistic observation.

On the surface, the actions of the × people in Dongting in the past half month do seem like a tense situation, like the harassment of Longhua and Weining in Boluo, the raids of Paize in Zengcheng, the invasion of Zhangmutou in the Huiguan border area, and the increased mobilization of × troops in Zengcheng and Shilong. The tense state is like an arrow on the string, ready to be launched. Coupled with the threat of × planes shaking the sky, bombing Boluo today, bombing San'ao tomorrow, and then bombing Huiyang heavily, and the warships outside Daya Bay patrolling back and forth, the tension has risen even higher. Therefore, Hong Kong and Macau are vying to spread news about how the × people are mobilizing and fighting. In fact, this is entirely a cunning trick of the × to make the false seem real.

Based on concrete facts observed in recent days, the × people have absolutely no intention of invading Dongjiang. The abandonment of this intention, as the reporter said in the previous dispatch, is due to "lack of strength" rather than "willingness of heart." The weakness of the × people's military strength on the Dongjiang front has been explained many times since September. According to recent intelligence, Zengcheng has only 400 troops, Shilong has only over a hundred, Dongguan has only 300, and Shawan has more, about nearly a thousand. These are not enough to cause concern. However, due to the weakness of their military strength, the × people are internally panicked and afraid of our army's attack. They have to deliberately mystify, set up suspicious arrays, and try to cover up. First, they use defense as offense, attacking from Zengcheng and Shilong in different directions, targeting the counties of Zeng, Hui, Bo, Dong, and Bao. However, after investigation, the troops harassing Zhangmutou and the troops harassing Longhua and Changning are from the same unit, secretly and cunningly transferring the only one thousand troops to two places. Second, they take the troops that should be reinforcing the Southern Islands through Shilong and Dongguan to the sea, thereby expanding the Dongjiang's momentum and preventing our army's rapid advance. Third, they use the air force and navy to disrupt the Dongjiang inland and coastal areas, attracting our army's attention and relaxing our offensive. Fourth, they send a large number of spies to Dongjiang to spread absurd news and promote a policy of appeasement. Therefore, the villages in Dongjiang are all spreading rumors of × army invading the east and finding many × people's propaganda materials, letters of advocacy for peace, and strange leaflets. However, most of these propaganda materials are dropped by × planes at night.

However, the more the × people conceal their secrets, the more it reflects their weak military strength and internal panic. We are taking advantage of the × people's weakness and launching a heroic offensive posture. In recent days, every night, × planes have been flying to various parts of Dongjiang one after another to侦察 our army's movements. Before the counter-offensive, the × people are so flustered and helpless that they have no time to take care of themselves, let alone the strength to invade.

The military aspect of our army's counter-offensive is secret and difficult to describe in detail. Generally, the counties of Hui, Zhuan, Bao, and Dong are still designated as guerrilla areas. The main force's positional warfare will be launched between Longmen and Conghua. The people's armed self-defense groups and the regular troops responsible for guerrilla tasks are appropriately coordinated and distributed in various bases on the front line of the lower reaches of the Dongjiang.

The × people's ambition is to advance along the Dongjiang again to prevent our army's deployments from approaching. It seems that our estimations of the × people's invasion routes and military strength are all beyond the × people's ability to solve in the current environment. First, going upstream along the river, the fragile motorboats cannot operate alone, and the Dongjiang is currently dry and blocked, making it impossible to advance. Second, taking the old route from the sea, the current Huaihai and Lufeng guerrilla areas are not where our main force is located, so there is no need to adopt this. Third, going from Guangzhou to Shenzhen via the Guangjiu Road and detouring to Huibao, the route is too long and the military strength is too large. The gains and losses of this area of Huibao's coast have no major impact on our military. Fourth, attacking Hui, Bo, and Heyuan along the Huiguang Highway is undoubtedly what the × have always dreamed of. Assuming they can succeed, the minimum estimated strength to hold it is that the Huihzhou city and the surrounding area require 800 troops, Boluo requires 500, Heyuan requires 2,000, the traffic line requires 2,000 in Bogeng, 3,000 in Bohe, and 7-800 in Bohui, for a total of about 9,000 troops. Today, when the × people are trapped in a quagmire on Hainan Island, where will they find a batch of troops? In general, the × people have abandoned the offensive and are taking a defensive posture. Today is the time when the × people are agonizing and helpless.

During the × people's period of depression, they may dare to launch another adventure, concentrating light cavalry to launch short-term disturbances on the upper reaches of the Dongjiang, but the area of assistance must not dare to cross the Tiejiang by waterway, the Guanghui Road must not dare to reach Xinzhaotang, the Huizhang Road must not dare to cross Zhangmutou, and the sea must not dare to land to twenty li, because the × people's troop allocation is depleted and it is difficult to obtain reinforcements. They are deeply afraid of our army's ambush and annihilation.

By thoroughly dissecting the × situation, we can understand the battle situation in Ranjiang. First, the initiative is with us. Only we attack the ×, and the × have no strength to attack us. Second, in order to remedy the weakness of their meager military strength, the × people will actively use traitor activities, light cavalry "sweeping", and intimidating conspiracy of aircraft and ships, and buying out bandits, disrupting from it.

### Yesterday's First Division Football League: Eastern Soundly Defeats St. Joseph's; St. Joseph's Lacks a Good Goalkeeper, Xia Xian Takes Over

In yesterday's First Division Football League match, Eastern played against St. Joseph's at the Hong Kong Football Club ground. Hou Chengtong and Hua Guoxiu were resting, and Yu Qia and Xu Buyun went on the front line. St. Joseph's was also missing players and surprisingly used Xia Xian, who was not used to goalkeeping, as the goalkeeper. Eastern took advantage of this weakness and scored five goals, defeating their opponents.

Yesterday's weather was still poor, with frequent showers. The soldiers fighting on the sandy field felt that the road to Shu was difficult to travel. If they were not careful, they would become a mess. In this situation, there was no excitement to speak of. If it weren't for Cao Baoyun's affectation and Xia Xian's great convenience, there would have been some gimmicks, but otherwise it was boring.

Ten minutes into the match, the short-legged tiger Shi Du got the ball on the right and lobbed it high. Deqi headed forward to shoot, but Ma Shaner was unable to block it. Xia Xian was unable to save it, and the record was broken (1-0). After 21 minutes, Shi Zan bravely advanced with the ball and passed it to Qixiang. Qia Xing received Qixiang's pass and quickly crossed it. Xia Xian was out of touch with the times and tried to intercept it, but Li Si swept the ball in and it went into the empty goal, making it 2-0. Not long after, the half-time whistle blew. Changing sides to fight again, Eastern still occupied the upper hand. After 18 minutes, Shi Du robbed Ellins of the ball and passed it to Lingsheng. Lingsheng lobbed it from the center of the field. Xia Xian jumped high to catch it, but missed it. The ball hit the top of the goalpost and bounced off Xia Xian's shoulder. Xia Xian accidentally pushed the ball into the net, scoring an "own goal." The spectators burst into laughter (3-0). After 30 minutes, Eastern besieged St. Joseph's. Bing Tu passed the ball along the right side of the goal. Qia Xing arrived in time and flicked it into the net (4-0). After 32 minutes, Bing Tu received assistance from the left and made a contribution, making it 5-0. Eastern won a big victory.

### Tonight's Basketball Game: First Division Chung Sing vs. South China; Two Second Division Games Also Held

The Men's Open Tournament organized by the Hong Kong Basketball Association stopped all games yesterday because it was the anniversary of the death of Premier Sun Yat-sen. According to the schedule, there is one First Division game and two Second Division games tonight. In the First Division, Chung Sing will play against South China. The former was the runner-up of the last tournament. In past competitions, they often competed with the Zhongqing team. The team has famous athletes Zhang Rensheng and Chen Ruzheng. The South China team also occupies a considerable position in the Hong Kong basketball circle. Players Xiao Jiemin and Lu Enjing are also masters. Therefore, this game tonight will be a brilliant competition. As for the Second Division, one game is between Reporter vs. Li Xing. Reporter is known to be good amongst Second Division teams and Li Xing were the champions of the last summer's Meidu Cup. This game has a lot of potential. But Reporter's Mao Ziming, Chen Baoqi, and Ma Zhaohua were penalized and suspended from playing for a year and a half or a year by the previous committee members. It is difficult for the Reporter's Association to appeal, but the case has not been decided yet. Therefore, the strength of the team will be affected tonight if these players cannot play. The remaining Second Division game is between Dazhong and Chuncao. The two teams have not appeared in the Hong Kong basketball world, so it is impossible to speculate about their strength. The lists of the two First Division teams are listed below:

Chung Sing Team

Su Bohui, Ren Jiexing, Guan Yunshu, Zhang Rensheng, Guo Zhihong, Zhong Foqiang, Li Yuanfen, Chen Ruzheng

South China Team

### Classroom Games and Gymnastics Teaching Materials (1)

[Our Newspaper Special] Comrades, spring has arrived! In this precious and limited space of Hong Kong, the continuous rain during springtime presents the greatest challenge to our physical education comrades. In ordinary schools, it is already extremely fortunate to have a space the size of a gladiatorial arena, let alone an expensive covered playground (gymnasium). Therefore, the continuous spring rain is like adding a lock to the hands of our physical education comrades (a situation where heroes have no place to use their skills). This truly leaves us unable to apply our expertise. This is especially difficult for comrades coming from the mainland because the environment on the mainland is fundamentally different from that of Hong Kong – the mainland has vast spaces, spacious campuses, and places to read books and newspapers. Even without a covered playground, there is at least a spacious auditorium that can be used for physical education classes. With such a good environment, whether it is a physical education class or a lecture, no problems will arise. However, the situation in Hong Kong is not the same. Most schools are crowded with many people and limited space. Not only is there no gymnasium, but it is also difficult to find spare spaces or relatively spacious libraries. Therefore, whenever it rains, it inevitably puts physical education teachers in a difficult and helpless situation – they want to teach, but there is no suitable place; they want to cancel the class, but they cannot, cannot! Cancelling classes will inevitably affect the peace of the school and disrupt the lectures of other classes. Since they cannot teach on the playground, there is no gymnasium, and they cannot cancel the class, how should they solve this problem? Should they have the students sit blankly in the classroom or tell stories? Stories may work for young students in lower grades, but what about older students (junior and senior high school students)? This will inevitably become a problem. Therefore, to fundamentally solve the problem, we can only implement classroom games and gymnastics. However, there is also a significant problem in implementing this type of gymnastics.

### Tomorrow's Chrysanthemum

Wind and Rain Sentimental Indeed

(Special Dispatch) The previous afternoon, a lively scene unfolded at So Kon Po, where South China Southern District and Eastern played in the special Silver Shield Football Semi-Final. As the battle began, a light rain fell, but it quickly stopped. As the battle was about to end, wind and rain suddenly arrived. After a brief clearing, one could see that the Old Man (Heaven) is not without sentiment. If it had rained during the game, it would have been a major disappointment.

Counting the Dogwoods, One Man Short

War drums frequently urged, and the two armies moved together. In the South China Southern District lineup, counting the dogwoods, one man was missing. Liu Qingcai's foot injury had not healed, and he was temporarily unable to take to the field, greatly worrying General Mo. After much planning, it was decided that Guo Yingqi would play right winger. This was an occasional exercise of power, but it was unexpected that Yingqi would perform well in every aspect. General Mo indeed made appropriate adjustments.

Mike's Suspenseful Heart

When the Eastern players appeared, a burst of applause suddenly arose from the open-air bleachers on the north side. When the South China Southern District players took the field, a wave of response also surged from the covered bleachers. From this, it can be seen that the pro-Eastern and pro-South China factions each occupied one side. After the battle, a spectator in the north bleachers suddenly set off firecrackers, unclear whether it was to congratulate South China Southern District on their victory or to mourn Eastern's loss.

A Foreigner's Words Pierce the Heart

Beside me, a foreigner, sitting with his wife, often saw invasive fouls during the first half of the game, causing referee Mr. Omar to frequently blow his whistle to signal penalties. Fortunately, he handled it well. Seeing this situation, the foreigner suddenly muttered to himself, "Is that a game or a referee whistling performance?" These humorous words pierced my heart.

Obstacles Removed, Heart Still Unsatisfied

According to the open-air bleachers on the east side of So Kon Po Stadium, as the season was about to end, the bamboo structures that had previously blocked the view of the mountain in the distance for the common fans were dismantled. Therefore, on this day, the common football fans, high above, could see everything clearly. As the game was about to end, one common fan descended the mountain and attempted to climb into the bleachers to "add oil." He was spotted by the soldiers patrolling the field, who chased him, causing a burst of uproar.

Branch Transport

Liu Pohan and the current China Times sports reporter Lai Duanfu were "old companions on the football field, fond of casual chats." After the game, Xianhan walked to his old companion, who said, "You were just too unlucky today." In fact, these words were just to comfort Xianhan. Eastern's defeat was not entirely due to bad luck, but to being less skilled. (Broken Army)

### The Importance of Legs

— Wang Xuezheng

Vigorous leg exercises can not only directly develop the muscles of the back but also greatly benefit the waist and abdomen, as well as the internal organs, especially the circulatory and respiratory systems. Although other exercises can also activate these two systems and improve the function of various organs, their effectiveness is far below that of vigorous leg exercises.

To enlarge the chest and develop it to its most perfect state, one must also perform vigorous leg exercises because this type of exercise stimulates the lungs, allowing them to absorb a large amount of air.

However, vigorous leg exercises are not suitable for people with heart disease. Even healthy people should not overexert themselves when performing this type of exercise because it has a significant impact on the heart and lungs. It should be known that not only the heart and lungs, but any organ can suffer significant damage if it works too hard.

What we are now going to discuss is the deep knee bend exercise. This exercise is both an easy leg exercise and a vigorous leg exercise. In other words, it can both promote metabolism, activate the circulatory system, and make the leg muscle fibers grow, develop muscles, and strengthen the endurance and ability of the legs. In addition, it is also very effective for developing the muscles of the back, waist, and abdomen.

The method of the "deep knee bend" exercise is also very simple. Simply try to squat down as much as possible and then stand up straight. This exercise can have a significant impact on the heart and lungs. The method of breathing is also very important. If the breathing is incorrect, these two organs can also suffer significant damage. The method of breathing is to exhale when squatting down and inhale when standing up. The breathing should be deep and slow.

The most important thing when performing this exercise is to gradually increase the weight and have a certain system. We can follow the following procedure:

(1) Keep both feet parallel and separate them by about eight inches to the left and right. Then, squat down as much as possible until the arms are parallel with the thighs, and then stand up straight. The heels must not be lifted. Do this fifteen times. The movements should be slow. After finishing, rest for a while and take deep breaths for about one minute.

(2) Keep both feet in a figure-eight shape, with the heels together. First, lift the heels up as high as possible (inhale), then bend the knees and squat down (exhale) until the buttocks are parallel with the feet, and then stand up straight (inhale). After standing up straight, put the heels down (exhale). Do this fifteen times. This exercise is also beneficial for the muscles of the thighs. After finishing, also take deep breaths for about one minute.

(3) Same as (1), but when exercising, place a weight (Bas dtll) or a sandbag, dumbbells, or other equipment equal to the body weight behind the neck and on the shoulders. Alternatively, you can do without equipment and have someone ride on your shoulders, but their weight should be close to your body weight. Pay attention to maintaining a straight waist and back posture, and do not hunch your back. If you feel difficulty breathing or palpitations during the exercise, you can pause for a moment when standing up straight and take two or three more breaths, and you can also inhale through your mouth. Do this fifteen to twenty times. People with weak physical strength or an unhealthy heart can reduce the weight on their shoulders to about half of their body weight, and the number of times can also be reduced to ten or fifteen times.

After the exercise, take deep breaths for about three minutes. If you still have energy, you can repeat it again, but the number of exercises can be reduced by five times. (To be continued)

### "True Villain" vs. "Hypocrite"

— Zhang Chunfeng

Reading Mirror, Volume 8, quotes Yang Yongxiu as saying:

"The foolishness, ignorance, weakness of a ruler is not enough to destroy his country. The country is destroyed by a rigid, intelligent ruler. In a family, an unworthy son is not enough to break the family. The family is broken by a frivolous, undisciplined person. In a minister, a true villain is not enough to disrupt the country. The country is disrupted by a hypocrite." This says that a "true villain" is more forgivable than a "hypocrite." In fact, this is deduced from a relativistic point of view.

Bai Letian once used a poem to illustrate the importance of the two: "A fox pretending to be a woman harms less, deceiving people's eyes for a day and a night; a woman who is a fox harms more, deceiving people's hearts day and night." It seems that a fox pretending to be a woman to seduce and harm people is not deeply harmful. In fact, whether it is a fox-woman or a woman-fox, they should all be swept away.

Presumably, the ancients believed that the reason why a true villain is not harmful is entirely due to the clear discernment of the public. They believed that with the eyes of the public watching and the hands of the public pointing, they are carefully guarding against "villains." Of course, villains cannot use their skills freely and can only hide their tracks and run away with their tails between their legs. Therefore, the saying that "true villains" are not harmful is only established. But sometimes it is not so easy because if someone is qualified to be a true villain, they may have the methods of a true villain, covering people's ears and eyes. For example, today, Wang Zhaoming, who is hiding in Hanoi, just as after the loss of the Northeast, Wang sang "Unite as one, and face the national crisis together." In fact, he did not face the national crisis. Then, when Rehe was lost and Tianjin and Beijing were shaken, Wang sang "Negotiate on the one hand, resist on the other hand." But there was no resistance, and no negotiation either. If there was, it was probably a secret agreement. Finally, he sang the "Doctrine of Bleeding to the End" and the absurd saying of perishing together with Japan. When he was in a high position in the country, posing and shouting resistance, yelling "the final moment."

Today, in the anti-Japanese war camp, there is no room for any "true villain" or "hypocrite." We should always examine ourselves. The Bible has a saying of removing evildoers like sifting tares. Today's ×××× should also be like this. What is the sieve for sifting tares? That is the eyes, thoughts, and hands of 450 million people.

### Two Chapters Sung at Dawn

Who has not heard

The urgent voices of military women marching

Chinese people, arise

For the independence of the motherland

The freedom of the nation

Chinese people

Grasp your guns, arise

Two

Today we stand on the high plateau of northern Asia

Today we face the sun

In the blood-red dawn

We stretch out our strong arms

Showing the strength of the Chinese nation.

### Romance of Hong Xiuquan (Vernacular National Novel)

— Zheng Xiao

Romance of Hong Xiuquan, Second Collection, Twenty-Ninth Chapter, a stone print edition in the collection of Peking University, written by Huang Xiaopei of Panyu. The first part contains a preface by Zhang Binglin in Wu Nei (Guangxu Thirty-Second Year), and also a self-preface, titled "Huangdi Era Four Thousand Six Hundred and Sixth Year," which shows that the original twenty-nine chapters were written in the first year of Xuantong, only two years before the Wuchang Uprising. Zhang Binglin was also a strong advocate of revolution, so the national consciousness of this book is undoubtedly correct. I remember when the Republic of China was founded, I was in Wuhu, and I was only ten years old at the time. I saw a kind of oblong, glossy paper book popular on the streets, with a fake Western-style binding, which is now the popular paperback. The opposite page was green tissue paper, with the three words "Hong Xiuquan" written in large characters at the top, drawn in three circles, printed in black. In addition to the words, there was also a line drawing of a circle below. Each book was thin, with twenty or thirty pages, and it seemed that there were at least the first and second collections.

However, the current popular version, renamed "The Heroic Biography of Hong Yang," has been increased to 140 chapters, extending the original book fourfold. I think the 111 chapters added later, from the 55th chapter onwards, should be added by the die-hard Qing loyalists. For example, the title of the 78th chapter is "The Rebel Hong and his Ministers All Died, and the Brothers of the Zeng Family All Received Grace." This is a very glaring wording—Hong Xiuquan is called a rebel, and Zeng Guofan and others are called recipients of grace. It can truly be said to be inverting black and white. After reading it, I feel that even the writing in the first 54 chapters is better. For example, the writing of Li Xiucheng's tactics is extremely clever and interesting. It also has a scholarly air. For example, in the 30th chapter, "Shi Dakai Retires Zeng Guofan with Poetry," the original letter and five original poems by Shi Dakai are used. This is comparable to the poems of famous people added by Mao Zonggang in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. A Ying's Qing Dynasty Novel History says: "Huang Xiaopei's Romance of Hong Xiuquan, regrettably ended abruptly at the 54th chapter, and the publication period was after the Qing Dynasty was overthrown."

A detailed examination of this novel would not only be impossible due to space limitations, but I also do not have such leisure and ability. Presumably, Jian Youwen and Xie Xingyao are the most capable because they are both experts in the study of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Jian Youwen has written "Miscellaneous Notes on the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," and Xie Xingyao has written "Discussions on Historical Events of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." Other reference materials include Li Xiucheng's confession, Shi Dakai's diary, a collection of poems and essays from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Interesting Documents of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (edited by Liu Fu), Unofficial History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, Historical Anecdotes of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, etc. There are truly countless things to count, and they can at least consume several years of a researcher's time. In terms of creation, in addition to the Romance of Hong Xiuquan, the modern Chen Baichen is fond of taking material from this. I once introduced him to see the two experts, Jian and Xie. His "Jin Tian Village," also named "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," has been successful on the stage. "The Death of Shi Dakai" does not seem to have been staged, perhaps because the atmosphere of tragedy is too heavy, which does not conform to the current era of active resistance? Films and Peking operas have also used the historical events of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom as themes. I hope that there will be an opportunity for detailed research in the future.

### Random Notes on the Journey

— Hu Weizhou

White egrets were singing in the clear sky in the method of the old calendar. The troops had to linger in the camp for a whole day. Our 1,300 good men were so exhausted that some of them fell asleep wherever they lay down. I remember that the troops had just arrived here at three o'clock in the morning, and I could vaguely hear the lazy mountain gun sounds in the distance. Lao Chen and I, hungry, drank the west wind, and the situation seemed very awkward. We wanted a civilian to find some food for us. Fortunately, we ran into a local rogue. Naturally, a robber would pretend to be a scholar in front of a judge. He finally led us to a dilapidated house with a smile and a strange politeness, saying that it was his home. He then called out to an old woman to cook rice and boil tea, and he went to kill a duckling. He talked and talked, and insisted on asking us for two yuan in legal tender. Afterwards, we returned to the original place, and fell asleep on the stone steps with our clothes on, feeling at ease.

The next evening, we continued our journey. We turned from the narrow path of Mouchang onto the wide highway; but the artillery fire was still densely surrounding the entire silent mountain valley.

"Platoon Leader He, do you hear the artillery fire?... If your wife were here at this moment, she would definitely stop you and say: 'You can't go...' "

"Damn you—bookworm—always the same old thing, I'll beat you—"

"Didn't she argue with you fiercely in front of the regiment's office yesterday?"

"Um—a soldier with his wife by his side never has anything good..."

In this way, the sergeant clerk was satisfied, and his steps stepped out a victorious and arrogant tune.

The troops advanced eastward along the highway, about to reach and Lu, when suddenly a chaotic sound came through. We knew that at this time the villagers hated the darkness of the night, otherwise, in their houses, village streets, ponds, and fences, they could see the dust and sand flying all over the sky.

Footsteps, cart sounds, the scolding of women and children, and the neighing of horses, countless, tense noises, and long breaths on the pulse of the highway. Of course, the situation had never been like this before. The dogs, who usually adhered to the altar, barked wildly as if they had never done so before.

The sounds became more and more loud, so loud that they swallowed all the silence of this late autumn night. The eyes of some travelers—no, the firebirds of the refugees—shot out angry and fierce looks at the guys in our way.

Was this a refugee crossing the border? But in the meantime, it was clear that there were artillery carts and herds of horses. Was this a march? How could it be mixed with the cries and curses of women and children? This is... This is chaos, tension, sharpness, noise, crying curses... converged into a raging torrent, a flood:

Oh! This sound is our anti-Japanese army in a hurried march, infiltrated by thousands of clueless refugees coming from the opposite direction, who did not even believe in their dreams that their hometown would suddenly become a slaughterhouse. Their desperate, fleeing, chaotic sound, this sound filled with terror, misery, and trembling breath, swept over from that side, and was about to sweep to another place—the night wind blew through the wailing of × military field guns, our team Liu crossed a slope and bridge, and then advanced bravely on the plains.

### On [Cold] and [Hot]

— Tie Niu

"Cold" and "hot" are two absolutely opposite adjectives. In general, what kind of standards are required to accurately match their literal identities? The answer is: "Cold and hot are standards obtained through comparison."

Here we can distinguish the routes of "cold" and "hot": enthusiasm and coldness, hot-bloodedness and cold-bloodedness, fanaticism and calmness, liveliness and desolation. If we use "life" as an analogy, then, roughly speaking, childhood is enthusiastic about "games" and cold about "romance," adolescence is enthusiastic about "romance" and cold about "games," middle age is enthusiastic about "fame and fortune" and cold about "romance," and old age is enthusiastic about "comfort and enjoyment" and indifferent to games, romance, and fame and fortune.

What China needs now is to hold ardent emotions and a crimson heart, bravely shedding fresh, hot blood, and dedicating everything to the youth in the War of Resistance. What China does not need is cold-heartedness. "Heat expands and cold contracts" is a law of physics, but in China, it has lost half of its effect. Today, when the flames of the War of Resistance have been ignited in every corner of China, the people in the rear, no matter how severe and cold the weather is, their enthusiasm for serving their country is at its highest point. The displaced refugees, devastated by the artillery fire of the × people, are not wearing cotton-padded clothes and are being attacked by the piercing north wind, but they can instead encourage the force of resistance.

For example, on the front lines: fighting bloody battles in the frozen, snowy ground, no matter how cold the weather is, the hearts of the brave men who share the same hatred and fight heroically against the enemy are boiling with hot blood.

Everyone needs to be "hot," but being too hot can sometimes cause "cold." If you feel hot and sweating profusely, or cold and shivering with your upper and lower teeth chattering, then this "sudden cold and hot" and "unstable cold and heat" can determine that you have contracted "cold and heat sickness" and need to urgently ask a doctor for diagnosis. Take a few "quinine pills" to drive the "malaria bacteria" out of the country.

Similarly, a certain country needs a military that is both enthusiastic and brave, and politicians who are level-headed. They have close links with each other; otherwise, they lose the balance and harmony of "cold" and "hot." If it gets hot, the military will charge around wildly; if it gets cold, the brave men will be so cold that they become "war-weary" and "hang themselves." Such "sudden hot and cold" and "unstable cold and heat" will create the country's "cold and heat sickness." But this cannot be solved by simply asking a quack doctor for a diagnosis; it requires the people of the country suffering from "cold and heat sickness" to deeply realize that their country is terminally ill. If they do not urgently rise up to save it, they will inevitably perish together. Then, the people should unite with the masses oppressed by the warlords, raise the hall of resistance, and eliminate the fascist malaria bacteria—the warlords—completely.

### The Snow of Manchuria

— Shu Qun

As he approached the gate of a courtyard, he stopped and identified it: the high courtyard walls and the sturdy iron gate gave him an impression like a prison. In between, a stray dog ​​escaping the cold passed behind him, accidentally brushed against him, and then he felt humiliated, blushed, calmed himself, and immediately raised his head again, making his steps particularly neat, so that the snow under his boots sounded a kind of proud snow sound - walking mechanically toward that small door.

The gatekeeper had to ask the person entering; this had become a habit for him. However, the tone of his inquiry was determined by the entrant's dress and expression; some were humble, some were high-pressure. When he asked the entrant this time, his tone naturally belonged to the former. However, the answer he got was:

"Bastard, I come here every day, don't you recognize me?"

"Ah, I remembered as soon as I heard your voice! Yes, you come here every day. Alas, my eyes are really going blind!"

However, he knew that he was deceiving himself; but he had to apologize, shrink back, and let the master's noble and arrogant guest pass by.

This guest still lingered, expressing his dissatisfaction, and said in a reproachful tone:

"From now on, you must recognize me next time!"

After he finished speaking, he left. Then, he turned back and saw the gatekeeper walking into the gatehouse. He said silently:

"Please forgive me, I am doing this so that it will be more convenient when I leave." He also thought: "If you knew who I was, you would definitely not let me pass. If you find out who I am now, you will definitely lock the door, then..." (5)
