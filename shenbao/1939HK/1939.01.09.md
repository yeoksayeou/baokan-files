### The Contributions of Overseas Chinese to the War of Resistance

In this sacred revolutionary war against Japanese aggression, all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, regardless of whether they are domestic citizens or overseas compatriots, young or old, male or female, and regardless of party affiliation, are doing their utmost to sacrifice for the country. This spirit of national unity to overcome national difficulties is an unprecedented miracle in thousands of years of Chinese history! The fact that China will not be conquered by foreign powers, this miracle is an ironclad guarantee. On the 6th of this month, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech, elaborating on the fact that China's situation this year is much better than last year, military operations are proceeding smoothly, and the diplomatic situation is optimistic. He especially praised the patriotic enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese. All our compatriots, looking back on their past efforts, will surely work harder, and those who have not done their best in the past need not feel deeply ashamed today, because the future can be pursued. There are many places where the War of Resistance and nation-building need the help of overseas Chinese!

Now, just speaking of overseas Chinese, their great contribution in this War of Resistance is truly unprecedented. Let's take a few recent events as examples: Many overseas Chinese have traveled tens of thousands of miles back to China to voluntarily participate in the war. Recently, it was reported that a certain overseas Chinese battlefield service group of seventy people has been reduced to only twenty-one due to deaths, but their spirit is still undaunted, and they are planning to continue organizing participating groups. Even overseas Chinese who are unable to return to China are giving effective help to the motherland's War of Resistance efforts within their possible range. Recently, newspapers have also been reporting that many overseas Chinese sailors in Nanyang and the Americas have been forced to give up their jobs in order to refuse to transport military supplies to Japan. These working-class overseas compatriots do not hesitate to lose their livelihoods in exchange for loyalty to their motherland, which is enough to be moving! No wonder that recently, Chinese workers in the American transportation industry, in order to dissuade the transportation of munitions to Japan, have aroused the sympathy of the general American public, who have implemented the organization of Chinese checkpoint outposts to express their support.

As for the contribution of financial resources, the overseas Chinese are even greater. Now, overseas Chinese everywhere are holding long-term fundraising and charity sales for the motherland's War of Resistance. People from Nanyang and other places have said that overseas Chinese students, merchants, and civilians in those places often enthusiastically engage in fundraising activities that last for ten days or half a month, and the society does not find it annoying. This kind of popular spirit is really rare in the motherland! As for charity sales, many small business operators often donate all their capital to the motherland! As for percentage-based donations, there are even more, and there are also many wealthy merchants who make large-scale donations as advocates. According to the central government's report, the military expenses donated by overseas Chinese in various places in more than a year of the War of Resistance have reached 100 million yuan; and according to recent reports, the estimated amount of remittances from overseas Chinese this year will be nearly 600 million yuan. Such a huge amount is naturally an expression of the overseas Chinese's love for the motherland!

However, although the past contributions of overseas Chinese to the motherland's War of Resistance in terms of manpower and material resources have been great, given the arduousness of the motherland's sacred national revolutionary war, the support of overseas Chinese for the motherland's War of Resistance should continue to grow and not diminish in the slightest. Now that China's War of Resistance against Japan has entered the second stage, and is closer to the final victory, more war expenses will naturally be needed in the second phase of the War of Resistance, because the war zone has been expanded. Moreover, due to the urgent need for transportation construction and various materials in the rear, more financial resources will naturally be needed. This fact cannot but expect the wealthy overseas Chinese to provide strong support. Recently, it was reported that a certain overseas Chinese intends to raise 50 million yuan to engage in the development of various natural resources in Yunnan Province. We believe that there is more than just one or two overseas Chinese with enthusiastic patriotism and abundant financial resources like this person. If they can follow suit in various places, the prospects for the motherland's War of Resistance will be greatly improved! Because we must understand that the War of Resistance is not only about consumption, but also about production, and long-term War of Resistance requires the development of rear production enterprises. Therefore, this person's focus on investing in the development of natural resources can be said to be far-sighted! The current problem is that we must continue to advocate and support people in order to achieve practical results, and this matter can only be deeply hoped for by the wealthy overseas Chinese!

In terms of mobilizing manpower, with more than 10 million overseas Chinese, the resources that can be used for the War of Resistance are also very abundant. Overseas Chinese are not all businessmen. Those with military knowledge and experience can directly participate in the war. Those with expertise in medicine and engineering can also participate in battlefield service. At present, our country lacks a large number of pilots, doctors, nurses, mechanics, engineers, etc., but there are many overseas Chinese who have such specialized talents. They should quickly return to the country voluntarily to serve, without waiting for future conscription by our government. Even overseas Chinese who cannot return to the country, if they can each use their own strength and friendship with local foreign people to carry out propaganda, donations, boycotts, and other work, in order to arouse international justice and sympathy, then the magnitude of its effectiveness will be far greater than that of domestic people. Now, the government and the general public in our country all have a deep expectation for the overseas Chinese. I think that from now on, the overseas compatriots will certainly make greater efforts for the motherland with the same sentiment, in order to complete the goal of the War of Resistance!

Transportation and Travel

### Clothing, Food, Housing and Transportation in Kunming City, Yunnan

— Tianxu Wosheng

Let's start with clothing. Because it's like spring all year round, just two sets of short linen shirts and pants, one lined jacket, and one cotton-padded set are enough. Throughout the year, there's no need for a calendar, and there's no real sense of hot or cold weather. When I flew from Sichuan to Yunnan, I only brought those four sets of clothes, and didn't need to buy winter or summer clothes. There's no need for fans in the summer, and there's no need for heaters in the winter. The temperature stays around 70 degrees, and even during the coldest days, it's only around 60 degrees. However, in a single day, you can experience all four seasons. Noon is like spring, afternoon is like summer, evening is like autumn, and night is like winter. There's even a saying that "a single rain turns it into winter." So when I go out to hike in the mountains, I always bring an umbrella, galoshes, and an extra set of clothes. Otherwise, you'll inevitably experience the suffering of sudden sunshine, sudden rain, sudden warmth, and sudden cold. Fabric is sold by the "chi" (foot), with half a meter being one chi. Buying material and ready-made clothes from the National Loan Agency is the most convenient. If you're buying leather clothes, they're much cheaper than in Shanghai. Otter pelts are only 200 yuan each, which is only ten national currency. Silk is only two yuan (national currency) per catty, but cotton is six and a half jiao per catty.

Let's talk about food. It's extremely simple. In the morning, at nine o'clock, you eat rice noodles as a snack. Their "rice noodles" are like the "fen" noodles from Jiangzhe. The shops cook them well and sell them very cheaply. Laborers all eat this for breakfast. Every shop is bustling with customers. The most sophisticated shop is Renhe Restaurant. Each bowl costs one jiao (national currency). They don't use MSG; instead, they use a slow-cooked soup made from old hens and fresh mushrooms. One of the mushrooms is umbrella-shaped and very famous. So they only put the umbrella stalk on each bowl, and you can't get a single piece of the chopped umbrella cap. Lunch is eaten at five in the afternoon. Kunming time is a bit later than Shanghai time. Actually, it's already dusk. Dinner isn't eaten. If you stay up late, you can casually eat some snacks with egg yolk cakes or biscuits. The price of biscuits is about double that of Sullivan's in Shanghai. Only Yongkang makes and sells them. Wheat flour costs five jiao (national currency) per catty. Rice used to be only 7.2 yuan per "dou" (peck), which is 7 yuan per "shi" (bushel), but now it's risen by half. Vegetables and radishes are about 80% cheaper than in Shanghai now. Ducks are four jiao (national currency) each, but chickens are more than double that price. Fish is rare and very small. Only black carp is larger, no longer than a foot. The head chef at the Diecai Hotel can make it like yellow croaker. He uses White Pagoda oil to fry it on a plate, then coats it with flour batter. It's as tender as fried yellow croaker. There are absolutely no shrimp. I brought some dried shrimp from Chengdu, but they couldn't survive because the water contains too much ash acid. Even when I removed the acidic substance, it didn't work. I don't know what kind of water shrimp need to survive.

The issue of housing: Renting a house is cheap originally. The shops on South Gate Street are the busiest place. Each building, including the back building with its guest rooms, costs no more than 15 yuan (national currency) per month. Residences, such as a building with a two-story front hall and six side rooms, cost no more than 20 yuan (national currency) per month. Mostly there are seven bays, the middle two being the front hall, and three flat rooms on the left and right. One side has the main gate and gatehouse, and the other has the kitchen and servants' quarters, each with a courtyard. The three side rooms on each side have enclosed verandas, the courtyard is made into a flower bed, about ten meters square, and opposite it might have three simple flat-roofed shrines. The lavatory is invariably next to the main building, inevitably allowing the odor of latrines to reach people's nostrils. If it's a Western-style house with sanitation equipment, then the rental price is about the same as the two-story landlords in the Shanghai Concessions now. The deposit often costs 2,000 or 3,000 yuan (national currency). Lodging in guesthouses is considered very expensive if it is like that of a Sichuan Inn, and is 2 yuan per day, without meals. The grand hotel in Kunming is a modern hotel, at 8 yuan per day. They have a bathroom and a barber shop. Having the barber come to one’s room costs 1 yuan and 2 jiao, going to the barber shop only costs 3 jiao. Getting one’s back scrubbed in the bathroom costs 2 yuan, and foot massages are the same. The names are all “countryside” names. A Western porcelain toilet costs 3 yuan. There are no chamber pots. A can of bathroom cleaning powder, sold in Shanghai for 1.2 yuan, costs 0.5 yuan in Kunming; this is still national currency, not old currency. Wooden articles are very expensive, around twice that of Shanghai. A wooden bed costs 30 yuan, and an iron bed costs 40 or more. A camp bed costs 14 yuan. We buy gasoline wooden boxes to make seven-piece puzzles, each only costs 1 jiao. Because everyone has started to do the same thing, demand has exceeded supply, increasing it five-fold, but they are still very cheap, because the seven-piece puzzle board is all-purpose. Furnishings for sleeping and eating, as long as we have a hundred boxes, we are all set. Not only is it practical, but it is also aesthetically interesting, eliciting countless praises.

As for transportation, the streets are wide, all paved with bluestone. Zhengyi Road is wide enough for five cars to go side-by-side. The pedestrian walkways are left-going and right-coming, one should not mix them up. Jinma and Biji archways, and lately the [Da Nan Gate] building (i.e., the main south gate) and the Sanpailou, are shining bright, with painted beams, Walking underneath those people cannot help but feel as though they were among the palaces of Beijing. Local leather shoes are inexpensive, 8 yuan for a pair. Cloth shoes are brought in from Shanghai, and cost 2 yuan; they break after wearing them, because they are filled with lime. They are not made with calcined magnesite, so they are not sturdy. The cross-section shows honeycomb-like tiny holes. Plus, the weather is always dry, thus they break easily. Rickshaws are easy to hail; for five copper coins, one can travel four to five li. But now, at least one old coin is required, which is one jiao national currency. [drivers] will still ask to add more on. If you attempt to discuss the price, it reveals that you are a newcomer to Kunming. They will ask for a minimum of 2 yuan. During the air raid alarms, they will not depart until 30 old coins are offered. Sedan chairs are few. To hire a sedan chair is at least 10 national currency. To hire one for 8 hours costs 40 to 50 yuan. It is best to travel up the mountains by using a “Huagai chair”. It is made of two bamboo poles, with three small bamboo poles placed crosswise. One is for stepping on, and two make up the seat- a net of lines in front and back. Place a mattress, bring a rattan basket or a suitcase plus a coolie, and you have a comfortable reclining seat. I think that Huagai chairs should be used when traveling in the West. The cost of the carriers, including meals, is four jiao per carrier. There are no expenses for alcohol. They speak in slogans that are in fact rhyming modern poems. For example, the one in the front says “All the way is slippery”. The one in the back replies “Do not touch the flowers on the side of the road.” The one in the front then says “In the past, he was a seed”. The one in the back says “Next year, a large watermelon will grow.” But in fact, Yunnan only has winter melons and gourds. There are no watermelons. There is no need to eat watermelons, I wear cotton even during the hottest days of summer.

### An Account of Visiting the Kek Lok Si Temple in Penang

— Yao Zhonghuang

The Largest Buddhist Temple in the British and Dutch Possessions in Nanyang - The Overseas Chinese Display Universal Compassion - Multiple Visits are Never Tiresome, Can Eliminate Worldly Obstacles

Throughout my life, I have enjoyed playing in the water and hiking in the mountains, seeking out secluded places and antiquities. Whenever I encountered a beautiful landscape, I would spend a lot of time exploring it. The famous mountains and ancient valleys of the north and south of China have mostly been visited by me. Even the White Crane Mountain in Penang, I have visited it dozens of times without getting tired. Because I have lived in Penang for more than a year, the heat is like fire. Whenever it is a free day, when the sun is about to set, I would go with a few friends, either by car, on a slow walk, on a sedan chair, or on foot. Over time, I became close friends with the monks, entrusting myself to their care. The mountain has the Kek Lok Si Temple. A trip to its corners and a moment of touring within can dissolve the worries of the day. Multiple visits can purify the six faculties and eliminate the five aggregates. That is why I can visit it dozens of times without getting tired.

Kek Lok Si Temple is in the southern corner of Penang Island. This place has the White Crane Mountain, which is a series of verdant peaks, only a little less impressive than Mount Sumeru. During the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, a monk named Miaolian from the Zhushan Temple in Fujian came here. He built a Zen monastery, naming it Kek Lok Si Temple. Thus, the Western Paradise was moved to Nanyang. It took more than ten years to complete. The halls are magnificent, and the statues are solemn. To the left of the temple is the Ten Thousand Buddha Pagoda, with seven tiers. The ashes of the dead were placed inside in order to gain merit. The construction of this pagoda was begun ten years ago by Abbot Benchong. However, he had financial difficulties. From the start to its completion, it took almost ten years. This temple is not only the largest monastery in Penang, but also the only Buddhist temple in the British and Dutch possessions in Nanyang. It is sufficient to represent the compassion of our nation, a symbol of the love of peace. Anyone, Chinese or Western, who comes to Penang, will visit it as soon as they can. The fresh air, concentrated from the mountains and waters, is beneficial for the body to those who live there for an extended period of time. When traveling there, one must take a tram, which brightly illuminates the Five Branch Lights, going through Four Section Shops. Along the way, the willow wind and rubber tree landscape are intertwined, the dense silence is a unique sight. Sending off thoughts of the orchards in our eyes, our spirits are refreshed. Once the weariness is reduced, there are two strange stones on the left and right along the way. Both appear to be prostrating, possessing yin and yang. People call them the stones of marriage. Many lonely women go there at midnight with incense to pray, hoping to receive the blessings of the fox fairy. The tram stops at Air Itam, which is already at the foot of the mountain. Gazing above, one can faintly see the palaces and the clouds. Here, there are a few tea rooms, their fragrance blending with the aroma of flowers. After passing a small bridge and walking a few steps, there is an archway-style gatehouse, standing tall and majestic. It was built with the sole investment of Mr. Hu, a philanthropist. Thus, one can climb the steps to the other side. Along the way, strange rocks stand tall, as if nodding in welcome. The stream babbles gently, as if calling to move forward. The blooming flowers are a sight to behold. The green is intoxicating. Seeing the seeds of enlightenment, one is grateful for the fruits of Prajna wisdom. One does not notice the twists and turns of the mountain path, but rather feels refreshed in spirit. This is the first gate of the temple. Incense burners are arranged in front, the light shining brightly, causing one to feel as though one has been renewed, as if one were in Jetavana. In this middle hall, a few tables are arranged for visitors to rest. Leaving the side gate on the left, passing through a corridor and taking the path on the right, there is a large rock, carved with the four characters "Amitabha Buddha". There are three pools carved from stone, which are the release ponds. The water in the ponds is clear and rippling. The strange flowers and jade trees on the ponds have unique fragrances. Below is the nurturing pool, which has hundreds of turtles. The large ones are like lids, the medium ones like basins, and the small ones like cups. Motion in stillness, there is a sprinkler and the turtles can swim freely, without being aware of their confines. There is a small room on the pond, with one servant, whose duty is to care for the turtles. He always prepares water spinach for visitors to buy and feed the turtles. When the food drops, the turtles compete to eat. There is a natural and true pleasure. The two ponds above are full of vermilion hornshells, sometimes submerged, sometimes visible, carefree and contented. Also following the mountain stone slope forward, there is a corridor about half a mile long, winding through the towering rocks, extending to the top of the upper pool. There are rocks that stand tall, others lie like cattle, others seem drunk and about to fall asleep, as though the ridge has held an unblocked meeting, silence has something to say. Many visitors leave inscriptions on the rocks. On one stone is carved a brief history of the temple. The most noteworthy is the four characters "Never Forget the Motherland" by Kang Youwei, to the upper right. The meaning is quite profound. It seems that he knew of today's calamity. Our motherland is in danger and should be saved. Donate money, respond to recruitment, all these thoughts should not be forgotten. These words will remain on the stone, coexisting with heaven and earth, engraved between the evening drum and the morning bell. It has the deep meaning of awakening us. Continuing forward a few dozen steps, one enters the Gate of Liberation, which can suddenly free oneself of the worldly thoughts accumulated in one's heart. Then one enters the Gate of Orchid and Tea, which is the Zen gate. I once recalled a poem: "Looking east to Anren Village, looking west to Ziyun Pavilion, howling for smoke and mist, stepping high to seek orchid and tea". Reaching this point, visitors will know that Kek Lok Si Temple is the only Buddhist temple in Nanyang. Entering another gate, it opens up again. The Four Heavenly Kings are enshrined on the side. On both sides of the courtyard, there are seats arranged for men and women to sit separately. The tables and chairs are clean, the heat fades, and coolness arises. Sitting in the seats, a guest monk will come out to greet you, offering peanuts, fruit, and tea. Fried noodles and vegetarian dishes can also quench one's thirst and hunger. After a short while, the abbot or the head monk will come, cordially greeting and asking about your travels, discussing the scriptures, and forming a friendship outside the world. All emotions and obstacles are washed away, as if ascending to the heaven of desirelessness, living in a state of freedom. The monks of the temple are pure and self-sustaining, not seeking alms but relying on their own efforts. If they did not have innate karmic roots, how could they reach this state? If a visitor can become a major benefactor, his or her name will also be perpetuated. Following the steps up to the main hall, the Buddha is enshrined in the center, surrounded by nine hundred arhats, with lifelike appearances. From the transverse door on the left, one can go to the back of the hall. Taking the spiral staircase up to the Sutra Library, there are many scriptures stored in the cabinets. In front of the library is the moon platform. Looking up, it is as if one is in the Tushita Heaven. Looking down, the coconut and rubber trees form a dense canopy, representing the Saha world. The ocean spreads out far and wide. The clouds and trees are vast and hazy. The whole of Penang is in sight. Can it be said that one can put Mount Sumeru in a mustard seed? Inside the library, there is also a niche, enshrining more than twenty statues, all wearing Qing Dynasty robes and hats. Their eyebrows seem to move. Who are they? It is said that they were the major benefactors who donated tens of thousands of yuan during the construction of the temple. There is also a hall below, enshrining more than two hundred wooden tablets, also for the benefactors who donated hundreds of yuan. On the side of the hall, there are also several buildings, all enshrining Buddhas. Footprints are quite rare. It is indeed the most peaceful place. The temple winds around the mountain, forming more than a hundred monks' rooms and half an acre of gardens. The monks in the Golden Fish Pond each have their own fixed places. They eat together, and attend evening classes. Two halls of Xiangji, usually carry, only at meal times, the monks wearing robes and carrying equipment, circling the main hall, chanting Sanskrit while walking, bells and chimes ringing together, and after the classes, they all drink thin porridge, and each return to their chambers to self-cultivate, so they rarely see the face of a monk. The temple faces east, where one can see the sunrise in the clear morning, with mountains all around, one can also hear the sound of the Kalavinka in the middle of the night before one sleeps. Twenty years ago, the temple once attached schools to the side, opening a few months without gaining the Zen principle of teaching, so the temple is still pristine, and our overseas Chinese have such a great construction. So I wrote this grass for the purposes of introduction, and tourist recommendation.

### Questions and Answers

Reply to Mr. Huang Xiuzhen of Hunan and Guangzhou

Question: I heard that returning to Binzhou can be done by going through Guangzhou Bay and the Guangxi-Guizhou Road directly to Binzhou. Is this correct?

Answer: The section of highway from Guangzhou Bay to Yulin is currently impassable. You can go through Haiphong and Hanoi, then to Zhennanguan, then transfer to the Guangxi Provincial Highway bus to Datang, and then transfer to the Southwest Highway bus from Datang to Hengyang. From Hengyang, take the highway to Binzhou. This journey will take a long time, and the vehicles from Hengyang to Binzhou are scarce, so it may be impossible to reach.

### Shipping News Special

The Hairun of the Duolichen Ocean Company arrived in Hong Kong yesterday morning from Haikou. It was originally scheduled to depart for Shantou, Xiamen, and other places this afternoon, but due to a slight malfunction in the machinery, it must enter the dock for repairs. It is expected to continue sailing in about ten days.

The Himalaja of the Italian Postal Ship Company arrived in Hong Kong this morning from Europe via Shizhu, Saigon, and other ports, and moored at berth A-12 off Yau Ma Tei. It was found that the ship was carrying about 2,000 tons of cargo, mainly foreign paper and Saigon rice. It is reported that after the cargo is unloaded, it will sail to Shanghai, Japan, and other places.

The Yuansheng of the Jardine Shipping Company came to Hong Kong from Singapore. It was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday, but according to the company's news, the ship will be delayed until the 11th before it can arrive in Hong Kong. The date of departure for Japan has also been changed.

### Brief Summary of Common European and American Etiquette

Chinese and foreign etiquette differ, and customs are even more dissimilar. When often getting along with foreigners and engaging in social activities, if you want to be among the civilized and become a modern person, in addition to upholding our country's inherent etiquette, you must also know a little about international customs, so that you will not lose your composure in social situations and can also conform to the new life promoted by our country. A few points are excerpted below for reference:

(1) Public Places and Ships

What Europeans and Americans value most in public places or on ships, but what we often neglect, is the matter of taking off hats. Whenever you enter a guest hall, dining room, or auditorium, you should hold your hat in your hand. You must take off your hat to show respect when facing the national flag or singing the national anthem. If you meet an acquaintance woman, you should also take off your hat as a courtesy. If you are in an elevator, you should do the same to women regardless of whether you know them or not.

In the reading room, you must read quietly and not talk loudly to avoid disturbing your neighbors.

(2) Dining Room

When entering the seat, you must wait for the steward's guidance to arrange the position. When sitting, you must enter from the left. When encountering women, children, or the elderly, you should let them sit first.

When dressed in the dining room, one must be tidy, not bare-chested, not wear slippers, and not discard cigarette ashes arbitrarily, not spit on the floor, (use a handkerchief to spit, because the handkerchief is easy to wash)

Your own actions should be especially noticed, so as not to make people feel uncomfortable, such as shouting loudly, scratching your head, picking your nose, belching, shaking your legs, and placing your arms horizontally on the table, or putting them on the back of the neighboring seat, etc., bad habits are very easy to cause the aversion of others, which is not in accordance with polite behavior,

When eating, first spread the napkin on your lap. When eating, be calm. When drinking soup and chewing, avoid making any noise. Do not make any noise when the spoon or knife hits the plate. When you have finished eating, place the knife and fork together in the dish. This is a sign that you have finished eating. The waiter will understand this and will remove the leftover plate. The napkin on your lap is only for wiping your mouth and hands, and should not be used as a towel. When spitting bones or dregs, or picking your teeth, you must cover your mouth with your hand to avoid making people feel disgusted.

(3) Cabin

The opening and closing of doors should be done gently to avoid disturbing others.

After 10 p.m. and before 6 a.m., it is especially inappropriate to make noise to avoid disturbing people's dreams.

Whenever you go to a guest's cabin or walk down the corridor for any reason, you must be neatly dressed. This is a kind of public code on the ship, and it is also one of the aspects of implementing the new life etiquette in our country.

Economic Column

### This Year's Hong Kong Stock Market Situation: Although Affected by the Situation, Prices Increased Significantly

Over the past year, Hong Kong has been affected by the dual impact of the Far East War and the unrest in Europe, but the stock market has remained stable and prices have remained above par. Due to the instability of world politics, stocks have generally declined, but comparing the prices of various stocks at the beginning and end of last year, the daily prices actually rose. In January of last year, people were generally terrified by the Japanese army's invasion of the South, so the stock market was once depressed and various commercial activities were restricted. However, few investors sold their holdings, indicating that prices were relatively stable at that time. In the first three months of the year, dividends were increased, so buyers flocked to the market, and prices soared in March. However, investors were unwilling to sell. By early June, rumors of the Japanese army advancing south resurfaced, and as a result, the market became sluggish. Buyers observed the situation at the time and remained on the sidelines, and market prices fell slightly. However, investors did not feel compelled to sell. Soon the situation turned around, and by the end of June, market prices were stable and did not rise, but the market's appetite was extremely strong, which was nothing less than a manifestation of a preference for cash. By mid-September, due to the tense situation in Europe, Hong Kong's commercial activities were extremely bleak, and all markets were on the verge of collapse. Stocks could not escape the adverse environment, but fortunately, this unfavorable situation quickly dissipated in a short period of time. As the war spread to South China, the stock market once again became unstable and prices plummeted. Although investors sold their holdings, there was no sense of panic, but rather a reaction to nervous tension. When Guangzhou and Hankou fell, the stock market suddenly became bleak and trading was very thin. It was not until early December that it showed signs of recovery, with buyers gradually increasing and competing to offer high prices. Investors were also reluctant to sell, so the market supply and demand were imbalanced. Therefore, people are generally optimistic about this year's stock market.

### The History of Chinese Commerce: A Heartbreaking Tale (Continued) - No Foothold for Chinese Merchants in the Northeast

In the Northeast under Japanese rule, anyone wishing to engage in business must obtain permission from the Japanese. Those with little capital are not allowed, nor are those with too much. Those with incomplete equipment are not allowed, nor are those with complete equipment. If there is Japanese capital involved, a "permit" can be obtained. In addition, there are nineteen so-called "important industries" subject to even stricter regulations. However, artisans are an exception, as rights holders can only engage in handicrafts permanently. In May of last year, the so-called "National Government" promulgated the so-called "Production Control Law," which further restricted everything. Chinese merchants naturally have no foothold there. Looking at the survey conducted by the Dalian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as of December 31 of last year, there were a total of 3,189 companies in Manchuria, of which 2,730 were Japanese-owned, accounting for more than 85%. Chinese-owned companies numbered only 459, accounting for less than 15%. The total capital was 2.54 billion yuan, of which Japanese capital accounted for 67%, while Chinese capital accounted for 33%. It can be seen that Chinese merchants have to merge with each other to raise capital in order to be allowed to establish businesses. Therefore, the average capital of Japanese companies is large, but even if the average capital of each Japanese company is not as large as that of Chinese companies, they are still allowed to establish businesses. How miserable is the life of people in the lost territories?

### Thanks to the [Censored]! Hong Kong's Red Pills Increasingly Potent. Red Pill Manufacturing Organizations Mostly Run by [Censored]. Hong Kong Government Determined to Eradicate the Problem

Although the history of red pills in Hong Kong is short, its harm is enough to shock people. In the past year or two, the trafficking of red pills in Hong Kong has become extremely common. Sales and consumption dens have sprung up in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon. These secret organizations have been increasing day by day like bamboo shoots after the rain, and the number of red pill addicts in Hong Kong has also increased. The government authorities have long paid close attention to the scourge of red pills and have ordered both the customs and police agencies to clear out red pill smugglers. However, the smugglers of red pills are full of tricks. Despite the strict arrests, they continue to smuggle them in, and the trafficking of red pills in Hong Kong cannot be eradicated. It is truly heartbreaking.

Numerous Dens, Many Addicts

It is difficult to make an accurate estimate of the number of secret organizations selling red pills in Hong Kong, but the figure is indeed shocking. According to British Labour Party MP Mr. Fletcher, in his address to the House of Commons questioning the ban on red pills in Hong Kong, he pointed out that there were at least three hundred red pill dens in Hong Kong, with 40,000 red pill addicts, and that the entire Hong Kong consumed about 30 million red pills every day. The MP presented this shocking figure to prove that Hong Kong was unable to ban the trafficking of red pills. However, the Hong Kong government is not unconcerned about eradicating the scourge of red pills. Even the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffrey Northcote, raised the issue of red pills in Hong Kong at the Legislative Council budget meeting, saying that the scourge of red pills in Hong Kong was thanks to the [Censored] and was a major disaster for society. The government must take strict steps, but the public must also cooperate in reporting and publicizing the issue, so that the movement to eradicate red pills can succeed.

Anti-Drug Association Temporarily Suspends Work

Years ago, Hong Kong's social elites, in response to the government's anti-red pill movement, established the Anti-Drug Promotion Association to widely publicize anti-drug messages and assist the government in carrying out the movement to eradicate the scourge of red pills. However, the association suspended its work last year. The person in charge of the association said that it was temporarily suspended due to the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the opinion of the general public, the temporary suspension of the association is regrettable. The scourge of red pills is so great, and countless young people have gone from "trying it out" to "becoming addicted." If it is not banned as soon as possible, the future of Hong Kong society will be unimaginable. Moreover, red pill manufacturing organizations are mostly run by [Censored], and unscrupulous villains act as accomplices, operating the business and harming the overseas Chinese. Therefore, overseas Chinese should wake up and carry out the anti-drug movement.

Cunning Smugglers, Difficult to Arrest

In the past, red pills were manufactured in Hong Kong, mostly by [Censored] who smuggled heroin from abroad and then manufactured red pills. However, in recent years, the Hong Kong customs authorities have cracked down too harshly and broken up many red pill manufacturing organizations. The villains who manufacture red pills dare not manufacture them in Hong Kong anymore and have moved out of Hong Kong. Currently, the red pills sold in Hong Kong are all smuggled in from abroad, mostly from the occupied areas. Because the smuggling methods are extremely clever, even though customs officers are careful in searching, they cannot crack down on all of them. Therefore, red pill dens in Hong Kong still have a supply of red pills. However, because the crackdown is very strict, smuggling is not as easy as before, and the source of red pills has been hit.

Strict Punishment to Eradicate the Problem

The government authorities have recently made a great determination to order both the customs and police bureaus to strictly arrest smugglers and eradicate the scourge of drugs. In recent days, many smuggling operations and red pill dens have been cracked down on, and sellers of red pills are generally wary. In addition to ordering strict crackdowns, the government authorities are also determined to severely punish red pill offenders. After the red pill dens are cracked down on, the owners will not only be sentenced to imprisonment, but will also be deported after serving their sentences. Smugglers of red pills will also be punished in the same way. As for the owners or tenants of the premises or rooms where the red pill dens are cracked down on, they will also be punished for harboring criminals, with a fine of $2,500 and twelve months of hard labor. If they are unable to pay the fine, they will be sentenced to an additional six months of hard labor, for a total of eighteen months. The government is actively working to eradicate the scourge of drugs, and it is hoped that members of society will cooperate earnestly so that this social scourge can be eliminated.

### Economic Expert Talks About Increasing Taxes, Suggests Levying Business License Fees and Increasing Funding for Charity and Education

The Hong Kong authorities, in order to increase fiscal revenue, have established a Tax Rules Research Committee. The members of the committee are all current officials and fiscal experts. The general Hong Kong people believe that various commercial activities in Hong Kong today are prosperous, and the population has increased from 900,000 to over one million. Therefore, the fiscal revenue will naturally increase without the need for further research. Therefore, some people are puzzled and do not quite understand. Therefore, the reporter specially consulted an economic expert to inquire about the situation. According to the economic expert, Hong Kong is a tax-free port with annual expenditures of over 30 million and annual revenues of over 30 million. The surplus is not very large. Currently, in order to increase administrative expenses, the authorities have to seek to increase fiscal revenue. The authorities have now established a Tax Rules Research Committee to explore new sources of tax revenue. Someone has submitted a letter to a Western newspaper, suggesting that the authorities nationalize various cross-harbor ferries and long-distance bus and tram transportation industries in order to increase tax revenue. If this measure is implemented, it will certainly increase tax revenue. However, in my personal opinion (the economic expert), it would be better to levy business license fees. In Hong Kong, peddlers must obtain a license, but large and small commercial stores and office buildings, with annual incomes ranging from several thousands to several millions, do not have to pay license fees. This is unfair compared to peddlers. Moreover, this levy is practiced in other countries. Recently, the Guangzhou Municipal Government also had this levy, which was differentiated according to the registered capital and industry. In this way, the amount must be considerable. However, Hong Kong's current charitable expenditure budget is $214,774, and the education expenditure is $2,276,736. With a population of over one million in Hong Kong, charitable expenses are only over 200,000. There should be a substantial increase in order to run various charitable undertakings. The most urgent need is to provide relief to disaster victims and care for orphans. As for the expenditure on education, although the amount is over 2 million yuan, it includes educational administrative expenses. If the subsidies are subsidized, the amount is very small. Although various overseas Chinese guilds in Hong Kong have established charitable schools, they often face financial difficulties, leading to incomplete management. The government should pay attention to this and increase tuition fees in official schools in order to reduce the burden on students.

### Ships from Shanghai, Xiamen, Shantou, Macau and Other Places Must Enter Quarantine. Six Provinces and Cities Considered Contagious Ports. Hong Kong Ships Going to the US, Shantou, Xiamen, etc. Also Required.

Hong Kong has a constant outbreak of seasonal diseases, so the health authorities are paying close attention to prevention matters. On the one hand, they are also afraid that seasonal diseases will be transmitted to Hong Kong from other places, so many nearby ports have been designated as contagious ports by Hong Kong. Ships coming from these places must enter quarantine. According to the announcement by Secretary for Chinese Affairs, Mr. Smith, on the 6th of this month, they are as follows: Bangkok (plague, a type of fever), Xiamen (cholera), Shantou, Macau (cholera), Guangzhou (cholera), Fuzhou (cholera), Shanghai (smallpox). There are also many places nearby that have declared Hong Kong as a contagious port, including the United States and the Hawaiian Islands, the Philippines, Binh Goc, Xiamen, Taiwan, Shantou, Yantai, the Dutch East Indies, Tianjin, and the Haijiao colony of Sarawik. All Hong Kong ships going to the above-mentioned places must also be quarantined upon arrival.

### "司路化司打輪" (Si Lu Hua Si Da Lun), All Shanghai Sailors Suddenly Resign. 28 Return to Singapore for Unknown Reasons

[Special report from this newspaper] "司路化司打" (Si Lu Hua Si Da), the agent of Taiziyang Line in Hong Kong, arrived in Hong Kong on the evening of the 4th of this month, carrying thousands of tons of goods, which have now been completely unloaded. The ship was driven into the Wan Lung Shipyard in Kowloon yesterday. According to the reporter, the 28 Shanghai sailors currently on board suddenly resigned yesterday morning. Taking advantage of the Taikoo liner Anshun's return to Singapore at 6:00 yesterday morning. It was found that after the crew members left, they were succeeded by [censored] employees represented by [censored]. The reason for the departure has not been ascertained. It was also found that the ship was the first time to arrive in Hong Kong and will sail to Yilu on the 17th of this month.

### Restriction on Refugees Coming to Hong Kong Suddenly Becomes Strict Recently. Women Coming from Macau Must Also Pay $20. It is Rumored that the Amount Will Be Increased to $50 per Person

The Hong Kong Police Authority, because there are too many refugees coming to Hong Kong, is afraid that the relief work will increase difficulties. It has specially promulgated a new rule that all passengers coming to Hong Kong from [censored], whether they are refugees or not, must show HK$20 in cash before they are allowed to land. The ordinance has been in effect for several months now and is still being implemented. At the beginning of the promulgation of the new rule, the scope was only limited to men, and women were not included in the restrictions.

The Scope of Restriction Also Includes Women

At the beginning of the implementation of the restriction measures, the inspection of passengers coming to Hong Kong was quite strict. Along Connaught Road, large teams of Chinese and Western police officers were dispatched to each Hong Kong-Macau pier. Those who did not carry $20 in cash were all taken back to the police station and sent back out of the country. Later, as the war gradually subsided and fewer refugees came to Hong Kong, the authorities also relaxed the inspection measures slightly. Passengers whose clothes were slightly more complete and did not look like refugees could be released at any time without the need for detailed questioning, which greatly facilitated travelers. However, recently the authorities have changed the measures, and the scope of the restrictions now includes women. Women coming to Hong Kong these days, from the 1st of this month, must also have cash guarantees, and the inspection of male passengers is also more rigorous than before. The reason for this is unknown, but according to the speculation of the general public, it may be due to the rapid increase in the population of Hong Kong and the shortage of buildings, making the current panic problem extremely difficult to solve. Even those who have assets to come to Hong Kong still have no place to live, and those who come to Hong Kong without housing often sleep on the streets, so the number of people sleeping under the arcade at night has suddenly increased. The reason why the authorities are restricting people from other places from coming to Hong Kong may be due to this. Also, in the past, during the implementation of the $20 cash guarantee period, most of the refugees who came to Hong Kong were alone, intending to rely on friends and relatives upon arrival. Even those who carried cash did not have enough for the $20. Therefore, when landing, they were worried that they would violate the new rule and be detained and deported.

Taking the Opportunity to Profit, Suspected of Renting Cash

At this time, people on board who saw an opportunity to profit from the situation were not uncommon. Their method was that when the ship was about to arrive in Hong Kong, someone would shout "Western paper for rent" to solicit business. To rent $20 worth of Western paper, a passenger would have to pay an interest of two or three yuan in Hong Kong dollars, or at least one yuan. After the passengers landed with the cash and passed the police inspection, they had to return the $20 Hong Kong dollars and pay the interest. This method has been in effect for several months, and many operators have made profits. Those who lend money can earn such interest in a single gesture, and passengers who do not have cash can pay a small fee to avoid police questioning and the difficulty of detention and deportation. It is truly a win-win situation. However, recently there have been cunning people who have taken the opportunity to cheat. They pretend to be refugees, borrow money to get through the difficult situation, and are willing to pay more interest. However, as soon as they land, they run away, and the $20 is gone. As a result, those who speculate on lending money have suffered great losses. Therefore, when lending money to these people, they must be extremely cautious and only lend to those who have luggage, which is also an interesting episode in the restriction of passengers entering Hong Kong.

### Mobilizing Over 10,000 Machinists in Hong Kong to Participate in the One-Dollar Movement. The Union Held a Meeting of Ten Branch Leaders Yesterday. Over 200 Members Were Elected at the Meeting.

After the General Chamber of Commerce advocated the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement, various overseas Chinese organizations responded enthusiastically. The Hong Kong Chinese Machine Association, as a leading organization in the working class, has made significant contributions in previous charity donations. This time, they also expressed their enthusiastic support for the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement. Chairman Han Wenhuan specially convened a meeting of ten branch leaders of the machine industry in Hong Kong at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss the mobilization plan. Those who attended the meeting included Chairman Han Wenhuan, Yang Yaoting, Li Xiang, Li Duxiu, Tan Nan, Zi Zhan, He Zhang, Huang Wangpei, Huang Wo, Man, and Tian Zhaokun, among others, totaling over a hundred people. The situation was very lively. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Han Wenhui gave an opening speech, saying that after the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement was launched by compatriots in Shanghai and other places, the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and others have already responded. Although we are workers, we must do our best as citizens and hold this event. After Han finished his speech, the leaders of each branch gave their opinions. As a result, everyone unanimously agreed to continue discussing the implementation plan. The attending leaders believed that there were over 10,000 machinists in Hong Kong. If the organization was not strict, it would be difficult to promote the movement widely. Therefore, it was decided to break with all previous fundraising methods, expand the number of people to be mobilized, and take the factory as a unit for larger factories in Hong Kong, and the team leader as a unit for larger factories, so as to ensure that everyone participates. Over 200 collection committee members were elected on the spot to take on the work. The executive committees of the association also each elected three responsible members to serve as standing committee members and take turns to be on duty at the association every day to coordinate the work of all parties. In addition, the Chaozhou Bayi Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a meeting this afternoon to discuss the implementation plan. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Association will hold a meeting tomorrow evening to implement the plan. The Christian Federation Relief Committee will also hold a meeting during the day to mobilize all Christians to participate in the One-Dollar Debt Repayment Movement.

### Tang Sai Ge Ji (Singer of Tang Sai) To Have 6th Charity Performance on the 21st

The funds raised this time will be allocated to the China Youth Rescue Hong Kong Group for the relief of war refugees. The various arrangements have been completed through consultations between the person in charge of the group and the five singers from Tang Sai, including Tuantuan Bao, Yu Nv, Meili Li, Hua Yinghen, and Genu. The rescue team, in recognition of the singers' enthusiastic patriotism, has prepared various valuable prizes to award to the participating singers to encourage them. The group will also be led by the fourth team leader, Kuang Dezhi, and members of each team will sell flowers indoors to raise a large amount of charitable donations.

### St. Paul's College to Hold Fundraising Entertainment Event. Xue Juexian and Others to Perform for Free

The performances at the event are rich and exquisite. Those who will participate in the performance include Liao Xiahuai, Shanghai Mei, Bai Ju Rong, Tang Xueqing, and Li Qinian.

### Guangdong Chairman Li Hanhun Concerned About Hong Kong Refugees. Telegram to the Hong Kong News Reporters Association Requesting Investigation of the Situation to Facilitate Relief Efforts

Since taking office as Chairman of Guangdong Province, Li Hanhun has been on duty. Chairman Li is concerned about the large number of residents from the mainland who have been displaced to Hong Kong due to the war in South China. He has written to this newspaper, the News Reporters Association, to ask for an investigation of the situation in order to facilitate relief efforts. The Reporters Association has already sent a telegram back to Chairman Li. The original text of the two telegrams is recorded below.

Chairman Li: To the Hong Kong Chinese News Reporters Association,

It is heard that there are many refugees in Hong Kong, and charitable organizations and overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, with the assistance of the Hong Kong government, are helping to accommodate them. Their enthusiasm for righteousness is admirable. Disaster relief is a responsibility we all share. Because of the national disaster, they are displaced, and they do not complain about the hardships. I am living in a foreign land, and it is even more unbearable to think of them in the severe winter, cold and hungry. I am now in charge of the province, and every time I think of it, I am moved to tears. Therefore, I am sending a telegram to ask you to investigate the situation of the refugees in Hong Kong in detail and send me a telegram so that I can find a way to provide relief. I am grateful and pray with you.

Li Hanhun (4th)

Reporters Association Telegram

To Chairman Li of the Lianxian Provincial Government:

I have received your telegram, and I am deeply moved by your concern for the refugees. We are already investigating the situation in detail from all parties. We will reply to you in detail as soon as the investigation is completed.

The Hong Kong Reporters Association (7th)

### Relief Association for the Homeless

— Mada

In this contradictory society of "Behind the red doors, meat rots; on the road, there are those who die of starvation," on one hand, there are high-rise mansions where people refuse to eat anything but the finest delicacies, cannot sit comfortably on anything but elastic sofas, travel in streamlined cars, and spend their days surrounded by women, frequenting theaters and dance halls. On the other hand, there are the toiling masses who struggle all day long but cannot even get a full meal, and who cannot get a peaceful night's sleep. Especially after the Japanese invasion, residents from the surrounding villages fled to Hong Kong in droves. Given that demand far exceeded supply for housing in Hong Kong, the profit-minded landlords evicted existing tenants to rent to new, wealthier tenants, seeking even higher rents. As a result, recently in both Hong Kong and Kowloon, when night falls, every road is filled with fellow Chinese refugees, forced out by landlords and homeless, sleeping under the eaves. Whole families huddle together in a corner. In this bitter and cold night, the hardship is something that those who sleep under warm quilts and blankets, accompanied by a rosy-cheeked girl, can never truly understand. Yesterday, we already published a feature article on "Street Sleepers." What I want to talk about now is the situation of the relief association for these street sleepers.

The Relief Association for the Homeless is meant to provide temporary shelter to these homeless people. Everyone understands that this is not a fundamental solution. However, in the absence of a better solution, it is a temporary measure to alleviate the contradictions and severity of this crisis-ridden society. It is better than nothing. A fundamental solution awaits social reform!

The Relief Association for the Homeless begins sheltering the homeless public every December. The addresses are divided into three locations: "Next to the No. 7 Police Station in Sai Wan," which can accommodate over a hundred people; one in the Yaumatei Oil Depot, which can accommodate four hundred people; and one in the Old Victoria Barracks, which can accommodate over three hundred people. Every evening around 7 p.m., many disheveled coolies from the docks, street vendors, and impoverished compatriots, men and women, old and young, stand in line, waiting like a long snake to register for lodging. The registration procedure is extremely simple. Regardless of gender or age, no fee is charged. Following the order of the line, they fill out their name, place of origin, and occupation. After receiving a numbered tag, a soldier takes you to your assigned bunk bed. Each person receives three hemp mats, a towel, and a piece of soap. They go to the washroom to clean themselves, and then a doctor examines them for diseases. Afterward, they can get a good night's sleep. Every morning, clean-up staff, supervised by a cleaning assistant, use disinfectant to wash each bunk bed. Every week, all the bedding is disinfected with sulfur. The doors open at 6 a.m. every morning and close at 9 a.m. After closing, no one is allowed to enter or exit freely. Every night, young women take turns managing hygiene here. The funding comes partly from allocations from the Hong Kong government and partly from donations from enthusiastic members of the public.

Although there are no warm blankets, soft quilts, or elastic "sofa" beds here, the "authentic" cold-resistant mountain blankets—hemp mats—and wooden bunk beds are better than huddling under the eaves. However, there is a limited capacity here. Every night, so many people seek lodging that there is news of full capacity almost every day. Especially during these days of sudden cold weather, one truly feels the sentiment of "How can one obtain vast houses, thousands and millions of rooms, to shelter all the world's poor and make them smile!"

Every time the dawn light appears and the clock on the wall chimes six times, they get up one after another, do a simple grooming, and quickly rush to the docks or streets to sell their labor. After dusk, they come again!

This group of people, in the past, were undoubtedly productive members of the rural areas. They could not bear the various exploitations and oppressions in their hometowns, as well as the recent bombings and massacres by the Japanese. Helplessly, they abandoned their hometowns and homes, dreaming of a golden future, traveling thousands of miles to make a living. They never dreamed that such a thing would happen before the disaster struck!

### Promoting Proper Leisure Activities: A Record of the Inaugural Meeting of the Amateur Friendship Society

— Qizhuo

From Dissoluteness to Solemnity, from Individual to Collective

Humans are energetic, especially young people, whose vitality is even more vigorous. If this vitality does not develop in a positive direction, it will be released in a negative direction. It will never remain latent or stagnant.

Living in a bustling city, stimuli and temptations are sharp and intense. If one's subjective strength is not strong enough, it is easy to squander precious life force on improper activities and gradually decline. The sins of the city are something we deeply regret.

The Hong Kong Amateur Friendship Society is a brand new organization that promotes proper leisure activities. From this pure motive, perhaps new seeds will be sown in Hong Kong, and the dissolute atmosphere will change to a solemn one. While celebrating, we also place infinite hope in it.

The Amateur Friendship Society has over 170 members, mostly mainland employees from banks, companies, and foreign firms. They have been active for several months. Until recently, they completed the registration procedures with the Hong Kong government. Yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m., they officially held their inaugural meeting at the Confucius Hall. Hearing the news, the reporter also went to observe with a feeling of excitement and joy.

Greeters at the door distributed the society's inaugural special issue. Upon entering the hall, one could immediately sense the lively and harmonious atmosphere.

The majestic national flag unveiled the prelude to this grand event. After the rituals were completed, Chairman Yu Junheng delivered an enthusiastic opening speech: "After we, this group of outsiders, were driven to Hong Kong by the flames of the 'August 13th' Incident, we realized that if we were not careful, we would degenerate in this society. To avoid wasting time and to engage in activities beneficial to society and the country, we organized this society. The process of organizing this society was quite strenuous, but our courage to overcome difficulties has only grown stronger.

What excites us the most is that our plan for soliciting books was originally for 3,000 volumes, but unexpectedly, we received over 10,000 volumes. We are very grateful to all sectors and elders for their encouragement and assistance in spirit and material.

Our hopes are: First, we hope that more colleagues in Hong Kong will actively participate in our society. Second, we hope that all sectors will provide more guidance and help to our society."

Next, Zhang Mianzhi reported on the preparations. The gist was: "This society initially evolved from a seminar. Due to environmental factors and the difficulty of finding a venue, it was delayed until today to be established. Regarding the work done in the past, the General Affairs Department handled administrative matters. The Friendship Department held tea parties and social gatherings once a month, as well as an outdoor trip. The Academic Department organized a library and a drama troupe, performing patriotic dramas. We hold current affairs seminars, lectures by celebrities, and painting appreciation sessions every week. The small publication 'Amateur' has been published for two issues. We also actively promote sports training, focusing on health. At the same time, we contribute the strength of our group to the nation. Last year, during the 'July 7th' and 'August 13th' incidents, we enthusiastically raised funds. During the 'September 18th' incident, we collected winter clothing. Recently, we have been promoting the one-dollar debt repayment campaign…"

From this speech, one can see that the society is a rigorous yet vibrant new organization. We hope that all professional youth in Hong Kong can lead a similar group life, growing up with the new era.

Guest speakers included Cheng Shewo, Wu Hanzhen, and Hu Yue. Mr. Tao Xingzhi was unable to attend due to obstacles.

After the speeches by each guest, the chairman provided brief supplementary remarks, which effectively enlivened the atmosphere of the meeting.

To put the speeches of the chairman and Mr. Wu Hanzhen into practice, a one-dollar debt repayment campaign was held on the spot. Anyone who had not participated in this campaign was asked to donate freely. Solicitors went around to collect donations, raising a total of HK$43.42 and CN¥2. The amount is secondary; it is essential that everyone understands the significance of this campaign.

Next was the awards ceremony for the amateur library book donation campaign, presented by Mr. Wu Hanzhen. A round of applause accompanied the recipients as they hurried to the stage, their faces flushed, to receive their certificates and medals.

During the passage of the charter and the election of directors, some guests and members became impatient.

When the choir began singing, the meeting became lively again.

Among the twenty-plus members of the choir, some wore long gowns, some wore suits, some wore Zhongshan suits, and some wore sportswear. Young and old, each had their own expression, eliciting laughter from the audience. Especially the chubby "long-gown clown type" on the left and the perpetually unsmiling "suit-wearing white face" elder on the right drew even more laughter.

Several patriotic songs were sung in a row, all very powerful. The twenty-plus male and female choir members from the Commercial Press also participated in the singing, which was very moving, especially "Fight Back to the Northeast" and "Defend Our Homeland." When they finished singing several patriotic songs, the audience cheered loudly: "Bravo—encore—encore—" Here, one could fully see the power of music.

After the instrumental performance, the drama "The Song of the Skin" was performed. The dialogue, like the entire meeting, was entirely in Mandarin. The setting and technique were very moving to the audience. The end of the play saw the transformation of the police officer who had been a lackey of the enemy. The patriotic youth led everyone to a safe area to engage in guerrilla warfare, ending the meeting with shouts of "Let's all go fight guerrillas together!"

### Promoting Theater Movement, Raising Funds for Refugees! The Era Theater Troupe Will Perform in Macau Today, Cultural Circles in Macau Prepare a Warm Welcome

Special Report from Our Newspaper—The Era Theater Troupe is the most modern drama group in Hong Kong. Based on its hard-working spirit, it has achieved remarkable results in the past. Since obtaining the renowned playwright Ouyang Yuqian as director recently, it has shown even more vigorous vitality. It is reported that the troupe, to promote the Macau drama movement and patriotic propaganda, will specifically depart for Macau today for five days, starting tomorrow (the 1st), to perform the national defense dramas "Night Light Cup," "The Eve," "The Devil's Cave," "Thunderstorm," and "The Paint is Dry" at the Victoria Theatre. The performances on the first two nights will raise funds for the Hong Kong Student Relief Committee to serve refugees from the Xijiang River area. In addition to patriotic propaganda, it will also perform relief work, which has particularly significant effects. It is expected to have a good impact on the culturally backward Macau. It is reported that local cultural organizations have prepared a warm welcome. It is also reported that the manager of the troupe, Li Huajun, has already resigned.

### Literature to the Countryside and Folk Literature

— He Hua'an

From the second volume, fifth issue of "Literary Front," Ding Ming's article "A Cultural Tour of the Interior" provides information on the cultural poverty and the popularity of martial arts stories in the interior, and so on. This makes us think of the issue of bringing literature to the countryside.

Previously, many friends had intense debates about the issue of "literature to the countryside." Some even proposed the use of romanization as a tool for bringing literature to the countryside. However, from Mr. Ding Ming's article, we believe that cultural workers going to the countryside is also an urgent need for educating the people at present. If cultural workers do not go to the interior, do not go to the countryside, then even if the romanization of the national language is a perfect movement, it will not achieve effective results.

We know that those who currently educate the farmers in the countryside are mostly old-fashioned private school teachers, and the influence of storytellers and fortune-tellers is very strong. For thousands of years, the traditional feudal thinking has deeply dominated the minds of most farmers through these martial arts romances in folk literature. Therefore, before the cultural poverty in the interior and the new romanized script can be effectively promoted, it does not seem superfluous to discuss folk literature as a topic for going to the countryside.

At present, most of the new literature—established after the May Fourth Movement—almost still circles within the intellectual class. The time when peasant literature fully appears in new literature has not yet arrived, so today—the literary works under the theme of the War of Resistance—have not yet won the love of the vast majority of farmers. For farmers, apart from their own songs (such as mountain songs, folk songs, etc.), popular martial arts romances, or novels such as Xue Rengui's Expedition to the East, Luo Bu Saving Her Mother, etc., are the works that farmers pass down by word of mouth.

Therefore, for the sake of literary works inspiring the awareness of the War of Resistance, for the sake of bringing literature to the countryside and educating the vast majority of farmers, etc., we believe that making considerable revisions to popular literary works may be a temporary solution.

I remember that previously, regarding the problem of the sword and fairy stories in the comic strip storybooks for children, some people advocated using woodcut comic strip books and adding fresh teaching materials to replace them, in order to remedy the shortcomings of these children's reading materials. Some also suggested revising folk literature and folk tales as reading materials for educating the public at present. However, like a gentle breeze, it blew over, and afterwards, these initiatives were never seen again. Last year, the Guangzhou-published National Salvation Daily published "Everyone Reads," which contained anti-war stories written in popular Cantonese. This was a good intention. Unfortunately, the readers of the "National Salvation Daily" were only intellectuals and a portion of the petty bourgeoisie. Because it itself, like general literary works, cannot go to the countryside at all!

At present, because of the mobilization of the vast majority of the people, under the theme of resistance and national construction, we cannot but appeal: we ask writers to put new wine into old bottles with folk literature and folk tales. Just like the Peking opera and Shanghai opera after the August 13th Incident, and like the anti-war drum ballad that Mr. Lao She is working hard on, appearing under the banner of the War of Resistance, take the new theme of anti-war consciousness in folk literature as a weapon for educating the vast majority of the people.

The author has only broadly raised the concrete reasons for this issue. We hope that this issue of "Literature to the Countryside and Folk Literature" will cause experts to conduct further theoretical exploration and implementation.

Let us also use Mr. Ding Ming's words as an example.

"Liuzhou is a very important place. However, the cultural level is too low, the cultural food is too lacking, and the literary movement is too quiet. From this place, we can see that the theory of literature to the countryside in the interior, which is even more remote than Liuzhou, has not yet become a guideline for practice. Comrades, please come to the interior to pioneer!"

However, for the sake of literature to the countryside and the education and mobilization of the people having a rapid development and effect, we even more hope that literary and art comrades will come to do this work of revising the folk literature lurking in the minds of the farmers, because some of these poisonous martial arts romances are filled with the poison of feudal thought, which is in line with the so-called Kingly Way. Therefore, as long as the reading materials of martial arts romances still exist, they will invisibly reduce many beliefs in the War of Resistance and the strength of the War of Resistance.

Since bringing literature to the countryside is an important topic at present, the revision of folk literature should also be no exception!

### On Yu Feng's "Rout"

— Zhu Baishui

Coincidentally, on December 27th and 28th of last year, the "Literary" section of the Ta Kung Pao and the "Free Talk" section of the Shen Pao both had reviews of the fifth issue of the second volume of "Literary Front." The former was written by Lin Huanping, and the latter was written by He Hua'an.

In these two reviews, they both commonly gave a very high evaluation of Yu Feng's "Rout." Originally, I had read this article early on. Because of this, I reread it again, and this further aroused many memories of friendship.

I remember, around mid-November of last year, a friend I hadn't seen for a long time suddenly came to find me. It was still early morning, and the coolness of the morning air made me shiver a little. However, no matter what, I couldn't stop the fervent beating of my heart. The scent of joy made my face flush a little.

I tightly grasped Yu Feng's hand. His clear laughter temporarily left us speechless.

After the fall of Guangzhou, the melancholy memories made it difficult for me to bear. The fate of friends was as illusory as smoke, but I never expected to quietly meet Yu Feng. He brought many comforting jokes and also dragged in much unfortunate news.

Ouyang Shan, Cao Ming (Editor's note: Mr. and Mrs. Ouyang Shan have now safely arrived in Yuanling, Hunan, and are temporarily residing at Jiang Muliang's place.), Xu Jiehe, Pu Feng, and a group of friends were then in a state of unknown life or death, but Yu Feng was lucky enough to cross the enemy's firing line and flee to Xiangdao.

Then, in a clear voice, he began to describe his escape process, especially the exposure of the chaos and disorder during the retreat, which made us feel sorry and indignant. But he didn't. He just shook his head calmly. He said that this kind of failed struggle was indeed inexplicable, but when he experienced it himself, he only felt that it was an inevitable process in the national liberation war. These weaknesses, these undeniable tragedies, could only be overcome through more fearful and more intense struggles to make progress.

That day, we talked a lot. Afterwards, he came many times, and in our conversations, he always tirelessly described the situation of this retreat from a war that had never even been fought.

"Haha, can you imagine? A soldier actually fell sound asleep in the midst of intense bombing and strafing..."

Yu Feng looked at me spiritedly, and I asked in surprise. He said calmly:

"In Hongcun, Zhuhushan, I met a Chief Officer Zhao from the Infantry Artillery Company. Once he told me that when they encountered a large number of Japanese planes flying low to drop bombs and strafe with machine guns, the roaring explosions made his head dizzy, and he unconsciously fell asleep in the muddy field, feeling unspeakably sweet..."

Haha!—We laughed loudly at each other, but this laughter was only bitter. A tragic failure evolved in this absurd and idiotic situation.

It turned out that what he said was all recorded in the first anecdote in the "Retreat" section of his "Rout."

He told me that he had written a very long article for Mr. Mao Dun, reporting on the process of this retreat from the Dongjiang with the "Military Service Group" without experiencing battle. Soon after, he visited me for the last time, saying that he was leaving and would embark on a new journey of struggle in the motherland, using a new fighting posture to make up for this shameful failure!

He went back to Jiangmen. But his face, with a bright smile and large glasses, has long been lingering in my memories of friendship.

When the fifth issue of the second volume of "Literary Front" was newly launched, I bought it and quietly finished reading Yu Feng's "Rout." Recalling his own accounts, the taste and emotions were naturally more intense than those of others.

In this report-style text, we can only calmly see a little about the experiences and trivial interesting sketches of a low-ranking combatant. However, from these many trivial experiences, we can think of the source of a tragic failure that cannot be forgiven, truly and tragically exposing the lack of political education and the incompetence of superior commanders. Originally, this should be full of indignation and pessimism. However, the author did not adopt this technique. The author expressed a more serious and severe truth through calmness and hilarity.

Just as Mr. Lin Huanping said that the author added two anecdotes to the "Garrison" and "Retreat" in order to prevent the description from becoming monotonous, which is fresh and lively. I agree with this meaning. These four anecdotes gave the full text of "Rout" a very important and good help, making the full text doubly fresh and lively, and it can also more deeply portray the postures of the characters in the turmoil and expose the ugliness buried in the dark.

Perhaps the author's itinerary limited the harvest of his observations. In "Rout," we can only see a one-sided description, and there is no more active or expanded concrete report on the overall exposure of the failure in this South China battle. This is a deficiency in "Rout."

At the same time, I always felt that Yu Feng lacked a certain function in "Rout." This function can be said to have failed to correctly indicate the weaknesses of this battle failure, and even more failed to use bright hope to lead us to look forward to the future battle new stage of this South China battlefield, which is enough to tie the people of China to the final victory.

In the progress of the national life-and-death struggle, our literature, in addition to the need for deep exposure and practical reporting, also needs correct guidance and correct criticism, so as to advance China's new literature to a richer state through correct guidance and criticism. This failure in the South China battle has inexcusable shortcomings in military and political terms. Therefore, we hope that a more concrete and more complete report will be reflected in literature. Yu Feng's future efforts are immeasurable, and all writers in South China should bear this important responsibility.

"Rout" has its shortcomings, and it also has its value of existence. Especially because of the serious failure in the early stages of the South China battlefield, we feel that this first relatively complete report is even more worthy of attention and precious.

### On the Banning of Hamlet

— Lao Nan

It is said that in Tokyo, cultural control has reached the point where even Shakespeare's tragedy, Hamlet, has been banned from performance. It is not surprising that fascist rule does not allow the growth of genuine literature and art, but it is somewhat surprising that a writer from the Elizabethan era, three hundred years ago, should also suffer as a result. If Shakespeare knew about this, he would surely have a feeling of not knowing whether to laugh or cry; this is indeed true.

Why ban Hamlet? When I saw this news, the answer that popped into my head was a helpless smile, because I thought it must be some simple-minded warlord who seized on the reason that Hamlet had "dangerous thoughts" and ordered it to be banned. But on further thought, things might not be that simple. So I began to think of some "possible" reasons for the ban.

Perhaps it was because Hamlet exposed the tormented psychology of the Japanese warlords? As they are deeply mired in the trenches of our country, unable to advance or retreat, and in a state of extreme anxiety and distress, Shakespeare's Hamlet, in a mocking tone, uses his most famous soliloquy to express the tormented psychology of the Japanese warlords: "To be, or not to be, that is the question."

For the Japanese warlords, this is clearly a question they are asking themselves. However, they will not have an answer.

Hamlet has one characteristic: although he has great ambitions, he lacks perseverance. This is an important component of Hamlet's tragedy. In the eyes of the Japanese warlords, perhaps this is another harsh satire on themselves. They have the ambition to destroy China, but unfortunately they do not have enough strength. As they are painfully aware of the "longing to destroy and enslave China, but lacking the strength," this kind of satire is really unbearable.

Furthermore, Hamlet has a character of deep deliberation. Before engaging in a major action, he wants to consider many aspects. This, of course, has a negative impact on the Japanese warlords' current policy of fooling the people. What the Japanese warlords want is for the people of the whole country to become thoughtless tools of aggression, only harboring the illusion of "conquering China," like cattle and horses with their eyes covered, deceived and manipulated by them. If the Japanese people, once influenced by Hamlet, also began to "think deeply," then the result would inevitably be to overthrow the Japanese warlords first, and immediately join hands with the Chinese people. This is something that the Japanese warlords have to guard against.

Based on the above, the Japanese warlords' banning of Hamlet is not without reason. However, whether the Japanese warlords have ever thought of these things, or whether they banned it simply because of "dangerous thoughts," is a question that is equally difficult to guess. If they have ever thought of this, we should point out that Hamlet's anguish and pessimism stem from a pure motive of revenge, and everyone sympathizes with him. But the Japanese warlords' distress and sorrow stem from aggressive ambitions, and they have only themselves to blame. Not only can no one in the world feel sorry for them, but those with a sense of justice will surely rise up to overthrow them.

### Miscellaneous Essays and Sketches

— Pinpin

Small articles of about a thousand words—truly "articles," because they are neither novels nor poems—can be divided into many categories, the most common being "miscellaneous essays" and "sketches."

Miscellaneous essays and sketches both belong to small articles, but each has its own strengths: field mice and house mice are both mice, but field mice have their own reasons for being "field mice," and house mice also have their own way of life.

Miscellaneous essays are somewhat like field mice, while sketches are somewhat like house mice. The distinction has nothing to do with the general name: something written as "Miscellaneous Essay ××" or "×× Miscellaneous Thoughts" can become a sketch if you look at its content. Similarly, there are some "sketch-like" things that, although crowned with the name "sketch," people will feel, after reading them, "This is a miscellaneous essay."

Field mice grow in the wild, struggling with nature to survive. And don't underestimate their weak bodies; they have a heroic spirit. House mice hide in the kitchen floor holes, looking for scraps to eke out a living. Sometimes they can't find scraps and are instead trapped in wire cages, meeting their end under boiling water and iron tongs. This shows that they lack a sense of righteousness.

The difference between miscellaneous essays and sketches lies in whether they have "backbone": those with backbone are like mountains, and so are miscellaneous essays; those without backbone are like sketches.

National affairs, cosmic wonders, social gore; speaking of them, the reasoning is straight and the spirit is upright, the telling is delightful and incisive, the attack is sharp and to the point: this is a miscellaneous essay. Trivial matters around oneself, illusions of the soul, ethereal feelings; writing about them, something is created from nothing; talking about them, there is grumbling and sourness; attacking them, there is emptiness and nothingness: sketches are generally like this.

In times of peace, let the sketch "go as it pleases"; but now is not such a "time." The sketch writer's "pen" is "pleasing" in a somewhat "too risky" way, and some are simply "incomprehensible."

A pen that has been infected after illness is most likely to write without backbone. To write small articles, you must take advantage of being strong and healthy. At that time, everything has the quality of flesh and blood, and you will never be tired, weak, or dejected. If you "moan without being sick," it will of course be even more unbearable. That kind of quiet feeling, the Lin Daiyu-style sigh, in the midst of the storm, can only be sent to the funeral home.

Some people oppose "anti-war stereotyped writing" and discourage "complaining about the situation," but you must not replace "complaining about the situation" with a "will." Complaining about the situation can still win sympathy, but a will is unbearable to read. I hope that miscellaneous essays become "mutual encouragement books" (higher than complaining about the situation) and do not become "wills" in a sour way. As for those sketch-like wills, please send them to the famous mountains for now.

### South China Soccer Team Conquers Vietnam - First Battle Sees a Great Victory Over the French League - Dehui Scores Four Goals, Zhaorong and Douwen Also Contribute

(Saigon Telegram) The Hong Kong South China soccer team arrived here on the 5th and played its first match against the French League team on the afternoon of the 7th. The audience was packed. South China performed extremely well, defeating the French League 7-4. Chen Dehui scored four goals, Li Zhaorong two, and Luo Douwen one.

The French League is a strong local team, known for its fast play and strong strength. Therefore, although South China won by as many as seven goals, they were also able to return four goals, which proves that the front line of the French League is not weak. It is just that the overall technique of the team is not as good as that of South China.

### Guanghua Almost Wins But Fails - Loses Two Goals at the End and Draws with the Scotsmen Again

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, the weather cleared up and the sun shone brightly, and both the soccer players and the spectators were delighted. Everyone said that the heavens were kind and did not miss the good event on the soccer field.

The Kowloon Society field, where the sea breeze blows in gusts, is usually deserted and abnormally quiet. But yesterday, Guanghua fought bravely against the Scotsmen here. More than a thousand spectators came to watch the performance and seek pleasure, breaking the silence.

Recently, Guanghua's record has been unremarkable. Yesterday, when they met the Scotsmen again, most people expected a bad outcome. The result was a 2-2 draw, which seems pretty good.

Originally, Guanghua had the possibility of winning, but because Zou Wenzhi missed the final shot on goal every time, his efforts were in vain, which is very regrettable.

Guanghua adopted a fast-passing strategy, which is conducive to rapid attacks, so they scored two goals in the first half, creating an absolute advantage. However, they committed the mistake of holding on for too long and things went wrong. They started strong but finished weak, and the Scotsmen eventually recovered their lost ground in the second half.

The reason why Guanghua could not maintain its victory was not due to a lack of energy, but to a lack of experience. For example, the loss of the first goal was their own fault. If it weren't for this accident, the Scotsmen would have inevitably suffered a defeat.

In fact, the Scotsmen's performance yesterday was not good. Apart from sudden passes and sudden rushes, there was no strategy or coordination. The entire front line did not have a coherent attacking method, because the wings and inside forwards could not allow the skilled rusher He Xi to receive and display his skills. Therefore, although He Xi was brave, he sighed that he was alone and helpless.

Guanghua created many opportunities with its fast passes and rapid attacks, but unfortunately Wen Qia did not have eyes on his feet and missed many shots. I believe that Wenzhi should work hard on shooting from now on.

Zhuo Shijin's long-range shots had the style of Li Huitang. He showed many wonderful skills in yesterday's battle, and although he did not hit the target, he won the praise of the spectators.

Huang Jingcong and Qian Chifen both made good contributions. Liang Bingjin was indeed agile, but his cutting skills were not yet top-notch.

Yang Zixiang, who was in the center, often took the opportunity to attack and assist the front line, which was considered to be on the right track. He is an indispensable figure for the front line to rely on the support of the rear. Huang Huaji and Zhong Wei Lin also maintained their strength throughout, but in the end, the first goal was lost due to Ao Zeng's fault, and his merits could not compensate for his demerits.

Hou Rongsheng's head is quick and sharp. With training, he will surely become a great talent. Zhang Weihui is tall enough. Relying on this innate advantage, he showed good technique. Li Guoqi is also making progress day by day.

The Scotsmen's performance had no strategy to speak of, but their fighting spirit was good. They calmly dealt with the situation and were eventually able to reverse the decline. The whole army was led by Boro, Deng Qin, and He Xi. Fei Sha was also good, but the rest were mediocre. The two teams were lined up as follows during the battle: (Ball Field Grand Duke)

Guanghua Society

Li Guoqi

Zhong Huilin Hou Rongsheng

Huang Huaji Yang Zixiang Zhang Shu

Huang Jingcong Zou Wenzhi Zhuo Shijin Qian Chifen Liang Bingjin

Scotsmen Team

Deng Qin

McDonald Fraser

Keller Boro Apdansen

Hams Allen He Xi Frankming Wenlu

With a sound of the starting whistle, the two sides began to fight. Guanghua sent its troops forward. After retreating for a while, Shijin rushed into the abdomen of the Scotsmen. Fraser resisted with his spear. Shijin used his wit to slip past the defense and launched a long-range shot. Deng Qin blocked it into a corner kick. Bingjin opened it, and the landing point was very good. McDonald and Fraser greeted it from the left and right, which took a lot of effort. In the midst of the chaotic crowd, Chifen took the opportunity to shoot quickly, hitting the bullseye. Deng Qin returned to save, but it was too late. Guanghua opened the scoring 1-0.

Guanghua first declared victory, and its military prestige was greatly boosted. It frequently put pressure on the Scotsmen's position, but the Scotsmen defended tenaciously and could not gain any more. Suddenly, Allen was injured in a brave battle and left the field, leaving only ten men to fight. Guanghua, with its numerical superiority, was even more energetic. Five riders attacked, causing the Scotsmen to be besieged on all sides. Shijin fired an arrow at the goal, as fast as a shooting star. Hui Dengqin was extremely alert and blocked it out of bounds.

Boro covered the front army, sneaking through the checkpoints. Hams ambushed under the city and shot immediately after getting the ball, but fortunately it did not cause a disaster.

Soon, Guanghua returned and attacked again. Jingcong went to the meeting alone and shot fiercely at the goal. Deng Wei rushed out to grab the ball. At this time, the wind and crane were howling under the city of the Scotsmen. They still had to rely on McDonald's hard work and tenacious resistance to get through the crisis.

He Xi got the ball and passed it far to Wenlu. Shuhui resisted the incoming troops and sent the ball to the front. Bingjin attacked on the frontier. The Scotsmen's rear defense was empty, but Wen Qia was too hasty and shot off the field, losing a good opportunity. The first half ended with Guanghua leading 1-0.

After the break, the Scotsmen, with their homeland lost, tried their best to survive. However, Guanghua was determined to win, and the whole army exerted its strength. After a while, Chifen drove lightly, crossed Fraser, and McDonald rushed out to block. Chifen immediately launched a shot, and Deng Qin was busy dealing with it, and the good news was transmitted again to Guanghua.

He Xi intended to make things difficult, and Xing Allen divided his troops to raid. Wenlu sneaked in from the frontier. Zixiang and Shuhui were already prepared and repelled the incoming troops.

Shijin got the chance and used his superb skills to shoot through the willow again from afar. Deng Qin was quick-eyed and quick-handed and was able to turn the danger into safety. Soon after, Wenzhi again briefly entered the abdomen of the Scotsmen. McDonald entangled him with all his strength, and Deng Qin rushed out to meet and save. The goal was empty, but Shijin's momentum was too fast and he shot out of bounds.

After a while, He Xi and Frankming launched a rear attack. Guoqi calmly dealt with it and did not lose his defense. Xian Tu also attacked the gate twice, but to no avail.

Soon after, Chifen took advantage of the opportunity to advance, crossed Fraser, and quickly passed it to Jingcong. But because the reinforcements were not sustained, it was all in vain. After the Scotsmen lifted the siege, they launched a counterattack, forcing a corner kick. The ball was opened by Jiaolu, and a crowd of heads appeared. He Xi headed the ball, and the momentum was very slow, but Huaji and Huilin accidentally misunderstood each other, did not kick the ball with their feet, and let the ball roll into the net. Guoqi's cover was too late.

From this, the military prestige of the Scotsmen was revived. Frankming and He Xi came again. Before they could defend themselves, He Xi took another step forward and raised his foot to shoot, and the ball responded to the sound of the net.

At this time, Guanghua became anxious and the three armies were mobilized. Bingjin got the ball and cut in. Wenzhi grabbed the ball and shot, but the ball was too slow. Deng Qin swooped to save it, but Fei Sha cleared it with one kick. Guanghua then lost its last chance. At the end of the game, each team got one point and the troops were withdrawn.

### Da Sheng Cup Volleyball Tournament - Paul Wins - Overwhelms South China Three to One

The Da Sheng Cup volleyball tournament was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM between Luo Paul and South China at the Bok Gung Ball Field. Both sides sent a full team to the match, so the battle was extremely intense. After the start of the game, South China gave a show of strength. Paul calmly responded to the challenge. Li Mingxiang and Ouyang Shaotang scored successively. In the first set, Paul won 21-18. After losing the first set, South China's Hu Yaodong shouted encouragement, and the three armies used their orders to fight hand-to-hand for a long time, and finally recovered their lost ground by 21-20. In the third set, Paul met the challenge with a strict formation. As a result of their efforts, they defeated South China 21-17. After that, South China's morale was reduced, and Paul took the opportunity to frequently apply pressure, and still won 21-18, creating a ratio of three to one. The formation is as follows (Paul)

### Jingwu Association Seeks Recruitment - Achievements Are Quite Good

Since the Jingwu Sports Association issued the recruitment, the achievements have been quite considerable. It was originally scheduled to end on the 8th of this month, but each recruitment team is busy with affairs and cannot count the statistics in a short time. Therefore, the association has specially extended the deadline to the end of this month, the 30th.

### Ballroom Silhouette

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The night before last, there were two women's ordinary-grade basketball games. In the first game, Pui To played against South China, and in the second game, Meifang played against Overseas Chinese. One was funny and hilarious, and the other was thrilling and intense. Therefore, the flower-like bits and pieces are recorded here.

Pui To is a strong team this year. Since they started, they have not met an opponent and will undoubtedly win a great victory in the battle against South China, where the strong and the weak are far apart. Therefore, the audience in the first game was not crowded.

Li Ruolan was quite active on the front line, but because she was inherently impatient, she shouted "Here!" incessantly every time she got the ball, and the fans laughed endlessly.

Li Shuzhen and Ruomei have the same surname and also got Ruomei's style, like to sing. In the basketball room, they sing in harmony, which is quite interesting.

Zhang Meihuan is short and fat, and her turning skills are still not agile. When she met Kwan Shuk-ching of Pui To, they were like two drunkards fighting together, "You bump me, I bump you," which was quite funny and made the fans laugh until they bent over.

Pui To's three forwards are quite well-proportioned, but Xu Yinghua played carelessly, without any tension, so there was no exciting performance. Luo Shaoxi and Liu Yiyin were quite likable to play with.

The South China girls were still quite active, with the forwards fighting hard to attack and the rear guard desperately defending. Li Ruomei, Li Zhenyong, and the three armies, however, were brave but lacked strategy and could only sigh helplessly. Moreover, the coordination was scattered and the shooting was still inaccurate. And the rear guards Wang Ailan and Feng Qianyu tried their best to block and kill the incoming generals, but the forwards of Pui To were extremely fierce. In the second half, they were even more exhausted, which led to a complete defeat.

The next game was Meifang against Overseas Chinese. When the two teams meet, there will definitely be a fierce battle, so the basketball referees brought out all their personnel and handled the matter with caution, lest they repeat the incident of knowing the line of duty.

Yip Meilian, this little girl, is short and capable, and her turning skills are sharp and agile, and her backhand shots are always accurate. As far as the overall performance is concerned, the most outstanding individual is undoubtedly Meilian.

Lu Huixian fought quite quietly, but delicate flowers are difficult to withstand the ravages of the wind, and whenever she faces a strong enemy, she always feels that it is difficult to display her strengths.

Wu Huanying still fought fiercely, and those who stood in her way retreated in confusion. Chen Hui and Sun Yuming supervised the Overseas Chinese forwards, which was more than enough.

At the end of the game, Sun Yuming accidentally got bumped into by an Overseas Chinese forward. Both eyes were burning with fire, and she could not move. The spectators frequently called out, "Victory or defeat is a common thing for soldiers. Why cry?"

Ah Q (Liu Shouguang) is both wise and brave, throwing the ball to the east and passing it to the west, fooling the opponent. The fans all said "Ah Q is a good plan" incessantly.

Shi Bimei fought fiercely and showed her sharp edge. Rao Xianzhen and Chen Yihua did not have a good performance. The Meifang generals were able to penetrate deep into the hinterland and do whatever they wanted. Overseas Chinese was suppressed, (Lu Xia)

### Film and Drama

Entertainment…Sea Corner Wanderer Algfers

The story is set in a mysterious and strange place like those described in "Arabian Nights." The place is called Algiers. Although it is now a French territory, part of the city is quite modern. However, another part, inhabited by the natives, still completely retains the mysterious tone of ancient the East. It is a lawless place, a gathering place for thieves and outlaws. The director has handled such a background with the utmost sinister and chilling skill, which further highlights a moving story. The treacherous and brutal actions of the bandits fill every inch of the film with mystery, terror, and intense stimulating power.

The story tells of an international thief who flees to this place. He evades the betrayal of his accomplices and the pursuit of detectives, but succumbs to a beautiful French woman—and loses his life.

Charles Boyer gives a very profound portrayal of the thief's character in this film. Hedy Lamarr, who played the heroine in "Ecstasy," also performs excellently. Xue Lie Jiali, in her first film, "Marco Polo Travels to China," left us with a very good impression when she played Kublai Khan's daughter. In this film, she plays a native girl who passionately loves the thief. Her outstanding acting is worthy of our special praise.

The whole film describes the rise of the American aviation industry in the past thirty or forty years. It can also be said to be a systematic narrative of mankind's conquest of space. At the same time, we must admit that this is a great and valuable work in the history of film.

The story seems to be too broad, and the plot is lengthy, which makes people feel a slight lack of dramatic power. However, the tension and thrilling scenes completely cover up this shortcoming. Like the dangerous encounters in flight, the great aerial battles, the trials of life and death, the first feat of crossing the Atlantic, escaping from a burning plane with a parachute, etc., these are all extremely stimulating scenes. There are also passionate people with a spirit of fearlessness and lofty ambitions, doing earth-shattering feats. Behind them, there are also women who encourage and help them, and at the same time worry and sob. These all have the power to manipulate the audience's emotions.

The use of color is perfect for this film. From the beginning of those wild scenery, to the various brightly colored airplanes soaring in the blue sky full of colorful clouds, the beauty of the picture adds a lot of aesthetic feeling to the audience.

Fletcher Markle and Ray Milland's acting skills are both extremely refined. The heroine, Louise Campbell, is a rising star. She used to act in some relatively ordinary films and did not receive much attention. In this film, we find that she is a very promising talent.

A musical film interspersed with humor, full of laughter. The horse racing scene inside is both tense and funny. Starring Bing Crosby and Frey Mai Maolan.

Dahua—Blockade

Blockade is a film about the activities of traitors during the war, but on the other hand, it exposes the cruelty of the war. This is the point that the author particularly emphasizes. The director uses very lively shots to reflect the various vicious means of bombing and blockade. Henry Fonda and Madeleine Carroll also perform well.

Jingxing…Woman's Normal State Woman Ase Llke That

It tells the story of a woman competing with her husband in her career, which caused a misunderstanding and made him very discouraged. Later, after the explanation of a third party, the wife retired herself, and they reconciled as before. The performances of the two protagonists are flat.

Central…Woman

Mandarin film

It was made into a silent film three years ago. The consciousness of this film is very correct. The editor is completely appealing for the pain that women have not been sympathized with for thousands of years.

Generally speaking, it is not necessarily more advanced than the silent film era, but the writing is more lively. The new star Lu Ming and the other actors are all outstanding.

### The Relationship Between Physical Exercise and Diet

— Wang Xue Zheng

However, some people think that the amount of food for breakfast should be the richest, and the dinner should be the least. This statement is exactly the opposite of the above. Their reason is that the human body machine is no different. It must be fully fueled before work, in order to achieve the highest efficiency. Morning is the beginning of the day. Therefore, there must be a very rich breakfast; reducing dinner can facilitate sleep. But this is all a wrong view. Most people feel mentally exhausted after dinner, especially after lunch. Some people must take a nap after dinner, because most of the blood and energy are concentrated on the digestive function, so that the brain lacks blood. Moreover, labor before the food is digested. Not only is the spirit not uplifted, and cannot exert all its strength. And it hinders the digestive function. As a result, the nutrition of the food cannot be fully absorbed. From this, it can be proved that it is most reasonable to say that the amount of food for breakfast should be less, and the amount of food for dinner should be more.

There are still twelve points that should be paid attention to here. Now I will extract them below:……

(1) Eat at a fixed time.

(2) Do not eat unless hungry.

(3) The quality of food depends on the strength of digestive ability and the different needs of individuals. Those who are tall and burly in appearance do not necessarily have a more vigorous digestive ability than those who are short.

(4) Eat nine parts full when you are ten parts hungry.

(5) Only eat light and common foods; the types of food eaten per meal should not be too many. Do not force yourself to eat foods you dislike.

(6) Do not eat too quickly; do not use brainpower or physical strength when eating, so as to concentrate your energy on the digestive function.

(7) Do not drink cold drinks while eating.

(8) Do not eat other miscellaneous things between two meals.

(9) Do not eat one or several foods alone on a regular basis.

(10) Vigorously abstain from irritating foods.

(11) Be careful to chew when eating, do not gobble it up, or wash it down with soup.

(12) Do not eat when you are mentally depressed or feeling tired. Do not exercise half an hour or one hour before eating, and within one hour after eating.

Nor can you use brainpower. As for the quality of food, it cannot be completely ignored either. The quality and quantity can also be said to be inversely proportional to each other. The so-called quality refers to its nutritional value, digestibility, and the vitamins it contains. Foods with a very high nutritional value, eating only a small amount, can maintain health, and those with a small nutritional value, then the amount of food must be increased. It has been said above. We do not need to adopt foods such as delicacies from land and sea. As long as a large amount of vegetables, grains, plus a small amount of meat, it is enough to maintain health. In addition, as long as you add fruits, nuts, vegetable oil and vegetable sugar, it is extremely nutritious food. The nutritional value of milk and eggs is also not below this kind of food. As for grains, unrefined ones are the best. If the bran and other things are removed, it is not only an economic loss, but also a nutritional loss. In addition, root vegetables such as potatoes are also very beneficial to health. (Below)

### Roosevelt Asks Congress to Authorize Sanctions Against Japan and Germany, the US Army Sub-Praises the Pan-American Conference, and the Idea of Opening a Canal in Central America Rises Again

[Central News Agency Washington, 7th] President Roosevelt's message to Congress has aroused a good response in domestic and foreign public opinion. The government has been encouraged and is preparing to submit a bill to Congress requesting authorization for the government to retaliate economically against those who discriminate against American interests in various foreign countries, or who discriminate against American interests because of race or religion. The focus of this use is to deal with Japan and Germany.

[Reuters, Mount Arab, Montana, Joe Malai, 7th] US Army Undersecretary Johnson said at the memorial meeting for the late President Jackson, "The significance of this Pan-American Conference in the history of free countries is equal to the American Declaration of Independence. The conference has shown the unity of the people of North and South America, and its principles are 'harmony, tolerance, freedom, peace and democracy.' The United States upholds this principle as a powerful response to the aggressive forces of the Old World," he said.

[Central News Agency Washington, 7th] A Democratic Congressman from Virginia, Chairman of the House Merchant Marine Committee, Brand, recently submitted a proposal to the House, advocating the opening of a canal within the territory of the Republic of Nicaragua in Central America, or the release of the Panama Canal. The Nicaragua proposal was mentioned in Congress a few years ago, and this is the first time that it has attracted people's attention. The New York Times published an article on this plan at the beginning of December last year, which briefly stated that this river is about 276 kilometers long and requires a cost of about 725 million US dollars. The US military authorities believe that the Panama Canal is extremely easy to destroy in wartime, and this new canal is of great military importance, and it is necessary to open it.

### British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Visit Italy to Discuss International Issues Broadly, Germany Hopes to Reopen the Four-Power Conference and Reiterates Old Colonial Demands

[Reuters Rome, 7th] When Chamberlain and Halifax arrive here, they will be warmly welcomed by the Italian people. The streets will be decorated with flags, and the reception program has been arranged. Chamberlain will have a meeting with Mussolini. Political observers believe that they will have several meetings to discuss a wide range of international issues. Today's newspapers also hinted at the possibility of holding a four-power conference to discuss Italy's demands for the Mediterranean and other issues. It is generally expected that, in view of the imbalance of power caused by the backwardness of Munich, the British and Italian authorities will consider the relationship between centralized countries and the people's nations. They will also discuss some minor issues that only concern Britain and Italy, including the new treaty negotiations stipulated in the Anglo-Italian Agreement, the solution to the Anglo-Italian African territorial boundary issue, and the future of the Mediterranean, etc.

[Central News Agency Berlin, 7th] As British Prime Minister Chamberlain is about to visit Italy, German political figures all hope that Prime Minister Chamberlain will persuade the French authorities to allow a conference to be held by the four powers of France, Britain, Germany and Italy to discuss the Mediterranean Valley issues. In order to realize its various demands, Italy may cause encounters in the area adjacent to the French and Italian territories, and then mobilize the navy. Prime Minister Chamberlain is deeply afraid that Germany will take action to assist Italy, and will send Saudi Arabia to participate in the four-power conference. In this way, Germany can also take the opportunity to raise colonial demands at the conference. German political figures hope so, but experienced observers suggest that if there is a serious conflict between France and Italy, Germany may not use force to assist Italy. Moreover, if it is known that the dispute between France and Italy is enough to cause a world conflict, it may even refuse to fully support Italy's demands. In short, what Germany hopes is that Britain will come forward in France and Italy.

[Central News Agency Berlin, 8th] The "National Daily," which is known as the mouthpiece of German Aviation Minister Goering, recently reiterated its demand for the return of Germany's former colonies. The newspaper said, "From an economic point of view, Germany cannot tolerate further delay in resolving the colonial issue. All parties prohibit Germany from having any intentions in Africa, which is the responsibility of Jewish people from all countries, because the purpose of Jewish people is to first obtain Africa in order to restore their inherent power."

### British New Cruiser [Liverpool] Is About to Sail to the Far East

[Reuters London, 7th] The British new cruiser "Liverpool" will soon sail to the Far East. It has now arrived in Liverpool for a ceremonial visit. The people of Liverpool welcomed the ship with a silver dish, a silk badge and a national flag, which were presented to the ship as a welcome gift. The ship's captain, Radar, said, "If a European war were to break out now, the Emden incident would certainly not last as long as it did then. Our real task is to protect ships and trade in wartime." It is reported that the silver dish was presented by the Mayor of Liverpool, and the silk badge and the British flag were presented by the Countess of Sefton.

### Swiss Passenger Plane Crashes, Passengers Dead and Injured Fourteen People

[Central News Agency Paris, 8th] A Swiss Airlines passenger plane crashed near Senlis, north of Paris, yesterday, killing two passengers and injuring twelve people.

### Johnson Goes to France

[Central News Agency Marseille, 8th] Awarded to the Chinese Ambassador Zhan, who flew from Chongqing to Marseille by plane, and transferred back to China. Yesterday, due to the bad weather, he failed to fly to Paris and changed to taking a train.

### British Oil Industry Losses, Mexico Has Compensated

[Reuters, Mexico City, 7th] The Mexican Foreign Minister today handed over a check for 15,000 to the Danish public to secretly price the British oil industry losses confiscated during the Mexican Revolution. The Danish minister is exercising his functions on behalf of the British Embassy. The Mexican government also sent paper tickets to the representatives of France and Italy to communicate compensation for debts.

### The Military Strength of Centralized Countries, Washington's Estimate, British Newspapers Believe Is Too High

[Reuters London, 8th] The Sunday Times air force correspondent said, "The military strength of European countries issued by Washington is not only inaccurate, but also overestimates the air force strength of centralized countries. Washington estimated that at the time of signing the Munich Agreement, there were 10,000 airplanes in the country, 3,500 in Italy, 600 in France, and 1,700 in the United States. According to my reliable reports, at the end of September last year, the number of airplanes in various countries was 3,200 in Germany, 1,750 in Italy, 1,150 in France, and 2,200 in Britain. The British authorities firmly believe that British aircraft are driven by more pilots than any other country."

### British Aircraft Industry Overcomes Difficulties

[Reuters London, 8th] The 'Star Observer' air force correspondent today met with Mr. Spes Faering of Hawkesley Dairies, the world's largest aircraft manufacturing organization. The correspondent said, "The British aircraft manufacturing industry has now overcome major difficulties. The number of aircraft manufactured annually and the quality are comparable to any other country." Mr. S said, "The steps taken by Britain in the past few years have been very satisfactory. Now Britain has a large-scale production of aircraft."

### The Czech-Hungarian Mixed Committee Investigates the Course of the Conflict, the Czech Republic Hopes to Find an Appropriate Solution with a Peaceful Attitude

[Central News Agency, Beijing, 8th] Yesterday, the Czech side issued a communiqué, requesting that the mixed committee composed of the Czech and Hungarian sides had gone to the border to investigate the Czech-Hungarian conflict incident. The committee held its first meeting yesterday afternoon. It is reported that the government is now investigating the origin and course of the incident. The Czech side also hopes that the governments of the two countries can examine all aspects of the situation with a peaceful and cooperative attitude, so as to make the border peaceful and no longer have such incidents.

[Haitong Agency, Czech Republic, Beijing, 8th] To simplify the official, it denies that Czech troops had occupied the suburbs of Khashkewa. Also, the Czech reply to the Hungarian protest was delivered to the Hungarian ambassador stationed in Prague yesterday. It is heard that the content is a suggestion that both sides investigate the truth in a friendly manner, in the hope that similar incidents will not occur in the border in the future.

[Central News Agency, Czech Republic, Beijing, 7th] Regarding the Mukachevo incident, the semi-official side recently issued a communiqué stating that the area has returned to peace since 5:00 p.m. yesterday. The autonomous government of the Carpathian Ruthenian province has sent Liaison Officer Lieutenant Lu Shizhong to assist the joint committee composed of Czech and Hungarian military officers on the spot. In addition, the military authorities also issued a communiqué on the course of the incident, stating that the Hungarian army team in the vicinity of the Czech-Hungarian border Khashkewa was assisted by armed people, and opened fire with the Heike country's military troops on January 6. Until the afternoon, it stopped after the intervention of the liaison officer of the Aifang army. The troops also restored the original defense along the border line. The joint committee composed of Czech and Hungarian military officers started investigating the course of the situation this afternoon, in the hope of finding an appropriate solution.

[Reuters, Czech Republic, Beijing, 7th] A communiqué issued here today stated that according to the preliminary investigation of the Muka Cheva conflict, the results showed that the participants on both sides were border police and a small number of troops. The participants on the Hungarian side were soldiers and armed people. Both sides had crossed the border, and after the intervention of both palace leftists, the war had stopped, and each had returned to the boundary line. It is heard that only two people died in the Czech Republic.

[Haitong Agency, Hungary, Beijing, 8th] Four Hungarians were killed in the Mukachevo conflict. It is heard that today, at the time of the martyrs' ceremony, there are still nine injured people in Khashkewa, including three civilians, two women, and one boy, all of whom were hit by stray bullets.

[Reuters, Hungary, Beijing, 7th] According to the Hungarian official Puxi News Agency, the Tik army moved again to the Kerashti Romarzho area near Muka Scheva, and said that the Czech army was moving wooden planks and counter-hangers, and its purpose was obviously to build a bridge to cross the Lato Ka River, so as to transport troops to Waku Zaza.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th] After the dispute between the Czech and Hungarian countries, well-informed sources here recently declared that the German government intends to make serious representations to the Czech and Hungarian subordinate countries, urging them to strictly abide by the Vienna organization's arbitration declaration on the issue of boundary demarcation in each country. Political figures here were very surprised after hearing about the incident, and said that Italy had convened the Vienna Conference and issued the arbitration book after both the Czech and Hungarian sides requested it. Now, it is regrettable that the situation in that corner of Europe has not yet been pacified. It can be asserted that the perpetrators must be irresponsible people in the local area, and the authorities of both the Czech and Hungarian countries do not trust each other.

### The Netherlands Will Cooperate With Britain to Maintain the Price of Gold Pounds

[Reuters, Beijing, 7th] The Netherlands' attitude towards the British method of holding currency has not yet been determined, but it is generally believed that it will not refuse to cooperate with Britain in order to prevent gold investment and trading. Various newspapers pointed out that the significance of maintaining the price of the pound is extremely important. The British pound rate is a very important factor for the various undertakings of the Dutch, American and Dutch East Indian banquets, because its price is calculated in British currency. The recent fall in the price of gold pounds has affected commerce.

### Tom Menney Released, No Relation to Counterfeit Gold Mountain Case

[Reuters, Long Creek, 7th] Tom Menney, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in San Francisco in 1919 for his involvement in a bombing case, was today pardoned by California Governor Olsen. Olsen said, "High Court Judge Mac Tuo told me that when the bombing case occurred that day, the police and detectives of Fenfa Mountain followed Tom Menney and closely monitored his actions. He did not actually participate in the case, and he was not at the scene of the incident at the time. The previous five California governors did not know about it, which is a pity." Olsen finally declared that if anyone opposed the pardon of Tom Menney, please stand up and speak. In the end, no one opposed it.

### Alps Glacier Collapses the Other Day, Skiers Buried

[Haitong Press, Paris, 8th] On Saturday, while traveling back to Paris, French Prime Minister Daladier briefly addressed the Orange city council. He elaborated on France’s position during the Munich Agreement and warned the world that France was not divided into factions, but rather that the French people did not wish to participate in global warfare. He also stated that "If the French people desire to maintain peace, they must unite. If internal disunity and weaknesses arise, they will inevitably be sacrificed by those who wield weapons day and night." He also commented, "Foreign newspapers are repeatedly spreading rumors that chaos will erupt in France. These rumors are intended to acquire French territories and advantages in the Mediterranean and elsewhere." He added that upon returning, he would devote himself to maintaining national unity, stabilizing national work and order, and ensuring the lasting consolidation of the French republic and democratic government.

Arab Delegation to Postpone Trip to England

[Reuters, Cairo, 7th] The Arab delegates attending the London Palestine Conference may postpone their departure to England because the Chinese government has not permitted them to meet with the Islamic religious leader.  The Islamic religious leader is currently exiled in Lebanon, a territory under French mandate. France is not allowing the Arab delegates to meet with the Islamic religious leader, but will allow them to communicate via telegram or letters. The Arab delegates insist on a personal meeting with the Islamic religious leader to discuss the composition of the Arab delegation.

### Anti-Aggression Congress Demands British Prime Minister Warn Italy: No Guarantee of Friendship if Italy Continues to Interfere in the Spanish War

[Reuters, London, 8th]  Four hundred delegates from the International Anti-Aggression Movement, led by the Duke and Duchess of Atholl, went to Downing Street today to submit a resolution to Chamberlain. The resolution urges Chamberlain to explicitly express to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini during his visit to Rome that if Italy continues to interfere in the Spanish war, the British people cannot guarantee continued friendly relations with Italy. The resolution also opposes granting belligerent rights to Franco, and instead advocates for granting all international rights to the Spanish Republic.

[Central News Agency, Saragossa, 8th] Yesterday, the Spanish Republican Army crossed the Ebro River and entered the southern part of the province of Tarragona. The Nationalist forces are advancing from Amposta, now only twelve miles from the coast. The government forces in the Ebro Delta region are in a critical situation. The government forces are hastening to reinforce the line. The air defense capabilities of the government forces are gradually collapsing, and the Nationalist forces are making progress on all fronts.

### Hitler's Hungary

— By Henry C. Wolfe, translated by Bao Ren, from the December issue of Current History

Various newspapers and periodicals at home and abroad have discussed the strategy of Hitler in Eastern Europe, and there is no consensus. In this text, it can tell you the conspiracy of the National Socialist Party in Hungary, as well as the current situation of the anti-fascist factions in Hungary. Eckhardt is the leader of the Hungarian anti-fascist faction. When Austria was annexed by Germany last year, he said to Czech Prime Minister Xindechai that unless the small countries form an alliance in the Danube River, the small and weak countries will inevitably be annexed by Hitler. He explained that the first victim was Austria, the second was Czechoslovakia, and the third was Hungary. Now the first and second have been guessed, will the third be transported to Hungary? Here it will also give you a reasonable answer. ——Translator's Note——

A thousand years ago, the Hungarians established a kingdom on the Pannonian Plain near the Danube River. At that time, she was the natural boundary between Western civilization and the uncivilized peoples of the East, and also a fortress for the countries that believed in Christianity to defend against the westward invasion of Turkey. The Hungarian people are naturally very staunch and have a very deep sense of race. After their country was conquered by Turkey in 1526, even though the Turkish authorities loved and did not oppress the Hungarian nation, they could not break their national concept. After the end of the European War, Hungary suffered a brutal division, but their morale was still good. Although their own country was frustrated, they never lost heart and were willing to fight for the country to the end.

Now the political center of Europe has shifted from the Rhine region to the Danube region. Hungary has once again become the frontline for European countries to defend against the eastward invasion of Fascist countries. However, this is the opposite of the situation in 1526. The source of his troubles has changed from the southeast to the northwest. Since the Munich Four-Power Conference, the Czech Republic has lost its importance in Europe after Britain, France and other countries divided the Czech territory. Hitler removed half of the obstacles for his eastward advance. In the future, Hungary may become the next target of aggression in the National Socialist Party's eastward policy.

Hitler's underlying trend is to first invade Austria and Czechoslovakia, and then open up to the Balkan countries and Ukraine. Today, his first two steps have been successful one after another. We only need to review the past relationship between Hungary and Hungary to know that Hitler will never forget Hungary. However, the Hungarian people have long been wary of the ambitions of the leaders of the National Socialist Party. In order to plan for the future, they have begun to step up the defense lines on the border as a preparation to prevent Germany from advancing eastward.

Within Hungary, there are fascist and anti-fascist parties. The fascist faction advocates cooperation with Hitler to form a Brown Shirt Nazi axis, while the anti-fascist faction advocates cooperation with the Little Entente and is unwilling to be a mouthpiece for fascist aggressors. Therefore, the party struggles between the two factions are very fierce. Who wins and who loses? This question has a great impact on the entire European situation.

Nineteen years ago, the Treaty of Trianon ceded most of Hungary's territory to Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. Later, in order to prevent Hungary from rising up and retaliating against them in the future, one country initiated the organization of the Little Entente group to surround Hungary, isolate its position, and restrict its armament, so that it would never be able to revive. However, no matter how dangerous the national situation is, the national spirit of the Hungarians will never be depressed as a result. At that time, the capital of Hungary, Budapest, was still full of vigor and peace. The people were very calm, and there was no disorder or anxiety in the market. This national characteristic is worthy of our admiration.

After the war, Hungary's national situation was in a slump. Except for the four countries of Germany, Italy, Austria and Bulgaria in Europe, which expressed sympathy for her, other countries generally did not have good feelings towards him. Until Hitler came to power and German power was revived. Under the assistance of the National Socialist Party, Hungary's national power gradually invaded and flourished. Therefore, during the era of the former Gombos cabinet, Hungary's internal affairs were completely thrown into the arms of Fascist Hitler. Even when Sltolnyay was in office, Hungary's policy was still in the same vein as the Fascist aggressors. However, one thing we should pay attention to is that Hungary's purpose in pleasing Germany is entirely to rely on Germany's efforts to help him destroy the Little Entente and achieve the demands of military equality and restoring lost land. They never want their government to have a Nazi Party dictator. In the minds of the Hungarians, most people believe that the government should only cooperate and be friendly with Germany, and absolutely does not allow the government authorities to have Nazi Party members.

After Hitler annexed Austria, the Hungarian people have always felt uneasy about the safety of their own country, because Austria is the buffer country between Hungary and Hungary. After the merger of Germany and Austria, Hungary's territory is closer to powerful Germany, so that its internal affairs and diplomacy cannot be immune to Germany's threats. At the same time, the large-scale organization and activities of the Nazi Party in Hungary made the Hungarian authorities feel like a thorn in their backs. Recently, 500,000 ethnic minorities and Hungarian fascist people in Hungary have come out to engage in personnel activities. After being funded by Germany, they have organized so-called "Arrow Cross Regiment", "Sickle Cross Regiment", "Fire Line Regiment", "Fire Cross Regiment", "Fire Alliance" and "Assault Team Regiment" etc. Although in name they are mostly patriotic groups, they are actually propaganda machines for the National Socialist movement. Recently, many young National Socialist Party members have been wearing black breeches, brown coats, and holding swastikas, demonstrating and marching in the city and along the Danube River, inciting the people and attempting to overthrow the government and seize power. Under this kind of situation, the rulers of Hungary naturally have to frown.

Short Commentary

### Northwest War Situation

The war situation in the Northwest has become tense in the past few days, but it is still just a period of preparation for a major battle. According to a special dispatch from Xi'an on the 8th, the Shanxi army has added more than 10,000 troops, and the continued force is about 60,000 to 70,000 people. Assuming that these troops can be quickly assembled and dispersed under unified command, it will certainly have a mutual effect on the war situation on the Yellow River front line, but there is absolutely no power to cross the river by any means. We have many winning conditions in the Northwest war zone, the main ones are: (1) The vast area of Shanxi Province is still under the control of our army and the people. The troops must be dispersed, it is not easy to concentrate, and a little movement will inevitably be attacked by us; (2) Along the Yellow River, the front line has the Central Army tightly deployed with new strategies, and the flanks and Pingluo line have the latest major national defense projects; our army can attack or defend, and the troops' movement will have the fate of taking the Yellow River as a grave; (3) Yan's rear is supported by the existence and development of the anti-Japanese base areas in the Jin-Cha-Ji border area and the Ji-Yu border area, and the police in Shandong have also established special military regions to promote the war in Yan's rear; (4) The rear of the Northwest battlefield also has the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area, the anti-Japanese general base area in the Northwest, the mass mobilization work, the creation of new armies and the training of military and political talents, which have already been seen in practice and have fulfilled the mission of helping the front line, and can serve as a model for the active new anti-offensive forces in the rear provinces. However, there are still serious difficulties in the Northwest war zone, that is, material difficulties. The army's weapons and equipment, the soldiers' clothing and weaving, and even medical drugs, air defense and anti-poison equipment are still very lacking! What's more, at this time of severe winter, the Yan people will implement even more cruel methods of attack in the future, such as releasing a large amount of gas and indiscriminate bombing, etc. Therefore, we should make special efforts to contribute money and efforts to meet the various requirements of the front line. The future war is a national war, and the Northwest is the main base area for the all-out war. Don't be indifferent because the distance is a little far!

### World Trends in a Week

— By Pan Lang

From January 2nd to 8th, 1939

We have stepped into the new year of 1939 from the dark, difficult and bloody 1938, and we really have the feeling of "when the dark clouds dissipate, the sky is particularly bright." The "Year of Victory" that the readers and new gentlemen have been longing for may not necessarily be in sight, but the signs of victory are already beckoning to us! Now let me give a brief report on the world situation in the second week of 1919. Although this report is still full of bloody smell, the factors of victory are also jumping!

Wang Jingwei's Betrayal

The defeatist and capitulationist Wang Jingwei finally betrayed from the anti-Japanese national united front. This is a major event, but it is also a happy event. In the past, Wang used the name and reputation of the Kuomintang to carry out the line of capitulationism and defeatism under the banner of resisting Japan, which caused great damage to our war of resistance and nation-building. Especially after the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, he saw the political progress under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, the progress of the people of the whole country, and the difficulty of Japan's attack. He then plotted to launch a coup to solve Japan's difficulties, divide our country's unity, hinder the war of resistance, seize power, and implement the line of surrendering to Japan, Germany, and Italy. When the members of the central government who firmly advocated resisting Japan were mostly fighting on the front line, he stretched out to take advantage of the opportunity to control the full congress of the force. At that time, he constantly published articles with good titles, practicing guerrilla warfare, protracted warfare, and scorched earth warfare to help Japan implement the "New Deal." However, the tide of the whole country from top to bottom insisting on resisting Japan finally broke all his shelters. The central government temporarily decided to postpone the Fifth Plenary Session, and all sectors expressed indignation at Wang's activities that violated national policy. This traitor had no choice but to escape from the capital of the war of resistance.

Progress in China's Military and Politics

Wang fled from the capital of the war of resistance, and also wanted to incite some local military authorities, and also distributed a telegram advocating that the whole country surrender to China according to the Konoe Declaration, attempting to confuse the world's vision, shake the confidence of the whole country in the war of resistance, and undermine the future of the war of resistance and nation-building. However, the local soldiers understood the people's will, and the national public opinion unanimously attacked him. The central government resolved to expel Wang from the party and dismiss him from his duties. Han has since lost his support for attracting and deceiving people and has completely become a traitor. After Wang's betrayal, the prestige of the central government has been further enhanced, the Kuomintang is more united, more progressive, more revolutionary, and closer to the Communist Party, so the anti-Japanese united front is more consolidated and expanded, the national league organization is easier to succeed, China's diplomatic path is more correct (the German-Italian path is cut off), and there is more flight progress in politics and military affairs. Now the twelve military regions of the country have been completely established, and the commanders-in-chief of the special military regions in Hebei, Chahar, Shandong, Jiangsu, Jiangnan and Jiangbei have also been appointed. In addition, the reform of political machinery, the development of wartime economy, the acceleration of transportation construction, and even the preparation for the establishment of the government of the four northeastern provinces have all been seen in practice!

War Situation in the Past Week

Following the great progress of military and political affairs, the overall war situation in the first two weeks of the year also symbolizes that 1939 will be a year in which we will dramatically move towards victory. In Central China, Yuan Liang first reported the great victory of Nanyang, killing hundreds of people and capturing more than a thousand guns; now the Xiang-E-Gan-Zhao army has changed its offensive and is actively engaged. In Jiang-Xi-E-Yu-Wan, our army has recently launched guerrilla counter-offensives, moving the original front line from Xinyang to Hefei, hundreds of miles behind, and recapturing a large area of land near Luohe, Huangchuan, Gushi, and Lihuang. In South China, the Southwest Headquarters is actively deploying active and comprehensive warfare under the leadership of Director Bai. Although the coastal areas in southwestern Guangdong have been blockaded, the Guangxi war has been completed, the Nanhai guerrillas have developed, the plans for Guangdong have not dared to go lightly, and the northeast and two routes, our army has won consecutive victories, and now Zengcheng has become a siege, and Conghua has been recaptured again. The army is forced to defend Guangzhou to the death. Along the Yellow River in North China, the war has become tense. Jin Province has lost Jixian, and the army has gathered in northern Henan. However, the 40,000-strong army launched on January 25th launched a three-pronged westward invasion, and was wiped out by us this week. One-third of the army was annihilated: on the contrary, after our Jin-Ji-Cha border area divine army Hou, the central army on the Yellow River was in battle, and it was not easy for the army to invade westward and southward. What is particularly worthy of attention is the guerrilla warfare in the occupied areas, which has now become a major strategy. Various places have launched attacks, such as counter-attacking Hangzhou, Nanjing, Wuhan, and the Eighth Route Army going deep into Liaoning and Rehe. Although it is still a period of preparation before the war, the conditions for victory are already in our hands.

Changes in the Japanese Cabinet

The Japanese army's encounter with serious difficulties in invading China is not only due to the dispersion and lack of military strength caused by the extended front line and the expanded war zone and the obstruction of terrain and transportation: at the same time, there are also (1) the resistance of guerrillas and the people encountered in the rule and development of the occupied areas; (2) the war-weariness, anti-war and rebellion in the army have spread from the puppet army to the entire Japanese officers and soldiers in Taiwan and Korea; (3) the financial and economic crisis is serious, the huge budget is difficult to pass, and the implementation of the general mobilization law is not easy; (4) the development of the "New Order in East Asia" has increased its collisions with the European and American powers, and Japan's international position is more isolated. And the rapid war and quick decision strategy of the Sino-Japanese system has been severely hit by the exposure of Wang Jingwei's surrender plan. These new factors have accelerated the internal contradictions in Japan, and the Konoe cabinet has fallen in this way. The Hiranuma cabinet was established on the 5th, but other than "giving a new look," it has no new significance, and in order to step up the dangerous aggression in order to find a way out, it has to use greater force to promote the general mobilization law and pass a huge budget. This will continue to invade China and establish a "new order" in East Asia, which will inevitably increase its unfavorable situation in the international arena. And the anti-fascist aggression movement of the people's front at home will inevitably become more impassioned.

Activities of Germany and Italy

Just as the oriental fascist aggressors cannot save their crisis and satisfy their appetite by occupying cities and seizing land, the western fascist aggressors, Germany and Italy, are also experiencing a sharp increase in their own crises, especially economic difficulties and the people's front anti-aggression movement. Germany has recently been vigorously engaged in party prisons, slashing and killing dissidents, and those who have been killed are all high-ranking military officers and generals. Hitler has to expand foreign warfare to prevent the outbreak of a domestic revolution, which can be understood from his New Year's Day declaration; at the same time, he is also committed to economic policies, asking Britain and other countries for help (note that Norman, the governor of the Bank of England, went to Germany on the 4th), while preparing to seize markets in the Middle East and Asia. The recent loan negotiations with Turkey are one example. As for Italy, on the day when the British-Italian negotiations are about to begin, its arrogance is even more arrogant. While the Wei army attacking the Spanish Republican government continues to advance, the slogan of reaching the port of Gibraltar is still flying high, and the situation in North Africa is urgent, especially today!

The Spanish War Intensifies

After the two-fascist aggressors of Italy and Germany succeeded in bullying at the Munich Conference, they not only did not slow down their aggression against Spain, but increased their courage. Especially Italy, which is even competing with Germany's eastward advance. From Christmas Day, it launched a large-scale attack on the Catalonia region. However, the Spanish People's Republican government has strengthened and grown stronger in the past half year of heroic struggle! Internally, it has always adhered to the anti-fascist people's front, united the Communist Party and all progressive parties, and externally adhered to the peace front, obtaining spiritual and material assistance from the Soviet Union and other countries (the United States has recently resolutely opposed recognizing the rebel army as a belligerent group, and the Soviet Union has always faithfully assisted the Spanish government). For the large-scale offensives launched by the two fascists in the past two years, they have not only met them head-on, but also implemented a comprehensive counter-offensive on the side of Ji. When the news came this week, they had already broken the joint offensive plan of the German and Italian combat aircraft, and the rebels suffered heavy losses and were forced to retreat. The losses were numerous!

Progress in US Policy

One side is the increasing difficulties of the aggression front and its most desperate arrogance. The other side is the tighter and more developed peace front. Regarding the former, a brief description is given above; regarding the latter, what is particularly noteworthy is that US policy is progressing under the threat of fascist aggressors! President Roosevelt said in Congress on the 4th that he had severely criticized the fascist countries for expanding the war and threatening the world, threatening the religions, democracy and international integrity that the United States cannot do without. Roosevelt also loudly called out: If the United States wants freedom, happiness and to fulfill its due mission to mankind, it must not hesitate to make any sacrifices to use armed sanctions to punish fascist aggression. As a result, the slogans of revising the current US foreign policy, national defense plan and neutrality law, and the voices of the US about to implement economic sanctions against Japan and Germany immediately spread across the globe. We should recognize that the advancement of US policy is not the means of the Soviet Union, nor is it the inclination of war leaders such as Roosevelt; but it is the fact that fascist aggression has actually threatened and harmed the Americans! The situation in the Far East is enough to make it clear! Therefore, even if a few arms dealers object, their power has been limited, and they will be taught by facts sooner or later!

New Trends in Britain, the United States, France and the Soviet Union

Although the US government's policy of maintaining human harmony and progress has not yet actually united the peace and democracy countries, its success in the Americas and its unanimous support from world public opinion are at least a new stimulus to Britain and France, which are burying themselves in the security agreement policy. Recognizing that there is still a way to go beyond compromise! Moreover, the progress of the anti-compromise movement of the people of Britain and France, especially the labor community, has further stimulated the governments of the two countries! As a result, following Roosevelt's speech, British Prime Minister Chamberlain declared on the 5th that he agreed with Roosevelt's proposal, coupled with Britain's economic needs to increase national defense, and the movement for British-American cooperation is now smoothly under way. Under the national anti-compromise policy movement in France, the Socialist Party unanimously resolved to oppose compromise and increase French-Soviet cooperation, and Daladier had no choice but to tour North Africa, officially declaring that he would fight to defend the motherland. As for the Soviet Union, it is recently continuing to increase its relations with countries such as Poland, and Soviet-American relations are particularly close; on the Far East, since the establishment of British-American loans to China, the aid work has been even more enthusiastic, and the tough attitude shown in the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement has made progressive people in the righteous cause excited. The 23rd of next month is the 21st anniversary of the Red Army. The Red Army of the entire Federation will swear to defend the motherland, defend peace and oppose fascist aggression, which should be a greater comfort and encouragement to our country's Spanish soldiers who are bravely resisting the war.

The times are always moving forward, and new facts further prove that the world is also moving forward! However, it is still a dark period when the dawn is just breaking. We still have many dangers and clouds ahead. We must be more vigilant and more courageous, and advance towards a bright and victorious future. Look, we have friendly forces on all sides!

### Guilin Under Fire

— Zheng Zhangqun

(Special Correspondent for this newspaper in Guilin)

News of the military situation becoming critical near Yueyang is published in the newspapers every day. Following this was the great fire in Changsha. The tense atmosphere in Guilin? Gradually revealed an air of panic. Refugees flowing in from the Weiyang area were like a tidal wave. However, due to vehicles and other reasons, the number of people who could evacuate was extremely limited. Therefore, Guilin’s streets suddenly became gathering places for refugees.

Many organizations from Wuhan, Changsha, and Hengyang have successively concentrated in Guilin. Watching Guilin gradually become the center of our political, military, and cultural affairs, based on past experience, this is the prelude to enemy planes coming to bomb us.

Although Guilin has natural and extremely safe air-raid shelters, most of Guilin's houses are made of wood and cannot withstand burning. Even if lives are kept safe, if, unfortunately, houses are destroyed, the problem of food and shelter is also worth considering. Therefore, most of the population is leaving Guilin, but what about transportation!

"Unfortunately, what was said came true." Worries finally became reality. On November 19th and 20th, two consecutive days of air-raid alerts disturbed the peaceful Guilin, which can be counted as a phenomenon not seen in forty days. Before these forty days, Guilin had experienced several air-raid alerts and one small-scale air raid. The citizens of Guilin should have had some experience in evacuation. Furthermore, the alerts in Guilin had two special characteristics: (1) The time was almost fixed from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. (2) Because there were many natural air-raid shelters, the people seeking refuge showed no signs of panic. As soon as the alert sounded, the citizens of Guilin moved in an orderly fashion toward the designated areas. Therefore, what was reflected in our eyes was a refuge procession that absolutely maintained order.

The two days of alerts came to nothing. What followed was the all-clear signal. Everyone felt that the air-raid alerts in Guilin were not worth worrying about. The previous small-scale air raid was simply "like a fart." However, on the third day, namely November 21st, at 10:00 AM, the "woo, woo..." sound spread from the top of Duxiu Peak to the entire city. People taking advantage of the alert time to enjoy outdoor activities carried food and went in the direction they wished to go. People who estimated that there would be no further developments after the alert simply did not leave their homes. However, less than ten minutes after the first alert was issued, an emergency alert came. It seemed like an unexpected blow, and the crowd seeking refuge had to change from walking to running. At that time, we left Nandou and did not reach Yankou. Just as we arrived near Yuan, twenty-seven enemy planes, lined up in three formations, appeared over Guilin from the east. Ball-like anti-aircraft guns fired at the enemy planes from the vicinity of Guilin. The rumbling sound echoed in the dome of the sky. The so-called thunderous explosion perhaps describes this phenomenon.

Unfortunately, "the range is too low," "the aim is very accurate!" such voices were heard among the refugees everywhere. The sound of enemy planes dropping bombs was also heard. At this moment, one of the twenty-seven planes emitted black smoke and red flames. The refugees burst into cheers, followed by applause. Tens of thousands of people looked up. In an instant, the enemy planes fled toward the east. An hour and a half later, the all-clear signal was given. After investigation, the enemy planes dropped more than ten bombs on Guilin this time. One landed on the open space between the Provincial Government and the library, one landed on the open space behind the court, and one hit a certain mansion near the North Gate, destroying over a hundred civilian houses. One person died (because they didn't evacuate and was killed instantly), and over ten people were injured. This was the first loss Guilin suffered from enemy plane bombing. However, we shot down two enemy planes. Some say one was shot down and one was damaged. In short, everyone felt it was "worth it."

The air defense work in Guilin is particularly good and developed.

In terms of equipment, there are natural caves that do not require manpower, towering dozens of feet high, with extremely good ventilation. These magnificent caves are everywhere around Guilin. The Seven Star Cave, Dragon Hidden Cave, White Dragon Cave, Lao Jun Cave, etc., these few caves alone can accommodate all the citizens of Guilin. These caves are scattered everywhere, allowing citizens to take refuge nearby, truly serving as ideal and safest air-raid shelters.

In terms of guiding evacuations, the Guangxi authorities have made their greatest efforts. If you live in a certain lane, there are signs at the entrance and exit of the lane instructing you where to go when you hear the alert. If you follow the signs, you can find a place to take refuge within five or ten minutes. When an alert comes, the citizens can evacuate in a very orderly manner. The authorities' efforts are truly immense. Elsewhere, on the roads and in open spaces, we can always see many square Guilin maps, circled in red, indicating where the residents of a certain area should evacuate to. No matter if you are new to Guilin or walking on any street, you can always find a suitable and safe refuge place.

However, Guilin has mostly wooden houses. Although there are safe air-raid shelters, escaping is always fraught with anxiety. Since there is no full confidence in effectively preventing enemy planes from invading, the danger of enemy planes dropping bombs and causing fires is still difficult to avoid. The reason why people in Guilin are still afraid of air raids lies here.

After a week of living without air-raid alerts, on the morning of November 28th, the "woo, woo" alert sound filled the entire city again. The chaotic evacuation scene from "The Great Earth" reappeared before our eyes. The series of events—alert, evacuation, bombing—continued for a week in Guilin, turning the landscape hailed as the best under heaven into rubble and scorched earth. The stable morale could not help but be shaken.

On November 30th, the alert sounded as usual. The "leisurely" attitude of the crowd evacuating seemed to have diminished much compared to the past. Soon, the second alert came. Forty-nine enemy planes then appeared in the blue sky over Guilin. Although our anti-aircraft artillery continued to fire, the planes did not reduce their violent actions. This time, the enemy planes dropped a total of sixty-five incendiary bombs and fifty-eight explosive bombs, all of which landed in the city. As a result, 181 houses were burned down and 318 were destroyed by explosions. Forty-two people died, thirty-eight were seriously injured, and 137 were slightly injured. The fire burned until 2:00 AM when rain finally extinguished it, a truly tragic sight. The reason why so many people were killed and injured this time was that outsiders were too accustomed to living through air-raid alerts. Although they heard the alert, they refused to evacuate, thus suffering disaster.

On December 1st, five enemy planes again circled in the air over Guilin for twenty minutes before leaving.

On December 2nd, at 10:00 AM, thirty-one enemy planes frantically bombed Guilin, dropping over eighty incendiary bombs and seventy explosive bombs, all of which landed in the city, destroying over two hundred and eighty houses and killing or injuring dozens of people.

From November 28th to December 4th, the entire week was a disaster unlike any Guilin had suffered in its history. After this week of frantic bombing, Guilin, famous for its beautiful mountains and rivers, was burned to ashes for one-fifth of the city. The prosperous streets were turned into scorched earth. The desolation was overwhelming and deeply regrettable. However, morale was still relatively stable, and order was maintained. This is the beautiful result of the Guangxi authorities' continuous efforts. Regarding these, we need to learn from Guangxi. We feel that the Guangxi spirit needs to be greatly advocated. The slogans "We will resist to the end!" and "Swear to avenge this!" spread throughout Guilin and Guangxi. We believe that this kind of slogan will soon spread throughout China and become the unanimous demand of all of China.

Due to the enemy planes' frantic bombing of Guilin this time, we have gained many valuable experiences. The following points are listed to serve as a reference for future air defense.

(1) Mandatory evacuation is necessary. With Guilin having such complete natural air-raid shelters and thorough organization, no one should be killed or injured during air raids. However, in reality, there are still many victims. The reason lies entirely in "underestimating the enemy." As long as people obediently evacuate according to plan, they will absolutely not be sacrificed in that way. After the first frantic bombing, everyone seemed to be a little more cautious. The second frantic bombing was later than the first time, but the losses were relatively less severe, the reason being this. We hope that the Guangxi authorities and those responsible for air defense nationwide will pay close attention.

(2) Strengthen fire-fighting equipment. Most major cities in the interior are built with wood, which cannot withstand burning, which is self-evident. If there are fire engines or a relatively complete fire brigade organization, many losses can be reduced, and the burning does not have to wait for heavy rain to extinguish.

(3) There must be a rescue organization. As a result of the frantic bombing, most are injured. Because of the lack of doctors and medicine, the injured are left to die, and there is nothing more tragic than this. Judging from the reality in Guilin, if there is a more complete rescue organization, deaths can be reduced.

(4) Intensify publicity efforts. Some say that after the war of resistance, the enemy's brutality and frantic bombing have already publicized for us. This view is absolutely wrong. We need to grasp the facts and explain the enemy's atrocities to the people, awakening them to a correct understanding of the enemy. It must also be pointed out that national mobilization is necessary to resist the enemy, and resisting the enemy is necessary to build the nation and be human... At the same time, the enemy's atrocities must be publicized internationally, hoping that justice and righteousness will be upheld.

(5) Step up organization. It is necessary to organize the people who witness the enemy's atrocities and have them participate in various salvation activities. Only they can actively participate in the work of resisting the enemy and saving the nation. As for guiding evacuations, fire-fighting, rescue, and other tasks, it is especially necessary for them to complete them. I believe that the people who have been propagandized and organized by us will be able to do their utmost to protect their homeland and defend their country.

### Guangdong Develops Wartime Construction; Expands Transportation Network to Facilitate Military Transport; Plans to Establish Southwest Economic Guangdong Branch

[Lian County Express News] The central military authorities, in order to consolidate the long-term war of resistance front, actively unblock the southwest international transportation routes, and develop the natural resources of the six provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Guangxi, and promote the export of local goods. They allocated 30 million national currency to supplement construction funding and established the Southwest Economic Construction Committee to oversee everything. Guangdong has newly appointed Chairman Li Hanhun, Director Gu Qun, Director Wang Taiyu, and others as members, and ordered the establishment of a Guangdong branch of the Southwest Economic Construction Committee in Guangdong, with branches established in various counties to actively promote the plan. Chairman Li, Director Gu, Director Wang, and others have convened meetings of economic construction, agriculture, and mining experts to discuss and decide to follow the central government's economic construction program, to plan methods for opening up wartime finance in Guangdong, to develop the wartime economy, and to promote foreign trade and revitalize agriculture, industry, and commerce.

Financial and Economic Consolidation Measures

Regarding the consolidation and development of wartime finance and economy in Guangdong, sources from the Finance Department revealed the following: (1) Minimize administrative expenses in the province, abolish various superfluous organizations; (2) Divide national and provincial taxes into separate systems to increase tax revenues; (3) Actively protect various wartime agricultural, industrial, and commercial enterprises; (4) Consolidate foreign exchange and adjust foreign trade; (5) Encourage the production and sale of local goods and reduce export tax rates; (6) Strengthen the financial center of the province. The financial centers of the southwest were originally in Changsha and Guangzhou. Since the fall of Guangzhou, Guangdong's financial center has invisibly shifted to Hong Kong. Measures should be taken to transfer it to the inland. Therefore, the new Director of Finance Gu Qun attaches particular importance to this.

Developing Wartime Transportation

Regarding the plan to develop wartime transportation in Guangdong, the focus is on building wartime highways and railways to connect Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other places, connecting to the international routes of Burma and Vietnam, and developing the natural resources, farmland, and water conservancy industries of Guangdong. Guangdong's highways that connect with the southwest include: (1) The Hong Kong-Hubei line, from Kowloon and Shenzhen to Wuchang, with a length of 1,335 kilometers; (2) The Guangdong-Dian line, from Shaoguan to Nanchang, connecting to the Jiangxi-Yunnan line and reaching Kunming, with a length of 2,700 kilometers; (3) The Guangdong-Gui line, from Sanshui to Huaiji in Guangxi Province; (4) The Qin-Yong line, from Qinzhou to Nanning, all of which have been connected. Since the outbreak of the war in Guangdong, the main and branch lines of the highways east of Guangzhou have been destroyed by the enemy, and the rest have been largely destroyed voluntarily. It has now been decided to establish a maintenance and restoration plan, focusing on the provincial and national roads connecting with Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei to continue supporting the transportation of military supplies and commercial goods. It has been reported that discussions and planning are underway with the authorities of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and the central Ministry of Communications.

### Merchants Fleeing Describe the Terrifying Situation in Guangzhou; The Market Is Desolate, Still Like a Dead City; The Enemy Army Fears Our Counterattack and Is Extremely Anxious

[Hong Kong News] The Guangzhou enemy authorities have recently been vigorously enticing our compatriots to return to the province. Many ignorant people have fallen for their schemes, but many have also rushed to leave after arriving in the province. A reporter spoke with merchants who had just arrived in Hong Kong from Guangzhou yesterday. According to them, they were doing business on Huiai Road in Guangzhou and fled in panic when the enemy army entered the city. Because the incident was sudden, they were unable to take any of their belongings. Recently, they attempted to sneak back to assess the situation, believing that order in Guangzhou was gradually being restored. Unexpectedly, upon entering the city, the situation they saw was still extremely terrifying. The atmosphere of killing and looting was natural. Nine out of ten houses in the city were empty and dilapidated. The entire city was desolate. Most shops and households were patronized by traitors and local thugs. Any items of slight value were robbed and plundered, even copper pots, iron stoves, door locks, copper nails, etc., were searched and taken away. At night, it became a world of demons and ghosts. Robbing and deception were rampant. Even a single stick could be used as a weapon for robbery. Recently, the enemy army in the city, hearing that our army has launched an attack on the foreign lines in Guangzhou, is extremely anxious. They have been busy setting up barbed wire and obstacles on various major thoroughfares and prohibiting pedestrians from passing through at night. Anyone deemed slightly suspicious is immediately arrested or killed on the spot. Many compatriots have been sacrificed in recent days. The enemy army's guard on the south side is particularly strict. Even during the day, they check pedestrians. Those deemed suspicious have no chance of survival. Therefore, many compatriots do not dare to return. Those who were deceived into returning are fleeing in panic and will not return again. The enemy army's recent propaganda stating that Guangzhou citizens are returning en masse is actually deceiving people. Not only have citizens not returned, but they are continuously leaving. Especially recently, as our army is besieging Guangzhou, and war is about to break out, the number of citizens fleeing is even deeper. Stores in the city have not resumed business even under duress. Although there are enemy ships traveling between Macau and Guangzhou, only traitors and local thugs use them. Seeing this situation, I felt it was impossible to stay any longer, so I hurriedly left Guangzhou to avoid being killed.

According to visitors from Shilong, since Shilong fell into enemy hands, compatriots in the city have been living inhuman lives. The situation is extremely miserable. Very few shops in the market are open, and the currency is extremely chaotic. Enemy army tickets, counterfeit coins, and enemy national banknotes are flooding the market, forcing citizens to use them. Those who refuse are killed on the spot. Recently, a butcher was killed by enemy soldiers for refusing to accept counterfeit money. The enemy soldiers also instigated villains to open opium dens and gambling houses to poison our people. Opium dens and gambling houses are everywhere in the city. Besides the original brothels that have reopened, there are also prostitutes from the enemy country who have come to China, but only enemy soldiers are allowed to patronize them. Order in the city is extremely chaotic. Robberies by enemy soldiers and villains occur several times a day. Shops that have not been watched by people have already been looted. Recently, our army launched a large-scale counterattack on the eastern front, and Boluo has been recovered. The enemy army in Shilong is in a panic and is forcing the people to build defensive works in the suburbs.

### The Dissolution of the Konoe Cabinet and the Prospects for the Hiranuma Cabinet (Continued from Page 8)

3. Konoe originally planned to issue a so-called "astonishing statement" on December 11 of last year, hoping to gain the support of Wang Zhaoming and others when the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee convened on December 15. However, due to the discovery of Wang's conspiracy, the Fifth Plenary Session was postponed. Konoe's good plan failed to materialize. As internal and external pressures urged him to issue the statement quickly, he was forced to issue it on December 22. By this time, Wang had already fled to Hanoi. Konoe's scheme to create chaos within the National Government and seize the opportunity to achieve peace, hoping to obtain war results, completely turned into a delusion. The trick of satisfying the insatiable demands of the military閥 also became a "dagger revealed after the map is unrolled." The plan to support the pond's use completely failed, and as a result, he had to bow his head and be driven by the military閥.

4. After the Imperial Conference, the contents of Konoe's new China policy, which he wanted to announce, were kept absolutely secret. When he met with the leaders of both houses of parliament, he briefly stated the statement he issued on December 22 and begged them not to leak the secrets. However, the heads of the various political parties hated the various brutal oppressions perpetrated by him over the past year and deliberately spread the news to the political editors of various newspapers in order to vent their anger. When Konoe learned of this, he discussed it with Chief Secretary Kazami and Vice Minister Matsuda and banned all newspapers from reporting it, and even any news relating to the preparation for issuing the statement was not allowed to be published. The political editors of various newspapers questioned Chief Secretary Kazami at the "Twenty-first Day Meeting" (i.e., the press corps of the Cabinet Information Department, attended by the political editors of various newspapers), demanding that he explain the reasons for banning the newspapers from publishing. Kazami refused to explain, and the two sides disagreed. Later, the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun disregarded everything and published a portion of the contents. The "Twenty-first Day Meeting" also resolved "not to take Konoe as an opponent." In other words, the newspapers had exerted themselves to support Konoe in the past, but Konoe had repaid the newspapers with pressure. Therefore, there was no need to continue supporting him. When the resolution was delivered to Konoe, he did not announce the reasons for working with Wang Zhaoming to plan and carry out his schemes. The newspapers were therefore even more resentful and prepared to unite with the political parties to launch an attack on him. Although he suppressed freedom of speech and the political parties suffered the consequences, Konoe, as Prime Minister, could not escape his responsibility. As Japan's national fortune gradually fell into darkness, the person in power also faced step by step of thorns. It is difficult to obtain the support of the public opinion. This is also one of the reasons why Konoe had to resign.

5. The British army's attitude turned tough, and lending to China, Wang Zhaoming's attempt also failed. The National Government's resistance force is becoming increasingly strong, and Japan is in a difficult situation where it wants to fight but cannot, and it wants to stop but cannot. The young and middle-aged factions then "xxxxxxxxxxxx" fabricated that the ten soldiers on the front line demanded to expand the war, reorganize the cabinet, unify the central government, and strengthen the cabinet and other slogans, forcing the status quo maintainers to leave.

6. Konoe originally wanted to engage in reorganization, asking Ikeda and Matsuda to resign, as a final struggle. Ikeda was happy to leave, while Matsuda was still unwilling to go, causing the reorganization to fail. He had no choice but to take the path of a general resignation.

Looking at the above six points, we can know the reasons for the dissolution of the Konoe cabinet and the internal chaos in Japan. In addition, Hitler repeatedly requested the Japanese cabinet to strengthen itself in order to implement the fascist organization as a condition for further cooperation, which was also one of the indirect reasons for Konoe's resignation. According to a Reuters report from Berlin on the 5th, Germany seems extremely satisfied with the organization of the new Japanese cabinet; they believe that Hiranuma is a politically experienced person, and that Arita, who concluded the Anti-Comintern Pact, will continue to serve as foreign minister, which is also welcomed by them. From this, we can see that Hitler had some influence on the general resignation of the Japanese cabinet this time.

The Circumstances of Hiranuma's Cabinet Formation

We mentioned above that Konoe originally wanted to reorganize the cabinet. The elders, senior officials, and financial circles also hoped that Konoe's fourth reorganization would succeed, as a buffer between the conflicts between the financial circles and the military閥. However, because Interior Minister Matsuda stubbornly refused to leave, the two sides could not agree, and Konoe had to resign. Before resigning, Konoe had a long secret meeting with Hiranuma. According to Japanese law, there was no need to consult with the President of the Privy Council when the cabinet resigned. Konoe's meeting with Hiranuma at that time showed that he had decided to invite Hiranuma to form a cabinet. Konoe was unable to continue to support it. However, before Hiranuma formally started forming the cabinet, some people mistakenly thought that Konoe would continue to form the cabinet, which was a big mistake. As a result of the meeting between Konoe and Hiranuma, it was decided to implement a transitional period method, and Zhong Shao also formed the cabinet. However, in order to avoid international recognition that Japan had become a fascist dictatorship, which would cause more diplomatic pressure, and to leave room for negotiating peace with China, and to reduce the obstacles to the organization of the new cabinet, Ikeda and Matsuda were chosen, and in terms of political parties, Miyo Maeda of the Seiyukai Party and Yukio Sakurauchi of the 　Party (originally recommended Tian, but he refused) were selected to enter the cabinet, and the rest were re-elected. This move was intended to make China and the outside world believe that the Hiranuma Cabinet was a continuation of the Konoe Cabinet.

Minister of Health and Welfare Kido was originally one of the three giants of the National Reorganization Movement, but because he had deep ties with the former senior officials and nobles, in order to ease the conflict between the military and financial circles, he was transferred from the Ministry of Health and Welfare to the Interior Minister. The reason why Vice Minister Ishikawa jumped to become Minister of Finance is the same as the reason why former Minister Kaya was promoted. Ishikawa is a financial expert with a good reputation in Japan. Everything can only obey the orders of the military, and it is easy to command him. As the date for the Japanese Parliament to reconvene is approaching, it is most appropriate to promote him to Minister of Finance for the convenience of answering parliamentary questions. This is a major reason for his promotion. However, Japan's budget for this year, including war expenses and local expenditures, requires about 1.2 billion yuan, and its finances have reached the point where they are exhausted. "It is difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice," and the increase in military spending is endless. How can Ishikawa cope? As a result, he will inevitably fall into the same fate as former Prime Minister Kaya. As for Arita, he was originally a diplomatic expert of the pro-American faction. At present, Japan's diplomacy with China is in the hands of the Xingya Academy, which is run by "Japanese gangsters." The Foreign Ministry has no room to intervene, so Arita was able to stay on to specialize in European and American diplomacy. This move is both intended to show that the Hiranuma Cabinet is a continuation of the Konoe Cabinet, and to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact, with the intention of having it become one of the signatories to the Anti-Comintern Pact.

Konoe remains Minister without Portfolio. What is the reason? According to our observations, there are three reasons: (1) Continue to work with Wang to seek the Sino-Japanese compromise he dreamed of, to put it bluntly, to achieve the goal of forcing China to submit; (2) To ease the conflict between the military and financial circles, the military and financial circles have reached the point of close contact, and the struggle will be even more fierce. Therefore, Konoe has to reluctantly act as a shield: (3) To show that the new cabinet is a cabinet of Japanese senior officials, and to show that it is a cabinet of national unity, in order to deceive at home and abroad. In reality, it can only deceive within the country.

Based on the above, we can know that the Hiranuma Cabinet has been a weak cabinet since its birth. It is fortunate that it did not die in the womb and underwent surgery. It is really worrying if it wants to grow up!

### Chen Youren Denies Taking the Post of Foreign Minister, Absolutely Opposes Peace Negotiations with the Japanese, and Demands That the Government Thoroughly Eliminate Traitors

[Special Interview by Our Newspaper] In recent days, various newspapers have widely reported that Chen Youren will take the post of Foreign Minister. A certain news agency has also issued a message stating that Mr. Chen has expressed his willingness to take on the difficult task and stated that after meeting with Wang Jingwei, he will issue important opinions on the current situation. The reporter felt that this news was clearly contradictory, so he went to visit Mr. Chen to inquire about the truth. Mr. Chen gave the following statement:

Mr. Chen said: "I absolutely refute the message issued by a certain news agency regarding my statement that I intend to meet with Wang Jingwei. Not only do I absolutely not have the intention of meeting with Wang Jingwei, I also absolutely did not make any similar statement to anyone or any reporter. My attitude against peace negotiations is known to the world. Not only do I absolutely oppose any individual or political group attempting to negotiate peace with the Japanese, but I also demand that the government thoroughly eliminate all elements advocating peace. The Sino-Japanese war has reached this point, and there is really nothing to negotiate. The Japanese government has repeatedly publicly declared that it is determined to establish a 'New Order in East Asia.' The so-called 'New Order in East Asia' is just a euphemism for annexing China and expanding the Japanese Empire. The Japanese aim is annexation. To negotiate peace with the Japanese is, in essence, no different from discussing our own funeral arrangements with the Japanese!"

"Regarding the news of my taking the post of Foreign Minister, there have been many rumors. Since my return from Europe, such news has been widely reported several times. This current rumor is just another example."

### British Munitions Are Constantly Being Transported to Our Country. News Released by the German Government Newspaper. The First Batch Will Arrive This Month.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Dispatch, 8th] Automobiles and all equipment purchased with the British credit loan are already being transported. If there are no obstacles, the first batch will arrive this month. Our foreign transportation routes will be clear from then on.

[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] Today, the German Propaganda Ministry newspaper "Der Angriff" ("The Attack") claimed on its front page, "Japan has now blockaded British positions in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou." Britain is now turning to the rear, extending into China via Rangoon. The newspaper claimed, "The main purpose of Britain's recent loans to China is for this." The newspaper's Rangoon correspondent reported that British ships loaded with munitions have arrived in Rangoon for import into China. The first shipment of munitions to China includes twenty light trucks. The correspondent acknowledged that Japanese bombing of wharves and Yunnan is difficult, due to the mountainous terrain and climate that hinders flight. The newspaper added that this new development is not a revolution in the Far Eastern situation, but it opens a new page in the Sino-Japanese War.

[Special Air Mail Report from Kunming] The Yunnan-Burma Road has long been open to traffic, but it relies on truck transportation, which is ultimately inconvenient. Therefore, in June of last year, the Central Government ordered the organization of the Yunnan-Burma Railway Bureau, and surveying began in July. Subsequently, an order was issued to build the Kunming-Xufu (Suifu) Railway, extending the Yunnan-Burma Road to Sichuan Province. Currently, the surveying work for both routes has been completed. For the initial survey work, the Yunnan-Burma Railway is 45% complete, and the Xufu-Kunming Railway is 20% complete. For the alignment work, the Yunnan-Burma Road is 20% complete, and the Xufu-Kunming Railway is 15% complete. It is expected that the entire project will be completed by the end of March this year. The main lines of the two routes are planned to be 773 kilometers for the Yunnan-Burma Road and 774 kilometers for the Xufu-Kunming Road. The Yunnan-Burma Road passes through Anning, Lufeng, Guangtong, Chuxiong, Zhennan, Yaoan, Yunnanyi, Didu, Nanjian, Yunji, Mengwan, and Mengding to reach Nandai. The Xufu-Kunming Road passes through Malong, Qujing, Yiwei, Weining, Jianjin, to reach Xufu in Sichuan. There are as many as 150 tunnels on both routes. Therefore, the Railway Bureau has ordered thirty mountain-excavating machines from foreign countries, which will arrive within a few months. Most interestingly, in order to save foreign exchange, the bridges on both routes are making maximum use of rock, but their strength is no less than those made of cement and steel. The construction costs for both routes require two hundred million yuan. Sichuan and Yunnan provinces will each contribute five million, and the remainder will be allocated by the Central Government. A loan of two million pounds is required, and over one million pounds has already been raised.

### The Ministry of Economic Affairs Plans to Revitalize Relocated Heavy Industries in Sichuan. It Will Borrow 6 Million Yuan for This Purpose. The Sichuan-Guangxi Waterway Begins to Be Dredged.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Dispatch, 8th] The Ministry of Economic Affairs is making every effort to assist in the revitalization of the heavy industries relocated to Sichuan in the interior. It will borrow 6 million yuan from banks for this specific purpose.

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Dispatch, 8th] The Sichuan-Guangxi waterway has begun to be dredged to facilitate wartime military transportation.

[Our Newspaper Kunming Dispatch, 8th] A reclamation committee has been established, with a general affairs group, an immigration group, and a reclamation group to take care of the relocation of refugees for reclamation.

### New Capital's New Year's Day

— Yu

[Continued Quick Dispatch from Chongqing by Our Newspaper Yesterday] In addition, representatives from the Central Party Headquarters' Social Affairs Department, the Chairman's Headquarters, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Anti-Japanese Support Association all explained the responsibilities they should assume in the war of resistance and national construction. In particular, the representative of the Social Affairs Department of the Central Party Headquarters gave a more detailed explanation of the significance of holding this conference.

The red sun set, and dusk arrived. The more than 50,000 people in the audience sang together, "Arise! Arise! Arise! We are united as one, braving the Japanese guns, advance! Advance!..." shaking the heavens and the earth!

The lantern parade then began. Thousands of people flocked to see the lanterns. The national flag of the Kuomintang led the way, flanked by two large kerosene torches, followed by the Anti-Japanese National Construction March and its prelude. Then, the entire Seven-Seven Children's Troupe sang patriotic songs along the way, harmonizing with the music of the government band. A group of representatives from the Drama Association proceeded with torches, followed by a batch of children's propaganda troupes. The Li family troupe and the Han Opera troupe performed three tiered formations and six horse-riding stunts, depicting Yue Wu Mu, Wen Tianxiang, and Liang Hongyu in battles against the Jin soldiers. Although these actors were made up, they were also filled with anti-Japanese significance. "Human Public *" was performed by the Roaring Drama Society, depicting the Japanese army's rape, pillage, and killing, creating an extremely realistic scene. "* Demon Dance" was jointly performed by the Anti-* Drama Troupe of the Headquarters Political Training Office and the Cuiwen Drama Troupe. It used a car to carry several traitors and puppets, who were tied up by a Japanese * with a rope. The traitors sought wealth, and the puppets sought official positions, becoming the Japanese's dogs. The scene was both pitiful and hateful. "Roar, China" was performed by the Seven-Seven Propaganda Team. A lion jumped and leaped along the way, exhausting a fake Japanese person playing with a sun ball. Before entering Tongyuan Gate, he put away his demon hands and asked someone to take his place, symbolizing the awakening lion's roar devouring the sun. "Fighting for Freedom and Peace" was performed by the Roaring Drama Society. An armored car carried a large United Nations cannon, which occasionally revealed flashes of light from its muzzle. The god of peace and freedom sat high on the cannon, indicating that China's resistance against Japan was for national liberation and for the freedom of the country. "Total National Mobilization" was performed by the Central Photography Studio. A sailboat, about three feet long, was pulled by twenty-eight people in front, and twenty-eight people paddled inside the boat. A white-bearded official stood at the stern, laboriously steering the boat uphill and downhill. However, through his calm promotion and the continuous efforts of most of the boatmen, this dangerous leaky boat safely completed its heavy task. "Final Victory" was performed by the National Drama School. Four people carried a triumphal archway. Several glorious women and strong men passed through the archway, indicating that China's resistance would surely achieve final victory. At the rear were the Ge Yu Drama Society and the South Bank Anti-* Support Association, singing the song "Long Live China" to celebrate China's longevity, with farmers, workers, students, soldiers, and village girls. In addition, lanterns with the words "Military-Civilian Cooperation" and "Support the War of Resistance" followed behind, long, square, round, flat... like countless stars in a summer night, with the sounds of singing, music, and slogans along the way blending together, the line winding for several miles, very lively, causing excitement among all the people in Xindu. Who didn't run out of their houses to watch their procession and listen to their songs, then turn back and excitedly say to their companions, "It's really good!" (January 2nd)

### Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi Send Telegram Denouncing Wang Jingwei and Urging the Central Government to Issue a Formal Arrest Warrant

[Our Newspaper Chongqing Dispatch, 8th] According to reliable sources, Wang Jingwei returned to Hanoi because of the poor public opinion in Hong Kong, fearing it would be detrimental to him. This matter has been confirmed by a telegram from Kunming. Many military and political leaders in various places advocate the arrest and punishment of Wang. It is said that the Central Government is not yet prepared to do so, but will take final action if Wang takes any further action.

[Central News Agency, Guilin Dispatch, 7th] To all party headquarters, mass organizations, revolutionary comrades, and compatriots at home and abroad, we report that Wang Zhaoming's betrayal of the party and the country and support for the Japanese has been punished by the Central Executive Committee with permanent expulsion from the party and the removal of all his positions, both substantive and concurrent, by the National Government. Now, the people of the country unanimously denounce him and vow to never coexist with this traitor. Our army has also urged the Central Government to issue a formal arrest warrant to maintain the nation's integrity and benefit the war of resistance. Respectfully submitted, Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi.

### The Collapse of the Konoe Cabinet and Prospects for the Hiranuma Cabinet

— Li Wanjü

Why the Konoe Cabinet Collapsed

The reasons why the Konoe Cabinet was bound to collapse were already analyzed and judged in detail in this newspaper's articles "The Truth About the Political Upheaval of the Japanese Cabinet" published on December 2nd of last year, "From the Privy Council's Questioning of Konoe to the Imperial Conference" on the 7th, and "Konoe Fumimaro's Political Illness" on the 15th. However, at the time, because foreign-run news agencies did not carry this information, most people regarded it lightly. Some even thought it was just alarmist talk and intentional rumors to achieve temporary satisfaction, and was completely unreliable. Now that the Konoe Cabinet has indeed collapsed, this is enough to prove that the predictions made in the above three articles have all come true. Konoe came to power in June 1937, and within a month, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred, resulting in the largest and longest war in the history of the Far East. He was a playboy, lacking both political experience and ambition, but with great ambitions. Although he outwardly advocated liberalism, he was actually a most reactionary figure. Therefore, when he came to power, some people judged that he would surely side with the warlords and launch an aggressive war against China. At the beginning of the war, he and the warlords shared the same illusion, believing that China could be conquered in a short period of two or three months at most, thus establishing an epoch-making feat for the Japanese Empire. Who knew that reality would shatter his dream? Therefore, the Japanese Minister of War stated in the 73rd Diet that the General Mobilization Law was aimed at Russia and not to be used in the Sino-Japanese War, but now he had to implement it in full. This was a fatal blow to the Konoe Cabinet. In addition, there were many other reasons involved, which are described below:

1.  In early November of last year, the Japanese government, feeling that the end of the Sino-Japanese War was nowhere in sight and that the financing of military expenses had become a major problem, prepared to implement Article 11 of the General Mobilization Law. At that time, Colonel Sato, the head of the intelligence department of the Army Ministry, even made threatening remarks, saying that most of the people were sacrificing their blood on the battlefield, and the "rear citizens," especially the capitalists, should not turn a blind eye. If the financial groups did not immediately repent, the government would decide to revise the entire new social structure, not just limiting profits. As a result, the stock market experienced a huge slump, and the financial world was in chaos. In the end, the military had to show a concession to the financial groups on the surface, allowing dividends not to exceed one percent (in fact, the annual dividend in Japan is only six percent), and at the same time transferred Sato to show goodwill. The reason why Sato made this statement was partly because the military expenses were not available and he was anxious, and partly because the Japanese wounded soldiers, the so-called "White-Clad Warriors," went to the Army Ministry in groups to petition for relief. The misery of the situation was beyond description. As a result, Sato suddenly realized his conscience and burst into tears on the spot! However, he did not ask what the root cause of the soldiers' deaths and injuries was, but instead put all the responsibility on the financial groups. This was one of the reasons why the Japanese warlords were eager to implement Article 11 of the General Mobilization Law, and it was also the reason why Sato was dismissed and Konoe had to collapse. The warlords' struggle against the financial groups failed, but their inner anger was self-evident. Therefore, they threatened the financial groups and political parties with the topic of "national reorganization," while Interior Minister Suetsugu demanded the dissolution of the Diet so that the organization of one party and one country could proceed smoothly. There were two ways they adopted the conspiracy: (1) After the military expenditure and budget for the next year were passed, they would propose a bill to reform the parliamentary system, adopt a large electoral district system, and authorize the prefectural governors to suppress the existing political parties; (2) They would propose a budget of 10 million yen for the national reorganization movement. This amount was exactly twice the annual budget of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties. The military planned to use this money to buy off the wavering elements of the two parties, causing them to split internally and disintegrate, and then create a new party. If the Seiyukai and Minseito parties raised some objections when the Diet was in session, they would dissolve the Diet to realize their dream of military dictatorship. This conspiracy was finally detected by the political parties. Public anger reached its peak, and they planned to question Suetsugu in the Diet. The trend of opposition to the government in all circles obviously expanded, and Konoe was also dissatisfied with Suetsugu's conspiracy. He originally planned to expel him from the cabinet during the reorganization, but the secret was leaked to Suetsugu's ears, and a direct confrontation occurred. This is the real reason why Suetsugu started the political turmoil. On the 3rd of this month, Reuters Tokyo reported that the main cause of the current political turmoil was said to be Interior Minister Suetsugu. Suetsugu was known for his tendency to fascism, and now he insisted on demanding a national mobilization of politics. If his plan were implemented, the existing political parties would have to merge into one, but the Minseito and Seiyukai parties resolutely opposed it. It was also heard that Suetsugu had threatened to dissolve the parliament. Therefore, Konoe resigned before the Diet session. This telegram describes the reasons for the collapse of the Konoe cabinet in more detail.

2.  On November 29th of last year, after Minister of War Itagaki met with Japanese munitions manufacturers, Vice Minister of the Army Tojo took the floor and said: "Japan must prepare munitions to fight against China and the Soviet Union at the same time," and stressed that war against the Soviet Union was inevitable. After this conversation reached Moscow, the Soviet people were quite agitated, which affected the continued signing of the Fisheries Treaty. At the same time, the Japanese people were already feeling overwhelmed by the war against China, so they were even more alarmed to hear that they wanted to fight against the Soviet Union again. The military had no choice but to transfer Vice Minister Tojo on December 10th during an army reorganization. This move caused people in all circles of Japan to gradually lose faith in Itagaki's prestige, but the War League maintained a tough attitude. When Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov met with Japanese Ambassador Togo on December 13th, he questioned: "Japanese Vice Minister of the Army Tojo openly declared that he was preparing for an anti-Soviet war, so the Soviet Union must change its fishing grounds in terms of military strategy." At present, the fishing agreement issue was negotiated again and rejected by the Soviet Union, and the prestige of the so-called first-class power plummeted. Should they back down? They had to save face. Should they be tough? The lesson of the Changkufeng Incident still made the Japanese warlords frightened, especially since there was no sign of resolving the military expenditure issue. However, the environment forced the Japanese warlords to dream of fighting against China and the Soviet Union at the same time, but this was what Finance Minister Ikeda, who knew that "oil cannot be squeezed out of green grass," most opposed. As a result, the conflict between the military and financial groups intensified, and the military's advocacy of expelling Ikeda gradually became more determined. Konoe was unable to let Ikeda retire, and found himself in a miserable situation of being unable to advance or retreat. However, the warlords were overbearing, forcing Konoe to have no room for mediation, and Ikeda had no choice but to leave. This was also one of the reasons for the collapse of the Konoe Cabinet.
