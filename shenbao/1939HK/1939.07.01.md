### Wang’s Treacherous Acts of Selling Out the Nation

According to a Tianjin dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 28th, Wang Zhao-ming has indeed arrived in Peiping on the 26th, traveling by plane from Shanghai via Tianjin. Wang’s purpose in going to Peiping is to discuss with the Peiping traitors how to organize a puppet federal government. According to Shanghai news, Wang Kemin had previously sent people to Shanghai to discuss the formation of a puppet central government with the Wang faction. In the middle of this month, a group of traitors also held a meeting in Shanghai, with representatives from the two puppet organizations in Peiping and Nanjing, as well as the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, also participating. Therefore, Wang's trip to Peiping seems reliable. A Reuters dispatch further stated: "The Japanese are now preparing to issue a declaration on the second anniversary of the 'July 7th' Sino-Japanese War, organizing a puppet central government in the form of a federation. It is conceivable that the group of traitors and the Japanese warlords are eager to resolve the Sino-Japanese War through political means."

We observe the situation from all sides. The reasons why the Japanese are in a hurry to establish a puppet central government are probably no more than the following: First, the Japanese army has besieged the British in Tianjin and has already obtained a certain degree of concession from the British in an intangible way. Now, the local incident has been moved to Tokyo for negotiations. Japan naturally cannot let go of this opportunity and quickly create a powerful and concrete so-called "fait accompli" to deceive the current British government authorities, bargain, and ×××× accept the unreasonable demands of the Japanese side. Second, the Japanese military authorities have also realized that they cannot end the Sino-Japanese War by military force alone and save themselves from being trapped deeper and deeper. At the beginning of June, Hitler warned the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Oshima: Japan's losses in the war of aggression against China are considerable and cannot be recovered without seven or eight years of long-term recuperation. Itagaki and other army leaders were certainly very frustrated upon hearing this news, but the facts still speak louder than eloquence. Therefore, even the military department had to cancel its initial opposition to using Wang. Third, since the Japanese side attaches greater importance to the role of political conspiracy than to military power, then it is necessary to choose a deceptive figure to use traitors. Wang was once an important figure in the Kuomintang and held an important position in the National Government. He also occupied a position in the past Chinese revolutionary history. Wang's conditions best meet the requirements of the Japanese side. It is heard that the Japanese side has agreed to several firm demands of Wang: First, to establish a puppet central government in Nanjing and make the two puppet organizations in Peiping and Ningxia local governments: Second, the national emblem proposed by Wang, which is the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Five-Colored Flag. These facts are not accidental.

Wang's coming to the stage, like a monkey wearing a hat, playing the role of the chief culprit of the puppet regime, is probably not a problem. However, Wang's crimes will be substantiated by this performance, ××××××××××. The National Government has formally issued a strict order to arrest him, calling him a "traitor." Condemnations from all sides are flying in like snowflakes. Today, Wang is not only betraying the Republic of China, but also harming the people of the whole country. In addition to the explicit arrest warrant issued by the National Government, "all of our people in the country should criticize Wang verbally and in writing, and it is right to do so at this time" (words of Long Yun, governor of the province). ××××××××, it will not fail to make one a Chinese national hero, and in the annals of history it will be immortal alongside Yue Wu Mu!

### On Guerrilla Warfare on the Plains

— Zhou Shiti

Already, night combat, the plains are suitable for night activities, night activities can also reduce the effectiveness of ×'s technology, since our war of resistance, we have carried out many night battles, and have achieved many victories, we must promote the experience of night battles, and take more night activities and battles, but night activities also have many weaknesses, such as it is not easy for commanders to grasp the troops, it is easy to lose contact, communication is difficult to be thorough, so misunderstandings are inevitable, × people stubbornly defend houses, it is not easy to overcome, and troops are prone to panic, etc., which is something that needs special attention to overcome in night warfare, on November 13, our ×× regiment encountered × at Huashipian at night, we were able to quickly attack × people, × people's artillery could not be used, and tried to retreat to the village to hold on, but the second battalion of our ×× regiment quickly occupied the village, although some of the × people had already entered the village, but under the fierce attack of our grenades, × people could not occupy it, had no way to escape, and were mostly annihilated by us, the experience of this night battle is that the × situation and terrain were scouted very clearly, the movements were also very rapid and resolute, and the communication and command were good, which is worth learning in the future,

Noon, the terrain of the plains is open, even a single blade of grass, a small ditch or a low ridge has great value, and special attention should be paid to using them in battle, and using a low posture, which is very important,

Not yet, in peacetime combat, it is necessary to estimate that × people's reinforcements are faster than in mountainous areas, so the vigilance during combat must be strengthened in the main areas, to be able to guarantee that the main force solves the battle, at the same time, the plains have convenient transportation, and × people can detour to our rear, so it is necessary to leave a necessary reserve force, (when ambushing in mountainous areas, we often only pay attention to the vigilance on both sides and do not pay attention to the rear vigilance, which is also wrong), in November, the second battalion of our ×× regiment won a complete victory in the ambush north of Gui Sui; however, × people reinforced from Wu Chuan, and after collapsing the guard platoon of mine in the temple, detoured to the rear of the second battalion, cutting off my return route, the rear of the second battalion had no vigilance, and responded hastily, unprepared, not only were all the spoils lost, but they also suffered losses themselves, which is a lesson,

(D) Reconnaissance

Child, at any time and space, all means should be used to conduct thorough reconnaissance, which is even more important on the plains, on the plains, the value of all terrain and features increases, the reconnaissance of terrain and roads is also important, and the reconnaissance of residents should not be relaxed,

Ugly, the means of reconnaissance on the plains are generally the same as in mountainous areas, and now only the means and methods that should be paid special attention to are put forward,

A, spies can get the news of × people as early as possible, this kind of reconnaissance should be strengthened, in each × people's station, we must find ways to dispatch them,

B, each unit, even small striking teams, should have their own scouts to constantly scout, and pay attention to night reconnaissance, otherwise, for example, when the ×× regiment was in Qingman Mountain, × people used cars to carry troops close to Qingman Mountain Regiment Park at night, because we could not observe it at night, we only knew when × started to attack at dawn, and suffered a little loss,

C, in addition to the main force dispatching reconnaissance, each guard unit (such as the outpost, platoon post, small post) should also send its own reconnaissance team, or 5-6 to more than 10 li in front of the guard area in the main direction, to conduct continuous reconnaissance in order to understand the situation as early as possible, which is very important, especially at night,

D, a strict reconnaissance network should be established in the area of operation, extending our reconnaissance to × people's stations and their vicinity, so that we can know every move of the × people in time,

The personnel in charge of the reconnaissance outline are mainly the people in the cities, towns and villages who are loyal to the cause of resistance, and sometimes the troops can also send people to take charge, no matter what kind of component is responsible for leading the reconnaissance troops, the reconnaissance outline personnel should be given the necessary reconnaissance education, and people should be sent to guide and inspect them frequently,

In addition to carrying out reconnaissance themselves, the reconnaissance network personnel should use reliable masses to help with reconnaissance,

E, on the plains, especially in areas close to × people, × people's reconnaissance troops and human scouts are also frequently active, so the disguise of reconnaissance is also important, such as the scouts of the first detachment, and even their workers, work in Yangqu, Jingyuan, Wenshui, and other Pingdi Jiaocheng, mostly wearing plain clothes and mixing in the crowd, sometimes also with the good citizen certificate issued by the × people, so even if the surroundings are × people, or encounter × people, there is no danger,

F, in addition to the troops themselves dispatching reconnaissance, it is necessary to mobilize the people to automatically report × information to us, such as the □□ regiment, when it was in Baijiazhuang last November, × people attacked from three routes and passed through the villages on the three routes, and the masses automatically came to report, so that my ×× regiment could deploy calmly, and recently, the company of the ×× regiment east of Yanmen sent a communication soldier to deliver a letter, and when they arrived at Laowo, they happened to encounter seven × people searching the village, the masses knew that the communication soldier was a member of our ×× army, and immediately reported it, and took the communication soldier to hide in the mountains, these examples are numerous, so the reconnaissance work relies on the strength of the residents, which is an exceptionally important part,

(E) Vigilance

No matter the size of the troops, and whether they are stationary or active, the vigilance must be strengthened and more reliable than in mountainous areas to ensure the safety of the main force, not to be attacked by ×, and to be able to deal with it calmly

(F) Communication

In plains marching and combat, the formation is wider and more dispersed than in mountainous areas, and at the same time, due to air defense considerations, the camping site may sometimes be dispersed in a larger area, and more reconnaissance guards are dispatched, so it is necessary to have a more thorough and reliable communication, the principles of communication are not much different from those in mountainous areas, in addition to using all our communication tools as much as possible, the following matters should be noted:

Child, communication on the plains is easy, and flag language and signs should be used more?

Ugly, strengthen cavalry communication,

Yin, establish bicycle communication?

Mao, establish communication in the masses, or use local government agencies, especially for units with few communication tools: but in order to be reliable and fast, it is still necessary to use one's own communication tools as much as possible (the use of government agencies and mass communication networks is limited to cases where one's own communication tools are insufficient and some unimportant and non-urgent matters),

(G) Dealing with ××'s attacks

The tactics of × people's attacks are indeed more advanced now than in the past, in the past winter and spring, × people's attacks on our army were still not sudden, and they followed the regular combat methods, "approaching deployment, firepower preparation, charging," such as the ×× regimental troops that attacked Bai Zhuang and Yang Jia Jing in November and December last year, but they have improved after April and May this year, and they often act at night, surround our station before dawn, cut off our army's road, do not fire guns, bypass our guard line, and suddenly launch a charge, making us caught off guard, such as the attack on my ×× independent battalion of Xin Ping in April, and the attack on the second battalion of my ×× regiment of Zhao Jia Yao in June, etc., and sometimes they also use pre-ambush on the roadside where our army often travels to carry out a sudden attack, such as after June and July, the Shuo County × often sent dozens of people in the villages and forests west and south of Shuo County to attack our guerrillas and capture our workers, and in November, the fifth company of my ×× regiment solved a unit of puppet troops in the plain south of Kebiqi, and obtained 40-50 war horses, Sheng He returned to the vicinity of Sidao Hezi north of Bikqi, because they did not pay attention to reconnaissance and vigilance, the victory was completely lost, since the war of resistance, all our units have been attacked by × more than 20 times in total, some of which were failures for the × people, and some of which were successes for the × people, after checking, the main reason for the success of the × people's attacks is not that the × people's attack technology has greatly improved, but that we do not understand the × people's tactics enough, we misjudge the × situation, our alertness is poor, and we do not pay attention to reconnaissance and vigilance,

According to Article 5 of the "Battlefield Education Materials" issued by Yamaguchi, the brigade commander of the × 109th Division: "To achieve great results against the × people who adopt guerrilla tactics, there is no other way but to use surprise attacks, therefore, the operation of small detachments using night maneuvers, acting bravely and boldly, deserves special commendation, and it is necessary to keep secrets and pay attention to camouflage," the fact is also true, such as the Jiaoye Battalion of the Kawazaki Regiment of the × 109th Division departed from Wutai at 8:00 pm on November 2, took a 60-li mountain road, to attack the □th Brigade of our Border Region in Hongkou Town, and after the attack, they marched back to Wutai on the night of the 3rd (Note: On the night of the 3rd, the × people returned to the vicinity of Huashi Pian, and were ambushed by a certain regiment of our army, and most of them were annihilated),

× people's attacks on our army are proactive, and × people believe that "there is no other way but to use surprise attacks," it can be seen that × people's attack actions are the main tactics against guerrilla troops, × people often force our army in mountainous areas, and in the plains, × people's actions to attack our army will inevitably increase, and the troops or guerrillas in the plains must pay close attention to our research to deal with × people's attacks, and now the methods and principles of dealing with × people's attacks are described as follows (to be continued)

### The Situation Along the Coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang is Increasingly Tense; Many of the Troops in the Yangtze River Region have been Transferred Elsewhere, Leaving the Actual Strength Empty; Intense Battles on the Northern Front, Our Army Wins Repeated Victories

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper Chongqing, 30th] Nearly 20,000 × near the Yangtze River have withdrawn from Hankou to Nanjing, and a part of the × in central Hubei has also withdrawn to Hankou. Currently, × is taking a defensive posture in Hubei. There are about 1,000 remaining × in Tianmen, and no more than 2,000 in the Jing Shan and Ying Shan areas. They have no ability to attack again. Our army is active along the Ping Han Railway, constantly cutting off transportation. Our guerrillas near Nanchang have repeatedly attacked ×, and at the old airfield, × planes have been blown up several times by landmines we planted, resulting in significant losses.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper Chongqing, 30th] Guerrilla warfare is very fierce in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu. About 6,000 × in Ju County, Mengyin, and Yishui are under our control. Fierce battles have been fought for days near Jicheng in southern Shanxi, killing 600-700 ×. 600-700 × from Zhangdian Houwang attacked my Su Han Village Junzhuang, but were repelled, suffering more than 100 casualties.

Fierce Fighting in Jieyang

[Continental News Agency Xingning Express News] × continues to attempt to attack Jieyang. On the Chaoan side, × claimed to attack west along the Chao Jie Highway, but it was actually a feint. × increased its troops and advanced from the west of Fuyang, and also gathered many shallow-water submarines at Guanbu. On the 28th and 29th, they sailed upstream along the tributaries of the Han River, attempting to encircle and attack the county seat, posing a great threat. Our main force has been divided to intercept them. General ××× is directing operations on the front lines. The Fourth War Zone Military Law Enforcement Supervisory Department has also dispatched senior inspectors to the front to supervise the execution of combat orders by various units. They passed through Xingning on the 28th and went to the front.

[Central News Agency Liuhuang, 29th] The ×× unit of our army that stubbornly defended the county seat of Chaoan charged out of the city several times on the 28th and attacked ×, killing many on the spot. × constantly launched fierce attacks, using intense artillery fire to densely bombard the southeast gates. The sound of the artillery shook the heavens and the earth. The city walls, streets, and houses were shattered to pieces. Our defending soldiers still braved death to fight back. As × approached, they jumped out to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. In the afternoon, × planes swarmed in to attack, unleashing bombs and machine guns. More than half of the city was turned to ashes. Our army still used the broken walls and ruins as cover, exacting the greatest possible price from × with a spirit of certain death. In the evening, × became more and more numerous and poured into the city in large numbers. Our isolated army withdrew from Chaoan City in street battles, and moved to the Yixi Beixiang area north of the city to await an opportunity to counterattack. Chaoan was thus declared to have completely fallen into the hands of the × army.

[Central News Agency Wengyuan, 30th] On the 28th, our plainclothes team detoured from a certain place and charged into the Longyandong Yantang Shahe area in the suburbs of Guangzhou to attack the × army. They planted the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flags all over the nearby ridges.

Our Army Counterattacks Jicheng

(Ming Ge News Agency Xiangning, 30th) While × has been attacking south for days in Taiyue Mountain, a certain army of mine has launched a fierce counterattack against × in the direction of Yicheng, fighting fiercely for five or six days, killing a large number of ×. From the 20th to the 25th, × used 60 trucks every day to carry the wounded soldiers and corpses, and the sound of crying was incessant along the way. The panic of × can be seen.

(Ming Ge News Agency Changzhi, 30th) A unit of my army attacked the Sanwanghuabao Station north of Handan the night before last, and fought fiercely with × for several hours, once capturing the station. Subsequently, × counterattacked with a train, nine cars, and four armored vehicles from the north. My army then withdrew from the battle. In this battle, more than 20 × were killed, and a portion of military supplies was captured. Also, on the morning of the 22nd, a unit of about 300 × from Yongnian attacked northwest, and fought fiercely with a certain unit of mine for two hours.

(Ming Ge News Agency Yulin, 30th) The × in western Sui have recently been acting again, attempting to attack my Hetao. It has been widely rumored in recent days that the central government has ordered the complete relocation of the famous Inner Zhao Temple on Langshan (northwest of Wu Xi). According to those who have moved out of the mountains, a large number of × troops have started west from Bailingchu, attached with many tanks, and are stationed at the ferry crossings of Wu Han Temple, Laohukou, and Xida. × artillery fire covers the attempt to cross the river forcibly.

According to a senior officer at the front, Baotou currently has 1,500 ×, attached with more than ten tanks and more than eighty cars. Troops on the Ping Sui Line have been reading about × troops starting west. My units have made strict arrangements, and if × disturbs the west, they will be severely hit.

### One Week of Battle Situation: May 23rd to 29th, Announced by the Military Commission

(Central News Agency Chongqing, 29th) The spokesperson of the Military Commission said that in the past week, the northern and southern wars have been quite dramatic. The × in southern Jin suffered heavy losses, and its eight attempts to attack Zhongtiao Mountain finally suffered serious blows. On the other lines, our army has also achieved smaller victories. The × have landed and harassed in various coastal areas, but the × have no penetrating force. The process is summarized as follows:

Guangdong

After occupying Shantou, the × side used its main force to advance on Chaoan in three routes along the railway line, capturing Meixi and Anbu in succession. After our courageous counterattack, we once recovered them successively. Then, Caitang and Fuyang were captured by × again on the 25th and 26th. On the morning of the 27th, × launched a joint land and air attack on Chaoan from the southeast in two routes, and a fierce battle broke out between the two sides. The casualties of × were extremely high. After our army extracted a price from ×, it transferred its position.

Zhejiang

On the morning of the 23rd, in the waters of Zhoushan, more than 1,000 people from Dongyue and Cang were trying to land by force under the cover of artillery and advance to the county seat of Dinghai. Our defending army resisted fiercely and a fierce battle broke out. At the same time, a large number of × troops landed in Shenjiamen. By the evening of the 23rd, due to strategic reasons, we voluntarily abandoned the county seat and held the second line of defense, continuing to fight. On the 26th, five × warships, six motorboats, and more than ten civilian ships landed at Kanmenzhen Yaya in Yuhuan. After a head-on attack, more than 200 × were annihilated. The remaining × fled back to the ships in a panic. They came again on the 27th but failed. On the 28th, they greatly reinforced and launched a fierce attack. Because the fortifications were completely destroyed, our army withdrew from Kanmen and is still fighting fiercely. As for the waters outside the mouth of the Min River and the sea off Fuqing, many × ships have also gathered in recent days. On the 26th and 7th, they launched attacks on Chuanshi Island and the Eastern Islands belonging to Pingtan, respectively. Chuanshi Island is an unimportant small rocky mountain (according to yesterday's telegram, × has withdrawn), and our army did not originally defend it, so it fell into the hands of ×. Intense fighting on the Eastern Islands is continuing. The × have suffered heavy losses.

Shanxi

The battle situation in northwestern Shanxi has been quiet for days. Two to three thousand × in eastern Shanxi invaded southward along the Bai Jin Highway. After we met them in Nanguan Fenshuizhen, we inflicted heavy damage on them. The reinforcements of more than two thousand from Taiyuan and Qixian invaded Zou Maling, Quanzhen, and Guhen. They were all recovered after a courageous counterattack. The remaining × fled to the southwest and are still holding each other in Maijiazhuang. In addition, two to three thousand × have been invading southward in recent days, trying to cross the Ping Han Highway, but they have been blocked in the Chenjiazhuang Bizhen area. The × have made no progress. As for southern Jin, our army, after abandoning Gaoluo and Yuanqu last week, began to lure the × into the mountain valleys from the 23rd, launching a fierce attack. The × were overwhelmed and fled in a panic. On the 25th, Yuanqu was captured, and on the 26th, Niaoluo was captured. The × fled to Xiaxian and Wenxi. Our army continued to capture key areas such as Majiashan and has now heavily besieged the ×, stepping up the annihilation. In this battle, more than 20,000 × invaded southward, and more than 2,000 were annihilated within a few days. The elite of the × has been lost and is showing signs of exhaustion.

Other Aspects

In addition, in northern Sui, Kelizu Yingzi was captured, and in southern Hebei, the troops advanced to Zaoqiang, killing three × battalion commanders and a major general. In the battle of Tanbu Lucun in southern Shandong, more than 700 × were killed. In Anhui, the × who attacked north of Anqing were defeated. In eastern Henan, Wuzi and Lichangying were recovered. Machiushi in northern Jiangxi fell into our hands after a fierce battle. The × in Qianjiang, central Hubei, have been besieged for many days and have fled to Tianmen and are about to be recovered. The × occupying Junshan in northern Hunan have also fled to Yueyang. The area has been recovered three times. These are all major war results of the past week, and are specially reported here.

### Young People in Guizhou Province Voluntarily Enlist

### The Military and Civilians of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, and Jiangsu Issue a Joint Telegram to the Entire Country Expressing Deep Sympathy and Assistance to Compatriots and Foreign Nationals in the Tianjin Concessions

[Chongqing Central News Agency, 30th] The Party, government, and military authorities, along with people's organizations of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, and Jiangsu, and the Political Department of the ×th War Zone, deeply sympathize with and offer assistance to our compatriots and foreign nationals within the British and French concessions of Tianjin, which are being illegally blockaded by the indignant ××. A joint telegram is being sent to the national press and compatriots, urging unified support. The original telegram is as follows: Urgent. Chongqing Central News Agency please expedite, to all national newspapers and compatriots for your perusal: Since the July 7th Incident, wherever the violent × hooves have reached, they have engaged in arson, ××, pillaging, and looting, revealing their ×××××× nature without restraint. The lives of our people are being trampled upon, causing us to gnash our teeth in pain. We rise up to offer strong resistance. People around the world witness this violent, peace-breaking behavior, and in the spirit of justice, both condemn it and offer assistance. Having met strong resistance militarily and finding themselves isolated diplomatically due to infringing upon the interests of various countries, they become enraged and act even more recklessly. Towards our country, they indiscriminately bomb undefended cities and establish traitorous puppet organizations in an attempt to achieve their goals. Towards other countries, they constantly apply pressure, threatening the lives, property, and legitimate rights of foreign nationals in China. Recently, they have intensified their efforts, blockading the Tianjin concessions, attempting to drive foreign nationals into dire straits. Their intention is nothing more than to use diplomatic offensives to reverse their military decline, on one hand, and to stimulate their domestic public opinion, which is already weary of war, and on the other hand, to cut off foreign aid to us. All of our national compatriots should know that the violent × is a public enemy of world peace and a vermin of human civilization. Our resistance and the assistance of people from all countries arise from a shared sympathy for peace and justice. The blockade of the Tianjin concessions is a direct conflict between justice and peace versus violence. All of our people should, with a shared sense of hatred against the enemy, offer self-help and assist others, expanding the anti-Japanese and pro-foreign national movement. To our compatriots and foreign nationals residing in the British and French concessions of Tianjin, we should extend our deepest sympathy and assistance. To foreign nationals residing in other parts of our country, we should also offer sincere condolences from time to time. There is no need to use national diplomacy to send telegrams to various governments, demanding firm action against Japan. We call on the anti-aggression masses of the world to jointly condemn Japanese × atrocities and boycott Japanese goods. We firmly believe that the calls for world peace and justice, coupled with our country's firm resistance and struggle, will surely achieve great success and inflict severe blows on the aggressors. Today, we are truly at a point where we share the same fate and common interests with the countries of the Pacific. On one hand, we should strengthen our country's resistance. On the other hand, we should unite with peace-loving nations to fight together to ensure that the brutal Japanese militarists are eliminated as soon as possible and that China's independence and world peace are jointly guaranteed. This telegram is sent specifically, hoping for a joint uprising and unified advocacy. With utmost sincerity, the Zhejiang Provincial National Resistance Against × Self-Governance Committee, Frontline Daily, and 23 other groups.

### Enthusiastic Propaganda for Military Service Achieves Excellent Results in Guizhou Province, with the People Voluntarily Enlisting

[Chongqing Central News Agency, 30th] Regarding the propaganda work for military service, since the start of the war of resistance, Party headquarters in various regions have generally followed the instructions of the central government, focusing their efforts on promoting the idea of ​​serving in the military as an honor in society. Therefore, people in various regions have been eager to join the army and fight to kill the ×. Among them, the Guizhou Provincial Military Service Propaganda Office has achieved the most remarkable results. Since receiving the central government's instructions, the provincial Party headquarters has strictly ordered Party headquarters in various counties to gather gentry and actively promote military service based on local conditions, and to concentrate the strength of Party members to do practical work. In particular, Party members with a deeper understanding have taken the lead in complying with military service, influencing the public and creating a trend. Previously, more than 1,000 members of the Tai Bai Township Farmers Association in Xiuwen County were inspired by the propaganda of the county Party headquarters and voluntarily joined the army. The department then mobilized the masses to warmly send them off to show encouragement. More than 100 people continued to join the army voluntarily. Recently, there have been strong young men from Xifeng, Tongzi, Pingba, Pan County, Tianzhu, Guiyang Zhenfeng, Anlong and other counties, dozens to hundreds of people, requesting to join the army voluntarily in an endless stream. In addition, Zhou Benyuan, the principal of Yueying Elementary School in Guiyang, Yang Fusong, the teacher of the elementary school in Tianzhu, and Yu Naide, a student of the middle school in Pingba, have also abandoned their pens and asked to join the army. Currently, Party members and the public in various counties of the province are voluntarily joining the army, creating a surging trend. This is truly promising for the future of the war of resistance.

### × Soldiers in West Shanghai Shoot British Woman

[Chongqing Central News Agency, 30th] Shanghai News: British woman Ms. Langstein was driving along Zhongshan Road, passing Hongbo Road, around 8 PM on the 29th when she was suddenly shot at from behind by a Japanese sentinel. Ms. Langstein immediately accelerated, crossed the railway into the Japanese defense zone, and escaped. According to her account after escaping, she was on her way to the Nail Bridge to visit friends when about fifteen Japanese soldiers were engaged in a firefight with guerrillas. The Japanese soldiers opened fire and ordered her to stop. When they saw that she was a foreigner, they did not make things overly difficult for her.

### Internal Strife Within Puppet Organizations Is Intense; Wang Jingwei Unable to Organize Puppet Central Government; Two Puppet Generals to Discuss Merger in Beiping

[Reuters, Beijing, 29th] Well-informed Chinese sources say that after Wang Jingwei's recent visit to Beiping, it has been decided to establish a new "government" to replace the puppet Reformed Government in Nanjing. As for the puppet Provisional Government in Beiping, it will retain its semi-independent nature. The new organization will be called the "National Government," with Wang as chairman, located in Nanjing, governing the occupied areas south of the sea route. It will continue to use the Kuomintang's Blue Sky White Sun flag, but with the old Five-Color Flag inlaid in the corner. All "anti-Chiang" Kuomintang members will operate within the "National Government." The Japanese army will train Chinese troops for the new "government."

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 30th] It is learned here that Wang Jingwei plans to fly from Tokyo to Beiping within 24 hours. In July, the two puppet organizations in Beiping and Nanjing will reportedly meet in Beiping to discuss the organization of a puppet federal government in the Japanese-occupied territories. Wang will attend the meeting.

[Reuters Shanghai Correspondent] The "Reformed Academy" organized by the puppet Reformed Government in Nanjing has decided to adopt "Xin Shenbao" as a textbook for daily reading by the students of the school. It is heard that this decision is intended to develop the students' "correct political thought." It is noted that "Xin Shenbao" is under Japanese control and is known for its anti-British propaganda.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] According to well-informed sources here, it was said last night that the Chinese National Government and the majority of the Chinese people are determined to fight to the end, and all rumors of peace talks, especially that Wang Jingwei has found a preliminary plan for peace talks, are completely unfounded. Currently, all sectors are ignoring such rumors and Wang's proposals for peace. It is said that Wang's plan will inevitably fail in the eyes of the government and other sectors. According to sources here, Wang has returned to Shanghai from Beiping because both puppet governments in Beiping oppose his plan.

### It is Difficult for × Troops to Cross Dongting Lake, a Good Harvest is Expected in Hunan Province

— Huai Shui

Why did the battle situation in northern Hunan become quiet after the fall of Yueyang? According to our judgment, it is because the × people, based in Yueyang, are deeply afraid of the complex terrain composed of mountains, rivers, lakes, and swamps in northern Hunan, and the thorough destruction of transportation lines such as railways and highways. They would lose the support of their tanks and heavy artillery, which they rely on to win. Therefore, they have to temporarily stop advancing south. Some people have estimated that when the spring water in Dongting Lake rises, the × people are likely to use the navy to go up the river to attack our troops along the river.

After the fall of Nanchang, the troops from Wuchang to Yueyang were particularly busy. The × people threatened to concentrate three divisions of troops in northern Hunan to advance south. Many × ships docked at Yueyang Chenglingji on the shore of Dongting Lake, but according to our intelligence and the people who escaped from the occupied areas, the so-called "reinforcements" were mostly troop movements.

According to an old sailor with twenty years of experience sailing on Dongting Lake, the possibility of × ship activity is very small.

First, the water in Dongting Lake rises quickly, but it also falls quickly.

Second, when the water is high, many sandbars in the lake are submerged, and there is a vast expanse of water everywhere. Even those who sail on Dongting Lake all year round cannot be sure where it is deep and where it is shallow.

Dongting Lake is full of ports, with many waterways. Navigation must be marked with flags to indicate the waterways. Now these flags have been completely destroyed by us, and × ship activity is naturally difficult. Moreover, the only thing the × people can use is small motorboats. Several times, formations of forty or fifty small motorboats, under the cover of a dozen planes, attempted to land at three locations: Sijiao, Jiumazui, and Baxianyuan. Originally, these three locations are all located on the banks of the Xiang River, which are the three points on the peninsula that extends into the heart of the lake. If they could land successfully, they could strike the protruding troops on the Xinqiang River and go up the Xiang River. However, the × people's several attempts were unsuccessful. The ×× division guarding Dongting Chao has five reinforced fortifications and reasonable equipment. Every time the × people attack, several × ships are sunk.

We have now begun to learn to take the initiative to attack, so good news has been frequently reported near Dongting Lake recently!

Due to the lack of troops to allocate, our army sent a large number of guerrillas to attack behind ×, taking advantage of opportunities, causing heavy damage to ×, who had to concentrate their forces on a few important strongholds in an attempt to hold on. Recently, we have repeatedly won victories in the Xinqiang River area, and some troops have been active around Linxiang. The × people are being restrained everywhere, and there is no mention of crossing Dongting Lake.

"If Hubei and Hunan are rich, the world is sufficient." By holding Dongting Lake, we expect a great harvest in Hunan!

### From Baoji to Hanzhong (1)

— Our Special Correspondent, Geng Ya

1.  The Peril and Wonder of Highways and Plank Roads

Traveling south from Baoji to Hanzhong, or directly into Sichuan, it is difficult to purchase train tickets because so many people are registered and waiting for passage. Lodgings are in even shorter supply than tickets, with bare earth beds, devoid of all bedding, costing at least eight jiao more. That merchants should so exploit the national crisis is rather lacking in the spirit of reason. Travelers wait long for tickets, and through daily expenses for board and lodging, they soon find themselves without funds, making departure impossible. Yet as the saying goes, misfortune may be a blessing. This is a rising city, where all trades are in need of manpower; failing to travel, one finds work instead, sometimes easier than buying a ticket. Two female students of obstetrics and gynecology, witnessing a pregnant woman give birth on the street with no shelter, had an inspiration. They borrowed some capital from the county magistrate and founded an obstetrics hospital. In less than six months, the business was thriving, and a vagrant woman was transformed into a renowned doctor.

Thanks to a friend's help, the reporter was able to depart early on the third day. That day, the number of passenger cars and military vehicles (transporting wounded and disabled soldiers) traveling together was as many as thirty or forty, stretching continuously for more than ten li, a truly magnificent sight. Leaving Xuan City, we crossed the Wei River and gradually entered the mountains, circling upward to ascend the Qin Mountains (the ancient Dasanguan Pass). The grandeur of the mountain range and the tortuous route are both awe-inspiring and invigorating. Reaching the summit, we descended again, with clear streams, free from the muddy color of the Wei River, accompanying us on both the sunny and shady sides of the mountains. The forests are lush and green, reminiscent of the scenery of the south. Some say that southern Shaanxi is not typical of the Northwest, and there seems to be a distinct geographical basis for this.

The highway traveled by the vehicles mostly utilizes ancient plank roads. The plank road from Shiji to Baocheng is the Lianyun Plank Road, also known as the Northern Plank Road. Further south from Baocheng, passing through Ningqiang and entering Sichuan through Yuan, Zhaohua, and Jianzhou, is the Southern Plank Road. Both the Northern and Southern Plank Roads are located in towering mountains. In ancient times, the facilities were simple, and construction must have been extremely difficult. Reading Zhuge Wuhou's letter to his brother Jin, "Zhao Zilong retreated and burned more than one hundred li of the covered road north of Chiya. One end of the covered beam is in the mountains, and the other end is supported by pillars in the water. Now the water is high and swift, making it impossible to fix the pillars," one can imagine the challenges. Wuhou marched his troops through Xiegu Valley (in Mei County; Wuhou followed Baocheng [now Chenggu], which was over two hundred li shorter to Chang'an than Xiegu), and the plank bridges and covered roads numbered as many as five thousand. If all the Northern and Southern Plank Roads were counted together, the significance of the engineering feat would probably not be less than that of today's Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway.

Today, the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway is built, and cars come and go, much faster than using wooden oxen and flowing horses on the plank road, but the route is thousands of li long, and much of it passes through deep mountains and dangerous ravines, suddenly rising to the clouds, suddenly descending into a deep valley. The "one man at the pass, ten thousand cannot pass" strategic points are truly endless. In terms of modern offensive and defensive tactics, once the slope is destroyed or the bridge is broken, the attacker must travel long distances and cannot easily use heavy weapons, while the defender can resist layer by layer, making full use of the effectiveness of various new weapons, and it is certain that victory will be achieved. Wang Jingwei betrayed the country and surrendered to the enemy, rashly flattering the enemy: invading Hanzhong and threatening Sichuan! He obviously does not understand the geographical characteristics of Sichuan and Hanzhong, which is no different from an idiot talking in his sleep!

Traveling on and on, driving down the Qin Mountains, we walked a long and relatively flat dam (called Chuanba in the north), which is Fengxian County. Between Liuba and Fengxian, we had to climb up Fengling again, and then the white clouds touched the sky, and we had to go up another level to pass through the Chaiguan Ridge with trembling flesh and a throbbing heart. The scenery along the way is extremely dangerous, especially when arriving at the high hill, with temples in front and behind, watching dozens of cars winding and descending on the surface, like gray butterflies chasing each other, lively and vivacious in the beautiful green forest and Taoxi.

There is a small town under the ridge, named Miaotaizi, where the "Han Zhang Huanhou Temple" is built. It is said that it also enshrines Marquis Liu, so it is also called the Liu Hou Shrine. On the west mountain peak of the shrine is the place where Zifang fasted (there is also a Zhang Liang Temple on the Qinling Mountains), with ancient pines and cypresses, and the forests are especially beautiful.

From here, both sides of the highway are ten-thousand-foot-high hills, with a river in the middle. The car follows its bank, moving forward gently. The river becomes more and more rapid, and the line of sight becomes narrower and narrower. At about three or four o'clock in the afternoon, the sunlight is blocked by the mountains.

Looking ahead, there is a high peak, the mountain is steeper, and its shape is slightly like a chicken's head. This is the ancient battlefield of Jitou Pass (formerly known as Qipanling). The ridge is full of jagged rocks, and those who climb it are like climbing a cloud ladder. The plank road passes on the right bank through the Jianmen Gate. The highway crosses the bridge and walks on the left bank, and also has to chisel a stone cave to pass through. The aforementioned Northern Plank Road ends here. The plank road burned by Xiao He also refers to this line. During the Chu-Han Contention, Emperor Gao was besieged by Hegemon King at Jitou Pass. There is a local land temple on the pass, which is said to enshrine the old man who gave Emperor Gao water to drink at that time. Also, there are "Thirteen Kinds of Ancient Posts in Shimen" engraved on the stone wall, including Cao Cao's handwriting, which is famous in the art world.

Leaving the pass, it suddenly opens up, and it is all a boundless wheat field. Although mountains are also faintly visible all around, they are already hundreds of miles away. This is the Hanzhong area that the traitors Han Fuju and Wang Jingwei have been thinking about. However, this place is not the boundary of Nanzheng (i.e., Hanzhong) County, but the jurisdiction of Baocheng County. The river that flows out with us is called Baocheng River, or Zijin River, or Heilongjiang, flowing south to join the Han River, going east to Xiangfan, also known as Xianghe, and then joining the Yangtze River at Hankou.

Baocheng is located on the right bank of the pass (i.e., the west bank of the Baocheng River). The civil houses and the construction of new factories can be seen one by one. The county is establishing a memorial tower for the martyrs of the war of resistance on the main road. In front of it stands a wooden archway, and the car passes through it. Looking up, there are words saying: "The Japanese bandits are not eliminated, and the warriors are ashamed to enter this door!" Looking back, it says: "This is the road for the anti-Japanese heroes to advance!" This is very encouraging and alert, especially when viewed by the brave soldiers marching north to kill the bandits.

### Germany Intensifies Military Preparations; Situation in Danzig Serious; Polish President Addresses Nation to Defend Territory and Expand Navy

[Warsaw Central News Agency, 29th] It has just been learned here that 4,000 Germans secretly entered the Free City of Danzig last night from East Prussia in many trucks to join the volunteer corps organized by the Danzig National Socialist Party. The Polish government, considering the situation serious, is rushing to build defenses along the Danzig area. A defense line of about 20 kilometers has already been built from Gdynia to Danzig. In addition, most of the Polish Navy's warships, including some torpedo boats, have also been concentrated in the waters of Gdynia. However, most people believe that German leader Hitler will not act rashly and use force to seize the Free City of Danzig, which would lead to war.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 29th] According to semi-official reports from Danzig received here tonight, weapons and personnel continue to be transported from East Prussia to Danzig. On Wednesday night, sixteen cannons were loaded onto tugboats in a bay east of Danzig and transported to Biskupiec. The Danzig authorities are currently working hard to build strong gun emplacements there. A barracks on a small hill has also been converted into an arsenal, and the hill is heavily guarded. It is reported that hundreds of stormtroopers have arrived in Danzig, and Nazis from East Prussia are forming volunteer corps, now residing in pre-war underground fortifications.

[Reuters, Berlin, 29th] Officials here strongly deny that German troops have entered Danzig or are forming volunteer corps there. They only acknowledge that Danzig is currently strengthening its peaceful strength within legal limits and is only recruiting Danzig citizens. The motive for this is due to the "reckless and irresponsible behavior" of Polish officials and other elements in the "corridor." According to official news from Danzig, some kind of event is clearly taking place in Danzig, and the situation is deteriorating. However, the claim of German troop movements has not been verified.

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 30th] The Polish National "Maritime and Colonial League" initiated a national "Ocean Week." Polish President Mościcki delivered a radio address to the nation on the 29th. Mościcki spoke of the importance of Danzig to Poland, stating that the close connection between Danzig and Poland has existed for hundreds of years, and that Danzig and Gdynia account for four-fifths of Poland's international trade. The two ports are not only Poland's gateway to the sea, but also the anchorage for merchant ships from various countries. As the nation celebrates the "Fisherman's Festival," the nation's attention is focused on Danzig and Gdynia, while also remembering the soldiers who protect our Polish maritime rights. He also pointed out that "Pomerania and the Polish Baltic coast are the nation's supreme treasures, inextricably linked to the lives of the people. The louder the enemy's calls, the stronger Poland's will to sacrifice to defend its territory. Poland has restored its independence and built a new country on the shores of the Baltic Sea, bringing peace and labor together. Today's Polish people have not wasted their precious time. The pain of being despised in the past has been mostly eliminated. The work we are carrying out today will continue, not only for the sake of Poland but also for the benefit of countries that have economic or cultural ties with Poland. However, the world we live in today is a world of military competition, and there is a danger of conflict in the Baltic Sea region. Poland wants to maintain peace and order, so Poland's naval power must be increased. The National Maritime and Colonial League has received sufficient donations to build a new submarine, which will be named 'Orzeł.'" Finally, he added that "Poland's air force is strong, and it is hoped that the navy will not lag behind, enough to carry out the mission of a 'maritime power.'"

### Halifax Speech: England and France Resist Aggression; Germany's Forceful Claims Lead to Isolation; Hope for Early Success in Anglo-Soviet Negotiations; England Decides to Accept Soviet Demands

[Central News Agency, London, 29th] The British government has already decided to accept all of Moscow's demands. According to sources with inside knowledge of diplomatic circles here, relayed by the Haitong News Agency, the British government's confidence in the future of negotiations with Moscow is based on the following reality: the final instructions issued to Ambassador Seeds and Special Envoy Strang almost entirely accept Soviet demands. England and France are now prepared to include the names of the Baltic countries, which had previously been explicitly rejected, and other neutral countries in the mutual guarantee treaty. It is said that Luxembourg is among these neutral countries, having been requested for inclusion by France. Regarding the Baltic countries, only one point remains unresolved: how to deal with the situation if one of these countries changes its relationship with neighboring countries due to internal political changes. However, London does not consider this difficulty to be particularly serious, as Ambassador Seeds has received instructions with full authority to accommodate Soviet demands, even if these demands exceed the scope of the latest proposals, as long as the alliance can be established quickly.

[Reuters, London, 29th] Foreign Secretary Halifax (see photo) delivered a speech at the Royal Institute today, saying: "If further acts of aggression occur, we are determined to fulfill our obligations to resist with all our strength. There are certain nations whose people, holding a different international philosophy, do not hesitate to distort the truth and misrepresent our actions and motives. We learn of these things, knowing them to be untrue, and knowing that even those who spread these rumors know them to be untrue. Therefore, we find them particularly despicable. All these facts of injury to free people are deeply noted here. Britain will never be cowed by rumors or force. In this degenerate age, many surprising events occur. Our purpose having been defamed by slander, it seems we should resolutely make a clear statement. Our initial determination is to limit aggression, and for this reason, we have allied with other countries to deal with this common crisis. The sole purpose of this measure is self-defense, but unfortunately, it has been regarded as a policy of isolation and a deliberate attempt to encircle Germany and Italy and hinder their search for living space. But what is the truth? Germany can truly be said to have achieved self-isolation successfully. Economically, its policy is monopolistic; politically, its policy is causing unrest throughout the world; culturally, its policy is racialism. These are all paths to self-isolation. Since Germany is striving to isolate itself, how can it blame others? As for Germany and Italy's claim that we are cutting off their search for 'living space,' it is even more inexplicable.

Occupying land by force is by no means a way to solve the problem of 'living space.' It is necessary to cultivate good internal governance and harmonious international relations to approach a solution. But what we must pay attention to is that when Germany makes this demand, its own country is welcoming foreign immigrants, recruiting a large number of Czech, Dutch, and Italian workers to meet the needs of its industry and agriculture. On what basis, then, does Germany claim to be overpopulated? In fact, countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and the British Isles can be said to be overpopulated, but we can still solve this problem through production and work. Economically, the relations between countries in the world are like weaving, extremely close. Therefore, no country can attempt to harm its neighbors for its own benefit. If we proceed through cooperation, the opportunities to satisfy the economic life of all countries are plentiful, and the so-called 'living space' can be solved at once. If the world is organized in this way, then Germany and Italy will not have to fear for their own security. However, no one can establish an international society by force. While living, fearing the violence of others on one hand, and using all their resources on defense on the other, there can be no peace. To make calls for peace is truly empty words, unless disarmament is implemented as a guarantee, and the right of other countries to enjoy their freedom is truly recognized. As of today, militarism has blocked the path to resolution. The whole world is filled with jealousy, hatred, malice, and harshness. If the advocacy of force can be abolished, so that the terror of war no longer exists in the world, then all unresolved problems will be easily solved. At this time, countries can openly discuss political and economic difficulties, whether they are of an international nature or colonial issues. However, if the responsible spokesperson of a country's government constantly refers to its friendly nations as thieves or conspirators, and slanders Britain's world policy, then it will be difficult for Britain to negotiate with it. The British government's commitment lies in restoring confidence in all countries, and the second step is to rebuild an

international order, making it reach a broader and more solid foundation." After Halifax discussed the League of Nations and its covenant, he said, "Unless there is an organization whose function is sufficient to achieve peaceful transitions, it is insufficient to merely seek ways to prevent changes to the status quo by force. Our foreign policy, in addition to dealing with current events, extends to the future. British policy has two basic principles: one is the determination to resist force, and the other is to

recognize the intentions of the world and carry out construction work to establish peace. In today's atmosphere of war clouds, Britain's most direct task is still to resist aggression. I would like to make a solemn statement on this so as not to be misunderstood by others. If we can dispel misunderstandings and obtain solutions, we must not merely make empty words, but must use concrete facts to make the whole world believe it. Whether giving or taking, both sides must act with concrete actions, and must not merely exchange substantial gains for empty promises." Before Halifax delivered the above speech, he had discussed the agreements established with Poland, Turkey, Greece, and Romania, and expressed the hope that

Anglo-Soviet negotiations could be completed soon. In conclusion, Halifax said, "Our obligations to Poland, Turkey, Greece, and Romania have absolutely achieved mutual understanding. We deeply know that if other countries lose their security and independence, then the security and independence of Britain will also suffer serious threats. Our military expansion preparations are progressing day by day. In political, administrative, and industrial aspects, it is enough to prove that the government's efforts have obtained the support of the public opinion of the entire country. If international law and world order must be maintained, then we must be prepared to

fight for international security. In addition to military strength, Britain also has a united people and abundant resources."

### German Newspaper Mockery

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th] Today, the newspapers here are all mocking Halifax's speech, which is enough to show the reaction of German political circles to the British Foreign Secretary's words. The 'Berlin Times' praised the British Foreign Secretary as 'the respectable old Halifax,' and criticized his speech, saying that the British Foreign Secretary made mistakes in his propaganda aimed at restoring British prestige: (1) believing that unreasonable debates can be repeatedly supported; (2) underestimating the common sense and observation of people outside its sphere of influence, especially for Germans, otherwise the British Foreign Secretary's explanation of Britain's position, like Britain's past policy of maintaining a balance of power, interfering with the freedom of European countries, will be impossible to obtain an explanation." It was learned here that the British Foreign Secretary's speech was delayed, so most newspapers did not have time to write comments. In addition to the 'Berlin Times,' only the 'Deutsche Zeitung' commented on the speech, saying, 'Halifax's attempt to attribute the intention of self-isolation to Germany has obviously failed miserably. Germany is not isolated among the countries of the world, and its policies have won the trust of neutral neighbors. The British Foreign Secretary's speech is a hesitant and self-contradictory speech, and does not match its guarantee of peaceful intentions,' it said.

### Singapore Conference: Successfully Completed; Chamberlain Reports in the House of Commons

[Reuters, London, 19th] Prime Minister Chamberlain, in response to a question from Labor MP Henderson in the House of Commons today, said that he could not report the details of the Singapore Joint Defense Conference, and only said that the conference had been extremely successful. Henderson also asked whether cooperative measures for the Anglo-French Far East Allied Forces would be stipulated in the event of war in the Far East. Chamberlain said that this was one of the main topics discussed at the conference.

### British Supply Department Bill Passes Second Reading in the House of Lords

[Reuters, London, 29th] The House of Lords passed the second reading of the Supply Department Bill today.

### British Empire Press Union Meets in London

[Reuters, London, 29th] At a meeting of the British Empire Press Union today, Chen Yifan, a representative of the Hong Kong press, said that Hong Kong

believed that the Tianjin and Shanghai issues were only a prelude to an attack on Hong Kong. If any concrete concessions were made to Japan, further infringement by Japan on the rights of the Hong Kong press would be inevitable, he said.

### US Congress Passes Continued Purchase of Foreign Silver; Maintains President's Devaluation Power

[Reuters, Washington, 30th] The US Senate and House of Representatives held a joint meeting yesterday and decided to continue to maintain the President's power to devalue the US dollar and the Treasury Department's power to purchase foreign silver.

[Reuters, Washington, 30th] Yesterday's joint meeting of the Senate and House of Representatives decided that the price of domestically newly minted silver would be 70 cents per ounce. The bill must first be passed by both houses before it can be sent to the White House.

US Treasury Secretary Delivers Speech

[Reuters, Washington, 29th] US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told the press today, "The Treasury Department will adjust the price of foreign silver based on the London silver market to prevent foreigners from dumping large amounts of silver. Foreign merchants expect the United States to completely stop buying foreign silver, but whether the United States will continue to buy silver from abroad will depend on the final decision of Congress on the monetary bill. If Congress decides to raise the price of domestic silver, the government will levy a 50% silver profit tax on American silver sellers. This tax was previously applied to foreign silver speculators. I believe that if the US government stops using the foreign exchange equalization fund and cancels the power to devalue the US dollar, it will lead to a serious situation. If the government's power to deal with finance cannot be maintained, the Treasury Department may still have some power to deal with the foreign exchange market, but it is impossible to know how much success it will achieve," he said.

[Central News Agency, London, 24th] After the US Treasury Department repeatedly lowered the set price for purchasing foreign silver, the silver price here fell another three-quarters of a penny per ounce. Whether the US financial authorities will continue to lower the silver price on the evening of the 29th is something that people in the market here are generally looking forward to. According to the observation of a certain person in the financial community, the silver price will not fall below 18 pence per ounce, and he believes that the fall in the silver price is enough to constitute a powerful weapon to deal with Japan. The US authorities may use it to urge Japan to take a more moderate attitude, it is not known, he said.

### US Neutrality Legislation: House of Representatives to Vote

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] Regarding the Neutrality Act issue, the amendment proposed by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom, "advocating the abolition of the current provisions regarding the arms embargo and authorizing the President to designate belligerent countries and war zones," is currently being continuously discussed by the House of Representatives. Democratic Congressman Shanley said that it would be better to have no Neutrality Act than to enact an imperfect one. Republican congressmen applauded in approval. Republican Congressman Barra said that any Neutrality Act is difficult to perfect. We will never allow a single American soldier to go abroad to fight (congressmen applauded warmly). He also said that if we ban the transport of arms to England and France after a war breaks out, and London and Paris are subjected to air raids, public opinion will be opposed to the embargo measure, and it will be difficult to resist. Judging from yesterday's discussion results, most congressmen advocate restoring international law, maintaining the original state of neutrality, and still allowing arms to be transported to belligerent countries, while completely abolishing the current Neutrality Act, only maintaining the current measures for monitoring and licensing arms exports. If this important amendment is accepted by the House of Representatives, then the possibility of extending credit loans to belligerent countries will still exist, and the arms embargo measure will inevitably be canceled. The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on it tomorrow. The Democratic members of the Foreign Affairs Committee will first meet to decide their attitude before the House of Representatives convenes.

### German Economics Minister To Visit Holland; To Hold Economic Negotiations

(Reuters, Berlin, 30th) The German Economics Minister, Funk, will travel to Holland next week to stay for several days, to reciprocate the visit to Germany by the former Dutch Economics Minister, Steipe. Dr. Funk will arrive in the Hague on Wednesday of next week, and leave on Friday. He will meet with the President of the Dutch National Bank, and will hold economic negotiations of a general nature with the Dutch authorities.

### China Invites British Labor Leaders To Come East For Inspection

[Central News Agency, London, 29th] The Chinese labor community recently

invited the National Executive Committee of the British Labor Movement (formed by the various Labor Party factions, the Labor Party Executive Committee, and the Trades Union Congress Executive Committee) to send a delegation to China to inspect the current situation.

### Siam Denies Request For English And French Guarantees

(Haitong News Agency, Paris, 30th) The Siamese Embassy in France issued a press release denying that the country would have requested English and French guarantees. The press release stated, "The foreign policy of the Siamese government lies in the development of friendship with all countries, treating all equally, without partiality. There has been no change to date."

### America Pays Close Attention To Overseas Situation

Hull And Dutch Ambassador Had Lengthy Talk [Reuters, Washington, 29th] US Secretary of State Hull had lunch with President Roosevelt at the White House today and reported to the President on the recent overseas situation, focusing on Danzig and China. Prior to this, Hull had a lengthy conversation with the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, who will soon return home for vacation.

### Slovakian Delegation Arrives in Germany

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th] A Slovakian delegation, led by Special Envoy Plik, arrived here on Thursday to hold negotiations with the German government. These negotiations will discuss all the issues between Germany and Slovakia arising after the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The negotiation period is approximately three weeks.

Short Commentary

### Japanese × New Strategy

According to a dispatch from Guilin, the new Japanese × strategy for invading China is as follows: (1) main offensive against Jinshan; (2) supporting offensive against central Hubei; (3) feigned offensive against Hunan and Jiangxi; (4) naval guerrilla attacks against South China; (5) continued mopping-up operations against southern Shanxi and northern Jiangsu; (6) "clearing" guerrillas in central China within a time limit; (7) occupying eastern Zhejiang by early July. It is expected that there is a considerable basis for this ×, but we should also have the following basic understandings of the future predatory strategies of the × people:

(1) At present, the main purpose of ×× operations is to cooperate with political and economic offensives, focusing on consolidating the rule of the occupied areas, so as to use our manpower, material resources, and financial resources to nurture the Japanese army to conquer China.

(2) × may adopt a main offensive posture against Jinshan, but the purpose is still to consolidate the occupied areas, and mop up guerrillas and their bases; therefore, we must recognize that if Jinshan is in danger, the overall situation will be affected, and the recent hard battles and great victories on the western front are actually the main reason for the southwest to obtain stability.

(3) ×'s manpower is now increasingly dispersed, and it feels increasingly insufficient. It can only rely on the mobility of its troops to carry out jumping operations, on the one hand deliberately cultivating our sense of "security" in the southwest, loosening our active anti-Japanese emotions, turning the protracted war into a dragging war, and on the other hand consolidating and expanding the occupied areas, raising troops to prepare to "conquer all of China in one go"!

(4) Therefore, we must be seriously vigilant today, follow the instructions of Chairman Chiang, strive for initiative, and fight the overall anti-Japanese war. Only an active, comprehensive, and protracted war can break the Japanese's new tricks and new conspiracies!

### Anglo-German Naval Issue: Germany Will Reply To British Memorandum; Hitler To Give Speech Today

[Reuters, Berlin, 29th] Germany will reply to the British memorandum on the Anglo-German Naval Agreement at an "appropriate time." This reply will be conducted through diplomatic means, as the document is mostly technical issues and is not suitable for Hitler to answer in his speech. According to opinions in political circles, if Hitler speaks in Bremen on Saturday, it will not be a major political speech. British Ambassador to Germany Henderson will return to London next Tuesday for a week's vacation. It is expected that Germany will still not be able to send a reply at that time. German political circles also stated that there is mutual suspicion between Britain and Germany. Germany cannot believe Britain's words of willingness to reconcile unless Britain changes its government. Germany is unwilling to talk with it.

[Reuters, Berlin, 30th] Reuters learned that Hitler may go to Bremen tomorrow to preside over the launching of a warship and deliver a speech. It is generally believed that Hitler should rest before dealing with the expected major events that will arrive in the summer, so he will not participate in any unnecessary gatherings. Moreover, Hitler knows that his speech is extremely important to the world, so the time and place for delivering the speech must be carefully considered. If he speaks tomorrow because of the warship launching, he will inevitably mention the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, but he is currently unwilling to issue a formal German reply to England.

### Anglo-Japanese Tianjin Negotiations Set To Begin In Tokyo On The 6th; Commercial Activity Still Suspended In The British Concession

[Reuters, Tokyo, 30th] Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin issue will begin in Tokyo on the 7th (or 6th). According to reports in the Japanese newspapers, the Japanese Consul in Tianjin, Tanaka, a representative from the Japanese Tianjin

Office, and the British Vice-Consul in Tianjin will discuss "local" events in Tianjin at this meeting. The

Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, will negotiate with the Japanese Foreign Minister's representative Kato on the "basic Chinese issues that affect the Tianjin incident." The Asahi Shimbun commented on this matter, saying, "Japan

The attitude of Britain in North China is to concretely implement its abandonment of Qin's policy and change its basic policies."

[Central News Agency, London, 29th] Regarding the Tianjin incident, England and Japan have already decided to negotiate in Tokyo. Generally speaking, the Japanese government

will wait until the British and Japanese consuls in Tianjin arrive in Tokyo before starting negotiations. The date will be in the middle of next week.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma met with Army Minister Itagaki and Navy Minister Yonai for a long time yesterday to discuss the demands that the Japanese side will put forward in the future negotiations between the Japanese representative and British Ambassador to Japan Craigie as conditions for resolving the Tianjin issue. It is reported that the Japanese representative will be Kato, an advisor to the Japanese Embassy in "Manchukuo," and Toshihide Tashiro, the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin. The Japanese cabinet met yesterday and decided to promote Kato to the rank of minister. As before, when negotiating in Tianjin, Kato was also the Japanese representative. He only flew to Tokyo yesterday, while the Tianjin Consul-General Tashiro has already been here for a long time.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] Tianjin foreign dispatch, the New Zealand Honorary Consul in Tianjin, Davis, passed freely through the entrance of the racecourse today, and did not encounter any

difficulties, which proves that the Japanese army has complied with the orders of the Japanese army commander. British and other businesses within the British concession are still in a state of suspension. A British expatriate said that Japan now has the possibility of a large-scale war with the Soviet Union, so there is hope for a resolution of the Tianjin issue between England and Japan. Another British banker said that it is absolutely impossible for Britain to cooperate with the Joint Reserve Bank of North China.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 30th] The only English newspaper here, the Hankou Free Press, criticized Anglo-Japanese and Soviet-Japanese relations in its article yesterday, saying, "The true purpose of the Japanese army provoking the Mongolian-Manchurian border incident is extremely clear. The Japanese are now trying to expel British forces in China. If the Japanese cannot be sure that the Soviet Union will strictly adhere to a neutral attitude, they will not dare to break with England. Furthermore, the act of sending planes to bomb Outer Mongolia is actually to test the Soviet Union's attitude. If the Soviet Union really wants to go to war with Japan, it can use this as an excuse. Therefore, Japanese newspapers all understand the Soviet Union's intentions and can predict the attitude the Soviet Union will take once England and Japan go to war."

[Reuters, London, 30th] Labor MP Baker asked Undersecretary of State Butler today, "The Japanese authorities in Shantou prevented the two ships, 'Western Star' and 'Guangdong,' from entering the port, forcibly occupied the Swire wharf, and tore down the British flag. The Japanese commander in Tianjin also stated that he would intensify the blockade of the concession. What is the situation regarding these events?" Undersecretary of State Butler replied, "The British ships will not sail to Shantou after being advised by the local British naval authorities. Obstacles have been placed near the Swire wharf, but it has not yet been occupied. According to the information received by Foreign Secretary Halifax, he cannot confirm the tearing down of the British flag or the intensification of the blockade of the Tianjin concession. Also, Henderson asked, 'Now that negotiations are underway, is it possible to ease the blockade situation in Tianjin?' The Undersecretary replied, 'This is very possible. The Foreign Office cannot officially confirm the Japanese military authorities' declaration of intensifying the blockade.'"

### US Chief of Staff Proposes Defense Plan; Expand Army To Prepare Outpost Line; General Craig To Retire Soon

[Reuters, Washington, 30th] US Chief of Staff General Craig, before his impending retirement, proposed a defense plan, which is divided into three points, including the establishment of five elite divisions, to quickly repel any attacks by the × people on the Western Hemisphere in the event of an emergency. The army now needs to increase officers by 2,800 and soldiers by 23,000 to expand the existing four divisions and establish a fifth division. Other key points of the plan include preparing outpost defense lines in Alaska, Hawaii, Panama, and Puerto Rico, which can be used immediately, and organizing a reserve army to expand the current army to one million people.

### Weather Station

Tokyo, is the peace talk; Tianjin, then intensifies the blockade! This two-man act is performed wonderfully and unusually. What on the stage isn’t the red-faced character and the white-faced character? We very much hold others’ worries, Mr. Herbert. When flying back to Tianjin from Tokyo, will he be able to pass through that gate?

A message for our British friends: quickly stop being fooled by the Japanese. Only an “armored

Head” can soften them. The British have an old saying: “We can endure until the last minute, and only the last minute is the key to victory.” We hope that the last minute will not come too late!

The British Foreign Minister’s speech stated that if another act of aggression occurs internationally, we will use all our strength to fulfill our obligations. How wide is this step?

Reuters, London, 29th: Chen Yifan, a well-known figure in the Chinese art world, said in a speech at the Imperial Press Association today that the concession incidents in Tianjin and Shanghai are a prelude to future Japanese military invasions of Hong Kong. If so, if the British government retreats step by step regarding the concession incidents, then it will be difficult to avoid the Japanese military interfering in Hong Kong's freedom of speech. Believe it or not.

### World Curiosities: A Chimpanzee Son

In Paris, a famous veterinarian, Dr. Menard, has announced an unprecedented experiment in psychological education:

Ten years ago, when Dr. Menard was on an expedition to the Philippines, he captured a young chimpanzee, only two years old, in the jungle. He brought it back home and named it "Faton." Dr. Menard, his wife, and their two sons did their best to make "Faton" forget that it was originally an animal. That is, they treated it exactly like a human, allowing it to grow up, but without formally teaching or training it, relying entirely on the natural laws of development to lead it from an animal's life into human society.

"Faton" first met the public at a grand banquet recently held by Dr. Menard. He invited many famous psychologists, doctors, and journalists to his home. After everyone was seated, the door to the dining room opened, and "Faton," dressed neatly, walked into the room on his hind legs, just like a human. He closed the door behind him and waited for an introduction. He politely shook hands with each guest, but his face showed no expression. Then, he found the last seat at the end of the table and sat down. He ate his portion of food without making the slightest mistake. The dinner served to him was exactly the same as everyone else's, with soup, fish, meat, vegetables, and dessert. He calmly accepted the dishes from his neighbor, took a little for himself, and passed them on to others. He ate cleanly. The only difference during the meal was that he took a little more vegetables and fruit than others. He held his wine glass and drank wine in a dignified manner, not gulping it down in one go, but politely sipping it from time to time. When dessert was served, he suddenly got up, walked to Mrs. Menard, affectionately put his arms around her shoulders, and clearly called out, "Mama, Mama!" Then, he pointed playfully at a bottle of white wine, because he recognized the label. It was his favorite, and he wanted a glass. As they were drinking coffee, Dr. Menard said, "We should have a smoke." Without being told, "Faton" skillfully walked over, opened a cabinet, took out a box of cigars, and then took out several kinds of cigarettes, distributing them one by one to the guests, lighting them for each person, not forgetting anyone. Finally, he lit a cigarette for himself. With an ashtray in hand, he sat down comfortably and smoked. When he finished, he put the butt in the ashtray and extinguished it.

This chimpanzee was wearing a comfortable new shirt, light-colored trousers, and canvas shoes. He had his own bedroom, with a table, a rocking chair, a bed, a wardrobe, and a specially made tiled bathtub. He turned on the tap himself, tested the water temperature, and then washed his face before drying himself and getting dressed, just like a human. He wandered freely around the house, without breaking anything. He did not sneak into the pantry without permission. When Dr. Menard did not speak to him, he was honest and quiet, unlike other animals, without any of that restless energy.

After the meal, Dr. Menard explained his experiment to the guests, specifically stating: "Faton" had not received any chimpanzee training in a circus. Every action this chimpanzee performed had been recorded. The whole family had never specifically trained him to do anything. For ten years, he had grown into a "person," receiving the same guidance as his two sons, treated equally. He learned to open doors, open boxes, turn on light switches, and eat with knives, forks, and spoons on his own initiative. However, "Faton" only knew how to say one word, "Mama!" He learned this from the two children. Therefore, Dr. Menard concluded that the word "Mama" is the most basic language of mankind, the same in any language in the world. This is the easiest sound for a chimpanzee to pronounce, because it is a sound that can be heard naturally with only two openings and closings of the mouth.

Do you find this strange? The history of animals evolving into humans in thousands of years can be completed within ten years.

### Ghost

Old Mrs. Li was very afraid of ghosts. One day, she went to visit relatives. At night, she was invited to stay in a very remote and quiet room. After Mrs. Li and the others had settled down, she hurriedly closed the windows and bolted the door, but then she heard a voice from the bed saying: "Mrs. Li! Don't be afraid, now there are only two of us in the room."

### Rare News

Tibet only publishes one newspaper. The editor is a Protestant missionary named Ashbolt. Not long ago, Ashbolt traveled from Tibet to Europe and told reporters that he runs Tibet's only newspaper in a small village 10,000 feet above sea level. He is solely responsible for editing, printing, and distribution. The printing press is a small hand-operated printing press that prints only fifty copies each time. The subscribers are all local lamas, because only lamas in Tibet can read. However, as soon as the lamas receive the newspaper, they immediately gather the residents to explain the news in the newspaper. Therefore, although this newspaper only sells fifty copies, it has more than 100,000 "readers."

### One a Day

This place was originally "One Person a Day," but now an umbrella also wants to squeeze into the crowd.

That is no ordinary umbrella. It has been the center of attention in the world. It has been to Munich, appeasing Hitler; it has been to Rome, conveying friendship to Mussolini.

Now, let's talk about the umbrella's background. Its canopy is made of black silk, and its handle is brown, inlaid with a golden band. It weighs one and a half pounds and costs fifty-seven shillings and sixpence, which is not cheap.

Although this umbrella was sold at the Bailey Bridge store near James Palace, it was manufactured in a little-known factory with four male and two female workers. Every stitch on the umbrella was sewn by hand, and every button was ordered by hand.

Although this umbrella was often taken for repairs, it was never actually opened and used. Perhaps it was worn out from too much traveling. Now the shadow of an umbrella has arrived in the Far East. Let's wait and see!

### Sea Adventures of Lawton

— By Captain —, Translated by Yang Bi

(Previous summary: In the autumn of 1914, Jack, the radio operator, and Bill, the mechanic, of the Choukes Shipping Company, took the paddle steamer "Kebrongqi" to travel to Europe. On the ship, they received news that Britain and Germany had declared war, and a British warship was coming to intercept the ship. The ship fled frantically. Soon, it encountered an iceberg and British warship fire. With great difficulty, it escaped from the tiger's mouth and returned to the American territory of the White Sea. Jack and Bill returned to New York and saw Mr. Choukes. Choukes then asked them to take the "Saint Uke" to Europe to find his son.)

"Please send this out as soon as possible," he said, handing the letter to Jack.

When his eyes looked at the young telegraph operator, he showed a sense of familiarity, but the two young men did not pay attention. Bill was indifferent to this matter, but Jack frowned and looked at the letter. It was in code, addressed to a place in New York, and signed Martin Johnson.

"I'm very sorry, Mr. Johnson," Jack said, "we cannot send this letter for you."

"Cannot? Why can't you?" the passenger said angrily.

"Because it's in code."

"What does that matter?"

"We have orders that in wartime, we cannot send coded telegrams. Anything not written directly and clearly in English cannot be sent."

"This is truly absurd," he said, even more displeased, "I'm telling you, this is a commercial letter."

"If you can write it clearly in English, I can forward it," Jack said.

The man suddenly leaned forward, his hand reached into his pocket, and he immediately took out a roll of paper.

"Can I have a word with you in private?" he asked, his eyes darting towards Bill.

"Whatever you want to say, you can say it in front of my friend," Jack said.

"Well, look here—there's a hundred dollars in this roll," he threw it on the desk, "as long as you temporarily forget about the code rules, it's yours."

"Look, Mr. Johnson," Jack said righteously, "I've already told you our orders. As for your money, even if it were a million, it would be the same to me."

"Humph! You're a fool," the man said furiously, grabbing the roll of money, crumpling the letter in his hand, and storming out of the cabin.

"That evil kid again," he muttered as he walked onto the deck, "this will only give me another chance to settle the score with him. These American guys are all fools. Well, if I can't find a way in the radio room, at worst, Von Kerton won't get the report in New York."

"Hey," Bill asked after the black-bearded man left, "can you figure out who that guy is?"

"Who, Johnson?" Jack said lazily, "What, right. You now realize that there's a bit of familiarity in his voice and eyes, but in my life, I don't want to know him."

"I don't want to either, but I feel like I've met him before."

"There are as many people named Johnson as there are rotten medlars."

"Ha! We're really lucky to have found this rubber man from India!"

### Wimbledon Tennis Tournament, Fourth Day: Cai Huiquan Eliminated, Losing to Gugkiewicz, Score Very Close; American Youth Smith Creates Another Miracle

(Reuters, Wimbledon, 30th) On the fourth day of the Wimbledon Tennis Tournament, the men's singles entered the fourth round, and the women's doubles began. The situation was tense, and surprises occurred frequently.

Chinese players have all been eliminated. Xu Chengji retired, He Ai'ying was a flash in the pan, and although Cai Huiquan passed three rounds, he was unable to advance further. May they wait until next year, and wish Xu, Cai, and He the best of luck.

Cai Huiquan Defeated After Fierce Battle

In the first round, Cai Huiquan defeated Ireland's Aiken with scores of 5-7, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2, and 6-3. In the second round, he defeated England's Jones with scores of 6-3, 2-6, 6-2, and 6-4 to advance to the third round, making him one of the Chinese players [on the list] [only a few]. However, yesterday when he played against Gugkiewicz, he was finally defeated with scores of 6-4, 7-5, and 6-4 and was eliminated.

Gugkiewicz is a player from South Korea's Tai Cup. Although he is not a seeded player in major tournaments, he eliminated the highly favored seeded player, American McNair, in the second round with a straight set. His strength is evident. In yesterday's match, Gugkiewicz's fierce serves often made Cai unable to parry, and his sharp smashes and volleys made Cai exhausted. Cai had saved a set point with great effort in the first set at 3-5, and had taken the lead in the second set with scores of 2-1, 3-2, and 5-3, but Gugkiewicz then won several games in a row. The final game of the third set was also a love game.

One Seeded Player Loses to Indian

Poland's top player, Trochinsky, the last "seeded player" in the tournament, actually lost to India's Homo Mohammed in a straight set yesterday, with scores of 6-0, 6-3, and 6-4.

Trochinsky's inclusion as a seeded player relied entirely on his performance in the Germany-Poland Tai Cup. He had never lost in this year's Tai Cup, even defeating German stars Henkel and Menzel. Therefore, the tournament gave him special attention and selected him as a seed. Unexpectedly, he was defeated by this Indian Tai Cup first singles player.) (Note: In the Queen's Club Championship, this Indian player was the "runner-up" - he lost to Clem in the final. Gugkiewicz was eliminated by him in the semi-finals, which shows that his strength is also not weak.)

Austin Wins Against Douroni

Riggs (USA) and Elverlow (New Zealand) fought fiercely, although Riggs won in a straight set, with scores of 8-6, 11-9, and 6-2.

Austin (England) and former Czech player Douroni also had a fierce struggle. Austin won the first two sets with scores of 7-5 and 9-7. Afterwards, Douroni was injured during the match the previous day and could not continue the competition, so he voluntarily announced his retirement.

Curry (USA) defeated Rogers (Ireland) without much effort, with scores of 7-5, 6-1, and 6-4.

Henkel (Germany) and Saffi (England) fought to four sets, with scores of 16-4, 4-6, 6-4, and 6-1.

Pansek (South Africa) defeated McPhael (England) 6-3, 6-3, and 7-5.

American Youth Breaks Through

American "unknown hero" Smith, who eliminated German star Menzel, continued to produce a second miracle. His opponent was former Czech star Gina. After a fierce five-set battle, Smith finally won with scores of 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 1-6, and 6-1 to enter the fourth round.

Smith is a young high school principal from California. He is not listed on the American Top Ten list. This is his "first time" participating in Wimbledon. Unexpectedly, he was able to make a splash and overcome two difficult obstacles.

French Veteran's Power Undiminished

French veteran Brunnone defeated Italian top player Steffani yesterday to enter the fourth round, with scores of 6-4, 6-8, and 6-4. Other results are as follows:

Butler (England) defeated Iverfer (Germany) - 4-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3,

Ziggity (Hungary) defeated Schwart (Netherlands) - 8-6, 6-4, 6-4,

Sheres (England) defeated Spa (Czech) - 7-5, 6-4, 9-7,

Russell (Argentina) defeated Mondran (England) - 10-8, 6-4, 6-1,

Drufford (England) defeated Mitik (South Africa) 7-5, 6-4, 2-6, 2-6, 6-3,

Olive (England) defeated Collins (England) - 8-6, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4,

One Seeded Team Loses in Women's Doubles

In the first round of the women's doubles, another unexpected result was created. One of the seeded teams, Mrs. Matthew (France) and Miss Judy Risgaski (Poland), was惨败 by Stammers (Netherlands) and Mrs. Haimosley, with a straight set score of 6-3, 6-1. This winning team is also not mediocre, as they were seniors who had won the championship twice before (they had won the championship in 1935 and 1936). They are making a comeback this time, and their style has not diminished.

Many English Women Transfer in Doubles

Mrs. Carter-Tala and Mrs. Little (England) defeated Mrs. Enterus (USA) and Mrs. Henloting (France) - 7-5, 6-2,

Miss Pay and Miss Cardinal (England) defeated Miss Titz and Miss Schuman (Germany) - 6-1, 6-1,

Mrs. Bourbon and Miss Chavez (England) defeated Miss Austin and Miss Candice (England) - 6-2, 6-2,

Miss Sormaki (Hungary) and Miss Wheeler (USA) defeated Miss Bruton and Miss McPherson (England) - 6-4, 7-5,

Miss Knoll and Miss Connell (England) defeated Miss Merio and Miss Sloan (England) - 6-4, 6-2,

Miss Concorde and Miss Panito (France) defeated Thomas and Trantrouse (England) - 8-6, 6-2,

Miss Nolan and Miss Sutton (USA) defeated Miss Marquis and Miss Little (England) - 6-4, 10-8,

Rambo and Miss Magellan (England) defeated Miss Santos and Miss Scott (England) - 6-2, 1-6, 6-4,

### Boxing Championship Honor, Six-Month Term

(Washington Electric) The chairman of the All-American Boxing Association, Mr. Denoir, announced that the association will strictly enforce the established regulations, stipulating that the boxing champion must make a defense to maintain the championship honor within six months, otherwise the association will announce the vacancy of the boxing king's title. Mr. Dian also stated that the opponent in the defense must be a "qualified" competitor. The association will not recognize the competition as a championship if the opponent is chosen casually.

### Malayan Overseas Chinese Suspend National Games

— Qian Li

While Hong Kong's Chinese teams are actively sending strong contingents to compete abroad, the Overseas Chinese in Ipoh, recognizing the severity of the national crisis, plan to donate the 20,000 yuan originally earmarked for the 5th All-Malaya Chinese Games in Ipoh to relieve the homeland and aid disaster relief. Simultaneously, they will temporarily halt construction on the Perak Grand Stadium. This is a matter that deserves our attention.

The Overseas Chinese's love for sports is undoubtedly greater than that of our compatriots in the country. However, at this critical time for the nation, they are willing to forego their passion and allocate useful funds back to the homeland for disaster relief. Meanwhile, we are making every effort to use funds that should be used for resistance and disaster relief to attend the Olympics. Is this not a stark contrast?

Undeniably, sports have greatly benefited the youth of the new China, but we must ask, is sending a dozen or twenty athletes abroad enough to achieve the goal of revitalizing sports? Or are we using this to demonstrate our nation's wealth, unlike the pitiful people who cannot even afford to attend the World Games? Or are we using this to show the excellence of Chinese athletes and "promote national prestige" abroad? Unfortunately, the Chinese athletes sent to the World Games or the Davis Cup have always returned empty-handed, and even the strongest Chinese football teams have been repeatedly defeated by the South Vietnamese team, which is looked down upon by Europe. In this light, "promoting national prestige abroad" seems to be just a dream.

So, why? To show national wealth? But I think that even the so-called golden countries would not engage in such activities when their nation is in trouble. During the European War, which participating country attended international competitions? Even after the European War, did Germany and Russia not abstain from international competitions for many years? Does their doing so indicate their national poverty? No, absolutely not. On the contrary, it demonstrates their practicality and hard work, unlike our embellishment and muddled situation. Therefore, defeated Germany and chaotic Russia have today gained a pivotal position in the world, which is not accidental.

It has been almost two years since China began resisting the war, and in these two years, the loss of population, the destruction of property, and the fall of land have been rare tragedies in history. At this time of national crisis, with tens of thousands of people displaced, is it not a great joke to say that we still have the spare capacity to participate in such superficial and ostentatious national competitions? I don't believe that foreigners will praise China's wealth just because China attends the World Games. On the contrary, they may even laugh at our foolishness. Even the Japanese enemy's decision not to send a team is unlikely to be criticized for "national weakness." Because everyone knows that China and Japan are currently doing their best in the struggle for national survival.

Admittedly, sending a dozen or twenty athletes to the World Games may not require too much expense. Doing so may not necessarily weaken the country; not doing so may not necessarily save us from disaster. But the issue seems not to lie here, but in the spirit it represents. The cost of participating in the World Games may not be very high, but is the 20,000 yuan saved by the Ipoh Overseas Chinese a large sum? In any case, this money can save many wounded soldiers and many refugees.

Why can the Overseas Chinese in Ipoh think of this, while the compatriots in the country and Hong Kong, who are closer to the domestic tragedy, turn a blind eye? What is the reason for this? Is it neurological numbness? Or is the corruption too deep to extricate oneself? Or is this simply the demeanor of a great nation?

At this time of national crisis, they actually have the leisure and elegance to send teams to tour and compete in the south, and to send athletes to attend the World Games. This suddenly makes me realize why, when American Overseas Chinese are struggling to prevent American workers from shipping scrap copper and iron to Japanese ships, our compatriots in Hong Kong are massively selling scrap copper and iron from the mainland and shipping it on X ships without hesitation. When Overseas Chinese everywhere are rising up, and even Europeans and Americans are boycotting Japanese goods, Japanese goods, such as fabrics and toys, fill the counters of Chinese stores in Hong Kong. Moreover, although Hong Kong is now a gathering place for wealthy Chinese officials, even the planned sale of 10 million yuan in national salvation bonds is still far from being fully subscribed.

Thinking about it, although the Chinese living in Hong Kong are also called "Overseas Chinese," they are ultimately too close to the homeland. The long-standing corrupt atmosphere of the mainland inevitably permeates the minds of the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese, creating a sense of numbness and a life of drunken dreams. Look, the competition for beauty and extravagance in entertainment venues, the lively cheers in restaurants and tea houses, are they not in stark contrast to the flames of war and the broken limbs in the homeland?

The corrupt atmosphere in the homeland may have been purified by the continuous burning of Japanese bombs and gunpowder, removing the original hidden corruption. From the Soil

### Hunger and Struggle

— Booker

Humanity is too threatened by hunger. Let's have a thorough and happy revolution to change this cruel world!

In these turbulent times, the hungry masses have gradually been bred and grown under the furnace of suffering! Producing an invincible force!

China is a country with a particularly large number of hungry refugees, which is giving China an unprecedented and powerful anti-imperialist force. This force is applied to the struggle to expel the invaders and eliminate traitors, and especially to the construction of a new democratic China. This is undoubtedly a great and invincible force!

"Hunger is power" (Guo Moruo) This power will become a pillar of international anti-aggression; a fortress of the world's anti-fascist struggle!

Our China, because the poor families account for the vast majority of the population, is also due to the invaders giving us many poor disasters, which have become the main factor for us to fight for national survival. At present, the hungry people have not only turned in hungry China and fallen into destruction, but have bravely participated in the struggle to resist Japan and save the country. Struggle is the only way out to win the liberation of the Chinese people. We must mobilize and arm this vast mass and work hard to resist the war.

There is no historical example of fleeing from the struggle because of hunger; there is no example of giving in and surrendering to the invaders because of hunger! On the contrary, hunger has set off an uncontrollable revolutionary mobilization!

China has suffered such a cruel disaster, and the vast people are in the sea of ​​hunger, which has increased their love for survival. In order to maintain the life of the motherland, they have given the invaders a strong resistance and set off a huge wave of national salvation. It doesn't matter if you are hungry, go and save the country!

To solve our own and everyone's hunger, we should rescue our entire nation from the great wave of national salvation!

Hunger is an urgent problem, but saving the national crisis is the first way to remedy hunger!

Resistance is the way to fight for the free life and construction of the Chinese people. The Chinese people must defeat aggression and obtain the rights to independent survival and freedom in the resistance war!

### I Devote Myself to the Motherland

— Jin Yi

—Still a story about a girl—

Jingwen pointed out things of interest from home, her behavior sometimes younger than her age, but Qingzhi disdainfully went to sleep on her bed, ignoring her. She was always thinking in her heart that the quarantine officer would realize her mistake and agree to let them all go ashore immediately.

Her fantasy was never realized, and they were still on the ship until dark. Some people know how to pass the time. Some businessmen were gambling and drinking in the hall; and some businessmen who ran the docks had already dressed up, waiting to seize their first spoils of victory. They walked to the deck and looked at the calm sea, with a few fishermen's lights swaying slightly. But when they walked to the other side, they saw amazing scenery, all kinds of lights decorated the mountain city, and the sea left a brilliant projection, winding and winding, as if hanging straight to the bottom of the water. A boat passed by, disturbing the golden shadows, but soon they returned to their old appearance. The night just covered up the ugliness of this city, but it was decorated very beautifully by the lights of thousands of homes.

"Don't you like Daocheng?"

"I won't like it, because it's not ours."

She really didn't like this city, and she hated this city even more after only three days of staying here.

She always remembered those words. When they had just arrived on the shore, a friend who came to pick them up jokingly said to them:

"You have to be careful when walking here. If you are hit and killed by a car, you will only be compensated 50 yuan. If you spit on the road, you will also be fined 50 yuan. The price of a person is equal to a mouthful of sputum."

According to her observation, she even felt that a person was not as valuable as a mouthful of sputum. She once saw a hawker by the roadside, whose goods were kicked to the ground by a police officer. When the hawker went to grab them, he was also kicked to the ground. He was not a stone, so he wouldn't make the police officer's feet feel pain; he just fell uselessly to the ground, groaning, living Having seen the same scene; but she had never seen such a fierce police officer, nor had she seen such a person who did not dare to gasp for breath.

But here, since the fall of Shanghai, many people have come. In addition to most of the passers-by, a large group of wealthy idlers also came. Because of the speed and agility of the plane, people in high positions thousands of miles away can still come here to recuperate their bodies and minds. Here are people, and there are people there; but few people think of our suffering compatriots under the iron hooves of the invaders, and in the north and south, there are our warriors fighting the invaders with flesh and blood.

"They should enjoy it, because they have money."

Invisibly, it seems that a God here is proclaiming loudly that people who grow up here, or people who have passed middle age, are used to it, and their fire has been smoothed out by life; but she was originally full of power and wanted to destroy herself in order to make more people happy. It is really impossible to bear it here. She asked herself anxiously from time to time: "Could it be said that I am greedy for this comfort? Could it be said that I am not used to living under the rule of foreign races? Could it be said that I have also forgotten my brothers and sisters in suffering? 【To be continued】

### My Thoughts on Patriots

— Sima Sheng

I read the original book of "Patriots" a long time ago, and I had many feelings to express; but at that time, many people were mobilizing to translate it, and there was a grand situation, and it seemed inconvenient to chime in. Recently, I saw several translations sold on the market, and I couldn't help but feel mixed emotions, so I had to express them.

My feeling about "Patriots" is that I was not "moved to indignation" like some people said. Pearl S. Buck's novels, to be fair, are nothing remarkable; especially her description of Chinese affairs is simply ridiculously superficial. Her description of Chinese peasant life in "The Good Earth," although it can "sell savage heads to Westerners," always reveals many flaws when read by our own people. However, because she is a Westerner, this recognition seems to be enough to make readers admire her (I don't know how many more superficial works there are in the Chinese literary world than hers!). And the reason why she was able to "cause a sensation in the American publishing world," "make a fortune," and even win the Nobel Prize is probably for this reason. With such a writer with insufficient understanding, to describe such a great scene, such a turbulent era, and such a complicated subject matter, it is certain that it will not be good. Therefore, the failure of "Patriots" is an expected thing, and it is originally "not worth mentioning." However, such an unremarkable work has not only "caused a sensation in the American publishing world" this time, but also "mobilized a large number of cultural people to translate and promote it." But it was a bit unexpected.

I think the shortcoming of "Patriots" is to avoid difficulties and take the easy way, avoid the important and take the light way, and avoid the complicated and take the simple way. Since the scene of this story includes the major changes in China in the past ten years, the emphasis should be on depicting the Chinese people reflected by those changes; since it has been expanded to the Anti-Japanese War and even after the retreat from Hankou, then it should be described The Chinese people's heroic resistance to the war that shocked the world. However, due to the author's lack of experience, she skipped those important factors. Therefore, we rummage through the original book and find that almost more than half of the space is used to describe a love story; and in the small half of the space, there is no effort to describe and render it, but try to avoid all actual scenes as much as possible. This is the biggest shortcoming I have discovered.

In addition, the author writes very vaguely about the characters in the book; this ambiguity is still due to her insufficient knowledge and experience. Wu Yifan and Liu Enlai should be two progressive models, but she wrote them into two legendary figures, not much to take. However, someone thought that there was an insult to China, and I think that was a bit excessive. Although the few paragraphs he excerpted were "voiced" "not out of context," I think they misunderstood the original meaning. "The author expresses the Tongzhou Incident in this way" is to describe the shameless propaganda in Japanese newspapers. "The author... chose this unfortunate thing and satirized it," and satirizing the Chinese Air Force and Army, is to describe Yike's traitorous consciousness and traitorous theory. This seems necessary in novels, because the characters in novels will not be heroes, and everyone is a good person. There will always be bad people and negative opinions.

I am not partial to the original author, but I think Pearl S. Buck may be quite sympathetic to China, but because her knowledge is not enough and her experience is not enough, she described it very vaguely, a bit of a trick. If you don't believe me, I can also excerpt a paragraph below!

### Indoor Flower Sales for 7/7 Memorial, 300,000 Flowers Already Pledged, Extended Deadline for Overseas Chinese Groups, Butchers to Suspend Slaughter for One Day on 7/7, Essay Contest on Resistance War by Student Aid Society Women's Group

In order to strengthen the general public's awareness and belief in our resistance war, and in commemoration of the second anniversary of the 7/7 Resistance War and National Construction, Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, in addition to observing a day of vegetarianism in accordance with the central government's order, will also hold various commemorative activities to expand the commemoration and raise huge sums of money to help the dead and compatriots who have suffered from the war. Indoor flower sales are the greatest collective fundraising event by the Overseas Chinese community. Flower sales began on October 26, and the original deadline was yesterday.

It is reported that from the 26th to the 30th, the number of flowers claimed by Overseas Chinese groups and schools has reached nearly 300,000, and the number of registered Overseas Chinese groups and schools has reached more than 590, but less than half have claimed flowers.

### Pui To Girls' Middle School Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday

Guangzhou Pui To Girls' Middle School held the 13th graduation ceremony for senior and junior high school and the 2nd graduation ceremony for primary school at the Kowloon branch of the YMCA yesterday (30th) at 1:30 PM.

### School Overview

Time flies like flowing water, and another day has passed. The students of each school, after the final exams, have begun their summer vacation. At this time, primary school students are promoted to middle school, and middle school students are seeking further education. Some students also want to transfer to a more convenient school. In order to facilitate the students in the above situations and provide them with a basis for choosing a school, this is the motivation for us to publish this summer school overview.

Pui Ying Middle School

Guangzhou Pui Ying Middle School was founded exactly 60 years ago. Initially, there was only one branch school in Hong Kong. Later, due to the fall of Guangzhou, the number of students gradually increased. Due to environmental needs, the school buildings for primary and secondary schools and kindergartens have now increased to more than five. The first is the senior high school administrative office (9 Conduit Road), the second is the senior high school second school building (75 Robinson Road), the third is the junior high school administrative office (Kau Yan Church, High Street), the fourth is the junior high school second school building (6 Tiegang), the fifth is the primary school administrative office (84 Bonham Road). There are more than 400 senior high school students and more than 300 boarding students. Each teacher in the school is only responsible for teaching one subject, which is considered to be their special responsibility.

The school has close ties with domestic universities, and many senior high school graduates with excellent academic records have gone on to study at domestic universities over the years. There are more than 120 graduates in the current senior high school class, breaking the record for the number of senior high school graduates in Guangdong Province.

The school is now recruiting new and transfer students for the autumn semester in each grade of senior and junior high school, spring semester transfer students for the first and second grades of junior high school, and spring and autumn semester visiting students for each grade.

Registration procedure: Students who wish to apply can first go to the senior high school (9 Conduit Road) or the junior high school (Kau Yan Church, High Street) and (6 Tiegang) to obtain a registration form. After filling it out, submit it along with two 2.5-inch bust photos and a registration fee of one yuan to the registration office to retrieve the admission ticket for the examination on schedule.

The subjects for the examination are Chinese, English, Arithmetic, and General Knowledge (General Knowledge includes Civics, History, Geography, and Nature, etc.).

Tuition fees: The annual fee for junior high school boarding students is 159 yuan, and the fee for non-boarding students is 78 yuan. The annual fee for senior high school boarding students is 169 yuan, and the fee for non-boarding students is 88 yuan.

Because the school is run by a church, it pays special attention to moral education.

### Chinese Amateur Alumni Association Promotes Summer Life and Holds Literary Evening on July 1st

### Motorcycle Rider Not Inoculated, Macau Jockey Club Reschedules Racing. Jockey Club's Request for Accommodation Denied, Must Wait for Hong Kong and Macau Consultation Before Scheduling Can Be Determined

The Macau Jockey Club's July horse racing was originally scheduled to be held tomorrow. However, the health authorities of Hong Kong and Macau are cooperating closely to implement emergency epidemic prevention regulations. Passengers traveling between the two places must be inoculated against cholera six days in advance and obtain a certificate from the Port Health Department of Hong Kong before boarding the ship. The Jockey Club, considering that some of the riders had not been inoculated in advance, was deeply concerned that they would be detained and therefore intended to ask the health authorities of Hong Kong and Macau for accommodation, whereby the Jockey Club would issue its own certificates or certificates issued by the field doctor inoculation clinic, which the Jockey Club would then certify. The person in charge of the Jockey Club held this request to the Macanese health authorities, who agreed to accept it, but the Hong Kong Port Health Department did not want to change the regulations. The person in charge of the Jockey Club, being unsuccessful, believed that it would not only be inconvenient for visitors to Macau, but also difficult for some riders, and therefore decided to postpone the July horse racing until the Macanese authorities had fully consulted with the Hong Kong authorities before notifying all sectors of the rescheduled date. It is reported that there were originally six races scheduled for the start of the race on July 2nd, including a one-dollar big raffle case to commemorate Mr. Potts of the Jockey Club. This raffle had a large number of tickets sold in Hong Kong and Macau. Now that it has been rescheduled, the sold raffle tickets and cover tickets will be fully valid when the race is held.

### Pui To Girls' Middle School Graduation Ceremony Celebrated

— Luoxia

"Lingering in Pui To for another three autumns, memories linger, green fills the window, the taste of books is forever, the sound of Qin zhao is separated by flowers, gathering red lychees on the branches, no one buys a boat to return, the corners of the earth and the horizon are expected to meet again, the weeping willows in the post pavilion add to the sorrow." This is a graduation song, this is a graduation song sung at the 13th graduation ceremony of senior and junior high school and the 2nd graduation ceremony of primary school at the Guangzhou Private Pui To Girls' Middle School. After all, most people are emotional, and who is ruthless? After many years of studying together, once we part, everyone's heart will naturally have a sour taste. However, in the midst of the sad farewell, these many graduates can solemnly express the lofty responsibilities given to them by the motherland. If they can do this, it will not be in vain for the school's cultivation, nor will it be in vain to be a good daughter of the Chinese nation.

The twelve graduates of the senior high school spring class and the twenty-six graduates of the senior high school autumn class were all wearing silk ribbons and sitting on the stage with vigor. The remaining thirteen graduates of the junior high school spring class and the forty-three graduates of the junior high school autumn class, as well as thirty-odd primary school graduates, and some guests and students, completely filled the auditorium of the Kowloon branch of the YMCA. The latecomers mostly sighed at the small space, and it was extremely lively.

Ambassador Zhuang Zexuan gave a speech on "The Discovery of Man," from hard work to intellectual training and personal cultivation, introducing his personal practical life experience from his student days to the present to this group of graduates who are about to leave school and move on to another new stage. This is very precious.

Finally, Principal Wen Yaobin gave a speech, raising two questions to the graduating students: a review of the past and a vision for the future, hoping that all graduates will be down-to-earth and move forward bravely, becoming the darlings of the times and not being left behind by the times.

### "China Relief" Offers Precious Contribution Before Departure: "By the Yongding River" Performance Tonight Depicts a Tense, Exciting, Wonderful, and Great Story of July

Before "China Relief" goes abroad, it is scheduled to perform "By the Yongding River," "Earth Tribulation," and "Blood Splattered Peach Blossom" at the Lee Theatre for three days from today to the day after tomorrow. This performance is a charity fundraiser for the Women's War Disaster Relief Association, so it is of particularly great significance. After this performance, "China Relief" will go to the Philippines and then to the United States.

Drama in Hong Kong has no status, and drama comrades are very fragile because of various inconvenient conditions. But since "China Travel," "China Arts," and "China Relief," which are mentioned in this article, came to Hong Kong, the drama movement in Hong Kong has begun to play an active role. In particular, "China Relief," with its perfect and refined performances, has given Hong Kong overseas Chinese a new understanding and new interest. Some time ago, "China Relief" successively performed "Spring in Taierzhuang," "Long Live the Nation," and "Defend the Motherland." Tickets were sold at the lowest prices of one dime, two dimes, and four dimes, accommodating many overseas Chinese and giving them an opportunity for a new perspective. It would probably be impossible for a theater troupe that specializes in making money to offer this lowest ticket price, but "China Relief" did it. From this, we can know the spirit of hardship of the comrades of "China Relief." This alone is enough for everyone to admire.

As for this performance, it has such an origin, and I will explain it here. "China Relief" was originally scheduled to go abroad at the end of June, but due to the ship schedule, it was postponed to July. It will probably be able to go abroad nationally within seven days. After the last performance, various community schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon requested a repeat performance one after another, but they declined because they were too busy preparing to go abroad. However, when the Women's War Disaster Relief Association arrived in Hong Kong, they first welcomed and invited cooperation to raise funds for the refugees, so "China Relief" finally fulfilled its promise before going abroad, and thus there was this huge task of three consecutive days of performances.

This performance will be more exciting than before. One is the expansion of the scenery, the second is the proper preparation, and the third is that the selected scripts are all the best works of "China Relief." As for mobilizing all the members of the troupe, that is inevitable.

I would like to say to the overseas Chinese, if you want to feast your eyes and clear your mind, please take the time to go and see it. This is not only about watching a play, but also about knowing that our War of Resistance will be victorious and our national construction will be successful. "China Relief" uses drama to illustrate the brilliance of the new China, which is what the overseas Chinese are most happy to understand. Therefore, overseas Chinese should not regard "China Relief" as an ordinary theater troupe, but should have a deeper understanding of them. Moreover, this performance is to raise funds for disaster relief. Buying one more ticket means saving one more life. It is really good to donate to entertainment.

### Valuable Contribution of "China Relief" Before Farewell: "By the Yongding River" Performance Tonight Depicts a Tense, Exciting, Wonderful, and Great Story of July

### Farewell Address for the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe's Charity Performance

— Pan Lang

The "China Salvation" Drama Troupe's overseas tour for publicity, passing through Hong Kong, has left an extremely deep impression and a naturally good feeling among people from all walks of life in Hong Kong. I remember the last time they gave a charity performance at the Lee Theatre, although it was raining continuously and there were no temptations of "powder and rouge," they were able to break the Hong Kong box office record. Furthermore, many audience members, with enthusiastic hearts, were left outside the theater, disappointed due to "full seating." This is the glorious record that the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe has left in Hong Kong, and it can also be said to be a "guidepost" for all theater movement workers in Hong Kong! Now that the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe is about to embark on their overseas publicity tour, they are holding a final charity performance before their departure. The content of this charity performance includes "By the Yongding River," a play written by the National Playwrights Association depicting the Lugou Bridge Incident; "Cataclysm of the Land," a play written by Tian Han, Zhang Min, Hong Shen, Zhang Ke, and others, recreating the reality of China during the war of resistance; and "Blood Splatters on Peach Blossoms," a collective creation by the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe depicting the historical traces of the war of resistance in southern Shandong. This charity performance aims to raise funds for the Hong Kong Women's War Relief Association to aid wounded soldiers and refugees. I believe that the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe will be able to maintain and promote the glorious record they created last time, and I further believe that they will strengthen the determination of Hong Kong theater movement workers to "make drama serve the war of resistance and nation-building!"

The "China Salvation" Drama Troupe was born and grew up under the × people's gunfire. The "China Salvation" Drama Troupe has also traveled tirelessly to various frontlines and the vast rear. After this "final charity performance," they will go to the Philippines and then to the United States. I hope and believe that the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe abroad will, based on what they have seen and known, use art to raise the national self-esteem and self-confidence of our vast overseas Chinese compatriots in the manner of a "petrel," and call on every overseas Chinese who does not want to be a slave to contribute their vivid or material strength for the independence of the motherland, the liberation of the nation, their own happiness, and the final victory of the war of resistance and nation-building. This is the first point. Secondly, the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe's organizational life and attitude are known for being "serious, tense, united, and lively," which can also be said to possess the basic conditions for a public salvation publicity effort. This time, going abroad, they should further play a model role among overseas Chinese, especially in overseas Chinese salvation organizations, drama and general cultural organizations. It is not only about mobilizing, but also about organizing overseas Chinese. The war of resistance and nation-building are entering a new, even final, critical juncture. Overcoming the difficulties and dangers of this juncture mainly relies on the organization of the vast public. The overseas Chinese, who bear the honor of being the "mother of the revolution," are of almost decisive significance in this regard. This is the second point. In addition, in coordination with ××'s new strategy of destroying China with "military as auxiliary and politics as the main," ××××, as well as elements who are oblivious to conscience, stubborn, and selfish, are colluding in a despicable manner, using the slogans of peace and anti-communism to undermine the unity of the entire nation, to undermine the active, comprehensive, and protracted war of resistance, in an attempt to divide and then conquer China. Their evil hands are also spreading in various parts of the country, and naturally, they are even more frantically waving among overseas Chinese. We must raise the vigilance of overseas Chinese regarding ××'s activities, guard against and consolidate and expand the united front, and give them a merciless blow.

It is precisely on the eve of the second anniversary of the Chinese people's heroic war of resistance that we are seeing the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe perform "By the Yongding River," a story depicting the Lugou Bridge Incident! The battle by the Yongding River was the first protest by the Chinese nation against the long-term ×× fate, the first time the Chinese nation recognized that "sacrifice had reached the final juncture," and that "'compromise midway would be equivalent to complete surrender," and it was also the first time the Chinese nation united to launch a full-scale war of resistance to safeguard the integrity of territorial sovereignty. Two years later, we are gradually moving away from danger, and the sun is sinking deeper and deeper, while Wang Jingwei and the overt and covert traitors who echoed Wang Jingwei's traitorous rhetoric are attempting to establish a "anti-communist" court by concluding treaties of national betrayal on the bodies of hundreds of thousands of soldiers who have heroically sacrificed and millions of refugees who have been displaced! After seeing this performance by the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe, we will surely increase our ×××××××××× and strengthen our determination and confidence in supporting the central government and supporting Chairman Chiang to complete the war of resistance and nation-building. ×××××××××× is the day when true peace and final victory will appear! I hope that the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe and Hong Kong theater movement workers will work together to strive for the early arrival of this day!

### The Vanguard of War of Resistance Drama

— Huang Dacai

The "China Salvation" Drama Troupe is about to go abroad.

This sentence has become a topic of conversation or writing material for theater workers and cultural circles at present.

Before going abroad, and while the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe is performing to raise funds for the Women's War Relief Association, I would like to take advantage of this valuable space to say a few words.

The members of the "China Salvation" Drama Troupe are theater workers, so of course, they cannot help but talk about their profession. However, it would be more accurate to call it a war of resistance drama movement. Drama has its universality and knows no borders. American song and dance films, sexually suggestive films, fascist invasion films, and anesthetic films cannot deny that they are not drama. However, the object is different, and the effect has dangerous tendencies. For example, if we currently take sexually suggestive films, song and dance films, invasion films, and anesthetic films as our drama and release and spread them, then the impact would be unimaginable. Because the audience is anesthetized, they lose their vigilance, do not know how to invigorate themselves, and do not know how to contribute to the country. If this continues to develop, the result will be the danger of national subjugation and racial extinction!

Understanding this point, we can know the urgent need and necessity of war of resistance drama. The significance of war of resistance drama is to concretely use various different techniques to weave the great and arduous project of war of resistance and nation-building, the magnificent and heroic deeds of war of resistance and nation-building, through the scope of drama, into an effect of edification. To arouse emotional resonance and promote unity of purpose. Its ultimate goal is to devote all efforts to supporting the war of resistance and nation-building, and to devote all efforts to resisting the only current enemy — the Japanese militarists.

What I have said above is only the minimum principle of war of resistance drama. Drama that violates this principle does not deserve to be called war of resistance drama. In the most arduous and most serious war of resistance and nation-building drama, there is only "national policy first" and "war of resistance first." Therefore, for drama that violates the war of resistance and nation-building, we can put forward the task of criticism, but at the same time, we should take out our own "goods."

The "goods" of "China Salvation" are genuine and courageous war of resistance drama. In the past, present, and future, they will always maintain one principle and one belief, which is "nation above all" and "victory above all"!

In the meantime, "China Salvation" is prepared to do its best, no matter where it goes. It can be guaranteed here, and it is firmly believed, that "China Salvation" will never, in a moment of joy, perform a song and dance or sexually suggestive drama of the same kind as American song and dance films and sexually suggestive films; nor will it be as brutal and ferocious as fascist invasion films and anesthetic films that violate the times. The war of resistance drama of "China Salvation" is righteous and embodies the supreme truth of survival. Every nation in the world that wants to survive, every nation that resists aggression, should have the necessity to see the war of resistance drama of "China Salvation," and should have the necessity to participate in the war of resistance drama of "China Salvation."

Today, the fascist evil hands are preparing and have already used bloody hands to seize the nations that want to survive. In the West, there are Germany, Italy, and Franco, and in the East, there is ××××'s Japan. In some countries, they are afraid of the power of fascism and seek compromise, while we are bravely giving blows to those who give blows. We have resisted the Japanese militarists for as long as two years, smashing the × people's poisonous plan of quick battles and quick resolution, quick battles and quick peace.

Therefore, the Chinese nation is the outstanding nation of the world, and the Chinese nation has already fought a fierce vanguard battle for the democratic countries for two years.

"China Salvation" has been tempered and grown up in these two years of blood and flesh. "China Salvation" has already taken its own genuine, courageous, and valuable "goods" all over the north and south war zones, edifying thousands of soldiers and civilians. Now, going abroad, in a word, is to directly tell overseas Chinese the belief that the war of resistance will surely be won and the nation will surely be built, and at the same time, bring the enthusiasm and strength of overseas Chinese back to the motherland to jointly strive for victory.

The "China Salvation" Drama Troupe is about to go abroad.

This sentence has become a topic of conversation or writing material for theater workers and cultural circles at present.

But I must appeal on behalf of them: In Hong Kong, in domestic cultural people, theater workers, and people from all walks of life, please give "China Salvation" enthusiastic support.

Jin Shan said: "If we are sentries, then we hope that the cultural circles at home and abroad, and all compatriots in the country, will be our backing, teaching and guiding us!".

### Launch the Overseas Chinese Drama Movement!

— Hu Chunbing

Our overseas Chinese scattered all over the world are a strong pillar of the war of resistance. In the overthrow of the Manchu Qing dynasty and the national revolution to overthrow the feudal warlords, they have done their utmost. After the July 7th Incident, they showed even greater strength. This is inevitable. Without extensive mobilization of the manpower and material resources of overseas Chinese, our national general mobilization cannot be considered complete. Without the overseas Chinese returning to serve the country and actively transporting supplies, the victory of the national liberation war will certainly not be as fast as we expected.

However, the cultural level of overseas Chinese is too low, and they lack spiritual sustenance. They are too far away from the struggle of the motherland, and their daily spirit also lacks nourishment. At this time, the most powerful medium that can popularly and vividly report the news of the motherland's struggle to them, portray the faces of 400 million people seeking liberation, solve their intellectual hunger, and organize their service emotions is art, it is the drama art that is truly alive and pulsing, it is the war of resistance drama art that has been forged in the flames of war.

Two

Since the start of the war of resistance, the Wuhan Chorus has been able to not only self-sufficient in Southeast Asia, but also remitted a large amount of funds to the central government. The efforts of Lingren Xindu in the United States and Southeast Asia have added many ambulances to our front lines. Recently, even the smallest places in Southeast Asia have drama troupes, and many famous domestic dramas have been staged.

Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and other places not only have more enthusiasm for saving the country, but also have improved their need for and ability to appreciate art.

Three

Now is the best opportunity to launch the overseas Chinese drama movement. Should

(1) Report on the struggle of the motherland for liberation and construction of a new China;

(2) Portray the glorious deeds of overseas Chinese in the history of the Chinese revolution;

(3) Introduce domestic war of resistance scripts so that everyone can come into contact with new content, and from this content, increase their understanding and closeness to the motherland;

(4) Demonstrate and guide so that war of resistance drama movement has positions everywhere, with small stations, medium stations, and even general stations;

### Ode to "China Salvation"

— Cicada's Cry

I sing of "China Salvation" with enthusiasm full of emotion, just like singing of heroic and glorious soldiers fighting for the land of the motherland!

A group of heroic drama warriors, struggled for nearly a dozen months, experienced many hardships, traveled all over the north and south battlefields, thousands of miles of war-torn journey, stepped across the boundless mountains and fields, and finally, with glorious practical experience, went to distant overseas to declare the war of resistance of the motherland. This indomitable spirit and courage is not a sketch in words, nor is it false talk, but a living reality, a genuine work that has been tempered thousands of times! !

How worthy is this excellent and great worker who serves the motherland's war of resistance of being praised by every Chinese son and daughter!

The Hong Kong drama movement has never blossomed with such brilliant sparks, just like the light that has shone on our theater scene in the past two months; but "China Salvation" has given us the source of the fire that burns brightly. In these two months, how has the drama climax in Hong Kong surged to its peak, and how have all the people, the people who love the motherland, been swept up in the drama frenzy!

China Salvation has written a page of immortal history for the Hong Kong theater scene. They have performed four times, shattering the dreams of those who have always despised drama, and putting the real deeds of benefiting the front-line battles of the motherland on stage with the skills of drama art, strengthening the people living under red lights and green wine's knowledge of the × people. This kind of realistic art that actively contains national defense and war of resistance consciousness has made great contributions to the national liberation struggle!

This performance is the last finale in Hong Kong, and it is also a roaring reproduction. Soon, the sea waves will take them overseas, taking the experience of real life and the spirit of work, informing the overseas Chinese compatriots that the motherland will not succumb, and our nation will live forever on our land!

Their past and future are all fighting under the banner of the motherland's war. May the spirit of "China Salvation" exist forever with the eternal life of the motherland.

### "China Salvation"'s Gift

— Zhu Baishui

One

I often have a kind of silent expectation that is not easily understood by others, especially recently, confined to the sickbed by a minor illness, the mood of regret filled my heart.

I knew the news of "China Salvation"'s final performance in Hong Kong long ago. Of course, it was an exciting thing, but at the same time, I deeply felt infinite confusion!

——The tail of the final performance will lead them away from Hong Kong and to overseas!

In terms of personal friendship and work learning, the departure of "China Salvation" from Hong Kong seems to be a regrettable loss. Although they will probably return to their homeland soon, in any case, the distance makes friendship and learning temporarily separated and alienated.

This separation and alienation will make a person who deeply and quietly cherishes rich friendship feel confused and embarrassed.

However, who can easily stop this group of travelers who are ready to go? For the sake of declaring the great national self-defense war of resistance of the motherland, they are heroically shouldering a not insignificant burden to the overseas Chinese!

May they have a pleasant sea journey after the end of this performance!

Two

Sometimes, when I wake up in the middle of the night, I silently think of many things; what makes myself even more immersed is looking out at the motherland with flames of war everywhere. On that vast land, the × people cruelly trampled on our ancestral graves and workshops, but encountered great unexpected resistance and counterattacks! Oppression and slaughter have made the weak and timid strong, and the young generation is growing up more heroically in constant struggle.

"China Salvation" developed and grew up in this way in the arduous national liberation struggle. For twenty months, they carried props, costumes, and stage equipment, galloped across the north and south battlefields, came and went in bombings, struggled in hardship, and exerted the most excellent force of wartime drama art. In continuous work and continuous training, they became a strong force of drama workers in the war of resistance.

Carrying the hardships of their journey, leaving the land of the motherland, shouldering the great mission of publicity and fundraising overseas, the sea vessel took them to Hong Kong, the first stop of this international publicity, and temporarily stayed in this colony.

The wartime drama movement in Hong Kong took a new turn after the Customs Long March Troupe came to Hong Kong in May 1938 and performed "Frontier Storm," and the Zhonglv came to Hong Kong in mid-September for continuous performances. However, without more abundant inducements, stepping into 1939, we began to have new life. The arrival of "China Salvation" has advanced the entire Hong Kong theater scene to a high tide, no doubt, China Salvation is powerfully ignited Hong Kong's theater Beacon!

During this period, the entire Hong Kong was swept into a dramatic situation. This power is definitely not something that other teams can easily do, nor is it something that other teams can achieve by pretentiousness or exaggeration.

The achievement that "China Salvation" gave to the Hong Kong theater scene is to completely and clearly point out the practical gains of the excellent workers tempered from the great war of resistance in the motherland! !

Three

The theater scene in Hong Kong has always been regarded as abnormal by people and has never been valued by the idle. They feel that this is a childish game or a boring tool for war of resistance slogans. This kind of "drama" that is not valued is naturally not worth spending time on, and it is even more impossible to spend money on it!

"China Salvation" heroically rescued them, rescued this group of people wearing yellow-tinted glasses, sincerely guided them to appreciate a true entertainment belonging to art, and even told them in a sophisticated and magnificent performance: the motherland is struggling to turn over and seek national freedom and independence in such hardship, how cruelly our ×× is looting on our ancestral graves and fields… making them startled, and making them weep, but even more angry and fanatical!

At this point, China Salvation has eliminated the deep-rooted negative psychology of those who despise and despise drama.

Similarly, people engaged in drama work in Hong Kong feel depressed, feel that there is no way out, and feel that the future is bleak. In particular, they seem to think that war of resistance drama cannot make money in Hong Kong and cannot be staged professionally. Therefore, they cleverly avoid reality and hope to stage drama for the sake of art.

However, China Salvation answered them sternly, war of resistance drama is not that it cannot make money, it is not that it cannot be staged by professional groups. The problem is that excellent art has not been put into the atmosphere of war of resistance drama. War of resistance works that have passed through the artistic form will never be without soul and will never be without audience love. We cannot completely say that the performance of "China Salvation" is 100% superior, but in the enthusiastic desire of the audience, we can estimate how their performance is expressed.

Four

How moved we are by this warrior who grew up on the land of the motherland - it seems that we no longer need to use beautiful words or odes to participate in the body of China Salvation. A noble hero will hide under the shade of a big tree and silently recall his own battle exploits…

Really, China Salvation needs more frank and sincere opinions.

I am surprised, why is it that their great performances in Hong Kong have never seen more precise and correct criticisms? At least, the friends of China Salvation must also feel that there are many things that they have not done well. People who admire them are so admiring them, but why don't they more sincerely and accurately tell them some good things they already know or don't know?

By doing so, I believe it will make "China Salvation" grow even more progressively.

China Salvation has taught us many things, often in many situations. I am too moved, they are so serious and hardworking about their work, and so enthusiastic and sincere about friendship. Many memories that are not easy to forget will be forever remembered in my own memories.

May these many touching memories make me often remember this heroic warrior!

1939, June, 30, in illness.

### Postscript

The China Salvation Drama Troupe will start its large-scale farewell 746th charity performance at the Lee Theatre again today. In order to give a more detailed report on their performance and to make a more objective assessment of their work in Hong Kong for the past three months, this issue of our magazine will meet with our readers one day in advance.

Regarding China Salvation, we have repeatedly spared no expense in our space. From the editor's point of view, on the one hand, we are standing on the position of the salvation drama movement, hoping that the Hong Kong drama movement will become more prosperous because of the stimulation of their arrival; and on the other hand, we are impressed by the "China Salvation" troupe's serious and thorough work spirit of sacrificing everything for national liberation, the indomitable, courageous, hardworking, and strong perseverance, the simple and sincere high enthusiasm, the strict, solid, and democratic organization, the strict work discipline, the diligent and tireless spirit of learning, and the arduous and enduring struggle life… all of these are worthy of our learning and promotion.

For any individual or any group, we have one wish: to make fair criticisms, to absorb their strengths, and to discard their weaknesses. We will unconditionally do our best to promote good and bright things. We will also examine the bad things without hesitation; but blind support and unreasonable abuse are not taken by true workers. As for the achievements, work spirit, and work attitude of the "China Salvation" comrades in the war zone for twenty months and in Hong Kong for three months, I think there is no need for me to say more.

Now that "China Salvation" is about to leave Hong Kong, Mr. Jiang Ming proposed at the farewell dinner for "China Salvation" held by the Yelian Society that this publication be the place for future communication and contact between "China Salvation" and Hong Kong drama workers. On this point, the editor is very happy to do his best to hope that China Salvation will often contact us after leaving Hong Kong, and that Hong Kong drama workers will also hope to more enthusiastically use this space of this publication!

### The July Ablaze with War

— Wu He

Regarding the Banks of the Yongding River

It is July again, a most memorable and worthy time to celebrate. The Chinese nation, having endured seven years of humiliation, stands tall and strong on this land, ready to vent seven years of pent-up anger and rise to be its own master!

In July two years ago, the first shot at Lugou Bridge made every Chinese person who refused to be a slave stand up straight, tears of joy streaming down their faces. We all jumped up excitedly, saying everything we had not said for seven years with great satisfaction, and with a mighty voice, doing everything we had not done for seven years—no, for forty years. The Chinese nation began to break free from its shackles, fighting for our nation's freedom with blood and flesh!

Oh, the laudable July!

The descendants of the Chinese nation should be doubly inspired and work doubly hard in July! So that the heroes of Lugou Bridge can smile in their graves, and the incomparably brutal ×× can collapse more quickly!

In July two years ago, the National Playwrights Association called on all Shanghai playwrights to perform "The Banks of the Yongding River" in Shanghai, hoping to sow the seeds of the Lugou Bridge struggle in Shanghai, where we have lived for many years, and to ignite the torch of national liberation struggle already raised on the banks of the Yongding River in Shanghai!

Today, in Hong Kong, to commemorate July, we are making "The Banks of the Yongding River" the first program of this charity performance. We are immersed in deep memories: the tense atmosphere throughout the country at that time, the enthusiastic emotions, the determination to fight, and the heroic actions, all feel as vivid as if they were happening now. These intimate feelings and circumstances are precious. Today, we want to use this play to convey to the audience, so that the audience can take a historical mirror to look back at the early days of the war of resistance, and be alerted and encouraged.

This time, "The Banks of the Yongding River" has an "Overture" added to the beginning. This "Overture" was originally a one-act play, but it is difficult to evoke deeper emotions in the audience when performed alone. Now added to the front of "The Banks of the Yongding River," it may make the play slightly more complete, while this one-act play has gained new life because of it.

A friend said very well about this "Overture": "It's like a history textbook." This lesson outlines the situation from September 18th to Lugou Bridge: Dongshan Province was forcibly occupied, Rehe was plundered, the father's tolerance, the son's anger, and the duel at Lugou Bridge (original: Pingjin) are all symbolically written out. This is truly a lesson in history, and it is a history that we should read! Especially today, on the second anniversary of the War of Resistance, we must be familiar with the course of × people's aggression against China since September 18th. Remembering the past is precisely to encourage the future.

It is said that this play is being performed for the first time in Hong Kong. Place it in front of the "Overture" and let it meet the audience in Hong Kong for the first time. In the July ablaze with war, the audience can glimpse from this play the surging anti-Japanese actions like waves two years ago, and the anti-Japanese will as strong as steel, and feel that the "Overture" is helping the integrity of the whole play, then "Since September 18th" still has fresh life today!
