### Soviet Union Reaffirms Foreign Policy

— Jiansheng

On the evening of May 31st, Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov delivered an important speech in the parliament regarding the Soviet Union's attitude towards the current international situation, providing a very frank explanation. It will undoubtedly have a significant impact on future international developments and China's war of resistance, which is something we cannot ignore.

Firstly, Molotov reiterated the Soviet Union's foreign policy as reported by the Soviet Union's highest leader Stalin at the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in March, specifically solemnly declaring the "resolute opposition to aggressors" and the "resolute assistance to invaded countries fighting for national independence." Molotov first severely condemned the recent provocations and conspiracies by the Japanese puppet troops against Outer Mongolia, and seriously warned Japan, saying: "The Soviet Union's determination to protect the borders of Outer Mongolia is as firm as its determination to protect its own borders... Our patience also has its limits. If the Japanese and 'Manchukuo' authorities are aware of the times, they should promptly cease their incessant intrusions into the Soviet-Mongolian border!" Molotov then solemnly stated: "You are certainly aware that Stalin's statement is about assisting invaded countries fighting for national independence. This statement is fully applicable to China, which is fighting for national independence. We have been constantly implementing this policy in practice, and it is also fully in line with the principle of the Soviet Union organizing a united front of peace-loving countries against aggression in Europe. We do not want to place excessive or special trust in this declaration by the Soviet diplomatic authorities, but we cannot but recognize that this declaration by the Soviet diplomatic authorities is distinctly different from that of other capitalist countries, especially fascist aggressor countries. This lies in the development of the Soviet national economy, the strengthening of national defense, the complete unity and cooperation from top to bottom, and the increasing international credibility, that is, the consolidation and development of the political and material strength of the socialist spirit and morality, which have become a guarantee for this declaration. Therefore, we can predict that the provocations of the Japanese puppet troops against Outer Mongolia will suffer an even greater blow than the Zhanggufeng Incident last year and expose their ugliness; and the active progress of Soviet aid to China will be more than just containing the Japanese puppet troops stretching for thousands of miles along the border between Puppet Manchukuo and Inner Mongolia! From our country's standpoint, in addition to rejoicing and gratitude for this clear and enthusiastic expression from the Soviet Union, we should redouble our efforts to promote the cause of cooperation between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union for democracy and peace, and strive to urge Britain, the United States, and France to work together in this great and sacred cause, in order to jointly resist the enemies of democracy, peace, and human civilization—the fascist aggressors!"

Secondly, in response to the joint proposal by Britain and France to conclude a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Molotov reiterated the clear and firm position of the Soviet Union on this matter. We have repeatedly pointed out the errors in the subjective speculation made by the general public about this negotiation, and pointed out that both the empty optimists and the malicious doomsayers have exceeded the facts, because the financial capitalists of Britain and France have not placed the interests of their country, nation, and world peace above their private class interests, nor have they thoroughly realized the great significance of completely abandoning the "half-hearted policy" at present. Therefore, in the recent joint proposal to the Soviet Union, in addition to the significance of demonstrating to the aggressors and alleviating the anti- ×× sentiment at home, it still lacks the basic elements for actively and effectively completing the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union and the anti-aggression front. Moreover, the delay in time has given the aggressors an opportunity to take advantage of and exaggerate the propaganda of "Britain and France fully accepting the principles of the Soviet Union's proposal" in an attempt to shift the blame for failure or delay the actual responsibility. Both of these points cannot be ignored. Now Molotov reiterated in his speech Stalin's warning that "the Soviet Union will never pull chestnuts out of the fire for others." When Molotov reported this, all the representatives cheered and applauded thunderously. Key political, military, and diplomatic personnel such as Stalin, Voroshilov, and Litvinov also participated in the cheering, which lasted for five minutes. From this, it can be seen that the Soviet Union's serious attitude today will serve as a serious lesson to all delaying, wavering, and hypocritical tendencies in the anti-aggression movement.

However, Molotov's speech did not increase the difficulty of the negotiations on the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, but powerfully promoted this negotiation in the right direction, prompting it to move towards organizing an effective anti-aggression front and establishing a path to collective security. Molotov re-declared the basic principles of Soviet diplomacy, saying, "The Soviet Union thoroughly advocates uniting all peace-loving countries to jointly resist aggression." Molotov also re-declared the Soviet Union's enthusiastic and serious attitude towards the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, saying, "The Soviet Union insists that the tripartite mutual assistance agreement must be of an absolutely defensive nature, guarantee all Soviet allies, and establish a specific agreement that if one of the signatory countries is attacked, the other signatory countries must provide substantial assistance." These two points not only clearly prevent Britain and France from using the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as a tool to seek "victory" in negotiations with Germany and Italy, but also, regarding the part where Britain and France admit to bearing mutual responsibility in the British and French proposal, point out that this "further step" by Britain and France can serve as a prerequisite for the possible completion of the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in the future. It also actively taught Britain and France that only by fully basing the collective security system in Europe and even the Far East on the principles of the Soviet Union's proposal can they truly and effectively prevent and defeat the fascist aggressors. We believe that Molotov's speech will undoubtedly increase the international credibility of the Soviet Union's peace policy, will undoubtedly increase the fighting courage and determination of the vast masses of people in various countries, and will also increase the awareness of the progressive parties and even the government authorities in Britain and France, and move towards the path of a truly effective anti-aggression united front. This also refutes the unfounded malicious doomsayers who are pessimistic about the cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union and the anti-aggression movement.

The re-declaration of Soviet foreign policy will undoubtedly further enhance the credibility of the Soviet Union's policy of safeguarding peace on a global scale, and will undoubtedly further encourage the development of the anti-aggression united front of all democratic peace-loving countries and oppressed and invaded countries. Our China, which is bravely resisting aggression, should seize this favorable condition in the international situation to strengthen our unity and struggle.

### Life of Overseas Chinese in the War of Resistance: General Situation in Siam, Vietnam, and Malaya - Speech by Dong Shuhua, Member of the China Walking Corps

[Kuala Lumpur Correspondence] Dong Shuhua, Chen Fuyuan, Cai Shunqin, and other members of the Nanyang team of the China Walking Corps, having traveled through seven countries for seven years, recently arrived in Kuala Lumpur. In response to the joint invitation of Tsun Jin High School and Kuen Cheng High School, they delivered a speech at 2:30 pm in the Tsun Jin Auditorium on the experiences of the corps' walking journey and the conditions in various places, and held a film exhibition. More than 900 male and female teachers and students from the two schools attended the event. After the chairman gave a welcoming speech, Dong Shuhua was invited to speak. The following is an excerpt from his speech:

Overview of Annam

After we ran out of Zhennan Pass, our footsteps stepped onto the land of Annam. As everyone knows, this country, which has been a tributary state of our country for more than 2,000 years, had its territory and color lightly changed in 1884 when Li Hongzhang concluded the Treaty of Tianjin with the French envoy. Moreover, when we lost this tributary state, our army, led by Cen Yuying, Governor-General of Yunnan and Guizhou, and Feng Zicai, Brigadier General of Guangxi, went out of the pass and fought against the French army, successively recovering several famous cities. In Liangshan, they even defeated the French army utterly. When the news of this defeat reached Paris, the French government and the public were greatly shocked, but the news of our army's victory was delayed in reaching Beijing. Li Hongzhang was a master of negotiation. Regardless of the situation on the front lines, he hurriedly concluded a peace treaty, recognizing Annam as a protectorate of France. The relationship between our country and the tributary state of Annam was thus severed. Perhaps it is impossible to find a second case in world history where land was lost even after winning a battle.

The residents of Annam include Annamese, Cambodians, Thai people, Chams, Laotians, and mixed-race Annamese and Chinese. Among them, the Annamese account for seven-tenths of the total population and are the largest ethnic group among the ruled. Their race belongs to the Mongoloid race. Their clothing retains the style of the Ming Dynasty in our country. The brick and tile houses they live in are also similar to those in our country. Their food is mainly rice, and their dishes are nothing more than fish, meat, and vegetables. Their language and writing have been influenced by our country. Originally, Chinese was commonly used. The sentence structure of the language was also the same as in our country. Later, the French authorities Latinized the literature and writing and explored it as the national language for Annam, only then abolishing Chinese. However, the elderly Annamese still recognize Chinese. Other ceremonies for weddings, funerals, and celebrations generally follow our country's customs. The people's quality, integrity, and perseverance are undoubtedly the result of being immersed in our country's culture, which is how they became an excellent nation.

The subsequent ethnic groups, such as Cambodians, Laotians, Thai people, and Chams, are all ethnic groups that invaded with superiority. Later, they gradually developed and scattered throughout various parts of Annam. Their way of life preserves a certain habit. If we have the opportunity, we will elaborate on them one by one. For the time being, we will omit them. As for the mixed-race people of Chinese and Annamese descent, their customs and habits are exactly the same as ours, but legally, they have partially become Annamese.

At present, France governs Annam, with a Governor-General as the chief executive, responsible for implementing the policies of the entire colony in terms of politics, military affairs, diplomacy, judiciary, society, and finance. He resides in Hanoi. There is also a Deputy Governor-General in Cochinchina. The remaining provinces, such as Tonkin, Laos, and Cambodia, each have a garrison commander or special commissioner who is directly under the control of the Governor-General in Hanoi. Although the original imperial family and tribal chiefs still use their original titles, they are all nominal and have no possibility of exercising power. In the past few decades of French rule, there have been three histories of national struggle. Initially, the Annamese royal family and landlords opposed the rule of imperialism, leading the people to rise up and resist the French army. The second was a collective force of farmers demanding improved living conditions. The third was the people suffering from the pain of national subjugation, rising up to demand national liberation. However, none of the three national struggles were successful. We understand that only by uniting with the small and weak nations of the world can nations oppressed under iron hooves achieve true liberation and equal treatment. Therefore, the people of Annam are now eagerly looking forward to our country's victory in the War of Resistance.

Because France restricts the inflow of foreign capital, the development of commerce in Annam is very slow. At present, some ethnic groups still use barter trade, but in urban areas with convenient transportation, ordinary commerce is generally controlled by our overseas Chinese compatriots, which is indeed a superior position compared to other ethnic groups. However, most of the imported goods are French products. The goods from our country exported to Annam are really pitifully small, accounting for only 1% to 2%. The reason is that France adopts a "home country centrism" for its colonies, which is the opposite of the "free trade doctrine" adopted by Britain for its colonies. Therefore, unless it is a necessary commodity, they will definitely restrict the import of foreign goods to the extreme. Therefore, the sale of our country's goods in Annam is negligible. Other major industries, such as agriculture, fishing, etc., are also controlled by the French, and Chinese have very few investment opportunities.

Our overseas Chinese compatriots in Annam are still free to engage in national salvation work. The Annamese government has not interfered with fundraising, donations, and public services.

Overview of Siam

Siam is a world-renowned rice-producing country, gaining a large amount of production due to its endowed fertile land and suitable climate. In addition to self-sufficiency, most of the surplus is sold all over the world. Even in the southern provinces of our country, a lot of rice is imported from Siam every year. In addition to rice, which ranks first among exports, followed by tin, then wood, rubber, mineral products, fisheries, and other agricultural products, 95% of the commerce and economic lifeline of Siam is controlled by our overseas Chinese. All export merchants, large and small shops, are run by our Chinese. The proportion of inferior goods sold in the market is as high as 60%, and our domestic goods account for only a little over 20%. Since the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese have truly awakened and implemented a boycott of enemy goods from top to bottom, giving the aggressors a fatal blow, which can also promote the sales volume of our domestic goods. This is a gratifying phenomenon. However, due to the decline in trade, the Japanese have tried their best to induce the Siamese government to build high tariff barriers to exclude Chinese goods. The recently announced revised tariff regulations are to specially increase the tax rate for the import of Chinese goods, as a preliminary step to completely exclude Chinese goods. The pressure of tyranny cannot shake the patriotism of overseas Chinese. Although it cannot be carried out publicly on the surface, the results of the secret promotion are becoming more and more significant. At the same time, a group of passionate young people have organized assassination squads and iron-blooded corps to do sacred and inviolable work. Although the Siamese authorities are very strict in preventing and arresting them, the passionate young people are still moving forward bravely without retreating. This situation makes the shameless traitors and the traitors who have lost their souls hide themselves in time. The Japanese hate this situation, and they have forced the Siamese government to treat our overseas Chinese unreasonably. For example, last year, they arbitrarily arrested more than 5,000 law-abiding overseas Chinese on the pretext of smoking offenses and sent them back to China. The second time, they arrested more than 3,000 overseas Chinese, saying that they did not have identity documents with them, and deported them back to China. The more overseas Chinese are subjected to all kinds of unreasonable abuse, the more their patriotism burns like a raging fire. We personally heard an overseas Chinese in Bangkok say: "The motherland is our place of return, and our status abroad will naturally increase accordingly. Otherwise, if the country is destroyed, everything of ours will also be over. So, are people who do not love the country human beings?" This remark is the motto of overseas Chinese living under someone else's roof. I sincerely hope that overseas Chinese who do not reside in Siam can also understand this profound meaning, and do their best to protect the country. If the country is strong, it will also protect our overseas Chinese living abroad. Otherwise, won't it be the same as the Jews? I am afraid that there is no place for the people of a perished country to stand. As for Siam, although it is superficially striving to strengthen national defense since the change of government, in fact, it is nothing more than a superficial show. If our country wins the War of Resistance, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not bow their heads and get close to us."

Overview of North Malaya

We ran into North Malaya from Siam, first inspecting Kedah, and then passing through Wellesley, Penang, Perak, and arriving in Selangor. Although we have traveled many times, because these places are all within the scope of British Malaya, the social dynamics are almost the same. However, it is an unavoidable fact that the world's economic depression has affected Malaya. There is unharvested rubber, inactive tin mines, and iron boats. Abundance is originally beneficial to consumers, but the long supply is greater than the demand, causing the value to fall. This is the mistake of a state of anarchic production. The use of methods to limit the production quota to restore the falling price means that the profits of capital and landlords have not lost much, but it has been difficult for the laborers. The opportunity to work is only one in a thousand, and the rest are unemployed, starving and complaining. Starving to death is indeed free. At the same time, the sharp increase in the number of unemployed people naturally reduces the purchasing power of the public. The economic situation is also difficult to recover. The living conditions of ordinary laborers are even more unimaginable. However, laborers are very enthusiastic about national salvation work, which is really admirable. Although Chinese schools in North Malaya are quite developed, due to the environment, the spirit of so-called wartime education is simply nowhere to be seen. As for the future of overseas Chinese here, we are really worried. The reason is that the economic development in the past has reached its highest point, and there is also the concept of factions that is indestructible. If they achieve some success, they will tacitly agree and be satisfied. Moreover, in recent years, they have been attacked by the huge forces of others. If they do not unite and fight, they will only decline.

Finally, we must protect our leader, resist aggression to the end, strengthen the national united front, and strive for the final victory!

### × Troops' Attempt to Force a Crossing of the Xiang River Fails; We Directly Attack ×'s Rear Base; New Developments in the Battle Situation in a Few Days

[Haisha Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Since the small-scale clashes near Tianmen Yuejiakou since the day before yesterday have developed into fierce battles, there was a time when 400 Japanese troops secretly crossed the west bank of the Han River, but were driven back. Although no detailed reports have been received from the front line recently, it is impossible to predict the Japanese military's operational plan, but general military observers believe that the Japanese military is engaging in "clearing" the Tianmen Yuejiakou Zaoshi area, which would allow the Japanese military to cross the river and attack the west. However, the Chinese army has long seen through their tricks and is now carrying out mop-up operations against the remaining enemies in Zhongxiang, preparing to break through the rear base of the Japanese military in Xinyang Anlu in one go. Because the Chinese army is advancing rapidly, there will be new developments in a few days. Moreover, because the Chinese and Japanese armies in Hubei Province are using ingenious strategies to break through each other, there will inevitably be a new situation in the war in that area. However, the Japanese military has become a tired division after their disastrous defeat. However, because it is impossible to count the strength of the two armies and their distribution plans, it is really difficult to predict the future battle situation. As for the Xiangbei front, it is still silent. According to Chinese reports, two Japanese detention ships and eight steamships entered Dongting Lake the day before yesterday and docked near Yueyang.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 2nd] According to Chinese sources, the recent counter-offensive by the Chinese army in Hubei Province is making good progress. The Japanese army is now retreating towards Yingcheng and Jingshan, abandoning a large number of military equipment.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 1st] On the morning of May 25, about 500-600 × infantry and cavalry from Zhangdian ×, with four cannons, invaded Yunwan in the southwest. After we divided our troops to ambush them from Shangxia Shaogu, after five hours of fierce fighting, the × were unable to hold on and retreated to their original position. In this battle, more than 100 × were killed. On the 22nd, about 700-800 × from Zhangdian, Shuitou, Xiaxian, Guo Wei, and other places invaded Qimu Village south of Wenxi, and were ambushed and repulsed by our troops. At noon on the 26th, more than 100 × infantry and cavalry invaded Xiaoyajiao from the south of Hengshui, and were intercepted by our troops on the way. They also destroyed four miles of highway and two bridge machines in Dongyao. A unit of Jinxiang × in Fensi moved eastward towards Linfen and was intercepted by our troops, killing more than 100 ×. Currently, our army is besieging Jinxiangzhong.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 2nd] Near 10,000 × troops gathered in the Zhongyang Lishi Fenyang area, occasionally engaging in small-scale activities westward. Our river defense troops have taken strict precautions. On May 28, more than 1,000 × troops passed through Yeshanqiu (from Zhongyang to the south) and were ambushed on the west side by our troops. They fought fiercely all day long, leaving dozens of bodies behind. On the east side, more than 200 × troops from Heilongguan disturbed Dongpoli and Guanjiazhuang at noon on the 29th, and were repulsed by our ambush troops. On the evening of the 29th, a certain powerful unit of ours raided the × in Jinfangling and captured or killed more than a dozen of them.

[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 1st] At noon on the 27th of last month, about 80 × troops in Shangbai Town (under the jurisdiction of Wukang County) held morning exercises. They were discovered by Pi Shengquan, a soldier of our unit. He crawled forward. When he was at a considerable distance, he threw grenades fiercely. When the smoke cleared, flesh and blood were flying everywhere. More than ten × troops were killed. The remaining × troops retreated in a panic, fleeing in all directions. The soldier returned to his team calmly, believing that his mission had been accomplished. Upon receiving the report, the authorities commended the soldier for his bravery and resourcefulness in defeating the many with the few and will issue an order of commendation.

The Breakthrough of the Lone Army on Mount Lu

[Central News Agency, Ji'an, 1st] Yang Yuchun, the commander who held Mount Lu, came to Ji'an for official business. According to his account of the breakthrough from Mount Lu, I led the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the Jiangxi Security Corps, undertaking the guerrilla task in the Mount Lu area. In the past ten months, we fought with the × more than a hundred times, large and small. The × suffered more than 5,000 casualties, and more than 30 officers, including the liaison officer, were killed. The × consumed tens of thousands of artillery shells and more than 3,000 bombs. We also captured several mortars, more than 20 machine guns, and more than 500 rifles and pistols. The × constantly deployed two regiments on the periphery of Mount Lu on major transportation roads and densely laid barbed wire to implement a blockade, but it was often destroyed by us, resulting in great losses. This time, in order to eliminate the rear of Mount Lu, the × gathered a force of about one division, with six aircraft and more than 100 artillery pieces, to attack Mount Lu on four fronts on the dawn of April 16. After fierce fighting until late at night, dozens of hand-to-hand combats were fought, killing a regimental commander and more than 600 soldiers of the ×. In this battle, our casualties were also heavy, and all fortifications were destroyed. In addition, because of our weak forces and the inability to replenish them, we decided to break through. We have now transferred to a certain place and continue to engage in guerrilla warfare. Before the breakthrough, we destroyed the entire Mount Lu Power Plant. The breakthrough time was the evening of April 18. We passed through the × area. When we encountered the ×, we only used bayonets in hand-to-hand combat and never fired our guns. Therefore, the × never discovered the main target of our force, and we were able to safely reach our intended destination. During this long journey through the × area, the civilians rushed to help us carry the wounded and lead the way. From this, it can be seen the high level of resentment and hatred of the × among the civilians in the × area. Finally, I said that I was deeply guilty to the country and the compatriots for my improper command, which led to the fall of the famous mountain. Thanks to the leniency of my superiors in not pursuing the matter, I will sacrifice everything and continue to kill the × and sacrifice for the country.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 2nd] On the morning of the 31st, a certain unit of ours launched a counter-attack against the × in Zhangjia (south of Nanchang, east of Xincun), capturing a lot. They immediately captured the area south of Zhangjia.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 2nd] On the morning of the 2nd, there were four × field guns in Hucun, north of Shabei, shelling Zhanggunao (two kilometers north of Xiangfuguan) in Yaozikou. At the same time, a large number of × aircraft assisted in the bombing. Our positions were unchanged.

### × Prisoners of War in Shaanxi Comfort Our Wounded Soldiers; Speech Exposing the × Country's Difficult Situation

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 1st] The number of × soldiers captured by us is very large. They have all been sent to detention centers and reformed. Most of them have awakened and are extremely resentful of their warlords. Therefore, they are extremely admired for the heroic resistance of our soldiers. The entire prisoner of war detention center here sent a representative, Oshikiri Goro, to comfort our wounded soldiers at the ×× Hospital at 11:00 am on the 1st. After reading the letter of condolence, he thoroughly exposed the tyrannical situation of the × and the difficult situation in the × country. Finally, he joined our wounded soldiers in shouting "Down with the Japanese warlords."

### Overseas Chinese in Honolulu Send a Letter to the Soldiers of the Nation, Wishing to Provide Material Assistance and Serve as a Backing for All Soldiers

A Letter from the Honolulu Overseas Chinese Patriotic Soldiers' Comfort Association to Various Newspapers at Home and Abroad, Forwarded to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing, General Li Delin in Fancheng, General Zi Jiansheng in Guilin, General Zhu De in Yan'an, and All Commanders and Deputy Commanders of War Zones and Guerrilla Forces, for the Attention of All Soldiers Fighting the War of Resistance: Since the outbreak of the war, the entire nation has been united in anger and engaged in arduous struggle for two years. You have either raised your arms on the highlands or shed your blood in the wilderness, fighting countless battles, large and small, without regard for your own lives. Your heroic deeds are shining brightly, and your loyalty is deeply moving. If Xuanyuan were to rise from the earth, he would surely nod his head in approval. The majesty of the Chinese nation has been truly displayed, and you can truly breathe a sigh of relief. Relying on this common blood, you are washing away the defilement of our rivers and mountains, without permitting any turning back. You bear the heavy responsibility entrusted by the nation and sacrifice for the sake of the people. As long as the last drop of your blood has not flowed and the great responsibility of every citizen has not been fulfilled, there is no need to worry about success or failure. Only maintain your determination, disregard survival or death, and only know to advance. Practicing compassion while unleashing slaughter, who can remain unmoved? Fighting against aggression with courage, who is without righteous indignation? We and others dwell in foreign lands, but long for our homeland. We wish to provide material assistance and contribute to your divine efforts. Looking westward to our homeland, we are filled with heroic ambition. Considering the difficulties of the times, we earnestly pray for your efforts. Your heroic spirit has been suppressed for too long. We express our sincere feelings with this special telegram of comfort, hoping for your understanding.

### The Central Government Solemnly Commemorates the Centennial of the Opium Prohibition of June 3rd, the Anti-Opium Association Sends Personnel to Broadcast Propaganda, and Chairman Chiang Personally Drafts and Issues an Instruction

[Chongqing Central News Agency Dispatch, 2nd] The third day is the anniversary of the day when Lin Zexu, the late Qing dynasty official, burned opium at Humen. It was previously designated by the central government as the Opium Prohibition Commemoration Day, and commemorative measures were formulated and promulgated. This year, the 63rd year, happens to be the centennial of Lin Gong's burning of opium. The Anti-Opium Committee of the Ministry of Interior and the Chongqing Municipal Government, considering that the deadline for the prohibition of opium smoking is fast approaching, and also that it is now the time to implement the National Spiritual Mobilization, have agreed to invite various agencies to hold a commemorative ceremony on the morning of the 3rd. At 7:20 PM in the evening, the Anti-Opium Committee will send personnel to the Central Broadcasting Station to broadcast speeches. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang and the Minister of the Interior will also personally draft and issue instructions and speeches, respectively.

### Our Government Establishes a Trade Commission in England, with Guo Taiqi as Chairman, to Promote Sino-British Commercial Relations

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The Chinese authorities recently established a "National Government Trade Commission" in London, with an office on Gracechurch Street. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to England, is the Chairman of the Commission. Bernard, Guinnes, Wang Jingchun, the Director of the National Government Purchasing Committee, Li Jun, the Assistant Manager of the Bank of China, and Guo Bingwen, the representative of the Chinese Minister of Finance, are members of the commission. Guo also serves as the Executive Director of the commission. He told a Reuters reporter, "The purpose of this commission is to promote economic and commercial relations between China and England, to find sales channels for Chinese goods in England and other markets, and to provide advice to Chinese manufacturers purchasing British machinery. In the future, the role of this commission in China's purchases of goods in England will be similar to that of a bank's settlement office. We deeply hope that this commission will be a most valuable organization. The need for British cooperation in China's construction work is increasing day by day."

Brief Commentary

### [June 3rd] Centennial Anniversary

Today is the centennial anniversary of the June 3rd Opium Prohibition. Chairman Chiang has issued an important instruction. Every compatriot who is spared the disaster of being poisoned in the Japanese-occupied territories and lives in a 'land of peace' should repeatedly recite the instruction of the supreme leader.

In our brief commentary, we must intensify international propaganda, using concrete materials to expose the inhumane policy of the Japanese bandits and traitors to poison the population. We must also redouble our efforts to fight against the traitorous plot of poisoning. At the same time, we must especially support the supreme leader's instruction to completely eliminate opium in the country. We must wash away the corruption, darkness, and decline of our great China, advocate a life of 'tension, rigor, unity, and vitality,' and work together for the new birth of China.

### American Ambassador to Go to Chongqing

American Ambassador Johnson arrived in Hong Kong from Shanghai yesterday and is scheduled to go to Chongqing today to meet with our government authorities and inspect the southwestern provinces.

The importance of the United States' position on the Far East issue is a well-known fact. The seriousness of the threat to the United States from Japan's step-by-step encroachment, and the particularly active support work for China in the past two years, are also well-known facts. However, the current even more serious situation is that Japan is shamelessly sending overtures to the United States, while its offensive is thoroughly excluding all British, American, and French interests in China. The United States should pay even more attention to the great significance of our country's insistence on resistance, and the great significance of the United States' call to organize a Far Eastern anti-aggression front. We hope that the American ambassador's trip to Chongqing can make efforts on this point, first of all, to help the preliminary work of the anti-aggression front, that is, to accelerate the movement of American aid to China and the sanctions against Japan.

### Nobel and Oikawa Hold Talks on the Izumo Battleship, Discussing Various Pending Issues Regarding British and Japanese Navies

[Reuters, Shanghai, 2nd] The British Far East Naval Commander Nobel and the Japanese Fleet Commander Oikawa held talks this morning on the Japanese flagship Izumo, lasting three hours. It is reported that British-Japanese naval incidents were discussed, including the "Lanpura" being investigated, the "Sigli" being detained, the situation on Gulangyu, and navigation issues on the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. However, the details of the talks are currently unknown.

[Chongqing Central News Agency Dispatch, 2nd] A Shanghai dispatch reports that British Far East Fleet Commander Nobel and Japanese Naval Commander Oikawa held talks on the Izumo battleship on Far East British-Japanese naval issues. Although the attitudes of both sides were quite frank, it has not been possible to reach an understanding so far, so the situation between Britain and Japan has not changed due to the meeting.

British Military Attaché Detained, Britain Negotiates with Japan

[Associated Press, London, 2nd] Lieutenant Colonel Spindler, the military attaché of the British Embassy in China, was detained by the Japanese army in Zhangjiakou. The British authorities in China are now negotiating with the Japanese military authorities on this matter, requesting the immediate release of Spindler.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 2nd] It is learned that Mr. Lin, the Chinese secretary of the British Embassy, and Major Dalama left Beijing yesterday for Zhangjiakou to investigate the detention of Lieutenant Colonel Spindler by the Japanese army. According to reports, after this incident occurred, the British authorities immediately sent Lieutenant Cobber to Zhangjiakou to investigate. As of last month, there was no report on Lieutenant Colonel Spindler.

Japanese Side Again Threatens the British Authorities in Tianjin

[Haitong News Agency Dispatch, Tokyo, 2nd] It was announced here yesterday that the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, Tashiro, sent a note to the British Consul General Jamieson, requesting the British Concession authorities to hand over the murderers of Cheng Xigeng, as the case occurred in the British Concession. He also said that if the Japanese authorities do not receive a satisfactory reply within seven days, they will take free action.

The Gulangyu Issue Is Still Under Discussion

[Chongqing Central News Agency Dispatch, 2nd] A Tokyo foreign dispatch reports that a spokesman for the Japanese Navy Ministry said yesterday in response to reporters' inquiries that the Gulangyu issue is currently being discussed by the diplomatic representatives of the countries concerned in Xiamen. The commanders of the British, French, and American fleets stationed in China are not expected to discuss this matter.

[Chongqing Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st] A Shanghai foreign dispatch reports that a reporter recently inquired with a Japanese naval spokesman about the number of troops the Japanese side has continued to land in Xiamen. The spokesman replied that the exact number is unknown, but it is approximately four hundred.

### Xiao Focheng Passes Away in Siam

Chairman Lin specifically sent a telegram of condolence, saying: "To Mr. Song Jian, funeral director for Mr. Xiao Focheng in Bangkok, I have reverently read the telegram announcing the passing of your esteemed father, and the words he left behind. I repeatedly recite them, and I deeply see his dedication to the Party and the nation. Even at the point of death, he did not neglect his duties. With the foreign enemy pressing urgently, we have suddenly lost an experienced elder. Recalling his life, I am filled with sorrow. I hope you will restrain your grief and assist in the great cause to comfort his spirit. This is my sincere hope. Lin Sen, winter seal."

### He Guoguang Announces New Chongqing Municipal Plan to Avoid Unnecessary Losses from Air Raids and Rebuild the Wartime Capital

[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] According to a plan announced by Mayor He Guoguang of this city, Chongqing will be divided into several small cities, each specializing in the development of industry, commerce, or education. Mayor He said, "This is a good way to reduce the danger of air raids on Chongqing, to avoid the destruction of large numbers of lives and property, and to enable Chongqing to continue to maintain its importance as China's wartime capital."

### Chiang Kai-shek's Address to the Nation on the Centennial of the June 3rd Opium Prohibition

Today is the anniversary of Mr. Lin Zexu's burning of opium at Humen one hundred years ago. It also coincides with the upcoming second anniversary of our country's war of resistance, at a time when the tide of aggression in the world is becoming increasingly turbulent. As we commemorate our predecessors today, we should certainly increase our determination to prohibit opium and save the country, emulating their virtue, and especially we must have the concept of learning from the past to establish the present and striving to strengthen ourselves. At the end of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, the Qing court's internal affairs were corrupt, and the country's strength was weak. Therefore, Indian opium catered to the preferences of the Chinese people and was transported to China in large quantities. At that time, Lin Gong keenly perceived the scourge of opium poisoning and resolutely advocated prohibition with great fearless spirit, saying, "If this disaster is not eliminated, then in ten years there will be no soldiers to use, and no funds to use." The court at that time and the Chinese people today all admire his famous arguments. For a hundred years, our country's opium prohibition has not been thorough. However, after the Meiji Restoration and the various wars, including the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the European War, the violent and strong Japan has been increasingly determined to implement its unchanging continental policy to invade and gradually approach our country. First, it occupied our Northeast, and not satisfied with that, it invaded our North China, Central China, and South China, attempting to destroy our entire nation. We know that we cannot save the country without resistance, and to achieve the purpose of persevering in resistance, we must mobilize the entire nation to implement the spirit of general mobilization. Thoroughly eliminating opium poisoning is the most important item in the spirit of general mobilization. Originally, before the Japanese aggressors' masks were torn off, they had already done their best to manufacture highly addictive drugs, such as morphine, heroin, and red and white pills, or dispatched ronin to take advantage of their special influence to smuggle and transport them everywhere, or even dispatched their treacherous merchants to establish factories for manufacturing drugs in places under consular jurisdiction and Japanese military protection to produce them in large quantities to poison our people. This fact is known to the world. Since occupying our vast territory, they have become even more blatant, unscrupulous, and actively expanding their poisoning policy. Wherever the Japanese troops arrive, all opium dens and drug addiction centers are openly opened, and they even force our people to smoke opium. Their intention is nothing more than to turn our entire Chinese nation into opium smokers and drug addicts, forcing them to become moribund, not only without the spirit to resist but also accelerating their death and preventing them from reproducing. We must know that if we want to resist to the end and strive for final victory, we must need a large number of soldiers to replenish us. If we do not eliminate opium, how can we have a large number of strong men to replenish the front lines? Lin Gong's saying, "No soldiers to use," was only a prediction to be prepared for danger in times of peace when there were no maritime troubles in those days. In today's all-out war, we feel the importance of the actual relationship even more. Before the War of Resistance, I was specially appointed by the Central Committee to concurrently serve as the Chief Supervisor of Opium Prohibition to handle the opium prohibition affairs of the whole country, and I had already drawn up the most complete plans for prohibiting planting, prohibiting transportation, prohibiting sales, prohibiting smoking, and prohibiting drugs, setting the deadline for complete eradication by the end of the 29th year of the Republic of China. In recent years, due to the tension of the War of Resistance and military affairs, the opium prohibition agencies, although adjusted at the same time as other central agencies, were originally intended to separate the nature of the affairs and make each agency responsible for its own duties, in order to accelerate the promotion of opium prohibition, and not to relax in the slightest. (Central News Agency. To be continued tomorrow.)

### Minister of Interior Announces the Main Points of One Year of Opium Prohibition Administration

[Prohibition of Planting] All opium-growing provinces and regions in the country, except for those that have fallen, have already set limits or prohibited planting in advance within the 27th year, and changed to planting food crops. Yunnan also only has a small number of opium fields in the 14 counties of Zhenkang, Lancang, etc., which border Burma and Vietnam or where the natives have not been civilized, and are temporarily allowed to extend the prohibition to the 28th year. During the opium-planting season, each provincial government is responsible for sending personnel to conduct thorough surveys, and personnel are sent from some districts to report violations.

[Prohibition of Transportation and Sales] The Ministry believes that it is difficult to eradicate the malpractices of private transportation, private sales, and private smoking under the old system of managing commercial transportation and sales with ad valorem taxation, so it advocates the implementation of unified collection, unified transportation, and specialized plaster sales. This plan is still being handled by the Ministry of Finance.

[Prohibition of Smoking] Various provinces and cities have achieved considerable success in registering smokers, issuing permits, and implementing phased and batch-based abstinence methods. The Ministry has formulated measures and detailed rules, which have been submitted for approval and implementation. Smokers under the age of 45 are required to abstain within the 27th year, and those over the age of 45 are required to abstain within the 28th year. Self-abstinence methods are also promoted. In addition, methods for provinces, cities, and counties to establish forced-abstinence factories have been formulated and submitted to the National Government for promulgation and implementation. These methods stipulate that factories should be established everywhere to specifically receive and labor for smokers, providing food, accommodation, and medicine, while abstaining from smoking and learning skills.

[Special Funds for Opium Prohibition] Various provinces and cities have misappropriated funds from time to time. Special Management Regulations for Opium Prohibition Funds have been drafted and approved by the Cabinet for implementation, ordering provinces, cities, and counties to establish independent opium prohibition and abstinence funding, strictly implement the budget system, and absolutely prohibit misappropriation.

[Abstinence Medicines] There are many kinds of medicines sold on the market, and there are many malpractices. The Ministry of Health is responsible for preparing good abstinence medicines, and the Opium Prohibition Committee is responsible for unified control and management. As for the recovered areas of the war zone, thorough eradication methods have also been formulated in order to complete the central government's entire opium prohibition plan.

### Go to Tongguan - The Words of Seven Brave Warriors

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya

Tongguan, strategically located at the communication hub of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan provinces, has been a battleground for military strategists since ancient times. In the current situation of resistance against Japan in the Northwest, its gains and losses are particularly important to the overall situation. To put it more clearly, if it can be firmly held by us for a long time without wavering, then the problems of controlling Henan Province, threatening eastern Henan, echoing Xiangyang, protecting the Northwest, and maintaining the international routes in the Northwest can all be "easily solved" and "achieved together." On the other hand, if it unfortunately falls under the iron hooves of the Japanese, the war situation in the Northwest will inevitably change, and there will be one more difficulty in launching a large-scale counter-offensive in the future. But in fact, the heroic achievements of our brave soldiers in defending Tongguan are truly gratifying and admirable! Since the fall of Fenglingdu on the north bank of the Yellow River last year, the Japanese have continuously launched fierce attacks on Tongguan on the south bank. After our brave soldiers' fourteen or five months of desperate defense, Tongguan has been turned into a victorious cornerstone that is as deep and unbreakable as copper nails and iron pillars!

However, what is the magnificent structure of this cornerstone of victory in Tongguan? How does it exert its power to reverse the decline of the Jin situation in the past and serve as a pillar for the protection of the Northwest in the future? So I jumped on the Longhai train heading east from Xijing with joy and hope to conduct an interview.

Recently, there have been very few empty seats on the eastbound express train. Because the old people who had fled from the war zones near southern Shanxi and western Henan to Shaanxi, seeing that the war situation in the front had improved, suddenly had the idea of returning home, depositing their children in the Baozhouyuan orphanage in Shaanxi or at friends' places, and lightly packing their bags to return home. These farmers, still wearing old cotton-padded jackets in the hot weather of Xi'an, some were gazing at the wheat fields waving in the wind on both sides of the Fen River, showing a slight smile that had been absent for a long time. Whether they were thinking of the wheat in their fields, which was probably also ripening like this, welcoming them back to harvest, or imagining the joy of having family reunions upon returning home, or recalling the joy of witnessing a Japanese plane shot down in an aerial battle—in short, "a person with such a smile" must have a motivation that is somewhat related to the "return home issue." The return home issue is indeed a universal and serious problem in the minds of 470 million compatriots at the current stage, especially for all the people who have lost their territories in Northeast China, North China, and Southeast China. Those who are fighting in the front lines and those who are displaced in the interior are naturally thinking of returning to their old homes, and those who are living a subhuman life in the occupied areas are hoping that we will quickly fight back to North China, Southeast China, and Northeast China to restore their inherent comfortable and free lives. It is time for everyone to hurry up and work hard, and the beautiful flower of victory in returning home will soon bloom on everyone's peaceful face!

There were also seven glorious wounded soldiers, no, they were brave soldiers who had recovered from their injuries and were returning to the front line. Their ages were all around twenty, and they were in very good spirits, chatting and laughing all the way, and they also had a "happy return to their hometown" attitude. When asked why they were so happy, from their various answers, I learned that five of them were from Sichuan. When they recalled the reasons for their happiness, their fluent and humorous conversation had the remaining charm of Qin Mi, a famous scholar of ancient Shu, who was known for his eloquence, making everyone's eyebrows dance and their faces light up with smiles, forgetting where the train was going.

Some said: "When we set off from Sichuan the year before last, it was already the beginning of winter, but each of us only wore a single coat, and every two people shared a military gray blanket. Sometimes we shivered all over. When we arrived in Yichang and saw the strong men of Hubei wearing new and thick cotton-padded clothes and setting off in the same direction, we straightened our chests and raised our heads even more proudly, especially those who were barefoot stamped their feet hard on the ground to show the special spirit of the strong men of Sichuan. Later, when we went to the snowy and icy Shanxi to fight, we suffered some unexpected losses due to poor equipment, and of course our morale also suffered a considerable blow. Oh! But as we fought fiercely until last year and this spring, our equipment and new weapons became more and more advanced! The Japanese planes and tanks often encountered 'worthy opponents' and did not dare to flaunt their power and act recklessly. … We have been wounded for more than two months, and now we are returning to the front line, of course we will see some new tricks that are even more advanced. Maybe this time we will chase the Japanese 'gouzi' (Sichuan dialect meaning buttocks) all the way and drive them out—if we are not happy about such a worthwhile thing, wouldn't that make us traitors?"

Some said: "The lives of these comrades of ours can be counted as one life worth several, because we have been wounded several times before, but we have not died. Being treated in the hospital is like getting double pay. When we recover and return to the team, we get promoted one rank according to our original rank. I was just promoted from private to sergeant last time, and now I have recovered and returned to the team, I will have to command a platoon. If I have a platoon to command, if I encounter a Japanese company, whether I go 'bumping' them during the day or 'touching' them at night, I am willing to risk my life, which I have picked up several times, with my brothers to establish a miracle of winning more with less. What a glorious and happy thing this is!"

Several others recounted their exciting battles when they were wounded, saying: "They continued to fight fiercely in XX for a week. In the last two days, the food could not be delivered, and they were so hungry that their stomachs growled, and their spirits were extremely exhausted. As long as the Japanese gunfire stopped slightly, some of them would lean against the trenches and fall asleep. However, when they heard the warning sound, they only needed to open their bloodshot eyes with effort, and each of them would glare at the Japanese and fight them fiercely!"

As one said: "In the melee in XX Village, Zhongtiao Mountain, one of the seven soldiers had his rubber shoes pierced by bamboo roots and was tripped to the ground with a foot injury. A Japanese soldier took the opportunity to raise his gun to stab him. The soldier thought he would surely die, but just as the bayonet was about to reach his chest, the Japanese soldier was shot in the back by another Japanese soldier, and he fell to the ground like a hungry dog snatching food. Before he could even say 'see you again,' he went to Fengdu, Sichuan (a folk reference to the underworld) to travel. Another Japanese soldier, whether he was a puppet soldier from the Northeast who was trying to defect, because the second Japanese line saw that the situation was unfavorable and opened fire, was not clearly recognized at the time. But based on the recent fact that puppet soldiers are defecting on various battlefields, it is determined that he must be a conscious and alert soldier."

As one said: "The Japanese bandits in Jin have been constantly attacked by our brave and unpredictable soldiers, making them suffer in silence, so they have become more and more unscrupulous and do not hesitate to use various despicable and poisonous means; for example: when asking villagers for directions or fire, they have to bow deeply; when encountering people who organize gun clubs with ambiguous attitudes, they bow and salute them even more humbly, secretly instigating Mongolian puppet soldiers to brutally kill our righteous and unyielding people, and on the surface, they publicly give a hypocritical show of sympathy like a cat crying over a dead mouse before execution; especially, they post notices everywhere, vainly attempting to instigate ignorant compatriots to capture and kill our patriotic soldiers, saying that anyone who can capture and kill a soldier of the XX army will be rewarded with 20 yuan, anyone who captures and kills a soldier of the XX army will be rewarded with 30 yuan, and anyone who captures and kills a soldier of the XX army will be rewarded with 50 yuan. Although these methods are very insidious, in reality, apart from exposing their delusion of a toad wanting to eat swan meat, it is just that the Japanese themselves have shown their stingy and cheap appearance—because in the current situation where our military and civilians are united and share life and death, even if the Japanese generously increase the reward to hundreds or thousands of yuan, please rest assured that no one will be willing to capture and kill any part of the patriotic soldiers and take the fruit from the Japanese's mouth to ask the Japanese for a reward!"

— Those seven honorary soldiers spoke of their glorious achievements and the various conspiracies and evil deeds of the Japanese as if they were counting their family treasures, making us feel as if we were listening to a wandering poet of the Greek era chanting the heroes of the past; but even more magnificent, they themselves were the creators of this chant, and what was described in the lyrics were the meritorious deeds they had personally experienced. It really made the listeners fascinated and forget where the train was going.

The headlights on the locomotive continued the mission of the setting sun in the western mountains. Its lightning-like flickering light constantly sent black shadows backward, but after passing through XX, it suddenly carefully restrained the light, and every light in the east wing also followed suit and went out. The passengers also breathed in unison. Each of them savored the taste of "going against the odds" of the night march. Only the train, which was not afraid of dangers and was like a wandering dragon, still could not restrain its angry roar of advancing forward. The march of the train, which was so abnormal, was no different from telling us: This is why we have to be so careful; otherwise, it will give the Japanese, who are only a short distance away, a target to shoot at! — At the same time, it is also announcing that the destination — Tongguan, has been safely passed! Why did we have to pass through? Because it is too dangerous there and we can't safely stop and drop off passengers at XX!

### Anglo-French-Soviet Negotiations: Efforts Still Underway for Compromise; Rumor that Britain Will Send Representative to Moscow; France Also Willing to Act as Mediator Again

[Reuters, Moscow, 1st] British Ambassador Sir Seeds met with Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin today for about half an hour. It is rumored that the discussion was related to the Anglo-French proposal. Sir Seeds also consulted with French Ambassador Naggiar. The official Soviet response to the Anglo-French joint proposal has not yet been sent, but British sources here believe that the response will neither reject nor accept the proposal but will, according to Molotov's remarks, clarify the Soviet position. Mr. Grass's speech has been widely published in the Soviet Union, but no newspapers have commented on it.

[Associated Press, London, 2nd] It is reported that British Prime Minister Chamberlain is currently considering sending Foreign Secretary Halifax or Under-Secretary Butler to Moscow to resolve some of the Soviet Union's objections to the Anglo-French proposal satisfactorily. A Turkish military delegation will arrive here soon to discuss Anglo-Turkish cooperation in the Mediterranean and the purchase of war materials. The British General Staff is now preparing to welcome them. The British naval and military attachés in Ankara have also started their journey back home to facilitate relevant negotiations.

[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] The French government believes that the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations will not reach a deadlock and is now acting as a mediator again to resolve the differences between Britain and the Soviet Union. French Foreign Minister Bonnet is confident that a satisfactory solution can be found regarding the Soviet Union's demand for guarantees for the Baltic states. France appears to be disappointed with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech but does not trust the German and Italian governments' claims that the Anglo-Soviet negotiations have failed.

Baltic Key

[Central News Agency, London, 1st] The main difficulty in the current negotiations for the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union lies in the issue of guarantees for the Baltic states. It is rumored that British policy is to send Sterndale Bennett, head of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, as plenipotentiary representative to Moscow to discuss ways to resolve the issue. This issue is becoming increasingly complicated due to the impact of the fortification of the Aaland Islands. The Soviet government recently sent a note to the British government expressing its opposition to the fortification of the Aaland Islands, stating that the islands are located in the Baltic Sea, at the entrance to the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland. If Finland fortifies these islands, the Soviet Union's access to the Baltic Sea from Kronstadt will be cut off, and communication between the Soviet Union and the Gulf of Bothnia will be obstructed. Moreover, Finland's military strength is weak, and there is a great risk that the islands will fall into German hands. If that happens, the Soviet Union will inevitably be greatly threatened. For the time being, the only option is to maintain the current state of the islands and to have the neighboring countries, together with Britain and France, provide guarantees. British government officials say that this kind of guarantee is not something the government is willing to provide. If Finland disregards Soviet opposition and immediately starts fortifying the islands, the current negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will be adversely affected, which is a matter of great concern.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 1st] Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, political figures here recently stated that the issue of guarantees for the Baltic states, namely Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, is the crux of the matter. France seems prepared to offer these countries guarantees, just as it does for Poland, Romania, and Greece. However, some people in London oppose this, arguing that since the Baltic states want to maintain neutrality, and if a war breaks out in that region, the navies of the democracies will be too far away to provide assistance. Britain and France believe that if Germany wants to attack the Soviet Union, it will almost certainly pass through Poland and that it is sufficient to guarantee Poland. So far, Britain and France have not taken a position on this issue for this reason. However, the Soviet Union has the opposite view, believing that Germany is likely to attack the Baltic states and that is why it attaches importance to the fortification of the Aaland Islands.

British Sources Express Optimism

[Reuters, Paris, 1st] Diplomatic circles here unanimously believe tonight that only one important issue remains to be resolved between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and that all other issues are secondary. Although officials have not confirmed what the important point is, it is generally speculated that it concerns the issue of the Baltic states. The Soviet Union's response to the Anglo-French note of last Saturday is expected to be sent on Friday. Diplomatic circles have no doubt that the final outcome of the negotiations will be satisfactory.

[Central News Agency, London, 1st] Regarding Molotov's speech, it is generally believed that it does not contain anything that would prevent the smooth completion of the three-nation anti-aggression pact. The London Times and Daily Telegraph explained Molotov's two misunderstandings, which were (1) the clause on the League of Nations Covenant in the Anglo-French proposal, and (2) the issue of the Baltic states. The Times stated that the British government's reference to the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant does not mean that the proposed pact should be hindered by consultations among members of the League of Nations. The Daily Telegraph stated that the issue of the Baltic states is indeed the most difficult issue at present because those countries are determined to maintain neutrality. However, this difficulty should not be insurmountable.

German and Italian Newspapers Intensify Alienation

[Reuters, Rome, 1st] Roman sources expressed great disappointment with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's speech on the Anglo-French-Soviet defense pact negotiations, calling it nothing short of "pouring cold water" on Britain. Official commentator Gaeda, a spokesperson for Mussolini, said that the democratic bloc contains structural defects and disputes, and added, "The progress of the three-nation alliance, after a long period of haggling, has greatly reduced its value. This is not the spirit in which to create a genuine and solid military pact. In the conduct of the pact negotiations, everyone seeks to gain something without giving anything, and one can only see haggling without any implementation." The Tribune newspaper stated that the basic tone of the British speech was to express distrust, and added, "The pacts of the Axis powers are as solid as steel, and the Soviet Union and the Western democracies can never conclude any similar pact."

[Reuters, Berlin, 11th] Since Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov's speech on Wednesday, German newspapers have abandoned their original belief that the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations would break down and now believe that "the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance debate" will take a long time to resolve. German newspapers paid no attention to the German-Soviet commercial relations mentioned in Molotov's speech, and official circles were unwilling to comment on them. The Hamburgischer Fremdenblatt stated that Molotov was tolerated by those who wanted to encircle Germany and was able to put forward his own views. The Berliner Angriff criticized that a gust of frost had blown from Moscow and compared it with the constructive peace policy of concluding non-aggression pacts between Germany and Denmark, which was based on the strategy of encircling Germany. The Berliner Lokalanzeiger stated that London was greatly disappointed with Molotov's speech, and a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Molotov's speech did not show any fundamental change in the situation.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 1st] Molotov's speech has been treated with reserve by political and official circles here. It is generally believed that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are now exchanging views. Since Germany is not directly involved, its views on the encirclement policy are well known and do not need to be stated again. In addition, with the authorization of the government authorities, some people used a satirical tone to contrast the ease with which the Italian-German alliance was concluded with the numerous difficulties of the current Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations.

Anglo-Polish Agreement Actually Concluded

[Associated Press, Warsaw, 1st] It has been learned from authoritative sources that after a meeting between Polish Foreign Minister Beck and the British Ambassador to Poland at the Foreign Ministry, the Anglo-Polish mutual assistance agreement has been effectively concluded. The agreement stipulates that if one party is attacked, the other party shall immediately provide military assistance.

[Central News Agency, London, 1st] Foreign Secretary Halifax arrived in the capital this afternoon from Chequers and immediately met with Polish Ambassador Raczyński, Portuguese Ambassador Monteiro, and Romanian Minister Tilea. According to well-informed sources, Ambassador Raczyński told Foreign Secretary Halifax that the situation in Europe is currently calm, and the Polish government is not unduly alarmed. However, this state of calm cannot last, and preparations must be made quickly. A British military commission is currently investigating Poland's military needs, especially in terms of artillery and air force. However, the investigation has been going on for a long time, and the report has not yet been submitted, so the amount of credit that the British government can extend to Poland cannot be determined, which is regrettable. It is reported that the British government has ordered the military commission to step up its work and submit its report as soon as possible. It is also learned that Foreign Secretary Halifax and Ambassador Raczyński discussed the issue of transforming the provisional Anglo-Polish mutual assistance agreement into a concrete agreement, and the two sides were very agreeable. In addition, Foreign Secretary Halifax and Portuguese Ambassador Monteiro discussed how to reaffirm the current Anglo-Portuguese alliance.

### Hitler Boasts, Paul Does Not Believe; Germany Indulges in Showing Off Military Might; Yugoslavia Has No Intention of Submitting

[Associated Press, Berlin, 2nd] It has been learned that German Leader Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have both assured Prince Paul of Yugoslavia that the German-Italian alliance is not intended for war and that Germany firmly believes that most European problems can be solved peacefully. The German-Italian talks only discussed various military, political, and economic issues. Although German government leaders have made every effort to strengthen Yugoslavia's ties with the Axis and have attempted to secure Prince Paul's guarantee that he will not enter into negotiations with democratic countries, well-informed sources say that Prince Paul's visit to Germany will not result in a concrete agreement with Germany. German government leaders want to persuade Prince Paul of the value of German friendship and the strength of German military power.

[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, accompanied by Princess Olga and the Foreign Minister, arrived here this afternoon for an eight-day visit. 70,000 members of the Hitler Youth were ordered to line the streets to welcome them.

Editorial

### After Molotov's Diplomatic Speech

Molotov's first comprehensive speech since taking office as Soviet Foreign Minister has had repercussions in Europe and the Far East. It is expected that the international situation will undergo a further development. The content of Molotov's speech can be broadly divided into two aspects: one is the opinion on the Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, and the other is the response to the Far Eastern aggressors. However, viewed together, these two aspects can be said to be the entire issue of the anti-aggression front.

The most important part of Molotov's speech is the expression of doubt about the sincerity of Britain and France in organizing a peace front. Molotov said, "The tripartite mutual assistance agreement proposed by Britain and France to 'resist Nazi and Fascist aggression' is ineffective because of various restrictive conditions." Molotov also pointed out that "the democracies underestimate the changes in the world situation, not only abandoning collective security, but also trying a policy of appeasement; the Soviet Union opposes both of these views." Molotov's speech really hit the nail on the head regarding the hesitation of Britain and France. In the anti-aggression front needs to be established immediately today, Ben has the full necessity. The Soviet Union's real demands are also very simple, as Molotov said: the Soviet government insists that the treaty must be purely defensive and guarantee the concrete treaties concluded by the Soviet Union's neighbors, that if one of the signatory countries is attacked, the other signatory countries will implement aid.

However, since the publication of Molotov's speech, the reactions in Europe, on the whole, are optimistic. Molotov believes that the Anglo-French-Soviet draft treaty is not satisfactory in two points: one is that resistance to aggression must be decided by the League of Nations; the second is that the guaranteed countries do not include the three Baltic states. The British side believes that these two opinions are only different in form, not in substance. Regarding the former point, it is believed that the United Kingdom will not insist on its original intention; regarding the latter point, it is not difficult to find a satisfactory solution: because the Baltic States also need this kind of guarantee. On the other hand, countries that are closely related to this mutual assistance agreement, such as France and the United States, are unanimously advocating that the United Kingdom should concede. According to a Paris dispatch, yesterday, the Paris official level held a meeting with the British ambassador to discuss the issue of the Anglo-Soviet-French treaty. French Foreign Minister Bonnet urged the British ambassador to convey to the British government the Soviet foreign minister's request to extend the guaranteed countries to the Baltic States. Accepted, or completely accepted when the Soviet Union refuses to give in. At present, the biggest obstacle is this. People in the London government have stated that there is no serious disagreement with the consultation of the League of Nations, but they are still reluctant to guarantee the Baltic countries on the grounds that "in law, countries that do not want to accept guarantees should not be forced to accept guarantees." But if the United Kingdom can listen to France's advice and accept the Soviet Union's request, then the three-nation mutual assistance agreement will be realized soon. Even the U.S. State Department is optimistic. According to the speculation of a certain person close to the White House, even if there are concerns about the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union concluding an alliance treaty, the countries that love peace are still under serious threat at this moment, and the United Kingdom will weigh the pros and cons and make a decisive decision. We believe that today, when the aggression of Germany and Italy is intensifying, the British government will not violate public opinion and cause the three-nation treaty to be stranded again!

Another key point of Molotov's speech is the issue of the Far East. Molotov is particularly concerned about China's resistance to Japan, and he emphasized Stalin's declaration on helping the invaded countries and countries that fight for national independence is now fully applicable to China, "We are always implementing this policy." Japan has recently used its deceptive means to divert attention at home and abroad, challenging the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, and expanding its propaganda. But the Soviet Union believes that "it cannot be tolerated" and will protect Outer Mongolia. A point that deserves special attention here is that today, when the Japanese aggressors want to use the challenge to the Soviet Union to alleviate its conflict with Britain and France, the Soviet Union will pay more attention to the Far East issue. Molotov, in his speech, compared the Far East issue with the European issue, saying: "This matter is completely in line with the Soviet Union's work in Europe to unite peace-loving countries to form a common front to resist aggression." Therefore, people around the U.S. State Department speculate that the key to the Soviet Union's unwillingness to accept the Anglo-French draft is the Far East issue. The United States has recently shown an increasing tendency to strengthen its Far East policy, and naturally hopes that this suggestion from the Soviet Union can be accepted by Britain and France. We are eagerly hoping that Britain and France will consider this sentence more deeply: "The peace of the world is indivisible"; Japan's feigned violation of the Soviet Union is only a diplomatic and internal strategy!

### After U.S. Submarine Sinks, New British Submarine Crashes Again; Thetis Sinks in the Irish Sea; Rescue Efforts Being Intensified; Five People Reported Alive

[Reuters, London, 1st] The new British submarine "Thetis" was test-diving in Birkenhead yesterday when, after diving, it failed to resurface. People here were deeply worried about its fate last night. It is reported that the submarine has not surfaced for several hours. The Admiralty is preparing all possible rescue steps. Cammell Laird, the builder of the submarine, said that there were about 20 employees of the company and many Admiralty experts on board. It left the dock at 10 a.m. yesterday, accompanied by an auxiliary ship. The Admiralty received a telegram from the ship stating that the submarine had disappeared. Nearby warships have sailed to assist in the search. The submarine can carry 53 people, with a displacement of about 1,000 to 1,500 tons, a length of 265 feet, and a speed of 15 knots per hour. Its armament includes a 4-inch gun, and six torpedo tubes, with a construction cost of £350,000.

[Reuters, London, 1st] After the British submarine "Poseidon" crashed and sank in Chinese waters, British submarines are now specially built with two escape hatches, through which the crew can escape in case of emergency. In addition, a marker buoy is installed, which can float out of the submarine and to the surface of the sea, indicating the location of the submarine, so that ships on the sea can carry out rescue. Each crew member is equipped with escape gear that provides oxygen. The Admiralty issued a communiqué at 11 p.m. last night, stating that the submarine "Thetis I" had not resurfaced after entering the water at Liverpool at 1:40 p.m. yesterday. There were five officers, 48 sailors, four other officers, and the architects on board, but the number of people is not clear. Many British ships have now arrived at the location where the submarine was last reported, and many aircraft have been dispatched to search before dusk. The patrol will continue today. The first destroyer, the first mine-sweeper, the submarine "Challenger I", and the "Nautilus" and the warship "Valhalla" have all sailed to the scene of the accident at top speed to assist in the rescue. The Chief of Submarine Staff, Mr. McIntyre, has also set off for Jersey to be responsible for rescue operations.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] Cammell Laird announced that the location of the "Thetis" submarine has been found. When the company secretary announced the news to the crew's relatives and friends, the crowd cheered with joy, and some shouted "Thank God." The secretary told Reuters that "Thetis" submarine was discovered by an aircraft that dropped a Class A marker bomb. As for the location, it cannot be announced at present. Twenty-one British ships and other ships are rushing to Liverpool to assist in the search with sea lights and torches in order to carry out rescue. Amateur radio operators used shortwave radios to hear a telegram sent by a rescue ship last night stating that the submarine was seven miles from the Mersey, 180 feet under water, which means that the submarine is about 25 miles from Liverpool.

Generally expected to be close also, it is said that there is enough white air inside the boat for 36 hours for naval officers fearing the or with the sunken ship or other objects on the seabed connected resulting in damaged electrical equipment because there are many sunken ships near the boat under place.

[Associated Press, London, 2nd] Sir Robert Davis, inventor of the famous Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus, told the Associated Press today that the submarine "Thetis" does not have any serious difficulties. The submarine only has mechanical difficulties. The entire crew will do their best to try to resurface. When the "Poseidon" submarine was lost in Weihaiwei in 1931, the "Davis" escape apparatus was used, and it was very effective.

[Associated Press, London, 2nd] Cammell Laird, the builder of the submarine "Thetis", announced that all the crew members of the submarine are safe.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The Admiralty has announced that the location of the "Thetis" submarine is still 14 miles from the sea. Four crew members have been rescued. The Admiralty had previously received information that the submarine had begun to move, but that was not true. The head of the submarine is now 130 feet underwater, and the tail is exposed above the water. The Admiralty also announced that the captain of the "Thetis" submarine and four other personnel have now been rescued. The four sailors were rescued by using the "Davis" escape apparatus, including Commander Wren of the Fifth Submarine Flotilla. The Admiralty said that high-explosive devices will soon be used at the tail of the submarine that floats to the surface to form a hole so that the submarine can float.

### American Residents of Paris Gather for Dinner; Ambassador Koo Speaks; China's Resistance to Aggression Today Is Enough to Defend the Freedom of All Countries

[Central News Agency, Paris, 1st] This American Club held a weekly dinner meeting this afternoon. Chinese Ambassador to France Koo Vi-kyuin, Ambassador Zong, Counselor Zheng Yiyi, Secretary Xie Dongfa, Canadian Minister Jean Désy, U.S. Ambassador, Counselor Hugh Robert Wilson, Chief Assistant Secretary of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Avant, were all in attendance. The club's chairman, Su Pu, first delivered a speech, expressing respect to the Chinese nation, saying that the Chinese nation's heroic resistance to Japan and defense of freedom is admired by the world. Ambassador Koo then spoke, recalling the origins of the Open Door Policy, saying that Japan is using all its strength to destroy this policy, intending to take all the benefits retained by foreigners and make China an economic and political hegemony. Since the Manchurian region was occupied by the Japanese army, foreign trade has been completely suspended, and the development of various raw materials has been monopolized by the Japanese. The Japanese are now promoting this method in North China and Central China, and controlling its postal service, telecommunications, seaports, railways, inland river navigation, power plants, and oil wells, using the control of all Chinese resources as a new aggression, in an attempt to control the whole world. It can be seen that the Far East incident is actually related to the nationalities of all countries. China's resistance to aggression is defending freedom, and countries with interests in the Far East are most dependent on it to defend their freedom.

### Hong Kong Government Strictly Prohibits Pig Farming in Kowloon Peninsula Three to Forty Thousand Farmers ×××× Ban Reaffirmed to be Implemented from the 17th of this Month Villagers from Various Rural Areas Send Representatives to Meet the Secretary for Chinese Affairs to Appeal for Maintenance

The Hong Kong Municipal Health Bureau recently announced the enforcement of a decision made in 1935 to ban villagers from raising pigs in various districts of the Kowloon Peninsula, ordering farmers to sell off all pigs, large and small, before the stipulated date, or face prosecution. After the announcement of this ban, the three to four thousand villagers in dozens of villages on the peninsula were alarmed. Once the authorities ban pig farming, it will affect their livelihood, as there is no hope for vegetable cultivation either. Representatives of various rural elders gathered several times to hold meetings and elected twelve representatives to appeal to the authorities.

Villagers from various rural areas signed to receive orders

The villagers and farming households raised over a thousand dollars to hire Barrister Luo Lianxun to negotiate with the authorities, pleading for consideration of the suffering of tens of thousands of people and withdrawing the order so that their livelihoods could be maintained. The representatives explained the difficulties encountered by farmers after the ban on pig farming, as well as the impact on the supply of food to Hong Kong residents and the various commercial reasons. Barrister Luo separately sent letters to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs and the Chinese representative of the Municipal Health Bureau to appeal. Barrister Luo informed the rural representatives to meet with the Secretary for Chinese Affairs yesterday afternoon, and then discussed with the relevant authorities whether the order could be withdrawn.

Related to Hygiene Determined to Strictly Prohibit

According to a senior health official, the authorities issued an ordinance several years ago to ban pig farming by farmers on the Kowloon Peninsula. The health authorities are now resolutely implementing it because they have carefully considered the importance of the matter. The pig farming practices of villagers on the peninsula do not conform to modern animal husbandry principles, and the places are unclean, leading to the proliferation of mosquitoes, which is detrimental to health. Residents in various districts of the Kowloon Peninsula have suffered from this. The significant increase in toxic mosquitoes in various districts of the peninsula in recent years is a clear indication, which not only exposes residents of the peninsula to mosquito bites but also directly and indirectly poses a significant threat to the health of the entire population. For the sake of protecting the health of all residents, the health authorities must announce the ban on pig farming by residents of the peninsula to eliminate the source of toxic mosquitoes and eradicate various infectious diseases caused by filth, so that the sanitary administration can be improved.

Tens of Thousands of Farmers ××××

However, these livestock farmers on the peninsula have been leasing barren land on Tai Mo Shan from the Hong Kong government at a small rent for grazing, vegetable cultivation, and chicken farming. Families depend on this for food and clothing. Although their livestock farming practices do not meet sanitary standards, if the authorities issue a ban, how will these farmers and their families survive? This is a matter that those who care about the people cannot ignore. Some believe that this can be used to promote a change in occupation, but the flames of war in Guangdong are still raging. Even if these people have homes in their villages, they may not be able to return. If the authorities are acting to protect the health of all people, they should find ways to make these pig farmers clean and improve, so that those who rely on livestock farming for their livelihood are not left with nothing to depend on. This is also for the sake of the city's appearance and public order. If these farmers lose this source of livelihood, they will inevitably end up in the lower classes, or those who cannot endure poverty will resort to desperate measures, which is not the original intention of the authorities to maintain the health of all people.

### The Sky Has Cleared and the Turf is Dry and Firm Over 90,000 Horse Racing Tickets Have Already Been Sold for Today's Special Race

### The Conservatory's Carnival is Scheduled to Open in the Middle of the Month The Carnival on the 17th at Ho Tung's Private Residence Will Feature Novel and Rich Entertainment

The second performance of the Carnival organized by the Hong Kong Branch of the China Wartime Children's Relief Association, which was originally scheduled to be held this afternoon at the private residence of Sir Ho Tung on the Peak, has been postponed to Saturday, the 17th of this month, from 2:00 PM to 7:00 PM, due to the horse racing season today, as it is feared that people from all walks of life will not be able to attend. It is understood that the various entertainment items in this carnival are more exciting and wonderful than the previous one. The most notable is the children's clothing show. It is heard that this show is very exquisite. The audience at the previous event was too crowded, so those who arrived later regretted not being able to see it.

At the same time, kindergarten students from the Children's Home of the Association will perform Western classical music and national salvation songs.

### The Haitian Wheel is Troubled in Fujian Most of the Passengers and Goods Were Forced to Return to Hong Kong × Warships in the Waters of Fujian Fired at Barges Carrying Passengers Arriving in Quanzhou, Passengers and Goods Were also Blocked British Warships Escorted Them Out of Fujian

The British vessel Haitian, which sails between Hong Kong and Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Shantou, departed from Hong Kong last month fully loaded with groceries and two cars, carrying over 300 passengers. It first arrived in Shantou, passed through Xiamen and Quanzhou, and went straight to Fuzhou, arriving on the 26th. It anchored at Chuanshi Mountain in the Fuzhou estuary. Because × warships were circling nearby, the goods for Fuzhou were prevented from being unloaded, resulting in a large number being transported back to Hong Kong. Except for a very small number who ventured to land, there were over 30 passengers who could not land and returned to Hong Kong on the original vessel. The vessel safely arrived at 9:20 AM yesterday. Apart from some bamboo mats and groceries for Shantou, there were no other goods. The sailing schedule was delayed by about a week. It is understood that this incident happened when × announced the blockade of our country's ports starting this month, which has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life. The reporter boarded the ship yesterday to investigate, and the information obtained is described below.

× Warships Gathered in Fujian to Strafe Barges Carrying Passengers

According to passengers, when the Haitian vessel arrived at the Fuzhou estuary on the 26th of last month, there were twelve × warships circling in the area, and ten × speedboats were patrolling the waters, monitoring the entry and exit of merchant ships from various countries. The situation was very tense. The vessel changed its anchorage to the sea off Chuanshi Mountain, which was more protruding. Barges coming and going, whether passenger boats or those transporting food supplies, were strafed by × speedboats with machine guns. Several passengers on the ship ventured to leave the ship and board barges to go ashore, resulting in being strafed by ×. The sound of gunfire was very dense at the time, and it is believed that there were many casualties.

× Warships Sent Aircraft to Bomb Fuzhou Madly

Because of this, other boats dared not approach the ship to transfer passengers. At the same time, unless there was a special permit issued by our Fuzhou Garrison Headquarters, no one was allowed to land. Therefore, most passengers were trapped on the ship. At that time, the ship originally planned to wait and see before sending the passengers ashore, but day after day, the harassment of the × speedboats continued. Later, two or thirty aircraft were sent out from the warships every day to bomb various parts of Fuzhou. During the four days that the vessel was anchored in Fuzhou, it saw × aircraft bombing Fuzhou five or six times. Judging from the situation, Fuzhou has now entered a state of war.

British Warships Escorted Five Vessels Simultaneously Out of Port

At 11:00 AM on the 13th of last month, the Haitian vessel, together with the Haicheng, Haimen, and a Jardine vessel, a total of five vessels, safely left Fuzhou under the protection of British warships. Most of the goods that the vessels were transporting to Fuzhou could not be unloaded. Only 1.5 million yuan in banknotes sent by the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation to its Fuzhou branch, and 1,292 boxes of wax, were able to be unloaded. Only a small number of passengers ventured to land, and over 30 passengers on the Haitian vessel returned to Hong Kong on the original vessel. Because the manager of a certain company was responsible for transporting them to Fuzhou, the loss was over 400 yuan. After leaving Fuzhou, the vessel sailed to Quanzhou, where it also saw a giant × warship, an aircraft carrier, and several speedboats in the Quanzhou estuary. Because the same situation occurred, no one dared to sail close. The passengers and all the goods on board could not be unloaded. At the same time, × aircraft constantly flew over Quanzhou and the mainland to bomb, so the vessel sailed back to Shantou, arriving one day later. No × warships were seen anchored in the waters of Shantou, and the city was still very peaceful. A small amount of goods were delivered to Hong Kong, and it arrived yesterday morning. It is scheduled to enter the shipyard for repairs during the day.

The Jardine Vessels Sail as Usual

According to a Jardine Shipping Company spokesperson, the Haitian vessel's daytime maintenance is normal and there are no other problems. It is an annual repair as usual. The Haicheng vessel is expected to arrive in Hong Kong from Shantou tomorrow morning, and the goods for Fuzhou will be returned on the original vessel. When asked whether the passengers on the vessel would return on the original vessel, the spokesperson replied that some would, and they would also be the cargo escorts. He also said that the company's vessels would continue to sail as usual in the future.

— Qi Zhuo

The Lee Gardens Sleeves Hall is a beautiful place to go; however, the guests attending all said in unison: "The road is not easy to walk." Take a break and rest comfortably for a while before starting the small group gathering.

This is the third film and drama symposium hosted by the Film and Drama Weekly of this newspaper, and we are very grateful to the drama pioneers and friends who came to participate.

In addition to all the members of the "China Relief" troupe, the guests included Ouyang Yuqian, Xia Yan, Tang Shuming, Zhang Xuefeng from the drama world, and Tang Huaiqiu representing Jin Jiabao, etc.; Luo Jingyu from the film world, and he also served as the representative of Cai Chusheng, etc., because Mr. Cai and others are busy filming! The painters included Zhang Zhengyu, Zhang Guangyu, and Ding Cong. The writer was Ma Guoliang. There were also many friends from the drama, cultural, and press circles. There were more than fifty people gathered together. The sensational "China Relief" performance in Hong Kong served as the center of everyone's conversation. Among the guests were friends from "China Relief", and each different face evoked memories of the stage. That mute, that old man... It was interesting to see the real faces, talking and laughing, the atmosphere was very harmonious.

Yesterday afternoon after 3:00 PM, Chairman Lu Fu first briefly explained the influence of "China Relief" on the new and national salvation drama movement over the past eleven years. From the strict and hard-working spirit of "China Relief"; to the thorough work goal of "China Relief" in promoting resistance against Japan and opening up a new foundation for emerging drama. He especially opened the way of working of China Relief in the past twenty months, and talked about how they used all possible methods to call on the public for more than 700 performances, how to penetrate into the vast classes of peasants and soldiers, and at the same time solemnly stated that they were in Hong Kong for the 742nd large-scale charity performance for the various sectors of the Relief Association, and the 743rd public performance for entertaining the public and students in Hong Kong, and the exquisite and magnificent great performances that were lived-out from the realities of life with the power of collective understanding and highly honed techniques had unprecedentedly expanded the field of dramatic effects and influence, and given a serious and fierce stimulus to the Hong Kong national salvation drama movement, hoping that all the advanced people present can give progressive discussions and encouragement to this performance, so that Hong Kong drama workers can accept their valuable experience and lessons, and finally, put forward the scope of discussion for this symposium, 1. the significance and influence of the "China Relief" performance in Hong Kong - the great significance of the performance, the impact on the general public, the reaction that drama workers in Hong Kong should have, 2. acting skills, stage technology, and so on, 3. the development of the national salvation drama movement - what is the foundation of the national salvation drama movement? the consciousness and form of the national salvation drama movement, the form and content of the national salvation drama movement, what efforts should dramatists make in the future...

Everyone enthusiastically welcomed Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, who was full of hope, who spoke first amid applause: "Serious, Disciplined, Passionate, Cordial" encompasses the entire picture of China Relief: the hard-working spirit and strict organization are very rare. The success of the performance goes without saying. The beauty of the sky curtain is the first time ever in Hong Kong. He earnestly hoped that young drama workers in Hong Kong would have a strict organization and let their passion and vitality develop well. Although the material conditions are difficult, they must also grow in difficult environments.

When Mr. Xia Yan spoke, everyone paid special attention. The performance of China Relief is clearly a rare opportunity. All criticisms are based on facts and are maintained and praised. Mr. Xia, however, gave a strict critique, loving deeply and hoping earnestly. The friends of China Relief were very grateful for the well-intentioned instructions, and everyone also felt the depth and strictness of Mr. Xia's speech.

Mr. Luo Jingyu first talked about the experience of co-producing a film with China Relief in Wuhan, and then said that when he watched "Defending the Country" this time, he also shed tears with the audience around him. He hoped that China Relief would make more efforts in the film aspect. This young owner of the China Film Studio also praised China Relief as "beautiful and simple," which is a very appropriate comment.

Mr. Zhang Xuefeng, the director of China Travel Agency, spoke vividly about stage design, with gestures and expressions that made people very interested. He was the only one who spoke Cantonese. The friends of China Relief took this opportunity to learn dialects, and they all stared intently with their mouths open. Especially the demeanor of Mr. Dai Ziying was particularly strong.

Mr. Ma Guoliang said that the most meaningful thing about China Relief's performance is that through drama, the theater has become a lively and intense public assembly. This is a good reality that Hong Kong has not had in the past two years of the Anti-Japanese War. - This is also the truth.

The artist Zhang Guangyu said that from the perspective of calligraphy and painting, the installations and lighting of the China Relief performances are very beautiful. Colleagues have also praised it in the same way. Mr. Ding Cong said that he had nothing to say, only a little bit, and this little bit was also a good supplement, which caused everyone to burst into laughter.

Mr. Huang Qinghua said that he had interviewed a worker audience. China Relief is deeply moving and the performance is successful.

Mr. Jinshan spoke, his "hoarse" voice had not yet recovered. He thanked this serious and sincere symposium. Wang Ying and Lin Shu expressed their gratitude to the friends who helped in all aspects.

Mr. Ouyang was the first to speak, and Mr. Ouyang was the last to speak. He solemnly said that it is already commendable that China Relief can do this. "We must all learn from each other, not be afraid of making mistakes, as long as we admit mistakes, correct them, and seek progress," this is a moving motto.

May everyone remember that Mr. Ouyang is so humble and learn from Mr. Ouyang's thirst for knowledge

After the chairman gave a speech of thanks, everyone ate "beautiful and simple" refreshments, took a group photo, and wished everyone eternal love, mutual learning, and standing together to welcome the great era.

The radio can receive all radio stations in the Far East. The real price is 49 yuan and 50 cents per set, which is indeed an unprecedented record of low price and exquisite radio in Hong Kong.

### [Mourning] In Hong Kong (Continued)

— Yu Lang

Carrying paper money to "buy water" for the deceased to wash their face; at the death of parents, the son must write a memorial with the words "Gratitude for Labor Unrepaid" or "The Limitless Sky"; returning the soul... all of these are not in the ancient rituals. They are vulgar people's forced associations and presumptuous acts.

Speaking of this, I can turn the pen and talk about the mourning itself -

Whenever someone dies at home, a practicing Western doctor must sign a certificate and register it with the Births and Deaths Registry of the Health Bureau to obtain a registration certificate before burial.

The cemeteries for burial are all designated. Residents west of Taiyuan Street in Wan Chai, including Central, Sheung Wan, and Sai Ying Pun, must be buried in the Jilonghuan Public Cemetery. Residents east of Taiyuan Street, including Wan Chai, Causeway Bay, and Shau Kei Wan, must be buried in the Coffee Garden or Chai Wan Cemetery. On the Kowloon side, there is the Kowloon Public Cemetery.

These cemeteries are built level by level, digging graves around the hillside, with each grave less than three feet apart, looking like the seats in a theater from a distance. Living in Hong Kong is crowded and land-scarce; dying in Hong Kong is also crowded!

The mountain land is divided into several types: five dimes, one yuan, three yuan, and five yuan. The burial is based on the lot number. There is no choice. In this environment, the concept of feng shui is completely dispelled.

The graves in these cemeteries do not have any mounds, let alone a Luo acupoint, "Green Dragon" or "White Tiger"; the rich use cement to make a rectangular platform for worship, with a monument erected on it, half-Chinese and half-Western, which is considered a tomb. The poor only erect a short stele about a foot high on the ground, with a lot number stone erected behind it, and the weeds grow wildly. Often it is submerged and cannot be found.

In addition to public cemeteries, the rich can be buried in the "Eternal Cemetery" in Aberdeen. The mountain land in this cemetery is wider, the construction is better, and the cost of each lot is more than 30 yuan. It is "eternal" unlike public cemeteries that require the exhumation of bones and relocation seven years after burial.

Various religions have their own cemeteries dedicated to burying their members.

Those who die in hospitals hold funerals in the open space next to the mortuary. The hospital does not have a well-built place for people to hold funerals. What is most unsatisfactory is that the servants take the opportunity to ask for money; for example, if the family hires a Nammo to chant scriptures, they have to burn paper money for them... There are too many to list.

As for the main item of mourning - the coffin; the price is not fixed. A thin coffin costs ten or eight dollars, a medium one costs fifty or sixty dollars, and expensive wood materials such as Tingzhou wood and agarwood cost one or two thousand dollars, which is more expensive than a new 1939 car—

Western-style coffins have become very popular in recent years, and the price is not necessarily cheap. The most ordinary one costs more than a hundred yuan, and a fancy coffin costs two or three thousand yuan, which is not something that ordinary people can afford.

No matter how noble or humble, they are all withered bones. Death is originally the most equal thing, but the rituals of death are not equal. The saying "Wealthy at thirty is respected, poor at eighty is a young death" is aimed at satirizing the rituals of mourning.

### Guerrilla Squad in Xiaogang Road, Henan, Guangzhou Annihilates Dozens of Japanese Troops; Disguised as Farmers and Peddlers, They Attack Unprepared

(Guangzhou Express News) Our guerrilla squads active in the suburbs of Guangzhou have repeatedly attacked Japanese troops. On the 28th, several dozen guerrillas from a certain unit gathered in a certain place near Nancun in Henan to hold a small group discussion meeting to discuss future strategies for annihilating the Japanese and to prepare to mobilize the local defense team in the southern district. That evening, it was reported that a small squad of Japanese troops, about a hundred or so men, had entered Guangzhou from Le Village. Our guerrilla squad immediately disguised themselves as peddlers and farmers, dispersing into smaller groups, and headed to Xiaogang Road. At 6 PM, the Japanese troops indeed passed through Xiaogang Road. Five of our guerrillas, carrying bamboo baskets on their shoulders, were the first to encounter the Japanese. Unexpectedly, the Japanese were cunning and, upon seeing them, immediately shouted for a search. Disregarding everything, our five brave men immediately pulled out their guns and opened fire on the Japanese, killing two Japanese soldiers on the spot. The other dispersed guerrillas, hearing the gunshots, also emerged from the fields and hills, surrounding the Japanese from all sides. The Japanese troops were caught by surprise and panicked. They resisted with their weapons, and the fighting lasted for about forty minutes, killing or wounding twenty or thirty Japanese soldiers.

(Dongguan Special News) Liu Faquan, the commander of the Third Brigade of the Fourth-First District Column of the Guangdong Guerrilla Force, has been extremely active in carrying out anti-Japanese work since he was ordered to organize and establish the brigade headquarters. Recently, because Zhu Liu, the pseudo-chairman of the Maintenance Committee in Zhongtang, Dongguan County, colluded with the Japanese troops, acted as a henchman, and oppressed the people, his evil deeds were obvious. In order to kill one to warn a hundred and eliminate traitors, a commando team in plain clothes was dispatched the day before yesterday to sneak into Zhongtang and assassinate the traitor when the opportunity arose. Zhu Liu, the pseudo-chairman of the Maintenance Committee, and several Japanese soldiers were shot dead, and various documents attached to the Japanese were found on his body. The traitors were eliminated, and everyone who heard about it was overjoyed. The Japanese troops and traitors stationed in the Zhongtang area are extremely terrified and live in constant fear. In addition, a few days ago, more than ten Japanese troops in Humen took an electric boat to harass the Shexi sea area of Dongguan. Liu Faquan learned about this and immediately sent dozens of troops to attack them. When the Japanese boat docked and landed, they were immediately swept by light machine guns, and twelve Japanese soldiers, including Qi Gongzhi Gong and Zhigong, were killed. The remaining Japanese soldiers fled back to the boat. Documents and photos were found on the bodies of the Japanese soldiers.

### Our Troops on the South Bank of the East River Prepare to Counterattack the Japanese Again; Japanese Troops in Guanlongtai and Others Conscript Our People into Military Service; Our Troops on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Advance to Guanlong Station

(Shenzhen Express News) The Japanese troops on the south bank of the East River have recently built a large number of defensive fortifications in the strongholds of Guanlongtai and others, actively forcing our people into military service in the hope of solidifying their defenses. However, our troops are still advancing according to a consistent strategy, striving to ensure that the Japanese troops have no chance to breathe. There have been good gains in recent days. Our recent intelligence on the Japanese is as follows:

Japanese Troops Massively Conscript Our People

According to intelligence, Japanese commanders Yukawa, Iijima, Taihei, Narahara, and others, stationed in Shilong, Guancheng, Taiping, and other places, convened a meeting at the Japanese Military Headquarters in Guancheng on the 30th of last month, attended by pseudo-county magistrate Zhang Guoxun, pseudo-administrative commissioner Li Guoren, and various puppet traitors, specifically to discuss methods of recruiting our people. It was decided to conscript our people in the name of forming an "advance team," with five to ten people from each village. The methods used were both enticement and coercion, with the pseudo-district and township chiefs responsible for the conscription. After training at the Japanese Military Headquarters, they would be sent to the front lines for combat. The people, after hearing the news, were greatly alarmed and tried to escape by all means.

Our Troops Prepare for Another Counterattack

Our current combat strategy does not focus on capturing points, but purely adopts a mobile approach, aiming to harass the Japanese troops and then annihilate them in a large-scale operation. The two attacks last month were implementations of this strategy. It has been received by phone from the front that our troops on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, Zhanglu Road, and Baotai Road lines received orders again yesterday to counterattack as the opportunity arises. On the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, our troops charged into Guanlong Station on the 31st, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese and destroying two Japanese artillery positions. The troops on the south bank of the East River are in high spirits and have great confidence in annihilating the Japanese.

### Jilian Ferry Robbed Three Times; Losses Total 3,000 Yuan; Now Suspended

(Nanhai Communication) The Jilian ferry going to Foshan from the province set off at 7 o'clock on the morning of the 31st, fully furnished with Japanese flags, from the province, and at about eight o'clock, when it sailed to the Dahui River surface of Nanhai County, it was suddenly intercepted by four speedboats from both sides. After searching everything, they released it. It was found that the ferry had been robbed twice before, and this was the third time. The total loss of passengers, goods, and fares amounted to 3,000 yuan. Afterwards, two Japanese speedboats drove to chase and search, but nothing was found.

### North Route Reinforcements Again, Vowing to Invade Juntian; Large Amounts of Poison Gas Delivered, Intending to Use Massacre Tactics

(Beijiang Express News) The Japanese troops on the North Route are being suppressed by our forces and have repeatedly attempted to break through, but due to our strong strength and solid line of defense, they have been defeated again and again and are feeling increasingly anxious. They are now sending large reinforcements, intending to make a final stand.

Reinforcing Northern Guangdong, Still Intending to Make a Stand

According to military intelligence, the Japanese troops on the North Route are trying to break the deadlock by sending reinforcements again. The right wing, Taipingchang Shangang, has been reinforced by more than 300 troops from the Katano unit. The front, the Hengtanjiang Village on the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway, has also been reinforced by 400 to 500 troops, including about 200 cavalry, stationed in Longxiang, Tanzibeijiao, and the hills. They have been riding back and forth on the positions in recent days, showing signs of restlessness.

Large Amounts of Poison Gas Delivered to the Front Lines

In addition to sending large reinforcements to various points, the Japanese troops have also delivered large amounts of poison gas, preparing to use inhumane means to massacre our troops. It is reported that more than a dozen truckloads of poison gas were transported from Guangzhou on the 26th and 27th, mostly mustard gas, tear gas, and dumdum bullets. It was found that when the Japanese troops invaded Longkou on the 29th and were intercepted by our Peng Division, they suddenly used tear gas. More than a dozen of our soldiers were caught off guard and fainted on the spot. Fortunately, most were equipped with gas masks, which prevented them from being poisoned.

The Japanese Again Vow to Invade Juntian

The Japanese troops are accustomed to making alarming threats and have recently released all sorts of absurd rumors, vowing to invade Juntian. In recent days, they have sent aircraft to Guotai, Baini, Lianglong Market, and other places to distribute leaflets in an attempt to intimidate us. It is reported that the Zhao, Peng, and Li divisions of our defense forces have increased their forces and opened up Japanese ×××× belt, strengthening the defense and guarding against it.

### Special Local Products Subject to Transit Tax are Allowed to be Repackaged and Reorganized to Offset Taxes; Beihai Increases Tax on Goods Transported by Ships by Three Per Thousand

(Beihai Express News) Beihai Customs issued a notice yesterday, stating that special local products subject to transit tax, if they are prepared to be re-exported to foreign countries, may be specially allowed to be repackaged, reorganized, or re-bundled, and still enjoy the benefits of re-exporting to offset taxes, but must meet the following conditions: (1) Apply for permission from the Customs; (2) The repackaging and other matters must be supervised by the Customs; (3) The form of the goods after repackaging should be detailed in the declaration form and approved by the Customs.

Since there was no source of funds, the Hepu County Government had planned to levy an import and export tax on all sailboats and ships at a rate of 3 per thousand of the estimated value. However, the Beihai merchants believed that most of the goods transported by sailboats were for transshipment and still needed to be transferred to ships for export, which seemed to be a duplicate tax, so they expressed their disagreement. The county government has slightly revised the measures and tentatively plans to collect import and export taxes on ships only, with the tax rate still set at 3 per thousand of the customs estimate.

### Large Quantities of × Goods; Attempt to Promote Sales in Southern Guangdong; Inducing Criminals to Smuggle Imports; Authorities Have Ordered Strict Prevention by All Counties

(Southern Guangdong Express) × is scheming to intensify its economic aggression against us, in coordination with its military operations. Within our occupied territories, it is actively selling × goods. In non-occupied areas, it instigates Chinese collaborators to find ways to smuggle them in. It has been discovered that three × merchant ships are currently docked in Haikou, Hainan, carrying large quantities of × goods for sale at high prices in Haikou, to extract money from our people. However, the people's property has long been plundered, and their purchasing power is extremely weak, making it impossible to sell the × goods. Recently, they have resorted to a trick, exploiting the fact that Xuwen is separated from Hainan Island by only a narrow strip of water and the distance is not far. They are inducing Chinese traitors and criminals to smuggle × goods into our interior, promoting sales in various counties of Southern Guangdong. This scheme has already been detected by our authorities, who have issued orders to all coastal counties to strictly inspect import and export trade. If any traitors are found smuggling enemy goods, they will be arrested and prosecuted without leniency.

Film and Drama

### Stalin and Chaplin

— German Web

The works of the master of screen humor, Charlie Chaplin, have not been seen for a long time. Recently, Chaplin personally took action because many ambitious countries were arbitrarily bullying the weak and disregarding justice and reason. He starred in the film *The Dictator*. The film depicts a vagrant who is imprisoned in a German concentration camp. Later, because the vagrant looks very much like the current German leader Hitler, some nervous friends mistakenly believe he is Hitler and ask him to come out safely. Afterwards, he makes the most of the mistake and creates many hilarious jokes.

Since the news of Chaplin's production of *The Dictator* reached the Soviet Union, the Central Film Committee of the Soviet Union has decided to award Chaplin the Red Banner of Labor Order to show their encouragement. At the same time, the Soviet Union's supreme leader Stalin also issued an order to the whole country, ordering all theaters to unanimously show Chaplin's films for a week, starting on Chaplin's 50th birthday on the 16th of last month, to commemorate him. Because Chaplin is not just an entertainer from Hollywood, he is a powerful figure who uses film to resist capitalism and the bourgeoisie. His broken boots, gourd belly, and old cane are truly the best magic weapons for consolidating democratic politics by striking at totalitarian politics. Therefore, all people in countries that love freedom and peace should pay him the highest respect.

### Garbo to Star in Comedy; Ernst Lubitsch to Direct

Greta Garbo has been on the screen for more than ten years, and most of her films have been mysterious tragedies. But her next film is a romantic comedy. On the one hand, it is to give the audience a change of pace. On the other hand, it may also be to develop another aspect of the actress's talent. The film is called "Ninotchka." Garbo plays a Russian woman named Ninotchka. The theme is very novel. The male lead may be William Powell. The director is Ernst Lubitsch, who is very confident in Garbo's comedic talent.

### Simone Simon in London

Opens Paris Theater

French films have made great progress in recent years. Although they cannot compare with American films in the international market, they are gradually becoming more popular and fashionable everywhere. English-speaking countries, such as England and America, have long been markets for French films. In London, there are three theaters that specialize in showing French films, and business is booming. In April of this year, a new theater specializing in French films opened in London. The theater is called the "Paris Theater." The architecture is very magnificent and is second to none among London cinemas.

The film that opened that day was the famous French film "La bête humaine." Film critics in London newspapers unanimously praised it as a rare masterpiece.

At the curtain call, the famous French film stars Simone Simon and Jean Gabin appeared. The audience applauded enthusiastically. When they left the theater, Simone Simon and Jean Gabin were surrounded by more than a thousand fans and could not escape. In the end, a group of police officers used force to rescue them.

In the evening, the manager of the Paris Theater held a party at a famous nightclub in London. Simone Simon was so happy that she danced non-stop and refused to leave until one o'clock in the morning.

The viewing ceremony lasted for 19 minutes. Dr. Dafoe, who has been in charge of the five sisters since they were born, called out their names one by one, and they met the King and Queen. Each of the five girls, upon hearing their name, very respectfully and carefully walked to the King and Queen and saluted.

After this simple ceremony, the five sisters were entertained by the King and Queen and were allowed to move around the room as they pleased. Cecile was the first to cross the reception room and kiss the Queen. Then her sisters, seeing Cecile doing this, surrounded the Queen and competed to be the first to kiss the Queen. The Queen was very happy to see the enthusiasm of these five little girls and held them in her arms one by one, kissing them in turn.

At that time, King George, in this situation, was so surrounded by the girls that he forgot everything. It was not until Yvonne untangled the situation that he woke up. She walked up to the King, took his hand, and stroked it. The King leaned over as if to say something softly in her ear, and they all laughed.

Marie, seeing her sister playing with the man in the sailor suit for too long, walked over and gave a bouquet of flowers to the King. As for the other four sisters, they all gave their bouquets of flowers to the Queen.

### Thoroughly Eradicate Opium Addiction; Conduct Registration of Addicts; Establish Factories to Accommodate Released Addicts Undergoing Treatment

(Shaoguan Express) Provincial Chairman Li Hanhun believes that since the opium addiction treatment hospitals in various counties and cities have been accommodating addicts for treatment, many addicts have been successfully cured and discharged from the hospital. However, after the addicts are discharged, due to their poor environment, many have relapsed. This situation makes it difficult to completely eradicate opium addiction. In order to thoroughly eradicate it and provide addicts with proper jobs to maintain their livelihoods after they are discharged, it is planned that the provincial government will allocate funds to establish a Qiangmin Factory to accommodate addicts who have been discharged from the opium addiction treatment hospitals in various counties and cities to work in the factory. Chairman Li has ordered the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Finance, the Department of Construction, and other agencies to handle this matter jointly. The three agencies have now sent staff to jointly plan and prepare the budget for the project. After submitting it to the provincial government for review, it can be implemented step by step. It is said that the scale of the Qiangmin Factory is quite large. All wartime industries and military production are planned to be carried out in the future. In addition, He Tong, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, in order to actively promote the anti-opium policy and eradicate opium addiction, believes that many unregistered addicts have been overlooked in various counties and should be registered to accommodate as many addicts as possible for treatment in the hospital. It is specifically decided that the registration of overlooked addicts will be carried out from the 1st to the 30th of this month, and the registration method has been drafted and promulgated to various counties to be carried out on schedule. Yesterday, Chen Zhiming and others were dispatched to various counties to be responsible for supervising the addicts' registration and inspecting the anti-opium policies in various counties.

### Public Baseball League: Hong Kong Club to Play Friends Beer; Both Sides Have Strong Strength and a Fierce Battle Is Expected

(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) In the past two or three weeks, it has rained almost every day, and good sports fields have been repeatedly affected. Taking the public baseball league as an example, there have been as many as six games postponed due to rain, which is very disappointing for the fans.

If it is sunny today, there will be a baseball game at the Royal Naval Ground on Caroline Hill at 2:30 pm, with the Hong Kong Club playing the Friends Beer team.

Friends Beer initially won against the Western Club and then defeated the Mindanao team, and then became known as a strong team. The team was originally a transformed version of the unremarkable Volunteer Army from last year. However, due to diligent practice recently, the skills of each player have greatly improved, so they have won two games in a row and become a powerful contender for the championship in the future.

The Hong Kong Club has many good players joining, and the lineup has been renewed. Judging from the team's fierce battle against the Chinese team last month, although they were defeated, they posed a great threat to the Chinese team. In the fifth inning, they even took a 6-4 lead. However, they were unable to sustain their strength and collapsed, allowing the Chinese team to seize the final victory. However, the team is still a strong force, and its strong fighting power is enough to compete with any team.

Today, when Friends Beer plays against the Hong Kong Club, most people will predict that Friends Beer will win, but I dare not make a judgment in advance, because Friends Beer has a half a catty, and the Hong Kong Club also has eight taels. Moreover, the Hong Kong Club players' batting skills are no worse than those of the opponent, but their defensive coordination seems to be less meticulous than that of the opponent.

If the Hong Kong Club players pay attention to the defensive aspects and reduce mistakes, it will make the opponent feel uneasy to reach the base.

The pitcher is the soul of a team. If a pitcher has good skills, the team has a higher hope of winning. Friends Beer pitcher Xia Gaoli has very good skills, but he cannot last a long time. After the fourth or fifth inning, his pitching power feels weakened. Hong Kong Club pitcher Luo Lanshi also has this shortcoming, but his technique does not seem to be as unique as Xia Gaoli's. Therefore, Friends Beer is more likely to win.

However, the key to victory in baseball is not just one pitcher. The most important thing is the cooperation of the whole team. If their cooperation is effective and their communication is consistent, they are not far from victory.

The Hong Kong Club's communication does not seem to be as good as that of Friends Beer, but when competing, it is difficult for anyone to guarantee that there will be no mistakes. If Friends Beer is a little careless and gives people a chance, it is not surprising that there will be unexpected results. In short, this game is worth watching. The player lists for both sides are as follows: (

### A Scene of Bloody Battle: Heavyweight Boxing Match; Rowan Wins Over Bell; A Fierce Battle of Eleven Rounds Before the Winner Was Determined; Bell Becomes a Bloody Man

[Reuters News Agency, New York, 2nd] A heavyweight boxing match of fifteen rounds was held here last night. Young talent Rowan knocked down Bell in the eleventh round. Bell weighed two hundred and ten and a quarter pounds, and Luo weighed two hundred and two pounds.

The atmosphere was extremely cold during the competition, and there were 25,000 spectators. Famous boxers Dempsey, Tanglai, and Joe Louis were all present to watch.

Before the competition, it was estimated that Rowan had an eleven to ten chance of winning.

After the start of the game, Rowan immediately used both fists to win the first round. Bell committed an illegal act, and the referee issued a warning to him, but Rowan was not affected.

In the second round, the two sides fought fiercely against each other. Bell's movements were very barbaric, and he repeatedly scolded Rowan. Bell won this round.

The third round ended in a draw. In the fourth round, Bell made another wrong punch. The two sides held their fists together for readjustment. Bell won this round.

In the fifth round, both men showed fatigue. Blood dripped from Bell's mouth, but he still tried his best to win. In the fifth and sixth rounds, Rowan appeared to be in a difficult situation, but in the seventh round, he recovered and made many good punches, winning both the seventh and eighth rounds. Bell's mouth and eyes were injured, blood was gushing from his mouth, and his eyes were closed. Rowan took the upper hand and hit his opponent with many heavy punches.

In the tenth round, Bell's mouth was even more injured and it was difficult for him to resist Rowan's fierce attack. At the beginning of the eleventh round, the referee asked Bell if he could continue fighting. Bell said he could. The two sides fought again, for about one minute and twenty-one seconds. The referee then announced the end of the battle, and Bell, covered in blood, was unable to continue fighting.

### The Responsibility of Football Players

Furthermore, there must be the authority to command the entire team. If a certain player's position is inappropriate, or if a pass or kick is illegal, corrections can be made at any time. When a forward enters the opposing team's penalty area, the center back should follow and wait outside the enemy's forward line. If the ball is returned by the enemy, it can be sent back into the penalty area at any time. If the defensive strength of an area is weak, one should rush to the open space to fill the gap, or have one of the two midfielders replace them to defend. The two midfielders are like the two arms of the center back. Ideally, they should act according to the center back's intentions, going left when desired, going right when desired, fully assisting left and right. When the team's forwards are attacking, one should always leave a player to connect with the two fullbacks to solidify the defense. The position of this remaining midfielder is behind the center back and in front of the two fullbacks, forming a triangle. Even if the forward attack is unsuccessful and the ball is intercepted by the opponent, the three fullbacks will not be in any danger.

Regarding the three-fullback formation, which is commonly used in modern England, the responsibility of the two midfielders is to monitor the enemy's two wings and two inside forwards, cutting off their connection. If the opponent's two wings have excellent individual skills, the two midfielders can devote all their efforts to dealing with them. The positions of midfielders and fullbacks are different, and their work also differs accordingly. When a fullback gets the ball, they often don't have time to consider and simply kick the ball out, which is considered fulfilling their responsibility. However, it is not the same for a midfielder to get the ball. When someone is blocking, they must quickly pass the ball to a teammate. If no one is intercepting, they must dribble the ball forward calmly. Only when an enemy approaches should they pass to a teammate in the best position. After the opponent or the team kicks the ball out of bounds, the midfielder is responsible for throwing the ball and fighting for possession. When the forwards' attack is unsuccessful and the ball is intercepted by the opponent, it is a kind of feeling for the midfielders of this side. If the pass is accurate and quick as lightning, the second attack will surely succeed. However, the passing midfielder, who bears the great responsibility for victory or defeat, should first examine which of the team's forwards is in the most advantageous position and then pass to that player. Avoid the common habit of the left midfielder only passing the ball to the left winger and the right midfielder only passing to the right inside forward and right winger, thus losing the opportunity.

### ### The Nation and Economic Undertakings

— Zhang Dechang

At that time, governments of various countries used loans and subsidies to support small farmers and develop cooperative undertakings to prevent small farmers from being exploited by middlemen. Germany and Russia even carried out large-scale political reforms of the land situation. They used low-cost railway transportation policies to facilitate the distribution of agricultural products and tariff policies to protect rural areas. Even the United States, a country rich in agricultural products, also adopted political methods to resist the intrusion of Canadian agricultural products. In terms of industry, the government stipulated various laws to restrict industrial mergers, protect industrial workers, train unskilled workers, and improve production capacity. The state not only passively managed but also gradually established government-run industries. Initially, these included military factories and other industries related to war. Railway machinery factories in countries with state-owned railways were naturally state-run. Some industries were managed by the state, but also used subsidies to encourage private capital to create them. The state could manage them. For example, Russia's steel industry was created under the favorable conditions of heavy government subsidies. Germany's shipbuilding industry was also successfully assisted by the government through political means. As for transportation undertakings, the relationship with the state was even more direct. In countries where railways were privately owned, governments such as those of Britain and France gradually gained regulatory power. Apart from capital organization, technology occupies an important position in all economic undertakings. If one only focuses on private individuals to research and individual factories and stores to train workers, the scope of impact will be very small. Since the 19th century, countries have played a significant role in this regard. Research institutions and educational institutions were mostly established or facilitated by the government. We can say that without the various actions of political intervention in economic undertakings since the 19th century, modern economic undertakings would not have the development they have today. Therefore, the relationship between the nation and economic undertakings has been the closest since the 19th century. The power of political intervention in economic undertakings has increased and its scope has expanded, which is the first foundation for the emergence of modern controlled economies and planned economies.

The European War, which lasted for four years, further advanced state management of economic undertakings and opened up a new situation. During the European War, both sides of the belligerent countries strictly controlled economic undertakings, and there is no need to elaborate on the details. We will simply explain two points. First, during these four years of war, the government's power to control economic undertakings expanded to the maximum extent. A report from the British wartime cabinet stated: "The vast majority of people serve the public directly or indirectly. In addition to soldiers and officials, some are engaged in agriculture, some in manufacturing, and others are devoted to organizing, transferring, and distributing undertakings. All production institutions have been taken over by the government from private hands, including railways, shipping, coal, iron, engineering manufacturing, and raw materials, food, and charcoal, etc. The government must not only be responsible for raising enough but also be responsible for managing them so that both individuals and the state benefit. The government must also manage prices, suppress excessive profits, control spending, set maximum prices, and manage import and export trade. In short, all consumption, production, and related undertakings have been subjected to government control for the first time. Because of this war, the state's social and administrative organization has undergone a major change. Many of these changes cannot be altered in the future." Since the government manages various economic undertakings, the pre-war government organization was not sufficient to cope with this major responsibility. Therefore, the second point we must pay attention to is the expansion of the organization along with the expansion of government functions. The British government hired more than 230,000 people, large and small, during the war. The situation was the same in various belligerent countries. The government became the largest employer for the first time. Although these four years of measures were wartime situations, they left a deep impression on people's minds. The state's control of economic undertakings has had several years of practical experience, achieving the most effective and reasonable results. This shows that economic undertakings should be planned under the unified planning of a national government, which is the second foundation for modern controlled economies and planned economies.

Modern controlled economies and planned economies take this foundation as a precedent in order to build a new economic system to replace the private economic system. We do not need to mention their theories here. However, there are two points we want to bring up: first, there is an overall plan under one government; second, the government's organization is changed and expanded to implement this plan. The current government's organization cannot handle the heavy responsibilities.

The management of economic undertakings with political power has now become an established trend. However, the nature of the problem is different for a country with an existing industrial base and a country that is not industrialized. For the former, the most important issue is how to transfer private production undertakings to the state. In these countries, industrialists, merchants, and landlords have deep-rooted forces. The social resistance is very large. However, even in these countries, the goal of state-owned enterprises can be achieved through peaceful means. For an industrially backward country, the problem is much simpler. For example, China does not have large industrial and commercial forces. The only cumbersome problem is the land problem. In other aspects, no private economic force is greater than the government. The government is the largest capitalist and the largest employer. At the same time, only the government is the largest organization for recruiting technical personnel and training technical institutions. It is much easier and more convenient to develop economic undertakings with political power. Whether in wartime or after the war, China's industrial problems must be determined by the solution of capital and technology problems. Speaking of capital and technology, besides the government, what private force can be compared with it?

Chinese Representative to the Olympic Conference

### Dr. Wang Zhengting Arrives in London, Will Stay in England for Ten Days Before Returning Home

[Reuters, London, 200 words] Dr. Wang Zhengting arrived in Croyden by plane from China yesterday, representing China at the Olympic Committee meeting. The meeting is scheduled to hold its first meeting on June 6. Mr. Wang told a Reuters reporter, "Improving sports is my main purpose at present. Sports have given great benefits to the youth of the new China. I sincerely hope that sports and stadiums will be as important in China as they are in Britain in the future." When asked if he had completely left his diplomatic career, Mr. Wang replied excitedly, "This is what I want!" Mr. Wang will stay in England for ten days before returning home, but he may also travel to the United States, which is uncertain.

### Miscellaneous Writings from Western Hunan

— Cao Ming

(II) Women and Baskets

The women of western Hunan are more special than women in other parts of China. Ninety percent of them are working women. Whether in work or at home, they bear twice as much work as men. Taking Yuanling as an example, this is even more evident. In Yuanling, about one-fifth or more of the men smoke opium. They don't care about anything and sit at home all day. All household affairs and production are supported by women. Only when they are in a bad mood or feel that the material supply is not enough do they scold their wives or daughters. Besides that, the only thing they do is go to tea houses to chat.

The women, from the age of seven or eight, are trained in the skill of climbing mountains. On their shoulders, they carry a "wastepaper basket"-like basket, step by step, up and down. They are trained like this until they are old and can no longer carry heavy loads, and only then do they break away from the basket.

The basket has many uses. It is usually used to carry firewood, rice, and even heavier boxes and packages. They often transport goods for shops and carry luggage for guests. Thirty or forty pounds of things in the basket are very easy for them. In addition, the basket has a major use, which is to put children who cannot walk yet in the basket and take them up the mountains and down to the fields. During hard work, the child's swaying little hands and sweet and tender voice can give the mother infinite comfort.

The women's physique is mostly strong and robust, and their skin is rough and slightly yellowish-brown. Yes, in addition to being battered by the sun and rain every day, they also suffer from the ravages of childbirth and the various abuses given by their husbands and families.

When every outsider first arrives in Yuanling, they will think, "Since women can produce everyone, their status in the family must be very high." But the facts tell us that this is not the case. After a girl is born, she grows slowly in neglect and contempt. When she is able to walk steadily and climb high, the basket begins to form a deep relationship with her. The basket seems to be their destiny—their inescapable and painful destiny. Later, according to their age and family circumstances, the increase or decrease of labor is determined. After growing up, like the women oppressed by the feudal forces everywhere, they are married off by their parents in a semi-sale-like manner. After that, they bear heavier labor and suffer more complex mental pain.

The average number of women in western Hunan who have the opportunity to be educated is less than one or two out of a hundred, so it can be said that they are completely uneducated. The first reason, of course, is that the people of western Hunan are generally poor and it is not easy to provide for their children to go to school. The second reason is that they despise girls and are deeply poisoned by the idea that "lack of talent is a virtue for women." The opportunity for women to seek knowledge is completely deprived.

They cannot let women have knowledge, cannot let them know this society, and cannot let them know humanity. If they understand everything, how can they endure the shackles of the feudal forces? ... Under this clever method of rule, Chinese women have sacrificed infinite life and energy. The working women of western Hunan are continuing to sacrifice under heavier persecution. This is a painful thing!

Workers in the women's liberation movement and workers mobilizing the masses should pay close attention to this issue and properly guide the strength of Chinese women into the overall strength of the war of resistance.

... Liberate the painful destiny of the women of western Hunan and unload the unreasonable burden on their backs. Their strong bodies still have to carry heavy loads, but what they carry is not the cruel pressure of feudalism, but the common destiny of every person in the Chinese nation in the war of resistance!

(III) An Example

Since western Hunan is so important in terms of national defense, but the people's lives are so difficult and the culture is so backward, these are all very serious problems in the overall war of resistance. If we want to promote victory in the war of resistance, then how to improve people's lives and how to promote mass mobilization work has become the most urgent need. The old couple in the Chenxi Land Temple, I think this is the best example for our reflection...

Outside the west gate, turning from the main street into Mafangjie and running all the way up the mountain, halfway up the mountain, you can see a Land Temple hidden by the roadside. It is so old and gray, with ash and dirt piled up on both sides. No one burns incense, and there are no inscriptions. It is a humble and dirty place that has been completely forgotten.

The only ones who have developed a friendship with that small ancient temple and cannot leave it for a day are an old beggar couple over seventy years old. They have lived there for more than ten years, it is said. In front of the Land Temple, which is four feet wide, the old beggars each occupy a space, so passers-by especially feel that this place is narrow ... Moreover, in the spring, the old people's space exudes a musty smell, and in the winter, they burn garbage and grass that they pick up everywhere, and the five surrounding military camps can smell the burnt smell.

Because I have to pass by that Land Temple every day for office work, the two abandoned old people are always lying on their indescribably filthy space, moaning like pigeons. Their faces are like ancient pottery just excavated from the ground, and their gray hair and facial features are almost mixed together.

"Are you local people?" One day, I asked the man.

The old man stared at me for a while before nodding.

"Is she your woman?" I squatted down and pointed at the old woman. She was facing the wall, moaning and sobbing in the cold.

"No," the old man replied.

But when I pressed him, he slyly said:

"In short, she is my woman, that's it. I forgot who she is to me." He turned his head to ask the old woman, "Hey, are you eight years younger than me?"

The old woman impatiently kept her face against the wall and said:

"Uh, I have eight fewer cold days than you, that's it. I don't know what a year is!"

The old man didn't speak and lowered his head to play with the burnt fuel. I was afraid that the old woman would get angry and didn't dare to talk to her, so I quietly asked the old man:

"Hey! Has the enemy's plane been to Yuanling? "He didn't answer me, so I continued to ask him:

"Do you hate the Japanese? They have driven millions of us out of our homes!"

What kind of × person's plane? What Japanese? Sir, where are you from? - Why are you asking me these things? I don't know anything. It's just that many outsiders have come to Yuanling in the past six months, and when the whistle blows, they rush to the top of the mountain. The world is a bit dreamy. There weren't so many people before. Is there some kind of disaster outside? Are the robbers driving people here?" (To be continued)

### Random Thoughts on Writing Practice

— Lan Hong

The reason why works since the War of Resistance are "all the same," according to theorists, is due to the author's lack of deep engagement with life. I think this statement is correct, but on the other hand, readers also find the works to be technically immature. Unstable living conditions and the shortness of writing time can naturally be a reason, but we should not be satisfied with this reason unless we do not want to improve.

The same subject matter can produce works of different styles. This is the characteristic of literature as a form of storytelling. Writing is not formulaic; on the contrary, it is incredibly diverse. The formation of formalism is the fault of poor writing. Emptiness of content needs to be remedied by a deeper engagement with life; technical immaturity needs to be addressed through learning and cultivation. A good author uses his colored art brush to depict moving stories and has his own unique style.

The quality of works is generally judged by the content - at least recent commentators focus on this. From a historical standpoint and from a practical standpoint, we cannot deny this standard. Even if some people disagree, they can only sigh and say that this is an inevitable existence. Resisting the tide of the times will inevitably lead to destruction. An artistic conscience must be accompanied by an unavoidable prerequisite, which is fidelity to the times. Surely no one will raise objections?

In order to more clearly reflect the content, in order to have a moving force, and in order to achieve the artistic purpose - art should have a purpose, right? As people say, "All human endeavors, to prevent them from becoming empty and useless, must serve the interests of mankind." Therefore, we need skilled writing techniques. We are not formalists, not adherents of technical supremacy, and we know that a gorgeous tailcoat cannot hide ugliness even when worn on a scarecrow. But in view of the current phenomenon, it is necessary to remind every author of the need to strive to learn techniques. Because literature is art and nothing else.

But, it should be stated that the so-called technique is not the accumulation of flowery words. The accumulation of beautiful phrases. Literature is not word games, and superficial skills are worthless. The vivid description of images is alive. The characterization of people, the expression of the environment, the description of the atmosphere... can never be achieved by tossing around a few phrases. Therefore, we must always use our own observation and develop our own imagination. Therefore, the learning of techniques is mainly through reading the works of literary giants, but it is still related to life.

Someone said, "Writing is also a matter of life practice." The reason is probably here.

### Miscellaneous Thoughts: Two Themes

— Guo Nidi

1.  A Song

In the front building lives the young daughter of my relatives. Tonight, she is again singing "When Will You Return?"

I had been so disturbed by this song that my mood was unusually uneasy, and I shed tears of anger several times. Tonight, I know that I will undoubtedly suffer from insomnia. Ah, this terrible song!

With a round little face, she is an innocent and ignorant elementary school student. I usually like her very much, but when she starts singing this song, I extremely detest her, especially the round little face that I like.

Her teachers are probably using "When Will You Return?" as musical material to teach.

Children are ignorant, and I feel lost.

Save the children.

2.  The Third Kind of People

The situation in Shanghai is even more special.

But I am not pessimistic; on the contrary, I am somewhat excited.

There are so-called third kind of people in the world, neither revolutionary nor counter-revolutionary. They have nothing to do with politics. But are they really unrelated to politics? A fool's dream! Bah!

However, such people exist in Shanghai. Currently, they are probably the third kind of people who neither resist the war nor oppose resisting the war.

But high pressure is coming, and they will not be able to justify themselves.

Will the fox's tail eventually be revealed one day?

### The Stupidity of Seagulls

— Xing

According to old sailors, when seagulls see a ship in the vast ocean, they desperately chase after it. If they cannot catch up, and there is no place to rest along the way, they have no choice but to fall into the sea and die.

Old sailors say this, and most people who blindly worship heroes, especially poets, praise seagulls, saying that they are truly brave, and are not afraid of sacrifice in order to achieve their goals. If people were as brave as they are, the world would be more progressive.

I do not think so. The actions of seagulls are just a brute force. Not only are they not brave, but also stupid. They see a ship and want to chase it, but I cannot see what their legitimate purpose is. Maybe they think the ship will give them some comfort, but the ship ignores them. Perhaps they can get some rest on the top of the mast, but the ship will immediately drive them away. Maybe they want to express some threat to the ship, but the ship's response is a burst of bullets. Futile and unrewarding, this is nothing but stupidity.

As for not being able to catch up with the ship, and therefore dying from exhaustion, we can't find a second word to describe them other than "extremely stupid."

Originally, kites fly in the sky and fish leap in the deep. The world is vast, and everyone is free. Ships do not hinder seagulls, and seagulls do not have to hinder ships. If seagulls want to show off their strength, they will only bring about their own destruction.

I think if seagulls were not so ignorant, they might regret this unnecessary action!

### The Iron Flood

— War Zone Notes

The Prelude to the Army-Civilian Joint Celebration Opens

On the riverside square, torches are burning brightly, and the music plays a march. Thus, the firelight and singing break through the silence of the night, causing the surrounding mountains to immediately tremble, and the river roars continuously. The crowded and bustling people surge like waves. Even the places far away from the stage are full of people: men, women, old, and young, holding hands and arms, all watching the actions on the stage.

"Defend our motherland!"

The same loud sound moved the hearts of all the people in the audience. This was the roar of Division Commander Fang at the end of his speech. He is indeed a talented orator. Every word and every phrase can strike people's hearts and make countless listeners listen attentively. Usually, when he instructs the soldiers, his solemn attitude, strong tone, and clear words move people to tears. I remember in Liguo, he once persuaded the local famous bandits to surrender. In the Battle of Taierzhuang, the home-wrecking and bandit king actually led a platoon of brothers into the enemy's artillery position and single-handedly killed eleven people in one breath. However, after returning to the team with injuries, he died due to the bursting of the wound! Therefore, even during the "rushed and busy" times of war, he did not neglect political work at all. "In the near future, the Dabie Mountains will surely erupt in flames. Now is the last period for spreading the fire. Tuanfeng is especially important. If new life is not injected into each village as soon as possible, then no matter how dangerous Songziguan is, the enemy can easily cross it!" He solemnly described the meaning and purpose of the army-civilian joint celebration.

When the program proceeded to the chorus of the Chaonan War Zone Singing Troupe, the audience almost did not even make a sound of sighing. What they had was a magnificent voice, and earth-shattering applause. After that, there was a torchlight parade. Within three minutes, thousands of torches were lit together, and the raging flames were soaring. "A symbol of light!" everyone shouted like this, and happy smiles appeared on their faces.

The leader was a local 67-year-old farmer. His white hair was fluttering in the wind, but his spirit was very full. The cow that was bombed to death during the day was his "old long-term worker." "Although it is a beast, I will avenge it!" he said. At the beginning of the parade, he volunteered to lead the vast team, starting from the square, with the torches shining so brightly, passing through this village and that village, covering the mountains and fields like a living fire dragon.

This is the expression of power and the iron flood!
