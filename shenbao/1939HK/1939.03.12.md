### Some Opinions on Secondary Education Reform After the War

— Zhang Wenchang

Secondary education, being in the middle of the educational system, targets the most lively and vibrant youth. Its function must take into account both general education and vocational education. Its mission must enable students to enter institutions of higher education, while also equipping them with the qualities, attitudes, concepts, and abilities of normal and healthy citizens. As such, running a secondary school is difficult, not only in other countries but even more so in China. Because education is the upper layer of social institutions, its foundation is based on politics, economics, and all aspects of society.

Since our country adopted the Western educational system (in the 28th year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, i.e., 1902 AD), nearly forty years have passed. The educational system has been changed repeatedly, but little effect has been seen. Pessimists even believe that the country's poverty and the people's destitution are due to education, only knowing how to consume and not engage in production, only seeking superficiality and not valuing practicality. Although there is some truth in this criticism, it is not entirely accurate. There is no country in the world where politics and economics are not on track, yet education can be run well independently. Therefore, education is closely related to society. To discuss how to reform education, we must first look at the trends of society. Secondary education is a link in the entire educational system and naturally cannot be separated from this.

What will be the situation in our country after the war? We might as well make some predictions. First, our sacred war of resistance will inevitably achieve final victory. Second, our politics will inevitably move towards a republican government based on the Three Principles of the People. Third, our economy will inevitably feel extremely difficult after the war, requiring international investment, government-controlled construction, and development, and therefore urgently needing talents for construction in various fields. Fourth, our education and culture will inevitably become more developed because of this war of resistance, and a system of education suited to our own needs will be established. Public education and basic education (including primary and secondary education) will inevitably become more widespread, and higher education will inevitably become more practical and in-depth. This is an inevitable trend.

Because secondary education after the war will inevitably have the following trends: (1) the number of students will inevitably increase, (2) the economic situation of general parents will inevitably become more difficult, (3) vocational education will inevitably be more needed, (4) general education will inevitably seek to increase training and efficiency, and (5) secondary schools will inevitably become more widespread in rural towns and small cities. Therefore, the following points should be noted for the reform of secondary education after the war:

First, because the number of students is greater, the original school buildings are not enough to accommodate them, and many of the existing school buildings have been destroyed. Of course, after the war, the construction of school buildings must be planned in general. In terms of quality, only solidity is required, not luxury. In terms of quantity, the balance of classrooms, libraries, laboratories, and playgrounds should be taken into account, so that the capacity of classrooms can accommodate the number of the entire school. However, the capacity of the library, laboratory, self-study room, and playground can also accommodate the number of the entire school. If so, the Gary system or the Dalton Plan can be tried, so that one school can accommodate the students of two schools, so that the number of students in the classroom is equal to the number of students in the library, laboratory, self-study room, and playground, and so that classroom learning, experiments, self-study, and sports are rotated. If every room and every field has no empty seats, then it can accommodate twice as many students. This is much better than the half-day schools in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places that make students bored at home for half a day. Moreover, in this way, it is not only symbol recognition and knowledge infusion, but also skills training, physical exercise, and not only classroom learning but also guided self-study, which can be called complete education. Second, because the economic situation of general parents will inevitably become more difficult, in addition to reducing fees and increasing public, free, and work-study quotas, the semester system can be promoted, dividing one year into four seasons, with six weeks in the summer season for remedial classes, and the remaining three seasons of autumn, winter, and spring, each season lasting fourteen weeks. According to my experience in running a short-term experimental class at the East China United Middle School from May to July last year, fourteen weeks can complete the courses of a normal semester. The current six-year circular curriculum for senior and junior high schools has a lot of waste and repetition. For example, there are many repetitions in history, geography, science, mathematics, Chinese, and other teaching materials. If they can be re-edited, from shallow to deep, simplified, and supplemented with modern materials, and the materials for a twenty-week semester are allocated to fourteen weeks, focusing on practice, application, and experiments, then what is gained will not have the disadvantage of rote learning. A few years ago, some important officials of the National Government proposed abolishing holidays and shortening the length of the school year. Last year, the Ministry of Education ordered a few middle schools to experiment with completing six years of middle school in five years, shortening the length of the school year, which is what everyone wants. Especially in post-war China, where funding is difficult and talents are urgently needed, using the semester system instead of the term system can complete six years of middle school in four years. If there are a few students with poor grades, they will only repeat one semester, and the time will also be very economical. If there are one or two subjects that fail, they can also take remedial classes in the summer and then take supplementary exams.

Third, because vocational education is more needed due to the urgency of construction, in addition to vocational departments in higher education, secondary schools also need to train a large number of grassroots personnel in the vocational sector. However, it is very difficult to make the equipment and teachers of vocational schools satisfactory. This can be remedied by the work-study system, using the equipment and technicians of factories, farms, and hospitals to solve the difficulties of equipment and teachers. Factories that get these apprentice-style students will be more satisfied and familiar when recruiting them as employees in the future. There can still be general basic subjects and vocational theory subjects in the school to connect theory and practice. Senior students can have some wages or benefits to make up for living expenses, thereby reducing the burden on parents. The length of this type of school can be slightly longer, but experience can be greatly increased, and there will be no other way to go after graduation except for further education.

Fourth, in today's secondary schools, the basic tool subjects of Chinese, English, and mathematics are not very effective. The reason is that the goals are complex, the materials are too deep, and there is too little practice, so there is a downward trend. The reason, in addition to the issue of the selection of teaching materials, is the lack of self-study time and the inappropriateness of guidance, or even no guidance at all, such as the current half-day system. The way to remedy this is to implement strict and precise self-study guidance. There are two methods: one is to concentrate half a day on guidance (the other half day for class), schedule self-study time for major subjects, and have specialized teachers guide students in grades and groups, answer questions, practice assignments, practice answering questions, and so on. High-achieving students can also be assigned to each group as group leaders to answer easier questions. This can reduce the number of failing students and make them proficient and in-depth. One is to have self-study in class by subject, with the original teachers guiding the original assigned homework. The class time can be slightly longer, divided into two sections, with the upper section for class and the lower section for self-study, such as forty minutes or thirty minutes each. For subjects that are too numerous and cannot be allocated, major subjects can be selected, or even implemented one or two days a week. In a fifty-minute class, thirty to thirty-five minutes can be used for class, and the remaining twenty minutes or a quarter of an hour can be used for selective self-study guidance, so that the main difficulties have been solved under the guidance of the original teachers, and the students' self-study will not be as difficult as before.

Fifth, secondary schools should not only be concentrated in cities, but should also be popularized in rural towns, villages, and counties, so that secondary school students do not have to travel far from home, and at the same time, the school can be familiar with the situation of rural society and can adapt to it. Secondary schools going to the countryside is an inevitable path after the war, so that the seeds of our country can be planted in every village. But there is one difficulty, that is, there are few students, because our country's villages are small villages, and primary education has not yet been popularized, so it is advisable to choose a village or county town with a denser population and a suitable location to set it up when it is first established. If there are not many students, the composite system of the same grade or the composite system of multiple grades can be used, but the number of groups should not be more than two, so that two different levels can be carried out simultaneously without wasting time, answering questions, and self-study under the guidance of experienced teachers. Moreover, if this system is implemented, spring students and autumn students can still be recruited for composite teaching, and there will be no difficulties due to the small number of people.

Finally, we must know that how to implement the above-mentioned reforms depends on getting the right teachers. In the future, education in our country will not be about changing the system and educational system, but about the training and retention of teachers. The Ministry of Education has recently established normal colleges, giving them five years of training, focusing on specialized and professional training in addition to general subjects and basic education subjects, which is a good policy. Personality training is carried out with the tutor system, then the improvement of secondary education can be expected. However, the success of this kind of talent training will be in a few years, and may not be immediately popularized, so the in-service training of teachers in the next five or ten years is also very important. Generally, in-service teachers are not very enthusiastic about further studies. One reason is that they seek progress and recognition, but a big reason is that they are trapped by family affairs and funding. Therefore, it is natural to add one, half, or one-third of the teacher's salary to the school budget so that one teacher can be rotated to the further education class of the normal college for one year every year, two years, or every three years. During the leave period, they still receive their original salary, so the teachers have no worries, and the progress of their studies will be more effective. What do those who have quality educational administration think?

### Commemorating the Father of the National Revolution - Mr. Sun Yat-sen

— Yan Mi

Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Chinese nation's liberation struggle and the mentor of the Eastern national revolutionary movement, has been gone from us for a full fourteen years! In these fourteen years, international affairs have indeed undergone significant developments, and the situation in China has experienced even more astonishing changes. Today, as we remember Mr. Sun's life-long dedication to the liberation of the Chinese nation, we cannot help but be filled with elation and excitement. However, the state of the Republic of China, arduously established and passed down to us by Mr. Sun, now withering and shattered under the internal and external attacks of imperialism and feudal remnants, how can we not beat our chests, stamp our feet, feel guilty, and blame ourselves! But now, the full-scale war of resistance against Japan and national salvation has been launched and persisted for over twenty months. Mr. Sun's life-long aspiration to unite all parties, factions, armies, and circles across the country to establish a united front has been realized. Mr. Sun's Three Principles of the People, formed from forty years of revolutionary experience, have been established as the supreme principle of the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese nation. The Three Great Policies and the ideal of democratic politics, which Mr. Sun never forgot during his lifetime and hoped to realize, have also been unanimously recognized by the nation as the most correct policies to advance the current stage of the Chinese revolution, the war of resistance, and national reconstruction. Today, as the war of resistance turns to its second phase, all sons and daughters of the Chinese nation are inheriting Mr. Sun's revolutionary spirit, striving to complete Mr. Sun's unfinished aspirations, and fighting to create a new China with national independence, democratic rights, freedom, and people's livelihood and happiness. As we commemorate the fourteenth anniversary of Mr. Sun's death at this time, we feel not only infinite sorrow but also infinite encouragement!

(I) The Great Significance of Commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen

Our commemoration of the fourteenth anniversary of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's death today is by no means comparable to ordinary "mourning the dead and grieving the living" or "remembering former sages."

First, we must understand that Mr. Sun Yat-sen was the savior of the Chinese nation.

Before the Xinhai Revolution, the Chinese nation was in a dire situation of double oppression, on the one hand, the oppression of the dark forces of the Manchu Qing feudalism, and on the other hand, the encirclement and pressure of the great powers and imperialism, which attempted to turn China into a complete colony. This crisis was similar to the situation in Tsarist Russia before the October Revolution in the Soviet Union. Mr. Sun alone was able to synthesize the revolutionary ideas of the Enlightenment period and the experience and lessons of the national revolutionary struggle since the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, match them with the international environment and the special conditions at home, rely on his prescience and strong, unyielding determination to struggle, and a fighting spirit that grew stronger in the face of danger, to call upon the whole country, travel around China and abroad, personally experience hardship, rally comrades, unite friendly parties, overthrow the Manchu Qing, and establish the Republic, rescuing the Chinese nation from the internal and external double crisis. Therefore, it is most appropriate to call Mr. Sun Yat-sen the savior of the Chinese nation.

Second, we must also recognize that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are the highest principles of the national revolution.

Overthrowing the Manchu Qing and freeing the Chinese nation from feudal oppression was only the beginning of the revolution. To achieve the ideal of the revolution, to enable the Chinese nation to survive in the world forever and seek normal development, to thoroughly achieve the equality of the entire Chinese nation in the international arena, as well as political equality and economic equality, and to thoroughly realize national independence, democratic rights, freedom, and people's livelihood and happiness, he created the Three Principles of the People. At the same time, in order to realize the Three Principles of the People, he also formulated the National Reconstruction Program and the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, so that comrades could unite friendly parties and friendly armies according to certain guidelines and steps, and lead the national masses to work together. The history of the Republic of China for the past twenty-eight years has proven the correctness of creating a new China with the Three Principles of the People. Implementing the Three Principles of the People can save China, while abandoning the Three Principles of the People will only lead to destruction. Lenin, the "Father of World Revolution," also recognized that Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People expressed the most urgent and fundamental demands of the broadest masses of the Chinese people, calling them "ideas produced by a profound revolutionary movement of hundreds of millions of people." Every Chinese son and daughter who is loyal to the cause of national liberation should inherit this great idea, develop it in a new environment and under new conditions, and realize it.

Third, we must understand the contemporary significance of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Great Policies.

When discussing Eastern nations and the Chinese national revolutionary movement, Lenin solemnly said: "We see the truly great ideas of this great nation; this nation is not only good at weeping because of its long years of enslavement, not only good at idealizing freedom and equality, but also good at fighting against those who have long oppressed China!"

Mr. Sun was not only an outstanding modern Chinese revolutionary and thinker but also a great revolutionary strategist. He laid down the guidelines and paths for how to realize his great ideas and revolutionary goals: the Three Great Policies of the revolution (alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to peasants and workers). In his will at the time of his death, Mr. Sun said: "Based on forty years of experience, I deeply know that to achieve this goal, it is necessary to awaken the masses and unite with those nations in the world that treat us equally, and struggle together." In his letter to Lenin, the leader of the Soviet revolution, he further emphasized his fervent hope: "Dawn will soon break, at which time the Soviet Union will greet a strong and independent China as a good friend and ally." Mr. Sun also reorganized the Kuomintang in 1924, not only establishing a close united front with the Communist Party but also allowing the Communist Party to join the Kuomintang. After the reorganization of the Kuomintang in 1924, the revolutionary movement developed rapidly, and the prestige and strength of the Kuomintang also increased rapidly. The Northern Expedition went straight down, invincible; later, the split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party changed the situation. This was something that Mr. Sun could not have foreseen, but it is something that we have all experienced! These experiences clearly tell us that Mr. Sun's Three Great Policies and the advocacy of a united front are the only correct methods and paths to realize the Three Principles of the People. Without the Three Great Policies and a united front, there would be no implementation of the revolutionary Three Principles of the People.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of our national liberation movement, although he laid down the strategy and path to victory, did not live to see the success of the Chinese national revolution and left us forever! Every one of us who is loyal to the cause of national liberation should take it as our duty to continue to struggle and implement the strategies set by Mr. Sun!

(II) New Environment and New Tasks

The new environment and new conditions are very different from the time when Mr. Sun led us to fight for national liberation. However, the revolutionary Three Principles of the People and the correct Three Great Policies that Mr. Sun left us, as well as Mr. Sun's own revolutionary spirit and methods of struggle, are forever shining in our eyes. How should we use them to match the new environment and new conditions to develop and realize them?

First, the War of Resistance has been going on for more than twenty months.

In order to oppose the Japanese fascist aggression, strive for the independence, freedom, and happiness of the Chinese nation, and realize Mr. Sun's Three Principles of the People, we have heroically persisted in the War of Resistance for more than twenty months. During these twenty months, we have lost the most important cities in the country, we have sacrificed more than a million excellent sons and daughters, and we have encountered many unimaginable difficulties. However, we have annihilated seven or eight hundred thousand elite Japanese troops, we have consumed military expenses equal to the total wealth of Japan, we have increased the insurmountable difficulties of the Japanese aggressors' future, and at the same time, we have realized the national unity that has not been achieved in more than twenty years, we have washed away the national humiliation of surrendering to foreign powers for nearly a hundred years, we have increased our prestige and sympathetic assistance in the international arena, and we have discovered the promising future of persisting in united, protracted resistance and victory.

As we recall the enormous wounds and sacrifices, we should correct our shortcomings and weaknesses and strengthen our determination to resist to the end and rebuild our country. As we look at the great successes, we should raise our national self-esteem and confidence in victory and intensify our political progress to win the final victory. Today, in the negative aspect, we must recall Mr. Sun's past spirit of resolutely opposing feudal forces, opposing the exploiting class, opposing double-dealers, and opposing defeatism, in order to sweep away these obstacles to the future of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. In the positive aspect, we must recall Mr. Sun's lifelong advocacy of raising the national self-esteem and self-confidence of the entire nation and mobilizing the dynamic strength of the entire nation to advance the War of Resistance and national reconstruction to success and victory.

Second, the united front is strengthening and developing.

Since the full-scale outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, we are most fortunate that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the largest political parties leading the Chinese national revolution, have moved from division to unity, thereby starting to realize an unprecedentedly solid unity throughout the country. For more than twenty months since the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and all anti-Japanese parties have been able to achieve closer cooperation despite the very serious obstruction and attacks from traitors and collaborators, making the anti-Japanese national united front continue to consolidate and develop, and providing the greatest guarantee for the final victory of the revolutionary cause of the entire nation's War of Resistance and national reconstruction. This guarantee is now being recognized by the world with the sympathetic aid to China movement. It is our glory that we can faithfully implement the solemn instructions and the path that Mr. Sun gave us and once led. However, the painful experience of the past fifteen years should also teach every Chinese son and daughter engaged in the cause of national revolution that we must understand that Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and the united front are not only cooperation in the War of Resistance but may and must be long-term cooperation in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, because only in this way can we guarantee the final success of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. At the same time, the current stage of Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and the united front is not yet sufficiently consolidated and developed, and therefore cannot give a fatal blow to the enemy, making them lose their offensive power, so that we can launch a counter-offensive and recover lost territories. Therefore, today we should further consolidate and develop Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and the united front to commemorate our leader Mr. Sun Yat-sen. In particular, to Generalissimo Chiang, who is leading the entire nation in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, and leading us to consolidate and expand Kuomintang-Communist cooperation and the united front, we should pay great respect and enthusiastic support!

Third, the removal of pro-Japanese compromisers:

In leading the national revolutionary struggle, Mr. Sun used the most stern and resolute attitude to deal with all wavering, compromising, and rebellious elements within the party, and used the most sincere and frank attitude to welcome talents from outside the party to participate in and enrich the strength of the party, so that the Kuomintang grew rapidly from arduous struggles. The reorganization in 1924 can be regarded as a model for a healthy revolutionary camp in the world's national revolutionary struggles. Now, when Generalissimo Chiang leads the Three Principles of the People's War of Resistance against Japan and discovers a small number of corrupt, stubborn, selfish, and pro-Japanese compromisers within the party, he immediately removes them with the most serious and resolute attitude; for example, the expulsion of the traitor Wang Jingwei from the party has aroused enthusiastic support from national public opinion. At the same time, Generalissimo Chiang's impartial attitude towards talents from outside the party, solemnly introducing, helping, and closely cooperating with them, is even more praised by Chinese and foreign public opinion. To commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen today, we must understand Mr. Sun Yat-sen's attitude and support Generalissimo Chiang's attitude, especially at this time when some pro-Japanese traitors and compromisers continue to lurk and undermine unity and resistance. We must more seriously and earnestly learn from Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Generalissimo Chiang.

Fourth, the characteristics of the new stage of the War of Resistance

The characteristic of the current stage of the War of Resistance is that the situation is dramatically changing from the enemy being superior and we being inferior to the enemy and us being evenly matched, it is entering the second phase from the first phase, from the first stage of retreat to the second stage of stalemate, and the third stage of preparing for a counter-offensive. In this stage, the enemy's domestic and international difficulties are increasing day by day to the point of being irreparable, while at the same time we are becoming stronger as we fight, and the domestic and international situation is also becoming more and more favorable, gradually reaching the stage of stopping the enemy's offensive and developing our army's counter-offensive. But at the same time, we must know that the enemy's offensive strength has not completely disappeared, and a new and most cruel offensive is being actively promoted, and the "anti-communist" truce plot to undermine our national united, protracted resistance is also continuing. The crisis of the Chinese nation's demise has not passed. We commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen to overcome new difficulties with Mr. Sun's forty years of unyielding and unremitting spirit and finally defeat Japan.

Fifth, the trend of the international situation

Recently, the international situation has more clearly divided into two major camps: one is the fascist aggression camp. Under the "anti-communist" pact, Japan, Germany, and Italy are actively promoting a major war to attack England, America, and France and re-divide the world. The other is the democratic peace camp, and the rulers of the capitalist countries that advocate democratic peace are still continuing to compromise and concede. However, the U.S. government, under the more insane threat of fascism, has responded to the Soviet Union's call for democratic and peaceful countries to jointly sanction dictatorial and aggressive countries, and the broad masses of people around the world are more actively building, consolidating, and developing an anti-fascist and anti-aggression front. We are now doing the vanguard of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression struggle. Today, we should further follow Mr. Sun's will to "unite with those nations in the world that treat us equally and struggle together," especially to unite with the Soviet Union, the pillar of world peace, and to unite with democratic countries such as England, America, and France to consolidate the peaceful front, resist and oppose the fascist and anti-aggression forces, and strive for national liberation and world peace.

(III) How to Commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen

We have already proposed how we should develop and realize Mr. Sun's ideas and revolutionary ideals based on the new environment and new conditions, pointing out the path to win the success of the current War of Resistance and national reconstruction and to realize Mr. Sun's Three Principles of the People. We also need to raise the question of how to commemorate the fourteenth anniversary of Mr. Sun's death. The following three points should be our minimum requirements for each of us. First, we must learn Mr. Sun's revolutionary spirit.

Mr. Sun fought heroically for forty years to lead the entire nation to realize China's independence and freedom. He gave all his spiritual strength to the great cause of national liberation and national revolution. Until his dying breath, he still exhorted his party members and the people of the whole country to continue to complete his legacy. Moreover, Mr. Sun began his revolutionary career by opposing the corrupt and dark Manchu Qing autocratic government, and went through opposing the rapacious and brutal warlord rule and the aggression of international imperialism. In Mr. Sun's lifelong heroic struggle, his persistence, his unyielding spirit in the face of danger, his unwavering determination in the face of difficulties, his self-sacrifice for the country, his integrity and selflessness, his extreme and earnest sympathy for the laboring masses, and his extreme and deep hatred for oppressors and exploiters, all fully embody the noble spirit and heroic spirit of our Chinese nation, and all serve as models for today's soldiers, men, and women youths who are working for the cause of national liberation.

Second, we must strive to thoroughly realize the revolutionary Three Principles of the People.

What are the Three Principles of the People? Mr. Sun's "Manifesto of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang" clearly told us:

"(1) Nationalism: The Kuomintang's nationalism has two meanings: first, the Chinese nation seeks liberation, and second, all ethnic groups within China are equal. In the first aspect, the purpose of the Kuomintang's nationalism is to make the Chinese nation independent and free in the world. ... In the second aspect, ... the Kuomintang dares to solemnly declare: to recognize the self-determination of all ethnic groups within China. After the victory of the revolution against imperialism and warlords, a free and unified Republic of China (a united Republic of ethnic groups) will be formed.

(2) Democracy: The Kuomintang's democracy ... all individuals and groups that truly oppose imperialism shall enjoy all freedoms and rights, and all traitors who serve imperialism and warlords, whether they are groups or individuals, shall not enjoy such freedoms and rights.

(3) People's Livelihood: The Kuomintang's principle of people's livelihood has no more important principles than two: one is equal land ownership, and the other is restriction of capital. ... The state should give land to farmers who lack land and become tenants, and provide them with land to cultivate, and organize water conservancy and transplant wasteland to equalize land fertility. The state should set up regulatory agencies such as farmers' banks to supply their needs for farmers who lack capital and borrow at high interest rates and are burdened with debt for life, so that farmers can enjoy the joy of life they deserve. ... The state should seek relief for unemployed workers, and especially formulate labor laws to improve the lives of workers. In addition, systems such as old-age care, childcare, care for the disabled, and universal education, which have mutually supportive characteristics, should all be strived to realize. All of this is the affair of the people's livelihood."

We recall that the main reason why the Northern Expedition developed so rapidly and was invincible was that the army was filled with revolutionary spirit, and the peasants and workers unanimously assisted, and the fundamental reason was the propaganda and agitation of the revolutionary Three Principles of the People, especially the slogan of striving for the political and economic equality of peasants and workers and their revolutionary leadership. In this stage where we are fighting for the final victory of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction on the ground, we should appeal to "thoroughly realize the revolutionary Three Principles of the People" in order to seek equality in international status, equality in political status, and equality in economic status, in order to realize national independence, democratic rights, freedom, and people's livelihood and happiness.

Third, the necessary conditions for winning the second stage of the War of Resistance

In leading the struggle to save the Chinese nation, Mr. Sun, based on his life's struggle experience, indicated to us the direction and path of struggle, which are the great Three Great Policies and the advocacy of a united front. Today's new environment and new conditions more urgently require us to thoroughly realize Mr. Sun's Three Great Policies and the principles of the united front. To put it concretely, today we must concentrate all our strength, and politically we must: (1) support Generalissimo Chiang, support the National Government, support Kuomintang-Communist cooperation, oppose division and splitting, and oppose any traitorous puppet regime; (2) implement democratic politics under centralized leadership, closely link the government with the people, and maximize the ability of the anti-Japanese regime; (3) expand the unified mass movement and fully support the war; (4) unite all Chinese ethnic groups, Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Miao, Yao, and Yi, and grant equal rights to "jointly resist Japan" and establish a unified country; (5) promote the movement to eliminate traitors and consolidate the front line and the rear; (6) develop the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and anti-Japanese parties, strengthen the united front, and persist in the protracted war of resistance. Secondly, in military terms, (1) improve the combat effectiveness of the main force, defend Central China, South China, and Northwest China, and stop the enemy's offensive; (2) expand and develop guerrilla warfare behind the enemy, create and consolidate our base areas, reduce the enemy's occupied areas, and cooperate with the main force in combat; (3) improve military technology and create mechanized corps, and prepare for counter-offensive strength. Next, in economic terms, (1) implement new wartime financial and economic policies to adapt to the new needs of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction; (2) improve the lives of the people and stimulate the people's enthusiasm for the War of Resistance and production. Next, in cultural terms, (1) highly promote national self-esteem and self-confidence, persist in the War of Resistance to the end, overcome pessimistic and disappointed emotions, and oppose compromising attempts; (2) implement the anti-Japanese education policy, so that education serves the protracted War of Resistance, create and expand various cadre schools, train a large number of anti-Japanese cadres, and extensively develop mass education to improve the national culture and national consciousness of the people. In addition, in foreign relations, we must implement: (1) strive for international assistance, unite with the Soviet Union that treats us equally, unite with democratic and peaceful countries such as England, America, and France, and concentrate our forces to defeat Japanese imperialism; (2) establish a unified anti-aggression front between Chinese and Japanese soldiers and civilians and [illegible] to jointly oppose [illegible].

At this new stage when the Chinese national liberation war is in full swing, and at this new stage when the international situation is dramatically turning in our favor, as we commemorate the leader of the national liberation struggle and the mentor of the Eastern revolution, we should learn his arduous and outstanding revolutionary history, hold high his banner of the Three Principles of the People, which represent the great ideas of our great nation, we should loyally follow his Three Great Policies, consolidate and develop the anti-Japanese national united front, and work together to drive out the common enemy of the entire nation and the whole world and welcome an independent, free, and happy China and a truly peaceful world!

### The Greatness of the Premier

— He

Today is the 14th anniversary of the death of our Founding Father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen. All citizens of the Republic of China, when drinking water, think of its source, and should not forget Mr. Sun Yat-sen, who painstakingly created this Republic of China. All citizens of the Republic of China should fervently commemorate the painstaking efforts and significance of Mr. Sun Yat-sen in establishing the Republic of China, and resolutely implement the Three Principles of the People and the Three Great Policies advocated by Mr. Sun Yat-sen.

Just now, when I read the Premier's testament to the phrase "treat me as an equal nation," I felt infinitely touched. This time, Britain has been extremely helpful to us, and recently even assisted us with huge sums of money, which is enough to know that righteous countries are never afraid of not being sympathized with. I still remember Mr. Sun's efforts in the revolution in those years, and I also clearly remember the words he exhorted us with when he was dying. Mr. Sun was not a man with an army, nor was he an official of the Manchu Qing government at the time, nor was he a man with a wealthy property, but only a younger brother from a middle-class family—a young student of medicine. I know that because he studied medicine, he had a heart of compassion for all people. Expanding the compassionate heart of treating individuals, he then had the ambition to treat people and the country, thereby treating the Chinese people who were suffering from the oppression and devastation of the Manchu Qing imperial system. At that time, although the politics of the Manchu Qing imperial system were corrupt, they oppressed the people internally and lost power and humiliated the country externally. However, that ruling force still stubbornly resisted, acting arbitrarily and doing whatever they wanted. They exhausted the people's wealth, leading to a life of misery for the people. Mr. Sun, with his unparalleled spirit, went through ten failures, still unyielding, and finally overthrew the imperial rule that had hindered progress for thousands of years, and created this independent and free Republic of China. However, because the remnants of the reactionary forces at that time had not been completely eliminated, this resulted in a situation of warlord separatism for many years, with compatriots destroying each other and the people suffering, no less than during the rule of the Manchu Qing imperial system. Mr. Sun, with his profound insight into the national situation, specifically proposed the Three Principles of the People and the Three Great Policies in 1924—alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers. Later, because the soldiers of that year could not fully carry out the teachings, Mr. Sun then came to the north to expand publicity and abolish unequal treaties. On the way through Japan, he saw through the conspiracy of the invaders and was determined to resist. We, the compatriots who died later, can understand it by reading his testament. Later, due to the hardships of travel, the old illness recurred, and in the winter of that year, the condition became more serious. As the unification of the North and South was not achieved, Mr. Sun entrusted his unfinished ambition to the revolutionary comrades who died later on this day fourteen years ago. Mr. Sun's breathing also stopped with his instructions—to save China through peace and struggle.

At the time of his death, I remember there were three testaments: one was for the revolutionary comrades who died later, asking them to continue their efforts and fight together; one was for Madam Sun; and one was for Soviet Russia, hoping that the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union could truly unite after Mr. Sun's death. At that time, there were many revolutionary comrades surrounding Mr. Sun. Some of these comrades have already been implementing Mr. Sun's testament, leading the resistance against the violent ×; however, some have gone down the road of counter-revolution in this difficult journey, shouting about making peace with the invaders. Are these the words of Mr. Sun's revolutionary comrades? They are not only not Mr. Sun's comrades, but also traitors of the Chinese nation. They have even lost the nature of being Chinese. I still remember that when Mr. Sun took office as the Provisional President in Nanjing, someone suggested to Mr. Sun that the handling of external and internal × people should not be too extreme. Mr. Sun immediately replied, "Our purpose is revolution. If the country cannot achieve independence and freedom externally, and the people's lives cannot be resolved internally, then why should we devote ourselves to revolution?" I still remember these words very clearly in my mind, and I also understand very well. I always use them to measure my actions to see if I have violated Mr. Sun's revolutionary proposition. I also remember that thirty-six or seven years ago, when Mr. Sun went to Japan from Honolulu for the second time and began to organize the Tongmenghui, Mr. Liao Zhongkai and I also joined. The overseas students who joined successively came from seventeen provinces. At that time, Mr. Sun proposed nationalism, expelling the Tartars, restoring the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation; proposed democracy, seeking equal political status for all ethnic groups in China, establishing the Republic of China, and establishing a democratic republic; and proposed the people's livelihood, equalizing land ownership and alleviating the painful lives of the people. Because I was very close to Mr. Sun, I understood his revolutionary ideas very thoroughly. The following is continued on page three.

### Our New Strategy in Central Hubei - Stability in Jiangxi and Hunan - Consolidation of the Longhai Railway - Fierce Battle in Jing Le - Recapture of Nangong

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 11th] Jingmen telegram, the war in central Hubei, we have launched a new strategy, in addition to consolidating the existing defenses, and in Jingmen, Zhongxiang, and the Hanyi roads, respectively, attacked and encircled, the overall situation has turned favorable. Zhongxiang Yi shelled the west bank of the Xiang River on the morning of the 11th, Yuekou Yi was attacked by us and showed signs of retreat. Changshou shop north of Zhongxiang, Yangzi town Yi is taking a defensive posture, Hua Xiang Road Yi is increasing its attempts to attack fiercely. For three days, the sound of artillery fire on the Zhe River bank has not stopped, Yi shelled the city of Suizhou, we have no major losses.

[Special Dispatch from Luoyang, 11th] The situation in the western section of the Longhai Railway is tense, and a unit of our army is reinforcing that area. After the recent major adjustment of the front-line troops, the strength has increased sharply. A commando team has crossed the Yellow River to intercept the Yi. According to a certain source, Hu Yukun has arrived in Kaifeng to take office as the puppet Henan pacification director.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, 11th] Xi'an telegram, Jin Yi has recently mobilized again, with some groups, ranging from two to three thousand to a little over a thousand people, or several hundred people, launching offensives in various places and attacking our guerrilla troops. Moreover, Yi has been storing grain, stockpiling weapons, and repairing roads at various railway and highway points, showing active intentions. However, our forces in Jin are larger than those of ×, controlling the overall situation. If a fierce battle breaks out, we will certainly inflict heavy damage on ×. × has established a military base in Heng County, Jinbei. × chieftain Lieutenant General Yanagawa is also in the area. Approximately three to four thousand × in the Fenxi Hua'an, Fencheng, and Tudou areas. After Hongdong × invaded Guyang Village, it first disturbed Qinyuan, and we have taken strict precautions. × advanced from Zhaocheng and was ambushed by us in Yangjiazhuang and Shaguoli, suffering heavy casualties. Ling Shi Yi attacked Jingsheng town, Junzhai village, and also suffered heavy losses. We attacked Gu County, and × was very panicked. After our troops launched surprise attacks everywhere in the territory of Ji and Lu, the fierceness gradually diminished. We have recently made new progress.

[Special Dispatch from Chang'an City, 11th] The number of Yi in Gucheng (west of Fencheng) has increased to more than 500 people and are currently in fierce battle with our forces in the Sanggong Village (west of Gucheng) area.

[Reuters Chongqing, 11th] According to Chinese sources, there is currently a fierce battle in Jingle, located northwest of Taiyuan in central Shanxi Province. When the Japanese army attacked the city that day, the Chinese army immediately withdrew. However, after the Japanese army occupied it, the Chinese army returned to surround it, and fierce fighting is currently underway.

The ×, who continue to occupy Tongcheng and Yuezhou, are still strengthening their fortifications, preparing for a long defense. Observers believe that since × invaded the Hunan-Hubei Highway and the northern section of the Yuehan Railway, they have encountered unprecedented and significant difficulties. The most obvious are as follows: First, our regular army and guerrilla forces are closely monitoring × from all sides, constantly launching surprise attacks and assaults. The deeper they advance, the deeper they sink. The more they retreat, the more thorns they face. Second, in the mountainous area of the Hunan-Hubei border, modern transportation has lost its effectiveness. Climbing over towering mountains not only makes it impossible to move heavy weapons, but even walking is difficult. This kind of revival of primitive-era transportation is by no means something × can get used to. Third, the people are able to unite against the enemy and fight more and more bravely. They are thoroughly aware of the deception and enslavement of ×, and they are able to provide everything they have to meet our needs for punishment and development. The cohesion of the soldiers is even stronger. × has no way to implement their wolfish poison. Therefore, the × who invaded the Hunan-Hubei border area for four months have been consistently rejected in the suburbs of Tongcheng and Yuezhou, without any development.

[Special Dispatch from Guilin, 11th] There has been no increase in the number of × on Hainan Island. Our guerrilla teams are active everywhere. The Ikeda Regiment of × has suffered more than one-third of its casualties. There has been fighting near Anding in recent days.

### National Spiritual Mobilization Begins - Central Government Promulgates Convention Outline Implementation Plan - Organize Mobilization Association - Chairman Chiang Concurrently Serves as President

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] President Chiang, concurrently Chairman of the National Defense Supreme Council, recognizing the importance of national spiritual mobilization, previously formulated the Outline of National Spiritual Mobilization, which was submitted to the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and personally reported at the Third Congress of the National Political Council. All councilors unanimously and enthusiastically approved it. The aforementioned Outline of National Spiritual Mobilization and Implementation Measures have now been announced by the National Defense Supreme Council and have begun to be implemented. The National Defense Supreme Council has also organized the Spiritual Mobilization Association, which will soon be established. Chairman Chiang concurrently serves as the president and presides over it. In addition, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee passed nine articles of the National Anti-Japanese War Convention, and the Third Congress of the National Political Council supplemented them with three articles, totaling twelve articles, as the National Anti-Japanese War Oath. Now, Chairman Chiang has decided to adopt the original text passed by the National Political Council and named it "National Convention." He has also made it a concrete starting method for national spiritual mobilization by having the people swear to implement the convention. He has specifically incorporated it into the implementation measures so that the people of the country can implement it uniformly. The full text of the outline, the National Convention, and the actual measures of spiritual mobilization are published as follows:

Mobilization Outline

Introduction

Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, more than a year and a half has passed. Relying on the solidarity of our entire country and the courage to sacrifice everything, we have thwarted the arrogance of ×× and depleted the strength of the × army. The reputation of the country has increased, and the world has paid attention. However, the second phase of the War of Resistance has now begun, and the future is long. The efforts required of our people to overcome difficulties will be greater than in the previous phase. Today, × people know that military force is not enough to subdue us and achieve their goal of a quick resolution. Therefore, their most recent plan is to shake our will and threaten our spirit in various ways. We have observed that the historical disasters of our country were all due to the fear of the × people in the spirit of the officials and people, which made them unable to exert the strength of our nation. The lessons of the Song and Ming Dynasties are still fresh in our minds. Therefore, what we should focus on today is the revitalization and concentration of our spirit. In other words, in the previous stage of the War of Resistance, military affairs and spirit were equally important, while in the second and later stages of the War of Resistance, spirit is even more important than military affairs. It is not enough to overcome difficulties and strike at the × people's poisonous plan to win through spiritual control without raising the strong and unyielding spirit of our people. Looking back at the experience of fighting for the past eighteen months and examining its shortcomings, the lack of material conditions is very obvious, but the unpreparedness of spiritual conditions is even more important. Modern warfare is a war of national mobilization. Therefore, we should not only mobilize all the materials and manpower in the country, but also mobilize the spirit of the people of the country. Mobilizing the spirit of the people of the country to enrich the national strength of the War of Resistance is not only about launching, but also about organizing and maintaining. We must use organized spirit to exert organized manpower and organized materials to meet the current needs of the country. Moreover, the meaning of this war of resistance is not only limited to eliminating the invasion of the violent ×, but also to establishing a permanent foundation for post-war reconstruction in the midst of hard fighting. Its task is heavy and its mission is great. It will be an unprecedentedly difficult battle in the history of our country. Looking back at today's society, although the foundation of unity has been established, the unity of spirit has not been achieved. Although there are many performances of loyalty, bravery, and vigor, the state of decadence and dispersion also coexists. The slackness of the organization and the weakness of the foundation are not enough for such a national spirit to bear the great responsibility of the country's prosperity and decline. Therefore, we cannot but recognize that the actual implementation of the national spiritual mobilization is the top priority today. The so-called national spiritual mobilization, from the literal meaning, is to concentrate all the individual's consciousness, thinking, intelligence, and spiritual power in one direction and improve its use. For the whole nation, it is to concentrate the spiritual power of all ages, occupations, thoughts, and lives in one goal, and jointly encourage and increase it, regulate it neatly, and exert it, and determine the center of the organization to enhance its efficiency. The expression of spiritual power is morality, and its expression must be attributed to faith. As the ancients said, "Success comes from one, failure comes from two or three." This is true for everything, especially in military affairs. Moreover, our people are in a wartime where survival is at stake. Therefore, as far as China is concerned today, the national spiritual mobilization should mean concentrating the spirit of the people across the country on a simple common goal, so that the people across the country can establish the same patriotic morality for themselves and firmly establish the same national construction faith for the country. Every member of the people can fight and sacrifice for the same faith based on the same moral concept. What has been stated here seems very ordinary, but the revival of the Chinese nation must follow this path. If we can truly implement national spiritual mobilization in a unified manner, then any difficulty can be shouldered, any difficulty can be overcome, and the final victory is inevitable. Conversely, if the people cannot understand and practice this, or if the understanding is not true and the practice is not consistent, then the national crisis will increase and it will be more difficult to defeat ×. Therefore, the future of the War of Resistance, the fate of the nation, and the success or failure of safety are all tied to the one move of national spiritual mobilization. Therefore, we will elaborate its essentials and discuss them in sections, hoping that our people will accept and practice them in a unified manner.

National spiritual mobilization has three simple and clear common goals that are easy for everyone to understand and practice. It is the spirit that the nation should gather and should be first declared, namely (1) the country first, the nation first, (2) military first, victory first, and (3) concentrated will, concentrated strength.

The Country First, The Nation First

Today, all people, regardless of intelligence, should have a keen sense that in the situation where the survival of the nation is under threat, any individual and their career cannot be guaranteed their safety. The × people's desire to eliminate our people and disintegrate our national unity will first split us and then enslave and eliminate us. Their ambitions and poisonous plans have become increasingly clear. Therefore, consolidating national survival should be prior to everything else. However, the highest system of national life is the state. Without the state, national life cannot be maintained and developed. The people who lose their country are like the Jews, who are slaughtered by others. How tragic. Therefore, consolidating the state should be even more important than everything else. Therefore, we must recognize today that the country is first, the nation is first, and the interests of the country and the nation should be higher than everything else. Before the country and the nation, we should sacrifice all selfish opinions, selfish hearts, selfish interests, and even sacrifice personal freedom and life.

Military First, Victory First

In this military period of resolving the survival of the nation, the greatest interest of the country and the nation is the military interest. Therefore, all the thoughts and actions of the people should be absolutely subject to the control of the military interests of the country and the nation. In order to achieve the interests of the military and to increase the interests of the military, the country and the nation may require the people to make all sacrifices, and the people must also automatically and enthusiastically contribute everything they have. Therefore, it is said that the military is first. The only purpose of the military is to seek victory. Therefore, the people must establish the belief in victory and achieve the purpose of final victory. They must also devote all their knowledge and all their time and energy to seek military victory. In this period, there should be no so-called personal gains and losses, personal interests, or personal humiliation and honor. Only seeking military victory is the glory shared by all our people, and the failure to achieve victory is the greatest shame for everyone. All merits and demerits, all right and wrong, should be judged by this standard. Therefore, it is also said that victory is first.

Concentrated Will, Concentrated Strength

When our country is in a time of national emergency and self-defense, all the wills of the people should be concentrated and all the strengths should be concentrated. The rational and conscientious people should have no time for other thoughts or actions except to do their best to consolidate the country and seek victory. As far as the country and the nation are concerned, it is also necessary to require the absolute unity of thought of the whole people, concentrating on the country first, the nation first, and the military first, victory first. No divergence or doubt is allowed, and no other fantasies or empty theories are allowed. It is even more necessary to mobilize all the people of all professions and departments to concentrate on fighting for the military interests of the country and the nation. In the midst of hardships, each should do his best and do his job to improve everything and create everything, so as to implement the long-term military plan and at the same time achieve the completion of our national construction work. Therefore, it is said that the will is concentrated and the strength is concentrated. The above three meanings are very simple and clear, and things are extremely easy to do. The people must be happy to accept and accept them in a unified manner. Please elaborate on the content of the same principle and the same belief that we ask to establish (to be continued).

[Special Dispatch from Kunming, 11th] When the Academia Sinica Council meets on the 13th, it is said that Weng Wen, Wang Shijie, and Zhu Jiahua will come to Yunnan to attend.

### Bombing of Yichang American Church - Detailed Report Received in Chongqing

[Special Dispatch from Changsha, 11th] Jingmen telegram, the Japanese planes attacked Yichang for days, and the huge amount of military supplies we originally stored there had already been transported to a safe area. The bombing by the Japanese planes caused no military losses to us.

[Reuters Chongqing, 11th] Regarding the bombing of Yichang by Japanese planes on the 7th and 8th of this month, this question received a foreign message from Xuan Chang today, saying that a bomb fell on the Scottish Church School, seven bombs fell on the Anglican Church School, and two bombs destroyed foreign residences. All the houses were damaged by the bombing. The two national flags on the ground were bombed to powder. Ms. Cheri Bay, an executive officer, escaped unharmed. A piece of bomb shrapnel fell within fifteen feet of her. The Meihua School, run by the American Anglican Church, was flying the American flag and was hit by six bombs. The Scottish Church School that was also bombed also had a foreign flag. The number of casualties in the city is not yet known, but it is believed to be over 1,500.

### Food Panic in Japan - Labor Shortage in Dalian

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 10th] New York, Tas telegram, the American "New Republic" magazine published an article on the situation in Japan, saying that because most of Japan's food is used to supply the army, all cities and villages in Japan have felt a lack of food. The Japanese people are suffering from malnutrition and their health is greatly impaired, and epidemics are also widespread. Since the beginning of the war, cholera and lung disease have greatly increased.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 11th] Dalian foreign news, now is the time for spring plowing, and a total of 900,000 coolies are needed here. Due to the shortage of labor, there are as many as 30 cargo ships moored in the port ready to depart.

### German Merchant Cotton Mill Occupied - German Consul Protests to Japan - Hankou Consular Corps Protests the Seizure of Cemetery Land

[Reuters Shanghai, 11th] The German Consul General here protested to the Japanese authorities today because Japan occupied two German merchant cotton mills in Nantong and Haimen. The two cotton mills originally belonged to Chinese people. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, they were taken over by the German merchant Aichi Electric Power Company and operated as usual. It is said that the company had previously refused to cooperate with the Japanese side.

[Associated Press Hankou, 11th] The Consular Corps here has recently protested to the Japanese authorities against the Japanese navy's occupation of the site of the International Cemetery here for the purpose of storing military supplies.

### Increased Foreign Trade in January This Year - Increased Credit from Various Countries - The Future of the War of Resistance is Increasingly Bright

[Hong Kong News] In January this year, China's trade with various countries, imports and exports of goods, have increased compared with the same period last year. This shows that the credit of various countries to us has not been affected by our country being in a period of war, but has instead increased day by day. This makes the future of our final victory brighter and more assured. According to the Customs Import Trade Statistics Monthly Report, the total value of China's imports in January this year was 85.34 million national currency, an increase of 25.965 million yuan compared with the same period last year. The total value of exports in January this year was 28.212 million yuan, an increase of 9.061 million yuan compared with the same period last year. The import surplus in January this year was 17.546 million yuan, an increase of 1.318 million yuan compared with the same period last year. The following is an excerpt of the total trade value of China with the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan for those who are concerned about the trend of trade (the numbers in the table are in thousands of national currency units).

### × In North China (Below) Currency Policy Failure: North China People's Faith in Legal Tender Fades; Confession of Mitsuchi Chuzo, a Japanese

Many Methods

To overcome the aforementioned currency obstacles in North China, and in fact, many methods have already been implemented, in order to encourage the people to trust the new banknotes, the "United Reserve Bank" must obtain a sufficient amount of foreign currency deposits, and when necessary, use these foreign currencies to sell foreign exchange. Japanese financial commissioners stationed in China and the management department of the "United Reserve Bank" are currently making hopeful efforts to increase the "Bank's" strength in this regard. For the same purpose, the North China "authorities" have adopted a foreign exchange control system and implemented certain restrictions on foreign trade. A more pressing and specific issue is how to deal with the end of the old legal tender circulation period in March. As mentioned above, as of now,

400 Million Yuan

Only 13 million yuan has been recovered. The course of action thereafter will largely depend on the situation at the end of the period, but no matter what method is taken, the legal tender that has been in circulation for a long time may continue to circulate. The currency problem in Central China is quite similar to that in North China. Our country's (referring to Japan's) military expenses are still paid with "military scrip." But in general, the people's trust in "military scrip" is by no means higher than the North China people's trust in the "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, and in some inland areas, the Japanese military authorities have had to purchase legal tender with their own banknotes before they can purchase anything. It was previously predicted that after the fall of Guangzhou, the legal tender would depreciate, but the fact is

Quite the Opposite

The value of legal tender has instead risen, and legal tender has become a heavy burden on the Japanese bank notes in the aforementioned form. The strength of the legal tender may be due to the efforts of HSBC. No matter what happens to Chiang Kai-shek's fate, the value of legal tender will still be maintained, because there is a surplus between imports and exports. The Japanese army will continue to purchase goods with "military scrip," which will be converted into legal tender, and then the legal tender will be exchanged for foreign currency. Therefore, the fundamental problem is how to deal with legal tender. This clearly requires the establishment of a bank in Central China that issues independent banknotes. Although this bank does not need to operate on a large scale, it should be sufficiently strong from the beginning to be able to temporarily disregard the legal tender, and attempt to recover it during a designated period, as was done in North China, and should directly strive to increase foreign commerce. The "bank" among the great powers may increase its foreign currency deposits. This "bank" should not be a purely Chinese institution, but a joint venture of Chinese and Japanese capital, and its new banknotes should not be linked to Japanese bank notes like the "United Reserve Bank" banknotes. The reason for this is obvious. If the "bank" is prepared to sell foreign exchange, then its exchange value can be allowed to follow its own course. (End)

### All-England Aid China Conference: Archbishop of York Praises Our Country; Stimson Appointed President of the Sino-American Association

[Reuter's London, 10th] A national aid China dinner was held here tonight. The Archbishop of York delivered a speech on the spot, praising China's heroic resistance against Japan, and said, "I feel ashamed that the great powers cannot unite to save China from suffering." Chairwoman Ms. Fry said that the British people have not fully understood the Far East events, and how great their impact is on Britain. If Japan wins, one-fifth of the world's people will be reduced to the suffering of semi-colonization.

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 11th] The Sino-American Cultural Association, which was recently established in Chongqing, recommended former US Secretary of State Stimson as the honorary president of the association. A telegram has been received from Washington stating that Mr. Stimson has agreed to assume the position.

### Female Aviator Li Xiaqing Promotes in the US

[Associated Press New York, 11th] Chinese female aviator Li Xiaqing (Li Dan), who has been giving speeches across the United States recently, said in a speech here today, "Chinese women are now working hard to serve the country. After completing my mission in the United States, I will return to China to plan the training of female aviators and rescue teams. What China urgently needs at the moment is doctors and medical supplies. Currently, each doctor has to treat an average of a thousand wounded soldiers. Sometimes, wounded soldiers have to crawl for several days before they can get medical treatment. There are also quite a few people who die on the way. Chinese women are determined to drive out the invaders and are willing to make any sacrifices." It is reported that Ms. Li will give speeches in forty cities in the United States, requesting donations to China, donations of funds and medical supplies.

### British Loan to Aid China: Japan Plans to Protest to Britain; Arita Says in Parliament That It Is Under Study; Market Chaos After Legal Tender Ban in North China

[Reuter's Tokyo, 11th] Japanese Foreign Minister Arita declared in the Japanese Parliament last night that Japan must study whether it is appropriate to lodge a protest with Britain regarding the establishment of a £10 million fund to stabilize Chinese currency. He said that the Japanese government believes that although this fund is intended to stabilize Chinese legal tender to guarantee British economic interests, its effect will inevitably strengthen the "Chiang regime."

[Reuter's Peiping, 11th] After the new currency law of the pseudo-"Preparation Bank" began to be implemented here yesterday, the market was extremely chaotic. Today it has been calmer. Officials formally announced that Peiping, Tianjin, Yantai and Qingdao are also included in the "Preparation Bank Zone." According to reliable sources from responsible parties, the Japanese Chambers of Commerce in North China have telegraphed Tokyo, requesting that the implementation of this new law be postponed, and at least hope that the aforementioned four major cities will not be subject to it for the time being, but it has not been approved.

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 10th] Peiping News: The Chinese newspapers here do not publish any text regarding the establishment of the Sino-British loan, which may be due to the extensive adverse publicity by the newspapers in recent days. According to foreign banking circles, the price of Chinese legal tender has become more stable due to the loan, and the price of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes will secretly fall. As for the general Chinese people, they are even more unwilling to exchange their savings of legal tender for the banknotes of the United Reserve Bank.

### The Greatness of the Premier (Continued from Page 2)

— He Xiangning

At the same time, revolutionary enthusiasm was also high. We deeply felt his influence when we traveled to various overseas Chinese communities, and it was particularly profound. Therefore, at this moment when the national liberation war against the invaders is entering a new and favorable stage, we are, however, a country that has been in political chaos for more than twenty years, and we can estimate the difficult future ahead. However, knowing ourselves and knowing our enemy, our responsibility is significant, our work should not be delayed for a moment, and our strength must be concentrated. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we should earnestly implement the revolutionary Three Principles of the People and the three major policies that Mr. Sun resolutely advocated—alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers.

All people of the Republic of China, revolutionary comrades of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and people with conscience, should assume the responsibility of realizing Mr. Sun's unfinished revolutionary aspirations. In order to realize Mr. Sun's Principle of Democracy, we must eliminate the corrupt officials and bureaucrats in various places, and the public officials who deceive those above and oppress those below, and realize the establishment of local councils as soon as possible, so that the general public can contribute more concrete opinions to the government's implementation of resisting the invaders' demands, so that the people's power of all ethnic groups, parties, and social strata in the country can be completely gathered into the mainstream of the government's resistance against the invaders; so that some forces will not be wasted; ××××××××. To seek the final victory of the national liberation war, establish a republic of the Three Principles of the People, and achieve the true realization of the Principle of Democracy.

Mr. Sun Yat-sen was a compassionate person who deeply hated those who used their power to oppress others. Therefore, from the research of the new political trends in the world, he put forward this Principle of People's Livelihood. He wanted to thoroughly realize this principle, so that everyone could obtain the status of being a human being, and everyone could obtain the living materials of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. But now the invaders want to destroy our Chinese nation, and want to degrade our status as human beings to the status of being cows and horses, to the status of slaves in the fifteenth century. We also recognize the true face of the invaders, ××××××××, ... Then, we, the comrades and compatriots who are conducting the commemoration of Mr. Sun Yat-sen today, should deeply understand the true meaning of Mr. Sun's revolutionary Three Principles of the People and the three major policies, and should not use personal prejudices to prevent implementation or lack the courage to fully implement them, ××××××, that would be tantamount to making our liberation war even more difficult. These are all symptoms of the War of Resistance against Japan, and we should loudly call for them to be corrected.

Finally, I have a few more words to say: The reason why the Republic of China was able to be established. From my point of view, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of continuous struggle is one of them. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, in this difficult revolutionary war of national liberation, Mr. Sun's spirit of struggle is worthy of everyone's earnest study. The establishment of the Republic of China, and the fact that the people of the whole country were able to be relieved of the suffering of imperial oppression, was due to the willingness of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the general revolutionary patriots to sacrifice their blood and make the determination to succeed or die for the cause. Therefore, it was possible to more widely arouse the enthusiasm of patriots throughout the country to respond and participate, this is the second point. ××××××, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, everyone should rise up with a sacrificial determination and participate in the work of saving the country ××××× to persevere in the war of resistance, to support the war of resistance to the end, and to strive for the final victory. Also, I remember that after the establishment of the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), many comrades were sent to various places to solicit donations. Overseas Chinese destroyed their homes and donated money, and this call was echoed from one another. Afterwards, the Republic of China was able to be established, and the strength of the overseas Chinese accounted for one-third of the total. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we should know even more the difficulties of creating the Republic of China. Overseas Chinese in various places, in particular, should remember the merits of responding to Mr. Sun's revolution by destroying their homes and donating money, and continue to donate money, so that this ×× war can receive more economic assistance. At the same time, overseas Chinese should also fully assist in the establishment of military industries and the development of national defense economy, so that the government can obtain all the resources to resist the ×× invaders. At the same time, whether they are officials or civilians, they should reflect on the accumulation of their own private property, whether there is a hint of making a fortune from the national crisis, everyone should ask their conscience, and now, with the devastation before our eyes, can we turn a blind eye to it? If the country is destroyed, even if there is private property, it is useless. The result of the Jewish people's self-interest is a good warning for us. Today, let us donate more money to the country, to help the refugees, and to the soldiers who have been wounded and returned from the front line. As we commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we must learn Mr. Sun's spirit of struggle, revolution, integrity, selflessness, and benevolence to complete the great cause of national liberation and establish an independent and free modern country.

### Czech Government Declares It Can Control the Overall Situation; Tiso and Tsukamazan Go to Germany for Help; Hitler Convenes a Meeting to Discuss

[Reuter's Berlin, 11th] It is reported that German leader Hitler convened his closest advisors at midnight yesterday for a meeting to discuss the Czech incident.

[Reuter's Prague, 10th] Some sources say that the German minority in Slovakia seems to be encouraging the Slovak extremist faction to break away from the Czech Federal Government, but Berlin does not seem to approve of these radicals. The visit to Germany by two recently dismissed Slovak ministers has failed. Former Slovak Prime Minister Tiso and other former ministers were escorted home by the police separately. The news of the arrest of the extremist leaders has been confirmed.

[Reuter's Basle, 10th] According to semi-official sources, former Slovak Minister Chankansky and German minority leader Tsukamazan arrived in Vienna together today. It is rumored that Tukansky's trip is to appeal to Hitler on behalf of the Slovak people, but the political circles have not heard of it. However, the general psychological perception is that Tukansky bears this mission to some extent. Although the official side has remained silent on the Slovak incident, the political circles and the Berlin newspapers seem to express full sympathy for the Slovak people.

[Reuter's Vienna, 10th] It is reported that Chankansky has left Austria for Berlin to meet Hitler. Before his departure, he broadcast a speech here, accusing the ministers of the new Slovak government of being traitors to the Slovak people, and declared that Czechia's intervention in Slovakia's internal affairs this time is constitutionally inappropriate.

[Reuter's Vienna, 10th] According to another report, Tukansky did not go to Berlin, but went to Bratislava.

[Reuter's Peking, 10th] It is reported that before going to Vienna, Mr. Tsukamazan, the leader of the German minority in the Slovak region, gave a speech in front of his office to 45,000 German demonstrators, saying, "Our German ethnic group, under the protection of the leader, should take joint action with the Slovak people to restore peace and order here." At the same time, it is also learned that Mr. Mauga, the director of the political department of the Linke Guard, who was wanted by the Czech government, recently declared that "The Czech government's actions are the greatest deception in the history of the Slovak people." He called for a joint effort with the German people to fight for a free Czechoslovakia.

Slovak Prime Minister Dismissed; Conflict Between Linke Guard and Czech Army in the Central District of Bratislava

[Reuter's Prague, 10th] The Czech government declares that the Slovak autonomous movement is under control. Deputy Prime Minister Schiferik, who had been ordered to go to Rome to attend the Pope's coronation ceremony, has also been recalled and appointed as Prime Minister to replace Mr. Tiso. It is heard that Tiso is protesting to Hitler about his dismissal by the Czech government. Some members of the disbanded Linke Guard have been placed under house arrest in the barracks, and others have been sent to Moravia. The Slovak capital of Bratislava had a small riot this morning, but it has now calmed down. However, heavy troops are still stationed at the railway station. The authorities strictly prohibit the publication of newspapers, and the military officers prohibit people from listening to foreign broadcasts. The conflict between Slovakia and Czechia cannot be said to have been resolved.

[Reuter's Prague, 10th] Bratislava Radio Station said that the newly established provisional government has been overthrown, and the Czech military police have also withdrawn. Czech Deputy Prime Minister broadcast a speech saying that the turmoil between Slovakia and Czechia will be resolved within 24 hours.

[Reuter's Budapest, 10th] According to news from Bratislava, Slovakia will ask Hitler to represent them and intervene with the Czech government. The reason for the sudden aggravation of this matter is that Slovak extremists were found to be plotting to declare the Independent State of Slovakia and secede from Czechia. Germany occupies a major position in all the changes in Czechia. At the very least, the Czech government would never take strong steps to dismiss the Slovak Prime Minister without the prior consent of Germany. After this conflict, it will be difficult for the Czech and Slovak governments to cooperate again. It is also reported that the Linke Guard's attempt to overthrow the local government and establish a military dictatorship has failed since the mechanized infantry entered Bratislava this morning.

[Reuter's Latakia, 10th] Martial law is only implemented in the Pastern area and does not involve Bratislava. Before Vice President Sidor went to Bratislava, he declared that the power to decide on the Slovak issue should be in Bratislava and not in Prague.

[Haitong News Agency Bratislava, 11th] Yesterday afternoon, near the office of the Labor Federation in the central district of this city, the Linke Guard clashed with the Czech army. One member of the Linke Guard died and three were injured. The demonstration here has now increased even more. The situation in various parts of Slovakia is also very tense.

[Associated Press Bratislava, 10th] At 11:00 a.m. today, martial law was implemented everywhere, and the army began to occupy public buildings in Bratislava, Piestany, and Trencin. At the same time, the Czech government has appointed a Czech soldier to assist and instruct the Slovak government. This morning, thousands of Linke Guards and workers gathered in front of the government buildings to demonstrate and protest against the dismissal of the Prime Minister. Several shots were fired immediately. Nationalist workers from major Slovak factories, including the wire, rubber, and gunpowder industries, announced a strike and participated in the Slovak patriotic youth group's demonstration in Bratislava. The military authorities immediately took precautions to prevent workers and farmers in the countryside from getting involved in the strike. Most of the troops were brought from non-Slovak regions in trucks and cars this morning. Troops are also on their way here from Bohemia and Moravia. Telephone lines in this city and the outside world have been cut off. They were restored at 9:00 a.m.

[Associated Press Prague, 10th] Disturbances broke out in the Slovak region today. The Linke Guard clashed with the police, injuring two people. The police immediately restored order. By the afternoon, everything had calmed down. A large group of Linke supporters and rebellious workers gathered in front of the government buildings, shouting, "We demand a free and independent Czechoslovakia," "Slovak Hitler," referring to Hitler. After the Munich Conference, Czechia became chaotic. The dismissal of Slovak Prime Minister Tiso this time is a resolute method to restore Czech national independence and integrity. At 12:30 p.m., Finance Minister Tauberansky began to be responsible for ruling the Slovak government, pending Schiferik's return, and gave a broadcast speech, urging the people to maintain order.

[Associated Press Bratislava, 11th] Slovak Government Vice President Sidor, who was arrested yesterday, was released in the evening. He gave a speech to the crowd on the terrace of the Carlton Hotel. He is now participating in discussions to organize a constructive government to replace the current one, and said that he is prepared to work hard to find a compromise solution with the nationalist faction. By night, the situation here had calmed down. At 9:00 p.m., the martial law was lifted.

[Associated Press Vienna, 11th] Radio broadcasts said that disturbances had occurred south of Kveta, near Peterwhist, and troops were needed to go to suppress them. At the same time, according to unconfirmed reports, German troops had crossed the Danube River bridge and invaded Bratislava in large numbers. However, the Berlin Propaganda Department has strongly denied this.

French Political Circles Maintain Conservative Silence

British Experts Believe Czech Coup Is Not a Purely Natural Movement of the People

[Haitong News Agency Paris, 11th] Political circles maintain conservative silence on the coup in Czechia, and newspapers have not criticized it. Political circles particularly pointed out that France's attention to Czechia has been greatly reduced since the Munich Conference. The military agreement between France and Czechia no longer exists. The French government has notified Germany that it is not interested in the political situation in Czechia.

[Reuter's London, 11th] A diplomatic observer here said, "The Slovak coup against the Czech government, which failed, is enough to show that the Czech issue has not been completely resolved since the Munich Conference. European politicians are very troubled by the inside story of the coup. Experts in general do not believe that this move is a purely natural movement of the people. There are many Slovaks who are unwilling to unite with Czechia, and it cannot be denied that they have expressed dissatisfaction with the Czech government on a daily basis. Although the German newspapers condemned Czech President Hodelcher's resolute steps to suppress the rebellion, Germany may not necessarily support the rebellion. It is noteworthy that the dismissed Slovak Prime Minister Tiso, representing the Slovak independence movement, asked the German government for assistance. The world is now waiting for Germany's reply. Although Slovakia has recently shown that it is not as dependent on Germany as it used to be, it is difficult to predict what benefits Germany hopes to obtain after it secedes from Czechia. The resolution of the Slovak movement may have considerable links with the fate of Little Russia, which has not yet been decided."

### British Government Makes Efforts to Adjust the European Situation; End of Spanish War Will Be a Prerequisite; Conference to Limit Armaments May Be Convened

[Reuter's London, 10th] Political visitors here are unanimously optimistic about the overall European situation this morning. All evening newspapers have published articles commenting on the possibility of convening a conference to limit armaments. The "Reuter's" diplomatic visitor declared that it is the general intention of London that the Spanish War can no longer be prolonged and will be an important prerequisite for adjusting the overall European situation. The past tense atmosphere may be a lesson for France and Italy, so that the relationship between the two sides can be adjusted as soon as possible. The British government is still working hard, hoping to carry out the entire movement to limit armaments. At the same time, London does not express importance to the news that Italy has informally made requests to France. The general public agrees with the visitor's view that the talks between France and Italy may focus on the treatment of Italian expatriates in Gibraltar and Tunisia. However, it is believed that there will be no particular difficulties in the talks between the two countries.

### Italy Sends Diplomatic Note to France, Briefly Outlining Its Demands

[Associated Press London, 10th] According to reliable diplomatic sources, Italy will send a diplomatic note to France in the middle of this week, briefly outlining its demands regarding Gibraltar, the Addis Ababa Railway, and Tunisia. It is said that the diplomatic note is much more moderate than the clamor of the Italian newspapers. This has gradually made the general public believe that Chamberlain's attempt to convene a world conference on the limitation of armaments before autumn of this year is indeed possible. It is said that Chamberlain will first discuss the limitation of air force with European countries, and then invite the United States and other countries to participate in the discussion. In addition to the limitation of all armaments, economic issues and the German colonial issue will also be included to ease the general situation. At present, Britain and France have gradually revealed an optimistic atmosphere, because it is generally believed that the end of the Spanish War, as stated by Chamberlain, can improve the general situation. According to recent news from Rome and Paris, the officials of the two countries have denied the above-mentioned rumors about Italy sending a diplomatic note to France.

### Britain and Italy Will Re-Discuss the Mediterranean Issue

[Associated Press Paris, 10th] The prerequisite for the future diplomatic activities in Europe will be the resolution of the Spanish situation. Once General Franco occupies Madrid, Chamberlain will seize the opportunity to re-discuss the situation in the Mediterranean with Mussolini. This was originally planned during Chamberlain's visit to Italy. The signs of this development have long been revealed. First of all, the issue of Italian volunteers in Spain must be resolved. It is to adjust the Franco-Italian disputes to ease the tension in Europe for months. In fact, France may see Mussolini obtain some satisfaction in Tunisia, Gibraltar, the Addis Ababa Railway, and the Suez Canal, but everything will not happen automatically until Mussolini makes a formal request. It has been suggested that the Franco-Italian talks can be divided into two parts. The first part does not discuss land claims, and the second part does discuss land claims. This is obviously not agreed to by France. If Mussolini's attitude is slightly more moderate, Chamberlain's plan to limit armaments may succeed.

[Reuter's Rosherville, 10th] A battalion of Senegalese troops left here for Marseille tonight, and will transfer to Gibraltar from there.

### Palestine Conference: British and Arab Representatives Meet for Talks

[Reuters, London, 11th] Reuters has learned from authoritative sources that the Jewish delegation to the Palestine Conference will meet with British representatives this afternoon. At that time, the British side will respond to the draft proposal previously submitted by the administrative department of the Jewish Congress. It is generally believed that whether the Jews will terminate or continue discussions with the British side will depend on the nature of the response.

[Reuters, London, 10th] According to a Reuters reporter, the Jewish delegation delivered a notice to the British government today, stating that the Jewish representatives cannot accept an independent Palestine dominated by Arabs. It further stated that any proposal that does not guarantee the growth of the Jewish national homeland will not be considered by the Jewish representatives as a basis for continued discussion. However, Jewish figures are quite concerned that the British government's final recommendations will not differ much from the proposal made a year ago.

### Germany's Annexation of Austria: First Anniversary Tomorrow; Hitler to Attend Celebrations; Schuschnigg Still Not Released

[Reuters, Berlin, 10th] Hitler will travel to Austria on the 13th of this month to attend the celebrations commemorating the first anniversary of the German-Austrian merger.

[Reuters, Vienna, 10th] In commemoration of the anniversary of the German-Austrian merger, an amnesty has been granted, and 300 political prisoners of Aryan descent were released today. However, former Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and former Mayor Kermis are not among them, and no Jews have been invited for release.

### Schacht Embarks on a Journey, with Brief Stays in Italy and Egypt, and Plans to Visit India at the End of the Month

[Reuters, Berlin, 10th] It is reported that Dr. Schacht, the former president of the German National Bank, will embark on a journey tomorrow. Schacht's trip will not directly go to India; he will make brief stops in Italy and Egypt along the way and will go to India around the end of the month. It is also rumored that he will later travel to Australia.

### British Far East Shipping Plummets Under Japanese Threat; Imperial Shipping Committee Demands Competition

[Reuters, London, 10th] The report of the British Imperial Shipping Committee mentions the threat of Japanese merchant ships to British shipping in the East, stating that Japan's eastern trade transport volume through the Panama Canal has increased by about two-fifths, while Britain's has decreased from one-third to two-fifths, and the United States' has decreased from one-third to one-eighth. The reason for the increase in Japanese merchant ships is the increase in business between Japan, and the special measures taken by the Japanese government to support Japanese merchant ships. According to statistics from 1936, the operating expenses of Japanese ships were about 10% to 15% less than those of British ships. The report continues to call on British ships to improve their equipment so that they can compete with foreign ships for passengers and to make major adjustments in management, strengthening Eastern agencies, which is one of the key factors. "This move is greatly related to naval and economic defense in both wartime and peacetime. Without merchant shipping, what would be the use of the army and air force stationed in Singapore? Whether the future of British commerce and banking interests in the Far East is promising still depends on whether British ships have the capacity to expand British commerce to the East."

### Manchester Bombing Case: Trial Concluded; Five Men and One Woman Convicted

[Reuters, London, 10th] The trial of the recent bombing case in Manchester, England, has concluded. Those convicted include five men and one woman. Campbell, the ringleader, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Mary Green (female) was sentenced to seven years in prison. The other four men, namely Connell, Duggan, Green, and Gavahan, were each sentenced to 20 years in prison. One person was acquitted. When the ringleader Campbell was convicted, he said, "Excellent, I am being punished for a noble cause. I will come back. May God save Ireland." After Mary was convicted, she shouted loudly, "May God save Ireland!" The prison guard immediately covered her mouth with his hand and took her away. Gavahan also shouted, "May God save Ireland!" Duggan then shouted "The Republic rises!"

### "Maintain Peace, Develop Commerce": Stalin Elucidates Foreign Policy, Ridicules the Ineffectiveness of the Anti-Comintern Pact

[Associated Press, Moscow, 11th] In his speech at the 18th Congress of the Soviet Union, Stalin quoted former US President Roosevelt's saying "Speak softly and carry a big stick" to elucidate his peace policy, saying that the Soviet Union is willing to engage in commercial exchanges with all countries that do not harm the interests of the Soviet Union, and warns those who criticize the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union has a strong army, navy, and air force. He also ridiculed the ineffectiveness of the Anti-Comintern Pact and declared that the handling of aggressor nations by Britain and France has failed. It is inappropriate for British, French, and North American newspapers to provoke disputes between Germany and the Soviet Union over Ukraine. In short, the Soviet Union's foreign policy is as follows: (1) Maintain peace and develop commerce with all countries; (2) Suppress actions that provoke war; (3) Strengthen the Soviet Union's military power; (4) Promote friendship between the Soviet Union and all peaceful countries.

### British Ships in the Mediterranean Ordered to Protect Merchant Ships; Immediate Retaliation If Fired Upon; Rebel Party in Madrid About to be Heavily Besieged

[Haitong News Agency, London, 11th] According to the "Evening News" report, the British warships stationed in the Mediterranean have received instructions that if any Spanish warship sinks a British merchant ship inside or outside Spanish territorial waters, the British warship can open fire without prior notice. Also, the number of British ships patrolling the Mediterranean has recently increased.

[Reuters, Mankos, 10th] The Madrid Defense Committee broadcast a message this afternoon, stating that most of the areas occupied by the Communist Party in the central district of Madrid have been recaptured by troops under the jurisdiction of the Defense Committee.

[Reuters, Madrid, 10th] The Communist army in the eastern district of the city engaged in fierce fighting with the mechanized motorcade led by General Michaya in the city's eastern square. Both sides used tanks. General Michaya admitted that he had occupied the square. Troops under the jurisdiction of the Defense Committee are now opening up pillars from the city center to help fight there. The rebel army is in danger of being heavily besieged.

[Reuters, San Jorde Rio, 10th] It is reported that General Michaya's troops have recovered the Navy Department, the Telephone Bureau (a 17-story building, Madrid's skyscraper) and other important buildings held by the Communist army.

### US and Mexico Agree to Conclude an Agreement to Resolve Oil Industry Disputes

[Reuters, Mexico City, 11th] Official announcement: The President of Mexico and the US oil industry representative in Mexico, Leach Peter, have agreed to conclude an agreement to resolve the oil industry disputes. However, the content of the agreement has not yet been disclosed.

### Representatives of Britain, Australia, and New Zealand to Hold Pacific Conference to Discuss Far East Autonomous Territory Defense; Hoare's Speech: Britain Will Surely Win the War

[Associated Press, London, 10th] British Home Secretary Hoare delivered a speech today, saying, "Britain cannot be defeated in one fell swoop by the enemy in a short-term war, but in a long-term war, our inexhaustible resources will guarantee our final victory," and so on.

[Central News Agency, London, 10th] Well-informed sources here recently announced that the British government, in order to hold a Pacific conference in the Far East with representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia and New Zealand within a short period of time, the agenda includes (1) the sea, land, and air defense of the British autonomous territories in the Pacific; (2) the opening of civil aviation routes; (3) the issue of army officer training. The British government will be represented by representatives of the army, navy, and air force, among whom Army Representative General Squire and Navy Representative Rear Admiral Colvin have arrived in the Commonwealth of Australia. The Commonwealth of Canada, because it can supply the autonomous territories in the Pacific with aircraft coaches in the future, just like it supplies the British headquarters, may also send personnel to participate in the conference.

Small Commentary

### All-England Aid China Congress

The All-England Aid China Congress began in London on the evening of the 10th and the situation was unusually enthusiastic. We believe that the following are particularly noteworthy:

First, the Bishop of York addressed the conference and expressed great respect for the heroic struggle of the Chinese people against Japan. This shows that our country's perseverance in the war of resistance not only enhances our country's international status, but also makes the international community realize that our country's war of resistance is also to defend world peace, increasing international sympathy and assistance.

Second, the Bishop of York also loudly pointed out: "The organized great powers have not yet been able to find a way to end their suffering, and I am ashamed of it." This is obviously a sad question aimed at compromise diplomacy. However, we want to solemnly inform the world that while we deeply appreciate the noble intentions of the international community to end our suffering, there is no other way to follow other than to impose effective sanctions on the aggressors and murderers!

Third, Miss. Philip, the chairman of the conference, specifically pointed out the serious threat to the lives of the British people from the aggressors in the Far East attacking China. She also said: "If Japan wins, one-fifth of humanity will become semi-slaves!" This is a warning. It is by no means alarmist, which shows that the British people are gradually awakening!

The international community is staging a great people's movement, which has been and is expanding the aid China movement, in order to fulfill everyone's responsibility in humanity and justice. How should our compatriots across the country, especially overseas Chinese who are spared from the disaster of artillery fire, restrain all unnecessary consumption and dedicate all their strength to saving the suffering of the motherland!

### US Credit Loan to Chile, Under Discussion in Economic Circles to Avoid Signing Trade Agreement with Germany

[Reuters, New York, 10th] According to the Commercial Daily, after the signing of the agreement between the United States and Brazil, economic circles are discussing granting a credit loan to Chile. It is said that this loan can prevent Chile from signing a new trade agreement with Germany. It is also learned that because Chile abandoned its five-year plan to defer foreign debts, this loan can be carried out quickly.

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] Deputy Secretary of State Welles recently discussed the US-Brazil economic cooperation determination, saying that the United States has not discussed other matters with other Latin American countries.

### Nazi Tyranny on the Rise

— Translated by Shichang, original author Harold Callender, published in the February issue of "Modern Historical Materials"

In Germany, it is very difficult for people to hear criticism of politics, because they are all forced to defend Hitler and cannot express the slightest dissatisfaction. Everywhere, the secret police are loyal to their duties, eavesdropping on telephones, opening letters, and closely monitoring suspicious people. The people of Germany know that these official secret agents are everywhere, so they avoid using telephones except for trivial calls, in order to avoid all kinds of troubles. However, they know very well the path that Germany is taking now, and they repeatedly express their hope that foreign countries can suppress the Nazi "explosion."

Nazi Germany has been vigorously strengthening its power and severely criticizing Britain and the United States; however, domestic unrest and fear are revealed everywhere. Foreign countries are also gradually disbelieving Germany's self-praise. At present, Germany believes that it can suppress domestic dissatisfaction; it is not necessary to worry about foreign opposition for the time being.

I recently visited Germany and traveled through ten major cities in the southwest and northeast. I gained some impressions: people in various parts of Germany, even those in the Nazi class, expressed shock, dissatisfaction, and shame at the November riots (referring to the anti-Jewish movement—translator) and the things done in the name of the German people. They deeply hate the official claim that anti-Jewish behavior is a natural move of German public opinion. At the same time, seeing the evolution of recent events, they are alarmed about the future of Germany. They hope that foreign countries will adopt a tougher attitude towards Germany. They know that they are powerless, because the power of the Nazis is too violent. If they are dissatisfied, there is no doubt that they will be imprisoned.

The German people unanimously hate war. At the same time, they believe that if Germany participates in a war, it will definitely be very short, because the German people do not want war, and the Nazi rule may be reduced because of the war. Therefore, Hitler's greatest success is winning without fighting and achieving his desired goals without fighting. In this way, Germany's national strength is increasing day by day. The German people, not Nazi officials, even those who deeply hate domestic tyranny, also feel happy, because this is a victory achieved without war. However, the dangers of Nazi foreign policy cannot be ignored, and many of these dangers have already been realized.

Catholics are forced to stop children from attending Catholic schools; the salaries of Protestant pastors have also been greatly reduced by the authorities, and they are even prepared to refuse to pay them; church property and houses will be confiscated; church taxes will continue to be levied and used for non-religious businesses; church pastors will be in danger of being arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit revolution. Catholicism is being heavily attacked by the Nazis.

What annoys the Germans the most is the lack of food. Most of them are unwilling to sacrifice butter to build cannons. Each person can only eat a quarter of a pound of butter per week. Eggs are extremely rare. Better quality food is not available; bread seems to be whiter than a year ago, but, according to knowledgeable housewives, the ingredients are even worse. People in various parts of Germany are complaining about unreasonable taxes and forced donations.

In order to expand its military, Germany is tightening its belt in all aspects. Especially for kitchens and dining rooms, there is a great impact. In Germany's big hotels and restaurants, the food that Germans can get is not as good as what a restaurant in a small republic with a weaker military can supply. However, they clearly know that the country stores a variety of rich foods. The German's appetite is also not free. Germany treats foreigners differently. Foreigners in German large hotels can have a quarter of a pound of butter every day - the amount that Germans can get every week - a kind foreigner will definitely invite his German friends to dine with him in the room, and at the same time, after the meal, tie up the butter with an oilcloth and put it in his friend's pocket, in this way, he will surely receive a great welcome!

Germany is also very short of fresh fruits. Although the stored fruits can meet the needs of foreign travelers, women who know these things say that many fruits are mixed with loaded guns to save the continuous shortage, so there are not many fresh fruits.

If a foreigner runs out of a comfortable German hotel and sets up a family by himself, he will definitely have food problems and will not be able to get delicious and nourishing food. Housewives all complain about the lack of butter, eggs, fresh leaves, vegetables, wheat, flour, sugar, etc. Working-class women feel that food is more expensive, and they dare not ask about meat.

Do Germans like this kind of life? Of course not; however, it doesn't matter much, Germans simply cannot manage Germany!

### 14th Anniversary of the Premier's Death: All Sectors of Hong Kong to Solemnly Commemorate Today; Commemorative Meeting to be Held at the Queen's Theatre at 10:30 AM; He Xiangning to Serve as Chairman and Sell Commemorative Badges to Raise Funds for Disaster Relief

Today is the 14th anniversary of the death of the Premier. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong have held solemn commemorations every year on this day to express their condolences. It is now scheduled to hold a meeting at the Queen's Theatre at 10:30 am today, with Ms. He Xiangning serving as the chairman of the meeting, and Mr. Ye Gongchuo, Chuan Bingchang, Luo Yiqun, and other revolutionary pioneers who stayed in Hong Kong will be invited to speak about the Premier's life and deeds. At the same time, commemorative badges will be sold to raise funds for disaster relief. Li Xiangen, an old comrade of the Kuomintang, wrote two poems yesterday to commemorate the 14th anniversary of the Premier's death. The poem says, "It is difficult to forget the time of being given arrows; ten years have passed, one remains. I regret chasing the poor thieves in the report; it is futile to fight the ugly barbarians. The heart of the country is seen by the world; how can the tears of Chequan be the private tears of party members? The survival of the motherland is now like a thread; the awe-inspiring spirit has knowledge. It has been said since ancient times that hardship builds a nation, but I am deeply saddened that this is unprecedented; the wars are raging for thousands of miles, and the wind and rain are bleak for fourteen years. The legacy is still in my ears, and I only think of remembering the whip clearly. Strive for peace to save China, dare to tell the people not to disgrace their ancestors." The order of today's commemorative meeting of all sectors is as follows: (1) All stand at attention; (2) Sing the national anthem; (3) Bow three times to the party and national flag and Sun Premier's portrait; (4) The chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will; (5) Observe a three-minute silence for the national martyrs and the compatriots who died in the disaster; (6) The chairman delivers the opening speech; (7) The chairman reports the brief history of Sun Premier's life; (8) Speech; (9) Lecture; (10) Ceremony ends; (11) Meeting adjourns.

### Murder Case Occurs on Peel Street: Worker from the South China Morning Post Stabbed and Seriously Injured; British Soldiers and Chinese Involved in a Major Brawl in Wan Chai Yesterday Morning

Mai Wang, a 30-year-old compositor at the South China Morning Post, lived at No. 32 Peel Street, ground floor. At 1:20 am yesterday morning, Mai finished work and returned home. When he turned from City God Street onto Peel Street, he was suddenly approached by a thug armed with a sharp knife who lunged out of the darkness and stabbed Mai repeatedly in the back without saying a word. Mai turned around to resist and was stabbed in the right hand. Blood flowed profusely, and he fell to the ground with serious injuries. The assailant, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, fled the scene. Later, a passerby discovered this, called the police station to report the case. After receiving the report, the police sent a large number of detectives to the scene to investigate, sent the injured to Mary Hospital for treatment, and strictly pursued the murderer in the case. Also, at about midnight yesterday morning, a brawl occurred in front of the Navy and Army Club in Wan Chai. The incident was caused by a British sailor who was passing by in a rickshaw, claiming that a Chinese person threw a stone at him. He quickly got out of the car to negotiate and was attacked by another Chinese person. At that time, the sailors on the roadside joined the brawl one after another, and a melee broke out. Residents nearby did not know what was happening and suspected it was a robbery, so they whistled to call the police, and by the time an Indian policeman arrived, the brawlers had dispersed. It is reported that as a result, one Chinese person was beaten severely injured and later sent to the hospital for treatment.

### Hong Kong Authorities Pay Special Attention to the Development of Tour Guide Agencies; Magistrate Describes Them as a Disguised Form of Prostitution

The Hong Kong authorities have recently paid special attention to the tour guide agencies in Hong Kong. A certain magistrate once criticized the nature of tour guide agencies, saying that they are "nothing more than a disguised form of prostitution." The number of tour guide agencies established in Hong Kong is extremely booming. There are already 35 well-known ones, employing a total of more than 400 tour guides, and more than 100 unemployed women seek jobs at tour guide agencies every day. Most of these people are refugees from Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shantou, and Xiamen who have fallen into Hong Kong, and some even come from mainland China. After arriving in Hong Kong, because the cost of living in Hong Kong is too high, and it is not easy to find a job, it is not easy to maintain a living, so they are forced to seek a way out in this. Many also change careers to become tour guides to make a living. The existence of tour guides in Hong Kong actually began with Japanese hostesses. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, Chinese tour guide agencies have been established to replace them. Previously, Japanese people often invited hostesses to meetings to help, or to chat and drink, or to sing to entertain, nominally selling sex but not the body. Since the outbreak of the war, most of these hostesses have been recalled to their country to comfort the "Imperial Army." The former Japanese hostesses charged two yuan per hour for being invited to serve guests, which is more than double the current tour guides.

### Strict Attention to Crack Down on Counterfeit National Products: Overseas Chinese in the Philippines; Strict Attention: Ship Goods in Hong Kong and Shanghai, Inspect Bills of Lading, Severe Penalties for Violators; One Dollar Debt Repayment Campaign Achieves Good Results

A certain small Luzon in this sea recently received a flying mail from the Luzon Commercial Bank, stating that the Philippine Overseas Chinese Aid Committee is paying attention to the purchase of goods from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou and other places in order to crack down on counterfeit national products, and has formulated regulations. All commercial firms purchasing goods domestically must have the bill of lading inspected by the Executive Committee of the Committee, and report to the Committee for inspection when the goods arrive before they can be loaded. If a commercial firm has ordered goods from Hong Kong, Shanghai, Zhangzhou, or Quanzhou in the past and does not follow the regulations, the bill of lading will be submitted to the Committee for reporting and inspection, and if there is evidence of a violation, a fine of 100 Philippine pesos will be imposed.

Recently discovered that it is counterfeit

And from March 1, if the domestic goods received by each commercial firm are not submitted and reported for inspection, the first time will be fined half of the value of the goods, and the second time will be fined the full value of the goods. The Philippine Overseas Chinese Aid Committee has formulated this regulation because it has recently discovered that many of the so-called national products are counterfeit. Now, special and severe steps have been taken, hoping that it will not be seen again in the future.

One Dollar Debt Repayment Far Exceeds Hong Kong

Also, according to an air express from a friend in the Philippines, the Philippines' response to the one dollar debt repayment movement was later than Hong Kong's, but the results achieved now far exceed those of Hong Kong. It is estimated that from January 5 to February 5, 100,000 yuan of national currency was raised. Recently, another 100,000 yuan was raised, totaling 200,000 yuan. There are only 120,000-130,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, and now 200,000 yuan has been obtained, with an average donation of more than one yuan per person. Hong Kong has more than one million compatriots, and the results are only 320,000 yuan, which is somewhat disappointing. I hope the compatriots in Hong Kong will pay attention to it.

### Air Defense Exhibition Closes This Afternoon: Viewers Must Go This Morning

The air defense exhibition held on the second floor of the Peninsula Hotel has attracted a large number of visitors since its opening. Yesterday, the exhibition was open from 10:00 am to 7:00 pm, and there were still many Chinese and foreign viewers. The meeting has been scheduled to close at 12:00 noon today. Those who wish to visit, do not miss this opportunity.

### Kowloon Rickshaw Industry: Owners to Directly Manage Carts Starting Next Month, Reducing Exploitation of Rickshaw Pullers by Agents

Currently, there are a total of 350 rickshaws operating in Kowloon. Initially, the Police Traffic Department instructed each owner to collect a daily rental fee not exceeding 50 cents. The owners complied, but later found the management cumbersome and transferred the rickshaws to agents. The owners charged the agents 45 cents per day, but the agents, after acquiring a large number of rickshaws, increased the rent to rickshaw pullers from 60-odd cents to 84 cents per day. The pullers, burdened by the excessive cost, requested the agents to lower the rent, but were refused. Consequently, the pullers appealed to the owners, the Police Traffic Department, and the Chinese community for intervention. The Police Traffic Department has now ordered all owners to cease delegating management to agents from April 1st of this year and to manage the rickshaws themselves.

### Severe Rice Shortage in Guangdong: Chinese Chamber of Commerce Cables Kong Xiangxi, Requesting Tax Exemption for Imported Rice; Famine Feared in Siyi and Zhongshan

The food panic in Guangdong province has reached a severe stage. Simultaneously, there is extensive searching and purchasing in Siyi and Zhongshan areas, and transporting for export, the degree of panic is even worse than before. The Siyi Overseas Chinese Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly telegraphed Kong Xiangxi, the Minister of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, requesting him to find ways to maintain supply. The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce also telegraphed Kong yesterday, requesting a temporary tax exemption for imported rice to maintain food for the people. The original telegram reads: "To Minister Kong Xiangxi of the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing, the rice shortage in Guangdong is severe, upon which the people depend for food, famine is imminent. We earnestly request that you immediately issue a clear order to temporarily exempt import duties on foreign rice to avert the crisis. The country will be fortunate. Li Xingwei, Chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, respectfully bows. (Seal)." Furthermore, the Hong Kong artillery authorities issued a report yesterday stating that the West Fort on Stonecutters Island is scheduled to conduct live-fire exercises from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM on March 16th. If the exercise cannot be held on that day due to unforeseen circumstances, it will be rescheduled to the following day. In addition, the Jubilee Battery is scheduled to conduct exercises on March 16th. If the exercise cannot be held on that day due to unforeseen circumstances, it will be rescheduled to March 17th. The exercise area is within zones D and E. All vessels, large and small, passing through the exercise area during the exercises at the aforementioned forts are advised to exercise caution to avoid accidents.

### Hong Kong News in Brief

### The Grain Shortage in Zhongshan

— Luoxia

This newspaper's special feature on Zhongshan County states that it is a place of abundant grain, which, in addition to supplying the county itself, can also alleviate shortages in neighboring counties. Generally speaking, Zhongshan County should not experience a grain shortage. However, it is now facing a grain shortage crisis, which is a matter of great concern.

Following the fall of Guangzhou and the siege of Humen, Zhongshan County found itself in a precarious situation. To prepare for the impending crisis, the local government took all necessary defensive measures, including the dispersal of grain. Moreover, this occurred during the late rice harvest. The sudden shock of this unexpected event caused farmers to rush to sell their harvested grain. Rice shops and merchants naturally dared not store large quantities. In this situation of oversupply, Zhongshan's rice was extremely cheap, selling for only six dollars per hundred dan. Neighboring towns and counties came to purchase it. It was at this time that it was discovered that certain rice companies were absorbing and transporting these cheap grains to the interior. According to the regulations promulgated by the authorities to promote domestic rice to stop the loopholes, this was an unreasonable and illegal act. However, they were able to use their influence to ensure that domestic rice flowed out smoothly. "Preserving grain, avoiding × food" was a grand and clever excuse!

The × invaders of Guangzhou seemed to be feeling the pinch and had no strength to peer at other places. Zhongshan County gradually stabilized in this situation. After the early winter, it was spring again. The small amount of grain remaining in Zhongshan County after the major dispersal gradually dwindled, and the rice supply became short. The rice price naturally soared, from seven catties of rice for one dollar to five catties, and it is still trending upwards. The situation in neighboring towns and counties is even more dire. Ordinary middle and lower-class families are constantly complaining. In fact, many have not tasted the taste of rice for a long time, relying only on thin coarse grains to survive. The miserable situation is beyond description. If this continues, the entire Zhongshan County will be without grain in a month!

In response to this serious situation, the Zhongshan County Wartime Food Committee, after careful deliberation, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting exemption from import duties on foreign rice. On the other hand, it dispatched five committee members, including Li Delian and He Xijiong, to Hong Kong to appeal to the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, requesting the Zhongshan Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce to allocate the savings from the Charity Granary and the deposits from the Relief Society to purchase foreign rice for shipment to Zhongshan, to hold down prices and maintain the people's livelihood. These committee members have now arrived in Hong Kong and have contacted the persons in charge of the Zhongshan Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce. A meeting will be convened, approximately on Monday, to make a final decision on this matter.

At the same time, Gu Dinghua, the First District Administrative Commissioner, also convened the county magistrates of nine counties to discuss solutions to this problem. It was generally decided to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to exempt foreign rice from import duties and to order each township and county to find ways to manage price controls themselves. This is certainly an emergency measure. It is hoped that fellow countrymen in Hong Kong can provide strong assistance to this serious event!

### Exhibition of Famous Scenery in Occupied Areas

— Qizhuo

Touched by the scenery of the occupied areas, aspiring to recover the homeland!

"The carved jade steps should still be there, but the fair faces have changed." When we stepped into the exhibition of famous scenery in the occupied areas, those precious past events suddenly rushed into the realm of memory... But we have no tears, nor sadness, only gritted teeth and clenched fists.

The Exhibition of Famous Scenery in Occupied Areas, organized by the Hong Kong Women's War Relief Association, is being held at St. John's Cathedral on Garden Road for three consecutive days starting yesterday. Those who flock to visit know that they are not here to appreciate works of art, but to commemorate the traces of blood and tears. Singing "Songs of Exile" in a depressed and dejected manner is the cry of the weak. Only by standing tall and fighting back home is there a way out!

The exhibition features 491 frames, a dazzling array, all meticulous masterpieces by Mr. Tiege. The occupied areas photographed include Beijing, the Great Wall outside the pass, Tianjin, Jinan, Mount Tai, Qufu, Nanjing, Xixia, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.

The ancient architecture of the old capital fully symbolizes the height and beauty of our five thousand years of national culture. Although Eastern civilization is encountering misfortune and is temporarily obscured by shadows, one day it will regain its brilliance.

In Tianjin, we see our simple compatriots pulling boats and working in shoes and socks. This is the most bizarre thing for southerners to see. The "layered" clothing, like paper covering the windows and cotton curtains covering the doors, everywhere reveals the northern flavor of "sesame cakes and fried dough sticks"! The flocks of sheep and camels have also temporarily changed owners!

Mount Tai and Qufu on the Jinpu Railway... remind people of peaches, watermelons, pears... and make them drool a little. One day, we will relive the old dreams.

Nanjing, our great capital, we will never forget. The "soul" of the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen has long followed the new capital to Chongqing. Today, we pay our highest tribute.

The famous scenery of Suzhou and Hangzhou all the more sets off the magnificence and loveliness of our mountains and rivers. Mentioning Shanghai and Guangzhou is even more the old home that the vast number of compatriots in Hong Kong constantly think of! There is no need to be sad, the facts tell us: what exactly did the × people get from us? Although the cities of points and lines have fallen, the souls of the land are protected by heroic guerrillas. Its future rebirth, brilliant future, is entrusted to the determination of the whole country to fight against the enemy and the national policy of protracted resistance. This is a necessary curve in history, giving our old country the necessary training! After visiting the exhibition, we will never waver in our self-confidence, mistaking this as the success of the × people; but rather feel the loveliness of the mountains and rivers, the greatness of the motherland. Thank you × people for revealing the face of ×××××, so that we can recover and rise up in suffering!

According to what Mr. He Tiehua told reporters: These films were taken by him during his travels when he was editing the Pictorial in Shanghai two or three years ago. Recently, he will personally go to the front line to photograph war zone films, so as to rush to participate in this year's exhibition held in New York in June, paying attention to the contrast between before and after the war, especially films about our heroic resistance. Let foreign countries more clearly understand × people's ××. Mr. He has a correct understanding of photography, that is, he opposes photography as a pleasure item for the idle class, and focuses on the introduction of systematic geography and folk customs. It is heard that from March 17th to 19th, an exhibition will also be held at South China Middle School, and it is planned to use the income as disaster relief for refugees.

It is right to use "photography" as a tool for promoting the war of resistance and building the country; at the end of the article, I would like to express my infinite hopes to Mr. He and photography enthusiasts!

### Concerned About the Lives of Refugees: Hong Kong Governor Inspects Various Refugee Camps; Many Women and Children Still Live in the Open; Authorities Plan to Build Camps to Accommodate Them; New Camp to Be Built Near Ma Tau Chung to Relocate Various Chinese Troops

Since the outbreak of the Chinese war, more than ten thousand refugees from the war zones adjacent to the New Territories of the East River have fled into the territory. The Hong Kong government authorities, in addition to opening refugee camps in various districts of Kam Tin and Fanling to accommodate them as much as possible, have also built refugee houses in North Point, King's Park, and Ma Tau Chung for refugees from the original Japanese port, so that the refugees entering the territory will not live in the wilderness and become displaced. Sir Geoffrey Northcote, the Governor of Hong Kong, is very concerned about the daily lives of the refugees. Last week, he accompanied the Director of Medical and Health Services, Dr. Sze-to Wing-keuk, on a trip to the New Territories to inspect refugee camps and refugee areas. Every time he arrived at a refugee camp, he would summon the camp administrators to inquire in detail about the camp's equipment and provide detailed instructions.

Planning to Build Two New Camps

Accommodating Women, Children, and Chinese Troops

According to a reporter's investigation, the refugee camps in Hong Kong have already accommodated thousands of refugees, but there are still many women and children living on the streets, without shelter, in a very miserable state. It is reported that the government authorities, in order to settle these homeless women and children, are planning to build another refugee camp. The location of the camp is being actively sought, and the number of people to be accommodated in the future will be about three thousand. In addition, before the refugee houses in King's Park, North Point, and Ma Tau Chung were built, the authorities used the Hong Kong and Kowloon National Hospital and government agencies as temporary refugee sites. The refugees benefited greatly. In the future, after this new camp is opened, more refugees will be able to obtain shelter and will no longer suffer from living in the open. In addition, in the past, thousands of Chinese troops entered the territory. After being transported from Freedom Shipping to Ma Tau Chung refugee camp, they have been there for several months. The authorities are now planning to implement the second step of the plan in order to have more locations to uniformly settle refugees, by building a new camp near Ma Tau Chung, specifically to accommodate Chinese troops, so that the empty refugee camp houses can be opened as refugee residences, to avoid Chinese troops and refugees mixing together, and easier management. This plan will be realized in the shortest possible time.

Survey of Refugee Accommodation in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories

A survey of the total number of Chinese military refugees accommodated in various districts of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories currently reaches 10,184 people, including (King's Park Camp) a total of 1,470 people, 663 men, 505 women, and 311 children; (Ma Tau Chung) a total of 1,000 people, 561 men, 329 women, and 100 children; (North Point) a total of 1,527 people, 486 men, 711 women, and 330 children; (Kam Tin) a total of 2,750 people, 2,369 adults, and 381 children; (Cuo Hang) a total of 641 people, 535 adults, and 116 children; (Fanling North Station) a total of 835 people, 742 adults, and 93 children; (Fanling South Station) a total of 1,036 people, 913 adults, and 123 children; (San Uk Ling) a total of 916 people, 827 adults, and 89 children.

### From New Opera to New National Drama

— Hu Chunlian

In China, spoken drama is a transplant from foreign lands, but opera has been a national treasure since the Tang Dynasty. As the orthodox form of drama, and as the main entertainment for the masses, it has had such a long history, and its impact on the people must be enormous. Since the Republic of China, many progressive intellectuals have devoted themselves to the introduction and construction of spoken drama, but when it comes to opera, they consider it to be outdated and reactionary, not worth discussing. As a result, the revolution of opera has been delayed, the remaining feudal forces have received more support, the popularization of spoken drama has been hampered, and the establishment of a new national drama is even more distant.

After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, cultural salvation workers began to pay attention to this opera, which has a large audience. Thus, the transformation of the content and the training of actors began to be put into practice. The revolution of old plays and the development of the salvation drama movement were coordinated, and opera workers and spoken drama workers jointly participated in the united front of the Chinese drama world. In the course of the War of Resistance and National Construction, they will be able to build the foundation of a new national drama.

We want to discuss "From New Opera to New National Drama" from this point of view.

The opera of the Tang and Song dynasties was the infancy of Chinese drama. By the Yuan Dynasty, Chinese drama began to grow up. The original power, the thick atmosphere, the popular forms, the diverse content, and the widespread influence of the Yuan Dynasty drama are comparable to the drama of any country and any period. The drama of the Ming Dynasty was said to be more advanced than that of the Yuan Dynasty in terms of art. It was refined and classicized. The dramatic change from five acts to forty acts is a miracle in literary history. But on the other hand, it moved away from the masses and entered the court. The widespread artistic activities among the people became static literary works.

For this reason, chaotic tunes evolved from the legendary system, showing a trend of demanding liberation. The xipi, erhuang, and qinqiang melodies were the wild counterparts of Ming Dynasty drama. By the early years of the Republic of China, the xipi and erhuang melodies, which had been raised by the court into tame playthings, also underwent a revolution. The masses' pursuit of new things made Mei Lanfang have to perform improved Peking operas such as "A Strand of Hemp" and "An Autopsy to Verify Flowers."

The demand for "full plays" (i.e., stories with a beginning and an end, rather than fragments of small settings) was strengthened. Thus, in the north, there were new operas with songs and dances suitable for Mei Lanfang's performance; in the south, there were Ouyang Yuqian's creations such as "The Peach Blossom on a Human Face," "Pan Jinlian," and "Liu Sanjie," which overflowed with anti-feudal sentiments.

What best illustrates this demand is the growth and change of Han tunes and Cantonese tunes. Especially Cantonese tunes, with their brand new, easy-to-sing, and easy-to-listen flat-tone melodies, and stories with a beginning and an end, are what society needs, or at least can accept. But at the same time, the mixing of Chinese and Western music, the convergence of ancient and modern costumes, vulgar humor, and the abuse of mechanical sets are all low-level and unreasonable phenomena that are criticized by the world. These are all abnormal manifestations in the transition period, which proves that the new opera has not yet been established, and also indicates that the new opera must be established.

The development of machinery and stage technology has promoted the collapse of opera and the beginning of new experiments. The national liberation movement has deepened her political awakening and designated a new line.

Anti-Japanese songs in old bottles, Cantonese opera performances on the streets, and Ouyang Yuqian's and Tian Han's experiments such as "The Peach Blossom Fan," "Liang Hongyu," and "New Yanmen Pass" all showed that new content was demanding new forms, and new wine would definitely burst the old bottles.

Now, the reform of drama is even more necessary, and only now is the reform of drama most possible. Under the call of the great era, in the demand of new reality, opera must also undergo drastic changes. We can assert that the emergence of new opera must be completed simultaneously with the great cause of resisting Japan and building the country.

The Sinicization of spoken drama and the modernization of opera, their intersection is the establishment of a new national drama. In this journey, we can define the content and form of opera:

1.  The content of the new opera must be the conscious moth's absorption of social reality from ancient and modern times, serving the resistance against Japan and the construction of the country, and cultivating the national spirit of progress, struggle, benevolence, and love. It must be a record of the struggle against aggression and oppression (in the current stage, it is anti-fascist).
2.  The new opera must have an organic organization, with a story with a beginning and an end, a scientific organization, and a rendering of a major form.
3.  The performance of the new opera will be "more human." That completely dance-like performance can only be used as a reference for a higher form.
4.  The stage aspect of the performance is more scientific, requiring all the conditions of modern art.
5.  The music must be changed from Chinese music to Western music.
6.  The new opera is closer to spoken drama and film. It is diversified.

For the spiritual food of the masses, for the victory of the War of Resistance, we must work hard to write and perform new operas, and promote the establishment of a new national drama!

### On the Reform Movement of Traditional Opera, Discussing Jin Suqin

— Ouyang Yuqian

The vigorous reform movement of traditional opera has only been acknowledged as a branch of China's dramatic activities for two years. However, due to the small number of comrades engaged in this movement, it has not yet fully unfolded. After the August 13th Incident, the cultural sphere recognized the necessity of using traditional opera for propaganda. Only then was traditional opera re-evaluated. Last year, the Theatrical Circles Salvation Association was organized in Wuhan, and branches were subsequently established in Changsha and Chongqing. Han opera, Xiang opera, Chu opera, and Sichuan troupes joined together, presenting a very vibrant scene. Although it suffered a blow due to the fall of Wuhan, this movement has not stopped in the slightest. Recently, I heard that Mr. Tian Han in Changsha has organized the actors of Xiang opera. I believe that after a considerable period, there will definitely be considerable achievements.

Speaking of myself, having spent twenty years in the traditional opera world and having experienced over a decade of supporting roles, I naturally have an unshirkable duty towards the reform movement of traditional opera, a desire I've harbored for a long time. However, the reform plan only gradually solidified after returning from Europe. Even after the plan was set, it only amounted to a few essays. Drama must be realized on stage to see its true value. However, in recent years, due to personal obstacles, the volatility of my own life, and the ultimate lack of objective conditions, the greatest difficulty has been finding comrades willing to put my plan on stage for experimentation. Thankfully, this War of Resistance has allowed me to meet Ms. Jin Suqin, who is a pioneer in helping me conduct this first experiment. Originally, writing plays for others to perform, or using plays I've written to perform myself, wouldn't be something worth mentioning. However, there seems to be a special circumstance: traditional operas I wrote more than a decade ago have been performed by quite a few people, but newly written plays, precisely because they contain some innovative elements, are causing some actors to hesitate. It's not because I secretly feel that the lines I've written recently have disrupted the habits and organization of traditional opera in many places, but rather that the aims and methods of the reform movement are incompatible with the commercial market. Actors only seek to make a living by going through the motions, and have no time to consider the problems of drama itself, so they muddle along. New attempts are seen as troublesome by most people. Secondly, some young actors do feel that pure traditional opera is increasingly declining, and amid hesitant contemplation, they are gradually developing reformist intentions. However, objective circumstances and personal oppression force them to only occasionally talk about it after tea and wine, unable to resolutely participate in the reform movement. Under these circumstances, Ms. Jin's enthusiasm and her resolute attitude cannot but be said to be rare.

She learned to sing opera from a young age, and driven by the needs of making a living, traveled throughout the northern and southern provinces, experiencing the bitterness and sweetness of life. Her theatrical skills also gradually improved through refinement. At the same time, being subjected to various stimuli and oppressions, she urgently wanted to seek liberation from a life of being a puppet and find a correct new direction for her profession—Dian opera—to establish herself. Therefore, she easily accepted the theory of reform. What is most commendable is that she has a fairly rich understanding of scripts. Thus, once she has performed a more meaningful, organized, and grammatically sound script, she is unwilling to perform nonsensical plays again. As a result, her joining a troupe to perform becomes a problem, because once she joins a troupe, she has no right to choose roles, let alone choose plays. Therefore, despite the many stages vying to invite her, she always wants to wait for the situation to improve before organizing her own troupe. Last March, she even expressed to me that from now on, she would not perform any dramas that were not related to the reform movement. I thought that was impossible. At the time, I advised her that better traditional plays could still be performed, and that performing them was also good. First, there are too few newly written plays. Second, without applying oneself, one does not yet have a sound troupe, nor a dedicated stage. It is impossible to rehearse new plays every day while joining other people's troupes. Third, being able to perform traditional operas well also leaves those who are superstitious about traditional operas with no excuse. They cannot say that they are messing around with a set of reform ideas because they cannot perform traditional operas, or because they do not perform traditional operas well. Moreover, personal life cannot be completely sacrificed. In the initial stage of any movement, it always progresses step by step. It is impossible to set a high standard and sit at home waiting to achieve the goal. Of course, there are also many people who are intent on destruction and say cold words, but we can ignore them. Currently, there are two problems that need to be solved: (1) There needs to be more plays. (2) A group of actors who have a better understanding needs to be found to form a sound group. As for the rise and fall of an individual's career at a certain period, it is not a problem, but striving to win the audience is also something that should not be ignored.

Film and Drama Mini-Review

### "Patriotic Female Artist"

— Pan Lang

Since the arrival in Hong Kong of Ms. Jin Ziqin, who is hailed as a "new woman of the theatrical world, a patriotic female artist," promotional materials have been eye-catching everywhere. Newspapers have been publishing "special features" and "exclusive reports," and even special editions, which can truly be said to be the height of her popularity! Much has already been said about Ms. Jin's patriotic ideas and artistic attainments, so I will not discuss them for the time being. Judging only from the troupe's vigorous use of "patriotic female artist" and "national salvation new national opera" as promotional materials, it can be regarded as a good phenomenon in the current drama movement.

Now, the "national salvation new national opera" starring the "patriotic female artist" has met the people of Hong Kong. As for how the performance itself is, there will naturally be expert evaluations and audience recognition. We hope that it can live up to past publicity and meet the expectations of all parties. The Hong Kong drama community should also, from the standpoint of pure friendship, criticize or provide opinions for the sake of developing the national salvation drama movement.

However, one thing that cannot but be regretted is that the ticket prices set for Ms. Jin's "national salvation new national opera" this time seem to be too high, causing ordinary audience members who love drama to sigh with regret, which clearly goes against the original intention of promoting the national salvation drama movement. We hereby urge theater owners or troupe leaders and patriotic drama artists such as Ms. Jin to pay attention to this point, based on the principle of "making drama a tool for mobilizing the masses and serving the War of Resistance, national construction, and national liberation." At the same time, based on the actual situation in the drama community in the past, we feel that this phenomenon is not limited to one time or one place. Therefore, we hope even more that drama fighters who are enthusiastic about the national and social liberation movement will make greater efforts to use the power of the united front to enable patriotic drama artists and national salvation dramas to be close to the general public and prevent the "aristocratization" of patriotic drama artists and the "courtly" nature of national salvation dramas!

This time, Ms. Jin starred in "national salvation new national opera." According to reports, all the seats in the hall were sold out on the first day, which is enough to show the appeal of patriotic and national salvation dramas and the enthusiasm of Hong Kong compatriots for national salvation dramas. Under the encouragement of this appeal and the enthusiasm of the audience, theater owners or troupe leaders must at least recognize the sacred duty of every Chinese person in the War of Resistance, learn from the "China Art Troupe," which is currently touring for charity performances to help disaster victims, and hold a few more charity performances to donate money to the motherland and help refugees. At the same time, we hope that Ms. Jin, in order to be worthy of the honor of "patriotic female artist," will vigorously promote this move. We hereby make this small request for the sake of millions of refugees and the motherland in the flames of war!

### Vanguard of the Old Opera Reform Movement: Performance by the China Drama Troupe

The repertoire includes "Liang Hongyu," "The Peach Blossom Fan," "The Fisherman's Lament," etc.

After the outbreak of the national War of Resistance, in order to mobilize the vast masses, traditional opera, which has always been loved by the vast masses, began to attract the attention of cultural salvation workers. Those who first started the old opera reform movement were advanced members of the Chinese theatrical world, such as Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, and Ms. Jin Ziqin, a female Peking opera singer, was the pioneer in implementing this movement. Before the fall of Greater Shanghai, under the guidance of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, she organized a "China Drama Troupe" to publicly perform Ouyang's new national salvation opera "Liang Hongyu." The day of the performance coincided with the retreat of our army in Nanshi, and the situation was extremely tense. At that time, Mr. Guo Moruo wrote a poem for her: "In the past, there was Liang Hongyu, and now we see Jin Suqin; the hatred of the enemy is the same for thousands of years, and the feeling touches people's hearts in the same way." Subsequently, she continued to perform new national salvation operas such as "The Peach Blossom Fan" and "The Fisherman's Lament" in Shanghai. Later, due to the oppression of the environment, this movement could not continue. After Mr. Ouyang went south, he never forgot the continuation of this movement, but unfortunately, he could not find anyone to cooperate with. Recently, Ms. Jin, unwilling to be confined to the isolated island for a long time, came to Hong Kong specifically. Therefore, they have rejoined forces to continue the past movement of improving Peking opera and national salvation drama. Now, the China Drama Troupe officially began performing at the Lee Theatre last night. The first night's repertoire was "Liang Hongyu," written and directed by Mr. Ouyang and starring Ms. Jin. The new Peking operas of national salvation to be performed in succession will include: "The Peach Blossom Fan," "The Fisherman's Lament," "Diao Chan," etc. The performance will last for ten days, which will be a great impact on Hong Kong's old opera scene!

### China Art Troupe Begins Touring Charity Performance Yesterday

The China Art Troupe, after holding a touring charity performance in response to the One Dollar Debt Repayment Movement, sent letters to various charity organizations and schools in Hong Kong requesting cooperation. Last night, the troupe went to Qingshan at the invitation of the students of the Affiliated Middle School of Lingnan University to participate in the school's fraternity gathering, as the beginning of the China Art Troupe's touring charity performance. The repertoire performed was "Put Down Your Whip," which deeply moved about three hundred audience members. After the performance, a donation was solicited from the audience on the spot for the One Dollar Debt Repayment Movement, raising sixteen one-dollar bills, five hundred and ten ten-cent silver coins, and one hundred and forty cents, and some elementary school students donated five food coupons worth four cents each, totaling sixty-eight Hong Kong dollars and sixty cents, which were announced by the student union representative after being counted, and the funds were directly transferred to the Bank of China. Although the amount donated in this touring charity performance was not large, with the spirit of the China Art Troupe and the cooperation of various organizations and schools, there will definitely be more satisfactory results in the future. The troupe's second public performance is scheduled for the 28th, 29th, and 30th of this month, and the venue is still the Central Theatre. At the same time, after the second public performance, they will hold a charity performance to raise funds to help refugees in Guangdong and Guangxi, probably in mid-April.

### Stage Technique Talks

— Lu Dun

IV. Rehearsal Work

After all the preparatory work has been done, rehearsals can begin. Rehearsal is the most practical work, the creative process of a performance.

Once a decision has been made to begin rehearsals, the director calls together all the actors and related staff, such as prompters and sound effects personnel, to prepare to begin rehearsing. For rehearsals, four or five weeks are appropriate for a long play, and two weeks for a short play. Anything shorter is too rushed, but the time should not be extended too long, especially under our current circumstances, where there is really no allowance for sufficient time, and actors' interest may disappear if it's too long.

Before officially starting rehearsals, there is a round-table reading of the script. This is the method of the Moscow Art Theatre. The time spent on this reading is not wasted, because all aspects of performance technique, especially the actors' technique, are largely researched and decided at this time.

During the round-table reading, the director can publicly present the research on the script and their own attitude towards the script, the techniques to be used in the performance, and the requirements for the actors. At the same time, the personality, habitual language, tone, and habitual movements, emotional use, and grasp of the climax of each character can be discussed and decided.

On the actor's side, they can also use this time to become familiar with the script, correct awkward phrases, and discuss and research with their partners to achieve complete cooperation with each other.

The most ideal rehearsal should take place on the stage every time, but this is not possible in the current situation. However, the rehearsal place should ideally be the same size as the stage on which it will be performed, especially for those actors without stage experience, because if the rehearsal place is too small, they will feel vast and boundless when they step onto the big stage. A round table that can be reached in two steps during rehearsal may require ten steps on stage. When such a situation is encountered, actors with rich stage experience are fine, but for new actors with little experience, they often make mistakes in the predetermined positions during rehearsal. When the position is wrong, the cooperation with the other party also goes wrong, and then they become flustered and helpless. How can they perform a good play?

During rehearsals, various large props can be replaced by other things when absolutely necessary. The small props have a very close relationship. For example, an actor should pick up a cigarette while saying a certain line, light it when they get to the last line, and throw away the match when the other person starts speaking... because this simple little action may be a good effect, but the acquisition of this effect requires the movement time to match, so this must be practiced during rehearsal. If these smoking devices are ignored during rehearsal, it will not be easy to match the appropriate time when the performance is on, and the effect will be lost. The performance of drama is the art of rhythmic time, just like a piece of music, with beats and rhythms, and this progression tune is determined during rehearsal.

The play is of course rehearsed one act at a time, but each act can also be rehearsed in sections. The division of sections is generally based on the entrance and exit of the characters. Furthermore, each section is divided into smaller segments based on the changes in emotion. First rehearse the small segments, then rehearse the sections, then the acts, and finally the entire play.

During the initial rehearsal, the director should not demand too much of the actors, and it is enough to get the large positions familiar, but the most important thing is to explain to the actors why they should run from here to there, because this is the only way to be natural and not stiff. Because between each slightly larger action and another action, there must be a small action to continue without losing naturalness. If the actor understands the meaning from one action to another, the actor themselves will naturally do the subtle parts.

Once the large positions are familiar, the detailed rehearsal begins, which is the time to concentrate. At this time, all the predetermined effects must be made. The director can also ask the actors for everything they want. Small actions must come out, mutual breathing must be paid attention to, emotions must be grasped, and work must be done seriously. The success or failure of the future performance depends entirely on this.

The period of paper rehearsal is the most strenuous time for the director. He is like the conductor of an orchestra, manipulating the entire orchestra and the performance of each musician. At this time, the director will not sit comfortably in a corner. He may walk up and down, or he may crouch next to the actors, but he is not prompting, but manipulating the soul of the actor, prompting the plot of each scene, the appropriateness of emotions, and the expression of time, which is the most important move in the performance!

After a considerable period of detailed rehearsals, the director considers it to be mature enough and can hold a trial performance. If it is not possible to have a trial performance on the stage, there must be a serious trial performance with all the large and small props and sound effects ready, just like the performance. At this time, the director can sit comfortably in the audience and enjoy it. However, he still has work to do and must record anything that is not suitable in the play during the trial performance and make corrections later.

When the real performance comes, the director can watch the play leisurely, because he has no more burdens and his work has been completed.

### South China Controls the Game, Eliminates Eastern 6-1, Eastern's Decisive Defeat Shows Inferior Skill, This Victory Makes the Silver Shield Seem Assured for South China

[Special Report] It is a fact that the technical skills of the Eastern Athletic Association's entire First Division football team have recently improved compared to the past. They even had the opportunity to rest and take advantage in the league, causing a minor setback for South China, which is also a fact. Therefore, some people overestimated Eastern's fighting power, thinking that their level was now comparable to South China and could form a balanced force. So, before yesterday's special Silver Shield semi-final began, when discussing the outcome, opinions were divided, but more people believed that Eastern was confident of victory.

The truth is still the truth. The evidence of Eastern's inferiority to South China was revealed in yesterday's match. That evidence is the huge score of 6-1. Although this vastly different result cannot determine that Eastern is weak, it is undeniable that it is South China's greatness. Afterwards, some people said, "Yesterday's weather was a mix of rain and sunshine, and the field was wet, which greatly affected Eastern's players. Their performance was not as good as it could have been, leading to defeat. If the weather had been clear and the ground dry, Eastern's forwards could have launched a surprise attack and seriously threatened South China. If they could have scored more than one goal back, they might not have lost so badly." Speaking of the rain problem, it not only affected Eastern but also South China. However, South China's ability is not controlled by the environment but can control the environment. This is their true skill in difficult situations.

The reason for South China's big win is that they were able to control the situation and take the initiative. The advantage of this control is that each player has a good command of the ball, and they respond to each other with coordinated advances and retreats. Although the field was slippery, they still maintained their connection and passing, which was appropriate in every aspect. They put on a game that clearly won with skill. On the other hand, although Eastern's players were all brave in their efforts, their command of the ball was not as skillful as South China's. As a result, their connection was scattered, and even the only advantage of the front line, the surprise attack, did not succeed even once throughout the whole game. Only Xu Jingcheng managed to restrain South China's defense to some extent.

In this game, South China's Liu Qingcai was absent. Although Guo Yingqi, who replaced him in the front line, performed very well, even the fierce Xu Jingcheng was sometimes contained by him. The cunning Hou Chengtuo was even more unable to succeed under double surveillance. Chen Bingtu sometimes had gaps to exploit, but his passing was often untimely, making his efforts futile. Li Deqi also couldn't penetrate, so he had very few opportunities. Occasionally, he had brilliant shots, but they were saved by Zhang Rongcai's excellent goalkeeping. Rongcai's high skill was also fully demonstrated in this game.

In the past, many people thought that Eastern's forward line was better than South China's. However, yesterday's battle gave us an answer. Although South China was missing Shen Yucai due to a foot injury, Liang Rongzhao's versatile performance, covering both front and back, and Li Guowei and Yingzu's coordinated response from left and right, created a perfect combination, performing interception, attack, and passing skills, all of which were excellent. Compared with Eastern's forwards, they were indeed overshadowed.

When the clock struck four, South China's Liu Qingcai had not arrived, which made the coach very anxious. Because the battle drum was urging frequently, he was forced to send ten players into the field. After four minutes, he quickly supplemented with Li En'en, and switched Guo Qi back to right forward, forming the following lineup:

(South China Lineup)

Zhang Rongcai

Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan

Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Guo Yingqi

Luo Douwen, Li Zhaorong, Feng Jingxiang, Li Enliang, Deng Guangsen

(Eastern Athletic Association)

Liu Xianhan

Miao Guohua, Zeng Zhongyun

Luo Weiquan, Song Lingsheng, Liu Shidu

Hou Chengtuo, Xu Jingcheng, Li Deqi, Wu Qixiang, Chen Bingtu

First Half

18 minutes, South China attacked. Eastern's center backs rushed to the rescue. Zhaorong got the ball and went straight to the goal like a horse off its leash. Shorty Liu Shidu saw that the capital was about to fall and rode to the rescue, tripping Zhaorong. The referee immediately awarded a penalty. Jingxiang took the penalty kick and scored with one shot (1-0).

23 minutes, the short and nimble Yingqi sent a long pass from the right. Jingxiang pretended to intercept the ball but suddenly let it pass to Zhaorong. Zhaorong, about ten yards from the goal, used his "slingshot" kick and sent the ball into the net (2-0).

27 minutes, Qi didn't know what kind of stimulant he had taken, darting left and right and gaining possession. He cleverly passed it to Li Enliang. Enliang saw Jingxiang active in Eastern's territory and immediately passed it to him. Jingxiang raised his foot to shoot, hitting Xianhan's body directly and rebounding out. Jingxiang shot again, and Xianhan was unable to save it (3-0).

Second Half

5 minutes, Jingxiang controlled the ball skillfully, dodging left and right, creating a path forward, and cleverly passing it to Zhaorong. Zhongyun turned around to chase, but it was too late. Zhaorong scored a single-handedly (4-0).

12 minutes, Jingcheng made a detour, gritting his teeth, and passed through many obstacles. He shot when he had the chance, but Rongcai dove to the ground and pushed it out of bounds, only conceding a corner kick.

25 minutes, Eastern worked hard to strengthen their attack and broke into South China's territory. Zhaorong returned to defend and battled with Bingtu. Bingtu managed to steal the ball and cross it. Qixiang intercepted the ball and passed it to Jingcheng. Jingcheng shot with his left foot, and Rongcai was unable to save it. Eastern broke the shutout (4-1).

36 minutes, the skilled Jingxiang was still in control. Seeing Zhaorong standing in a good position, he sent a perfect pass. Zhaorong lived up to his mission and scored again in an undefended location (5-1).

41 minutes, Guangsen took a corner kick. After South China's forwards poured into the goal area and kicked it out, Zhaorong headed the ball into the net in the crowd (6-1).

43 minutes, Eastern launched a fierce counterattack. The vanguard besieged South China, and shots rained down, dazzling the eye. Qixiang shot a ball in a hurry, hitting the crossbar and bouncing out. Tiansheng cleared it with one kick. The game ended, and Eastern was eliminated 6-1.

### Kwong Wah Easily Defeats Hong Kong Football Club, A Comfortable 3-1 Victory

The league match between Kwong Wah and the Hong Kong Football Club was played at the Caroline Hill pitch yesterday afternoon at 4:31 pm. As a result of the fierce battle, Kwong Wah won 3-1 due to the skillful use of their soldiers and coordinated connections, defeating the Hong Kong Football Club. At the beginning of yesterday's match, Hong Kong FC was still able to parry and occasionally look for opportunities to counterattack. However, in the second half, they showed their weakness and were heavily besieged by Kwong Wah. If Kwong Wah's forwards had made more short passes and shot when they saw an opportunity, the winning goals would have been more than that.

Yesterday, Kwong Wah's front and rear lines fought exceptionally hard, and their performance was particularly wonderful. The forward line has shown progress technically compared to the past. The attacking power of the Hong Kong Football Club mainly relied on the center forward and the two inside forwards. The two inside backs were the weakest, so they were often the main areas of attack for Kwong Wah. Overall, the best players for both teams were Zou Wenzhi, Che Shijin, Hou Rongsheng, and Li Guoqi for Kwong Wah, followed by Huang Jicong and Qian Chifen. For Hong Kong FC, they were Jia Ya, Wei Luson, Pa Lu, and Yi Shi She Lan Zhi.

When the battle began, Kwong Wah's front immediately attacked the key areas of Hong Kong FC, charging left and right like an avalanche. Soon, Shijin advanced into the territory, knocking on the door. The ball was as fast as an arrow, and Gao Lushi jumped to save it, but it was too late. Unfortunately, the ball was slightly high and only grazed the crossbar. Later, the two Zou and Huang followed closely to defend, but they were ambushed in front of the goal and forced to retreat. After a long battle, Chifen once again kicked the ball forward. Yi Shi She Lanzhi came out to block, but the ball was intercepted by Wenqia. Zou dodged left and right, aimed at the target, and shot with his foot, sending the ball into the net. After Hong Kong FC took the lead, they launched a full counterattack. Wei Lu and others explored the goal successively, but due to the lack of skill in their footwork, they ultimately achieved nothing.

Twenty-five minutes into the game, Bingjin rushed along the side and passed the ball diagonally to the left. Jingting intercepted it and shot fiercely, going as fast as lightning, accurately and powerfully. However, it hit Gao Lushi's body directly and was blocked out. Before long, the first half ended, with Kwong Wah leading 1-0.

In the second half, Hong Kong FC's Pa Lu counterattacked from the side. Hua Ji came out to block him, only conceding a corner kick, thus escaping a major danger. At this time, Hong Kong FC continued to attack, but Kwong Wah's defense was tight, making it impossible to cross the line. Soon, Bingjin dribbled the ball straight up the side, and Shijin responded in front of the goal and shot it into the net. Then, Wenzhi scored another goal, adding icing to the cake. At this point, Hong Kong FC, unwilling to be shut out, launched a large-scale attack. Finally, Jia Ya returned a goal to Kwong Wah, ending the game 3-1. The lineups of both sides were as follows:

(Kwong Wah)

Li Guoqi

Zhong Huilin, Hou Rongsheng

Huang Huaji, Yang Zixiang, Zhang Shuhui

Huang Jingting, Deng Wenzhi, Qian Chifen, Zhuo Shijin, Liang Bingjin

(Hong Kong Football Club)

Gao Lushi

Qi An, Mei Lingdun

Bao Di, Yi Shi Du, Lan Zhi, Ge Yun

### Only One First Division Football Match Today, Eastern vs. St. Joseph's

Today, there will be one match each in the First, Second, and Third Division football leagues. According to the original schedule, the First Division had Eastern vs. St. Joseph's and He Ge vs. South China. However, the He Ge vs. South China match has been postponed, so there is only the Eastern vs. St. Joseph's match. In the first week of the competition, Eastern defeated St. Joseph's 4-3. However, St. Joseph's forward Wu Derong punched Xie Jinhong in the match against South China on the 4th of this month. The Football Association ruled to suspend him the day before yesterday. Da Gao Shan Nu Bi Lu Du and others are also said to be tired. It is expected that their lineup will not be complete. From this point of view, Eastern should be able to win. However, Eastern's players played in the Silver Shield match yesterday, and they are all tired. They will play again today, and it is not known whether they can support it. Therefore, this is a bit worrying. The schedule for today is as follows:

First Division 4:30 PM

Eastern Athletic Association vs. St. Joseph's Hong Kong Football Club Pitch

Second Division 3:00 PM

Military Supplies vs. 5th Battalion Artillery Happy Valley Pitch

A Division 3:00 PM

### Men's Basketball Tournament, Eastern Team Wins the First Game, Women's Awards Ceremony and Championship Team Performance

[Special Report] After the women's basketball tournament ended, the basketball court had been quiet for a long time. Yesterday, it became lively again because the women's awards ceremony was held last night, and it was also the beginning of the men's basketball tournament.

According to the schedule, the first game was the awards ceremony, with this year's women's champion team, Mei Fang, playing against the Hong Kong United team.

Mei Fang's Meilian was not on the field, which was a pity. However, looking at Hong Kong United, it was only composed of players from Xuehua, South China, Southwest China, and Overseas Chinese teams. Their strength was not very strong.

In the first quarter, Hong Kong United scored first, taking the lead. After a while, Zan Zhen returned a basket, and the score caught up later. In this quarter, Hong Kong United lost 6-4.

Both sides made progress in the second quarter, and they even tied at 8-8 at one point. Although Shouguang's performance last night was wonderful, his shooting was slightly inaccurate. As a result, they still lagged behind 8-12 in this quarter.

The second half was even more of Mei Fang's world. Although Hong Kong United tried hard, their connection was scattered, and they fought independently. The whole game was lost 18-10 to the champion team.

As for the awards ceremony, it was held after the first quarter. Chen Huiqing presented the awards, and the ceremony was very simple. After the awards ceremony, the men's basketball game began, with the Eastern team playing against the University of Hong Kong team.

For Eastern, Nianhua, Xv Heng, Dingfen, and Jian performed very well. For the University of Hong Kong, although Xuhua worked hard, one tree could not support a collapsing building. As a result, it was only in vain.

After the start, it was a tense game between you and me. However, after about ten minutes, the people of Hong Kong showed that they could not hold on. Eastern's iron cavalry frequently stepped all over the territory. During this time, Dingfen and Nianhua worked very hard, so that the University of Hong Kong could only defend and could not fight back. Brother Heng was also good, and he often won a lot of applause from the audience. At halftime, Eastern led 36-14. In the second half, Eastern's performance was even better. Dingfen and Nianhua were like butterflies dancing among flowers, and their shooting accuracy was like picking things out of a bag. The score gradually increased. At this time, the University of Hong Kong players were already exhausted and panting like cows. The final result was 73-25, Eastern won.

The last game was between the Youth team of the Second Division and Lingying Middle School. The strength of the Youth team was very different. They were at a disadvantage throughout the game. The final score was 50-35, and Lingying won.

### Golf Club Rebuilding Clubhouse

The Royal Hong Kong Golf Club held its annual meeting yesterday at St. John's Cathedral. More than 200 members attended. The chairman was Aizhiba.

The construction cost was stipulated not to exceed 400,000 yuan. 300,000 yuan will be borrowed from outside gradually, and then paid back from the admission tickets.

### One Hundred and One Tips for Climbing the Ladder in Hollywood

(65) Come to Hollywood with your mother for a two-week vacation, visit friends, one of whom works for a film company. This is the kind of help Nan Grey needed.

(66) Stand out in smaller theaters near Hollywood—like Robert Young and Katharine Hepburn did.

(67) Become famous on the radio. If your face matches your voice, you'll be as lucky as Bing Crosby, Don Ameche, Jack Benny, and Joe Penner.

(68) Study singing for years, then perform a concert in Los Angeles. A year later, you might get a screen role. Nelson Eddy did it this way.

(69) Be a wealthy lawyer—often acting in amateur theater—run out of money—and then get on the screen with the help of friends. This is how Samuel S. Hinds first became a character actor.

(70) Be taken in and raised by a director, like Katherine DeMille.

(71) Be the daughter of a cameraman, like Joan Marsh.

(72) If a magazine novel is being made into a movie, and you look exactly like the hero in the novel's illustrations, try your luck. This is why Cornel Wilde played Kid Galahad.

(73) Solicit newspaper ads in the film company's office. John Patterson got his chance on screen this way.

(74) Work as a waiter in a big Hollywood hotel, unexpectedly burst into song along with the music. Douglas Fowley tried his luck this way.

(75) Be a dance instructor. If one of your students gets a screen test, go to the film company with her as her guardian. Grace Ford entered the film industry this way.

(76) If your friend is being tested, and you're asked to read the script for him/her, read it well. You might succeed, like Virginia Field (her friend failed).

(77) Marry a female star, and perhaps she can get you a screen test. Leonard Penn relied on his wife, Gladys George, for help.

(78) If you have eight years of performance experience before the age of twelve, boldly ask for a job at a film company like Judy Garland did. You probably won't be rejected.

(79) Close your eyes and pick a director's name from the phone book, go see him and ask for his help. This is Kenneth Howell's method.

(80) Live next door to a director, have him pat you on the head, and introduce you to the film industry, like how a director introduced David Holt.

(81) Come to Hollywood as a writer and director, follow the production team to Monogram Pictures, and when a comedian happens to get sick, you can replace him. Hugh Herbert immediately became a famous comedian.

(82) Bring a letter of introduction to a director in Hollywood, like Jack Oakie did. Nothing else is necessary.

(83) Interview stars for a British magazine, and have the magazine publish a photo of you together. Buck Jones chose Dorothy Hope as his leading lady after seeing a photo of her with himself.

(84) "Capture alive" some wild animals, like Frank Buck (though he got scratched by his captives once).

(85) If you're accurate with your shots, able to shatter the glass in an actor's hand off-camera, you'll be noticed, like Sammy McKim.

(86) Win an essay contest and be sent to Russia, have your parents object, drawing attention from the newspapers. Frances Farmer got a screen test because of this.

(87) Perform makeup demonstrations for a cosmetics store related to a film company. They won't ignore you, at least they didn't ignore Marla Shelton.

(88) Write some film shorts for yourself. Robert Benchley succeeded in this area.

(89) Be a dressing room attendant for a film star for six years, then join a black amateur performance group. This is Louise Beaver's past.

(90) Practice kissing skills diligently. Frank Shields became the star of "Come and Take It" because he won a kissing contest.

(91) Be able to joke around with the Marx Brothers. Margaret Dumont could, so the film industry used her.

(92) If you come to Hollywood on vacation and wholeheartedly dedicate yourself to your career, and someone tells you that you're perfect to play a gangster on screen, ignore them. Didn't George Raft ignore them? Yet he is now a big star.

(93) Be able to sneeze in a way that no one else can. Bill Gilbert's stardom relies entirely on his nose—and a very annoying one at that.

(94) Often play supporting roles for a famous actor, so he feels he can't go to Hollywood without you, like Smiley Burnette for Gene Autry.

(95) Undress carelessly in public places, so Gypsy Rose Lee became Louise Hovick on screen.

(96) Sell magazines in front of the studio gate. Irena Benett didn't get noticed after winning a bodybuilding competition, but she was discovered by the film industry because of this.

(97) Come to Hollywood, speak with a Viennese accent, dress in Parisian styles, and have the American press exaggerate your image, making Americans think you're a real countess. Sari Maritza succeeded with this method.

(98) Imitate the actions of stars in Hollywood revues, like Kim Hye-soo. Someone will eventually notice your cleverness and wit.

(99) Write a letter to the film company's casting department, briefly and without exaggeration stating your special characteristics. Veda Ann Borg unexpectedly received a reply.

(100) Actors who are already famous elsewhere—preferably abroad—are the easiest to recruit, such as Danielle Darrieux, Annabella, Charles Boyer, Charles Laughton, Marlene Dietrich, and Luise Rainer.

(101) Learn basic acting skills at home, in small theaters, or in amateur classes—wherever you can find them—then go to the New York stage for further training. This is not the quickest shortcut, but it is the most reliable method. In fact, it is the only reliable method. There are too many examples of success with this method to list, but let's pick a few of the most famous ones: Paul Muni, Spencer Tracy, Margaret Sullavan, Claudette Colbert, James Stewart, and Basil Rathbone.

### "Peace," "Struggle," "Save China!"

— Wen Yu

"...In a quiet sickroom, a dying patient lay on the bed, his face gradually fading, his eyes gradually drying up, a faint breath intermittently escaping from his lips, barely audible whether it was a groan or a cry, 'Peace,' 'Struggle,' 'Save China,' one after another, about forty times at least, gradually even his breath could not escape, all that could be seen was the slight movement of his lips..."

What a touching description—Wang Jingwei, then still a follower of Sun Yat-sen, so touchingly recorded Sun Yat-sen's dying moments and his dying cry—representing his lifelong fighting spirit, and marking the demands of the entire Chinese nation: "Peace," "Struggle," "Save China"!

Although Sun Yat-sen did not personally witness the unprecedented disaster of the "September 18th Incident," he had a premonition. He had long pointed out, "Strong neighbors surround us, eyeing us with predatory intent... nibbling and devouring, already effective in rapid succession, partitioning and dismembering, truly worrying in the present situation." He also affirmed the inevitability of Japan's invasion of China. Therefore, although he did not personally lead the entire nation into the "July" liberation struggle, he had already pointed out, "A unified China can resist Japanese oppression." He left behind the doctrine of national salvation—the Three Principles of the People; he left behind the political agenda of national salvation—alliance with Russia, accommodation of the Communists, and the three major policies supporting workers and peasants; he left behind the three slogans of "Peace," "Struggle," and "Save China" in his last breath. Sun Yat-sen had lit the streetlights, and the ranks of the national war were filled with enthusiasm, courage, and a desire for light, embarking on the road of July!

Struggle for peace, struggle for lasting world peace, struggle to eliminate war forever through war, struggle for humanity! The most realistic goal is "Save China," the most glorious task is "For humanity." We not only ourselves, the entire nation, participate in the war, resolutely fighting, we also declare to the world: Fight—for your glory and ours—for your welfare and ours—who is more shameful than worms crying for peace, a humiliating peace? Who is more shameful than distorting Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary slogan, revolutionary doctrine, demonizing the three sacred, fiery, and beautiful cries of "Peace," "Struggle," and "Save China," shamelessly saying: Peace can save China, then we want peace; struggle can save China, then we struggle, using the slogan of war as a banner of surrender, using the sacred promise as a mask of rebellion, abandoning ourselves to humanity? Yes! Sun Yat-sen shouted for peace, this is a prophecy of a world of great harmony, a peace under justice; Sun Yat-sen called for struggle, is "first uniting ourselves, extending it to others, then uniting all small and weak nations, to jointly break the 250 million, jointly using justice to break power" struggle: undoubtedly, the purpose is "Save China," to bring China from a state of temporary security and danger to the road of freedom and liberation—destroying the true meaning of Sun Yat-sen's peace and struggle, painting peace with the color of slavery, distorting the task of saving China into a humiliating act of stealing half the country for temporary peace only to end in destruction, this is Sun Yat-sen's traitor! A thief of progressive humanity!

Fourteen years have passed, we revisit Sun Yat-sen's cry at his death, we feel sorrow, and we also feel excitement! Today is the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death! For peace, for the freedom and liberation of our ancestors, we should stand in each person's position and fight!

### Distant Friendship

— Tang Yingwei

What I cannot forget most in my memory is: a piece of distant friendship bravely fighting the enemy in the flames of war in the North, it is the comfort of my soul, it is the trust of my sincere heart. He is my only best friend!

Since we waved goodbye in the scorching sun of Jiangnan, we have gone our separate ways north and south. It has been three or four years since I returned to the South. In this long separation, our hearts have been longing for each other like exiles. Because our messages are often conveyed on the necks of pigeons.

However, a magical wind rose on the plain, the enemy ignited the line of provocation at Lugou Bridge, and extended their demonic hands to Shanghai to ignite the raging fire of the anti-Japanese war. In order to defend the country and defend the territory, every young man with a sense of responsibility stood on the guard post waiting to fight the enemy.

In the anti-Japanese war full of artillery fire, my heart was as anxious as a bomb for my distant friend—bombing! bombing! retreat! retreat! Retreating to the second line of defense, my friend's home finally fell under the bombing of the X-men. The family of mothers and children wandering on the banks of the river made me hate the brutality of the X-men even more.

When my friend left his mother and pregnant wife to go to the front line to fight the X-men, I received this short letter from him:

"My good friend: I am now a homeless person, and my brothers and sisters are scattered. My wife's sister was bombed to death, and everything is over for me. Now I only have one way, and that is to fight the X-men! Your best friend, Zhen Huang."

The news from the front became more and more tense every day, and my longing for my friend became more and more tense. He will meet the X-men one day, I thought so. But he hasn't given me any news for a long time. How much I miss him!

Our resistance war is unyielding and lasting, and our friendship will not be broken by artillery fire and continues. In the greatest Battle of Wuhan in the Anti-Japanese War, my friend also did his part in the defense work, but after the fall of Wuhan, our news was cut off again.

In despair, I finally received a worn-out letter sent from the front line, how happy I was:

"My good friend: For the past half month, we have been marching from Songbu to Linshanhe, Xinzhou, Shangbahe, Xishui, then from Xishi to Linshanhe, and then from Linshanhe to Tuanfeng, down the Yangtze River, through Shihuiyao, to Ludaoye, Baishapu to Yangxin, not staying in one place for more than three days, so we did very little work for the people. This time from Xinzhou to Ruichang, three nights of marching, the comrades all felt quite tired, so we rested here for one day, and the next day we could start arranging work. Not many people fled Ruichang, but the wartime mobilization work was not done well enough. All people's organizations are mostly forcibly gathered together, because the leadership at the upper level is ineffective. The general public doesn't know what they should do in this critical moment? How to do it well? Each group only has a superficial formation and no actual work performance. So after we came here, we wanted to quickly launch a movement to protect our homes and resist the enemy. There are also many intellectual youths in Ruichang, but their work attitude is mostly incorrect. There is a tendency to be showy, so we also need to correct their mistakes from our actions. We hope to stay here longer. In that case, the foundation of our work may be firmly established. It is less than fifty or sixty miles from here to Jiujiang, and the sound of cannons can already be faintly heard. Yesterday, enemy planes came to visit twice. They dropped a few bombs, but fortunately they didn't hurt many people. Originally, we could have lived in the suburbs like the various agencies of the General Headquarters, but for the convenience of work, we still live in the city. We live in a large flower group, and we feel comfortable with everything. This is the first time we have enjoyed such comfort since the Anti-Japanese War!

…

When I was in Ruichang, I didn't finish writing the letter to you and suddenly received an order to leave. Now we are stationed in a small village less than thirty miles from Jiujiang. We are working every day under the bombing of enemy planes and the sound of cannons. Yesterday and today, Jiujiang has fallen into a state of mixed war, which is certainly very tense, so we dare not have a moment or a trace of slack in our work. This is an important gateway on the east-west Yangtze River in Wuhan, and we must hold on to it. The enemy is also determined to occupy it. Enemy planes are bombing every day, and all the cemeteries in nearby villages and towns have been destroyed. Tens of thousands of farmers were sacrificed. We are watching this scene of bloody chaos. Everyone has deepened their hatred of the enemy...!"

It is really difficult to find an opportunity to send letters by mail in the military. Today, because the comrades are going to the rear, I quickly wrote this letter in a hasty manner. Please don't laugh at me. Because of the time, I will talk about the rest next time!"

After reading this letter, I was deeply moved. I cannot work on the front line like my friend, and I feel ashamed and sad in my heart, but it is also comforting to have a good friend on the battlefield! Selfish thoughts made me feel the loneliness and lack of tension in the rear, and I was condemned.

Sometimes I think of calling my good friend back to the rear to rest for a while, but I often want to go to the front to accompany my comrades. But fate does not allow us to reunite in this distant friendship. I can only be abandoned in the rear forever and accept the good news reported by my comrades on the front line.

It has been a long time since I received news from the front.

—Good friend: We have been living in Qujiang, Guangdong for more than half a month. We have launched a large-scale mass movement here—but, I haven't received your letter for a long time. In my work, how worried I am about you!

Distant friendship! How memorable it will always be!

### Two Puppet Emperors of the Song Dynasty

— Jie

——Notes on Reading History

The Jin people invaded the Song Dynasty and twice set up puppet governments, practicing the strategy of using Chinese to control Chinese. The first time was in the second year of Jingkang. The Jin army attacked Bianjing and took the Huizong and Qinzong emperors away, and then established the Song official Zhang Bangchang as the Emperor of Chu. But later, the Jin army returned north, and Zhang Bangchang abdicated, only serving as emperor for a short-lived thirty-six days. The second time a puppet government was established was in the third year of Jianyan, when the Jin people established Liu Yu as the Emperor of Qi. Liu Yu lived the emperor's life for eight years before being deposed by the Jin people.

Although Zhang Bangchang and Liu Yu were both traitors cursed by the world, there was still a difference in the degree of their betrayal. Zhang Bangchang was forced to become a puppet by the Jin people, not out of his own volition. So after he came to power as a puppet, he was still somewhat scrupulous and dared not act recklessly. When he summoned the officials, he referred to himself as "Yu" (I), not daring to call himself "Zhen" (I, emperor). When he appointed officials, he also added the character "Quan" (temporary), indicating that this was of a temporary nature. He sent people to welcome Song Kangwang, and himself pleaded: "The reason why I reluctantly followed the Jin people's establishment was to temporarily act expediently in order to alleviate the national crisis, and I dare not have any other intentions." It can be seen that Zhang Bangchang was not yet a traitor, and can only be said to be a confused puppet at best!

But Liu Yu was a thorough and complete traitor! Liu Yu's becoming a puppet was not the result of being pushed out by the Chu people, but the result of seeking and demanding it himself. He spent a lot of money and treasures to bribe the enemy, Talan. He acted as a fake emperor for eight years, not only without any sense of shame or scruples, but willingly acted as the enemy's dog, leading troops to invade the motherland several times. He can be said to have been extremely insane!

Zhang Bangchang and Liu Yu, these two treasonous fellows, did not have good endings in the end. Although Zhang Bangchang later returned to the Song Dynasty, rebellious and traitorous ministers are not tolerated by national law, and he was eventually赐死 (forced to commit suicide) by Song Gaozong. Liu Yu had the backing of the Jin Kingdom's powerful Talan and Nianhan, and was able to come to power; but later Talan and Niantu lost power. Once his backing collapsed, the traitor lost his support, and was finally deposed by his master (the Jin people). The Jin people imprisoned him in Jinming Pond, and the fake emperor became a prisoner. In the end, he died in the enemy country. The endings of these two puppet emperors were equally tragic, and can serve as a warning to current traitors!

### The Wonderful Use of Astrologers

— Fo

Japanese warlords have always used a kind of anesthetic method to encourage the people's ambition to invade. Therefore, things like "amulets" and "thousand-person stitches" are their supreme magic weapons for setting up Shintoism and fooling their people. The baseness and stupidity of this method are equivalent to the Empress Dowager Cixi's use of the "Boxer Rebellion," believing that guns and cannons cannot enter, and knives and fire cannot harm, which is equally ridiculous.

Recently, they have come up with a new idea and invented a new method of deceiving the public. According to Reuters yesterday, "Thirty astrologers in Tokyo have organized an association after being lectured by the police chief, and have decided that during this emergency period of war against China, they will encourage optimism among those who come to ask about the future." This base, vulgar and mediocre method is not only ridiculous, but also pathetic. With such a large Tokyo, only thirty astrologers are probably not enough to distribute, and if superstitious people come to ask about the future, the astrologers will just lie and say whatever they want. Assuming that the people of Tokyo do not come to ask about the future, then the astrologers will have no place to use their heroism, and cannot lie, so what to do? Here, I can also offer a supplementary method.

As long as the police chief issues an order: (1) All people living in Tokyo must go to an astrologer to ask about their future fortune, and those who do not go to an astrologer to ask about their future fortune will be considered to have reactionary ideas. (2) All people living in Tokyo, regardless of gender, age, or size, must carry a "fate chart" with them, just like the people in our country's guerrilla areas must have a "pass," "smallpox vaccination certificate," and "epidemic prevention certificate." If the people are inspected and they or their homes have no "fate chart," they can be accused of treason. In this way, the Japanese people's war-supporting ideology will have no way to develop, and can be fundamentally eradicated. Isn't this a wonderful method?

But the principle of astrologers is to "ask about disasters, not about blessings." Assuming that the Tokyo astrologers, according to the principles of astrologers, like "Zhang Tie Mouth" and "Li Tie Mouth," are equally honest, and present the truth, without any concealment, I am afraid that all the people of Tokyo will be shaken, and the gunpowder depots all over Japan will be as dangerous as the Osaka arsenal. Even if the astrologers can obey orders and follow instructions, but since the beginning of the war, for twenty months, prices have been rising day by day, the economy has been shrinking day by day, the population has been decreasing day by day, the number of widows has been increasing day by day, and the "honored" cemeteries of the fallen soldiers are everywhere, and the ashes of the warriors are continuously transported back from the warships. Under these circumstances, I think that these astrologers, no matter how eloquent they are, no matter how flowery their words are, the people of Tokyo will still not be able to believe them? Therefore, this kind of method only shows their hard work and clumsiness. Here, I see the Japanese warlords' boredom and messiness.

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

The streetlights were lit. The once bright light, in the hazy space, was no longer as bright as before.

It was at this moment that he came from a desolate street and walked into a basement bar. He stood in front of the long counter, crumpled a wad of banknotes into a small ball, and skillfully tossed it to the owner of the bar. He loudly called out:

"Hey, liquor!"

"Vodka?"

"Did you think it was champagne?"

Then, the bar owner gave him a glass of vodka, and a look of revulsion from the corner of his eye.

He indifferently took the glass, drank it in one gulp, and casually took a slice of sausage with his hand. Skillfully! He tossed it into his mouth, chewed it, and left.

The owner of the bar, with a strange and disgusted gaze, followed the back of this dissolute and unrefined customer.

After he left the bar, he let the warmth of the alcohol resist the cold outside: because under his fine clothes, he wore a cheap shirt and underpants—already dirty and torn: if someone discovered his discordant attire, it would become evidence of his guilt. Therefore, he deliberately walked slowly, controlling his impatient mood; and, he kept swinging his cane, breaking the complete snow surface on the pavement—showing a triumphant and leisurely expression after the hunt.

So, how could any detective, even with experienced eyes, prove that he was a secret messenger? (4)
