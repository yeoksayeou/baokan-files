### Intensifying Mobilization Efforts for Overseas Chinese Women

The great cause of resisting the war and building the nation is currently at a very critical stage. Whether the nation can achieve equality and independence, and whether the people can achieve liberation and happiness, depends entirely on whether our current resistance war can gain the strong support of the entire nation's vibrant strength. And whether the general mobilization of the entire nation's vibrant strength can be truly successful, the most important issue is whether the mobilization of women across the country is successful. Overseas Chinese women number in the tens of millions! If we can mobilize all overseas Chinese women to participate in the ×× national construction work, then the significance of this will be imaginable.

In the more than twenty months since the start of the war of resistance, enlightened elements of overseas Chinese women in various places have successively served for ×× national construction work, such as voluntarily returning to the country to participate in battlefield service, such as encouraging male overseas Chinese to leap to the front lines, such as working hard to accommodate and care for children, such as mobilizing, organizing, and educating refugees, soliciting donations to comfort the soldiers at the front and the refugees in their hometowns, such as enthusiastically participating in charity sales and donation drives, all of which have established considerable great achievements, adding much glory to overseas Chinese women. In the women's circles of Hong Kong, due to the leadership and efforts of advanced women, the achievements have been particularly admirable. Recently, the Guangzhou Young Women's Christian Association has moved its office to Hong Kong and is now organizing a women's service corps to return to the country. Their spirit of sacrifice and service for the nation and people is truly deeply appreciated. This spirit and action of overseas Chinese women in our country in sacrificing, serving, and fighting for the nation and people has not only made a great contribution to the cause of resisting the war and building the nation, establishing the foundation for future victory and success, but also opened up a bright and open future for the women's liberation movement itself, greatly enhancing the political status of women themselves and gradually realizing the improvement of their actual lives.

However, at the same time, we must recognize another fact, that is, the scope of overseas Chinese women's ×× national construction service in the past twenty months has been very narrow, and its effectiveness has been very weak, and the particularly serious phenomenon is that those who can recognize and strive to participate in the service are still limited to a small number of advanced enlightened intellectual women and a very small number of female workers. The vast majority of women from all walks of life and housewives have not yet been mobilized to participate in all the work of resisting the war and building the nation, let alone how to improve their initiative and enthusiasm, and the lack of talent among overseas Chinese women's movement cadres is the most important reason. Often because of the lack of such cadre talent, the women who have already been organized cannot earnestly and practically contribute their heart and strength to serve the nation and people, cannot consolidate and develop the power of women's masses united, as for the vast women's power abandoned outside the ×× national construction cause, and consumed in useless work and idleness, the situation is even more unbearable to imagine.

Therefore, the central task of our current effort to intensify the mobilization of overseas Chinese women is to train a large number of women's movement cadres. The first step is to widely and selflessly absorb those in overseas Chinese women who are loyal to the ×× national construction cause, have experience in national salvation work, and are trusted by the masses. We must absorb and select these people from all regions, all classes, all parties, and all professions. The second step is to establish various training organizations according to their temperament and interests. We must intensify the organization of battlefield service groups, wounded soldiers and refugee relief teams, and comfort teams for the families of soldiers going to war. We must serve in the motherland or go to the front lines. The first priority is to train personnel who are proficient in this work. We must quickly organize rear propaganda teams, mobilization promotion associations, children's nurseries, expand fundraising campaigns, first aid and poison prevention, ××××××, practice economy and expand production movements, and the first priority is to train a large number of cadre talents suitable for leading this work. In addition, while cultivating cadres for all overseas Chinese women's mobilization work, and when publicizing, organizing, and educating the vast number of women in order to expand overseas Chinese women's mobilization work, we should first enable them to acquire all the basic knowledge about ××, improve their political awareness, and improve their self-esteem and self-confidence; so that they have a full understanding of the united front, sustained ××, and final victory; secondly, we must constantly study the experience and lessons of the women's movement, especially the women's mobilization organization and education work, and constantly participate in all practical women's movements, and grow and unite in the process of combining theory and practice.

If overseas Chinese women can be mobilized in unison, they will surely generate great assistance to the great cause of ×× national construction and the national liberation movement; at the same time, they will show a very significant impetus for the women's liberation movement. Especially in this critical stage of ×× national construction, intensifying the mobilization of overseas Chinese women has become the central task of the current overseas Chinese women's movement. We hope that overseas Chinese women from all walks of life will recognize their important position and task in the current stage, and automatically and actively rise up and work hard. We also hope that the government and people from all walks of life will immediately provide practical and effective help in every appropriate way.

### The Youth National Salvation Corps in Southeastern Shanxi

[Changzhi Correspondent] The Youth National Salvation Corps of the Fifth Administrative District of Southeastern Shanxi was formally established on February 3. More than 80 representatives from all walks of life in the five districts attended, except for Fushan, representing more than 40,000 members, including different classes, beliefs, occupations, genders, and youth, united in spirit and gathered together.

He then encouraged the representatives attending the meeting to recognize the environment, recognize the important responsibility of the youth, and continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of the youth. The interests of China's resistance war and the interests of the youth masses themselves are inseparable. The youth must fight to the end for the cause of resisting the war and building the nation, and he also said that learning and work are also inseparable. The minds and bodies of the youth should be armed in the work, and some of the weaknesses of the youth, such as not being humble, impatient, and easily pessimistic and discouraged, should be thoroughly overcome. Finally, he hoped that the youth could call on the broad masses of youth to participate in the resistance war.

Then, Commander × of the ×th Column of the Death Squad and Security Commander of the ×th District spoke, hoping that the representatives attending the meeting: first, shouldered the task of uniting all the youth in Southeastern Shanxi; second, led and educated the broad youth; third, mobilized the youth to participate in the war; fourth, hoped that the conference would pass a perfect program and gradually put it into practice. Mr. Wei Keming, the representative of the Changzhi office of the Shangdang Central District of the Sacrifice League, hoped that the conference would discuss the youth work line and cultivate and strengthen the youth's strength. Comrade Yang Jue, the representative of the Southeastern Shanxi General Trade Union, mobilized workers, youth, and workers to unite. Comrade Huang Yuan, the representative of the ×th Route Army Work Group, raised the issues of youth unity, unified learning, etc. Comrade Yang of the Women's National Salvation Preparatory Committee hoped that the Youth National Salvation Corps could help women's work. In addition, the representatives of more than a dozen groups, such as the Third Regiment of the Salvation Guidance Team, the Third District Youth National Salvation Corps, the Fifth District Farmers' National Salvation Corps, the Fifth District Workers' National Salvation Corps, the Taihang Mountain Culture and Education Publishing House, the Taihang Mountain Art School, and the Taihang Mountain Branch of the Youth Journalists Association, all spoke, and they all explained in detail the issues of improving youth life, youth culture and education, uniting youth from all parties, and establishing a unified youth front.

Finally, the representative of the Preparatory Committee of the Southeastern Shanxi Youth National Salvation Federation expressed his opinions, hoping to earnestly discuss the issues of youth work and learning, how to enrich the National Salvation work, and suggested to the conference: first, to mobilize the youth to participate in the war in an organized and planned manner; second, to mobilize and expand the youth to participate in various training classes (military, political, cultural, etc.); third, to strengthen and expand the Youth National Salvation organization.

It also sent telegrams to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Commander Yan Wei, Deputy Commander Zhu Peng, and Commissioner Tan Rong to express their respect. It was not until 4:00 p.m., after reading the congratulatory telegrams from all parties to the conference, that the adjournment was announced satisfactorily.

### A Month of Hard Study: The Life of the Guilin Wartime Journalism Training Class Organized by the Southern Office of the Chinese Youth Journalists Association

— Fan Kang

Every day when the buglers lined up at the gate of the provincial government to prepare to lower the flag, we—the students of the Wartime Journalism Class—always had to pass here to rush to class. We paid attention to the national flag and saluted it, and with a feeling of joy, we passed through Zhonghua Street, which was filled with rain and muddy puddles. (The incessant rain could not suppress the sincere heart for learning.) We arrived at the dilapidated lecture hall in that central elementary school—but the activity of the young people made it full of life.

Mr. Qiu Jiang strained his body to busy himself with pumping up the hanging gas lamp. The clumsy actions of a complete amateur made people laugh. This was the first day of class. - On January 1st, Mr. Jiang Yi rushed to finish his lecture on "Interviewing" and set off for Chongqing that night. For the first few days, Mr. Changjiang came to class despite his illness. He talked about the suffering he had when he first became a reporter and had no way to learn, and we—we are really happy now.

The training class was originally scheduled to recruit only 60 students, but more than 200 people applied, so the enrollment was expanded to 100. But there were still nine people who were not admitted and asked to "audit". The class was too small to accommodate them. However, those admirable friends stood outside the door to listen to the lectures, and eventually they were accepted.

On the third day of class, a grand "Teacher-Student Friendship Meeting" was held. Everyone introduced themselves, and everyone laughed, but they were silently in awe. There was an elementary school teacher who ran from a village two or three miles away to listen to the lectures. There was one who served in a newspaper office in another place and took a month's leave for this purpose. There was also one who was one of the brave "Eight Hundred Warriors"...

Our school should thoroughly implement teacher-student cooperation. At the friendship meeting, we passed the class's proposal: to presume that all students participate in the class's work meeting, and based on the many valuable opinions submitted by the students to the class before the meeting, we decided to live in small groups and decided on extracurricular work: a work practice team, a library reference room, a symposium, etc.

The work practice team published the Freedom News, which was edited by each group in rotation. Every day at about 9:00 a.m., as soon as the Central News Agency's telegram arrived, this small room, which served as both an editorial office and a printing house, became active. The students began to work as if they were really doing something. The editor-in-chief gave the telegram a rough look and handed it over to the editors of each column, and he himself edited the main news and wrote editorials. The editors of each column were also busy deleting short telegrams and marking "headlines". Everyone puckered their mouths and skillfully used red ink, scissors, and paste... "We want to strive to publish at two o'clock." "Break the record of Group ×." With these words, everyone's spirits were even more invigorated, although their stomachs were already protesting. One person threw away his red pen and rushed to find a steel pen to start mimeographing. In this way, our group of editors changed their profession one after another and became printing workers. "How much does our mimeograph print per hour?" "One million copies." "Be careful, the stencil is broken." "Quick, add gauze." "Oops, only forty copies have been printed."... Until the evening when the work of newspaper vendors was finished, the praise or strict criticism of the Freedom News by the students and advanced comrades made the hard work of the day the greatest reward.

The first symposium was to bid farewell to Mr. Xia Yan and Mr. Changjiang. Mr. Xia Yan recounted how he was expelled from school and even had to flee to Shanghai because he ran a publication in middle school. Mr. Changjiang said, "Let the Freedom News bloom like a free flower in our remote villages and behind the enemy's lines." Yes, we have an excellent academic environment and should open up a greater career!

Our hard learning life was in such a common response, like a surging stream of hard work. Once, in a collective discussion after a lecture, a student supplemented a characteristic of Mr. Changjiang's lecture on "Journalism in the New Stage," that is, from simple propaganda and education to the function of organization, which was gladly accepted. After class, the students braved the wind and rain and spent long nights visiting the printing and editing departments of various newspapers, so that the students realized the hardship of journalism and the eagerness of advanced comrades for our expectations.

The days passed quickly, and a month was really too short. In order to connect feelings and continue learning, the organization of the alumni association was proposed and finally quickly organized.

On March 1st, the "last lesson" was given. When everyone was a little reluctant to say goodbye, Mr. Chen Nongfei proposed the suggestion of "holding a review meeting", which was immediately supported by the students. The next day. At the review meeting, we reviewed the learning life in the past month and enthusiastically pointed out many shortcomings, such as the unhealthy small group life. We are not afraid of shortcomings, we want to move forward in correcting shortcomings and overcoming mistakes. We are a group of young people.

On the fourth day of the graduation ceremony, many cultural figures and officials from party and government agencies came to give us instructions. That harmonious atmosphere was an unforgettable impression. Chairman Zhong Qisen said that the opening of this famous class was first of all thanks to the help of the Guangxi authorities and the many lecturers who were able to take time out of their busy schedules to teach. Here, what makes us all the more admirable is the old revolutionary veteran Mr. Li Renren. He came to give us a lecture on "Sun Yat-sen's Legacy" at the age of sixty. That day. He also came to give us earnest instructions, regarding us as heart-attacking warriors, hoping that we would intensify our efforts in the second anti-Japanese war, in which politics is more important than military affairs!

Yes, we should shoulder the responsibility of these "heart-attacking warriors". But for our loyal soldiers who use their flesh and blood to resist the strong ×'s attack on the city, we can't forget them for a moment. At the suggestion of the Alumni Association, each student paid a diploma fee of five dimes to donate to the "Friends of Wounded Soldiers Society".

Finally, that was such exciting news. Some of the students in the training class formed a battlefield journalism team. They planned to go deep into the interior to interview and carry out journalism work, which was undoubtedly a great harvest of the training class, which lasted only one month.

Carry forward the spirit of our hard study in the past month, students, the road ahead is even harder!

### Hengyang on the Xianggui Railway (Part 2) Friends of China in China (5)

— Ye Quesun

Li Meng was originally a talkative person who could speak well. Mr. Jingyi's question was like opening the lock of a chatterbox, and he continued to sing endlessly. Li Meng said:

In my three months in China, the first question my Chinese friends asked me was about France's Far East diplomatic policy, and especially about France's attitude towards China. Of course, this is by no means an ordinary casual question, but an expression full of friendship, hope, and passionate concern. At the same time, I believe that the special attention of the Chinese people to France's diplomatic attitude is by no means simply because France's Indochina has a close geographical connection with China. It is because France still retains the reputation of a free and independent motherland and the nurse of international psychology and democratic institutions. Therefore, although France has not yet provided China with much help, this firm trust has always remained deeply in the minds of every Chinese person. Therefore, standing in the position of a "Friend of China" and as a Frenchman who still has the glorious tradition of fighting for freedom and independence, it is necessary to explain France's Far East diplomatic policy to friends who are fighting for freedom, independence, world peace, and international justice. First of all, France's foreign policy must be linked to the international situation in recent years. Since Hitler climbed onto the German political stage in 1933, Europe has entered its unfortunate situation, and this unfortunate component is gradually increasing. The ambition to establish a German Empire has given the countries near Germany a constant threat, especially to France, which borders Germany, and many small countries in Central Europe that have good friendship with France. Since the establishment of the Rome-Berlin Axis, the rise of fascist forces has increased the infinite crisis in Europe. The first reaction of European democratic countries to the threat of fascist forces was to try to conclude a compromise Four-Power Pact with the aggressors in 1934. Due to the excessive ambitions and demands of the fascist countries, the so-called Four-Power Pact went bankrupt. For example, Germany wants to focus on free activities in Central and Eastern Europe, and Italy has special spheres of influence in the Mediterranean and North Africa. This historical fact shows how France has been busy dealing with disputes in Central Europe and North Africa. Moreover, the Saar incident, the annexation of Abyssinia, Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Tunisia, etc., this series of tragic historical events further proves how powerless France is.

When the Sino-Japanese War began, the crisis in Europe also increased unprecedentedly; the fascist forces attacked Spain even more fiercely, and the Nazi Party seized Czechoslovakia without hesitation. Therefore, we can note that the development of the Sino-Japanese War and the deepening of the European crisis are proceeding simultaneously. At the end of 1938, France had to concentrate its energy on the borders bordering Germany, Italy, Spain, and other places. This precisely shows that France's attention is in Europe. At the same time, although France clearly knows that the Japanese imperialists, the culprit in the Sino-Japanese War, are allies of German and Italian fascists, and the prolongation of the Sino-Japanese War is a great threat to the security of Indochina. However, France is unable to help strengthen Indochina's defense because it is unable to take care of itself in Europe. This is a fact that the Indochina government and people unanimously understand that if Japan were to defeat China, Indochina's fate would be very critical. This is why the Indochinese people unanimously sympathize with China's war of resistance and have restored the name "Chinese Uncle" to the Chinese. This is also a fact that it was not until the end of 1938 that Indochina received some help from France in increasing Indochina's defense capabilities. The above facts tell us why France has not given China more assistance so far.

In addition to the actual reason that the European situation is too tense for France to take care of other things, there are some other political reasons here. Since the dissolution of the French Popular Front government, the fascist forces within France have also been constantly strengthened. We know that fascist organizations or conservative parties sympathetic to fascism in the same country tend to favor Japan. Therefore, Japan used the help of French fascist forces to set up strict propaganda organs in Paris with a large amount of money to anesthetize French public opinion. Furthermore, French political figures have also been influenced by many remarks from a well-known Chinese politician (referring to Wang Jingwei). He repeatedly said: "China is a weak country, without mechanized and scientific troops, China has no way to resist... Therefore, the best way out for China is to make peace with Japan." This situation has caused a widespread feeling among French political circles: If China itself has no confidence in winning the war of resistance, then helping China is naturally a meaningless thing. Moreover, the international situation is so bad that France can only give China very limited help. At the same time, if China's situation is really as this politician said, then this small amount of help from France is not enough to increase its chances of victory. On the other hand, this small assistance to China is just enough to incur the hatred of the Japanese. This example can also explain France's attitude towards China to some extent.

However, I must also report on the general actual situation. Indeed, the majority of French public opinion has always stood on China's side. In detail, all progressive and left-wing political parties and popular organizations fully and firmly support China. Of course, if they can get more reports on the facts of China's heroic war of resistance, then this pure sympathy based on a sense of justice will inevitably develop further, and its impact will expand and strengthen accordingly. Another thing we must know is that the Japanese propaganda organization in France is very sound, and the Japanese are the most skilled smugglers in the world. Now they have applied various smuggling techniques to propaganda work; on the one hand, they are venting how barbaric China is, and on the other hand, they are desperately drumming up how Japan is fighting for Sino-Japanese friendship. But we understand very well that all this is just a self-deceiving trick with no factual basis. Most French people know that the Japanese propaganda work is just trying to cover up its crimes of massacring civilians and bombing undefended cities and villages in China. At the same time, we also know that the so-called "friendship" in the mouths of the Japanese is just to let Japan be China's "only friend." In other words, "The Far East is the Far East of the Far Eastern people, and Japan is the only master of the Far East." But China also has the best official propaganda office, which is the fact that it has been bravely resisting the war for nineteen months without any discount. Without the slightest exaggeration, in the war of resistance, China has achieved a very good diplomatic position in national defense. We can deeply believe that with the development of the Sino-Japanese War, the majority of public opinion in democratic countries that sympathize with China will promote the governments of various countries to adopt a more positive attitude towards the diplomatic policy in the Far East. Naturally, France will also have a new turning point.

There is another reason that can explain the possibility of a change in France's Far East policy. That is, the French government now has to understand that Japan's actions in the Far East are absolutely not enough to conquer China, but are enough to destroy the interests of foreigners in the Far East. Economically, the French government will naturally feel that Japan has begun to invade Indochina. The so-called "economic cooperation" that Japan used to deal with North China has now begun to be carried out in Indochina. The attempt to maintain friendly relations with Japan in the Far East is really no different from a dream. Moreover, the Indochina government has proposed to France more than once to find ways to clear Japanese spies within its borders. Originally, the French government thought that maintaining friendly relations with Japan was the best strategy to ensure the security of Indochina, but the facts tell us that when the Czech crisis was very serious and people all over the world were waiting for the arrival of World War II. Nine Japanese warships began to patrol around Weizhou Island and Paracel Islands and approached the Indochina coastline—there is no doubt that if the European war really breaks out; Japan will immediately land in Indochina. I believe that the lessons of these two facts will make the French government realize that the only way to ensure the security of Indochina and maintain the Nine-Power Treaty is to help China resist the war and defeat the common enemy, fascist Japan!

Following Li Meng's long speech, Mr. Jingyi and other friends in the political department put forward many opinions on how to deeply understand the actual situation in China for Li Meng to borrow. Mr. Zhang Xiawei, the deputy division commander of the XX division, also expressed some hopes for foreign friends and how to strive to promote the progressive combination of China and France.

This banquet full of international friendship, and a conversation a bit like the café outside the Geneva conference, came to an end. In fact, it was indeed not early, it was almost ten o'clock, and we had to hurry on the road early tomorrow morning!

Since the fall of Barcelona and Japan's landing on Hainan Island, France has fallen into a situation of being besieged on all sides. The ambitions of fascist aggressors have no end; Japan wants to "establish a new order in East Asia." Italy wants to satisfy his "natural wish," and Hitler threatens to "arm and distribute the natural wealth of the world." If it is said that this kind of ambition to gain an inch can be used to seek the moderation of Germany and Italy by means of retreat, then the Munich Conference will solve all problems. However, the facts tell us that it is not the case at all. In his parliamentary speech on January 30, Hitler not only advocated the redistribution of world territories and resources, but also openly expressed his support for Italy's aggression. Hitler's speech has greatly reduced the value of the so-called Anglo-German Declaration and the Franco-German Non-Aggression Declaration after the Munich Conference. In the past, Britain and France could be generous with others' interests and sacrifice the interests of third parties. Now there are no Austria, Czechoslovakia, Abyssinia... and other third parties that can be used by Britain and France as chickens to feed the wolves. Germany and Italy's attempt to redistribute world territories and resources has aroused direct and fierce struggles with Britain and France. Moreover, the problem is not limited to the Mediterranean, Western Europe, North Africa... but has spread to the Pacific, South America, and the entire world. May I ask if Mr. Chamberlain is still dreaming of the "stabilizing Europe" plan of four-power cooperation? Would he rather sacrifice the colonies that the British Empire relies on for survival, which he has seized with bloody hands? May I ask if Daladier and Bonnet want to send France, which has the glorious tradition of fighting for freedom and independence, to the guillotine, in addition to having already put fascist shackles on France's limbs! Stop dreaming of solving world problems with things like a new Washington Conference or a new Locarno Treaty. Fascist robbers have already put on a war pose and are attempting to redistribute the wealth and resources of the world with threats!

### Our Army Actively Strives for the Initiative, Changing from Defense to Offense on the North and South Lines

[Reuters, Chongqing, 11th] Well-informed sources claim that it is too early to say that the Chinese side has launched a general counteroffensive. Although the Chinese army has recently adopted counteroffensives in several areas, it is all to seek strategic advantages. At the same time, the Chinese side believes that the Japanese army will now take action, hoping to completely occupy the Yuehan Railway. It is believed that the Japanese army will concentrate its forces and attack the northern section of the railway in order to join forces with the Japanese army in Hubei and Jiangxi to attack Changsha, and then advance eastward and southward along the railway. It is said that the war situation in the Xijiang area has recently become tense due to the Japanese army in Sanshui attempting to detour to attack Wuzhou.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 11th] According to an official announcement here yesterday, China has adopted an offensive on all fronts, from Inner Mongolia in the north to Guangdong in the south, either already launched or about to be launched. According to the past 21 months of war, the Japanese army has always been in the initiative position. Now the Chinese army will take the offensive.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 11th] According to Japanese reports here, the Chinese army in southern Shanxi has recently launched a general offensive on all fronts, and there have been fierce battles.

Our Army Controls Gan and E

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 11th] The overall situation of the 11th is stable. In Jiangxi, we continue to attack Nanchang. The Xiangtang stronghold on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been recovered. The enemy is extremely panicked. The battle situation in Gaoan has intensified. We are still firmly defending the city of Gaoyou. The strongholds near Dacheng are all under our control. The attack towards Xiushui has made no progress.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 12th] According to news from the front line last night, the Chinese army in Jiangxi has gained a favorable counteroffensive. The Chinese troops on the east bank of the Gan River are advancing towards Nanchang, approaching the suburbs. The Japanese army has retreated into the area. The Chinese and Japanese armies on the west bank of the Gan River are in a stalemate between Gaoan and Fengxin. After the Chinese army in Hubei launched a counteroffensive on Saturday and Sunday, it has also made considerable progress. The Chinese army is now forming an arc-shaped formation to encircle Hankou. The front line starts from a certain place north of Yingshan, passes through Zhongxiang Jiukou to Yuejiakou, and is advancing towards Hankou. Several hills in this area have been recovered by the Chinese army. Yuejiakou has also been recovered, and Yingshan is surrounded by the Chinese army on three sides and can be attacked soon. The Japanese army on the highway between Zhongxiang Jiukou is also under fierce attack by the Chinese army. The Chinese side believes that the Japanese army in the area is weak, and most of the main forces have been transferred to Jiangxi to participate in the Battle of Nanchang.

Guangdong-South Seesaw Battle

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper, Chongqing, 11th] On the 8th, we captured Fuhexu in southern Guangdong and are approaching Zengcheng. Xin’hui and Jiangmen are in a seesaw battle. The enemy landed from Daxin Street and occupied Nantou. The entire city was destroyed by the enemy.

[Central News Agency, Sihui, 10th] Xinchang telephone, on the southern road of Xijiang, our army once recovered Jiangmen on the 7th, killing many enemies. The enemy then sent reinforcements by warship from along the river. Due to the disparity in strength and to avoid being cut off by the enemy, we automatically withdrew from the urban area of Jiangmen and moved to nearby high ground to defend. In addition, the remnants of the enemy besieged near Xinhui City have recently been resupplied and are苟延残喘， but they still cannot escape the encirclement. Our army occupies the high ground north of Xinhui City, strictly monitors and continues to mop up.

[Central News Agency, Sihui, 10th] After the battle for Baisha Bridge (near Guanyao) began, after our repeated assaults, the enemy's formation gradually became chaotic. On the morning of the 10th, the enemy urgently transferred hundreds of people from Zhushan to reinforce. Our army is still confronting the enemy in the Yuangang Baifengang area.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 10th] After we captured Xin Street, the enemy actively reinforced and counterattacked from the southeast for several days. On the 9th, the enemy on the railway front used many tanks to protect the team and attacked in large numbers, and used aircraft to fiercely attack and assist in the battle. We bravely fought back, and both sides advanced and retreated repeatedly. At dusk, some of the enemy retreated to our northeast, and at the same time intensively bombarded with heavy artillery, destroying all our fortifications, and then automatically transferred to the enemy's side.

[Central News Agency, Shiqi, 11th] In the gray morning, hundreds of enemy soldiers, three tanks, and more than 100 cavalrymen in Jiangmen attempted to retreat along the Jianghe Highway to Tangxia near Fenjiang, where they were ambushed by our army. The two sides fought fiercely. The enemy soldiers were unable to support themselves and suffered heavy casualties and retreated along the original road. The enemy then radioed to the enemy in Sanzao for help. Sanzao sent eight planes to Tangxia to偵察轰炸 our army's defense area, dropping more than 100 bombs. Dozens of civilian houses were destroyed. Our army was prepared, so the losses were minimal.

### Brave Company Commander Zhou: Fighting the Enemy with a Few, Never Retreating Until Death

[Central News Agency, Tongguan, 10th] Zhou Mingyi, the company commander of a certain unit of our army, led 30 soldiers on the 20th of last month. When passing through the bottom of Sujia Mountain from Fenyang, he found out that more than 1,000 enemy troops were going to Fenyang from Wucheng. The company commander set up an ambush at the bottom of Fengjia Mountain. He let the enemy's vanguard pass and waited for the main force to approach before using light machine guns to fiercely sweep the enemy's intensive team. The enemy vanguard heard the sound and folded back and attacked the company. The company was divided into three hilltops, forming a corner. The enemy attacked several times, and the firepower of the guns and cannons was dense, and it was difficult to approach. From noon to Shen, the company commander calmly commanded, fought bravely, and fought fiercely for 17 hours. The ammunition was exhausted and trapped in heavy siege. The company commander was seriously injured and still held the only remaining grenade in his hand. When dozens of enemy soldiers reached the nearest distance, the company commander pulled the grenade and died with the enemy, making a heroic sacrifice. Five soldiers died at the same time. More than 20 people broke through. In this battle, more than 100 enemies were killed. The company commander fought the enemy with a few and never retreated until death. The spirit of loyalty, bravery, and righteousness is worthy of praise from the military and civilians of the whole country. It is heard that the government will give preferential treatment.

This move gave the enemy in southern Shanxi a major blow.

[Ming Ge News Agency, Xiangning, 11th] On the 5th, a part of the enemy in Wanquan joined more than 100 imperial collaborative troops and collected civilians in the area of Jiexian to repair the highway from Wanquan Xinji to Jishan.

### The Murder of a Secretary of the Puppet Shanghai Public Security Bureau, Xi Shitai; Stray Bullets Injure Police and Pedestrians; Rumor of an Assassin Wounded and Arrested

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 11th] Shanghai dispatch: Xi Shitai, doctor and secretary-director of the puppet Public Security Bureau, who had a Japanese wife, was assassinated at 9:30 a.m. on the 11th in front of his residence on Lloyd Road in the International Settlement. It is said that two or three people opened fire, one of whom was wounded and arrested. Two police officers and two pedestrians were also injured by stray bullets.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 11th] It is learned that the puppet Weixin government official, Mr. Xi, who was shot and killed this morning, had just arrived from Japan. He was accompanied by his Japanese wife when he was attacked, but his wife was not injured. When the assassination occurred, a Chinese detective heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene, but was also shot and wounded in the arm. It is said that the police authorities will use the Chinese detective's gunshot wound as a clue to investigate the case.

Wang Kemin's Speech After Cheng Xigeng's Assassination

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 11th] Tianjin dispatch: Cheng Xigeng, the traitorous manager of the puppet Joint Reserve Bank's Tianjin branch and concurrent superintendent of the puppet Tianjin Customs, was shot and killed on the evening of the 9th at the Daguangming Theater in the British Concession. The bullet hit a vital point, killing him instantly. Cheng was watching a talkie with his concubine, and when there was a loud gunshot in the film, the brave man also opened fire. The audience and police officers were unaware, and the assailant calmly escaped after the act. Cheng was 47 years old this year and a native of Jiangsu. He was a student who studied in England. His wife was the youngest daughter of Gao Erqian. He recently succeeded Wen Shizhen as the superintendent of the puppet Tianjin Customs. After Cheng's death, Wang Kemin made a speech in Ping, filled with a sense of "the rabbit mourns for the fox's death."

[Reuters, Shanghai, 11th] A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy met with reporters this afternoon and said that the assassination of Weixin government official Xi Shitai was clearly a premeditated assassination. The Japanese authorities attach great importance to this matter.

### Wu Zhihui's Article: A Vehement Condemnation of Wang Jingwei (Continued from yesterday)

At that time, I saw Wang's appearance after the fall of Guangzhou, as if he had lost his parents, which was quite enough to wail and howl. I thought that Wang would not avenge this hatred against [Japanese] for the sake of the country, and would be awakened to the plight of his ancestors. Little did I know that he was regretting that he was too late to "bend the knee" like Teng. The learning of great figures is truly beyond the comprehension of the lowly like us. Perhaps he deeply believed that a Czechoslovakia after the division of the "Suhe District" could be stable and prosperous for a long time, so he also made it known as a national policy. Our China had no choice but to obtain final victory, so many important points from Beijing to Wuhan were sacrificed with pain in order to exhaust the [Japanese] and make them eager to induce peace and want us to stop fighting and rest with them. Our officers and soldiers at the front and compatriots throughout the country are seeking real life in the midst of death. The real policy of protracted resistance has just reached a turning point, but Wang has forgotten it. On the contrary, he thinks that the more [Japanese] occupy our cities and the more cruelly they kill our compatriots, the faster we should surrender to the [Japanese] and the more harsh the conditions we should accept. Are you making such mad words to support the [Japanese] or to bargain with our own country on behalf of [Japanese]? With such a psychology of fearing the fierce and fearing the [Japanese], it is no wonder that you are afraid of [Japanese] bombing Chongqing and want to fly to the safe zone in Hanoi abroad, hurriedly responding to [Japanese] Prime Minister Konoe's establishment of a "New Order in East Asia" with "national subjugation conditions." You are actually going to send up the chance for the [Japanese] to be exhausted, which we have fought for at the cost of the lives of our entire nation, to seek peace with the [Japanese], so that they can rest and recuperate. After the armistice, the [Japanese] will rest for half a year, and when our people are disheartened and our military power is slack, they will come to sweep through our southwest again, wouldn't it be ten times easier than today? After such half a year, wouldn't the whole of China become Czechoslovakia, and you would organize a "central government," wouldn't you also become the President Hacha of the defunct Czechoslovakia? This is something even elementary school students understand, but the Wang couple pretend not to understand. If you want people to explain, the reason is nothing more than envy of Puyi, Yin Rugeng, Hacha, etc. Although they are nominally puppets, they are third-class slaves. The ambitious people of the three northeastern provinces would rather be displaced north and south to this day, knowing that it is more difficult to be loyal subjects of a protected country than to be slaves of a conquered nation. Therefore, the Wang couple want to persuade [Japanese] business circles and young students, I believe [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper] will never want to follow Wang to Nanjing to be obedient subjects, because as soon as he encounters compatriots who have escaped from the three northeastern provinces and the occupied areas, and slightly mentions the little flavors of "bowing" and "slaps," he cannot help but hope to take advantage of the [Japanese] exhaustion, fight to the end, and seek escape from death.

(3) Wang's "example" contains three questions. The above explanations are enough to answer the first two questions. The third question is: "When German Ambassador Trautmann mediated, the people at the Supreme National Defense Council, whether in Nanjing or Wuhan, had the same views. Why would their views differ when Konoe made his statement?" I didn't expect that a person as intelligent as Wang would ask such a foolish question. Before I answer you directly, let me ask you first, why Wu Zhihui, the one from a county, always wanted to respect you and value you. When Li Shizeng and others begged you to be cautious about taking the lead on the first, second, and third of April in the sixteenth year, you suddenly issued a declaration with Mr. Chen Duxiu, the then leader of the Communist Party, on the fourth. I then unceremoniously scolded you madly. Later, you finally realized your mistake, and you think that it was a big mistake. Whether it was a big mistake or not, or whether it was your oversensitivity, but your self-awareness of the mistake at that time was indeed correct, so I respected you as before. By December of that year, you suddenly issued a fallacy again, and I and Mr. Li Shizeng and Zhang Puquan persuaded you to be cautious. Mr. Zhang even begged you, but you didn't say anything. When Guangzhou was burned and killed on the twelfth, I had no choice but to scold you again. You left the country in tears. Later, you felt that "Although I did not kill Boren, Boren died because of me," and you turned around and returned to put the Party and the country first. I respected you, and I have done so until now. I didn't expect that you are really a "political prostitute" and a "shaking element" criticized by the Communist Party, and you have come up with another alluring telegram. Naturally, how can we agree with your proposal of surrender? Mr. Zhang even regretted that he should not have risked holding the assassin in front of the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing to save a useless person. The above history answers your question of why people agreed with you before and why people disagree with you now. It is all natural. If you really go to be a puppet, I am afraid that your promising children [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper], so your confidential secretary, your most trusted comrade, because of his conscience, actually leaked your secrets. We truly feel sorry for Comrade Zeng Zhongming, because we have lost a truly loyal comrade who worked for the public and not for personal gain. Let me answer you directly again. You are using rogue rhetoric to hypnotize people with ugly tricks and falsely accuse them, saying that "Since we have advocated war, we should not advocate peace." Who said that advocating war should not advocate peace again? Who said that peaceful reconciliation is not a major national plan? But Mr. Wang must know that the peace you are talking about is seeking peace on the condition that you recognize Konoe's "establishment of a New Order in East Asia" on December 22nd last year. Don't you know that this "New Order in East Asia" is the "Japanese Bullet" and the "Japanese-Manchurian-Chinese Cooperative Body," and is it not a new term for "Japan's annexation of China"? Isn't this condition still a "condition for national subjugation"? Is your advocating peace like this not surrendering? Can it still be called negotiating peace? Can such submission still be called a major national plan? Is such a reconciliation not [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper]? Is it any wonder that people disagree with your proposal to surrender in this way and [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper]? Even elementary school students can distinguish between right and wrong, advantages and disadvantages, war and peace, survival and death. How can such an intelligent person like you not really know? Are you still distinguishing between peace and no peace, talking about the dreams of a fool, what is the purpose if not another one? Speaking of the main text, you must understand that if you are sincerely seeking the country and using proper procedures, such as the Supreme National Defense Council, to secretly contribute to the issue of peace and war, people will naturally discuss with you. If they find something inappropriate, they cannot deny it, as the non-mention of the Nanjing peace talks demonstrates. If your alluring telegram was personally delivered by you to the Party Headquarters for discussion by everyone, everyone would at most advise you not to dream foolishly and veto it. But you publicly went on a trip and publicly announced it, for malicious propaganda, you [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper]. People are pure, people are loyal and love their country, who would agree with your rebellious plot? Isn't your question of why "they would disagree again" foolish? The above is my further explanation, and it can be considered concise. But I hope that Mr. Wang will rein himself in at the edge of the cliff. There are still a few small questions that I would like to advise him on loyally.

(A) Some people say that Wang's publication this time only "gives one example" and has two other intentions (1) is what our friend heard Mrs. He Hua instructing "comrades" that day, she said, "If we want to reach the moon, we must first create a situation where the issue of war and peace can be openly discussed, and at least the issue of peace can be discussed as freely as the issue of war. Now the time has come, so Wang launched the first large cannon to try to cause agreement or rebuttal, causing a complete mess, trying to shake people's hearts and undermine the resistance. It makes [Japanese] laugh, but the Wang couple dare to commit such a [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper] crime, and will surely arouse boundless public outrage. I think that besides your colleagues like Wang Liang, who else in China would believe this [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper] propaganda and be swayed by you? You are just announcing your own [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper]. As for the rebuttal of playing the lute to a cow, I know that no one wants to defile their stinking hair. I am taking the liberty as a personal relative to make a final contribution. Mr. Wang, I think you believe in [Japanese] and do not believe in friends. You think it is true that [Japanese] does not recognize the National Government as an opponent. That's why you believe [Japanese] only want you, Wang, to be their peace-talking opponent. Therefore, you still superficially say what, if Japan negotiates peace with the National Government, you can assist from the sidelines in a private capacity. These polite words, I ask you, if you do not defect to [Japanese], what qualifications do you have to say? You can advise [Japanese] to negotiate peace with the government of this country? I believe that you are still dreaming this dream and have not awakened. You still think that [Japanese] only recognize you as an opponent is true and not deceiving you, so you are still calm and generous, very polite and very humble, to advise [Japanese] to treat the National Government as an opponent. But you yourself ask what is inside you, what medicine are you selling in your gourd? Honestly, without being polite, let me expose your charade. The content is that when the time is right, you will impolitely come out and say, now the country has been messed up by you irresponsible, insincere, and clueless [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper], you should get out of the way and let me do it. On the one hand, you pretend to be compassionate and say, "Since Japan does not want the National Government to come out as an opponent, and the National Government is too embarrassed to ask Japan for peace, then in the end only I, Wang Jingwei, have no choice but to come out to save the country and be Japan's opponent," under Konoe's so-called "New Order in East Asia," you will jointly complete the great undertaking of the "cooperative body" of Japan, Manchuria, and China. Isn't that your couple's plan? This is not what my friend is saying blindly, and it is not me joking. In your statement on the ninth, you still want to defend yourself against the news carried by the Dagong Daily on the fifth about your [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper], and refuse to admit it, but the materials and evidence I have obtained are more detailed than what the Dagong Daily wrote. If a lawsuit is filed, I will have to go to court and provide real evidence to prove it. At that time, you will have nothing to say? Stop.

(To be continued)

### The People's Armed Forces of Zhongtiao Mountain

— Jin Zaiyong

[Special Correspondent in Southern Shanxi] Both north and south of Zhongtiao Mountain are bases for extensive people's armed forces, where they are naturally not under the rule of the Japanese. The people's armed forces with the greatest influence are the Red Spear Society, the Self-Defense Forces, and some guerrilla groups.

In the so-called "interlocked" areas of confrontation between [Japanese] and us, the people's armed forces are growing there. They are growing and strengthening day by day, and they have the strength to fight against the Japanese army. The reporter recently went there, and now I will give a brief report on the situation there.

Now let's talk about the Red Spear Society in the north and south of Zhongtiao Mountain first. The Red Spear Society is a superstitious organization, but it is very common in the north and south of Zhongtiao Mountain. In the south of Zhongtiao, it is distributed in six villages. Those villages are only two li away from the [Japanese] position at the closest, and about five li at the farthest. They form a large encirclement of the [Japanese] position. In the past, the [Japanese] adopted a policy of appeasement, but these people did not listen to his tricks and often went out at night to cut power lines or attack [Japanese] cavalry. Therefore, the [Japanese] have been besieging these armed forces. There have been three battles. The first battle was on February 13th. Under the Jieguan, the [Japanese] suffered more than ten casualties, and the Red Spear Society members also suffered more than ten casualties. The second battle was on March 11th. This time, due to the negligence of the guards, the [Japanese] sneaked into the village at night. At that time, the Red Spear Society crowd resisted at the stronghold while covering the old and weak to retreat to the mountains. They fought from midnight to dawn. As a result, the [Japanese] entered the village, but got nothing, and the Red Spear Society members were unharmed. In anger, the [Japanese] killed six old men who were left in the village and could not move, and then retreated. The third time was on the evening of March 20th. The [Japanese] came again, but the people had learned two lessons, and this time the defense was more strict. As a result, the [Japanese] had to retreat.

The weapons of the Red Spear Society in that area are mostly knives and spears. There are not many guns. Now the [Nationalist] army stationed in the area has promised to provide them with assistance, and I think it will gradually expand.

The Red Spear Society in the north of Zhongtiao Mountain is slightly different from that in the south. Although they are organizations under the same system, they have changed their approach to dealing with the [Japanese] to a "pro-preparation" stance. The reason they do this is because they have the following shortcomings: First, they have no guns, only some knives and spears; second, the newly established organization has not yet achieved good unity among the people; third, some people are still afraid of the [Japanese]. Therefore, they adopt a compromise attitude with the [Japanese]. But this organization is huge. Now there are such organizations in Xia County, Wenxi, and Anyi areas in the north of Zhongtiao Mountain.

The attitude of the [Japanese] towards the Red Spear Society also differs between the north and south of the mountain. In the Pingmu area in the south of the mountain, a policy of non-cooperation is adopted. Of course, they cannot completely eliminate all the Red Spear Society in the south of the mountain, but they use intimidation methods and fire artillery shells into the villages from the artillery positions every day. However, recently, this policy of intimidation has also stopped being used, and the current situation is one of confrontation. As for the north of the mountain, it is another face. They are in contact with the leaders of the Red Spear Society. Anyone with the symbols of the Red Spear Society can enter the city freely without any trouble. For example, on March 10th, the puppet organization of Xia County performed a play, and the Red Spear Society of Xiaolv Village, ten li away from Xia County, entered the city with all their weapons to watch.

According to the investigation, the Red Spear Society in the north and south of Zhongtiao Mountain has recently grown to 70,000 to 80,000 people, divided into five Dao gates: Qianmen, Kanmen, Baishantang, Heidaomen, and Qianshunhui. Each Dao gate has a general association, and each general association has recently tended to unite to form a general organization. This is a huge force, and we should use the correct policies to win it over to avoid being exploited by the [Japanese] appeasement policy.

Secondly, we talk about the Self-Defense Forces, which are non-detached people's armed organizations. The difference between them and the Red Spear Society is that the Red Spear Society is a superstitious group, while the Self-Defense Forces are not. These groups often cooperate with the Red Spear Society and our army in combat, and they are very effective.

In the Pinglu, Ruicheng, and Yuanqu areas in the south of the mountain, most of them are spontaneous organizations of the people, except for those organized by the political departments of the garrison troops. They are well-equipped with weapons. For example, the Self-Defense Forces in Fengbo Village, Pinglu, have light machine guns. As for bombs, they can mostly make their own. Day and night, they send out team members to stand guard in front of the village, questioning pedestrians with suspicious movements, fulfilling the greatest task of maintaining public security.

It is more difficult to organize Self-Defense Forces in the north of the mountain, but under the unreasonable oppression of the [Japanese] army, many people have also risen up to call for it. Those wealthy families are willing to take out their own money to buy guns and organize them. As far as I know, Ren Yuyao, the district chief of the third district of Xia County, took his own money to the [Nationalist] army stationed there to buy the eight-shot pistols they helped manufacture, and established an armed people's work team to work in the occupied areas. These work team members are all young people, and each of them has a gun. It is said that the guns were left by the Xia County government. Now the work has been carried out well.

Their guns are all short guns, and they don't want rifles even if they are given to them. This is because short guns are easy to store. When a large [Japanese] army comes, they hide all the guns and are very docile and good people. But when a small [Japanese] army goes there, they are sure to be completely eliminated. Therefore, the [Japanese] army now does not dare to go to the countryside with fewer than two or three hundred people. It is not easy for teams of less than one hundred people to return to the city after going to the countryside.

Third, the guerrilla groups in the north and south of Zhongtiao Mountain were not affiliated with each other in the past. They were scattered in the Pinglu, Ruicheng, Xia County, and Anyi areas. Now the [Nationalist] army in Zhongtiao Mountain has established a six-county guerrilla headquarters, which has linked up those guerrilla groups that had no contact. In addition, the Eighth Route Army also has a guerrilla detachment in [location unreadable due to marks on original newspaper], which has now developed to [location unreadable due to marks on original newspaper]. The task of these guerrilla groups is to destroy railways and highways, and eliminate small [Japanese] units. The [Japanese] are most afraid of these elusive teams.

As for the guerrilla groups sent out by the regular army, there is a detachment of the [Nationalist] Army Corps, a detachment of the [Nationalist] Army, two regiments of the [Nationalist] Army, and a detachment of the [Nationalist] Army, which are active in the southwestern Shanxi area.

The [Japanese] are now using a policy of appeasement to deal with the people. In many places, they no longer burn or kill, and they also engage in public buying and selling. They lend livestock to the people to till the land (according to a report from the 28th Army Corps). They do their best to deceive the people. The "New People's Song" they compiled says, "China's sacred way for thousands of years, the New Democracy pervades the universe, loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness are all virtues, and heaven's law and human feelings are all complete. It is not difficult to use it to govern the country; everyone rises up to shoulder the burden together, and it is the responsibility assigned by heaven. The road to peace is in sight, the new people must abandon old habits, the most important thing is to wash their hearts and renew their faces, loyalty to the country and love for the people will show the true path, do not fail the talents given by heaven. Heretical theories should be [portion unreadable due to marks on original newspaper], never let them be spread again, and then the land of happiness will be seen before your eyes, and you will share happiness and peace." Those with outdated minds will also be deceived by these ghost words. As for the guerrilla groups, they are extremely hated, and the Eighth Route Army is cursed to the extreme. The leaflet "Mourning the Eighth Route Army" says "The Eighth Route Army's guerrillas are vulnerable to a single blow," but from this, one can also see that the [Japanese] are feeling guilty.

The people's armed forces in the north and south of Zhongtiao Mountain are the greatest force for us to restore southern Shanxi. At the same time, from this, we can prove that no matter what the [Japanese] do, they cannot rule our vast countryside.

### British Emergency Alert in the Mediterranean: All Ships Ordered to Leave Italian Waters. Greece and Turkey to Join Peace Front

[Associated Press, Athens, April 11] It is reported that twelve British and French warships, totaling about eight tons, are currently patrolling off the coast of Corfu. However, the British Naval Headquarters stated that it has not received any information about British ships approaching Corfu.

[Associated Press, London, April 10] An Associated Press correspondent stationed in Athens reported today via telegraph that several British warships have entered the port of Agistri. The correspondent's report was incomplete, as the telephone line was cut off by the Athens switchboard. The "Daily Mail" reported that the British Navy in Gibraltar has been ordered to prepare to depart within four hours. They are all prepared for combat. Gas masks and steel armor have been distributed. Officials stated that these measures are of a precautionary nature.

[Associated Press, Malta, April 10] Air raid and border defense exercises are currently being held here. Officials declared that this is a precautionary action. Personnel from the Mediterranean Fleet and the Royal Air Force have been ordered to return to their ships for duty. Simultaneously, the fleets are ready to depart on short notice.

[Reuters, London, April 10] All British Mediterranean Fleet ships that were visiting Italian ports left Italy on April 8, including the flagship "Warspite," the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, which departed from San Remo.

It is only said that in light of the current tense situation between Italy and Albania, it seems appropriate for the ships to temporarily leave Italian waters to avoid misunderstandings.

[Associated Press, London, April 11] The British Admiralty has denied reports from Cairo that the British Mediterranean Fleet arrived in Alexandria on Wednesday. The Admiralty stated that it is currently unable to disclose the whereabouts of the fleet.

British-Italian Relations: Temporarily Avoiding the Termination of the Agreement, Will Assist Greece in Defending its Borders

[Associated Press, London, April 10] The British Navy has taken emergency precautionary steps in the Mediterranean. It is rumored that Chamberlain will announce on Thursday when the House of Commons reconvenes that Greece and Turkey have joined the European Peace Front. The Prime Minister has ordered all air force officers on leave to return to duty and has ordered all ships to leave Italian waters and convene Parliament. After news spread that Italian troops were advancing towards Greece and Turkey through Albania, all parties were deeply concerned that the Fascists would take the opportunity to invade the Balkan countries. The British Cabinet has decided to temporarily avoid announcing the termination of the British-Italian Agreement, so that British-Italian relations would not be further severed. Moreover, since Franco expressed his closeness to the Axis policy, the future of the Spanish Republican government is also particularly bleak. This is also one of the reasons why the British government is disregarding the sudden abandonment of the British-Italian Agreement. As for Britain's attitude towards Greece, if Italy takes any action that threatens Britain's lines of communication, Britain will assist Greece in defending its borders. It is rumored that Britain has expressed this position to Italy through diplomatic channels. It is reported that Britain's guarantee to Greece is specifically aimed at preventing important islands such as Corfu from falling into the hands of authoritarian countries. However, the British Foreign Office has denied that the government has warned Italy not to attack Corfu and stated that such a move would lead to war.

[London, April 10] Foreign News: Britain and Italy have not taken any action against Mussolini in the Adriatic and Mediterranean Seas. However, London is actively engaged in diplomatic consultations to obtain Greece's consent so that the British Navy can use the island of Corfu as a base. London prefers to use diplomatic arrangements to utilize Corfu Island rather than openly occupying it. This arrangement will become part of the British-Greek guarantee, meaning that Britain can continue to station troops on the island to prepare to resist Italy's attempt to invade the island. British diplomacy is more focused on maintaining the balance of power at the entrance of the Adriatic Sea in order to maintain strategic necessities. Britain and France are currently engaged in closer cooperation with the Soviet Union and the Balkan countries. It is expected that the alliance between the Soviet Union and Turkey will be sufficient to control the Black Sea and the Dardanelles, regardless of future changes in Romania. At the same time, although Romania and Poland do not want to join forces, military cooperation between the Soviet Union and Greece is sufficient to resist joint Italian-Bulgarian actions in the Aegean Sea to seize an outlet to the sea for Bulgaria.

British Parliament: Both Houses Scheduled to Reconvene Tomorrow. Greek Government Anxious and Uneasy

[Reuters, London, April 10] A Reuters parliamentary correspondent stated that the report circulating tonight that Britain is giving guarantees to Greece does not fully correspond to the facts. The situation after the cabinet dinner tonight has changed slightly from before. The cabinet is currently considering the necessary steps to indicate that Greece's position (including Corfu) has not been threatened after Italy's occupation of Albania. It is reported that the views held by the cabinet members all recognize that the current situation in the eastern Mediterranean is absolutely not suitable for any disturbance. It is believed that the British side has conveyed this fact to Italy. All of this, Britain is still working closely with France. At the same time, the British Cabinet's decision not to meet again within two days is sufficient to indicate that the current situation still requires a great deal of contact and investigation before the truth can be obtained, pending a report to both houses on Thursday (April 13).

[Reuters, London, April 10] Both houses of the British Parliament are scheduled to reconvene on April 13, but it is reported that the session will not exceed one day.

[Reuters, London, April 10] This morning, while the cabinet was meeting, the Greek and Romanian ambassadors visited the Foreign Office. The Romanian ambassador revisited the Foreign Office in the afternoon, while the Charge d'Affaires was present. Labour opposition leader Attlee had a long conversation with Chamberlain for forty-five minutes on Downing Street.

[London, April 10] Foreign News: During today's special cabinet meeting in Britain, the issue of providing guarantees to Greece and the possibility of Britain sending ships to Greek ports if Greece deems it necessary will be the focus of discussion. The reason for the cabinet's meeting at the headquarters of the British Imperial Defence Committee is also in preparation for this action. The Greek government has informed the government of its anxiety about the approximately 150-mile border connecting it to Albania, especially its concern about the status of the island of Corfu, which is at risk of being attacked by Albanian mountain artillery. Political circles believe that Britain's guarantee of Greece's security should include dispatching British ships to Corfu and being prepared to land there at any time as the basis for the guarantee to Greece. The Admiralty has also canceled its Easter weekend warship visit to the Mediterranean Sea due to this.

### Britain to Change Policy on Palestine. Proposing Suggestions for a Quick Resolution. May Concede to Arabs

[Reuters, Cairo, April 11] It is expected that Britain will make an important announcement regarding its policy on Palestine. According to reliable sources, the Egyptian Ambassador to Britain is carrying British suggestions for a quick resolution of the Palestinian issue and will arrive here today. British Ambassador to Egypt Sir Miles Lampson has met with the Egyptian Prime Minister several times during the Easter period. It is reported that he has indicated that Egypt may be able to mediate the Palestinian dispute. As for the details of the British suggestions, they are currently unknown. It is rumored that Britain may make some concessions to the Arabs.

### British King and Queen to Change to Mail Ship for Canada Trip

[Haitong News Agency, London, April 11] According to the "Yorkshire Post," the British King and Queen originally planned to travel to Canada on a warship, but now they have changed to a mail ship. It is rumored that this sudden change is due to the tense international situation, and the warships have been dispatched for other duties and cannot be used for royal travel.

### Dutch Neutrality: Polish Alert Remains

[Reuters, The Hague, April 11] Dutch Prime Minister Colijn gave a speech in the square today, stating that the Netherlands will do its best to maintain neutrality under any circumstances. He declared that the alert taken at the border yesterday was to maintain neutrality and does not indicate that the country is under any direct threat. The country currently has very close friendships with all countries. Therefore, these preparations can only increase vigilance. "We do not harbor any hostile intentions. We only want to express that the Netherlands, under any circumstances, will maintain independence and neutrality." It is generally believed that the government is afraid of foreign threats, which is inaccurate. The current alert action is entirely due to the evolution of the European situation. These measures will be maintained until stability is fully restored. At the same time, the Netherlands should work as usual and not panic.

[Associated Press, The Hague, April 10] The Dutch government has ordered the conscription of multiple army corps to begin border reinforcements. The reason for this action has not been officially announced.

[Associated Press, Brussels, April 10] Several travelers have denied reports circulating about German troop movements on the Belgian border. The Belgian government has not taken any military alert actions at this time.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, April 11] It is reported that unless the general situation in Europe becomes peaceful, the government will not immediately order the demobilization of conscripted reservists. Poland will continue to take various military precautions without any negligence.

### British Prime Minister Chamberlain Responds to Mussolini

[Haitong News Agency, London, April 11] According to rumors circulating in political circles here last night, British Prime Minister Chamberlain sent a personal letter to Mussolini in response to the Italian Prime Minister's message on Sunday.

### Italian Anti-French Movement: Revived. Fabricating Reports of Maltreatment of Italian Nationals. Gayda Writes Article Attacking the United States

[Associated Press, Rome, April 10] According to observations in diplomatic circles here, the anti-French movement in Italy may soon be revived, as Fascist officials have published a large number of reports from Tunisia claiming that Italian nationals there have been severely mistreated and that France is working to create hatred towards Italians.

[Associated Press, Rome, April 10] Gayda today wrote an article criticizing the United States for condemning Italy's invasion of Albania. He asked that "the United States should mind its own business and not interfere in European affairs. The United States has not gained protection because of its distance."

### U.S. Aid to Democratic Countries. Proposed Huge Plan to Exchange Raw Materials. Establish Wartime Strength of Various Countries. Discussion of Neutrality Law to Be Completed

[Reuters, Washington, April 11] Senator Byrnes has proposed a large-scale international raw material exchange plan, the purpose of which is twofold: one is to establish the wartime strength of various democratic countries, and the other is to solve the difficulties caused by the U.S.'s surplus agricultural products. It is said that the United States can exchange cotton and wheat with the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, and several other countries for rubber and tin. The plan has been approved by the Department of Agriculture and is supported by several influential figures in the Senate. Byrnes declared yesterday that the State Department will formally propose transactions of several large quantities to foreign governments within a few days. The Army and Navy Departments advocate that the rubber storage capacity should be at least 226,000 tons. If proper protection is desired, 125 million pounds of rubber are needed. There have already been requests to store tin worth $65 million. According to Byrnes' estimates, the government currently holds 11 million bales of cotton as collateral for loans to farmers. At least 2 million bales of cotton can be used for this international raw material exchange plan.

[Washington, April 10] Regarding the investigation of the Neutrality Act, the government-supporting faction in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee stated that they believe that the number of Americans supporting the democratic countries to stop the authoritarian countries is gradually increasing as events unfold. They hope that the investigation will extend to the third week. Previously, Baruch's statement that there is no possibility of true neutrality has been widely accepted. Therefore, everyone is willing to provide financial assistance to non-aggressive countries for the sake of promoting the interests of the United States itself. According to reports, the true intention of this investigation is to make the isolationists understand that this move is highly likely and will not increase the risk of war. It is generally believed that senators who support supplying food to the United Kingdom and France account for 82 percent, while those who support supplying them with military supplies account for 66 percent.

[Washington, April 10] While President Roosevelt was on a ten-day trip, the Axis countries repeatedly stirred up trouble, and Albania fell into destruction, causing the White House spokesman to feel that the progress of the authoritarian countries was sufficient to reduce the United States' political security and economic prosperity. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has completed 50% of the discussion procedure for the Neutrality Act, which expires next month. In the future, the recommendations of the two committees on the Neutrality Act and the final agreement between President Roosevelt and Congress on this matter will be as important as any policy in the New Deal in the past six years.

[Reuters, Washington, April 11] President Roosevelt returned here from the hot springs yesterday and immediately met with Secretary of State Hull and Treasury Secretary Morgenthau in the car. It is reported that the discussion was about the European situation.

[Central News Agency, Washington, April 10] Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently met with reporters and said that given the international situation, there is no need to revise the currency agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the United States.

### U.S. Naval and Air Base Act Approved by the Maritime Committee

[Reuters, Washington, April 10] The Senate Naval Affairs Committee has approved the $65 million Naval Air Base Act after rejecting the suggestion to improve the Guam plan. The House of Representatives had already rejected the Guam plan earlier.

### French Cabinet Meeting: Discussing National Defense Plan. Britain and France to Take Cooperative Steps

[Reuters, Paris, April 11] Today's French cabinet meeting will conduct an in-depth study of the situation in the Balkans and the Mediterranean. Although the French Foreign Office declared last night that Britain has no intention of occupying Corfu, it is inevitable that Britain and France will take cooperative steps to ensure security. It is reported that several bills related to national defense will be passed at today's meeting to ensure that the country is ready to deal with emergencies at any time. However, those who are well-informed about this matter are still very cautious. In short, the national defense plan will not be revealed to the outside world until after the Council of Ministers meets on Wednesday. Foreign Minister Bonnet will report to the cabinet today on the consultations with British representatives and representatives from other countries. Prime Minister Daladier will also explain the steps the government is taking to ensure France's security. Political circles said yesterday morning that the atmosphere has eased somewhat, but it is very clear that France will not give anyone an opportunity to take advantage of it.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, April 11] "Le Temps" in Paris published an important article yesterday stating that France is taking all steps to prepare for extraordinary events. Britain and France have established a joint agreement on preparatory steps, but the content is unknown.

[Associated Press, Paris, April 10] Morning newspapers in London and Paris unanimously agree that military strength in the Mediterranean must be increased, but there is no definite information on the steps to be taken. "Le Petit Parisien" reported that Britain has decided to cooperate with the French government to strengthen its bases in the Mediterranean. "Le Petit Journal" stated that no one should be surprised by the naval demonstration near the Greek island of Corfu.

### Greek Prime Minister's Declaration: Advising People to Remain Calm. Rumors Italy Will Guarantee Greek Integrity. Yugoslavian Public Opinion Criticizes Italian Aggression

[Reuters, Athens, April 10] Greek Prime Minister Metaxas issued a message to the Greek people today, stating that the government is very confident in maintaining Greece's absolute independence and integrity. The declaration also advises everyone to focus on their work and trust that the government will continue to defend their safety and honor.

[Reuters, Paris, April 10] According to Italian sources in Athens, Greek newspapers will publish the full text of the Italian government's guarantee of Greece's absolute territorial integrity tomorrow.

[Reuters, Bucharest, April 10] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu's diplomatic activities have been extremely busy since returning to Bucharest from Istanbul. After arriving in the country, Gafencu immediately met with the Yugoslavian ambassador and the French, Italian, and Hungarian ministers.

[Reuters, Yugoslavian Capital, April 11] Although the Yugoslavian government authorities are still maintaining a reserved attitude, domestic public opinion has been fiercely critical of Italy's forceful occupation of Albania. During the Easter holidays, small-scale anti-Italian movements occurred in the Yugoslavian capital and Skopje. The newspapers also pointed out that Italy can now do as it pleases in the Adriatic Sea, and unless it takes the circuitous waterway through the Bosphorus Strait to the Danube River, Thessaloniki will become the only source of maritime supply for Yugoslavia.

[Associated Press, London, April 10] Although Britain and France are actively preparing to protect their interests in the Mediterranean, they seem to have resigned themselves to the fate of Yugoslavia and will not provide immediate assistance. There are three reasons for this attitude: (1) Germany and Italy are currently pressuring Yugoslavia to submit; (2) Italy's invasion of Albania has cut off Britain's route to aid Yugoslavia unless it passes through Romania; (3) Yugoslavia's internal problems cannot unite. However, Britain and France are still consulting with Romania, a friendly country of Yugoslavia. At the same time, the Soviet Union still suspects whether Britain is sincere in expanding the anti-aggression coalition.

### Worldwide Religions Condemn Italy

[Reuters, London, April 10] London Islamic leaders met today and resolved to demand that Mussolini rescind the title of "Protector of Islam" that he took after annexing Abyssinia and urged the suspension of the Oriental Studies Society established in Italy five years ago to protest Fascist propaganda in India, Egypt, and the Orient. The society has sent a delegation to the Italian embassy to present the above demands on behalf.

[Reuters, London, April 10] The "Evening Standard" today published an article attacking Mussolini's invasion of Albania and its impact. Its catchphrase was, "One blow from the Italian dictator has aroused opposition around the world. People, whether Catholic, Protestant, or Muslim, have spoken out in unison to condemn it." The newspaper pointed out that no one believes that Italy's invasion of Albania is an isolated and limited action. It then compared today's British reaction with the situation in September last year, stating that the public's indignation is more widespread and that the previous sense of shock is no longer present.

### Turkish Prime Minister Declares: Taking Measures to Deal with Aggression. National Assembly Unanimously Trusts

[Reuters, Turkish Capital, April 11] Turkish Prime Minister Saydam solemnly declared in the National Assembly today that the government has taken measures to deal with the events that the country may encounter. He said, "Fortunately, the government is well-equipped with military strength to deal with all dangers and aggressions." The National Assembly unanimously agreed to trust the Prime Minister's declaration.

### Italy to Announce Annexation of Albania. Italian King to Go to Tirana for Coronation

[Haitong News Agency, Budapest, April 11] According to the "Rome Gazette," the Italian King has agreed to accept the position of King of Albania as well. The Italian King will hold a grand coronation ceremony in Tirana at the end of this month. Albania will be administered by a governor appointed by the Italian King.

[Haitong News Agency, Milan, April 11] According to reports from Tirana, the Albanian administrative agencies have resumed work, and Fascist party branches have also been established.

### Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to Visit Rome. Discussing Relations with Poland. Will Also Visit Berlin

[Reuters, London, April 11] According to the "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in the Hungarian capital, Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki and Foreign Minister Csáky, along with several officials, will travel to Rome this weekend to hold important negotiations with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano. The impact of the Anglo-Polish Agreement on the traditional friendship between Hungary and Poland and the unresolved relations between Hungary and Romania will be the main topics of discussion at the Rome meeting. After visiting Rome, the Hungarian politicians will travel to Berlin to express the deep friendship between Germany and Hungary.

### Schacht Passes Through Bombay. Destination Unknown

[Reuters, Bombay, April 10] Former President of the German Reichsbank Hjalmar Schacht arrived today aboard the British ship "Malaya" and then left for an unknown destination.

### Italian Reserve Troops of All Levels Rumored to Have Been Called Up

[Reuters, Rome, April 11] It is rumored that Italian reserve troops of all levels have been called up today to replace the Italian troops sent to Albania. It is believed that the majority of the reserve troops belong to the 1912 class. It is reported that the enlistment period will be very short. Unofficial estimates put the total number at about 100,000. The rumor that the British government will leave the Albanian affair to the British Parliament to discuss has aroused hope among political figures here that Britain will let Italy's actions pass by with only a diplomatic note. Currently, Italy is jealously watching every statement about the island of Corfu. Some quarters are displaying threats, stating that if Corfu is occupied to oppose Italy, Italy will send troops to advance towards Thessaloniki.

Brief Commentary

### South China [Guangdong] Army's Increased Disturbances

Since the Battle of Nanchang, the South China [Guangdong] Army has been actively engaged in expanding its disturbances. The fierce battles in the Tingmen-Xinhui area have not eased so far, and the [Guangdong] ships off the coast of southern Guangdong are showing signs of a major advance. Recently, the situation in the North River, the East River, and even the Hong Kong border has become tense again.

The main purpose of the South China [Guangdong] Army's increased disturbances is to consolidate Guangzhou and its surrounding occupied areas, prevent counterattacks by our frontline troops, and suppress guerrillas everywhere, so as to step up the use of our country's human and material resources to quickly launch a new "Southwest General Offensive." At the same time, these disturbances also have some speculative and adventurous elements. They want to take advantage of the tense situation in Europe, transform the major disturbances into a general offensive, advance directly into Guangxi and Yunnan, and retreat to establish a propped up government in South China.

Our army's active military progress in counterattacking Guangzhou is the main way to combat the South China [Guangdong] Army's increased disturbances. However, if we want this counterattack to be truly effective, it depends not only on the improvement of the combat effectiveness of the frontline troops, but also on the general mobilization of the strength of the people in Xiang, Gan, Min, Yue, and Gui, and the general launch of the war in the entire Guangdong war zone and the guerrilla warfare behind the lines [enemy lines]. Here, we must pray for the government's efforts to improve politics and improve people's livelihoods. Here, we must also pray for the enthusiastic donations of overseas Chinese from all over the world and their enthusiastic return to serve the country.

### Far Eastern Anti-Aggression Bloc

Recently, the South China × army has been expanding its disturbances, and in the near future, the scope of these disturbances may expand further, and the situation may become more serious. In particular, Japan forcibly occupied Hainan Island, forcibly occupied the Xisha Islands, and recently forcibly occupied the Nansha Islands, ×××××××××××××××××××××××××. Once the Japanese aggressors obtain some exaggerated "victories" in South China, the outbreak of a major disaster in the Far East will definitely not be a matter of long delay!

This situation is naturally made more serious by the current Italian occupation of Albania and Germany's continued new offensives.

Today's newspaper reported news from Tokyo that the British Governor of the Straits Settlements, Thomas, recently visited the Soviet Union, signed a non-aggression pact with the Siamese government, and also said that Vietnam's attitude towards Shanghai has also become more friendly. Britain and France already have a tendency to actively organize a Far Eastern anti-aggression bloc. Although this news is inevitably a sign of Tokyo's nervousness, it is indeed the only way to save the Far Eastern crisis that the Japanese aggressors fear most. China, which is bravely resisting the war, naturally welcomes this anti-aggression bloc movement and is optimistic about its success. However, the most important thing is to first ensure that China occupies a very important equal position, and secondly, to have the participation of the Soviet Union and the United States. Otherwise, Britain and France's collaborative warnings will neither take effect in Europe, nor will they turn into guns and cannons when moved to the Far East! And to deal with the Japanese aggressors, not only warnings are needed, but only guns and cannons are needed, guns and cannons suitable for use by China, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France, surrounding Japan.

### The Inevitable Defeat of Germany and Italy (Conclusion)

— Translated by Yang Bi

However, the people of Italy and Germany, don't underestimate others too much. In fact, the navy under the union of Britain and France is enough to look down upon the whole world. Whether it is the Far East or the Near East; Central Asia or Asia Minor, the Mediterranean or the Atlantic, even the South African shipping lanes, India and Persia, as well as the territorial waters of Britain and France, are almost completely under the control of their navy.

As long as the British and French navies can maintain a steady supply of food for the British and French people and raw materials for industrial manufacturing, continuously transported from the Americas, self-governing territories, Africa, and India; then, Britain and France are simply impeccable. If there is anything, it is only the problem of aerial threats.

The French may have to withdraw from Savoy, and may even lose Tunisia and Nice, and may not even be able to keep Corsica. Italy and Germany may divide Switzerland, seize Holland, Belgium, Denmark, and North African territories; dominate Spain, and even gallop to the distant Near East and Turkish government, becoming the masters of governance and economy in this new world, but all of this cannot allow Italy and Germany to achieve a quick victory and a quick decision as they wish.

The war will still have to continue, until London and Paris, or Milan and Munich, are left without a single brick or tile, before it can be considered over. As long as the eighty-seven million people of Britain and France and the troops recruited overseas can hold on to the land front of their country and maintain continuous supplies, and the navy can blockade the Axis powers—the western theater of war—the Bosphorus, the Black Sea, and the Soviet territory—no matter how barbaric and cruel the Axis powers fight this war, it will be in vain. The Axis powers will definitely not win.

They cannot win because they cannot obtain a decisive victory at all. It will become a war of attrition. In this way, all the war preparations they have completed at high speed and high cost will inevitably collapse more easily than the preparations of democratic countries, which are step-by-step and lower in cost. Then, just wait and see Hitler and Mussolini shout themselves hoarse!

This is the main reason why Germany and Italy are always afraid of the outbreak of a real war. They themselves understand very well that they can easily gain the upper hand in peaceful negotiations. A series of facts in recent years, up to the Munich Agreement, have shown that they have been rising step by step and taking advantage of every opportunity. But if the threat of war really opens up war, everything will be over, the dream of victory will surely be shattered; what remains is a dead end.

Therefore, I say that if a second European war really breaks out, the Axis powers are bound to be defeated.

Therefore, we can also know that the Axis powers are fundamentally afraid of war. As long as the democratic countries no longer muddle along and take on the burden of striking the attackers, the atrocities of the Axis powers will definitely be restrained.

### Pirates Roam the Sea: Two Cargo Boats Robbed in British Waters; One Boat Companion Tragically Wounded by Random Gunfire; One Boat Companion Missing, Suspected of Being Abducted

Recently, banditry has become increasingly rampant. Two more cases of Siamese bandits robbing boats and shooting crew members have occurred in Hong Kong waters. It has been confirmed that Cargo Boat No. 2219, registered in Hong Kong, with boat owner Lin Guangzhang, 56 years old, was transporting goods such as carrots and onions from Chenghai to Hong Kong on the 9th of this month. There were twelve crew members and eight passengers on board. At 5 pm on the 10th, while passing through the Lam Tong Mei waters, they suddenly saw a boat carrying fifteen bandits coming towards them. They fired more than twenty shots to intimidate them and ordered them to stop. After docking nearby, the bandits swarmed onto the boat, moved the cargo to the bandit boat, and left swaggeringly. The people on the cargo boat saw the bandit boat go far away and continued sailing to Hong Kong to report the case to the police station. It was found that the loss was about 150 yuan. Boat companion Lin Hong was shot and wounded by the bandits in the random gunfire and has been sent to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injury is not fatal and is expected to survive. In addition, boat owner Jiang Wei, 38 years old, of a cargo boat with no license number, went to the Hong Kong Marine Police Station yesterday afternoon to report that at 3:30 pm on the 8th of this month, in the Shen Wan waters between Shen Wan and Longgutan in British territorial waters, while he was carrying cargo and leaving Hong Kong, a boat suddenly came towards him. There were six people on the boat, all carrying long guns and Mauser rifles and other dangerous weapons. They swarmed onto the boat, moved 18 dan of onions and 22 dan of sweet potatoes to the bandit boat, and thoroughly searched the boat before leaving leisurely. At the same time, it was discovered that a boat companion, Yin Xing, 50 years old), a native of Xixiang, Baoan, was suddenly missing and must have been abducted by the bandits. During the past week, the atmosphere in Hong Kong suddenly became cold, and the low temperature was rarely seen since Hong Kong had meteorological records.

### The Case of Air Force Huang Hanwen's Death After Surgery: Proven to Be Caused by an Overdose of Mongolian Medicine; Doctor Left Hong Kong, Postponement Indefinite

Huang Hanwen, 28 years old, a member of our Air Force, was injured in battle a month ago and came to Hong Kong to undergo surgery at the Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital in Happy Valley. He died on March 20. The doctor in charge of the surgery was Pan Xihua, the assistant was Sun Runkun, and the doctor who administered the Mongolian medicine was Dr. Ouyang. After the incident, Magistrate Fuller of the Central Magistracy once opened a court to investigate. At 2:30 pm yesterday, the court continued to examine the corpse. Dr. Pan Xihua took the stand to continue providing evidence, followed by Dr. Crowa Wales, who testified about the examination of the corpse, stating that at 9 am on March 23, he examined the body of the deceased Huang Hanwen. The cause of death was due to excessive Mongolian medicine. Not only was the breath of Mongolian medicine detected in various internal organs, but also the blood vessels. It was impossible to prove how much Mongolian medicine the deceased received. Lawyers Shi Yulin, Qi Xibing both cross-examined the witness briefly. Then, a German detective took the stand and testified that the deceased died on March 20. Between the 20th and the 28th, he went to the Hong Kong office of the Chinese Aviation Commission and Wanchai Road to visit Dr. Ouyang, who administered the Mongolian medicine. According to his family, Dr. Ouyang had left Hong Kong for Macau and had not returned as of yesterday. After the German detective finished testifying, the magistrate declared that the case was postponed indefinitely.

### Fifteen Indian Soldiers on Hunger Strike in Protest Due to Dissatisfaction with Officer's Punishment

According to the Hong Kong newspaper, the Hong Kong Telegraph, last Friday, a conflict occurred between British and Indian soldiers in the 8th Regiment of Heavy Artillery. One of them was injured in the arm by a knife. The officer in charge placed the four Indian soldiers under custody. Subsequently, eleven more Indian soldiers expressed sympathy and voluntarily requested to be detained together. The fifteen Indian soldiers were punished by the responsible authorities and were reportedly detained in the fortress detention center on Mount Davis. They all went on a hunger strike to show their resistance, but soon gave up. It is said that the conflict was due to racial differences.

### A Man Seriously Injured in Wanchai Johnston Road After Being Beaten by Thugs; Skull Fractured, Life in Danger; One Suspect Arrested and Under Investigation

At 11:30 am yesterday, in front of No. 122 Johnston Road, Wanchai, in front of the Lady Duchess of Bedford Child Health Centre, a man, about 30 years old, wearing black shirt and pants, was suddenly beaten by a group of thugs. Punches and kicks were exchanged, and one of them held a short stick and struck the man hard. His skull was fractured on the spot, blood gushed out, and his clothes were soaked. He was a bloodied man who lost consciousness and fell to the ground, unable to rise. The thugs did not let go and continued to beat him severely. The injured man turned and moaned miserably. Nearby residents, seeing the situation, feared that a murder would occur, so they whistled to alert the police. At that time, an Indian police officer and a Chinese detective were passing by and heard the news. They rushed forward to investigate and saw the injured man lying on the ground, blood splattered everywhere. They also saw a group of thugs still swarming and beating him. They immediately arrested one of them, while the others fled in disarray towards Tai Yuen Street and Spring Garden Lane, disappearing without a trace. They failed to catch them. Because the injured man was seriously injured, they reported the case to the police station on the one hand, and immediately called the Wanchai Fire Station to send a Red Cross vehicle to bandage the injured man and take him to Queen Mary Hospital for treatment. At that time, the injured man was completely unconscious. It was impossible to say how he was beaten by the group of people. The police detective took the suspect who was arrested on the spot back to the police station for detention and investigation. The man gave his name as Lau Mau and vehemently denied committing the crime. After the injured man was admitted to the hospital, he remained unconscious after the doctor tried various treatments. Therefore, his name and address were also unclear. Because the occipital bone of his skull was fractured, the situation was very dangerous, and there was a risk to his life.

### Increasing Number of Refugees Coming to Hong Kong from Mainland China; Hong Kong Government Plans to Build More Refugee Camps for Accommodation; Locations are Being Sought, and Several New Camps Will Be Built; Training Refugees for Production Work to Enable Them to Support Themselves

Since the outbreak of the war in South China, tens of thousands of people from various parts of Guangdong Province have fled to Hong Kong. Apart from a small number who are able to support themselves, the majority are displaced and destitute. The Hong Kong government, based on the principles of disaster relief and good neighborliness, is actively seeking ways to accommodate and assist them. The accommodation locations that have been completed include several refugee camps in Kam Tin, Ma Tau Chung, and North Point, accommodating a total of about tens of thousands of refugees. They are provided with food, clothing, housing, and residence. In addition to gradually repatriating them, statistics show that there are still about 10,000 refugees in each camp. However, the war in South China continues to expand. The refugees who have already come to Hong Kong are difficult to repatriate to their original homes, and new refugees continue to arrive in a steady stream. All refugee camps are overcrowded. It is reported that the Hong Kong government is planning to increase the number of refugee camps to fundamentally assist these refugees. Suitable locations are now being sought in order to plan the construction. In the future, when the new camps are completed, new refugees can be sent in for accommodation in a steady stream, so that they will not be displaced. The Hong Kong government's steps for assisting refugees are to first concentrate on accommodation and provide them with living necessities. If the environment permits, it will consider the situation in their hometowns and decide whether to repatriate them. However, many refugees' hometowns have been destroyed by × fires and artillery fire. Their fields and properties have been completely lost, and they cannot make a living even if they return home. Therefore, the authorities will provide them with various work skills and provide them with opportunities to learn crafts so that they can support themselves. The Kam Tin refugee camp has already started to implement work-for-relief measures. The refugees in the camp produce a wide variety of daily necessities, and the results are good. In the future, the authorities will implement industrial training for refugees in other camps so that they can support themselves and not become lazy refugees.

### Hong Kong News in Brief

In order to develop Hong Kong's mineral resources and promote the mining industry, the Hong Kong authorities previously requested the Malayan authorities to loan engineer J.R.H. Kirshaw to Hong Kong to conduct a survey. After a month, Kirshaw has completed the survey and plans to submit a report to the Hong Kong authorities. It is reported that the authorities will draft mining legislation based on Kirshaw's report.

The British Post Guangzhou and the French Post General Xiafei, after colliding outside Hong Kong some time ago, returned to Hong Kong. The Guangzhou entered Kowloon Dock, while the General Xiafei entered Taikoo Dock. It was found that the Guangzhou has been repaired and left the dock yesterday morning, while the Xiahu is scheduled to go to Shanghai on May 5.

Recently, a merchant from Mexico also ordered two new ships in Hong Kong, managed by Chetson & Co. The first ship weighs 3,300 tons, is 300 feet long and 46 feet 6 inches wide.

The Hong Kong Branch of the China Wartime Children's Welfare Association recently held its second fundraising campaign to develop its operations. Today, the association authorities will lead the child refugees to solicit donations from various banks and major stores. It is also scheduled to hold a flower sale on the 22nd of this month to raise funds.

The Hong Kong China Refugee Children's Craft School was organized by Xu Qian, Shen Yibin, He Xiangning, Chen Youren, Huang Meixian, Ruan Weiyang, Wu Hanzhen, etc. At present, all preparations are nearing completion. After its establishment, it will begin to recruit child refugees from the war zone, teach them national knowledge, and cultivate their productive skills.

The Refugee Relief Committee of the Hong Kong Chongzheng General Association, in view of the severe disaster situation in various villages near Zhangmutou, has allocated 1,000 yuan to be distributed by the representatives of the area.

### Comforting Wounded Air Force Soldiers: Another Living Testament to the Inevitable Victory of the Resistance

— Qi Zhuo

Visiting Wounded Air Force Soldiers

How delighted I am! We have the opportunity to comfort the wounded air force soldiers who once took to the skies to vent the frustrations of our 450 million compatriots and to fight for the "national dignity" of the entire Republic of China. Yesterday afternoon, in the gentle warmth of the sun, I, as a reporter, along with a dozen enthusiastic friends from the Amateur Social Club, carrying sincere hearts, went to the ×× Hospital, the recuperation place for our wounded air force soldiers, to express our regards.

As we stepped through the hospital gates, we were eager to be in the presence of our air force heroes, to shake the hands that once struck at the *Japanese*. In front of the room of soldier Huang Changlin, we gently knocked on the door. Mr. Huang Changlin, a man of strong build, with solid muscles, and his wounded left arm swollen like a large ball, walked with a slight limp and greeted us in his pajamas. After we explained our purpose, he happily invited two other wounded air force comrades from the next room to meet us. They were both vigorous and lively young men. One hopped in with a smile, using a wooden crutch, while the right eye of the other was still wrapped in medicated cotton. The youngest of the three was still wearing the cap of the aviation school. Upon seeing us, he raised his hand in salute, and we quickly bowed and shook their hands, expressing our deepest respect. We presented the beautiful fresh flowers, domestic fruits, books, and newspapers we had brought with devotion to these three lovable and admirable air force soldiers after delivering our words of comfort.

After some modest and polite words, they proceeded to tell us about their experiences in the war of resistance and the bright future of our air force, filling us with immense inspiration and joy.

Winning Battles Even When Outnumbered

Mr. Huang Changlin, a native of Guangxi, is the deputy captain of the × squadron of the ×th Air Force Group. He is highly knowledgeable and experienced, having served as an instructor and piloted new Soviet aircraft. He was wounded after striking *Japanese* aircraft in Hengyang. Wei Tang, who was wounded in the right eye, and Xu Linghan, who was wounded in the foot, are both natives of Zhejiang and were classmates and comrades in the same squadron. They are all highly skilled young air force soldiers. After dealing a heavy blow to *Japanese* aircraft, Wei was wounded in Zhijiang, and Xu was wounded in Kunming. It is said that when the number of Chinese and *Japanese* aircraft is equal, we can utterly defeat the *Japanese* aircraft. If the number of Chinese aircraft is half that of the *Japanese* aircraft, we can still win. Even if the number of Chinese aircraft is only one-third of the *Japanese* aircraft, we can still put up a strong fight. The great victory of the air force in Wuhan is a testament to this. The three of them were all wounded in battles where they were outnumbered, but they still managed to win and inflict maximum damage, only being forced to land due to their fearless efforts. For example, in the battle where Wei was wounded, he fought with eight Chinese aircraft against fifteen *Japanese* aircraft and shot down four of them. Wei was hit by bullets all over his body and remained unconscious for thirty-four days before regaining consciousness. He was transported to Chongqing by transport plane and later ordered to fly to Hong Kong for treatment. The experiences of Huang and Xu in getting wounded are also praiseworthy chapters in the history of the bloody resistance against *Japan*.

The Wishes of the Three Air Force Soldiers for Overseas Chinese

The Shortage of Aircraft Is the Main Weakness

When we heard that "after we shot down *Japanese* aircraft, suddenly dozens more *Japanese* aircraft surrounded us. After desperately fighting against them, we had to inform the other aircraft by radio and land because of the damage to the aircraft and injuries to ourselves. Our injuries were originally unnecessary, all because of the shortage of aircraft," we were filled with awe. We further asked how they could still win even when the number of Chinese aircraft was half that of the *Japanese* aircraft. According to the three of them, our new aircraft are indeed very powerful, but the *Japanese* aircraft, which have been prepared for aggression for a long time, should not be underestimated either. Overcoming the *Japanese* and defeating *Japanese* aircraft completely depends on mental strength.

Mental Strength Overcoming Material Strength

Their school motto is: 'Our bodies, aircraft, and bombs are prepared to perish together with the *Japanese* warships and positions!' Every one of our brave air force soldiers is a practitioner of this school motto. They prioritize the nation and the people above all personal concerns. If their mental state is not good, the aviation authorities allow them to take leave without any coercion. They are meant to take to the skies with the determination to defeat ten enemies with one. What especially moved us was: 'When we are in the most dangerous situation, we deliberately steer our aircraft to collide with the *Japanese* aircraft, so that we perish together! However, the *Japanese* pilots have seen through us! Many air force units have had similar experiences. When our aircraft approaches their aircraft and is about to collide, they immediately evade and flee!' — A road is forged where there is no road, and life comes from the determination to die. Here, we have another living testament. In that case, it seems that the spirit of *Japanese* pilots is much inferior to that of our air force. The three of them answered in unison: 'That's for sure! Apart from following orders, they are actually tired of war. Apart from following orders, each of us believes that we must fight to the death for the survival of the nation and the people.' Truly, this is the great and glorious new air force of the new China.

International Sympathy and Assistance

The three of them, especially the talkative Wei, eloquently told us about how the Chinese air force flew to Japan, how the air force achieved such amazing results in shooting down *Japanese* aircraft in Wuhan, a series of technical terms, and the horsepower and combat methods of various aircraft. In response to our inquiries, they also said: 'The pilots and material assistance of the International Volunteer Group are also very inspiring to us. Especially the Soviet pilots, who are often with us. They are very close, and they all believe that China's war of resistance is also fought for the universal principles of justice and righteousness.'

The Glorious Future of the New Chinese Air Force

'As for our new air force, a large number of new aircraft will soon be built up.' Captain Huang also said very responsibly: 'Every one of our air force members is dedicated to the country. The new Chinese air force definitely has a bright future. This is enough to reassure the people of the country.' We were truly inspired to the extreme.

After talking for a full two hours, deeply moved, the ladies who accompanied us sang two songs, 'Comforting the Wounded Soldiers' and 'China Will Not Perish'. Then, with reluctance, we shook hands and said goodbye.

'China will not perish! China will not perish!…' On the way back, we were still singing this.

### *Japanese* Landed at Chiwan and Chan Uk; Failed to Invade Nantou; Fierce Fighting Ensued; One Chinese Policeman Died; Shenzhen Remained Peaceful; Shekou Customs Evacuated to Hong Kong

[Shenzhen Express] More than two hundred *Japanese* soldiers invaded Nantou for the third time yesterday morning. The *Japanese* landed at Chiwan and Chan Uk and raided the county seat. Our guerrillas fiercely resisted in the suburbs of Nantou. Both sides exchanged machine gun fire, and the fighting was quite fierce. Only one policeman on our side was killed and several were seriously injured. Details are as follows:

*Japanese* Troops Invade Nantou Again by Two Routes

Nantou in Baoan County had previously fallen twice. The *Japanese* soldiers usually deployed cavalry and passed through Taiping, Guangji Market, and Shajing, or advanced from Huanggang. Therefore, our side had already received intelligence from along the way before the *Japanese* soldiers arrived. However, this time, they changed their approach and attacked by water. At three o'clock yesterday morning, taking advantage of the darkness, they took more than twenty large and small fishing boats, escorted by *Japanese* warships, and arrived at the sea off Chiwan via the Lingdingyang. Some landed at Chiwan, and some landed at Chan Uk. As dawn broke, they advanced towards Nantou in two routes.

Fierce Fighting Results in *Japanese* Failure

After receiving an urgent report from the outposts, Chi Zhongkuan, Commander of the East River South Bank Command, and Luo Fengxiang, Commander of the Third Guerrilla Column, immediately ordered the Fourth Guerrilla Brigade to ambush in the suburbs of Nantou, preparing to launch a surprise attack. After nine o'clock, fierce fighting broke out between the *Japanese* and us. The *Japanese* fired wildly with machine guns, and we, hiding in concealed places, retaliated with machine guns. Only one policeman on our side died and several were injured. Finally, the *Japanese* were repelled. Chief Commander Chi Zhongkuan and Commander Luo Fengxiang, Commander Wang Ruozhou, and others have now dispatched guerrilla teams from all routes to reinforce the area to prevent the *Japanese* from invading again.

Shenzhen Remains Quiet; *Japanese* Aircraft Reconnaiter

After the news of the *Japanese* invasion of Nantou reached Shenzhen, the people remained calm. A *Japanese* aircraft flew over Shenzhen once at noon for reconnaissance purposes. It did not drop any bombs yesterday. After learning that the *Japanese* had landed in Chiwan and Chan Uk, the Shenzhen police immediately took strict precautions and dispatched additional police officers to patrol. The *Japanese* who landed at Chiwan and Chan Uk were very close to Shekou. At the time of the landing, the *Japanese* threatened to sweep Shekou. Therefore, the customs officials in Shekou immediately evacuated. At around 11:00 AM, the Baoan ferry returned to Hong Kong, and the smuggled goods were also transported back to Hong Kong.

*Japanese* Intention Is to Obstruct Our Teams

According to general opinion, the *Japanese* army's invasion of Nantou was not intended to disturb the New Territories. Their main goal in occupying the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway was to drive out the Chinese guerrillas operating along the Shilong and Zhangmutou lines. According to Chinese military sources, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Chinese troops stationed in Baoan, along with the Guerrilla Study Team, engaged in fierce fighting with the landed *Japanese* troops between Shenzhen and Nantou. The Baoan military authorities are now stepping up their defenses to block the *Japanese* from invading.

Another Message Says Fighting Still Taking Place in Taiping

Another message states that at 3:10 PM yesterday, the Baoan ferry arrived in Hong Kong from Baoan. According to passengers who spoke to reporters, there was no fighting in the Nantou area. However, from a distance, flames could be seen raging in Taiping, and the fire was very intense, presumably caused by the *Japanese* army setting fire to local fishing villages. According to what they knew, at around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, about two to three hundred *Japanese* soldiers, aboard several armed fishing boats, approached the shore of Nantou. The *Japanese* soldiers landed continuously and then boarded more than a dozen cars and drove into Nantou City. This time, the *Japanese* re-invaded, presumably to reinforce the defenses. After the *Japanese* soldiers landed, the *Japanese* armed fishing boats sailed out towards Lingdingyang one after another between 8:00 and 9:00 AM yesterday morning. It is also heard that the Baoan ferry will continue to operate this morning, carrying passengers and goods as usual. Traffic between Hong Kong and Baoan is not currently interrupted.

### Our Guerrilla Forces Achieve Victories in the Nanshun Area; *Japanese* Transportation Is Constantly Attacked by Us; Guangsan Railway Train Bombed, Killing More Than 200 *Japanese*

(Nanhai Express) The *Japanese* army in Ronggui and Daliang, Shunde, has recently been supporting the Xinhe front line. Therefore, *Japanese* transportation is frequently seen in the Nanshun border area, and it is extremely busy. It is found that in recent days, the *Japanese* army has been transporting military supplies by water and land from Foshan to Daliang and Southwest to supply the *Japanese* troops. There have been several attacks on the way by our guerrillas, which are listed below: (1) On the 2nd of this month, the *Japanese* Katano Artillery Regiment sent more than 60 *Japanese* soldiers with six small steam boats, loaded with food and bullets, from Pingzhou to Daliang. At 4:00 PM, when they arrived at the river between Macun and Dadu in Shunde, they were detected by the Longwei unit of our guerrilla detachment. They gathered more than one hundred members of the guerrilla team and ambushed on both banks of Dadu. When the *Japanese* passed by, they suddenly fired machine guns at the *Japanese*. The *Japanese* were caught off guard and suffered heavy losses. In this battle, three *Japanese* steam boats were sunk, and more than ten *Japanese* soldiers were drowned. Sergeant Okamoto Noichi of the *Japanese* Katano Artillery Regiment was also killed. (2) On the 4th of this month, the *Japanese* Ashidachi unit stationed in Lanshi sent three or forty *Japanese* soldiers to transport six large carts of fodder, canned food, and dry rations along the Shunde-Foshan Highway. When they arrived at the intersection of Xiaobu and Shuiteng, they were discovered by our Nanhai guerrilla team. They dispersed and occupied the nearby high ground and dangerous terrain and threw hand grenades at the *Japanese*. Our guerrillas were exceptionally brave and charged forward fearlessly, engaging in close combat with the *Japanese* for about 30 minutes. The *Japanese* were overwhelmed and retreated towards Lanshi. In this battle, our guerrillas destroyed two *Japanese* transport vehicles, captured one vehicle, with about eighty bags of rice. The remaining three vehicles escaped and retreated, and more than twenty mules and horses were killed. Eleven *Japanese* soldiers were killed, and five or six guerrillas also died heroically. (3) At 10:00 PM on the night of the 5th of this month, a *Japanese* military train of six cars was traveling from Foshan Station along the Guangsan Railway to Southwest. When it approached Luocun Station, it detonated a landmine planted by our guerrilla team. There was a loud explosion, and flames shot into the sky. Two *Japanese* military cars were destroyed on the spot, and more than two hundred *Japanese* soldiers were killed. The other cars were also unable to move. The *Japanese* soldiers retreated to Foshan in a panic. Our guerrillas are now very active from Luocun to Nange stations. The Guangsan Railway has been suspended since the 6th.

### *Japanese* Harass Our Coastal Areas; Fujian Prepares for Wartime Measures; We Are Determined to Defend the Great Fujian; Coastal Residents Move Inland to Reclaim Wasteland

(Fuzhou Express) Since occupying Amoy and Kinmen Islands, the *Japanese* have been actively building them into bases for sea and air landings to invade Fujian, in order to control Fujian Province and echo the *Japanese* on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. They also frequently send warships and aircraft to harass the coastal areas, attempting to land. An officer of our unit saw this early and secretly went to Chongqing last month to request instructions from the highest authorities. After detailed discussions at a military meeting, a complete plan to defend Great Fujian has been formulated to crush the *Japanese* plot. In addition to strengthening the existing militia in various places and drafting able-bodied men into the army, several newly established coastal defense heavy artillery teams and mechanized teams have been transferred from a certain department of the Central Government to be on strict alert. Military experts from a certain country were hired to design coastal defense lines along the Fujian coast, assessing the terrain. The work will soon be completed. Therefore, the *Japanese* attempts to send troops to land have been unsuccessful, and their warships have been heavily damaged by our artillery teams. Recently, our authorities have designated the coastal areas as war zones. In order to ensure the safety of the residents of these areas, they should be relocated to safe areas in advance to avoid the tragedy of fleeing in panic. A decree has been issued to limit coastal residents to prepare to move to the counties of Northwest, Jiliu, Chong'an, Ningyang, Taishun, Dehua, Jianyang, Yong'an, Ningwu, Jiangle, Shunchang, and Mingxi as reclamation areas. Reclamation offices will be established, with the county magistrates of those counties serving concurrently as directors, and deputy directors will be appointed by the Provincial Relief Association. Travel expenses and accommodation for each immigrant family will be temporarily provided by the reclamation offices. Each family will be allocated tens of dollars to purchase agricultural tools and build thatched huts for working in designated fields. In addition to a subsidy of 150,000 yuan from the Central Relief Association, the remainder of the funds will be provided by the Fujian Provincial Government. Fuqing County, which was frequently bombed by *Japanese* aircraft in the past, has also suffered from a drought this spring. There has been no rain since the beginning of spring, and many residents have moved to Chongqing in an orderly manner. Other counties will continue to relocate immigrants and prepare for scorched-earth resistance.

### Fourth War Area Promulgates Measures to Reward Capture of *Japanese* Soldiers; 60 Yuan Awarded for Each *Japanese* Soldier Captured; 120 Yuan Awarded for Each *Japanese* Officer Captured

(Shaoguan Express) Zhang Fakui, Commander of the Fourth War Area, in order to encourage the anti-*Japanese* sentiment of the front-line soldiers and civilians and the spirit of charging into battle, has ordered that for the capture of *Japanese* soldiers by combat troops, guerrilla forces, and civilians, in addition to following the "Provisional Regulations on Rewarding the Capture of *Japanese* and Puppet Officers and Soldiers" formulated by the Military Affairs Commission, meritorious service will be recorded or promotions will be given based on the circumstances. He also issued a notice yesterday to the commanders of various defense forces and guerrilla commanders to inform their subordinates that a reward of 60 yuan will be given for each *Japanese* soldier captured and 120 yuan for each *Japanese* officer captured, in order to encourage them. However, if those captured are compatriots from Northeast China or Korea, they must not be killed or humiliated. Even *Japanese* captives should be treated well and persuaded to surrender by methods that will move them, in order to demonstrate the generosity and benevolence of the Chinese nation.

### *Japanese* Strengthen Outer Defense Line and Rush to Build Huangpu Port; Guangdong Guerrillas Determined to Crush *Japanese* Plot

(Shamian Express) Our armies from the East, West, North, and Sichuan are counterattacking the *Japanese* and making great gains, inflicting heavy blows on the *Japanese*. At present, the various armies are continuing to advance toward Guangzhou to wipe out the Guangdong *Japanese*. It is found that the *Japanese* chieftain Ando has been very busy lately but is unable to cope. According to intelligence here, the so-called commander of the South China Expeditionary Army, Ando, in order to protect Guangzhou, has strengthened the outer defense line of Fuzhou, enforced forced labor, and set a deadline of one month to complete the Huangpu military port area, so as to serve as a base for the outer defense line of the sea, land, and air. Recently, in order to prevent attacks by our air force, they have added night shifts. It is estimated that more than 5,000 people in the occupied areas have been forcibly recruited. The *Japanese* army forces them to supervise the work every night. However, our guerrilla forces have repeatedly tried to crush the *Japanese* conspiracy and plan and have launched several sneak attacks. However, the *Japanese* army is heavily guarded in the Huangpu area. Therefore, our guerrilla forces have decided to change their strategy and obstruct the progress of the *Japanese* construction. Therefore, there are occasional small encounters near Huangpu, and the port construction project has also been greatly affected.

### Our Forces Launch a General Offensive on Huaxian Overnight and Recapture It; The "Emperor's Army of Jiangtou" Collapses and Flees in Panic; Driving the *Japanese* South of Xinjie

(Special Telegram from Wengyuan, 11th) A certain regiment of the 12th Army Group launched a fierce attack on Huaxian on the night of the 8th. After a night of fierce fighting, as dawn approached, our reinforcements continued to join the attack. The *Japanese* were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed and fled in panic. Our army recaptured the county seat. In this battle, hundreds of *Japanese* were killed, and countless military supplies were captured. An inventory is currently underway. The corpses of *Japanese* soldiers were found all over the suburbs of the city. Among the *Japanese* corpses, the unit numbers of Watanabe and Fujii were found, which were officially called the "Emperor's Army of Jiangtou". When our troops entered the city in the morning of the 9th, the people returned from the mountains and cheered along the way, helping us transport the spoils of war.

A delayed message states that stubborn *Japanese* troops attempted to advance towards Aotou from Maigan on the 7th and 8th, but were severely attacked by us and suffered heavy casualties. After fleeing in panic, another unit of about 2,000 troops attacked north from Huaxian but were lured into the mountains and valleys and counterattacked in one fell swoop. The *Japanese* were unable to withstand the attack and collapsed, abandoning military supplies, suffering casualties, and fleeing. We captured many guns, documents, and horses.

### Twenty Thousand *Dan* of Jiangxi Rice Transported to Xinpu, Chaoshan-Meixian Rice Panic Resolved; People's Food Supply Can Be Assured; Measures for Refugees Determined

[Xingning Quick News] Regarding the matter of relieving the rice panic in Chaoshan-Meixian and its affiliated areas, since Tan Baoshou, the administrative commissioner of the Sixth District, telegraphed the provincial government, Chairman Li negotiated with the Agricultural Credit Bureau and the Jiangxi provincial authorities to jointly purchase surplus rice from Jiangxi Province and transport it to Chaoshan for regulation. The current rice panic in Chaoshan has been resolved. According to the person in charge of the Sixth District Commissioner's Office, the amount of Jiangxi rice transported to Chaoshan is expected to be at least 200,000 *dan*. Transportation points have been set up in Gan'nan Menling, Xinpu, Meixian, Songkou, Dabu, Chaoshan, and other places. It is understood that the first batch of this white rice has been transported to Xinpu and Meixian by vehicles from the Xijiang Trade Department and will soon begin to stabilize prices. Therefore, the rice market has gradually stabilized, and the people's food supply can be assured. In addition, the Sixth District Commissioner's Office, considering that the counties in this district are close to the war zone, and if a major war breaks out, it is difficult to guarantee that a large number of refugees will not enter the area, has specially formulated measures for the Sixth District counties to provide relief to refugees and ordered them to be followed. The contents of the measures are: (1) Evacuation routes for refugees and safe areas to reach; (2) Inspection, management, and transportation of refugees; (3) Old and young women transported by boats and vehicles, the rest walking; (4) After the refugees arrive at the designated location, they must be organized into agricultural, industrial, commercial, women, children, elderly, and weak teams, in order to find ways to accommodate them or allocate work; (5) The refugees' rations will be provided by the organizing agency at a rate of two *jiao* per person per day for food; (6) Each county must establish refugee granaries; (7) After the refugees arrive, they must be introduced to jobs or provided with loans to start small businesses or cultivate land; (8) Refugee handicraft workshops and refugee cultivation areas must be established; (9) Refugee medical clinics and maternity hospitals for refugee women must be established; (10) Refugee education classes must be established to accommodate out-of-school children or send refugee children to various schools for temporary study. As for the refugee relief funds, the provincial government has successively allocated more than 30,000 yuan to the Sixth District Commissioner's Office. Apart from the several thousand yuan that have been distributed to various counties, there are still about 30,000 yuan remaining in the office.

### Encirclement of Guangzhou Taking Shape; Northern Route Our Troops Repeatedly Seize Key Points; Guangzhou × Military Strength Very Weak; Situation in Taicheng and Guanghai Gradually Tightening

[Macau Special Dispatch] Since our general counter-offensive order was issued, the armies of all routes have actively attacked the outer perimeter of Guangzhou, especially the northern route. It has been the most intense. The northern route is where our main force is located. Since the counter-offensive, we have captured many important strongholds in succession. Now the army is heading straight for Guangzhou, and the × chief is extremely anxious. Most of the × along the Guangzhou-Sanshui Road have been transferred to Jiangmen and Xinhui, resulting in weak Guangzhou military strength. In order to hold Guangzhou and plan for the final stand, they have to transfer a part of the × who invaded Xinhui back. The rest are still trying hard to hold on in various places. Therefore, the battles on the various routes of the West River have been extremely fierce in recent days.

Situation in Taicheng and Guanghai

In the past ten days, × warships have gathered on the waters around Haiyan, Guanghai, and Taicheng, constantly firing artillery at our defense lines. They once landed on Mu, but were repelled by our defense forces and local militia. However, the situation is still severe. County Magistrate Huang Qiguang has intensified internal work to cope with the serious situation and has ordered all government officials not to leave their posts without a valid reason.

Battle Situation in Jiangmen and Xinhui

The × troops in Jiangmen and Xinhui have suffered extremely heavy casualties after our fierce battles in recent days. On the 8th and 9th, the × transferred a large number of puppet troops from Ronggui to launch a counter-offensive, attempting to relieve the danger of the city of Xinhui. However, our army held on with the determination to fight, advancing wave after wave. Currently, they are still in a stalemate near the northeast of Jiangmen and Xinhui.

### Movies and Theater; Shanghai Film People in Sichuan; Clothing is the Object of Imitation by Sichuanese

A large group of movie artists, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan a few years ago, organized under the "Shanghai Film Actors Troupe" and, with their past fame on the screen, embarked on a long march into Sichuan to perform patriotic dramas. At the time, they caused a great sensation in Chongqing, Chengdu, and other places, receiving a grand welcome from the audience. At the same time, in terms of patriotic work, it was also a powerful propaganda with great effect. They stayed in Chengdu the longest, and there are still many people giving long-term performances. At first, when they first arrived there, many young men and women in the local area followed this large group of cutting-edge figures step by step, imitating everything. Especially in terms of clothing, it caused quite a few interesting anecdotes.

Barefoot Leather Shoes Bai Yang, Liu Liying, and other female stars, at that time, because the autumn heat had not yet subsided, many people still showed their seductive jade ankles, wearing barefoot leather shoes without socks. The women of Chongqing started a new fashion for this industry, taking off their socks one after another, claiming to be fashionable, and even going further. Some modern women wearing ordinary shoes also did not wear socks, which quickly formed a temporary fashion.

Pom-pom Hat A kind of woolen hat with a large pom-pom on top, which some male actors originally used as nightcaps in the guest house. One day, someone came off stage after acting and accidentally wore this hat to the theater a few times. Many young viewers thought it was a new style popular in Shanghai. In a few days, people in Chengdu competed to imitate it, and it became popular for a while. The young people on the street, coming and going, all wore such a hat, with various colors of red silk, creating a spectacle. Many hat shops in the city also rushed to make them to meet the market demand, and each hat was sold for as much as two or three yuan, still in short supply, which was really a great extra business.

Ribbon Hairtie Bai Yang once went to a photo studio to take a photo. Because she didn't have new clothes, she suddenly had a clever idea and untied a belt from her woolen coat, using it as a ribbon on her head, with the large pom-poms on both ends diagonally adorned. The look was very unique. Later, the photo studio displayed this photo in the glass cabinet on the street, which immediately attracted the attention of many women. Everyone was busy dressing up in the same style, and it became a very popular new "innovation."

Cheongsam Coat Even more laughable was the fact that Shi Chao, Zhuo Manli, and she did not bring her coat. The weather suddenly turned cold in winter, and she was still wearing a thin cheongsam. Shi Chao had no choice but to let her wear one of his coats temporarily to keep warm. Unexpectedly, when the local girls found out, some thought it was also a very new and fashionable outfit, and they all blindly followed suit, not letting Zhuo Manli be the only one to enjoy the beauty.

Such jokes happened quite a lot in Chengdu and Chongqing, which was extremely funny. From this point of view, the propaganda power of those film artists performing patriotic dramas is also a clear proof.

### New Hollywood Movies

He will have an upper-level performance in this film. Nancy Kelly is a new Hollywood star, 17 years old, and is now a basic actor for 20th Century Fox. She will shine in this year's silver screen.

### Which Movie Star is a Famous Photographer?

Humphrey Bogart, people know that he is a villain on the screen. His vicious and sinister facial expressions can make everyone's emotions suffocated. Everyone admits that he is a talent for villainous performances like Laurie Nolan.

However, who would have thought that he is also a photographer with artistic cultivation behind the scenes? In order to take care of the many audiences who want to appreciate his works, he publicly exhibited his life's achievements in New York. His photographic specialty is to use lenses with angles that are different from the ordinary, and he likes to choose cats of different colors as the object of shooting. Do you know that he already has more than a thousand works of cats alone?

Leslie Howard from England is also a photography fan. He said, "The background for my photos is very simple, just a piano, a fireplace, a rooftop that can be outlined, and a few books placed on the table." If you can't find him on the photography scene, then you only need to go to a few large photo studios, and you will surely see him by the camera.

Clark Gable, who is rough and enthusiastic, is also one who is addicted to photography. Once, he disguised himself as a hunter and used three thousand feet of film to record the entire journey he had traveled during his hunting trip. However, when he came back and washed them, he suddenly found that there was nothing on them. He then remembered that he had forgotten to change the film.

Errol Flynn, in order to take good outdoor scenes, had been to wild places such as Barraco, New Guinea, Australia, and Abyssinia with his wife Lily Damita. He has thousands of photos of the lives of the natives there. His two most valuable photos in his life are a photo of himself and a photo of a king of a certain country, which have won awards.

### Weekend International Football Final; Chinese and Portuguese Squads Both Decided; Strong and Well-Mannered Chinese Team May Win Championship Again

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The international football final is scheduled to be held at the Po Field on the afternoon of the 16th of this month (Sunday) at 4:00 PM. This good show will definitely attract the attention of fans, and this is a charitable act, so it is our inescapable duty to contribute money and effort.

Regarding the course of this competition, Portugal won the right to enter the final after winning one game and eliminating the Irish team. The Chinese team won two games in a row, first defeating the Scottish team and then defeating the English team, thus winning the qualification to compete for the championship. They will compete against the Portuguese team on the 16th.

The Portuguese team initially wanted to give up participating due to a lack of talent. Later, veterans Da Gao You Nu, Xiao Gao Shannu, Remidi, and Biludu agreed to play to support the team, which allowed them to form a team. And as soon as they came out, they defeated the Irish team and won the right to compete for the championship.

Of the six major championships, our Chinese team has already won three. More than half of the remaining ones are also believed to be must-wins for our Chinese team. As it seems, it is possible to take over all the championships. Especially this International English Weekly Cup, which is a must-win, because the gains and losses are related to the dignity of the country.

At present, the Chinese team is full of talent, gathering the elite, how strong, to win glory for the country, and will definitely be of one mind and one heart to complete this great cause.

The East is now touring the south, and the players have not returned, so the players under the South China banner will be the main force. However, even if the East returns, the South China players who are selected will still account for the majority.

The entire lineup was selected yesterday. Of the eleven players, only two with the surname Hou are not South China players. Shao Huitang is also on the list, because this is a charity match, and he has made a decision to play for the sake of charity, so this time we will have to trouble this brother again.

In the past, Guo Yingqi has never participated in any collective selection competition. However, this time he occupies a seat and is appointed as the right midfielder, because he has recently played this position in a decent manner, so he is appreciated by the selection committee and can be named.

The Portuguese squad has also been produced. However, Jin followed the East on a southern tour and could not rush back to respond to this game. Xiao Gao Shannu is also a guest in Xiamen, so this time the Portuguese team's lineup is not as complete as when they first fought the Irish team. Facing a strong Chinese team, this difficult hurdle will not be easy for them to overcome. Let's see if the great championship will again belong to our Chinese team. The squads of the Chinese and Portuguese teams are as follows (Stadium Tyrant):

Great China

Tan Junqian (South China China)

Li Tiansheng (South China South)

Hou Rongsheng (Guanghua Club)

### Talking about Tennis

(1) The Origin of Tennis

All kinds of sports in the world, when they were initiated, gradually evolved from very simple games to a perfect and proper kind of fascination today, occupying a considerable position in the sports world. Such things as football, baseball, and basketball have all developed from this evolutionary method to have what they are today. Tennis, of course, cannot escape such a process.

Examining the origin of tennis, it actually began in England. At the beginning, they simply took a small leather ball and used rackets to hit it, with a net in the middle. There were no specific regulations on rackets, tennis balls, or other court and competition rules. Later, more and more people liked to play tennis, and it gradually improved, resulting in today's perfect result.

(2) Tennis Development Worldwide

Since tennis was founded in England, it has spread all over the world. The first country to flourish was the United States, and the United States has a special way of developing tennis, which is called the American style. Many countries in the world studying tennis also emulate the American method. Australian tennis competitions also have amazing results. Their doubles and singles competitions can overwhelm the British Isles, because although British tennis is the founding country, they have made no progress in the game of tennis. New Zealand's tennis is also progressing rapidly, and it is determined to improve, with great progress every day. Other countries such as Germany, Russia, Sweden, and Norway also have research and effectiveness. In recent years, American tennis games have been continuously researched and improved, and it can be said that they have taken the lead in the tennis world. The International Tennis Championship, the Davis Cup, often falls into the hands of Americans. Unexpectedly, a dark horse emerged, and French tennis used scientific methods to become the world's champion. The Davis Cup in the past few years has been taken from the hands of Americans by the French, and the game of tennis has aroused enthusiastic competition among people around the world.

(3) The Current Situation of Chinese Tennis

Since China has had tennis games, it has been almost decades. However, there is still little promotion in various places, and there are even fewer in the inland areas. It is not paid much attention to by people, not as popular as football, nor as competitive as basketball, which has risen later. In this sluggish Chinese tennis world, a thunderbolt suddenly shocked people, that is, in the Far East Games in 1927, Chinese tennis players Lin Shihua, Qiu Feihai, and others returned from overseas and actually won the most outstanding championship. Isn't that an honor for the Chinese tennis world? Even Japan and the Philippines were conquered by them. Since then, people in the Chinese sports world have shown a lot of interest in tennis. It is not impossible for it to develop in the future.

(4) What is a Tennis Season?

Football and basketball all have their seasons. This season is when it is most appropriate to compete and practice with that ball, so this time is set as the season for a certain ball. The tennis season is in the summer, because tennis games are not as intense as football, basketball, and other ball games. There is less running in tennis competitions, so it is more appropriate to practice in the morning and evening on hot summer days than other ball games.

(5) The Relationship Between Tennis and Sports

Tennis is a beneficial game in the sports world, and of course, it has a very close relationship with sports. This sentence is unnecessary to say, but we don't know what benefits there are for the body after studying tennis. Here, we might as well talk about it. When we compete in tennis, we must have a brave spirit, a calm attitude, and lively movements. It is not just about using strong strength, because tennis games do not require intense movements like other ball games such as football. What it must have is that the hands and feet must be light, the eyes must be sharp, and the body and mind must have coordinated actions. Although some strength is required when serving and hitting the ball, it is not limitless. Because if the strength used is not controlled, then the distance of the ball will not be appropriate. Even in ordinary times, when practicing tennis, the strength should be moderate so that you can move around the court and advance and retreat properly. Therefore, the benefit of tennis in sports is that the movement is appropriate and just right.

(6) The Relationship Between Tennis and Intellectual Development

The relationship between tennis and sports has already been mentioned above. Now let's talk about the relationship with intellectual development. We know that tennis games are not only beneficial to sports, but also have great benefits to intellectual development. For example, hitting other balls, or when the ball is still, or when the ball is moving on the ground, you can calmly hit it. When it comes to hitting a tennis ball, you must be in the middle of running. Therefore, before hitting, you must think about where the ball is coming from, what the situation is, how it is flying in the air, and how it is landing on the ground. Then, what kind of hitting method should I use to deal with it, and what method can I use to resist the opponent so that I can win? These points must be considered and decided upon in an instant to come up with a strategy to deal with it and win the final victory. According to this, the game of tennis uses intellect to drive physical strength to make appropriate movements at any time and place during the movement. Therefore, lively intellect, agility, and judgment are indispensable in tennis games. That is, we can use this kind of intellect to control the situation on the court.

### South China Swimming Pool Officially Open; Swimming Performances

### There is a Revival of the Chinese Football Team; Plans to Participate in the League Again Next Year

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The Zhonghua Club team, which won the first-division football league championship three times in the past, could not send a team to participate last year due to a lack of talent. Therefore, the name of Zhonghua was no longer seen. It is now heard that a certain enthusiastic person has taken on the mission of reviving Zhonghua and plans to find a way to send a team to participate in the league again in the coming football season. However, what is heard is like this, and it remains to be proven by facts in the future.

### Chinese Players Win All Tennis Matches Yesterday After Hard-Fought Battles, Decided Only After Three Sets

Yesterday, three matches were held in the All Hong Kong Open Tennis Singles and Doubles Competition. Each match was a hard-fought battle, with each side having to endure three sets before a winner could be determined. In the end, all the winners were Chinese players, adding a touch of glory.

The singles match between Xu Runpei and Crawford was decided only at sunset. Crawford was the runner-up in the hard court tennis competition two years ago. He is full of energy, steady, and resilient. In the first set, Little Xu fought with all his might, taking advantage of his net play to win 6-3. In the second set, Crawford began to play more aggressively, using his right-handed serve to win back a set, tying the score. In the final set, Little Xu calmly countered, taking a 4-1 lead. Crawford fought tirelessly, his face unchanged, and pulled back a game. Little Xu did not dare to be negligent, using both hard and soft tactics, and finally won 6-4, overcoming the difficult challenge. But by this time, Little Xu was covered in sweat.

The doubles match between Li Rurong and He Jialiu against De Fu and Pierce was held at the stand court, with a large number of spectators. In the first set, De Fu and Pierce used their height and long arms to smash the ball powerfully, winning 7-5. In the first game, He and Li learned the opponent's weaknesses, using softness to overcome hardness, and moving the opponent from left to right to win back a set 6-1. In the final game, De Fu was panting heavily and his shots were weak. Pierce could not support himself alone and lost again 6-2.

The match between Lin Tiande and Huang Jinxi against Da Gao You Nu and Remy Di was very intense. The two Portuguese players were both good at serving and had powerful long shots, so they were able to win the first set 6-1. Lin and Huang realized the opponent's power and struggled hard. Lin was skilled at net play and had a sharp serve, assisting Huang's fierce attack to win back a set. In the third set, the two Portuguese players made mistakes. Lin and Huang assisted in the attack and won 6-3. The results of yesterday are listed below:

Yesterday's Results

### A Sports Column That Truly Serves Sports

— Zhuoyue

On the surface, Hong Kong's public sports seem vibrant, with large crowds of spectators watching games. The revenue from ticket sales for each football match is astonishing, rarely seen in the mainland. This enthusiastic audience at ball games can represent the optimistic state of public sports among Hong Kong compatriots. However, upon closer examination, the knowledge and practice of sports among compatriots are very limited. I believe that improving public sports knowledge and promoting public sports, so that compatriots' sports can truly and universally develop, are closely related to all sports organizations. In fact, sports columns in newspapers bear an even greater responsibility. If sports columns in newspapers can truly work for the development of public sports, encouraging the public with the most sincere attitude and methods, so that Hong Kong compatriots can have a basic understanding and appreciation of sports, and realize the importance and necessity of practicing sports, then the level of public sports knowledge among compatriots will naturally improve, and it will be easier to promote or popularize public sports. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the editors of sports columns in newspapers should change their approach in the future, instead of rigidly sticking to the rules and simply reporting the schedule of which team is playing, the results of the game... what the schedule is for tomorrow, etc. They should use more flexible writing to describe sports events and solicit more contributions from sports comrades on sports literature, so that the content of sports columns is enriched, allowing compatriots to directly obtain general sports theories, knowledge, and various exercise methods in the sports column. If this can be done, Hong Kong compatriots' sports undertakings will definitely develop day by day. Among the current newspapers, I believe that only the sports column of Shen Bao can truly serve sports and achieve the effect of promoting public sports. Although it is making this effort, its individual capacity is inevitably limited. Therefore, I specifically offer my personal opinion to those who are enthusiastic about sports, hoping that in the future, sports columns in newspapers should carry more sports theories and knowledge. On the one hand, public sports can be promoted, and on the other hand, our sports comrades can also have the opportunity to learn from each other.

[Editor's Note] Mr. Zhuo is a very famous sports teacher at a middle school in Hong Kong. His sports articles are theoretically insightful and practical. This newspaper has published them many times, and they have been well received by readers.

Mr. Zhuo's praise for this column is more than we deserve. However, our purpose is, as Mr. Zhuo said, to popularize sports, so the manuscripts we adopt focus on practical effects, so that readers can know and practice.

However, this type of manuscript is difficult to write without extensive experience in sports. In the past, this column has been honored to receive contributions from Mr. Quan, Mr. Wang Xuezheng, Mr. Dou Falu, and Mr. Luo. The opinions expressed are all suitable for the needs of practical sports. We hope that the gentlemen will continue to help us in the future.

### Turning Three Bays

— Zimu

"Damn it, no matter how fierce the Japanese devils are, we can catch up with them with this river. We'll capture their warships and bring them back alive!" Zhuan San Wan said to a group of people in the village.

"You're planning to return to Black Stone Rock, haha, haha." The listeners laughed, and hidden in this laughter was a story:

Once upon a time, in a certain village, there was a team of dragon boat racing experts. Their dragon boats paddled the fastest. As soon as the signal was given, they would already have turned three bays. Later, in a race, they paddled too enthusiastically. Carelessly, the dragon boat, as before, went straight into a cave on the riverbank named Black Stone Rock, and never came out again.

"One beat, turn three bays, dragon returns to Black Stone Rock" is a ballad sung by the villagers, because Da Niu was also a dragon boat racing expert, so he got the nickname "Turn Three Bays". Everyone knew the story of "Turn Three Bays", and everyone knew that "Turn Three Bays" was Da Niu's nickname.

Since the violent entered our country, the enthusiasm for resistance has been boiling in the hearts of all our people. The consciousness of resistance has penetrated deeply into the inner layers of our countryside. People with blood and vigor like Zhuan San Wan are of course burning with anger and want to rise up and raise their arms.

However, the people entered deeper. The demon-like claws easily stretched into South China again. The rumbling artillery fire shook the four suburbs of the village, and the flames in the sky dyed the eyes of the villagers red.

"Turn Three Bays, this year's dragon boat race can't be held, but we will always have this day to enter the Stone Rock!" A young man said to Zhuan San Wan with a long face.

"..." Several blue veins were bursting on Zhuan San Wan's face, his eyes were emitting a light of hatred, and the words he wanted to answer in his mouth were blocked by the anger that swelled in his chest.

The next day, there was no sign of Zhuan San Wan in the village, and no one knew where he had gone.

The artillery fire had not stopped, but it had not gotten any closer either. For four months, the had simply been unable to pass the blockade line of the West River. The villagers farmed and lived as usual under the piercing artillery fire, and gradually forgot about Zhuan San Wan.

One evening, the remaining sunlight was casting on the pond in front of the village. Zhuan San Wan was found sitting alone on the stone railing by the pond, wearing a faded, tattered military uniform. His left hand was wrapped in a piece of white cloth hanging from his neck, and his face was clearly darker and stronger than before. A group of surprised eyes surrounded him, and a lot of doubts asked him.

In the conversation, they learned that Zhuan San Wan had been a soldier for the past few months, and also knew that he had come back this time because he was injured.

"Damn it, I don't understand what ability the Japanese devils have to occupy our Northeast, occupy our Shanghai, occupy our Nanjing, occupy our Guangzhou, occupy our Hankou. Just that West River, which is as shallow and narrow as this, they have no way to pass through. If they come, they will be driven away by us ten out of ten times. Sometimes they can't even run away. But I, Zhuan San Wan, rely on this paddle, but I often rush over and rush back again, and I have never suffered any losses."

"Good Turn Three Bays!"

"Long live Turn Three Bays!"

"Long live the Republic of China! Long live our village!"

"Down with the Japanese devils!"

A large group of villagers were so excited that they shouted. A clever person took out a native cigarette and stuffed it into Zhuan San Wan's mouth, and another quickly lit it for him.

The sun went down, and Zhuan San Wan was embraced by a group of dragon boat paddlers into the ancestral hall. They pooled money and busied themselves buying fish, meat, and wine, and ate and drank in the ancestral hall. The door was closed, and occasionally a burst of wild laughter, a burst of cheers, and a burst of roars came out, and finally nothing could be heard.

The next day, there was no trace of Zhuan San Wan in the village again, and the more than ten guys were also nowhere to be found.

It has been more than two months again. Neither Zhuan San Wan nor any of the group of guys have returned. Have they all entered the Stone Rock? No one knows. But the still cannot break through the blockade line of the West River, and the villagers are still farming and living as usual under the piercing artillery fire.

### Hong Kong Journey

— Ma Yin Yin

Painful heart

Shattered a once living journey

Lonely

I stole away from the embrace of my motherland

This is Hong Kong

Sea wind

Sea waves

Sea mist

Daze the island

Island, like a mythical monster

Night covers mystery and profoundness

On the other side, there are also

Battleships, merchant ships, dilapidated small boats

The roar of the sea under the orange color

Is a peach blossom spring in a chaotic generation

A kind of ancient poet's secluded interest

I stopped

This prosperous night market

Sweep away the dust that once stained the edge of my clothes

Two weeks of continuous overcast

Today, still wandering the streets

### Learning and Practice

— You Hong

A friend from the mainland sent a letter. One of the paragraphs said: "...I really want to go to Hong Kong and live the same life as you. If the plan is well thought out, I will do so; because, in Hong Kong, I can possibly learn everything I like to learn. Although, it is a bit sad to say wandering life, but I need to change the air so much, and it is good to learn a little more while I am young. This is not just my wish, but also my plan. If I can't make it this year, it won't be too late next year. I must be able to realize it, and then a wish will be fulfilled..."

In the past, there was a fashionable saying: "Learn from Mr. Lu Xun!" What should we learn from Mr. Lu Xun? Learn his unyielding and indomitable fighting spirit, and his academic achievements; in other words, we must adopt his perseverance and courageous struggle against the , and use all the weapons and secrets against the enemy. And we should also use our weapons as much as possible here to attack the enemies of our nation and the traitors who betray our motherland; because, in this era of great struggle, everyone is difficult to avoid struggle, especially in today's increasingly urgent national crisis, the spirit of struggle is even more needed, which is the inevitable condition that should be paid attention to in "learning".

In Hong Kong today, there are many unemployed and out-of-school youths, and we all need to learn, especially in today's situation where the has turned to a stalemate, the war zone is expanding, and the number of refugees is increasing. Here, generally ambitious youths can find learning opportunities, and should work harder!

Although, generally youths have a considerable understanding in theory, but they are at a loss for practical problems and cannot solve them. Therefore, I feel that our "learning" should be a combination of "theory" and "practice".

I am a youth, and I am also learning, learning in this special environment. I dare not guarantee that I will never be in danger of being contaminated by toxins (?). However, I want to find a piece of fresh air from the dark night shrouded in dust and coal smoke. I want to cultivate this night of slavery to welcome the dawn. In this way, I only have this one answer for my friend who wrote from the mainland. What else can I say besides this?

Finally, I quote Mr. Lu Xun: "In the struggle against the old forces and the old society, we must be resolute, persistent, and constantly, and pay attention to strength..." This is to be taken as a word of encouragement for the youths in Hong Kong in their learning.

The times need us, we must learn modestly, learn practically, and run with the wheels of the great era!

### Husband Jiang

— Luo Feng

"No," I argued, trying to reason, "Aren't millions of soldiers on the front lines right now demanding repayment from the Japanese ××?"

"You still don't understand what I mean. I'm talking about my family. Look, both of my old folks are nearing seventy, and while their hearts are willing, their bodies are weak. My elder brother is an opium addict, and that bastard is planning to take a concubine again. Even if you dragged him to the front lines, he'd be scared witless by the first shot. Can my wife go to the front lines? The kid just learned to call me 'dad.' That bastard, besides me, who else is there?"

About a week later. As we were eating lunch, a noisy commotion erupted from the depths of the courtyard. This sound consisted of an old voice, a thin voice, and a clangorous sound. I listened carefully; the clangorous one was undoubtedly Jiang the Younger, the old one I presumed to be Jiang the Younger's father, and the thin voice? Must be Husband Jiang's wife.

Mrs. Bai, seeing me staring blankly, bowl in hand, mocked me, saying:

"Why don't you go take a look? You seem very concerned about the people's livelihood."

"You don't know the full story..." I put down my bowl and replied seriously, then truly walked towards the door.

"What full story?...This is just being idle because you're well-fed," she said, watching me walk out of the room. "Just take a look and come back. Don't interfere in other people's family matters..."

Finally, there was a sharp, short laugh, containing an element of mockery that seeped into my consciousness, transforming into a thin layer of disgust.

A housewife is most skilled at slander. And if the seeds of resentment are sown in the heart of a housewife, they will grow into an evergreen tree that never withers, because the narrow world of the family is not suitable for people with open minds to survive.

Reaching the outer layer of houses in the courtyard, I saw Jiang the Younger. My guess was correct. This was clearly a major dispute brewing over "methods." Jiang the Younger was jumping around wildly, his arms and legs flailing. The old man was stomping his dark walking stick, using coughs as a substitute for words he couldn't fully express. The woman, like a half-crazed person, was shouting and cursing irrationally:

"Are you still going to be so heartless?...Beware of ×××× bombs!...

"Curse all you want," Jiang the Younger bent his waist and waved his hand, indicating non-resistance. Then, he straightened up and directed a worker resembling a plasterer on the roof.

"Tear down the tiles!" He issued the order decisively. "Tear them down, you bastard!"

However, the old man tried his best to stop it.

"You bastard, that won't do!"

"It will." Jiang the Younger pointed at the worker on the roof and shouted, "You bastard, tear them down for me."

"See if you dare to tear them down!" The woman stretched out her claw-like hands and pounced on Jiang the Younger like a ferocious tiger, gnashing her teeth and muttering, "Are you bullying me, a woman? Are you blind? I'm not afraid of anyone, I've seen Japanese devils!"

"I'm not afraid of ×××× either!" Jiang the Younger rolled up the sleeves of his khaki Zhongshan suit and puffed out his chest, preparing to fight.

At this moment, if I hesitated even slightly, war would inevitably break out. The old man was truly willing but unable, turning around and shouting into the inner courtyard for help. Therefore, I couldn't stand by and watch.

When I appeared between them, both Jiang the Younger and the woman were stunned and withdrew their hands, but Husband Jiang was the first to grab my sleeve, saying:

"Look, this woman is worse than the Japanese devils—" Before I could speak, the woman grabbed my other sleeve, saying:

"Am I cruel? Please judge who is the wolf." She wasn't from Sichuan, but the way she spoke was like popping beans, making it impossible to tell what dialect she spoke. These two rooms originally had a rent of fifty yuan for half a year, which expired yesterday, but I had already asked him to renew the lease. But he didn't raise the rent earlier or later, and yesterday he suddenly raised it to one hundred and twenty yuan. I begged him to raise it less, since I am a refugee. But he said, 'Too much, or move out quickly.' But you think, housing is so tight these days, where am I going to find a place in one day? This morning he came to chase me, I said the house is hard to find, I am afraid I will not find one in a day or two, and he said, if I do not find it, I am sorry, I am going to demolish the house, isn't that right?" She pointed at the worker on the roof. "He really came to tear it down. Please judge, who is the cruel one?"

"Listen to me," Jiang the Younger said, seizing the opportunity to interject, "That chicken, everything is expensive, everyone's life is affected, isn't it extra for me to raise her rent a little?"

"You raised it by five hundred yuan. Your house, you have the right to, but why didn't you wait until I found a house and deliberately tear down the house to drive me out? You wolf!"

"How am I doing it deliberately? Didn't you say that followed, ever since we built this house, two people have died one after another. This house is suppressing the White Demon God, so it must be torn down and rebuilt. Today is the day to break ground..."

"Speaking against your conscience, you're fooling me, old woman!..."

"Shh! You bastard, it's decided to tear it down! Tear down the tiles!"

The old man laboriously raised the antique walking stick, threatening Jiang the Younger, and while coughing, he cursed:

"Husband Jiang,...you've turned this family into a chicken coop,...you...bastard, get...out! Get out!...I regret having you..."

Jiang the Younger, unhurriedly dodged the old man's cane, swaying his wide hips from side to side, and walked angrily towards the outer courtyard, muttering in a low voice:

"Who doesn't regret it, I'm just not happy to manage this messy household!"

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

Aren't they the same flesh and blood as human beings? It seemed to say that the murderer who killed her would not be him, but her own father—the traitor of the motherland. If you record this hatred, do not misremember the name of the hater. It seemed to say, wishing happiness after death to those unfortunate in life, blessing her soul to find a permanent place in the sacred sky, accompanying the sun and moon, and resting in peace forever. She immediately knocked his hand away, thinking it was being instigated to seek lewdness and sin. She looked at him—no longer the incompetent one after putting away the pistol, nor the vicious thug who threatened her with the pistol, but another person—like an ignorant and expressionless statue, and at this time, complemented by the night, she felt even more isolated and terrified on the snowy road. So she retreated in fear, trying to get away from him, but her wrist was held, as if locked by an iron chain. As a result, she could only step on the snow continuously with her feet, trying to break free. They struggled for a long time, but the hand that was held still did not belong to her.

The snow fell even heavier. Before it fell, the snow seemed to be layers of snowflakes, each as wide as the sky, but it was broken by the storm in the middle of its descent, shattered into giant leaves, and after landing, it restored its original integrity. This disc-like body could be seen clearly, increasing layer by layer, seemingly not allowing a single drop of alien color to be leaked in the universe, seemingly secretly arranging the funeral altar for all mankind. Everything seen was silent dead, and the desolate wind was the weeping of mourners from beyond the sky. In this tragic atmosphere, he began to say to her:

"I can't let you go, and you refuse to come with me; then, I can only... beat you to death here, please forgive me!"

She seemed to be startled by this sincere tone; so she did not dare to stubbornly say:

"Beat me to death then,"

"Ah? Beat to death..." She immediately asked again: "If you beat me to death, do you still need money?"

"Don't worry about it, I'm just going to beat you to death!"

"Then why can't you let me go?"

"Why?...Why?...It's to solve this job!" (34)
