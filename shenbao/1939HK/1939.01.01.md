### U.S. Sends Note to Japan Rejecting Plan to Dominate the Far East; Ready to Express Economic Retaliation

[United Press International, Washington, 31st Dispatch] It is learned that the United States has drafted a note and will have it delivered to the Japanese Foreign Ministry today by U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Grew, rejecting Japan's "New Order" plan for the Far East, reiterating the U.S. emphasis on respecting treaties, and preparing to participate in international conferences to properly resolve Far Eastern issues.

[Haitong News Agency, Washington, 31st Dispatch] The American Chamber of Commerce in Tianjin has expressed growing concern due to the announcement by the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce yesterday of discriminatory treatment toward some American goods, and has listed recent cases of hostile treatment of individual goods. Political circles here generally consider this matter very serious. If the Japanese do not change their attitude, the U.S. may express itself in economic terms. It is reported that the U.S. government has decided to protest to Japan, demanding that American goods be treated distinctly from Chinese goods. Furthermore, the full text of the note will be published after U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo, Grew, announces that it has been properly delivered to the Japanese government.

### Arita and Yonai Publicly Declare the Necessity of Encompassing the Western Pacific

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 1st Dispatch] Japanese Prime Minister Konoe held talks with several important ministers yesterday. It is reported that the discussion focused on the principles held by Konoe in China, as stated in his recent declaration. According to well-informed sources, the final policy regarding Japan will be submitted to a cabinet meeting on January 6th for a decision.

[United Press International, Tokyo, 30th Dispatch] Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and Naval Minister Yonai stated in their New Year's messages that Japan intends to eliminate the Western powers' view of the Far East as their colony, and therefore Japan must seize leadership of the Western Pacific. Arita stated that Japan intends to eliminate the old concept of Western capitalism turning the East into a colony. He also attacked the great powers, praising Germany's attitude towards Japan, and said, "Other countries do not recognize the actual situation in eastern Asia, and there are even some countries that make unreasonable demands without regard for the actual situation, so it is necessary to correct this misunderstanding." Yonai said, "The assistance of third countries to General Chiang Kai-shek is an unfriendly attitude towards Japan and a plan to interfere with Japan's actions in China. The revival of China is only possible under the protection of the military, so Japan must obtain the leadership of the Western Pacific."

### Government Forces in Western Country Launch Full Counteroffensive; Madrid Under Heavy Night Air Raid; Naval Battle at Gibraltar

[Reuters, Barcelona, 31st Dispatch] Government forces launched a counteroffensive in the southern part of Lerida Province at 10:30 this morning, and are now advancing along the Segre River towards Saragossa. Saragossa is a major communication route less than three miles from the government forces' front line. If government forces can capture that location, they will control the rebel forces' rear transportation line for attacks toward Brunks. According to the government forces, the Italian army divisions in this area are in serious danger of having their lines of communication cut off. Transportation in this war zone is favorable to the government forces because the government forces' wing units can be protected by fortifications along the Segre River. The rebel forces are vulnerable to counterattacks by government forces from the Atala region, and the government forces are in a stronger position in other sections as well.

[Reuters, Madrid, 31st Dispatch] From 8:00 last night to 1:05 this morning, there was continuous bombing, killing five people and injuring thirty. The southeastern area of Vasquez suffered the most damage. [Reuters, Saragossa, 30th Dispatch] This location acknowledges that government forces launched a fierce counteroffensive on the southern front yesterday. Furthermore, Franco's headquarters stated that rebel forces advanced from Granada earlier today, occupying the town of Bobla, and built a fortress on the bridgehead across the Canal River. Rebel forces at the fortress south of the bridge at Pla de Ize broke through the government forces' defense line and continued to push toward the Camara Han region. They also stated that the rebel forces had cut off the highway from Beinavente to Sivo Sigel.

[Reuters, Gibraltar, 30th Dispatch] Official sources here have issued a declaration regarding the conflict in Gibraltar harbor between Spanish and rebel forces, stating that four sailors on the government forces' destroyer "Chrodes" were killed and seven were injured, one of whom later died in the hospital. Reuters has learned that the deceased will be buried at sea, with the "Chrodes" monitor participating in the funeral. The casualties on the rebel side are currently unknown.

[Reuters, London, 30th Dispatch] The Spanish rebel forces today issued a declaration regarding the battle in Gibraltar harbor, stating that only one rebel mine-laying ship and the gunboat "Volcano" participated in the conflict, but did not mention any casualties. Later, more detailed reports from the Gibraltar side stated, "No rebel ships were sunk."

### Hitler Issues New Year's Message to the German People; Hopes to Contribute to International Peace in the Coming Year

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 31st Dispatch] Hitler issued a New Year's message to the German people, listing three major accomplishments to be urgently realized: (1) to cultivate the spirit of national unity under the National Socialist Party among all the people; (2) to establish and strengthen the nation's military power; (3) to continue completing the Four-Year Plan to solve the labor shortage, with particular emphasis on the economic integration of newly acquired territories. He then discussed Germany's relations with other countries, stating briefly, "Regarding foreign policy, Germany's position has been thoroughly explained. Our friendship with Fascist Italy is particularly clear to the public and should be inviolable. Mussolini's great achievements in maintaining peace over the past year have a significant place in historical fact, and we can only express our deep gratitude for this. We should also express our gratitude to other politicians who jointly seek paths to peace and solutions. Our foreign policy attitude can be summed up in one sentence: the Anti-Comintern Pact. Beyond that, our only hope is to be able to contribute to international peace in the coming year. May God bless us to achieve this goal."

### Germany Demands Equal Submarine Tonnage from England; England Asks Germany to Explain Reasons; Negotiations Currently Underway in Berlin

[Reuters, London, 30th Dispatch] It has been learned that Germany has sent a note to the British government stating its intention to build submarines in accordance with the "Anglo-German Naval Agreement," with a total tonnage equal to that of British submarines. The two sides are currently negotiating in Berlin based on the provisions of the "Anglo-German Naval Agreement." According to the "Anglo-German Naval Agreement," the total tonnage of the German navy must be limited to 35% of the total tonnage of the British navy, and the total tonnage of submarines must be limited to 45% of the total tonnage of British submarines. Germany may increase its total submarine tonnage to match Britain's if it deems it necessary, but before doing so, it must first conduct friendly consultations with the British government. It is reported that among the British representatives sent to Berlin for negotiations on this matter, there are plans to ask Germany what specific changes in circumstances necessitate the request to increase submarine tonnage. The British delegation has already raised several points, requesting Germany to explain them, hoping that through these consultations, Britain can reach a consensus with Germany. The total tonnage of British submarines is currently about 70,000 tons, while Germany's is about 25,000 tons. If Germany increases its submarine tonnage, Britain will inevitably have to re-examine the tonnage of other types of submarines, as the total tonnage of the German fleet should still be 35% of the British fleet. Furthermore, the scope of the Berlin talks will also include the armament of Germany's two new cruisers.

[United Press International, London, 31st Dispatch] According to reports from Guilin, Germany's intention to increase its submarine and cruiser fleet is to counter the Soviet Union's construction program, but this news has caused alarm in Britain, as the terrible impression of German submarines attacking British ships during the Great War in Europe has not yet faded.

### U.S.-German Relations on the Brink of Rupture; U.S. State Department Officials Refuse to Criticize German Government's Order for Newspapers to Attack the U.S.

[United Press International, Berlin, 31st Dispatch] U.S.-German relations are on the verge of rupture, as German sources say that there is no basis for the hope of improving U.S.-German relations. Hitler's official newspaper also stated that the U.S. is insistent on provoking conflict with the German people, and Germany is eager to seek peace with the U.S., but it will never trust most Americans or allow the government to implement its current reckless policies.

[Reuters, Washington, 30th Dispatch] The "People's Observer" here continues to attack the U.S., stating that Germany could easily import 3-4 million bales of U.S. fabric each year, but this depends on the U.S.'s "commercial policies and obstinacy." The newspaper also mentioned President Roosevelt's appeal for peace to Hitler in September, when Roosevelt said that the peaceful resolution of hundreds of millions of people is mankind's noblest historical contribution. The newspaper said that President Roosevelt no longer remembers his previous words, so he lets Hull, Ickes, Pittman, and others spout nonsense.

[Reuters, Berlin, 30th Dispatch] Today, German newspapers, with official authorization, published a statement saying that if U.S.-German relations are influenced by forces seeking Jewish interests, there is no hope for improvement. This is the first time that German newspapers have published Germany's protest against U.S. Interior Secretary Ickes' speech and the U.S. State Department's refusal to apologize. Since the publication of this statement, German authorities seem to have ordered newspapers to attack the U.S. The People's Observer editorial stated, "The U.S. State Department's implicit approval of Ickes' malicious insults shows what the future holds for U.S.-German relations under the current authorities in Washington. The failure of the U.S. at the Pan-American Conference may be the reason for its anti-German sentiment, and its attacks are an attempt to shift internal blame. The Washington authorities clearly want to create tension in U.S.-German relations in order to justify the need for a large-scale military expansion to the American people." Outside reports say that relations between the two countries may be severed after the newspaper attacks, but well-informed sources deny this possibility, saying that various anti-American movements have been suppressed over the past week to avoid disturbing the Christmas holiday between the two countries.

### Second Round of British-Italian Talks; Italian Newspapers Say Important Discussions Will Take Place; Chamberlain and Others to Depart on the 12th

[Reuters, Rome, 30th Dispatch] British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will travel to Nice on January 12th to lay a wreath at the Italian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier before holding their first talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. That evening, Prince Colonna, the Governor of Rome, will receive the distinguished British guests, followed by a banquet hosted by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. The British delegation will hold a second round of talks with the Italian Prime Minister on the 13th. Italian newspapers predict that further talks between Britain and Italy will be necessary because there are important issues that need to be discussed.

### The New Situation on the Pacific After One and a Half Years of War

— Wang Jiyuan

China's war of resistance against Japan is not only a war for the entire Chinese nation to seek its own independence and freedom of development, but also a war to maintain the balance of land-based interests in the Pacific. In other words, the war of resistance is, on the one hand, for the ultimate survival of China itself, and on the other hand, it fulfills the task of a watchdog for the European and American powers that have vested interests in eastern China. This is a common understanding among international political commentators worldwide who love peace and have fair minds.

After one and a half years of war, the facts have proven the correctness of this observation. At present, the vast markets and existing vast interests of Western powers in the Far East mainland have been subjected to the control of Japanese warlords and the seizure and destruction by Japanese militarists for no reason. However, if we analyze with sharper and broader vision, we can say that the organizational power of the new powers in the Far East is constantly developing and strengthening, while all the forces of Japan in the Pacific and on the Far Eastern mainland are constantly moving towards a process of decline and weakening. The executioner of the East - Japan - this is the new situation and new order created on the Pacific today.

Two

The basic characteristic of this new situation is the continuous increase in China's war resistance forces, while Japan's losses are extremely heavy.

According to the report of our supreme leader, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, our strength has increased thirtyfold in the past year and a half. Our military organization, based on maintaining 250 national defense divisions, is largely in place, and includes many new mechanized units. Furthermore, we have established a stable foundation for long-term war in terms of economic construction, political facilities, cultural work, diplomatic operations, and the application of strategy. Not only can there be "light at the end of the tunnel" in terms of finance and the supply of national and military necessities, but the compromising forces within China's political arena are also gradually establishing themselves overseas, the front line is becoming more solid, and the force of resistance against Japan is becoming more concentrated.

Conversely, when we observe the interior of Japan, we can fully expose a state of being overwhelmed and struggling to advance or retreat. The mobilization of troops has reached two-thirds of its total troop resources (approximately 1.5 million), the number of casualties has reached around 600,000, and the loss of aircraft is approximately one-quarter of its total number of aircraft (approximately 600 aircraft). The naval losses are relatively small, but the combined number of large and small warships is also over 50 vessels. In terms of finance, there is an even more severe shortage of funds. More than half of the national income has been plundered by the Japanese militarists to support the war effort against China. The currency reserve rate has been reduced to 25%, and prices have increased by an average of 30% to 65%. Existing military supplies have also been almost exhausted, and they have to buy scrap metal everywhere with letters of credit to rush to produce new goods for resupply. The experienced elder statesmen of Japan can only remain silent when they see the development of this situation. The thoughts and movements of war-weariness and anti-war sentiment are spreading deep into the people. No matter how clever the Japanese militarists' tricks are, no matter how much the Japanese militarists use the emperor's decree to force parliament to pass all wartime laws, its internal collapse is clearly exposed!

### Summary of the First Phase of the War of Resistance and Prospects for the Second Phase (II)

— Pan Lang

(Continued from yesterday's seventh page)

Secondly, the mass movement for adding troops and the political work in the army have been universally applied to the Fifth Route Army and other central units under the good influence of the Eighth Route Army. There is now a political department under the Military Commission, and political departments have been established in various army divisions and regiments. The establishment of the Mass Mobilization Committee and the Mass Training Department has especially contributed a lot to the war of resistance. Thirdly, the armed mass movement began to be implemented in the Soviet area, the Jin-Cha-Ji area, and Guangxi. The anti-Japanese guerrilla war has also begun to develop in various occupied areas across the country. In particular, the establishment of the Jin-Ji-Lu Border Anti-Japanese People's Government in the Jin-Cha-Ji anti-Japanese base area in North China, and the cooperation between the Military Commission's Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army and the New Fourth Army in the Jiangnan area to delete the Soviet-Zhe-Wan Border Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Base, etc., and the people's anti-Japanese regime and guerrilla forces in these places have successively established closer ties with the central government. Secondly, in

Political Aspects

First, our highest authorities and patriotic masses across the country have shattered the plots of peace settlement and foreign mediation stirred up by Japanese traitors after the fall of Nanjing, the fall of Xuzhou, and even the defense of Yuehan, and have strengthened their determination to unite and resist Japan to the end. The Japanese have suffered a great blow to their plan to quickly conquer China by provoking separation, dividing China, and destroying the war of resistance. Second, the anti-Japanese national united front has been further consolidated and expanded! The main reason is the formal close cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the two largest political parties in the country. Following this, the Third Party, the National Youth Party, and the National Socialist Party, among others, joined hands under the banner of the "Anti-Japanese Political Party Union." The leaders of the National Salvation Association, who made the first practical efforts to mobilize domestic unity and resist foreign aggression, continue to work in government agencies, mass movements, or opinion circles. They have never left the masses - Third, the political institutions have begun to be transformed to meet the needs of the war of resistance - on the eve of New Year's Day in 1938, the central government carried out partial reorganization and personnel adjustments. On the one hand, it streamlined redundant institutions, such as the merger of the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications, the merger of the Economic and Construction Commissions into the Ministry, and the abolition of empty agencies such as the Ministry of the Navy. On the other hand, it established the Ministry of Mass Training. Communist leaders Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Zhou Enlai, Peng Dehuai, etc., joined the Military Commission as members. Subsequently, seventy-five seats were added to the National Defense Council to accommodate representatives from various parties, Mongolia and Tibet, and overseas Chinese. In addition, the newly established Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Political Affairs, and Ministry of Social Affairs after the war of resistance have also had their work widely praised at home and abroad. The local political institutions in various provinces and cities have also been improved in dozens of places such as Hubei and Hunan. Fourth, the Kuomintang's prestige among the masses has been greatly enhanced, especially the provisional national congress in April 1938, which decided to establish a presidential system, elected Mr. Chiang Kai-shek as the party's president, and resolved to establish the Youth League to unify the national youth movement. The Kuomintang has begun to move towards a healthy path. In particular, the formulation of the program for resisting aggression and building the nation was taken as the Kuomintang government's policy during the war of resistance, and was protected by the masses across the country. Fifth, the prestige of various anti-Japanese parties, especially the Communist Party, among the masses is also growing stronger. The Communist Party is not afraid of danger in all occupied areas, and cooperates closely with Kuomintang comrades to fight and establish anti-Japanese regimes, destroy, pseudo-rule and its development work, and has made outstanding achievements. Sixth, the establishment and convening of the National Senate, which is the prototype of a civil opinion organ, are important. In particular, the first congress, which opened on July 6 and ended on the 16th, represented 450 million compatriots and reaffirmed the national policy of "resisting aggression to the end and striving for the final victory of the nation and the nation," and announced the principle of "the anti-Japanese national united front of cooperation between all parties, factions, and sectors," and "working together under the leadership of the Supreme Commander Chiang Kai-shek to strive for the final victory and achieve the success of nation-building." In terms of society and economy, such as relief to refugees, relief to the unemployed and out-of-school, financial stability, fiscal consolidation, westward movement of manpower and material resources in the southeast, and development of economic and transportation construction in the west, all have been quite successful after sixteen months of war of resistance. The most important is

(International relations)

We have also made considerable efforts. First of all, due to the consolidation of China's anti-Japanese national united front, due to the firm determination of the Chinese government and the highest authorities to resist aggression for a long time, and due to the heroic resistance of the Chinese military and civilians against division, mediation, and compromise, international sympathy and assistance to us have greatly increased. Not to mention the sympathy and material, military, and personnel assistance from the entire Soviet Union, the people of Britain, the United States, and France have been constantly working hard on economic assistance, refugee relief, and boycotting Japanese goods. The League of Nations General Assembly has also accepted our country's proposal and unanimously resolved to invoke Article 16 of the Covenant and ask all countries to voluntarily assist China in sanctioning the Japanese aggressors. However, our achievements and progress in the first sixteen months of the war of resistance are still not enough to adapt to the need to strive for greater demands in the war of resistance to the end, and have made extremely serious mistakes and still left many

Shortcomings

Particularly important militarily are (1) insufficient combat strength and all equipment at the front; (To be continued)

### Counteroffensives on All Fronts; Guangzhou Shaken; Under Smoke Screen of Peace, Japan Actively Deploys; As New Year Begins, Military Experts Discuss the War Situation

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 31st, 3 PM Dispatch] Since the beginning of the second phase of the war, loyal and brave soldiers on all fronts have been able to launch bloody counteroffensives and fiercely strike the Japanese. According to a certain military expert here, due to the approach of our army in northern Guangdong to the suburbs of Huaxuecheng and the annihilation of more than two regiments by our army in the lower reaches of the Xijiang River, Guangzhou is in a precarious situation. Moreover, the Japanese in Yueyang, northern Hunan, have also been thwarted by our army and are gradually attempting to reconnoiter. Looking at the overall southwestern war situation, it can be confidently asserted that the Japanese forces are exhausted and are on the verge of a quagmire. As a result, the current war situation seems relatively calm, but this is not a standstill. The Japanese army's attempts to invade western Hunan, advance from northern Guangdong, and move south from Yueyang are still being actively plotted and deployed. Furthermore, whenever Japan is carrying out an invasion plot or reorganizing its troops, it always uses malicious diplomatic propaganda and makes false claims about peace. This is truly a deceptive, absurd, and shameless act towards the world. In short, our army has become stronger and stronger in recent battles, and all kinds of Japanese attempts will eventually become dreams.

### Tensions on Shaanxi Border; Japan Attempts to Cross the Yellow River in Western Shanxi but Fails

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 30th Dispatch] After the recovery of Dongyumen, most of the Japanese forces collapsed at Zhangjiatan, Shijiatan. A half-strength unit attempted to cross the river as a test, but was also repelled. On the 30th, near the Niangniang Temple, 20 li east and west of Shijiatan, approximately one Japanese regiment was discovered moving north and invading the vicinity of Bo'ai Lumicun. The Japanese plainclothes team that had infiltrated has been cleared by our troops. There are no Japanese troops within 35 li of the village. There is no apparent movement of the Japanese in Daning. The Japanese in Sanxi Po Sanhou Township, Ningjian, have been attacked and contained by our troops for days, and have been unable to continue their advance.

[Central News Agency, Liulin, 31st Dispatch] (1) The Japanese in western Shanxi have recently launched three routes of attack. One route is from Lishi to Zhangjiazhuang, southeast of Mengmen. Another route is along the highway to Xiazixu, 15 li east of Liulin. The other unit is to Jialing, 20 li south of Liulin. Each route has approximately 700 infantry and cavalry engaged in fierce fighting. (2) Approximately 1,000 Japanese troops, more than ten mountain guns, eight war vehicles, and fourteen heavy trucks have been continuously increasing in Baotou. There are definite signs of an active westward movement.

[Central News Agency, Berkeley, 30th Dispatch] Newspapers here have reported that a large number of Japanese troops have been continuously transferred from North China to Manchuria. Since the past week, Japanese troops transported to Guanwai via Tianjin have reached 50 teams, along with a large number of military supplies.

[Hong Kong News] Councillors in Hong Kong, Zhang Yiqu, Hu Jingzhong, and Tao Xingzhi, yesterday telegraphed the highest authorities of the tram house, requesting the punishment of Wang Zhaoming. The telegram reads, "Respectful salutations to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang in Chongqing. Wang Zhaoming is advocating shameful peace talks, shaking military morale, and endangering the Republic of China. Please dismiss him from all positions and order him to return to the country to appease the people and stop the slander. Councillors Zhang Yiqu, Hu Jingzhong, Tao Xingzhi. (31st)" In addition, Central Committee member Hu Wenlan telegraphed the Chongqing Anti-Japanese Association and various newspapers, saying, "(Omitted ten characters). Reading the newspaper, Wang Jingwei is actually advocating peace, violating the central government's plans, and destroying the overall national effort. Please sternly denounce him. Hu Xilan."

[Our Special Dispatch] According to fairly reliable sources, because Mr. Wang Jingwei was not welcomed by the Anshang government, he came to Hong Kong for a temporary stay and is currently residing near the Hau Wong Temple in Kowloon City at the home of someone named Chen ×× (not Chen Gongbo). Iano, a member of the Japanese Black Dragon Society, came to Hong Kong to engage in activities under the orders of the young officers.

### Complete Text of Chairman Chiang's Address (Continued from the Seventh Edition on the 30th)

They want to tie our hands and feet, strangle our blood, and want China to betray its faith and righteousness, and help them achieve their delusion of dominating East Asia and even controlling the world. May I ask: Our China has been founded for five thousand years, and has always taken faith and righteousness as the foundation of the country. How can we be threatened by them and abandon our position? The spirit of our founding is not to insult the widowed and lonely, nor to assist the violent and strong, and especially not to betray alliances or destroy mutual resistance. I remember that in the early years of the Republic of China, Tanaka Giichi met with our Premier in Shanghai. At that time, the European War was taking place. Tanaka said, "We in East Asia should get rid of all established relations with foreign countries and create a new system." The Premier asked him, "Wouldn't this destroy international treaties?" Tanaka said, "Isn't it very beneficial to China to destroy international treaties and break unequal relations?" The Premier resolutely rejected him, saying, "The abolition of unequal treaties must also be done in a dignified and legitimate manner. If we illegally destroy treaties, even if it is beneficial to our country, we will not do it."

Fellow comrades, this is the spirit of China, this is the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. We resist the war according to this spirit, we resist all unjust power and violence with this spirit, and we must also use this spirit to restore order in East Asia and contribute to the permanent peace of the world.

In short, this war is one in which Japan's spirit and morality have completely collapsed and fallen into violence. We have resolutely taken on the responsibility of world justice in a righteous war. The current warlords of Japan have lost their minds, indulged in their animal nature, and are running wild, able to break through all norms and destroy all human civilization and welfare. Originally, all countries in the world that have treaty responsibilities should open up the darkness and restore the light, and they should have the responsibility to sanction violence and maintain international treaties; but everyone is hesitating and hesitating. China only has to spare no sacrifice to shoulder the great responsibility of this righteous and world-shaking moment, which concerns the survival of public reason. This war of resistance is to achieve the purpose of the national revolution in our country. We seek China's independence, freedom, and equality; in the international arena, we want to uphold justice, restore treaty dignity, and rebuild a peaceful order. Our anti-Japanese war is a war between good and evil, between right and wrong - a war between public reason and power - a war between legality and conspiracy - a war between justice and violence. As our ancient saying goes: "Virtue is never solitary, it is sure to have neighbors." The power of public reason in the world will eventually rise, and all good people will eventually cooperate for justice. As long as we are determined, identify the target, and make a firm determination, the more sincere the hardship, the stronger, the more persistent, the more courageous; the whole country is of one heart, continues to work hard, and final victory will surely belong to us. I hope that our comrades and the soldiers and civilians of the whole country will work even harder to achieve success.

### Transportation Facilities Since the War of Resistance

— Minister of Transportation Zhang Jia'ao

(2) Highways

Highway transportation is even more urgently needed after the fall of the railways. As the war developed, the Ministry increased the repair and construction of major trunk lines. The total length of highways built before the war, from the 20th year of the Republic of China to the 26th year, was 110,000 kilometers. After the war, from August of the 26th year to March of the 27th year, the most urgent highways built with special appropriations from the central government included more than ten lines in Hebei, Shanxi, and northern Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui, such as Haizhou, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Tangyin, Taiyuan, and Datong, totaling more than 1,500 kilometers. Other highways built directly by military authorities through provincial authorities are not included. For example, Jiangsu Province had already completed the main lines before the outbreak of the war, but after the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, many branch roads in the war zone and along the Yangtze River and in southern Anhui were also temporarily built. In addition, the newly added routes in the northwest totaled more than 600 kilometers, and there were also 3,200 kilometers completed under the supervision of the Ministry with partial funding that could be opened to traffic. As for the roadside repair shops, stations, radio stations, telephones, and other equipment along the various roads, they have also been added one after another, and a factory for manufacturing automobile parts is being planned to facilitate transportation.

In the future, the most important highway facilities will be the southwest and northwest highway systems. The important highways in the southwest provinces have now been taken over by the Southwest Highway Transportation Administration of the Ministry and opened to traffic one after another. In the northwest, the Northwest Highway Transportation Administration will take over the original highway engineering and transportation management matters in the northwest provinces and unify the authority. The bureau also has detailed plans and strict regulations for driver training, fuel saving, and vehicle repair, and is making practical improvements to enrich highway transportation in the southwest and northwest provinces.

The most important highway transportation for connecting international routes is the Yunnan-Burma Highway. From Kunming to Huidian in Burma, it is 964 kilometers long. Construction started at the end of the 26th year, employing 100,000 people and taking ten months to complete. It has started to be open to traffic. Furthermore, the Ministry can use manual and animal power for cargo transportation in the rear, promote export trade and increase foreign exchange funds, and has established a transshipment management office to handle this guide transportation. The first transshipment management office is now being set up on the Kunming-Xuzhou route, starting from this route. It is estimated that the daily transportation volume on this route can gradually increase to 100 tons. Depending on the results of the implementation, it will then be promoted to other routes such as the Sichuan-Guizhou and Guizhou-Guangxi routes to handle transshipment on each route to meet the needs of the times and replenish national power.

(3) Maritime Administration

Waterway transportation is extremely difficult due to the lack of ships. When the war broke out, the Ministry implemented blocking operations in Jiangyin, Huangpu, Zhangjiangkou, Zhenhai, Haizhou, the Pearl River Estuary, and the Madang area. The number of ships that were abandoned and sunk was very large, and the means of shipping became even more insufficient. A total of 99 ships were sunk, totaling approximately 140,000 tons, including 14 ships belonging to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, totaling 20,519 tons.

Regarding wartime waterway transportation, in order to coordinate and concentrate the use of resources, the Ministry jointly established the Yangtze River Shipping Joint Office with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and various private shipping companies to handle military requisitioning and the allocation of passengers and goods for all shipments on the Yangtze River and the sea. On the one hand, it ordered the establishment of inland river shipping joint offices by the shipping bureaus in various ports to control the inland river small ships within their respective jurisdictions. Since the implementation, it has been very effective. The most notable are the Yangtze River shipping line, the Guangdong-Hankou intermodal transport line, and the Hunan Province shipping line. These are described separately below:

(1) Yangtze River Shipping Line The Yangtze River shipping can be divided into two phases: (A) First Phase From January to mid-May, the ships in each section were concentrated. 1. Concentrated 14 Yuyi Hong ships (Hankou to Yichang dry season ships) on the Hankou-Yichang section; 2. Concentrated 11 Yuyu dry season ships on the Yichang-Wanxian section; 3. Concentrated 8 Xieyu ships on the Wanxian-Chongqing section; 4. Concentrated more than 200 wooden boats on the Yichang-Chongqing section. During this period, approximately 50,000 or more people were evacuated, more than 20,000 tons of military supplies and equipment were transported, and a total of 40,000 tons of government goods, private factory relocation equipment, and liquid fuel were transported.

(B) Second Phase From mid-May to the present, the ships in each section were concentrated. (1) Concentrated more than 16 Jianghai ships on the Hankou-Yichang section; (2) Concentrated 17 Sichuan River ships on the Yichang section, gradually concentrating a portion of the ships on the Yichang-Hankou section, and recently concentrating a portion of the small ships between Yichang and Fengjie and Yichang and Badong; (3) Concentrated more than 700 wooden boats on the Yichang-Chongqing and Yichang-Wanxian sections. During this period, approximately 100,000 or more people were evacuated, 90,000 tons of military supplies and equipment were transported, and more than 70,000 tons of government goods and private factory relocation equipment were transported.

(2) Guangdong-Hankou Intermodal Transport Line This line is divided into three sections: waterway transport between Hankou, Changsha, and Hengyang, railway transport between Changsha, Hengyang, and Qujiang, and waterway transport between Qujiang and Guangzhou. (1) Concentrated four Jiang ships between Hankou and Changsha; (2) Concentrated Beijiang tugboats between Guangzhou and Qujiang; (3) Concentrated shallow-draft ships and barges between Changsha and Hengyang. The transport results on this line include the evacuation of more than 50,000 people, the export of more than 5,000 tons of intermodal cargo, and the intermodal transport of more than 6,000 tons of domestic sales cargo.

(3) Hunan Province Shipping Line Divided into two lines: Hankou-Changde and Changsha-Changde. Concentrated more than 30 small Jiang ships and tugboats from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and more than 100 barges. The transportation results on this line, excluding the number of people, totaled more than 50,000 tons of military and relocated equipment.

### Denouncing Wang Jingwei

—

After reading Wang Jingwei's attention-grabbing telegram, I feel that this is actually a good phenomenon for the nation. This is because it proves two things. First, the stance of the Chief Pacifist faction is now clear. However, they harbored ulterior motives, long ago holding opinions and planning moves that were completely contrary to those of the entire party and the leadership of the government. They simply became a "microphone" for "friendly nations." The previous evasive statements, such as "My opinion is the opinion of all my comrades in the government, and Mr. Chiang's opinion," can now be seen as complete lies, containing not a single "honest word," but merely his own opinion. Now it's fully exposed. Second, no matter how capable he may be, since the eighteen months of resistance, he lurked in the core of China's resistance, engaging in various activities, tirelessly "deliberating deeply" on his "fundamental policy of Sino-Japanese friendship." Fortunately, the government did not waver in the slightest, forcing him to have no means to use his schemes, and ultimately leaving quietly. Witnessing the government's firm determination to resist, the unity of the entire nation's military and civilians, and the great achievements and progress in various aspects of the resistance over the years, from now on the battle lines are clear. The surrender advocates of the pro-Germany and Italy line of national subjugation have lost their basis. China's future of resistance will shine with boundless brilliance. The entire nation should be even more aware of this, the boundaries between friends and foes are clear, the belief in resistance is strengthened, and we will surely persevere through all difficulties and fight to the final victory. This is what Xiang Ning rejoices over and wishes to bless the nation's future.

However, for the sake of the friendship forged over thirty years of shared hardships, and to be faithful to the words we all said at the deathbed of the late Premier, I sincerely hope that this telegram was a result of him being confused by the north wind during his flight, or because a tapeworm had crawled into his heart, and not the honest words after clear-headedness and repeated "deliberation." Because it's too unlike what a Chinese person would say. The Premier's will was recorded in person by Ms. Song Qingling, and even after more than ten years, the words still resonate in our ears. Now, Wang Jingwei is pandering to foreign powers, seemingly unaware of how this affronts the late Premier, the martyred heroes, the tens of thousands of soldiers resisting, and the compatriots who have already been brutally murdered? If my sincere assumption that he is speaking deliriously due to illness is true, then Wang Jingwei should immediately issue a new statement, retracting all the nonsensical and outrageous remarks he previously made. He should return to Sichuan and reflect on his mistakes behind closed doors to apologize to the people and seek forgiveness from his ancestors. Otherwise, as Mr. Wang himself once said: Being a running dog of imperialism cannot be concealed by the three words "anti-Communist"...

In reality, Wang's telegram, in all its proposed points, uses vague wording, all stemming from how to execute the "proposals made by the Japanese government," echoing the Konoe Statement. It not only lacks any sense of national spirit but has also lost the conscience of a human being. There is no need to refute it point by point. But, to take a step back, let's examine its outline and its key points:

(1) Acknowledging the right of the Japanese to "freely" (meaning without any administrative or legal restrictions) "reside" (acquire land) and "operate businesses" (exploit our country's resources) in all parts of inland China. In other words, preparing to allow this "neighboring friendly nation" to infiltrate all Chinese territory like mercury seeping into the ground. In this case, Japan no longer needs concessions or consulates, as all of China has become a colonial region?

(2) Joint anti-communism, meaning handing over all the administrative police power in China to Japan. It must be understood that Germany and Italy are both ×× nations, each with guns and cannons, so "joint anti-communism" cannot interfere with each other's internal affairs. But China has long been a semi-colony, so how can you brazenly sue for peace and expect "non-interference in internal affairs"? To hand over China's internal affairs and administration entirely to others is not something that can be justified by such words! I completely agree with Mr. Chiang's words that "anti-communism" is actually weakening China. There is really no other explanation. Joint anti-communism is actually inviting others to weaken China.

(3) The so-called economic cooperation is simply "out of the question." Even the Anglo-American "Open Door Policy" has been shattered, so how can you, these semi-colonial slaves, "cooperate"?

(4) Regarding the troop deployment issue, I ask, what solution do you have, other than using long-term resistance to drive the × people out of the country? What does it mean to "allow the stationing of troops in specific locations during the anti-communist agreement, and at most limit it to areas near Inner Mongolia"? You signed the Shanghai Truce, the Tanggu Truce, and still think it's not enough, and want to unconditionally give the five northern provinces to others and smoothly incorporate them into the "Manchukuo" territory? How can you limit it to "at most"? What if people "limit" you when they make the limit? Is it that whatever the "proposals made by the Japanese government," you must implement them, while the opinions proposed by the Chinese people are not even worth a smile to you? Alas, six years ago, I heard people say that you were making sweeping remarks in Nanjing, saying, "Upon careful consideration, Qin Hui cannot be considered a traitor." I never thought that today you would truly follow in the footsteps of that infamous case –

However, what chills me the most is not these absurd statements. Any descendants of Yan and Huang who have a conscience and blood cannot bear to hear such things. I believe that the most dangerous thing is that this article reveals a very dangerous conspiracy, and people should pay close attention to it. What is it? First, the article deliberately presents itself as being from someone within the government, and deliberately avoids using anti-central government phrases. In reality, the spirit is to undermine the central government in every way, trying to make some unclear compatriots think with doubt that "I don't know how these construction governments will handle it." This form of "construction" is more poisonous than an ordinary "rebellion proclamation." Second, it is quite skilled at sowing discord between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and using this tactic to deal with certain elements in the two parties whose feelings are not very harmonious, trying to provoke a great disaster over the already unproblematic local administrative and military issues, so that the "neighboring friendly nation" can open a path to profit. Third, it is still desperately distorting the Three Principles of the People, deliberately smearing the Three Principles of the People, to shake the public's belief in the Three Principles of the People, in order to let the "benevolent rule of the friendly nation" take over people's hearts. Haven't you heard that in military strategy, "attacking the mind is the best"? Therefore, I sincerely urge friends and comrades from all circles and parties not to be misled by these fallacies. We must strengthen our trust in the government, strengthen our mutual unity, and further establish our belief in a Three Principles of the People China. What they want to do, we will not do; what they do not want us to do, we must intensify and strive to do.

Today, the battle lines are very clear. However, there are a few words that I want to offer to some old friends who remain in Hong Kong and Macao, especially those old comrades who are about my age. I have heard that Wang and his "neighboring friendly nation" are sending ××××××××××××× everywhere in Hong Kong and Macao to plot their scheme to sell their personality. I can vaguely imagine their skills in selling snake oil. Isn't it the same old trick? But for the sake of advising the world, I especially offer the following suggestions to share with my comrades!

First, at this critical juncture of national crisis, all past prejudices should be discarded one by one, and especially personal grievances with Comrade Chiang Kai-shek should be put aside. No matter what Comrade Chiang was like in the past, he is resisting the war today, and he is standing on the front line. For this point alone, we should fully support him. Don't take the wrong step, and especially don't fall for their old trick of "anti-Chiang grand alliance" and become a traitor.

Second, everyone should jointly sign a petition to immediately expel him from our party, lest he go to Nanjing to represent some party and talk to the × people. Everyone should no longer invite him to be the "President of the National Government." At the same time, they must be honest, save national currency, and maintain their integrity. ×××× understand the way of red money very well.

I advise my compatriots not to lose heart. The battle lines are even clearer, which is a good phenomenon. From now on, everyone should no longer have any doubts, but should unite as one and move towards the road to victory!

New Year's Message from This Newspaper

As the years change and everything is renewed, what words shall this newspaper offer to our readers as a New Year's greeting today? As we look back at our ancestral land and gaze upon our homeland, we see flames of war raging across the sky, barbarian cavalry overrunning the land, soldiers fighting fiercely in the snow and ice, and compatriots crying out on the brink of death. Yet, the ambitions of the × people have not been satiated, and the conspiracies of traitors are rampant. The nation is in greater danger than a pile of eggs. We truly have nothing to praise. However, if we can look into the distance with a broad vision, then we should see that the × people and traitors face heavy difficulties, their path is coming to an end, and they are facing imminent doom. On the other hand, as we look at our country, we see that our soldiers are fighting bravely on the front lines, growing more courageous and stronger as they fight. The people are cooperating in the rear, without doubt or hesitation, and without yielding or slackening. Internally, the dregs are being eliminated almost completely, unity is becoming stronger, and politics is leaping forward. Externally, all countries are united in sympathy, assistance is becoming more active, international standing is rising, the situation of resistance is gradually turning towards initiative and advantage, and the future of national construction has already revealed a glimmer of light. We live in this great era, and we are approaching great victory, so how can we have nothing to say?

Our nation's heroic resistance against the fascist aggression of Japan has lasted for eighteen months so far. The gains and lessons of the past eighteen months of resistance, as well as the current situation of resistance and the trends in resistance in the future, have been detailed in the article "Summary of the First Phase of Resistance and Prospects for the Second Phase of Resistance." We hope that readers will carefully review it. Today, what we wish to sincerely communicate to our readers and the officials in charge can be summarized into the following points:

The founding of the Republic of China has been going on for twenty-eight years. If these twenty-eight years were likened to a person, then they would be leaving childhood and adolescence and entering the era of youth, vigor, and accomplishment. However, our country has accumulated more than twenty years of internal strife and foreign aggression, leading to weakness and decline to the extreme. In the last seven or eight years, it has suffered fierce aggression from its powerful neighbor, fascist Japan, which has ultimately launched a nationwide effort to implement its plan of armed conquest of China. Therefore, the encounters and situation that our country faces today cannot be compared to the normal development sought by a young person. In order to seek independent survival, freedom, and happiness, our country had no choice but to rise up in resistance against a powerful × that was determined to destroy us. All the pain and difficulties that come should have been anticipated long ago and should not be a surprise. We had no choice but to rise up in resistance. All the pain and difficulties that come should have been anticipated long ago and should not be a surprise, and should not affect our strong will to resist. Yet, in the eighteen months of resistance, our internal affairs have already completed a unity unseen in twenty-eight years, and we have also restored our position in the international arena, which had been declining for nearly a century. And in our × country, fascist aggressor Japan, its military offensive has been stonewalled in China, its political crisis has deepened domestically, and its diplomacy is increasingly isolated internationally. Therefore, as we ask ourselves today, we should also know that we are not ashamed of the pioneers who created the Republic of China with difficulty and that we should raise our national self-esteem and self-confidence, persist in resistance to the end, overcome all pessimism and despair, and oppose any compromise or surrender conspiracy. It is with the blood of countless millions of soldiers and people that we have the glimmer of victory and light today, and we will never allow anyone to erase or betray it halfway, nor can we allow it. This is the first point.

The times are always moving forward, and history does not go backward. Our resistance today is not only to drive out the fascist forces of aggression in Japan and liberate our Chinese nation from death and chains, but also to take on the 5,000 years of civilized history of the Chinese nation and create a new China of independence, freedom, and happiness. In order to complete the prerequisite for resisting and building the nation, we must earnestly promote greater progress in military, political, cultural, and educational aspects. On the negative side, we must intensify our opposition to all defeatism, conservative thought, and feudal remnants that prevent our progress. We should relentlessly eliminate all double-dealers and corrupt forces. Any attempts at division and split, and any puppet government of traitors, are incompatible with our Three Principles of the People of resisting and building the nation, and must be thoroughly eradicated and eliminated. On the positive side, closer unity among all anti-Japanese parties and the people, and the absorption of those who have prestige among the masses and who are determined and experienced in resisting and building the nation are the main conditions for winning the resistance and building the nation in the future so that we can be free and independent in the new world. We should immediately urge them to achieve it. This is the second point.

Following the above two major principles, we would also like to briefly present specific opinions here to celebrate the progress of this twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China and to celebrate the new plans of this twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China. First, in terms of politics, as the name implies, today is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, and the key to the Republic of China lies in the realization of democratic republicanism. Last year, the National Government clearly ordered all provinces and cities to establish senates on this New Year's Day, intending to promote democratic politics, and its benefits to the resistance are immeasurable. At present, most provinces have not been established on schedule due to special circumstances, except for the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, etc. We sincerely hope that the government and the people will work together in the future to promote its complete realization. At the same time, close cooperation among all parties and circles is the foundation for guaranteeing the resistance and building the nation and it is urgent to properly discuss practical methods to prevent provocation and discord and establish solid organizations. In addition, improving political institutions, carrying out the movement to eliminate traitors, and uniting all ethnic groups in the country are all ways to strengthen the connection between the government and the people and the cooperation between military force and people's power. We deeply hope for further achievements. Second, in terms of military affairs, Generalissimo Chiang, President Sun, and Generals Chen Cheng, Bai Chongxi, Mao Zedong, and Zhu De have recently clarified how future resistance must be persistent, long-term, comprehensive, and proactive. However, how to promote this new strategy to the realm of victory depends on the concerted efforts of the front and rear and the occupied areas. If we increase the combat power of the main force, create new troops, transform the political work, equipment, and training of the troops, if we improve military technology, increase the construction of large-scale military industrial industries, if we extensively launch guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines in the war zones, and establish and consolidate anti-Japanese base areas, they are all preparations for the strategic counter-offensive in the future and are our urgent tasks today. Furthermore, in terms of economy, we have been able to steadily maintain an advantage over × for a year and a half, which is a true reflection of the government's efforts, but there are indeed regrets. How to earnestly implement wartime financial and economic policies in the future, increase income and save expenses, how to intensify wartime production and construction undertakings such as agriculture, industry, transportation, and cooperation in the western provinces, all await detailed planning and implementation. In order to stimulate the people's enthusiasm for resistance, the implementation of necessary improvements in people's livelihood should not be ignored, such as the relief of refugees and unemployed and out-of-school youth. There should be a comprehensive and active plan. Finally, regarding seeking foreign aid, in the current favorable international situation, we should do our best to promote it. We hope that in the future, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries will provide more active actions in assisting China and restraining Japan, and we must pay attention to military supplies, raw materials, medicine, technical talents, and financial assistance. The formation of an anti-aggression front between China, Japan, Taiwan, and Korean peoples should also have considerable achievements.

The Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee is scheduled to open on the 15th of this month. As the resistance and nation-building enter a new stage, we dare to offer the above points as a humble contribution. We believe that our readers will also have deep sympathy. Furthermore, this newspaper has been republished in the South for nearly a year. Since the change of format on the 5th of last December, it has been loved by all sectors, and the number of copies sold has increased sharply. However, the colleagues of this newspaper are increasingly aware of their shallowness, and there are still many areas that have not met expectations. In the future, we will work harder so as not to lose the purpose of this newspaper's more than sixty years of serving the people and the sincere hard work of the late general manager Shi Liangcai and his son Yonggeng, and to be a loyal member of the Chinese cultural community. At the beginning of this year, in addition to congratulating the New Year, we also ask for double the care and frequent guidance so as to correct our shortcomings. Then, wouldn't it be the good fortune of not only the colleagues of this newspaper!

Overseas Chinese and foreign friends in this port, including the press, schools, banks, stones, and shops, will be closed for two days today and tomorrow to show their celebration. In addition to holding group worship ceremonies, all overseas Chinese groups are working hard to manage the programs in everything due to the difficulties of the nation. Therefore, there are no grand celebrations. The situation is recorded as follows: The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce decided at the plenary meeting of all directors in December that the New Year's National Worship Conference will be held at 12:00 noon today on the fourth floor of the Chamber.

In addition, overseas Chinese in Hong Kong launched a one-yuan debt repayment movement, and all overseas Chinese groups responded enthusiastically. Li Xingzhi, chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, proposed it for discussion at the fund-raising meeting. As a result, it was decided that the Chamber of Commerce would expand the promotion of this movement. The association requested all subordinate trade unions and townsmen's associations to act in unison. At the board meeting on the 29th, the detailed rules for handling this movement were decided. Yesterday afternoon, another special meeting was held at 2:30 to discuss the progress. As a result of the discussion, the one-yuan debt repayment movement was still handed over to the fund-raising committee of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce for handling. As for the various detailed rules that have been passed, it was decided to implement them starting today and ending on January 31, lasting for one month.

### Wellington Street Fire Yesterday Morning: Three-Story Building Reduced to Rubble; Fire Carried by Wind, Nearly Affecting Neighbors; Losses of Ten Thousand Dollars; Fortunately, No Fatalities

At 3:10 AM yesterday morning, a sudden fire broke out at No. 76 Wellington Street, Central, owned by Zhou Yu. The entire three-story building was engulfed in flames. With the north wind being fierce, the fire spread with the wind, turning the sky red. The buildings opposite and to the left on Pottinger Street, also owned by Zhou Yu, were also threatened by the flames. The terrifying scene was enough to make one lose color. The fire department dispatched as many as six engines to the scene to extinguish the fire, totaling eight hoses directed at the fire. Fortunately, there were no fatalities. The following is a summary of the situation based on investigations:

Investigation of Residents at the Fire Scene

No. 76 Wellington Street is an old-style, three-story building. The ground floor is occupied by Wai Wah Tailors, owned by Zhou Rui-nan, with eight partners. Zhou's family of five resided in the mezzanine at the rear of the shop. The shopfront to the left was rented to the Zhen Guang Jewelry, Gem, and Silverware Store, owned by Chen Bian, with three partners. The second floor was occupied by Dr. Lam Chak-yi, an obstetrician and gynecologist, and other tenants, totaling five households with nineteen people, including adults and children. The third floor was occupied by Hua Ping Girls' School, Principal Liang. To the right, at No. 74, the ground floor was occupied by Man Sun Chinese and Western Printing. The second and third floors were residential. Adjacent to the corner of Pottinger Street was a fruit stall owned by Hop Kee.

Sound Sleep Interrupted by Alarm

At 3:10 AM yesterday morning, the occupants of Wai Wah Tailors on the ground floor of No. 76 were sound asleep. They were unaware when the fire started. It was only when the flames blazed high that they were awakened. By then, the fire was raging and spreading everywhere. Everyone could only rush out the door to escape and sound the alarm. Residents on the second and third floors, as well as those in neighboring buildings, were also awakened from their dreams and hurriedly helped the elderly and carried the young, gathering their valuables and fleeing to the street.

Fierce Fire Affects Neighbors

Before long, all parts of the building were on fire. At a time when the wind was high and the weather was dry, and the building was an old-style structure with wooden stairs and floors, the fire spread rapidly once ignited. In about 20 minutes, the entire building was engulfed. Flames also spread to buildings on the west side of Pottinger Street, and the Hop Kee fruit stall at the street corner was also destroyed. The Biao Ji Food Store opposite had a cotton quilt set on fire, and the third floor opposite was also affected. Fortunately, the rescue was quick, preventing further disaster. A small part of the third floor of No. 74 to the right caught fire, but fortunately, it did not spread.

Efforts to Extinguish Fire Result in Injured Firefighters

Upon receiving the report, the Central Fire Station and the Western District fire substations dispatched fire engines, totaling six. However, as the fire occurred during water supply restrictions, firefighters had to wait for the Waterworks Department to open the water valve for about ten minutes after setting up the hoses before the water source arrived. During the efforts to extinguish the fire, a firefighter from Fire Brigade No. 44 was struck in the right eye by falling wood. By 4:10 AM, the fire had been somewhat contained, but the entire building had been burned to the top. Around 5:00 AM, the firefighters gradually packed up and returned to the station. Only an engineering vehicle remained at the scene to excavate.

Total Losses Exceed Ten Thousand Dollars

The entire building was destroyed by the fire, resulting in considerable losses. Wai Wah Tailors on the ground floor suffered losses estimated at over two thousand dollars. Zhen Guang Jewelry Store suffered losses estimated at six thousand dollars. It is said that both Wai Wah and Zhen Guang had purchased insurance from a certain insurance company, but the amount is unknown. Losses on the second and third floors were estimated at around one thousand dollars each. Fortunately, Man Sun Chinese and Western Printing on the ground floor of No. 74 was not affected, suffering only water damage estimated at a few hundred dollars. The second floor also suffered slight losses, while the third floor suffered losses of around one hundred dollars due to a small part being burned. It is estimated that the total losses exceeded ten thousand dollars. The cause of the fire is subject to various speculations, with some saying it was caused by a fire left unattended in Wai Wah Tailors, while others said it was caused by embers blown into the shop from the Lian Kee porridge stall at the street corner. The exact cause is unknown. When questioned, people in the shop all said that they saw the fire raging as soon as they got up. Police detectives are investigating the cause of the fire.

Firefighter Imprisoned for Theft

Also, during the fire, while firefighters were using a hose from the second floor of No. 47 opposite, British police officer Taylor was standing guard on the second-floor staircase. He then saw firefighter Hu Shi walk out of the middle room and down the stairs. Suspecting him, Taylor followed him and saw Hu take something out of his pocket on Lyndhurst Terrace and hand it to a waterworks department hose worker, Li Fu. Taylor immediately apprehended both men and discovered that the object was a woman's bracelet. He took both men to the police station and handed them over to the Central Magistracy for trial yesterday morning. Hu was charged with stealing a bracelet belonging to Luo Xin-zhen, while Li was charged with receiving stolen goods. The judge sentenced Hu to three months in prison for abusing trust and intending to commit misconduct. The second defendant, who had served the government for 23 years and did not have adequate time to consider, was released on bail of one hundred dollars.

Po Leung Kuk Reaches Record Number of Residents

Sheltering Women and Children Exceeding Two Hundred The Po Leung Kuk in Hong Kong was established to shelter poor and helpless women and children. In the past, the number of women and children sheltered in the Kuk never exceeded twenty or thirty. However, since October of last year, the number of women and children admitted to the Kuk has been increasing daily, recently reaching over two hundred, more than ten times the previous number, setting an unprecedented record. Yesterday, a reporter spoke with Mr. Chan Po-yin, the first director of the Kuk, who said that eight years ago, when they built the new Po Leung Kuk on Caroline Hill Road, the number of women and children sheltered in the Kuk on Po Yan Street was only thirty. They only equipped it with one hundred beds. He learned that by early spring of this year, the number of admissions had exceeded one hundred, so they added 58 beds in the spare rooms to increase capacity. However, recently, the number of people arriving at the Kuk has reached over two hundred, and the original 158 beds are no longer sufficient. At the same time, there is also a shortage of funds. He reported the situation to the Secretary for Chinese Affairs, who requested assistance from the highest authorities, and it was approved that the Po Leung Kuk's expenses would be increased by 17,000 dollars this year.

Youth Drama Association Formally Established Yesterday; Performance of National Defense Drama

The Hong Kong Youth Drama Association, jointly organized by youth drama groups from Hong Kong and Kowloon, held its inauguration ceremony at the Wah Nam Middle School last night, after months of preparation. More than ten drama groups participated. In addition to inviting veteran figures in the drama industry, such as Ou-yang Yu-qian, Cai Chu-sheng, Hu Chun-bing, and Situ Hui-min, to provide guidance, they also performed national defense plays "A Corner of North China" and "Survival in Death," with great enthusiasm.

Hong Kong Governor's New Year Message

The Governor of Hong Kong recently released a New Year message, saying: "I sincerely believe that 1939 is the beginning of a new outlook for the world. Recently, the forces of humanity and kindness have gained repeated advantages to oppose inhuman violence. On this auspicious occasion of New Year's Day, we can use 'Open Hearts' as our slogan." January 1, 1939, Geoffrey Northcote, Governor's House.

Yesterday's Football Results; Today, South China A vs. Eastern

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, South China A played against Kowloon Club in a special Silver Shield football match at the Kowloon Association Ground. Because the field was narrow, South China A's short passing skills were difficult to execute and were often broken by the Kowloon Club's defenders with their dense defense. Although South China A often created opportunities, they always missed the final shot. After 70 minutes of fierce play, neither side scored. The game went into overtime, but there was still no record, ending in a 0-0 draw. A replay will be held on another day to determine the winner. Also, South China B was eliminated 3-0 by Western District Engineering, which was also an unexpected result.

### Meeting with Mr. Tao Xingzhi; Extensive Discussions on Various Educational Issues During Wartime

— Zhu Qizhuo

Special Report from Our Newspaper

Mentioning the name "Tao Xingzhi" easily brings to mind his special style of "profound yet accessible, both solemn and humorous."

The reporter learned that Mr. Tao had come to Hong Kong from Guilin, so he visited the Kowloon Children's College the day before yesterday afternoon. After a lively conversation with Mr. Fang Yu-yan, Mr. Tao entered the reception room with his briefcase in hand.

Mr. Tao is somewhat stout and has a plump face, but he doesn't look like a wealthy old man. His hair is cut short and flat, like a student in training. He wears an old-fashioned Chinese gown over his Zhongshan suit, covered with the marks of travel. He is full of energy and amiable, a typical approachable and relaxed educator.

After a brief greeting, Mr. Tao kindly answered the reporter's questions with a smile.

"The Life Education Society has a history of more than ten years and has done a lot of work. It was only officially registered and re-launched in Guilin on the 15th of this month."

Hearing "only officially registered" is so inspiring! The "War of Resistance" is truly worthy of praise. It has cleared away all the shadows of past "misunderstandings" and "misconceptions."

Mr. Tao continued:

"The Life Education Society has been involved in several movements. Initially, targeting the backwardness of the vast countryside, we launched the Rural Education Movement. In the cities, to correct the privatization and monopoly of education, we launched the Universal Education Movement. When the × invaders encroached step by step and Chinese traitors were rampant in North China, facing national crisis, we coordinated National Salvation Education with the needs of the time. When the War of Resistance began, everything had to be subordinate to the War of Resistance. National Salvation Education evolved into War of Resistance Education. The current stage of the War of Resistance is a comprehensive war, so we must now launch comprehensive education to meet the needs of the comprehensive War of Resistance. The main task of comprehensive education is to extend education to our front lines and behind the × invaders, not only to the youth and able-bodied men, but also to children and old women! ... Although the forms of these movements are different, their core is only one, which is the Universal Education Movement. However, it has developed with the development of the objective situation..."

In a very brief conversation, he painted a clear historical progression of China's new education history. Mr. Tao's spirit of advancing with the times is manifested from this.

What is the purpose of Life Education? Mr. Tao succinctly said:

1. To raise the standard of living

2. To inspire alertness

3. To cultivate creativity

This is undoubtedly China's most urgent task today. Mr. Tao then spoke about the mountain cave schools recently developed in Guangxi. According to Mr. Tao, during air raids, almost half of the people in Guilin were in mountain caves. It is a pity to spend several hours or even a whole day in the caves to avoid airplanes without doing anything. The possibility of cave education is because, first, caves are natural and safe classrooms, requiring no construction costs. Second, people automatically come forward, so there is no need to worry about students. Third, there are all kinds of people among the refugees, so there is no need to worry about a lack of knowledge to serve as teachers in the caves. The content of the cave school curriculum is the knowledge of resistance and various skills of resistance that should be learned by people of all ages and genders. Now, the Guangxi Provincial Government is actively training instructors for cave schools. Cave schools are also part of Life Education. For example, when an old woman has a load on her shoulders and has to pull a child with both hands, young people should help carry the child and help carry things, so that the old and young can take shelter properly. This kind of "service" is the spirit of Life Education. In other words, Life Education should "follow the people." Follow them into the caves, follow them into the forests, follow them to...wherever they go. All the principles and methods are derived from the five words "follow the people." However, it is not just following the people in their escape, but to organize a coherent system from the chaotic escape crowd, to concentrate the scattered forces, and to turn the refugees into soldiers.

Mr. Tao also told the reporter a new good news, which is that the Xiaozhuang Research Institute will be established in Guilin to conduct educational research in various places. All educational issues that arise during wartime, such as military education issues, youth education issues, wounded soldier education issues, refugee education issues, etc., are all urgent educational issues that need to be researched, and it is necessary to provide implementation plans for the government and all parties to refer to and implement. Mr. Tao's task on this trip to Hong Kong is to prepare everything.

This is indeed welcome and comforting news. The rebirth of Xiaozhuang symbolizes the dawn of education and the revival of the nation.

Hundreds of knowledge-seeking young people were already waiting for Mr. Tao's lecture in the auditorium outside. The reporter did not dare to delay Mr. Tao's valuable time any longer. Finally, he asked Mr. Tao if he had written any new poems recently. Mr. Tao happily agreed to the reporter's request and immediately took out his pen to write two poems for the reporter:

The first sound I heard upon arriving in Hong Kong, from the mouths of children, was "Shen Bao is good":

Two coppers for a mother and child, indeed rejuvenating

Every New Year I think of old friends, regretting that the talented died too early,

I long to let you know that the Eastern devils should be scared in the world

New Year's Remembrance

Shi Gong measures talent and wishes Shen Bao unlimited future

Tao Xingzhi (28/901)

A Glimpse of Life Education

Greens, tofu, brown rice;

Also watch, think, talk, play, do,

Awaken 450 million,

Prepare for the war of aggression!

Song of Civil and Military Assimilation

Civilians become militarized,

Military becomes civilized,

Civil and military are assimilated without being either civil or military,

Civilians no longer scold each other,

Soldiers no longer fight,

Unite,

To create a new world.

### Chinese Art Progressive Association Sends Off the Old and Welcomes the New at a Social Gathering; Unanimously Condemns Wang Jingwei, Who Surrendered to the × Invaders

— Qi Zhuo

Special

The brightly lit white electric lights shrouded the long, rectangular restaurant. Sixty-odd art lovers and enthusiasts of national salvation work held a social gathering on New Year's Eve.

The lively laughter transformed into a solemn atmosphere. First, Mr. Qu Eding delivered an opening speech, explaining that the dinner was both a year-end social gathering, a review of work, and an opportunity to solicit members' opinions and develop work for the new year. Next, the chairman of the association, Mr. Du Rizhang, gave a speech. Although he was an elder in a long gown and mandarin jacket, he shouted "Resistance to the end" targeted at the current situation. The young friends responded with a warm round of applause.

Following this, the advisors of the association, introduced by the chairman, stood up one after another to express their views:

Mr. Liu Simu said, "The current situation has created waves, and Hong Kong is the center of the waves. Pro-peace advocates and Japanese agents have come to Hong Kong. We must unite, guide the masses to recognize the situation, and smash the conspiracies of the pro-peace faction and the aggressors." This was a very pertinent appeal at this moment. Mr. Jin Ji-hua analyzed the heroic war efforts of the past year, from tragedy to dawn, from shaking to stability. Wang Jingwei's surrender and betrayal was the most tense political crisis of the year. However, the current difficult situation will certainly be overcome and eliminated by the joint efforts of the entire nation, just as before. The New Year means that we must work hard to overcome this final difficulty. At this moment, we are infinitely excited.

Mr. Cai Chusheng spoke more vividly and interestingly. He said that the world is like a stage, and there are always two aspects to the drama on the stage: the protagonist and the antagonist. Japanese aggression is certainly the antagonist, and China's war for freedom and independence is certainly the protagonist. The antagonist in a play must fail, and the end of Japan is naturally also a matter in the drama.

As for the domestic political stage, the protagonist and the antagonist are not so easy to distinguish. Therefore, the lead actor on the stage is rehearsing very hard, and we, the audience, are also confused. What a few gentlemen said about "waves" and "tense political crises"...actually, this is the best situation. There is no doubt that the antagonist on the domestic political stage will also fail. The pro-peace, compromise antagonist leader is blinded and cannot see the nation and justice. Now, we, the descendants of the Chinese nation, the righteous elements, whether we are the lead actor, supporting actor, minor character, or even backstage workers, must work together to wipe out the role of the antagonist. As for the audience in the audience, they must also cheer loudly. The exposure of Wang Jingwei's true face as an antagonist is absolutely beneficial to the War of Resistance and to China.

These words were very appropriate and fitting when said by the playwright Mr. Cai, and they were also witty and amusing when said at this gathering of artists. A burst of applause and knowing smiles followed.

Mr. Situ Huimin also said: Division, disintegration, and crises occurring at this time are even more cause to congratulate the New Year, because without this, there would be no process of elimination, and politics would not be clarified.

Mr. Wang Jiyuan and Mr. Lin Huanping also spoke, denouncing Wang Jingwei's betrayal of history and his reckless declaration of compromise without any mercy. If Mr. Wang were present, it is unknown how he would explain himself.

The advisors' speeches had already taken up a lot of time, so everyone relaxed the atmosphere of the gathering and enjoyed their meal, while members freely expressed their opinions and gave cordial encouragement, making people more alert and motivated.

The social gathering came to a close, and the arduous old year quietly passed. With lessons learned and mutual encouragement, everyone excitedly began to develop new work. The victorious and bright New Year has also come to the world.

### New Year's Reflections

— Ouyang Yuqian

Last year I spent New Year's in Shanghai, and this year I'm spending it in Hong Kong. I've been running around since I was a child, and I've long been a person of the east, west, north, and south. It's all the same to me wherever I spend New Year's. Moreover, in recent years, I've never taken New Year's or birthdays to heart. If people didn't mention them, I would definitely forget.

The joy of New Year's exists only in childhood memories, as if it were yesterday. Since leaving home in my teens, I can say that I haven't had a stable New Year's. I even feel that New Year's is troublesome when I'm feeling bored. But one year always brings about a settlement, closing the old books and starting new ones. Businessmen hope that their businesses will be more prosperous, and artists also hope to contribute more. New Year's is not without meaning. However, there are many people who simply copy old articles and don't feel that New Year's is new.

With each passing New Year, humanity becomes more advanced, but for individuals, as the number of New Years passes, the beauty of youth begins to fade, and the artist's thoughts begin to solidify. This is a kind of sadness, but there are also people who maintain their youth forever and advance with the times, as long as they are not content to stagnate at one stage.

Ambitionists often try to hinder the progress of the times for their own selfish interests, and they do not hesitate to use cruel means to carry out their views. They even want to return the lives of all mankind to before the fifteenth century, to turn most people into ignorant and unknowing people, so that a few people can rule them. Revolution and war are conceived and nurtured here, so fascism is war.

Thousands of years of policies of keeping the people ignorant have created the Ah Q character of the Chinese people and have also fostered the habit of corruption. Those who offer advice are ridiculed; the eight-legged essay and test post poem are also methods of repression. The attitude of "if you're not crazy or deaf, you can't be a father-in-law" is used to play the role of a corrupt official's family slave. This leads to a philosophy of life of being content with one's lot and not interfering in things, and in short, an idea of each person sweeping the snow from their own doorstep, which has caused the nation to become a heap of loose sand, thereby inviting the idea of invasion from powerful neighbors. So this time's tragedy was already lurking before the abolition of the stereotyped essay! However, even recently, I personally heard a certain important person say to me, "...now it is important to focus on training the masses, and not to talk about organizing the masses. If you organize the masses but cannot lead them, then having an organization is worse than not having one." Perhaps he thought that it would be difficult to use his personal intentions to rule if the masses were organized? The fall of some famous cities was not without this reason. However, the Chinese people are gradually awakening.

This year's New Year is a New Year of great turning point. Everyone recognizes that China's anti-aggression war is a long-term war, and at the same time, the world's anti-fascist war has also brewed to a considerable temperature. The garbage and filth accumulated by history will be given a general cleaning. "Oh, great era!" Can we just sigh and be done with it?

I serve in the drama industry, so naturally I can't help but have plans for the drama industry. What plans? In short, the oppressor will only oppress as much as possible, and the oppressed will only resist desperately. There is no possibility of compromise between them. We only need to ask ourselves if we are prepared and if we are standing firmly in our positions. We don't need to ask whether the bombs will fall on us. A month ago, I was still wondering if professional theater groups could survive if the scope of the war were to expand. Now I no longer think about this issue. When the giant wheels of the times roll over, some cells will become particularly healthy due to the effects of metabolism, while others will die or be injured. It is like treating a disease with surgery. There will inevitably be skin breaking and bleeding. To remove rotten flesh, some good flesh will inevitably be injured. However, the disease cannot be cured without doing so. China is undergoing major surgery, and the world is also going to have a tumor treated because it has a fascist disease. We are all small cells, and when we encounter a time to sacrifice, we will not begrudge anything. Moreover, the drama movement is precisely a movement to eliminate corruption and create new life. I wish you a happy New Year!

### New Year's Musings

— Sen Yu

Rambling about the Great Gambling of Japan

With the arrival of the New Year, many people seem to think of gambling. The New Year seems to be a season for gambling. Even the police officers who usually rely on catching gamblers to earn "extra income" will pretend not to see when someone opens their doors and vigorously shuffles tiles. Sometimes, they even "personally go to the front lines."

Speaking of gambling, we can't help but think of the gambling habits of the Japanese. There is ample evidence of the Japanese national character's fondness for gambling. Ms. E. M. Gull, the author of "Japan's Foothold in the Mud," recently published another book titled "Japan Gambling in China." Indeed, Japan is now betting its entire national fortune.

Those who go to Japan can see the proliferation of "mahjong parlors" on the streets. Openly indulging in gambling, ostensibly for leisure, is not considered gambling, but the hidden imports and exports are significant. The so-called "Western culture" of "poker" is particularly popular in Japan and has many variations, becoming "Western gambling." A few times, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department launched "financial prisons," and many students were detained and fined, especially famous swimmers from Rikkyo University, mostly because "their awareness of emergency situations was insufficient." It's not to say that they are inherently like this.

Friends in Shanghai who frequent North Sichuan Road will have seen large groups of Japanese people hiring cars from various car rental companies around 7 or 8 o'clock in the evening. All the cars are rented out, and they urge the drivers to drive as fast as possible. I asked the car rental company's staff, and they said that they all drive to the dog racing and jai alai courts. Some car rental companies can cover their expenses just by doing this business.

We also know that in places like Tianjin and Shanghai, gambling has always been rampant. Most of the behind-the-scenes bosses of the casinos are Japanese ronin, and this is even more true now. It's not just these; even smuggling, drug trafficking, and counterfeiting are all forms of disguised gambling. Before they used force for protection, Japanese ronin were already engaged in these activities, hoping to get rich quickly. However, when they are caught and confiscated, it is like a desperate gamble.

Now, Japan is putting the entire country into the gambling circle. Gamblers often squander their family property, even selling their wives' bracelets, rings, and children's savings, even winter clothing. Japan's current situation is already similar to this. The gambling stakes—two million young men who can be mobilized to the front lines—have already lost at least one-third, and the wealth lost is worth hundreds of millions, with cash running out soon. What has been gained? A lottery ticket that is always worthless and never wins!

The Japanese people already know that such a big gamble is not a joke. They have been forcibly dragged into this big gambling game by the warlords. Mr. Aoki lost his life, Mr. Tanaka lost a son, Mr. Yamakawa lost a leg, and children are lost one after another… One day, they will lose the entire country. Gamblers often coax and coerce their fathers and wives for gambling money, eventually leading to family ruin. Even when the day of jumping into the sea is near, they are still unwilling to give up. However, the purses of fathers and wives also have limits, and one day they will show the unfilial gambler their "true colors." Wait and see, wait for the gambler's doomsday. Talking about gambling in the New Year, perhaps 1939 will be the year the Japanese gambler "jumps into the sea."

### Ode to Cooperation

New Year's Message

Happy New Year! Happy New Year!

New Year's Day is a good day. Whether we are indoors or walking on the street, we all put on a smiling face. If you want to laugh, you can laugh. When you meet relatives and friends, you have to bow and salute. If you want to say some auspicious words, this year doesn't forbid saying auspicious words. "Longevity" and "Congratulations on having a baby" are still useful. It's best to add "Serve the country" and "Victory, victory!" In short, it means being happy and not forgetting national affairs.

New Year's Day is a good day. Generally, people are used to pasting a "welcoming spring" character on this day of the lunar calendar. Red paper with black characters, writing "A Harmony of Unity." Please change this "welcoming spring" character to be pasted today. Although the season is not spring, it is the height of winter, but what does "welcoming spring" and "welcoming winter" have to do with it? The important thing is to take the meaning of the words, "A Harmony of Unity"! Yes, family members, fathers and sons, from today on, do not quarrel. For those outside the family, even if they were once mortal enemies, old foes, they should make peace, respect each other. This year requires 450 million people to be of one heart and one mind, without a trace of grudges.

New Year's Day is a good day. All the officials, big and small, throughout the country must give Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang their utmost respect, a deep bow of more than fifty degrees, and then give each other one as well, as if at some kind of meeting, colleagues and comrades, without any separation, hug tightly and give each other a kiss. It must also be taken as normal, and not be alarmed. This year requires everyone to hold hands tightly, forming a perfect circle. No one is allowed to leave the circle. This game is only allowed to rest for a while, but not allowed to secretly walk away dejectedly. Anyone who steals away, everyone will not consider them a good fellow, and ask them to get lost far away. Because at this time, what is there that cannot be discussed? Your walking away is not taking your stubbornness.

New Year's Day is a good day. Leaders of all parties and factions across the country, let's have a happy gathering too! You have either made peace or made new friends in the past year and a half. Although everyone has their own articles, they are not completely unrelated. Under the great pen of that old gentleman of the era, they are all densely circled and dotted, applauding and cheering. He once shook his head and recited it loudly, and it has already received the praise and admiration of 450 million people. So, taking advantage of this good day, shouldn't you gather together and clink glasses? Or, because the road is far away, even if there are planes, there is no time to come, you should also write a New Year's card and send it to each other. On it, write: "Sincere unity, build a new China!" As for what public letter that long masterpiece, that is not needed!

New Year's Day is a good day. We go out early in the morning, facing the direction of great fortune, welcoming external happiness. As long as people are happy with me, I will consider them good friends. Taking advantage of such a day, give a deep bow. Although we are not newly acquainted, there is no need to be polite. But in this year, it is not a time of day in the middle of the sky. There are some shadows on all sides. If everyone is a friend, then we should walk together in several columns. Today, we hope to have a large gathering. There must be five roles in the meeting: one is a burly man wearing a red hat, one is a young girl wearing a three-colored scarf, one is a high-class gentleman wearing a dress with the British flag, one is a famous guest full of gold coins, and the last one, ashamed, ashamed, is our old fellow. In addition to these five key roles, there are countless children of God. Everyone faces the cross and offers a prayer for peace. Then, everyone takes out their box cannons and fires three shots at the shadows, as a salute to welcome the new year.

My ode is finished. I am happy for my ode.

### How the Japanese People Spend the New Year

— Fei Dan

The Japanese warlords have always told the Japanese people that China has vast land and abundant resources. As long as China is annexed, they can live a comfortable life! At the same time, they also told the Japanese people that the Chinese nation is aging and declining, and has been a subjugated people many times in history. Annexation is extremely easy. Needless to say, everyone knows that this war is their greatest effort to pursue an easily obtained comfortable life. Now, the war has been going on for a year and a half, but what the Japanese people have gained is only double the Vienna rent, a public debt burden of nearly a million, and a general mobilization law that swallows the entire people's economic and political freedom. In addition, there is a pitch-black future.

Now it is the second New Year after the outbreak of the war!

Speaking of celebrating the New Year, in normal times, the Japanese people are worthy of being described as "bright and beautiful" because the Japanese usually love cleanliness. Of course, they will be doubly cleaned up for the New Year. Every house has tall pines erected in front of the door up to the second floor; bright paper pictures are hung up; women and children wear brightly colored new clothes; everyone gives each other paper gifts with packaging, but there is nothing inside; when relatives and neighbors meet, they constantly bow with unnatural laughter, saying endless New Year's greetings. In the eyes of us foreigners, it is quite bright and beautiful.

Today, after a year and a half of war, do the Japanese people still have such a bright and beautiful New Year?

The Japanese people hope that the war will end soon, but in fact, the war is becoming more protracted. Most of the healthy sons that parents have worked so hard to raise are sent to the battlefield, and only packages of "silent triumphant" ashes are returned, or "white-clad warriors" with missing limbs. Very few can return healthy. This has already cast a layer of gray over our hearts. At the same time, their daily necessities, clothing, paper, food, gifts, etc., have all been controlled by the government and cannot be discussed casually. This is to prepare for war and to help the public digest the public debt. Even if they really want to buy something, they have no money. Now, the Japanese government has the fact that pensions for retired personnel and condolence money for the war dead are given in the form of public bonds instead of currency! So recently, a Japanese newspaper published a cartoon depicting many Japanese people wearing short, tattered clothes, with sad faces.

Every New Year, the Japanese people, whether men, women, old, or young, must go to the "shrine," throw a copper coin into the shrine money box, clap their hands twice, and close their eyes to pray silently for a while. In the past, of course, they hoped that the New Year would be better than the old year, with family peace and health, and told their wishes to the "gods" they believed in. But this year, if they cannot but go to the shrine to throw coins, clap their hands, and pray in form, I think they must say this: "God! I curse you, you are helping the ferocious warlords, putting our sons into another world; we have lost freedom and happiness, turning the bright New Year into a dull one?"

### Ah Q's Victory

— Si Mu

The New Year should be a time for auspicious words, so I will talk about Ah Q's victory.

The spittle from cursing people for "swimming back and forth" has not yet dried, and one's own nose is bruised, so one has slipped away to Hanoi first! This kind of "slippery-away-ism" already has quite the spirit of Ah Q.

It's not just that. When "noisy people" saw the mysterious news of "relapse of old illness," opinions were divided, some with veiled sarcasm, leaving some leeway, and some simply treated it as a dog drowning in water. However, "Mr. So-and-so," who is known for his literary talent and eloquence, has not yet said a word to clarify. Perhaps this is also what Lu Xun called "silence is the greatest weapon"?

What's even stranger is that a certain newspaper, which claims to be a faithful spokesman for "Mr.," is also keeping silent about this matter. Not long ago, it repeatedly said that "Chairman Chiang's advocacy is Mr.'s advocacy." Now, however, a Reuters news report quoting Chairman Chiang's explanation on the anniversary that "Mr.'s" departure from Chongqing was purely a personal action was boldly cut out by it! Naturally, the section about "Mr." was deleted, and even the full text of Chairman Chiang's instructions, as pointed out by the Central News Agency, cannot be found in the newspaper (at least not until today). What is the intention of this? The silence has reached the point of burying one's head in the sand, alas.

Perhaps the news agency was afraid of hurting the feelings of its colleagues and deliberately did not send this official news report? But it is definitely not "due to space constraints." Because on the same day, the newspaper published a letter from Zhang Junmai to Mao Zedong in large print and took the opportunity to curse the Chinese Communist Party. In this way, it spat again and achieved another victory, even if it is "Ah Q's victory."

However, yesterday's newspaper reported that "Mr.'s" great disciple, who had tracked him to Hong Kong, said that "Mr." was going abroad "actually on an important national mission." If the "government" is still the Chongqing government, then the speaker either did not see the excerpt of Chairman Chiang's instructions in the newspaper on the 28th because he was in a hurry, or thought that it could not be seen with this excuse. However, there was finally an "opinionated" answer. Ah Q has won again.

We waited for a long time, and finally saw Mr.'s speech on the 31st of last year. Strangely enough, it was like a duet with someone else, with different tunes but the same skill. This is simply not the kind of words that a Chinese person would say. Some people say that he has already put up a straw marker for sale. Other than that, we cannot find any other reason for him to make such a speech.

New Year's Issue of Film and Drama Magazine

### Memories of Darkness and Bright Prospects for Film and Drama Theory

— Cai Fensheng

Turning the pages of Chinese film history, in these short twenty-nine years, although experiencing ups and downs, in essence, even from the slump between 1926 and 1930, there has never been such a rapid decline as in the past year and a half since the Anti-Japanese War (naturally, in terms of direction), which every sincere film and cultural worker cannot help but feel pained and indignant about!

Today, apart from the China Film Studio and the Central Photography Studio, which, with the support of artists, are gloriously shouldering the cinematic mission in the Anti-Japanese War, the national film revival climax triggered by the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents, which followed from 1930, was completely extinguished after the fierce outbreak of self-defense in the Anti-Japanese War from "July 7th" to "August 13th"!

What an "abnormal" phenomenon!

Here, to understand why Chinese films have embarked on an "abnormal" path, we must first touch on the issue of capital: We know that film is listed as one of the major industries in the world, so the conditions for creating a film are by no means as simple as those of other artistic fields. From the beginning, making a film to its completion, it requires close cooperation with a large amount of capital at all times; however, Chinese film merchants have always maintained the operating methods of the Chinese handicraft industry, only clinging to the old ways without exploring new avenues. Their management is neither active nor their vision sharp—or if they are, they develop in an extremely bad direction, betraying the essence of film and exploiting the blood and sweat of workers to fill their own pockets. Under such management, when faced with the storms of a great era, the former naturally cannot resist and collapses immediately, while the latter, with disordered tactics, do whatever they want; it is difficult to find someone who can act as a pillar of support. This is the first reason. Secondly, we must consider the issue of talent. We know that the history of Chinese film development is relatively short, and the earliest films were still embryonic forms of civilized drama and Peking Opera—in the south, Cantonese opera. During these ten years or so, not even a sound specialized training institution for film talent had emerged. Therefore, most of the workers were "halfway converts," lacking in cultivation and skill—a widespread common ailment (I am one of the most inadequate and unskilled). Not to mention the literary foundation and understanding of the world and human life that an artist should have, even ordinary common sense sometimes becomes a major problem. Workers like this account for the largest percentage. Therefore, in times of turmoil, few are not at a loss, and some even unknowingly take the opposite path. This is the second reason.

Based on the above two reasons, the Chinese film industry after the Anti-Japanese War was bound to create tragic results. This is an inevitable law.

Facts tell us that after Shanghai fell into the so-called "isolated island" status, its role as a film and cultural center also shifted west to Wuhan—now it should be Chongqing (although Hong Kong produces many films, in terms of quality, it cannot replace Shanghai as the center because it is not related to culture—especially Anti-Japanese War culture). With knowledgeable workers being absorbed there, those who remain only care about making a living. After being exploited by capitalists with "ingenious theories," they diligently engage in making spiritually numbing and harmful monster, horror, erotic, and sensual productions to divert the public's attention from resisting Japan. Given the universality and depth of film's influence, its impact on the prospects of the Anti-Japanese War and the weakening of the government's ability to undertake this arduous long-term resistance is immeasurable!

Furthermore, regarding Hong Kong, the production environment has never been affected. Therefore, in the early stages, a few national defense films were produced—although not entirely sound, they are now considered precious. However, due to the inevitable shortcomings of both capital and talent, the entire film market was quickly controlled by so-called "folk tales" unearthed from decadent wooden fish books and fishermen's songs. On the other hand, they desperately engage in the production of obscene and erotic films. Following this, so-called monster and horror films followed one after another, and the atmosphere of miasma was even worse than in Shanghai. Given the large number of Cantonese films produced and the wide range of their sales, the adverse effects are even more unimaginable!

In summary, the privately-owned film industry, which accounts for more than 80% of the entire Chinese film industry, has declined so much—most of them can even be said to be "used by capital." Then, can the output of the China Film Studio and the Central Photography Studio, which accounts for less than 20%, support the great national self-defense war by publicizing the significance of the Anti-Japanese War and encouraging the emotions of resistance to the vast domestic and foreign audiences? We must painfully point out that this is not enough, not nearly enough! We must painfully point out that the propaganda effect of these few productions is not enough to "counteract" those poisonous films!

When the crisis of survival of a nation has reached its extreme, and its people—especially those who hold intellectual positions and are responsible for guiding and educating the public, the film workers, not only do not provide assistance but instead—it can be said that most of them are destroying it as if they fear they won't succeed quickly enough—is this something that normal human feelings can fathom? Here, we want to cry injustice for the millions of brave soldiers on the front lines who are enduring hunger and cold while fighting bloody battles—we want to cry injustice for the hundreds of thousands of soldiers who sacrificed their precious lives to defend the motherland—we want to cry injustice for the tens of millions of compatriots who are struggling in piles of corpses and seas of blood because of the bombing and destruction by the invaders!

We have endless tears to shed and tongues that cannot be severed. We have no personal grievances, nor do we talk about private interests. We only point out all the mistakes with blood sincerity, hoping that every Chinese child who does not want to be a slave will awaken, awaken, and awaken again!

In fact, if the film workers themselves are not awake, we should honestly and bluntly say: the masses have long been awake. We have not encountered any ordinary audience who does not vehemently scold these poisonous films and constantly looks forward to the emergence of national defense films or meaningful films—and the news from the vast overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia shows that there is no place that does not express deep resentment towards these poisonous films—as evidenced by the fact that the masses have destroyed theaters showing poisonous films on more than one occasion, and theater staff have even gone on strike to oppose the showing of poisonous films. Other textual expressions are countless. These should be facts that are heard by the ears and seen by the eyes!

Here, we should deeply believe that if national defense films (if the correct writing has problems, you can use oblique writing. We want to revive the form of national defense films) were to appear, they would definitely be warmly welcomed by the broad audience. In other words, they would be able to "gain both fame and fortune" and "make big money"—because the people's prayer for the liberation of the Republic of China is so eager—they need to use this to obtain comfort, stimulation, and encouragement for their passion to resist Japan!

Recently, Chairman Chiang publicly stated: Today, after a year and a half of the Anti-Japanese War, we not only have solutions for military affairs and diplomacy, but also for the economy. Our strength is thirty times stronger than before the Anti-Japanese War. There is no doubt that the final victory will belong to us! But in the second phase of the war, as we get closer to victory, the hardships we face will be even greater. Our film workers should firmly believe that "the Anti-Japanese War will definitely be won, and the nation will definitely be built," and live up to the commander-in-chief's expectations that every citizen must "do their best" and "make the most of everything." Stop hesitating and decisively cast aside the meaningless concepts that are criticized by millions of people, face forward, and catch up!

The year 1938 has passed before today. Let all the decadent, obscene, anti-war, and even destructive things pass with the old days! We want to create our new life! We want to stand firmly on the front line of the nation and bear the responsibilities that every Chinese film worker should bear!

The year 1939 begins after today. The sun shines before our eyes, and the light beckons us!

I only call to the north and south with great enthusiasm:

Long live the awakened film artists!

Long live the liberation of the Republic of China!

Editor's Note

For this special New Year's issue, we originally intended to dedicate a large space to conduct a more detailed examination of the film and theater circles over the past year. We are extremely grateful to all the gentlemen who took time out of their busy schedules to write articles for our publication. Unfortunately, due to space constraints, many great works could not be published. Mr. Ouyang Yuqian's great work has been moved to "Free Talk," and Mr. Fan Jia's "The Activity of Hong Kong's Dramatic Movement in the Past Year," Mr. Zhu Baishui's "New Plans for Hong Kong's Performing Arts in 1938," and other articles had to be left for the next issue. For this, we feel very sorry for the authors and readers. I hereby record these few words to express my apologies and hope that the authors and readers will deeply forgive us! . Editor.

The Hong Kong Film Industry in the Past Year
— Lu Dun

Last year, after New Year's Day, our sacred national self-defense war entered a new stage. The determination to resist Japan to the end and the firm belief in the final victory gave us unlimited excitement; similarly, at almost the same time, Cantonese films in Hong Kong entered a new chapter. However, this turning point in Cantonese films not only failed to excite us but also made us feel extremely disappointed! Because the direction of this transformation did not match the current political situation. In the past year, most of the film producers not only failed to fulfill the tasks that they should have undertaken during the Anti-Japanese War but instead took the opposite path. In the past year, most of the films produced were so-called "folk tales," which were once appreciated by the invaders as "the most suitable for the Kingly Way"!

In the past year, about eighty Cantonese films were produced in Hong Kong; more than sixty have been released. The list is as follows:

Nanyang Tianyi Company:——

Joyful Reunion, General Long Bofei, Clouds Over the Pacific, Separated Family, Pulled Rickshaw Humiliated, Woman's Sutra, Broken Lingzhi, Film World Romance, Zixia Cup, Female Warrior, Sanniang Draws Water, June Frost, Suffering Ends, Filial Piety to the Mother-in-Law by Abandoning the Son, Pipa Song, Overwhelming, Enchanting Sister, Liu Manling

Daguan Company:——

Universal Celebration, Commanding the Twelve Hairpins of the Golden House, Tears of Compassion, Hundred Thousand Lovers, New Citizen, Melee, Four Sons Join the Army, Shanghai Frontline, Wandering Father, Seven Fresh Roses, Stage Romance, Orphan's Journey

Nanyue Company:——

Seeing the Light of Day Again, Seven Stars Accompanying the Moon, Playboy Tycoon, Compatriot Brothers, General Peach Blossom, Extraordinary Woman, Rouge Tears, Magistrate Mei

Shanyue Company:——

Golden Chrysanthemum, Public Enemy, Yan Ruisheng, Firewood, Rice, Oil, Salt, Sauce, Vinegar, and Tea

Zhongnan Glory Company:——

Eight Hundred Warriors, Flowery Radish, Chen Wannian's Reincarnated Marriage, Chen Shimei Does Not Recognize His Wife, Fang Shiyu, Meng Qingjun, A Good Woman Marries Eighteen Times

Other Companies:——

Red Actors Gather to Sing, Begging for Rice to Support Mother-in-Law, Love and Tears in the War, Flower Seller, Rogue Miss, Peach-Colored Spy, Flesh and Blood Great Wall, Jian's Marriage Against Difficulty in Finding a Loving Husband, Matching the Mandarin Ducks, Truly Miserly, Money is to Blame, One Night Couple, Powdered Building

Filmed but Not Yet Released:——

Female Ghost, Night Light Cup, Mouth Flower Flower, Modern Prodigal Son (Above from Nanyang, Tianyi Company)

Sequel to Seven Fresh Roses, Record of the Filial Son Who Escaped Punishment, Singer Bai Mudan (Above from Daguan Company) Xiangjiang Flower Moon Night, Plum Blossoms Twice (Above from Nanyue Company) Sequel to Golden Purple Chrysanthemum (Shanyue Company)

Peach Blossom Woman's Door Method (Zhongnan Glory Company) Jealousy Flower Wind and Rain, Spring Love Passion Fire, Ten Thousand Acres of Walking Corpses

Modern Woman Seeks Husband, Guerrilla March, Zhuang Zhou's Butterfly Dream, The Last Companion (Above belong to small companies)

According to the investigation in the list above, the films belonging to "folk tales" account for the largest number, followed by ethical and erotic elements, and films with defensive awareness account for the fewest.

We do not object to using folk tales as the theme of films, because "folk tales" are the most popular and easily understood by the general public; however, the problem is that all materials used as artistic themes cannot be unconditionally taken out and must be selected. The criteria for selection. On the one hand, it is necessary to consider the needs of society, and at the same time, to calculate the inevitable social reaction and its young fruits.

Undoubtedly, art inevitably has its utilitarian nature. In other words, the production of art inevitably has a common! Fixed purpose awareness. All artistic movements in the current stage should serve the Anti-Japanese War; this is an ironclad fact, but those folk tales that are used as film themes have no positive significance at all, and are purely a manifestation of feudal and decadent ideas. The effect they achieve is certainly not enough to move the public's enthusiasm for the motherland, but instead numbs the vast public. Therefore, such films are really undesirable.

However, according to the business situation in the table, almost all the films that are more popular are "folk tales," and the films that are considered to have a defensive consciousness are almost all unprofitable, which is often used as an excuse by the creators of poisonous films.

This is an unfortunate phenomenon that cannot be denied. Folk tales containing poison sell well, while films that are considered national defense films do not sell well. This is a fact, but it cannot be used to deny the existence of national defense films (To be continued)

### New Era and New Endeavors

— Zhang Qun

After a year and a half of the Anti-Japanese War, we have entered a new year, a new year in terms of time. It only makes us feel more deeply. However, if the plan for the year lies in the spring, at the beginning of a new year, we should also spur ourselves on to make new endeavors.

At the turn of the old and new years, whether in terms of the war situation, domestic affairs, or diplomacy, we are in a period of transition. We should further recognize the characteristics of this transition period in order to complete our tasks.

Generally speaking, during this year and a half, our losses and sacrifices, our shortcomings and weaknesses, are infinite. Therefore, our heartache and our shame are infinite. However, in this year and a half, we have also made progress and achieved success. Even if we have losses and shortcomings, some of the reasons did not arise today. However, in the process of the Anti-Japanese War, whether in military affairs, domestic affairs, or diplomacy, there are obvious signs of progress. Although we will never be complacent about this progress, and although our progress is not enough to keep up with our needs, we have firm confidence in the bright future of our motherland. At first, the invaders wanted to subdue us without fighting, and later they wanted to "resolve the war quickly." They tried to destroy our battlements and extinguish our will to fight. After spending a lot of effort, they finally realized after the fall of Wuhan that they could not make us kneel; after the fall of Guangzhou, they tried to seal us off; they even tried to shake us with all kinds of conspiracies and sinister schemes, intimidating us with the most brutal methods. Then, the enemy's conspiracy completely failed. Today, it is not China but Japan that is in fear and anxiety. Today, it is not us but the enemy that is disappointed and at a loss. Although we are covered in blood, we stand firm and fight like iron men. The enemy is not only disappointed in our growing strength in battle, but also amazed at our growing courage. We are strengthening our own strength in struggle, we are fighting in bloody battles, and we are reborn in bloody battles. We have infinite sorrow, and we also have infinite grandeur. This great and solemn spirit is the life of the Chinese nation, and undoubtedly, this great and solemn spectacle relies on the efforts of the entire army and people, and even more on the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang.

Currently, in military terms, we are in a period of transition. In the first stage of the war, in the past year and a half, the enemy occupied our transportation lines and strongholds with superior equipment. We have suffered countless losses, but we have also succeeded in consuming the enemy's strength. Our equipment, technology, morale, and military spirit have also improved through this bloody forging. In the future, the war will mainly be mobile warfare. Although the war in this period may not necessarily be as tense as in the past, the scope will definitely be expanded. The entire country will be a battlefield for the enemy to hold on to, but merely holding on is not our goal. We must accelerate the organization of our new national strength and new weapons, so that we can turn defense into offense in the second stage and repel the invaders with equal and superior fighting power. In this stalemate, we must strengthen resistance in the front while turning the enemy's rear into a battlefield. Furthermore, we must strengthen the cause of military construction and production in our rear. The greater our efforts, the shorter this stalemate will be, and the sooner we will turn defeat into victory.

In terms of domestic affairs, the consolidation and enrichment of national unity over the past year and a half is undoubtedly our greatest political success since the founding of the Republic of China. We must not only resist Japan to the end but also achieve complete unity. However, the biggest problem in the future is to unleash the power of unity and unleash the function of unity. How can we unleash the power and function of unity? This requires everyone to abide by the law. Everyone abiding by the law means that everyone is responsible and everyone is dedicated to public service. What was called discipline in ancient times is what is called the rule of law today. In the year and a half since then, we have not only achieved national unity, but the authority of national law has also increased. However, they have not yet implemented the spirit of abiding by the law. Dereliction of duty, corruption, extravagance, and perfunctory behavior are all caused by not abiding by the law. Key national policies such as military service have not been fully implemented, and even frugality cannot be practiced, also due to the failure to implement laws and regulations. We are already in the Anti-Japanese War and are now building the country on a large scale. In the future, we must have everyone abide by the law, establish the spirit of a modern country, and the spirit of the rule of law. Only in this way can we quickly complete the military service production plan and establish the strength of a modern country. The recent crackdown on the pleasures of civil servants can be said to be the beginning of strict law enforcement. In addition, in order to adapt to the needs of total war, the issues of politics and mass organizations in the occupied cities are of course also the goals of current efforts.

In terms of diplomacy, although there have been no major changes in the international arena in the past year and a half, it is indeed a period of brewing. In this brewing period, we have had many successes. First, the recognition and sympathy of friendly countries in Europe and the United States for China has increased day by day; second, Japan has become increasingly isolated. The successive progress of the resolutions of the League of Nations on China illustrates the former, and the active expansion of the military by Britain and the United States and the gradual decline of Japan's foreign trade illustrate the latter. Because of these two reasons, the two democratic countries on both sides of the Pacific, Britain and the United States, have also achieved unprecedented rapprochement. Today, as Japan's strength is increasingly depleted and China's unity and strength are increasingly strengthened, the international situation will inevitably improve day by day. The recent establishment of British and American loans is only the beginning of friendly countries' concrete assistance to China, and assisting China may also be a prelude to sanctioning Japan. Japan's recent statement on the Nine-Power Treaty is far less blunt than originally advertised, and it has already felt the pressure of international coercion. All countries except Japan regard China as a friendly country. China has always cherished the friendship of all friendly countries in times of adversity; we believe that the more unified and stronger we are, the more we will receive deeper assistance from friendly countries, because all friendly countries will definitely increasingly recognize that assisting China is assisting themselves.

The war situation and the future of China are bound to be bright, but the early realization of this light depends on the joint efforts of all sectors of society. We especially must not forget that as we progress and the international situation improves, the enemy will still go crazy before its "doom" arrives. Recently, Konoe declared that he would continue his aggression. Naturally, we can know even if he does not say it. Our only answer is to continue to resist and strengthen resistance. We are optimistic about the future of the nation, but we must not slacken and solemnly strive at all times. All efforts today should be adapted to the current military needs, that is, to resist the enemy in an all-round way while quickly enriching and building our inner strength to prepare for an all-round counter-attack. We need everyone to be frugal, abide by the law, and dedicate themselves to public service, and everyone must have this great and solemn confidence, so that we can continue to celebrate the victory of the Anti-Japanese War at the same time next year.

### Developing the Interior

— Wen

In the past, our important construction projects naturally tended to concentrate along the coast and railway lines. The government and investors generally had not given enough attention to the important interior regions. Since the War of Resistance, the importance of inland resources and the necessity of their utilization have been recognized by the entire nation. The calls for developing the Southwest and Northwest are now echoing throughout the country, indicating a shift in the nation's perspective. The interior, which was previously not given much attention, has now become the target of both the government and the public. This is a matter for celebration.

Our interior is very rich in resources. If all sectors can cooperate and work hard to develop these resources, it can truly serve as the foundation for our War of Resistance and national reconstruction. Take Sichuan Province as an example: the area between the Min River and the Tuo River is a very obvious economic zone. In this area, agricultural products are very developed, and major industries such as coal, salt, silk, paper, and sugar already have a considerable foundation. If electricity can be developed, the abundant resources in this region can be used to develop other industries as well. Another example is the Jialing River basin, centered around Chongqing, which was once the industrial and commercial center of Sichuan Province. In terms of industry, there are factories for dyeing and weaving, leather, glass and porcelain, matches, flour, and soap. In terms of mining, coal mines such as Jianghe, Tianfu, and Suichuan all have some production capacity. Exported goods such as tung oil, pigs, silk, sheepskin, medicinal materials, summer cloth, and tobacco leaves all exceed one million yuan annually. Since the War of Resistance, more than a hundred factories have moved from the coastal ports and railway lines. Therefore, this region will definitely become an industrial center in the future. Not only can light industry be developed here, but heavy industry can also establish a foundation here, because there are iron and oil reserves near Chongqing. In addition to these two regions, Sichuan also has the eastern Sichuan region centered around Wanxian. We all know that China's recent export trade is dominated by tung oil, and Sichuan's tung oil ranks first in the country in terms of both production and quality. Wanxian is the largest tung oil market in Sichuan Province. The importance of this region in international trade can be seen from this. Outside of Sichuan, there is gold in Xikang and Qinghai, mercury and coal mines in Guizhou, old tin mines in Yunnan, as well as coal, copper, lead, silver and other mines near the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Yunnan-Guizhou Railway. There are also tin and other domestic products in Guangxi, cotton and coal in Shaanxi, and wool, leather, and medicinal materials in the Gansu-Qinghai area, all waiting for us to develop. Some of these resources can establish the foundation of our national defense industry, some can serve as raw materials for people's livelihood industries, and some can be transported overseas to exchange for military equipment and production tools for the War of Resistance. These are all areas that should be worked on during the process of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction.

Now that we have understood the importance of developing the interior and seen clearly that there are many resources in the interior that urgently need to be developed, we can proceed to discuss the methods of developing the interior. There is a misunderstanding in society that developing the interior is solely the government's job. Of course, the government cannot shirk its responsibility for such a major event and should undertake the part that it can do. However, if it is said that the government is already promoting this work, and others can simply stand by and watch, that is the biggest misunderstanding. The government's job is to promote and lead the nation's manpower and financial resources to work hard to develop the interior under a certain policy. Under this unified management, the actual effort must rely on the courage and dedication of all sectors. In this kind of joint effort, government agencies also undertake some economic undertakings, but the intention is to create wealth for the country, not to compete with the people. Therefore, the undertakings are all within the scope of the following principles: (1) those urgently needed for national defense and should be specially managed; (2) those that need to be planned or controlled in a unified manner; (3) those that are large in scale and difficult to equip, and cannot be undertaken by ordinary financial resources; (4) those that are urgently needed for national defense and people's livelihood, and the profits and losses are not significant; (5) those that supply power or fuel for national industry. The undertakings run by the government must meet the above standards and are not monopolized. If the people are willing to invest in the undertakings run by the government, they can also negotiate ways to jointly run or link up with them. Except for special reasons, the government does not prohibit or hinder the people from running similar undertakings because it has run certain undertakings. Even if the laws stipulate that they are state-owned, the government can also entrust the people to operate them through joint ventures or leasing. For example, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently announced fifteen articles of the "Regulations on the Management of State-Owned Mining Areas," which is to give the people the opportunity to exploit state-owned mining areas as stipulated by law. The greatest need now is production, and massive production, for the use of the front, the rear, and for export. If the scope of state-owned enterprises is now defined too broadly, and at the same time there is no power to operate the undertakings stipulated within this scope, then the domestic productive forces will be restrained and unable to exert their power. Therefore, on the one hand, we are seriously reorganizing state-owned enterprises in order to create the scale of the enterprise, and at the same time, we also attach great importance to private enterprises, believing that the foundation of the national economy must be seriously developed.

The government has always been sincerely supporting and assisting private enterprises. In order to increase the speed of developing the interior, it is prepared to actively proceed in the following three aspects to enable private enterprises to develop more fully: First, the contact of work. In the past, private enterprises were all acting independently, without any organization. Now the government intends to make all industries organize trade associations in accordance with the newly-established laws and regulations, and also to establish links between industries. For example, the machinery needed by the chemical industry can be handed over to the machinery industry to manufacture, and the steel needed by the machinery industry is being assisted in supplying. In this way, information is exchanged, supply and demand are met, and an organic whole is formed, which can achieve twice the result with half the effort and increase efficiency. The government should take on this work of contact organization. The second is the assistance of funds. Private enterprises often stop halfway due to lack of capital? Now, during the War of Resistance, if factories move from the coast and along the rivers to the interior, all matters such as transportation, factory construction, and material purchase require a large amount of funds. Mining factories in the rear also need to increase capital to expand production and improve equipment. The government will suddenly need to help them borrow loans from banks at low interest rates. On the one hand, the government will directly allocate funds. The total of the two has reached more than 10 million yuan in the past year, and we will continue to assist them according to the original plan. The third is the provisions for incentives. The "Special Industrial Interest Protection and Subsidy Regulations" amended in June of the 27th year stipulate six types of industries that should be subsidized and protected by the government. The scope is inevitably excessive, and the methods of incentives are limited to interest protection and subsidies, which also fail to fully incentivize matters. The recently passed "Temporary Regulations on Awards and Assistance for Industry and Mining in Extraordinary Times" have added a type to the award and punishment methods. In addition to interest protection and subsidies, there are also tax reductions, convenient transportation, and exemption from land rent. As for the industries that should be rewarded, the scope is also planned to be expanded. All (1) those that are necessary for national defense and people's livelihood and should be held urgently, (2) those that develop inland bulk production or make the quality of existing bulk production more refined, (3) those that can be exported abroad to increase foreign trade, and (4) those that use domestic raw materials to imitate foreign products to reduce trade leaks are all examples of incentives.

The government's overall planning and joint promotion of economic undertakings, proceeding in this way, can be called management and can also be called control. Its policy takes the interests of the entire public as the highest premise, and it will do its best to lay the foundation for recovery. Everyone should also understand that the interests of the country are also the true interests of the general public, and only by working seriously in the same direction, regardless of the government or the public, can we achieve this extremely important goal. Therefore, a special explanation is given, hoping that everyone will uphold the responsibility of everyone and complete the great mission.

### Hopes for the Industry on the New Year's Day of the 28th Year of the Republic of China

— Sa Kongliao

Returning from Xinjiang, it happened that the Hong Kong Shen Bao was about to publish a special New Year's issue, urging me to write an article to join in the fun. This time, returning to Hong Kong, although I can say that my shoulders are relaxed and I no longer have as many responsibilities as in the past, I am still very busy because I have decided to end all matters here and return to the mainland by car. However, the Hong Kong Shen Bao asked me for an article, and I felt that I should not be lazy, because the Shen Bao is the oldest newspaper in Chinese history. As someone who has decided to dedicate my life to journalism, I should not give up any opportunity to contribute to this oldest newspaper. Furthermore, the Shanghai Shen Bao was discontinued under the same circumstances as the Shanghai Li Bao, which gave me an even stronger feeling that there was still a relationship between us of weathering the storm together. Therefore, even in my busy schedule, I still want to write a few words for it.

I have said before that I intend to dedicate my life to journalism, so the issue I want to discuss on New Year's Day of the 28th year of the Republic of China is still about journalism.

It has been a full year since I left Shanghai until now. This year is a year of great changes in all aspects of China. The Chinese journalism industry, of course, cannot be an exception. Because of the fall of Hankou and Guangzhou, almost all of China's national newspapers have become local. Although the newspapers in Hong Kong and Chongqing are now in an unprecedented crowded state, due to the difficulty of transportation, each newspaper can only be sold near Hong Kong and Chongqing. Therefore, the daily spiritual food of the people of Hong Kong and Chongqing—the newspaper—is excessive in terms of quantity. However, people all over the country, especially those in areas that are nominally occupied but not actually occupied, or those near the occupied areas, are feeling a general famine of daily spiritual food. This time, on my 20,000-mile trip from Hong Kong to Xinjiang and back, what moved me the most was this phenomenon.

Not to mention the occupied areas, even in smaller cities in the interior, the situation of the newspaper is simply beyond imagination. What is especially pitiful is that the newspaper is extremely backward, and some places do not even have it. This most important propaganda tool is so unsound among the people, how can we talk about true national mobilization?

So if someone wants to ask what is the first work we should do in the 28th year of the Republic of China? Standing in my own position, I answer that the first work we should do is to make newspapers visible to the poor villages and remote areas throughout the country, whether they are occupied or not. Because only by doing this can our strength in the War of Resistance truly "only increase and not weaken."

In the past year, I only felt that one thing in the journalism industry was the most meaningful, and that was the recent publication of the North China edition of the Xinhua Daily in the occupied areas. I believe that we who have dedicated ourselves to journalism are far better off going to small villages and towns in poor rural areas to run mimeographed newspapers or wall newspapers, and working with our conscience to awaken the people, than to be squeezed in the two places involved and eating rice as tools for boring politicians. Meaningful.

So on this New Year's Day, I want to ask every colleague in the journalism industry to think about what they are doing now, living that life of night and day, and whether their work in the country today, which is on the verge of danger, will be of any benefit to the country. If, after thinking about this, you feel that you were completely wrong in the past, then I hope that everyone will change the direction of their work from today.

The so-called new direction of work, of course, is to go to small villages and small cities to shoulder the responsibility of reporting and propaganda. However, everyone must say that this goal cannot be reached by bare hands alone. Insufficient material conditions and the illiteracy of the people in rural areas are two major difficulties that are extremely difficult to overcome. Therefore, even if there are people who want to implement what I said, the result will only be a fantasy for a while and retreat in the face of difficulties.

This statement is incorrect. I have thought a lot about how to realize the work of going deep into the people to shoulder the responsibility of reporting and propaganda during the 20,000-mile journey. Up to now. My conclusion is:

In order to simplify the tools used, and in order for illiterate people to easily accept it, if we want to run newspapers in rural areas, we can only run newspapers in Romanized characters.

In terms of tools, the simplest thing is just a mimeograph machine and a radio. A better set of equipment is a radio, plus a few sets of English type and a foot-operated press. enough.

As for the method of illiterate people accepting it, it is to go to a place and first find some young people to teach them Romanized characters. Then publish the newspaper. Then they can quickly realize that they don't need to use much effort. After a long time, they will no longer be illiterate. Even can read the newspaper. At that time, the price does not need to change to worry about whether your work is successful. I guarantee that your newspaper will definitely have a very large development in a short period of time.

In Shanghai, the "Mass Newspaper" sponsored by the New Writing Research Association has achieved excellent results, which is a good example for us.

If many of the colleagues in the journalism industry can feel that my construction is still reasonable.

And if everyone organizes together and sets up a "center" in a larger city, and then everyone disperses to various villages and towns, exchanging work experience through this "center," I believe that in this work, everyone will not only contribute to the country, but also gain much more useful experience than just struggling to eat in Hong Kong and Chongqing.

I hope that on this New Year's Day, through the first newspaper in China—Shen Bao—I can introduce my ideals to everyone, and I hope that everyone will create a new era for Chinese journalism!

### From Wang Zhaoming's Change of Heart to the Political Strategy, Military Strategy, and Tactics of Our Second Phase of the War of Resistance

— Chen Xiaoxian

Wang Zhaoming's absurd document of accepting the conditions for national subjugation and negotiating peace with Japan was publicly disclosed on the evening of December 30th! The reporter had heard about this set of tricks a long time ago, but I was unwilling to use the heart of a gentleman to suspect the heart of a villain, so I kept silent for the time being.

In Wang Zhaoming's plan: (1) secretly leave Chongqing, (2) wait until he reaches a safe zone far away, and the × Prime Minister Konoe's statement is published, (3) Zhaoming issues a declaration in response to Konoe's statement, (4)...(5)...(6).... The reporter believes that the steps (4), (5), and (6) have not yet been revealed, and the weaving is too broad, and I am afraid of being caught in the conspiracy to provoke discord, so I am unwilling to be a messenger of rumors and put it in the newspaper. Now Zhaoming has shamelessly disregarded everything and revealed his true colors. Seeing him performing scene by scene, his impact on the front line of the War of Resistance will be of concern to people at home and abroad. The reporter is responsible for answering: "No impact at all." The reason has been announced three days before the publication of Zhaoming's absurd proposal, saying: "If you bow down to the enemy," then you will lose all your personality! It is tantamount to cutting yourself off from the country, cutting yourself off from the people. Everyone will point their fingers at you. No matter what excuses or rumors you make, you cannot justify yourself. What kind of appeal can you have! This kind of argument and belief is applicable to everyone. The higher you climb, the harder you fall. If you know this, then you will know that from now on, the camp of the War of Resistance has progressed from chaos to clarity. Following this, the date of the final victory is not far away! (Published in the 221st issue of the Observatory Semi-Weekly Review) However, the reporter has a frank heart and cannot help but speak. Since Zhaoming's change of heart, it has increasingly inspired the × country's warlords to deepen their unscrupulous military ambitions. The Chinese and Japanese people must shed at least 10 million more people's blood. Not only the vast Chinese people. ×××××××××××××××××××××××· Even Japanese subjects. The tragic world of widows and orphans will not stop until the continuous war is over. ×××××××××××× Here is the process. When the × military and political powers took Guangzhou and Wuhan, and took the step of sealing off the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, Britain and the United States took active action, starting with credit bags and providing parallel assistance to China to continue the War of Resistance. Under the principle of "using resources to judge victory and defeat" in modern times, the × country's continuous bloodshed is of no value. You don't need to ask the opinion of high-ranking political strategists and strategists. Even asking the dog-headed commander can give an affirmative answer. You shouldn't fight anymore, so the reporter hinted more than half a month ago that the × country was considering "which is more beneficial to continue the war or end the war?" I dare to see its lungs and liver. × The military's distress and annoyance have never been greater than this. The shelving of the Konoe statement and the suspension of the pseudo-federal organization movement are all signs of the × country abandoning the war and seeking peace. The military headquarters also intends to withdraw troops from the country on January 16th under the conditions of not recognizing our government's declaration and return the invaded land, but because this matter is too important, even the stubborn Itagaki did not dare to take obvious actions. Only the most powerful pro-war and the most radical elements who wanted to destroy China completely, such as Tada, Vice Minister of the General Staff Headquarters, and Tojo, Vice Minister of the Army, were transferred out of the heart of the military headquarters and replaced by the moderate factions of Nakasui and Yamawaki. The two war zones of Henan and Northwest have entered a state of truce invisibly because of this. Japan's eagerness to seek peace has never been greater than it is now since the September 18th Incident. Gu, because our highest leader insisted on resisting to the end, and anyone who dared to negotiate without Japan first withdrawing its troops from the country to show sincerity would be killed without mercy, the × party was unable to find a way to enter. However, if we hold on for a period of time, × will decline again and know that it will withdraw its troops. In addition, the will of the × party's military headquarters is not uniform, and the special agents in China have been in a state of general mobilization from the beginning. Each seeks a way, and there are many people around Zhaoming who are familiar with Japan. How to thread the needle in this, I am afraid that God does not know and ghosts do not know. We dare not speculate, but we can do it so that Zhaoming quietly leaves Chongqing and arrives safely in Hanoi. At that moment, the Konoe statement was released, and after the Konoe statement was released, Zhaoming used the form of a suggested article to respond in essence with a declaration. The picture is poor and the dagger is revealed, and it is abandoned by the whole country. Moreover, the performance of the next scene and scene may not be realized as expected. From a distance, it has no impact on the overall situation of the War of Resistance or can help consolidate the anti-war camp for Gan and Qing swingers, but from a recent perspective, it is heartbreaking. The sudden turn of events in the Northwest battlefield from static to dynamic must be blamed on Zhaoming.

Kita, the head of the special service agency in North China, recently sent a secret telegram to the military headquarters, saying: This place is launching a major plan to cut off the international transportation line between China and the Soviet Union and to attack northern Shaanxi and expand the occupied territory of Manchuria and Mongolia. We must never show weakness and retreat halfway or make compromises to save our center. Why did Kita say this? Isn't it because of Zhaoming's actions that he has increasingly inspired the wild ambition to go all out to the end, advance into the northwest, carry out a full-scale invasion, and expand the pseudo-organization? I said: Since Zhaoming's change of heart has increasingly inspired the × country's warlords to deepen their unscrupulous military ambitions, the Chinese and Japanese people must shed at least 10 million more people's blood.

I once read a Song poem: "⺎ Shu was defeated by Yu Zhuxian, and abandoned Bian to leave. A scholar knocked on the horse and said: Crown Prince, don't go, Yue Shaobao is about to retreat - ⺎ Shu said: Yue Shaobao broke my 100,000 troops with five hundred riders, and the capital city has been waiting for it day and night. Servants can defend, Ya Sheng said: Since ancient times, there has never been a powerful minister inside and a great general who can make achievements outside. Yue Shaobao will not be spared, let alone succeed - 兀 Shu realized, so he stayed and did not leave."

When Jin complained that the war was lost and had no confidence in winning peace, if it were not for one word, 兀 Shu would have left, not only would the Song Dynasty have been completely destroyed, but the living beings would also have been spared from painting their hearts. It is said that the crime of a scholar is greater than that of Qin Xiang. Who said no!

Now our country is fighting for survival, for equality and freedom, for justice and humanity, which is completely different from the war for one surname and one person in the past. Hundreds of millions of soldiers and 470 million people are firmly supporting our highest leader and resisting to the end. It is by no means possible to shake it with × plans and treacherous media. After this, the internal traitors can be gradually eradicated. The health office quoted the historical example of "Since ancient times, there has never been a powerful minister inside and a great general who can make achievements outside." It is even more inappropriate to appear today. Breaking the rear anti-war camp will only be strengthened, and unity will only be consolidated. Seeing that we attach importance to the military thought of "subduing the enemy without fighting" in political strategy and military strategy, but from the beginning, we did not have the extravagant hope of obtaining a price without bloodshed. After entering the second phase of the war, the international situation improved, and international assistance was also active, which is no different from the help of the world. Attacking the rebellions of the great world belongs to the one who is slightly. The future combat areas belong to mountainous areas, where ×'s heavy weapons cannot be used, and the doctrine of firepower is even more unworkable. On the contrary, the light weapons used by our army can not only be self-made and self-sufficient. The savings of medicine are even greater than before, and there are more opportunities for close combat than in the past, with mourning soldiers fighting a long-term war of war. This is the best condition for strategy two. The central breakthrough and flanking outflanking tactics of the × army were applied to the first phase of the war zone, or there was one day of length. After entering the northwest and southwest regions, the central breakthrough was adopted, and the mountains and ridges were heavy and resented, and the river crossings were blocked. The flanking outflanking must pass through thousands of deserted lands. Not only is it difficult to carry food and ammunition, but even the people and horses feel helpless to drink water. On the contrary, the people's organization and people's armed forces in this area have achieved special results. Everyone is a soldier, and every step is a camp. If the front strikes, the back responds, and if the east gallops, the west strikes. It can be automatic and can be preemptive. This belongs to tactic three.

All of these key points, ask × famous strategists, can not fail to recognize the advantages of our army, and will never affect the concentration of central forces due to the changes of Zhaoming's group. The improvement of the international situation and the tenacity of mountain warfare have led to the achievement of victory and harmony. Moreover, after Zhaoming left Chongqing, there was no shock overseas for him to use the false face of destiny, and he was treated with respect, but the front and the rear, the army and the government turned to think that the discovery was early, and the clarification could be expected, so no importance was given to it. After attending the memorial week on the 27th, our highest leader flew to the northwest to deploy military affairs. Although the Yellow River is frozen, and there are thousands of miles of bad connections between Jin and Shaanxi, it is possible to cross it everywhere. However, since the river crossing is steep and impossible to climb, it is difficult to climb the sky. The riverbank is gentle and easy to enter and exit to the south of the river crossing, but I have a large army densely deployed, firing artillery across the river to prevent × from advancing, and to appease the rear forces for liaison. There are only two railways that can be used: Zhengtai and Tongdi. The Daoqing Railway, which is the intersection point of Xinxiang, ends at Qinghua Town. Beyond this, it is a highway. The transportation capacity is not superior. This is to attack northern Shaanxi based in Shanxi. and criticize its difficulty. × attacked Shaanxi, not × Dao Zhengzhou, and advanced westward along the Longhai Zheng Road, which shows that its military strength is no longer sufficient for deployment. Now, Kita even exaggeratedly cuts off the international traffic line between China and the Soviet Union and the vast occupied area of Manchuria and Mongolia, and launches a joint attack on northern Shaanxi. His lack of importance is no different from Zhaoming's change of heart. The reporter is unwilling to write about it again. Hong Kong, December 31

Shen Bao New Year Special Issue

### Resistance Against Japan and the Future of Our Party

— Chiang Kai-shek

This article is an important part of President Chiang's speech at the Kuomintang Provisional National Congress, which has not yet been published and is therefore specially published here.

This Sino-Japanese War is an unavoidable war in the process of national revolution. It is also the inevitable result of the absolute conflict between Japan's deliberate policy of destroying China and the revolutionary countermeasure of our party to save China. This revolutionary policy of our party was established by our late Premier. To explain our party's established revolutionary countermeasure, we must first understand the consistent and inherited continental policy of Japanese imperialists to invade China. Since the Meiji era, Japan has had a consistent continental invasion plan. In the past, during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, it invaded and occupied our Taiwan and Ryukyu Islands. After the Russo-Japanese War, it annexed Korea and seized our Lushun and Dalian, completing the initial stage of its continental policy. It used Taiwan as a base for southward advance, from which it invaded our South China and East China, and used Korea and Lushun-Dalian as its base for northward advance, from which it attacked our Manchuria and North China. It wanted to use the posture of a venomous snake; to encircle and destroy China from both land and sea, fulfilling its ambition of dominating East Asia. We can fully understand this ambition from Tanaka's memorial on the positive policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia, as well as the recent Japanese invasion of North China, East China, and South China. When our Premier was alive, he had already seen through Japan's ambition and the dangerous position of China. He established a revolutionary countermeasure for our party, which was to "restore Korea and consolidate China." Because Korea was originally our vassal state, and Taiwan is our territory. Geographically speaking, they are all lifelines related to the safety and survival of China. If China wants to pursue true national defense and maintain lasting peace in East Asia, it must not allow Korea and Taiwan to be controlled by Japanese imperialism. For thousands of years, China has been the leading country in East Asia. Protecting the East Asian nations and establishing peace in East Asia is an unavoidable responsibility for China. In order to fulfill our mission of national revolution and curb the ambitions of countries that disrupt East Asia, we must target the Japanese aggressive conspiracy and take the liberation of the people of Korea and Taiwan as our duty. This is what our Premier often told our comrades during his lifetime.

Since Japan has established a traditional policy of invading China, and we, the Chinese people, adhering to the Premier's will and determined to save China, confront each other tit-for-tat with absolute conflict. Therefore, unless Japan abandons its ambition of invasion and withdraws its invading forces, the Sino-Japanese War is unavoidable. Moreover, from China's perspective, we can either not seek our country's independence and the survival of our nation, or, if we want to implement the Premier's Three People's Principles and fulfill our party's mission of saving the country, so that the five thousand years of long-standing glorious history and culture inherited from our ancestors can continue to flourish, and so that our vast people and resource-rich great country can be revived and strengthened, we must eliminate Japan's ambition of invasion and remove Japan's forces of aggression in order to achieve our revolutionary goals.

In order to implement its continental invasion policy, Japan has been trying every possible means for decades to eliminate our Kuomintang in order to achieve its goal of destroying our Chinese nation. In order to implement this aggressive policy, it has exhausted various conspiracies and poisonous schemes, which is truly painstaking and cannot be described in a few words. The first conspiracy it used was partitioning. In 1927, when our party's army was marching and fighting to Nanjing, it used the Nanjing Incident as an excuse to incite the great powers in an attempt to partition China. The idea of partitioning originally arose from the corruption of China's internal affairs, so they forced the Qing government to sign treaties and demarcate the spheres of influence of various countries. Later, after the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the idea of partitioning disappeared invisibly. When the Nanjing Incident occurred in 1927, Japan suddenly proposed the idea of re-partitioning. Why did it propose this? It knew that although Japan could not seize the entire interest of China at this time, it could certainly occupy more advantages through partitioning. Therefore, at that time, it tried its best to induce the great powers to jointly intervene and implement the partition of China. After this proposal was put forward, Britain remained noncommittal, waiting for Britain's attitude to determine the matter. At that time, the United States, in order to uphold its traditional policy of open door and equal opportunity, opposed Japan's proposal, and the plan to partition was not successful. This is a piece of Japanese aggression history against China eleven years ago.

Knowing that its plan to partition China had no possibility of realization, Japan changed its approach and wanted to monopolize it. We can fully understand this ambition of monopolizing by simply looking at the fact that since the September 18th Incident, while intensifying its aggression, it has declared that all Sino-Japanese issues refuse any third-party intervention. The most favorable method for it to implement monopoly in order to achieve the complete destruction of China is to use a gradual plan, gradually invading our territory and dividing our country. When the second phase of our revolutionary army's Northern Expedition began, it prevented the revolutionary army from advancing north of the Yellow River on the one hand, and conspired to establish a puppet government in North China on the other. The puppet organizations it has now established in North China can be said to have been planned as early as 1927 and 1928. Because it did not allow our revolutionary army to go north, it dispatched troops to Shandong in 1928 when the revolutionary army reached Jinan, using violence to obstruct it and creating the Jinan Incident. In their minds, they always believed that the Yangtze River and the south of the Yangtze River were the spheres of influence of Britain and other countries, and that the north of the Yellow River must be controlled by Japan. I remember when I went to Japan in 1927, Tanaka Giichi openly expressed to me, he said: "Why must you lead troops to the Northern Expedition? Can't you establish a government in Nanjing?"

This meant instructing me not to let the revolutionary army go north of the Yellow River, but only to stay in the south of the Yellow River. I replied, "The revolutionary momentum cannot be stopped, China must be unified. Within China, there must not be two governments, otherwise China will be unstable and East Asia will not be stable." But he later still sent troops to obstruct my Northern Expedition, occupied my Jinan, and used this to intimidate me, thinking that I would not dare to continue to advance. He never expected that our revolutionary army would still cross the Yellow River and push towards Beiping when the Japanese army occupied Jinan, and finally overcome Pingjin and complete the Northern Expedition. Therefore, his poisonous plan to divide North China suffered a great blow at this time. Since our revolutionary army reached Beiping, the three northeastern provinces automatically changed their flags and responded to the revolution, so that the whole country of China was unified under the National Government of our party. This matter was even more unexpected by Japan. Originally, after the Russo-Japanese War, Japan regarded China's Manchuria, especially the three northeastern provinces, as its forbidden territory, and was determined to erode it, having already shown signs of becoming the master. When the revolutionary army arrived in Pingjin, it thought that the revolutionary momentum of our party would stop here and would not be able to advance to the Northeast. At the same time, in order to take the lead in preventing this from happening, it launched the bombing incident in Huanggutun on the one hand, and sent ruffians to disrupt the government organs in Changdi on the other, in order to show intimidation. Its actual purpose was to establish another government in the three northeastern provinces, to make the Northeast break away from the National Government and become independent, and to fundamentally prevent our revolutionary forces from developing into the northeastern provinces. But unexpectedly, the authorities of the three northeastern provinces at that time automatically requested to be unified under the central government, so the work of the National Government to unify the country was able to proceed smoothly and successfully, giving his policy of gradual encroachment on China a great blow!

His partitioning failed, and his gradual encroachment failed, but his ambition to invade China turned more and more rapidly. After Tanaka's death, the so-called young soldiers launched their wild ambitions. After Tanaka died, the Japanese warlords became leaderless, just like wild horses without reins. At the time of the September 18th Incident, they disregarded everything, raised troops and rebelled, invaded and occupied our Northeast, causing a major incident that shocked the world, and causing a great threat to peace in East Asia and even world peace.

Since the September 18th Incident, for the past six or seven years, Japan's invasion of China has truly been inching forward without end. It has not only invaded and occupied our Northeast, but also disturbed our Guannei, invaded Jidong, disturbed Tianjin, seized Chaharbei in the Great Wall Campaign, and threatened our capital in the Battle of Shanghai, gradually encroaching westward, and deliberately dividing us, wanting to follow the steps of gradual encroachment to achieve the goal of completely annexing China. Under this situation, if we want to survive and save the country, we have no choice but to fight to the death with the forces of the whole nation. We must all know that if this war is unavoidable, then the earlier it starts, the smaller the disaster that China will suffer from Japanese aggression; if it starts later, the greater the disaster we will suffer. Therefore, when the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred last July, we recognized that peace between China and Japan was hopeless, and that our country and nation had reached the final moment of life and death. At this moment, we can only resolutely launch a comprehensive and long-term war of resistance to break the poisonous plan of gradual encroachment and division. But after we implemented the national war of resistance, Japanese militarists knew that the plan of swallowing was impossible, so they simply mobilized a large number of naval, land, and air forces to carry out armed aggression and realize their dream of swallowing China whole.

After launching the Lugou Bridge Incident, they gathered a large number of naval, land, and air forces to occupy Pingjin and invade Shanghai, with a mighty force, not hesitating to go to war. In fact, their intention was still consistent in using their policy since the past twenty-four years, wanting to carry out intimidation in order to achieve the goal of subduing us without a fight. They did not know that modern China is no longer the China of Yuan Shikai's era twenty years ago. They did not expect that the Premier's great beliefs had taken root in the hearts of the people, and that our party's revolutionary forces had been established throughout the country. Especially, they only saw that our national defense preparations had not been completed, and that the power of material economy had not been fully developed. Therefore, when they mobilized armed aggression, they only calculated that China's military equipment was no match for them, but they did not calculate our vast land, abundant resources, and large population, all the inexhaustible potential, into the power of war. They did not calculate the revolutionary spirit of our Premier and revolutionary martyrs sacrificing and struggling, and the spirit of the Three People's Principles, into the power of war, and thought that with their superior military and material power, they could suppress China in one fell swoop. But they did not know that this Sino-Japanese War is not a common international war, but a revolutionary war of the Chinese nation to complete the national revolution and seek freedom and equality. In this revolutionary war, material and military power are only one of the conditions related to victory or defeat, and the main condition that determines the victory or defeat of war is still spirit—that is, revolutionary doctrine. As long as our faith in the doctrine does not waver, and the power of the doctrine is not eliminated, any violence cannot destroy us. What's more, we have five thousand years of long-standing glorious history and great and noble culture, we have four hundred and fifty million compatriots, and forty million square li of land. With our revolutionary spirit, using these superior conditions, eighteen months of resistance have been enough to awaken the crazy dreams of Japanese aggression. They not only cannot achieve the goal of subduing us without a fight, but they cannot even achieve the goal of quick battles and quick decisions even if they use all their strength. I believe that after the War of Resistance, not only will Japan not dare to invade us again, but the world will also have to change the standard for estimating the power of war. At least it can make peace more respected and guaranteed.

Although our War of Resistance against Japan has inevitably suffered setbacks in the early stages, we have all the necessary conditions for victory and the foundation for certain victory. As long as our party comrades lead the four hundred million compatriots with one heart and one mind, unite as one, and under the leadership of one doctrine and one government, work hard, struggle, and advance unremittingly, not only will one Japan not be able to do anything to us, but even three or four times the current power of Japan will not be able to defeat us. Our War of Resistance will surely be victorious, and the Chinese nation will surely be revived.

### Accomplishing Our Sacred Mission

— Ke

Time flies, and now it is the beginning of the 28th year of the Republic of China! What everyone remembers, of course, is the sacred war of resistance of the past one year and six months; what everyone pursues, of course, is the bright and splendid future ahead. We cannot think that everything in the past is necessarily satisfactory, but one thing can be said: the War of Resistance is always satisfactory! The War of Resistance is for the independence of the country, the liberation of the nation, and the freedom and equality of the four hundred and fifty million descendants of the Yellow Emperor. The important value of the War of Resistance itself will of course make anyone sing its praises, and "Resistance is revolution." Our inability to doubt resistance is the same as our inability to doubt revolution, and has the same meaning.

However, the War of Resistance is not for the sake of resistance for resistance's sake. Resistance is only a means, not an end. Our goal is to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People, because a new China based on the Three Principles of the People is international equality (nationalism), political equality (democracy), political equality (democracy), and economic equality (people's livelihood). The War of Resistance is to defeat the aggressive forces of Japanese imperialism, and then seek the full realization of nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood. Therefore, what everyone is pursuing is the bright and splendid future of a new China where "resistance will surely be victorious and nation-building will surely be successful"!

How to realize this future?

This is the task for all of us!

Since the goal is hanging in front of us, and the responsibility is resting on the shoulders of each of us, everyone's efforts from now on should pay attention to the following things:

First, we must have a strong conviction of national self-esteem and self-confidence. We do not deny that the Chinese nation already has some weaknesses, and has exposed many vices, but the long history and culture of more than five thousand years is something that no other country can catch up with; the Chinese people's habits of loving peace, valuing trustworthiness, and enduring diligence and frugality are also superior to any other nation; the Chinese people are not more foolish than Westerners, and the Chinese people's innate intelligence and talent are indeed superior, but because the level of education is not universal, and the various aspects of politics, economy, and society have not yet reached the level of modernization, many shortcomings are still present, which is also the reason why China is being invaded and oppressed by strong forces. However, invasion and oppression can be regarded as the only opportunity to alert us, teach us, and improve us! We must never shake our strong conviction of national self-esteem and self-confidence! If our own belief in our own country and nation is fundamentally shaken, then we are only declaring spiritual bankruptcy, declaring kneeling and surrender, and simply degrading ourselves to be captives of imperialism and slaves of the Japanese! This kind of person who has lost confidence is slag that should be eliminated in terms of the nation, and is the number one fool in the world in terms of the individual.

Second, we must have a thorough understanding of the current military and political situation and an optimistic attitude. Why are some people pessimistic about the current situation and doubt the future of the War of Resistance? Some even hope for compromise and peace? This is undoubtedly due to their unclear estimation and unclear observation of the future of military, political, and diplomatic affairs. Of course, we do not deny that the loss of territory and troops over the past year or so is a failure rather than a victory; but we must know that it is inevitable for a weak nation with everything lagging behind to resist imperialism. If we did not have a predetermined trend of failure, the Japanese imperialists would not have come to invade us in the first place! Therefore, what we are fighting for since the start of the War of Resistance is the final victory, not the gain or loss of one place or one city, and the advantages and disadvantages of quick battles and quick decisions. How to win the final victory? Chairman Chiang has already made it clear that it is a "protracted war," it is a "total war," and it is a "proactive war"; the current moment is the start of the unfolding of the total war, the protracted war, and the proactive war. What we are fighting for is how to wear down the enemy in this current stage? How to trap and starve the enemy to death? It must be after a certain period of time before a major counterattack can determine the final victory. Therefore, in terms of the current stage of strategy, there is no need to be pessimistic at all, and at the same time, there is only optimism. Militarily, everything is entering a favorable situation; politically, in addition to working hard to produce in order to balance exchange rates, we have recently obtained the support of British and American loans; diplomatically, the situation of the national attachment is actively improving, which is even more obvious to all. Looking at the enemy: the increase in anti-war sentiment among their general public, the replenishment of their troops has encountered fundamental problems; their finances are even more exhausted and are on the verge of collapse; as for the isolation and helplessness in diplomacy, which is about to suffer a major blow, their difficulties need no further discussion. Therefore, from any aspect, we are optimistic—we do have many places where we feel stretched, but in fact, the enemy has more places where they are stretched than we do. Why do we only value the enemy and despise ourselves! All wavering ideas and pessimistic emotions, everyone should thoroughly overcome them! Thouroughly eliminate them!

Third, we must have a spirit of self-encouragement, gritting our teeth to endure hardship, and a spirit of struggle. As mentioned earlier: what we are striving for is the "final victory," and everyone must know that the more "final" it is, the more difficulties it will go through, and the greater the suffering it will suffer. War is originally "unavoidable." What mankind seeks is peace, not war. The reason why we are inevitably on the path of resistance is originally to seek survival for the nation and to fight for independence for the country without hesitation. Under this meaning, as long as it is beneficial to the nation and the country, as long as the sacrifices we pay are sufficient to benefit the survival of the nation and the independence of the country, we have no choice but to desperately endure any hardships and difficulties—so we hope that all compatriots and comrades throughout the country, whether in the front or in the rear, whether it is better to contribute money or effort, must grit their teeth and endure hardship to the end; at the same time, we must use the spirit of "seeking life in death" to fight selflessly. Now some people, because they are living in a corner of the southwest, because they miss their hometowns that have been lost, because they feel the pressure of life and the difficulty of the situation, have developed the idea of compromise and surrender from their usual comfortable and pampered mood. This is a most shameful phenomenon. In fact, observing the many facts at present, it seems that apart from the former soldiers, have the people in the rear suffered any hardships? We only see a distorted prosperity, we only see pointless waste. Where is the strict control of countries like those during the European war—where is the national rationing of food and clothing like during the European war—China's current situation is indeed morbid, indeed needs to be corrected with effort, but on the other hand, it shows that China's vast territory and abundant resources, its great economic elasticity, are far beyond what Japanese imperialism can reach. As long as everyone endures hardship, as long as people understand the true meaning of life, can adjust their personal standards of living and desires, and at the same time contribute their strength and wealth to the country as much as possible, then, not to mention fighting the Japanese for three or five years, but even ten or eight years, or even a hundred years of war, China has the strength to sustain it—the problem lies in whether we can endure hardship and are willing to struggle.

Fourth, we must use the program of resistance and nation-building as the only goal of our hard work and struggle. The long-term war of resistance is originally an extremely arduous and outstanding task, and the reason why it is arduous and outstanding is not in the war of resistance itself, but especially in the simultaneous advancement of war of resistance and nation-building. The declaration of the Provisional National Congress of our party is the clearest explanation of this point—we should do our best to strive for the survival and prosperity of the country and the nation, and at the same time, according to the Three Principles of the People, continue to complete the political and economic construction, so that China can gain freedom and equality in the world. We also know that if our country now had a peaceful environment, it would be easier to complete this construction, but the aggression of Japanese imperialism is deepening, making peace hopeless. This war of resistance is inevitable and unavoidable in terms of the situation. We cannot hope to build in the midst of peace. We must make the war of resistance and the nation-building go hand in hand. Then, the responsibility of saving the country simultaneously falls on our shoulders. As for how to resist and build the nation? The Three Principles of the People are our highest guiding principles, and the program of resisting and building the nation is the practical direction for implementing our principles. What we need to examine now is whether these programs have been implemented? Or how many percent have they been implemented? What we need to strive for is how to develop the wartime nation-building work so that after the war stops, it will become the political and economic foundation for national revival. For example, wartime state-owned trade, industrial and mining adjustments, etc., will achieve the purpose of developing state capital and controlling private capital after the war; wartime participation system, military service system, etc., will achieve the purpose of democracy, local autonomy, and free conscription after the war, etc. In short, in the process of our struggle to resist and build the nation on this side, we must not leave our program at any time, and we must strive to realize the Three Principles of the People at all times.

According to the above points, first, we firmly believe in the self-esteem and self-confidence of our own nation, so that we have a "foundation"—second, we thoroughly understand the situation between the enemy and ourselves, and we feel at ease and justified, so that we "do not waver"—third, we are determined to sacrifice and struggle to the end, and we will fight a protracted war with the enemy, so that the "final victory" belongs to us—fourth, we work hard according to a certain direction and goal, so that we will not "collapse" during the war, and we can "revive" after the war—in this way, it is our bright and splendid future—the masses must catch up quickly to accomplish our sacred mission!

### Promoting and Expanding National Consciousness

— Wang Chonghui

Since the war of resistance began, the most prominent example of the unity and progress promoted in our country due to the aggression of powerful [Japanese] is the increase in national consciousness. Over the past year, [the Japanese] have been pushing their so-called continental policy, aiming to divide and eventually eliminate our nation by seizing our country's territory. Therefore, since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, both the government and the public in our country have deeply felt the invasion of the nation, the insecurity of our borders, and the surge of imperialism, and have been anxious about it. However, [the Japanese]' desire to implement their continental policy has led to different approaches over the decades due to different views on implementation steps among those in power. Some advocated deception, like Shidehara, while others favored forceful seizure, like Tanaka. However, despite different paths, they all lead to the same destination, ultimately being birds of a feather. It can be asserted that their ultimate goal is to annex our country, with no other intentions. Because of this, our country's efforts to improve internal affairs and strengthen national defense to resist foreign aggression have become a unified call. However, before the Lugouqiao (Marco Polo Bridge) Incident, this consciousness only reached a certain class, and the general public did not have a strong sense of it. The reason for this is that those who bear political responsibility and knowledgeable people in society or education have a clearer understanding of the situation, while the general public has not directly felt any impact. The only exception is the people in the four northeastern provinces who have already been oppressed by [the Japanese]. The people in other provinces did not feel it as deeply, and even those in the lower classes of knowledge were not moved. But now, things are very different from the past. During the eighteen months since [the Japanese] attacked our country, their atrocities and actions in every place they passed through have been countless, as seen in Chinese and foreign newspapers and detailed accounts in books. The barbaric and outrageous words of [Japanese] warlords and those in power, as well as their disregard for any country in the world, their tearing up of sacred treaties, and their actions to eliminate the rights and interests of third countries, have been seen repeatedly. As a result, not only do countries concerned with collective security have a deep understanding of the aggression of violent [Japanese] and their actions against the world, but also the general public in our country has clearly realized the urgent necessity of the whole nation uniting to resist foreign aggression and save the country. Therefore, there have been frequent reports of people in various places organizing forces to rise up and resist [the Japanese] invasion. Even in places without organization, it is common to see people using their strength to punish the enemy. Not only that, various parties, factions, groups, and aspects have shown their greatest determination and expressed their greatest support for resisting [the Japanese] and building the country under the leadership of the central government. From this perspective, the aggression of powerful [Japanese] against our country this time has not only failed to divide and annex our country but has also promoted the increase in national consciousness in our country.

However, we must not be satisfied with this. We have experienced that the national consciousness of our people has been significantly enhanced by the invasion of the powerful [Japanese]. Based on this increased state, we should make more efforts to further expand the methods of national understanding in order to resist [the Japanese] and complete the great mission of resisting [the Japanese] and building the country. At this critical moment of survival, the country and the people are like standing at a crossroads. One step forward means life, one step back means death. Without resistance, there can be no nation-building. Only resistance is nation-building. Without revival, there is destruction. Therefore, we must gather the strength of all parties, factions, groups, aspects, and classes of people in the country, expand national consciousness under the guidance of the highest leader, fight a life-and-death battle with [the Japanese], recover our lost territories, save our compatriots in the occupied areas, and expel [the Japanese] from our territory. Only then can we jointly witness the completion of the construction of a new China. On the occasion of the New Year, I would like to offer these words to all patriots, using them as a congratulatory message.

### Wishing the 28th Year of the Republic of China

— Zhang Yilin

"Try to look at the land today, whose world is it anyway!"

——Written for the Hong Kong Shen Bao special issue on New Year's Day of the 28th year.

On the first day of the publication of Shen Bao in Hong Kong, I wrote the opening remarks, comparing the process of human evolution, from the first month of fetal life to childbirth, from crawling at one year old to adulthood, to the current state of the earth. Mankind is not yet fifteen or sixteen years old. Why? In a civilized and peaceful era, there is no military science, only other sciences. Now, try to have the League of Nations designate all countries in the world to convert their military spending into national production costs. What worries are there about insufficient education and relief funds! What worries are there about the non-emergence of a world of great harmony! What worries are there about the non-existence of a pure land of great countries! Even in the case of our aggressive neighbor, if they were to shift their military spending of one hundred and several tens of millions to domestic agriculture, industry, and commerce, how could it be that the middle class would have to worry about selling their wives and children to avoid starvation, and there would be no need to send young soldiers who were originally farmers, workers, and merchants abroad, turning them into hundreds of thousands of corpses? How could countless young women lose their husbands? How could countless boys and girls lose their parents? As for our invaded country, we are their guests, facing bankruptcy, unemployment, sacrificed lives, and the dishonor and suicide of women. I don't know how many – life is only a hundred years, this kind of double-loss calculation is hateful and laughable to think about – if the law of karma still exists, then they are reaping what they sow, isn't it that seventy million madmen are digging their own graves—

The greatest precept of our Confucius' teachings says: "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself;" Christianity says: "Love your neighbor as yourself"; Buddhism says: "Save yourself and then save others." But now, they specialize in doing to others what they do not want done to themselves, they do not want to be robbed, but they especially love to rob, they do not want others to commit adultery, but they especially love to commit adultery with others. The Spring and Autumn period avenged nine generations of grievances. Our country's successive descendants calculate this endless blood debt, and East Asian peace is out of the question. Even Western countries have to increase their military preparations because their territories in the Far East are under pressure, making world peace forever impossible. Aren't they human traitors and monsters of the world?

Then are we without sin? Saying: How can we be without sin? They have been plotting against us for more than thirty years, while we have been ignorant and stupid, engaging in the activities of rats in their holes. Before the Xi'an Incident, the various ports of Ning, Han, and Guangdong were constantly changing, and history books could not record them all, as if they were children fighting each other in a closed era. Our people do not know the big picture of the world, do not know the ambitions of strong countries, and suffer the high-handed rule and exploitation of warlords (such as Sichuan's grain tax, which can be collected until the 50th or 60th year of the Republic of China), and do not know that disorder and insult are always one and the same. People insult themselves before others insult them, "A country must first attack itself before others attack it." The consequences our country suffers today are all the result of the causes we planted in the past. Lü Ziyun said, "All the things of the past are like yesterday's death, and all the things of the future are like today's birth." We should sincerely resent and blame ourselves, comparing ourselves to the barbarians. In the future, when we fight back to our homeland, we must still uphold the sacred teachings of "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself" and do not inflict atrocities of rape and murder on the innocent [Japanese] people. This is also what the law of karma should foresee, not the mockery of Duke Xiang of Song's benevolence.

All living things love their lives. What distinguishes humans from animals is that, while both love our lives, there is something more worthy of love than life, which is even more important than life. Mencius said: "Life is what I desire, and righteousness is also what I desire. If I cannot have both, I will give up life for righteousness." The noble integrity of Wen Tianxiang and Qu Shisi has been cultivated by this one thought. Even the common people who complete their integrity and achieve benevolence, never regretting their deaths, may not necessarily be literate, but their aroused conscience is enough to move the wind and rain and make ghosts and gods weep. Those who willingly accept the whip in order to survive are truly equal to lower animals—today, the people in the occupied areas, those who are willing to be puppets, losing their minds and going crazy, are ultimately in the minority. If they are united and redeemed with morality, the hearts of the people will yearn for Han [Chinese], and changing the flag will be a matter of moments—try to look at the land today, whose world is it anyway? I will predict it in the first year of the 28th year!
