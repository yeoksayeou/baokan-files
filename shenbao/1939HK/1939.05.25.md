### Danzig and the Lugou Bridge

The Danzig problem has become extremely serious these past few days. In particular, after the German shock troops attacked the Polish customs post at Bickel on the 21st, the entire Danzig area has been plunged into a "calm before the storm" situation.

The Danzig problem is not new. Fascist Germany's conspiracy to seize Danzig and attack Poland is not only a pre-planned scheme, but tens of thousands of thugs have already secretly infiltrated and are active. This activity has also been condoned by democratic countries, especially × country. The situation is just like the Lugou Bridge incident on the eve of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937. Therefore, at this time when Germany is stepping up its conspiracy to attack, and when the German-Italian military alliance was signed the day before yesterday, and when Britain, France, and other countries believe that concessions have reached the final juncture and announced their agreement to form a military alliance with the Soviet Union, people will say that Danzig will be Europe's Lugou Bridge!

Will Danzig ultimately become Europe's Lugou Bridge? Although it remains to be seen whether Germany and Italy, especially Hitler, can pull back from the brink, and although it remains to be seen whether Britain and France, especially Chamberlain, can take genuine measures to safeguard collective security and closely unite with the Soviet Union, we can clearly point out at least the following three points today:

First, since the establishment of the German-Italian "Anti-Communist" pact, it has long been a military alliance attempting to attack democratic and peaceful countries, re-divide colonies, and even re-make the world map. However, some capitalist countries, especially × country's financial capitalists and government, still fantasize that the likes of Hitler and Mussolini can genuinely cooperate to oppose communism and then unite with Britain and France to form a four-power group, organize an anti-communist crusade, and transfer the European crisis to the red Russian continent. However, now there are not only the bloody and tearful facts of Austria, Spain, Czechoslovakia, and Albania, but Hitler and Mussolini have also automatically torn off the "anti-communist" mask, exposing their ambition to attack democratic and peaceful countries and redistribute the world, and announced the formal signing of the German-Italian military alliance! Thus, Mr. Chamberlain's fantasies have been fundamentally shattered.

Second, forbearance and concession have reached the final juncture. The vast majority of the British people, the Communist Party, the Labour Party, the Liberal Party, and even many far-sighted people in the Conservative Party, have awakened and will rise up. This will be the greatest force that will make Mr. Chamberlain have to change his policy. The British government will have no choice but to strengthen its solidarity and cooperation with France, the United States, and the Soviet Union to resist fascist aggressors.

Third, the international situation is developing in the direction of resisting and counterattacking fascist aggressors. At the same time, the result of the fascist aggression policy is also leading the economic situation and the entire people of Germany and Italy towards poverty, darkness, and death. Under these internal and external pressures, Germany and Italy can only step up their speculative and adventurous steps, shifting the internal crisis from newer and larger wars and overwhelming the anti-aggression front that has not yet been consolidated and expanded.

Whether the city of Danzig will become Europe's Lugou Bridge is no longer the main issue today! The question now is: Can the anti-aggression front be increasingly consolidated and developed? That is, we must ask whether the tripartite political and military mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can be publicly established and earnestly implemented? Moreover, in view of the interconnectedness of the world in the current major war crisis and the truth that "peace is indivisible," we must further ask: Can the anti-aggression front include the Far East and be increasingly consolidated and developed? That is, can the friendly relations between Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and China be further consolidated and developed to form a mutual assistance organization? If the answers to these questions are affirmative, then, although Danzig or other regions are in immediate danger of becoming Europe's Lugou Bridge, and although the Second World War, which hundreds of millions of people have been worried about for years, is about to fully erupt (many people are unwilling to admit the fact that the World War has already begun since the Mukden Incident and the Spanish War), however, looking at the big picture and the long term, we can predict: Due to the absolute superiority and majestic strength of the anti-aggression front, due to the internal crisis and weakness of the aggressors, and due to the greater progress of China's anti-aggression struggle, even if it is a world war, the duration of the war is expected to be shortened, the cruelty of the war is also expected to be reduced, and human culture will suffer less damage. Conversely, if the answers to these questions are negative, then, even if the current war continues to remain temporarily in the "local stage," the result of continuing to reward the aggressors will make the future of the world truly unbearable and unimaginable!

### The Political Power in the Anti-Japanese Base Area in Southeastern Shanxi (II)

— Ke Han

In order to understand the work of the lower-level administrative organs, the Special Commissioner's Office organized an inspection group, divided into several groups of three to five people each, to go to various places for inspection, in order to communicate opinions and spirit between the upper and lower levels and improve the lower-level administrative organs.

As for personnel, there have been very good adjustments from the system to the district. Taking the Fifth District as an example, among the thirteen county magistrates, except for Changzi, the other twelve counties have all been replaced with important personnel. Those corrupt and degenerate bureaucrats who only knew how to be officials and did not care about the people, and who panicked at the sound of gunfire, have been gradually eliminated and replaced by a group of young people with red blood and loyalty, full of enthusiasm, most of whom are talented people from the Sacrifice League. In order to adjust personnel, the government also opened training classes for administrative personnel, specializing in training a group of government section chiefs, district chiefs, and village chiefs. Such training classes in the Fifth Administrative District continued for five sessions, and individual counties also held their own training classes to train lower-level administrative personnel.

These young people, who had never handled official business before, were no worse at "official business" than their predecessors. With their youthful enthusiasm, they promoted the entire political power and made local administrative work lively, tense, and full of vitality. When you pass by the village office in a village or the district office in a town, you can often see the village chief's or district chief's house crowded with a large group of people, arguing enthusiastically in their local dialects about some problem. People who are not familiar with the situation in southeastern Shanxi would think they are arguing, but in fact, they are holding a joint meeting of village deputies or village chiefs to discuss the local administrative work of a village or a district. If something cannot be resolved, hold a meeting to discuss it together - this is the unique style of young local officials.

They are not only very organized and disciplined in their work, but also very disciplined in their lives. Taking the county government as an example, all staff members get up at 5 or 6 o'clock to do morning exercises and hold morning meetings, and the county magistrate leads them in climbing mountains and running. Several times, when reporters were rushing on the road, they climbed over the saddle early in the morning and drove out of the city. At the foot of the city, they could often hear the commands of "one, two, one." The staff of the county government and the People's Armed Self-Defense Forces were drilling together on a lawn. They have also established a learning life. Every staff member must read newspapers and books, which has almost become a habit. In some counties, they even hold study group discussions every night. Thus, the government is both an administrative organ and a learning organ.

With such a group of young people who are enthusiastic about their work and live such a rigorous life, their frugality and integrity are not a problem. Their unified salary has been reduced considerably. In the Third District, the uniform treatment is 20 yuan. Of course, during the Anti-Japanese War, such a salary was not considered the lowest. However, compared to the past, when a section chief received hundreds of yuan a month and still sought various extra income, there is an unimaginable difference. In fact, they usually take out a portion of their 20 yuan salary for various donations, such as comforting soldiers and contributing money. Government workers always stand at the forefront and enthusiastically advocate these activities.

The integrity of government workers and the frugality of government funds not only reduced the burden on the people but also increased the people's faith in the government. Only when government personnel live frugally can the people's prejudices against the government be eliminated.

The fifth characteristic is the combativeness of the government. In areas close to the × area, this combativeness can be fully demonstrated. For example, in Pingding and Xiyang on the Zhengtai Railway, and Yuci, Taigu, and Hongdong on the Tongpu Line, they often live under the noses of the × people. In some places, the × people live at the foot of the mountain, and they live on the mountain. In some places, the × people live on the mountain, and they live in the valley, less than ten li apart. Yet they can carry out their government work in the base area as if nothing had happened. They have the protection of the masses. The masses act as their scouts, and the masses stand in the front to give them sentry duty. Also, counties such as Pingding, Xiyang, Heshun, Yuanxian, Qinshui, Fushan, and Yucheng are often subjected to counterattacks by the × people. They can very flexibly meet the × people's attacks. When the × people occupy the city, they can lead the local armed masses to surround the × people and fight guerrilla warfare until the × people cannot stand it and withdraw. Then they can quickly stabilize social order. It should be especially pointed out that when these counties initially restored political power, only a dozen villages were under their jurisdiction. Now our political power has expanded to the entire county. The Eastern Route Office of the Sixth Administrative District even organized a × Area Work Group to go deep into the cities and villages occupied by the × people to carry out the work of winning over the masses and shaking the puppet organizations. They carried a large number of official propaganda materials to the × area for distribution. Compared with the political power of the puppet government organized by the Japanese special service agencies, the anti-Japanese government led by our National Government is vastly different. No wonder the puppet provincial governors and puppet county magistrates had to cry out, "There is no province to govern" and "There is no county to govern."

In the various county local governments in the hinterland of southeastern Shanxi, after the Nine-Route Encirclement, there was a period when the × people did not dare to try to insert themselves into the hinterland of southeastern Shanxi again. It appeared to be a "nation-building" government, but in the work of preparing to welcome the new offensive of the × people this time, it still showed its combativeness. When the × people occupied Lingdao County and Heshun, the administrative workers in these counties issued a very meaningful slogan: "It's good for the × people to come once. One time can be a test of our work." They simply regard the × people's attack as an exam paper. Good students are not afraid of exams sooner or later. Today, each county is actively arranging its wartime work. They have already planned how to divide the county government into two or three parts to continue to promote administrative work when the × people insert both feet into the hinterland and the county and district areas are divided into two or three parts.

The above is a description of the characteristics of the political power in southeastern Shanxi, which can also be said to be its advantages. It should be stated that these advantages are due to the leadership of Commander Yan, who promulgated the decrees to abolish exorbitant taxes and reduce rent and interest. It was he who boldly promoted and used young people to government agencies regardless of whether they had experience in administrative work, and allowed them to work freely. But at the same time, it should also be stated that the people who directly implement Commander Yan's will are also extremely important. The political power work in other regions may not be as successful as in southeastern Shanxi. In the middle of this, the Sacrifice National Salvation League and the Public Justice Corps also play an undeniable role. In the entire Shanxi Province, southeastern Shanxi is probably the region with the greatest influence of the Sacrifice Public League. They almost have the same power as the county government, especially the Sacrifice League. There is almost nothing that it does not ask about. Also, because many county magistrates are from the Sacrifice League, they are led by the Sacrifice League organization and listen to the opinions of the Sacrifice League organization. Local administrative chiefs often put forward the slogan of the Sacrifice League line and require their subordinates to strictly implement the Sacrifice League line.

But southeastern Shanxi cannot be said to be a 100% perfect area. It still has some defects:

First, in terms of democratic politics, it should be pointed out that the election of village chiefs is not necessarily carried out normally in some areas. In some places, regardless of whether the village chief is good or bad, they listen to the masses to re-elect, so that the newly elected village chief is not as good as the old village chief. In some places, there is often factionalism when electing village chiefs, with the new village chief opposing the old village chief, and Village A opposing Village B, resulting in mutual competition, mutual exclusion, and the brewing of bad disputes. It can also be seen that while giving the masses democratic rights, it is also necessary to train the masses to exercise their democratic rights. Now, the government agencies have already noticed this point, and their approach is to grant the masses democratic rights as much as possible in principle, but at the same time, the elected village chief must be approved by the government, or the masses elect two or three people, and the government determines the final choice.

Secondly, the administrative meetings have not played their due role. In individual counties, administrative meetings are still just a formality and cannot fully reflect public opinion and truly promote the spirit of people's participation in government. In the expanded administrative meetings held in the Third and Fifth Administrative Districts recently, this issue was especially emphasized and the organization of the administrative meetings was enriched. There should be a change in the future.

Second, the reform of the government structure is not thorough. It is possible that the county magistrate is good, and the police chief is good, but the section chief is not necessarily good. In particular, the messengers, guardhouse, and political and legal departments often retain their old habits. The lower the level, the more inadequate the reform is. This situation is more common in the Fifth District, especially in the more remote villages. It is precisely because the lower-level organizations are not yet very sound that the government and the masses cannot be integrated, and the masses still have doubts about the government in certain places. We sincerely hope that the wise local officials in southeastern Shanxi can go further and make further in-depth reforms to the administrative organs.

### The Focus of the War Is Still in Northern Hubei, Our Pursuit Troops Are Advancing Towards Yingshan, Eastern Zhejiang and Southern Guangdong Are Under Our Control

[Special Telegram from Our Newspaper in Chongqing on the 24th] The focus of the war is still in Hubei Province. We are increasing our fresh troops to pursue the × people who are retreating westward.

After three hours of fierce fighting, the × people were defeated and fled back to Chezhen. The casualties were quite numerous. Also, the chief who committed suicide in Deping was Matsuno. This was due to the prolongation of the war, the depletion of national strength, and resentment against the upper-level warlords who still refused to reflect.

[Telegram from the Central News Agency in Jinhua on the 23rd] On the evening of the 13th, our unit in western Zhejiang launched a fierce attack on Chongde County. The × people were caught off guard and we rushed into the city, annihilating all the × troops entrenched in the city.

Several × military officers in the car were injured and fled.

### The Situation on Gulangyu Is Worsening, Four-Nation Talks Have Reached a Stalemate, the British Firmly Refuse to Discuss the Issue of Administrative Power in the Concession, the × Attitude Is Overbearing, Sending Warships to Cut Off Traffic to the Island

[Report from Hong Kong] According to informal sources, the talks between the naval representatives of Britain, the United States, and France and the Japanese side on Gulangyu have reached a stalemate because the Japanese side insists on demanding amendments to the concession charter to increase the number of Japanese directors on the Gulangyu Municipal Council by three. According to reliable sources, British Naval Commander Noble has firmly refused to discuss this issue, stating that he is unwilling to discuss anything other than the issue of Japanese naval landing. The talks were held yesterday morning on the British warship Birmingham. British Naval Commander Admiral Noble, the new Coastal Navy Commander Vice Admiral Parker, Commander of the US South China Fleet Stapler, and Japanese Naval Commander Vice Admiral Kondo all attended. The talks began at 10:00 AM and ended at noon. After the meeting, Japanese Commander Kondo immediately returned to his warship and summoned the head of the Xiamen Special Service Agency and Japanese Consul in Xiamen, Uchida, for urgent discussions. Afterwards, Uchida submitted a new protest to the consular corps, stating, "The landing of British, American, and French navies on Gulangyu is not only an unfriendly attitude towards Japan, but also sufficient to encourage anti-Japanese elements in the concession. The Japanese authorities regard the tense situation caused by the landing of the navies of Britain, the United States, and France as extremely serious." Uchida also put forward five counter-demands: (1) The Gulangyu Municipal Council should effectively manage the concession to prevent it from turning into an anti-Japanese base. (2) The Municipal Council and the police station should be reorganized. (3) Taiwanese people should be granted the right to vote in the Municipal Council. (4) The three vacant seats of the Chinese directors should be replaced by personnel from the Xiamen puppet maintenance association. (5) The Municipal Council and the Japanese consular police should cooperate closely. At the same time, according to the Japanese side, because the negotiations have now failed, the Japanese navy is implementing a blockade of Gulangyu, with only Xiamen as the only road. A Japanese cruiser has dropped anchor between Gulangyu and the Fujian coast to cut off traffic to that side. Other areas are also fully guarded by Japanese patrol ships, and only ships approved by the Japanese are allowed to sail. At the same time, a flagship and a destroyer also departed from Tokyo for Gulangyu yesterday, so the number of foreign warships concentrated there has reached as many as ten, and the atmosphere is quite tense.

Tokyo Is Making Empty Threats to the Three Countries Again

[Reuters Report from Tokyo on the 24th] Today, the Japanese newspapers here prominently published news about the meeting of the naval representatives of Britain, the United States, France, and Japan on Gulangyu on the British warship "Birmingham." According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the Japanese naval authorities have decided to cut off traffic between Gulangyu and Fujian Province to isolate Gulangyu from the outside world, but it can still communicate with Xiamen. The newspaper also said that if Japan's "reasonable demands" are rejected and the powers take joint action to intimidate, Japan will strictly implement its policies without any concessions.

[Telegram from the Central News Agency in Washington on the 23rd]　The State Department said that US officials are currently considering how to deal with the current situation on Gulangyu.

### × Is Threatening the Concessions Everywhere Again, Saying They Will Send Troops into the Concessions and Will Not Allow Foreign Forces to Interfere

[Reuters Report from Tokyo on the 24th] A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry said today, "Japan has decided to use force to drive out anti-Japanese elements in the concessions throughout China. Because these elements are instructed by the Kuomintang, they should be regarded as Chinese activities. We will not allow interference from foreign forces in these measures. Japan must participate in the management rights of the Public Concessions. If the situation requires it, Japan has the right to send troops into the concessions."

### Johnson Arrives in Shanghai

### On the Ganbei Front Line

— Fan Shizhi

(I) The Story of Climbing the City

On April 25th, Ga'an City had been surrounded by a certain regiment of a certain division of our army. Due to the lack of heavy weapons, there was no better way than climbing the city for the solid city walls. On that day, platoon leader Yu Guangyi led a platoon of soldiers to prepare to climb the city, while the regimental commander stood by and watched.

They arrived at the edge of the north gate, where the outside of the city was a high ground, which seemed easier to climb. The brothers gently leaned the scaling ladder against the city wall. The × army guarding the city did not care at all. At this time, platoon leader Yu took the lead in climbing, when suddenly, an enlisted man, Li Wenrong, who had been in the army for less than four months, came up and reported to the platoon leader: "Platoon leader, you can't climb, I should climb first!" The platoon leader said to him, "You have been in the army for less than four months and don't know the danger, I should climb first." After the platoon leader said this, he climbed up the ladder. When he reached the top, a × army soldier suddenly stabbed at him with a bayonet, injuring Yu's left arm. Yu immediately threw a hand grenade at the × army, killing two × soldiers. Another × soldier opened fire, and Yu was shot and killed, rolling down the city wall. The next one to go up was a squad leader and four soldiers, who were all shot and killed. At this time, our attack was slightly frustrated, and the soldiers all watched and did not move forward. Private Li Wenrong then jumped forward, took the wooden-shell gun that platoon leader Yu had left on the ladder, and went straight up the ladder. The soldiers were inspired by him and were unwilling to fall behind, and seven or eight people followed up the ladder. When Li Wenrong reached the top, he first threw a hand grenade into the × machine gun bunker, killing four × soldiers. Then, he continued to fire the wooden-shell gun at the city, also injuring three × soldiers. The × army on the city urgently opened fire and shot at Li indiscriminately. As a result, Li was shot in the eye, left chest, and buttocks, and also rolled down the city wall. He was carried to a field hospital for treatment by stretcher-bearers.

Because they all knew what the most glorious death was. For the eternal life of the Chinese nation, inspired, motivated, and touched by their great spirit. At 2:20 AM on the 26th, our army finally captured Ga'an City.

(II) Annotation of the War of Attrition

About 30 li northeast of Ga'an, the Pig Mother Great Hill relied on solid bunkers to defend. We failed to attack twice. Company commander Li Quanlong was very annoyed. That night, he sent a platoon of brothers to attack at night. Just as they touched the vicinity of the bunker and were about to start their action, they heard a series of explosions from the kerosene tanks, and the × machine guns fired like a string of pearls. We lost five more brothers, but they were all wondering where the sound of the kerosene tanks came from. That night, they went back and held a small group meeting. After discussing the results, they learned that the × people had tied the kerosene tanks to a large tree about five or six zhang outside the bunker, with a wooden block tied inside the tank and connected to the inside of the bunker with a wire. When the guard heard any movement outside, he would repeatedly pull the wire back and forth, and the tank would make a booming sound, so the sleeping × bandits inside the bunker would know to be on guard. We came to this conclusion, and the next night, we sent a brother to slowly摸to the side of the kerosene tank, gently tied a rope to the wire, and held the other end of the rope in his hand, tiptoeing to the hillside below the side of the bunker, which was a blind spot. The × machine guns couldn't hit it no matter what. So he pulled the rope, and the oil tank响了. The × bandits in the bunker woke up from their dreams one after another. In the darkness, they grabbed the machine gun handle and fired back and forth vigorously for 20 minutes, seeing that there was no movement outside. They went back to sleep again. But as soon as they fell asleep, the oil tank响了 again. So they got up and fired again. After doing this twice, the × bandits inside the bunker couldn't sleep peacefully all night.

The next day, the × bandits patrolled around the bunker, but found nothing. At night, they came four times in the same way. The × bandits knew that it was our attacking troops playing tricks on them, but because it was dark, they didn't know the strength of our army, so they didn't dare to come out to search. So they just let the bullets suffer. After firing霹霹拍打for another night, these × bandits didn't get any sleep for two nights.

The next day, the kerosene tank rang again. The × bandits thought it was still the same trick. Exhausted, they ignored it and buried their heads to sleep. The kerosene tank rang twice, but there was no movement in the bunker. By the third time, there was still no movement. At this time, our night raiding army saw that they had ambushed all around, so they rushed forward, climbed up the bunker from the scaling ladder, and threw hand grenades into the machine gun holes in all directions. All the 20 or so × bandits in the bunker were wiped out by us. The Pig Sand Great Hill was thus quickly and completely occupied by us.

(III) Brilliant Future

Battalion commander Wu Xizhao took two brothers to the front line to inspect the position. From a distance, he saw three or forty ×bandits approaching to search for us. For a moment, there was nowhere to hide. Battalion commander was anxious and suddenly had an idea. Seeing a solitary big tree on the earthen hill in front, he climbed to the treetop and said to his two brothers, "You can shoot in the direction I designate to warn the ×bandits." The two brothers obeyed the order and left. (To be continued)

### Kunming Education During Wartime

[Kunming Special Dispatch] Since the war of resistance entered the first stage, Kunming has become an important rear base and an important station on the southwestern international transportation route. It might be welcomed by overseas readers to introduce the situation of the education sector here!

After the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, China's culture gradually moved inward. The following universities successively moved to Kunming: The Southwest Associated University, Sun Yat-sen University, Zhongzheng Medical College, Central Political School Branch, Tongji University, Tangshan Institute of Technology, National Art College, Huazhong University, etc. For a time, the ancient city in the south became a hub of culture. The situations of the universities are briefly described below:

National Yunnan University. Its predecessor was Donglu University, founded by General Tang Jiyao, which was later renamed Yunnan Provincial University, with colleges of arts, law, science, engineering, and a medical training program (including four years of internship). The students were mainly from the province, with a few from Hunan and Guizhou. In June of last year, the Ministry of Education ordered the preparation for nationalization, with Xiong Qinglai as the director of preparation. It was formally established in January of this year, still headed by Xiong, with Xiao Shuyu as the director of academic affairs, Xu Shengzu as the secretary, Wu Jianyi as the director of the training committee, Xiao Shuyu as the dean of the College of Arts and Law, the president of the College of Science concurrently, Yang Jiyan as the dean of the College of Engineering, and Fan Bingzhe as the dean of the College of Medicine, which was changed from the medical training program. The school accepts both male and female students. Because the coastal provinces have 相继沦为 guerrilla war zones, many transfer students and visiting students from outside have joined. At the same time, after the reorganization of the National University, the level has been greatly improved, so a preparatory course (equivalent to a university preparatory course) and a tutorial class have been added to allow graduates of various middle schools in the province to衔接in their academic programs. Recently, the school was ordered by the Ministry of Education to set up a mining training program,收高中毕业 students, with a two-year study period, to prepare for the exploitation of underground富源, but to bear the supply of the long-term war of resistance. In mid-February, the school invited Mr. Tang Huisun to prepare for the establishment of an agricultural college. There are five or six senior and junior agricultural schools in the province. When this plan is realized in the future, agricultural学生 will have more opportunities to go to school.

National Southwest Associated University. The schools were jointly formed by Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University. Each of them has a glorious history in the past. After the merger, they first moved to Changsha, Hunan, and then moved to Kunming in March of last year. Jiang Menglin, Mei Yi-qi, and Zhang Boling (Mr. Zhang is the deputy speaker of the National Senate and is stationed in Chongqing all year round, so Huang Yusheng is acting on his behalf.) serve as members of the school committee. Below are ten departments, including the secretary department, with Yang Zhensheng as the secretary-general, Shen Lv as the director of academic affairs, Jiang Jichang as the director of general affairs, Huang Yusheng as the director of construction, Feng Youlan as the dean of the College of Arts, Chen Xujing as the dean of the College of Law and Commerce, Wu Youxun as the dean of the College of Science, Shi Jiayang as the dean of the College of Engineering, Huang Yusheng as the dean of the Teachers College, and Yuan Tongli as the director of the library. There are more than 2,000 students, and the entire new building of Kunhua Agricultural School is used as the main campus. The classrooms and dormitories are 不敷分配, and Kunhua Middle School, Kunhua Normal School, and Kunhua Xiaoxue are also used. Fortunately, the schools in this province are generally疏散to various prefectures and counties by order of the Department of Education to avoid air raids, so it is not a problem. Recently, the agricultural school is going to收回self-use, which has cost the school's responsible personnel quite a bit of hesitation. Therefore, they have started to build new school buildings. On the New Year's Eve, the school's drama troupe presented "Motherland" as a幕剧, to raise shoes and socks for the front-line soldiers, with very good results, with a净余 of more than 1,000 yuan. The director of "Motherland" is Professor Chen Ling, and the protagonist is Ms. Fengzi, both of whom are famous figures in the theater world.

National Sun Yat-sen University. The school was founded in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China. Mr. Zou Haibin was the president. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, it was expanded into seven colleges of arts, law, science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, and normal school. In October of last year, Guangzhou was lost. Through Guilin 遷滇复课, the director of affairs, Zou Zhuoran, came to Yunnan to negotiate. A temporary campus has been selected in Ganjiang. More than 100 professors have arrived in Yunnan. There are 2,300 undergraduate students in the previous academic year. Adding this year's freshmen, there are a total of 2,800 students. They are currently 陆续来滇. The last batch arrived in Kunming on the 12th. They rented Qinggong School in the urban area as a temporary campus in order to接洽遄赴征江报到上课.

National Zhongzheng Medical College. The college is a national medical school. In November of the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, the Jiangxi Provincial Government劃architectural基500餘亩, with a construction cost of more than 600,000, which took one year to complete. To commemorate Committee Chairman Chiang's special achievements in governing Jiangxi, it was named "Zhongzheng." Classes started in September of the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, with a total of 220 students. Currently, 85 male and 31 female students have arrived in Yunnan and are temporarily taking classes in the教室 of the Christian YMCA. They have recently建适合战时需要的经济校舍on the outskirts of Kunming. (Most of the building materials are made of clay.) The school's founding purpose is different from that of general medical students. The study period is five years, and after graduation, they will be cadres for promoting the public health system. Because most of the current medical studies are completed in six or seven years, and after graduation, they may not all serve the society, and even set up private clinics, charging high fees, which makes the poor见而却步. The public health system is that medical students should all serve the country and society, relieve the diseases and pains of the general public, so that there will no longer be class discrimination in health care. The president is Wang Zihan, who has served as the president of Xiangya Hospital in Changsha for many years.

Central Political School Branch. The school is located in Dali. Last year, Professor Tang Huisun was sent to Yunnan to prepare for it. Later, because Tang was transferred to the Qunxi Reclamation Company to preside over the business, Professor Wang Maozu was responsible for the preparation. The school site has been selected in Dali, in order to give students in remote areas the opportunity to study. The school has started classes for the initial students this semester, and the senior students are preparing for enrollment.

National Tongji University. The school was initially founded by Germans, named Tongji School, with medical and engineering departments. It was officially renamed National Tongji University in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, and the government allocated annual funding. Later, the Labor University奉令merged with the school as an affiliated industrial vocational school, and an affiliated middle school was also added. After the August 13th Incident, the Ministry ordered the school to move to Jinhua, Zhejiang, and then to Kunming. There are currently more than 900 students. The president is Weng Zhilong, the secretary-general is Zhang Zhaozhi, Chen Shaoxian, the director of academic affairs is Tang Mei, the dean of the College of Medicine is Ning Yu, the dean of the College of Science is Wang Baoren, Wu Zhihan is the dean of the College of Engineering, Tang Mei is the dean of the affiliated vocational school, Feng Chengzhi is the director of the affiliated middle school, and there are about 250 faculty and staff members. The Colleges of Science and Engineering are at Fuchun Middle School 上,課the medical school is located in Jinbi Park, and the training hospital is the Provincial Kunhua Hospital.

National Tangshan Institute of Technology. The institute is one of the research institutes of National Jiaotong University, founded in the late Qing Dynasty, and has a history of 34 years. In the past, the institute focused on teaching civil engineering and metallurgy. Later, due to the war of resistance, the civil engineering department was moved to Hunan, and merged with the Railway Management College of Jiaotong University to form the Railway Management Office. The remaining parts moved to Hunan in March of last year. Because Hunan Province was still close to the front line, the Ministry ordered the school to move to Yunnan on November 14 of the same year. The person in charge of preparation, Luo Zhongchen, Li Pei, and Ye Jiayuan, set up an office at Kunming Sandongshu, and selected a school site in Yuxi. The school has had 28 classes of graduates over the years, with a total of more than 2,000 people. Most of them are now serving on the Dianmian and叙昆roads, making great contributions. There are four classes of students in the student body, totaling more than 400 people, both male and female. The president is Mao Yisheng.

National College of Art. The school was formed by the merger of the National Art College of Hangzhou and the National Art College of Peiping. Last year, it moved to Huanling, Hunan, and was once改组. The original presidents of the two schools, Lin Fengmian and Zhao Qi, resigned one after another. The Ministry appointed Teng Gu as the president, and expanded and adjusted the original departments, which were divided into three departments: specialized art, applied art, and senior art vocational school. The calligrapher Chang Shuhong and the sculptor Wang Ziyun served as directors respectively. Pure art is divided into painting, sculpture, architecture, and printmaking. Applied art is divided into工艺美术, and dyeing and weaving patterns. The senior art vocational school uses the equipment of various departments to set up practical technical training classes. There are about 300 students and more than 30 faculty and staff members. They have all陆续到滇 and have selected Lufeng as the school site. The Kunming office is located at No. 112 Jinniu Street.

Huazhong University. The school was established in the twentieth year of the Republic of China and was formed by the merger of four universities: Wenhua, Yali, Hubin, and Bowen. It was originally located in Wuchang. Later, due to the war of resistance, it moved south to Guilin. Recently, due to the tense air raids in Guilin, it took advantage of the end of the semester to move to Yunnan to resume classes. There are currently 300 students, who have陆续由龙州转滇越铁路来省. The school site is Dali or Xizhou, which has not yet been completely decided. It is divided into two colleges of arts and sciences, with Cao Zhuomin as the president, Capen as the dean of the College of Science, and Hu Yi, the president of the College of Arts, concurrently as the dean of the College of Education. The temporary office is currently located in the Zion Church on Jinbi Road.

The situation of higher education has been described above. As for military schools, which are related to national defense, they should be kept secret, so I will omit them.

### The Anglo-Franco-Soviet Agreement Will Be Concluded Soon: The Geneva Negotiations Have Been Successfully Concluded: The British Foreign Secretary Returns Home to Attend a Cabinet Meeting

[Reuters, Paris, 14th] It is reported from Geneva that Halifax and Maisky have reached an agreement in principle on the Anglo-Soviet mutual assistance agreement. Only the final approval of the British and Soviet governments is required. The French side expressed satisfaction with this report.

[Reuters, Paris, 24th] All newspapers in Paris unanimously stated that after the talks between British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Soviet Ambassador to Britain Hansky, the conclusion of an Anglo-Soviet agreement to jointly resist aggression is almost a foregone conclusion.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 24th] British Foreign Secretary Halifax has returned to the country from Geneva, bringing with him proposals regarding the Anglo-Soviet agreement. The British Cabinet is scheduled to meet before "Pentecost" (i.e., today) to consider the proposals. It is expected that as soon as the British Cabinet makes a decision, it will notify Moscow. As for the basis of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations in Geneva, it was already established in London. According to the Times, the above-mentioned basis is roughly in line with the compromise plan proposed by France, which includes: (1) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union issue a joint declaration stating that any act of aggression against one of the allied countries is an aggression against all the allied countries, and the guarantee measures provided by the allied countries to each other will be implemented immediately; (2) Submit a report on various small countries (whether the independence of the countries has been guaranteed or not) in order to divide the Valley Small countries into (A) the scope of interests of Britain and France, (B) the scope of interests of the Soviet Union; (3) Establish a method of mutual consultation to deal with unpredictable changes. "Daily Express" also reported that British Foreign Secretary Halifax also asked Soviet Ambassador遇斯基 whether he could ask Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to visit London.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 23rd] British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet returned to the country from Geneva in the same car tonight at 力时半. Everyone believed that the British, French, and Soviet mutual assistance agreement must be concluded quickly. People in the British delegation even declared that when the British Cabinet holds a cabinet meeting tomorrow, Foreign Secretary Halifax will report on the negotiations between him and the Soviet representatives, and submit a draft agreement. After the British Cabinet agrees, it will be sent to Moscow to solicit final approval. The agreement will be concluded in the near future. Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Polish representative Komarnicki and Romanian representativeクレシアノ respectively this afternoon, and informed them of the progress of the British and Soviet negotiations.

[Central News Agency, London, 24th] Reuters learned from foreign sources in London that Poland and Romania have agreed on the mutual assistance treaty between the two countries for many years, the original purpose of which was to oppose the Soviet Union. It has now been decided to apply it to other aspects of the attack. The general staff of the two countries has held talks to 俾实施 this agreed cooperation method. The two countries have no objection to the establishment of an agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, but this matter is attached to a condition, that is, Poland and Romania do not have to participate in it, because if Poland and Romania participate in it, some aspects can be interpreted as ×视Germany's actions. As far as Poland is concerned, its relationship with the Soviet Union has been regulated by the Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact of 1933.

Bonnet's Talk

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 24th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet made a surprising statement about the Anglo-Soviet agreement to Joel. San Owen, a Geneva-based correspondent for the "Paris Evening News." The statement appeared in yesterday's Evening News and read as follows: "I had lengthy talks with Soviet Ambassador Maisky and Sir Halifax, and as a result I am convinced that the ongoing trilateral negotiations will soon come to an end. France has long had an alliance with the Soviet Union. The conclusion of the new trilateral agreement proves the strengthening of our 'collective security system' and is a powerful tool for maintaining peace." San Owen praised Bonnet's活勸 in Geneva, and said that the French government's mediation was based on the following judgments: "Bonnet told the Soviet representative that 'Since there is a 1935 alliance treaty between France and the Soviet Union, giving the Soviet Union guarantees, and Britain and France are 休戚相关countries, all the conditions that the Soviet Union hopes for are in fact already completely there, only waiting for a suitable method to be drafted.' He also said to British Foreign Secretary Halifax, 'Given the existence of the Franco-Soviet agreement and the spirit of mutual assistance between Britain and France, Britain has already indirectly承担的the obligation to assist the Soviet Union.' Bonnet's theory is such that it can enable Britain and the Soviet Union to accept the plan he proposed." "Paris Evening News" also said, "Another treaty will be signed between France and Poland this week. The intention is to define the obligations borne by France and Poland under the outline of the new trilateral agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The same is true between Britain and Poland. As a result, the French plan can be easily implemented." "Paris Evening News" also predicts that the "Hetan" issue between France and 士will be resolved in the next few days. At that time, the Angolan government will be able to participate in the British-French agreement, but Romania's attitude is still uncertain. The雑government's determination to oppose active Soviet aid is still difficult to overcome.

### The League of Nations Will Again Request Member States to Provide Actual Assistance to Our War of Resistance; Designates a Committee to Review Our Country's Application; Britain and France Reaffirm Their Determination for International Cooperation

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 23rd] After holding an open meeting this afternoon, the League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed-door meeting to continue discussions on the Sino-Japanese dispute and draft a resolution. It is reported that the content will declare China as the victim of aggression and again suggest to member states that they provide assistance in various ways.

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 23rd] At this morning's closed-door meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet were unwilling to take further steps beyond implementing past resolutions passed by the League of Nations regarding the proposals made by our country's chief representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, in his speech to the Administrative Council yesterday. At that time, our country's representative insisted on our just and upright position, and the representatives of Poland, New Zealand, and the Soviet Union unanimously expressed their support for our position. The Administrative Council then decided to appoint representatives from Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Latvia, and our country to form a drafting committee to review Representative Koo's proposals. However, due to Britain's policy of not wanting to handle any important issues within the League of Nations structure, most people dare not harbor any illusions about whether the League of Nations can agree on concrete measures. The Administrative Council's Drafting Committee is scheduled to meet tonight or tomorrow. Swiss newspapers are currently commenting on yesterday's Administrative Council meeting, and they unanimously express pessimism about the future of the League of Nations.

[Reuters, Geneva, 23rd] The League of Nations Committee met today to draft a resolution in response to the application made yesterday by the Chinese representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, to the League of Nations Administrative Council. The resolution will reaffirm the League's recommendation to member states to provide actual assistance to China's war of resistance. Representatives from Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Latvia attended the committee.

[Reuters, Geneva, 23rd] British Foreign Secretary Halifax stated today that Britain has shouldered its obligations, "the purpose of which is to oppose the use of force, as the use of force will inevitably plunge civilization into anarchy." He did not disclose anything about the British-Soviet negotiations, but stated that, under these circumstances, it is impossible to implement the British government's actions within the League of Nations, so it can only strictly adhere to the principles of the League of Nations. He also said that after the British-Soviet negotiations are completed, the results will be notified to the League of Nations, and emphasized that the British government adheres to the ideal of international cooperation, and the League of Nations is a symbol of this cooperation. French Foreign Minister Bonnet also made a similar statement.

[Reuters, Geneva, 23rd] The League of Nations Administrative Council has decided that the League of Nations' relationship with Danzig will not be changed in any way and has instructed the League of Nations Commissioner in Danzig to return to his post and explain the current situation to the Danzig Senate.

### ### The Danzig Issue: The League of Nations' Three-Nation Committee Sends Personnel to Investigate the Truth

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 23rd] The League of Nations' Three-Nation Committee has decided to specially send the High Commissioner of the city of Danzig, Burckhardt, back to the city to submit a formal report on the truth of the situation there. People close to the French delegation compared Burckhardt's mission today to Sir Neill Malcolm's trip to Czechoslovakia last year, whose task was to determine whether the re-incorporation of Danzig into Germany was "the only reasonable solution to the Danzig issue." Political figures here seem to think that "the Danzig issue is not worth a war," but the Polish delegation is quite dissatisfied with the current trend of events.

### ### The Issue of Fortifying the Åland Islands Remains Unresolved; The Soviet Union Fears Falling into German Hands

[Central News Agency, Geneva, 23rd] The issue of fortifying the Åland Islands has not been resolved to this day due to the obstruction of the Soviet representative. According to League of Nations officials, the Soviet side believes that if the island is fortified, it will sooner or later become a German naval base. It is reported that Soviet Ambassador Maisky once said that the Finnish army is pro-German, and in the event of war, the Finns will hand over the island to Germany. Representatives of the Scandinavian countries opposed the Soviet Union's proposal to transfer the island to the next session of the autumn conference for discussion. The Soviet representative officially stated that he could not change his attitude without consulting his own government. Political figures here are at a loss as to the current stalemate, but it is generally believed that at tomorrow's meeting, representatives of the Scandinavian countries will again oppose the Soviet Union's discussion of the case.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 23rd] The issue of fortifying the Baltic Sea's Åland Islands was originally on the agenda of the League of Nations Administrative Council. After the Finnish government refused to notify the Soviet Union of detailed plans, the Soviet government recently ordered its representative to the League of Nations, Maisky, to request the Administrative Council to postpone the discussion. An announcement was also issued here stating that the Åland Islands are not far from the Gulf of Finland, and in the event of war in the future, other countries can use them as a base to block the Gulf of Finland and obstruct the entry and exit of Allied warships. It is also said that the issue of fortifying the island is of great importance to the Soviet Union, and it is necessary to notify the Allies of the content of the plan.

### ### Germans in Danzig Continue to Agitate

[Associated Press, Danzig, 23rd] It is reported that since the incident in Danzig on Sunday, several demonstrations have taken place in several towns. It is reported that Germans in Danzig gathered in front of the Bergiel customs building, loudly denounced the Poles, Nazi stormtroopers demonstrated everywhere, and destroyed the doors and windows of the customs building.

### ### U.S. Submarine [Squalus] Sinks After Accident; U.S. Government Stops Rescue

[Reuters, Portsmouth, 23rd] It is reported that the U.S. submarine "Squalus" sank after an accident near White Island. There were 62 people on board. According to reports, the submarine was on a routine underwater patrol at 2:40 PM today (British Standard Time), but after an hour (the usual patrol time for submarines in this situation is one hour), it still failed to surface. The submarine is now 240 feet below the surface of the sea. Its sister submarine "Sculpin" has been ordered to go to the scene of the accident and has been able to exchange messages with the "Squalus." Naval officers say the submarine is equipped with the latest safety equipment, so it can last at least 24 hours in the water. Authorities are now preparing to send divers into the sea to rescue the submarine. The cruiser "Brooklyn" has also been ordered to sail from New York to the scene of the incident. The director of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard said that surface ships can pump air into the "Squalus" so that the crew can survive for a week.

[Reuters, Portsmouth, 23rd] President Roosevelt told reporters in Washington today that he believed the crew of the submarine "Squalus" would be rescued. The U.S. government is now doing its best to dispatch personnel and equipment to the scene of the incident to carry out rescue operations. President Roosevelt is now in contact with the area via naval radio and said that the submarine "Squalus" is equipped with "lung" machines, and the crew can use these "lungs" to float to the surface, but this measure will not be taken unless absolutely necessary. He is trying to make the entire submarine float. The sea surface is calm and the rescue work is going smoothly.

[Associated Press, Washington, 24th] The U.S. Navy Department announced last night that the cause of the accident of the U.S. submarine "Squalus" is unknown. It is believed that the ship is now stranded on the seabed. Its sister ship "Sculpin" is now cruising the scene of the incident. The submarine rescue ship "Falcon" has rushed from New England to assist. It is verified that the Squalus is a newly built submarine in the United States, which was completed on May 1st. It was practicing sailing on the same day after completion. It departed from Portsmouth at 6:00 yesterday morning and was originally scheduled to return to port at 9:40 AM, but suddenly disappeared. Its sister ship Sculpin immediately went to investigate and finally found its location at 12:30 PM and immediately sent a radio request for assistance.

### ### British Embassy in the United States Prepares to Welcome the British King

[Associated Press, Washington, 23rd] British Ambassador to the United States, Lord and Lady Lindsay, announced today that the British Embassy will hold a garden party on October 8 to welcome the British King and Queen's visit to the United States. Guests invited to accompany them include John Lewis, chairman of the American Industrial Organization, Morgan, a banker from Carman Ganford, Colonel Lindbergh, an aviator, Rockefeller, the son of the late oil tycoon, former President Hoover, members of the DuPont family of arms tycoons, New York Mayor LaGuardia, and General Pershing and his wife, a general from the European War. In addition, the widows of former U.S. presidents, the widows of former ambassadors to Britain, and the surviving former ambassadors to Britain will all participate in the grand event.

### ### Wimbledon Car Accident: Queen Mary Slightly Injured; British King and Queen Arrive in Lake City

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The car carrying Queen Mary was hit by a truck in Wimbledon this afternoon. Fortunately, the Queen was not injured, but the royal physicians all hoped that the Queen would rest for twelve hours. The Queen's scheduled appointments have been cancelled and will be suspended to Epsom. According to eyewitnesses, the Queen's car collided with a truck, causing it to overturn. Fortunately, a painter nearby moved his ladder against the car, and the Queen was able to walk out of the car. The Queen and her lady-in-waiting were violently shaken by the car collision. Later, the Queen went to the residence of a nearby doctor for a short rest. When she drove away, the crowd cheered her, and the Queen smiled in return.

[Reuters, Shreveport, 23rd] When the British King and Queen arrived in Shreveport, they learned of the news of Queen Mary's car accident. The British King told a member of the welcoming committee here that the Queen was only slightly injured and there was no need to worry too much. It is not known whether the British King has telephoned London. The British King and Queen have now traveled to Lake City and are expected to arrive at approximately 11:00 PM (British Standard Time).

### ### Palestine Issue: British House of Commons Notified; Government White Paper; Opposition's Motion to Amend Rejected; House of Lords Also Approves Government Policy

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The British House of Commons continued to debate the Palestine issue today. Opposition Labor Party member Morrison criticized the government for breaking its promises and acting dishonorably. He said that the White Paper published by the British government contradicted previous declarations. The British government had promised the Jews to return to Palestine and restore their homeland, but now the status of the Jews has been reduced to a permanent minority. The Colonial Secretary has not announced how to protect Jewish civil rights, and the Jews will be sacrificed due to the British government's inability to govern and fear of assassination and violence. When the British government and the House of Commons finally draft a policy, they should not conflict with the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate Agreement and should seek the opinion of the Hague Arbitration Court. Most of the difficult situations in Palestine are caused by a minority among certain classes of Arabs, which may have been instigated by agents of Hitler and Mussolini. The British government's policy on resolving the Palestine issue should focus on the cooperation between the Arab and Jewish peoples to maintain order in the area. Liberal Party leader Sinclair then spoke, specifically pointing out that the White Paper was inconsistent with the Mandate Agreement. He argued that the government should discuss this matter with the Mandates Commission. Independent Labor Party member Maxton strongly opposed the government's White Paper. Conservative Party member Churchill also opposed the government's proposal. He said that the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate Agreement have been destroyed by the government's proposal. The opposition's motion to amend the government's plan was rejected by a vote of 281 to 181. The government's plan was passed by a majority of 268 to 179. The House of Lords also agreed to the government's plan and approved the White Paper policy.

Short Commentary

### About the League of Nations

Our country's representative to the League of Nations, Wellington Koo, proposed five points to the General Assembly: (1) Financial aid to China; (2) Do not supply Japan with military supplies; (3) Restrict imports of Japanese goods; (4) Establish an adjustment committee to handle the above matters and other sanctions against Japan; (5) Establish a committee to investigate the truth of Japan's indiscriminate bombing of Chinese civilians.

These five points are the responsibility of all democratic and peaceful countries today, and they are also within their power to do. In order to protect China's territorial sovereignty and also for the safety of democratic and peaceful countries themselves.

We certainly cannot have any extravagant hopes for the current League of Nations, and the League of Nations' prestige among people around the world is declining daily. However, the League of Nations is still the only existing international organization that upholds League of Nations justice and peaceful order. Passing all appeals through the League of Nations is naturally easier for democratic and peaceful countries and people of peace and justice around the world to accept and implement.

Therefore, although we dare not agree with those so-called League of Nations liaison theorists who rely on the League of Nations, we must also point out all arguments that excessively underestimate or even curse the League of Nations. We should warmly support Representative Wellington Koo's presentation of five demands and his impassioned speech.

According to a Geneva dispatch, the League of Nations Administrative Council met on the 23rd to draft a resolution in response to Representative Koo's proposal, which will reaffirm the League of Nations' urging of member states to provide practical assistance to our country's war of resistance. This kind of resolution is within our expectations! We should not only point out that those pessimistic arguments and curses of the League of Nations are unfounded, but also respectfully salute the representatives of the four countries on the drafting committee: Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Latvia.

In the future, we should further base ourselves on this resolution and the five points raised by Representative Koo to demand that people from all countries, public opinion circles from all over the world, and governments of all countries earnestly and conscientiously implement them! We must expand international publicity with the facts of our internal close cooperation to promote political development, strengthen the economy, and persist in the war of resistance in order to win more and greater foreign friends.

### Wang Jingwei and His Wife Fly to Japan

On the 23rd, the Central News Agency published news about Wang Jingwei and Chen Bijun flying to Japan on the 5th of this month. This news of Wang × going to Japan, which had been widely circulated in newspapers everywhere a few days earlier, can be mutually verified. We can see even more clearly what the background of all of Wang's remarks is - there were still a few people who trusted and cherished Wang too much in the past, hoping day and night that Wang would ultimately not disappoint the expectations of the people of the country, and even tried to explain Wang's remarks from a good perspective, but now they should also sigh and say that the words of the ancient sages were not wrong: "Now, in my dealings with men, I hear their words and observe their actions"! In fact, in his remarks, where did he not reveal his true colors!

From the news announced by the Central News Agency, we can also see that there is a rumor that Chen Gongbo does not approve of Wang's actions and intends to sever his relationship with Wang. Before there are facts to prove it, we certainly cannot make a hasty judgment, but Wang's actions not only violate the major plans of the party and the country and harm the national people, but also greatly violate "Chinese morality." Among those who usually plot and follow Wang, are there few wise men who cherish themselves? Can they also slightly sense the Central Government's months of seeking opinions and the final expectations of the entire people and return to the right path?

Japanese × harassment of China has encountered new and insurmountable difficulties. The recent sharp drop in the Japanese currency also shows one aspect of this. They are now trying to step up the robbery and oppression of the occupied territories, and to achieve this, the first step is to establish a more powerful puppet regime. Therefore, Wang is still the most appropriate tool for the Japanese × today. Everyone should carefully monitor Wang's future activities!

### Two × Warships Forcibly Board a British Shipping Vessel South of Waglan Island and Carry Out Harassment; Firing Shots as a Threat, Ordering the Ranpura to Stop Sailing; British Warships and Seaplanes Rush to the Rescue and Drive Them Away; British Commander Witnesses the Incident on Board: Will File a Serious Protest

The British India Steam Navigation Company's Ranpura arrived from Singapore and sailed to the sea off Waglan Island yesterday morning at 8:00 AM. Suddenly, it encountered one × cruiser and one destroyer, flying flags to stop its progress. Later, troops were sent to board the ship and carry out harassment. Later, the Hong Kong Naval Commander received a telegram from the ship and immediately dispatched aircraft and warships to the rescue, and the incident ended. It is found that × forces have been ambushing and harassing neutral ships in and out of Hong Kong's territorial waters, and robbing them under various pretexts, countless times. The number of merchant ships that have been robbed is countless, and the Ranpura is the first of the large ocean liners traveling between Europe and the Far East to be harassed by × warships. The details obtained after boarding the Ranpura upon its arrival in Hong Kong are as follows:

Commanders Maby and Beattie Accompany the Ship to Hong Kong

The Ranpura is a 16,688-ton ocean liner, one of the largest ships under the British India Steam Navigation Company's fleet on the Europe-Far East route. It departed from Singapore yesterday and was carrying Rear Admiral Lyster, the newly appointed Fifth Fleet Commander in the Far East, and Beattie, the newly appointed Hong Kong Naval Commander, who jointly boarded the ship to Hong Kong. Lyster's mission on this trip is to assist Admiral Noble, the British Commander-in-Chief in the Far East, in managing the British fleet in China. Beattie is coming to Hong Kong to take over as Hong Kong Naval Commander, as the current Commander Daker is about to complete his term. Therefore, both men witnessed everything on board the Ranpura yesterday when it was searched.

Encountered × Warships South of Waglan Island

At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the Ranpura was sailing in the sea four nautical miles south of Waglan Island, one mile outside Hong Kong's territorial waters. It was about to display its flag to report the lighthouse on the island and then sail past. Suddenly, one × destroyer came face to face and flew its flag to stop its progress. Next to the destroyer was one × cruiser, flying the flag of a rear admiral. For safety reasons, the ship immediately obeyed the order to stop and sent an urgent telegram to Hong Kong to report the incident to the Hong Kong Navy. The × warship sent a motorboat with three naval officers and one signalman to the Ranpura. They rushed on board and went straight to the shipmaster's cabin. One of the officers asked the shipmaster if it was a British merchant ship, where it was sailing, where it came from, and what kind of cargo it was carrying, and forced him to show the ship's registration papers. The shipmaster refused due to the unreasonable inspection.

Three British Warships Ordered to Sail to the Rescue

While the × warship was carrying out harassment, the Hong Kong Navy had already received the ship's telegram and immediately ordered three warships, including HMS Duchess, which were nearby on exercises, to sail to the scene to assist. At the same time, a British seaplane that was practicing in the airspace above Lei Yue Mun also saw the Ranpura being forced to stop and knew that an accident had occurred. It immediately flew forward and circled the Ranpura once, flying low to inspect the × warship. Knowing that Hong Kong had sent aircraft and warships to assist, it did not dare to linger and immediately hoisted its flag, ordering the four × officers and soldiers who had boarded the ship to leave quickly. The × soldiers harassed the ship for about half an hour before leaving. The Ranpura also set sail and returned to Hong Kong at 8:45 AM, traveling at a speed of 24 knots per hour. It arrived in Hong Kong at 10:00 AM yesterday morning and berthed at the Kowloon Wharf.

All Crew Members on Board Expressed Anger

When reporters boarded the ship yesterday to investigate, the crew members on board all expressed their anger at the Ranpura's search. They told reporters that the incident was as described above, and said that the flag hoisted by the × warship was a warning signal, indicating that if the ship did not stop, it would fire its guns. At the same time, it fired a shot as a warning. The shipmaster paid attention to the flag it was flying and ordered the ship to stop for safety reasons. The name of the × warship that intercepted and searched the ship this time was not noted. After the incident, when the ship was about to return to Hong Kong, the three British warships that had been sent to assist had already arrived like flying, and the warning flags were flying on the warships, ordering the × army to immediately leave the ship. Therefore, the × warship hurriedly signaled, and after the × soldiers left the ship, they were escorted back to Hong Kong by the three warships. Fortunately, there were no other losses in this incident, and the passengers on board were very calm.

Two Warning Shots Fired; Bullets Flew Past the Ship

According to a passenger, when the incident occurred, many passengers were on deck preparing to eat breakfast. Suddenly, they saw a Japanese warship two stars away from the ship. When it was about one mile away, the Japanese warship hoisted its flag, ordering the ship to stop. After the ship traveled about half a mile, the Japanese warship suddenly fired two shots, the bullets flew past the ship, and then it blew its horn, ordering it to stop. The ship then stopped about 400 yards away from the warship. Soon, Japanese soldiers were seen boarding the ship on a motorboat. The Japanese soldiers were on the ship for about 20 minutes. A British seaplane arrived in the air and flew low to scout. Before long, the Japanese soldiers left the ship and returned to the warship.

### Hong Kong Air Force Plane Crashes into the Sea; All Three Pilots Luckily Rescued

Yesterday's Hong Kong Telegraph reported that an Air Force plane was piloted by Mr. Howes a few days ago, with two airmen on board, namely a Mr. Taff and a Mr. Bruss, when flying from overseas to Hong Kong, suddenly broke down and was forced to descend and crashed into the sea. The three men hurried out and climbed onto the plane's wings and were soon rescued. As for whether the plane has sunk, the Air Force authorities are still silent.

### Dongguan-Hong Kong Cargo Boat Robbed by Pirates; Police Solve Case and Arrest Four Suspects After Two Months

On March 27th of this year, a cargo boat was robbed by a large vessel in the waters of Wanqing Sha outside Hong Kong. The people on board were forced ashore and the boat was seized. After receiving the news, the Hong Kong police immediately launched a search and finally recovered the boat the night before last. At the same time, four suspected men were arrested on board.

Wanqing Sha Waters: Sudden Encounter with Pirate Boat

Guo Jindi (45 years old), the owner of cargo boat No. 3425, reported to the police station that on March 22nd of this year, she was hired to sail from Zhongyuan Village in Dongguan to Hong Kong. The boat was loaded with 280 bundles of water hyacinth, worth over 1,900 silver dollars, as well as a coffin and two boatmen. The journey was smooth until about 3 p.m. on March 27th, when a fishing boat weighing 1,000 dan suddenly appeared in the waters of Wanqing Sha. Guo, suspecting it was up to no good, intended to sail away, but realizing they were in the vast ocean with no escape, she pretended to be calm. When the pirate boat was close enough, it forced them to stop.

Submissive Boat Owner: Cargo Boat Seized

Guo, realizing she was in a dangerous situation, outnumbered by the pirates, dared not resist and allowed them to do as they pleased. There were six pirates on the boat, all armed with guns and very fierce. Four pirates jumped onto her boat, threatened everyone with their guns, and forced her to sail the boat close to the shore near Wanqing Sha. They drove everyone ashore and then seized the boat, sailing towards British territory. After being forced ashore, Guo and the others tried to get to Hong Kong as quickly as possible and reported the incident to the police station. After receiving the report, the police immediately sent water police patrol boats to search the coast. However, the pirates appeared and disappeared unpredictably. Despite the authorities' efforts for a long time, they were unable to capture the bandits.

Pirate Gang Smashed: Four Arrested

The night before last, the police sent out a large team of detectives to search. As a result, they found a suspicious cargo boat in the Yau Ma Tei typhoon shelter. Upon investigation, they confirmed that it was the same boat reported by Guo Jindi. At the same time, there were suspicious men on board who were arrested. In addition, a certain water police patrol boat was patrolling the sea the night before last and found a certain cargo boat adrift on the sea, with no one on board. The boat was loaded with grass mats and other items. The water police boat towed it back to Hong Kong and reported the case. Whether the boat was robbed, or the people on board were murdered or engaged in smuggling, is still unknown. The authorities are currently conducting a secret investigation.

### Hong Kong Market: The Japanese Yen Even Worse

The collapse of the Japanese yen is even more evident in the Hong Kong market. The reporter inquired at three money exchange counters in the city center about buying yen. The first quoted 51 cents of Hong Kong silver per yen, the second quoted 54 cents, and the third quoted 58 cents. The first quote (which means the yen is worth only half its face value) stated that they had a large amount of Japanese currency in stock. The official price of the Bank of Taiwan in Hong Kong is 94 cents. The degree to which the yen's price has fallen in the "black market" is even greater in Hong Kong than in Shanghai.

### Financial Commentary: Exposing the Japanese, Who Suffer the Consequences of Counterfeit Currency

The Japanese have been invading China for two years, and their troops are mired and exhausted. To make a final struggle, they have launched so-called economic and currency wars. For example, after the failure of the puppet Joint Reserve Bank in North China, they ignited the "star" of the puppet China Development Bank in Shanghai, which is one aspect of their desperate measures. The Japanese have repeatedly declared that the banknotes of this puppet bank will engage in a final duel with our legal tender. Regardless of how sinister their intentions may be, all knowledgeable people, both Chinese and foreign, sneer at it and believe that it will inevitably fail. As expected, the bank had not even been established for a month before the counterfeit currency was severely damaged as soon as it appeared, with its market price only 66% of the legal tender. Even the Japanese yen, which was considered the only support, also plummeted and crashed, falling by eight pence. It can be said that hurting others is hurting oneself. However, this matter is only just beginning and will inevitably become worse in the future. According to the "Financial Review Monthly," the fate of this bank and its counterfeit currency will be the same as that of the puppet Joint Reserve Bank in North China (see the article "New Conspiracy of Japan to Destroy Legal Tender" by Shi Yiwenzhi in the June issue of the journal). The article's arguments are precise, its analysis is detailed, its exposure of hidden facts is thorough, and its insights are profound. Therefore, it can hit the nail on the head and leave them with nowhere to hide. The journal has translated many articles by Japanese writers such as Kimura Matsuoka Yamazaki on the Sino-Japanese currency war, which can be compared and viewed, and the more you look at it, the more you will see the embarrassing situation of their painstaking efforts being in vain. In addition, there are papers by Jia Shiyi, Wu Gan, Yao Qingsan, Wei Youfei, etc., which are all related to wartime finance and economics and are of great value. They are now published in Hong Kong and are available at major bookstores.

### Abandoning the Pen for the Sword: China Amateur School Sends Off Enlistees Yesterday

### Children's Welfare Association Holds Costume Carnival Yesterday; Madam Soong Ching-ling Presides Over Lottery; Mrs. Vibart Lectures on the History of Clothing

The costume carnival organized by the China Wartime Children's Welfare Association was held for the first time yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. on the open space to the left of the Peninsula Hotel. The weather was clear and sunny, and the sun was scorching, but Chinese and Western ladies and gentlemen led children to participate in the event in an endless stream. Vehicles came and went in front of the door, as dense as weaving. It is estimated that more than a thousand people attended the event that day, with a total income of about two thousand dollars. The entire venue was covered with bamboo mats, and the construction cost was paid by Yang Yongkang. To the left and right of the entrance, there were more than a dozen game rooms, including coconut throwing, darts, ladder climbing, wooden horses, human-headed fish, pot throwing, fishing pond, small zoo, bear man, ring throwing, and toy soldiers. In the center was a music stage, and the outer perimeter was a race track. The costume performance room was in the stone corner of the venue, and the refreshment area was next to it. The children who attended the event that day were very happy to participate in the games, especially the horse riding and slide sections, which were the most lively. Because of the hot weather, the guests were very thirsty, and the two tea and water stations had a lot of customers. At 3:30 p.m., the costume performance began to enter. The admission fee was one or two dimes. Government lawyer Abbott personally came to the venue to welcome everyone, and his wife gave a lecture in English on the history of various costumes in the venue, which was very informative. The Chinese interpretation was provided by Dr. He Ailing. Those who entered to watch were packed like sardines, and those who arrived later could not get in. At 5:30 p.m., the lottery draw was held, presided over by Madam Soong Ching-ling and the wife of a musical nobleman. The results of the draw are as follows: first prize of the 50-cent lottery ticket, 935, a wristwatch; (2) 302, a camera; (3) 918, a large doll; (4) 480; (5) 934; prizes for the 20-cent lottery ticket: (1) 912, a children's bicycle; (2) 219, a doll bed; (3) 25, a bottle of water; (4) 100; (5) 230; entrance ticket prize: 357, two entertainment tickets; order award: 63, two after-theater tickets.

### [Comic Strip] On the Streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon

— Yu Wan

The Lower Class Society… Their Spiritual Food is in Short Supply

It is the streets of early summer. When the hard-working masses are suffocated in buildings crowded with twenty or thirty people on each floor, after dinner, the sound of wooden clogs on the streets, although not drowning out the noise of cars and motorcycles, the city's movement is at its most intense at this time of early evening. Sheung Wan, Central, up and down the mountain, New Territories Kowloon, coming and going, are they not all shiny cars? However, the hard-working masses under their control, they drag their wooden clogs, baring their chests, they do not have the fortune to throw money around. They roam the streets. Apart from drinking two cents worth of "cool tea", they have to go near the wall to read "comic strips".

In a corner of oblique sunlight, or in front of a grocery store, you will see a wooden frame three to five feet high, a few empty milk cartons. Some of the wooden frames may be filled with "complete" sets, while others may just have the book cover. The milk carton is full of books, one after another. The cover, although without a design of patterns, the colors are considered complex - yellow and green: Liang Shanbo Zhu Yingtai, Purple Sand Cup, Tianqi Accusation, Burning Hongyun Temple, Wu Song Fighting the Tiger, Tang Seng Taking the Scriptures, Seven Heroes and Thirteen Knights, Jiang Taigong Met King Wen at Eighty, Ma Jiepu, Bao Gong's Strange Cases, Jade-Faced Fox... The more modern ones include Beauty Replacing the Country, Diao Chan, Zhong Wuyan, Sixty Years Later in Shanghai, Chu Overlord, A Mu Lin... The so-called modernity is perhaps related to the most recent movies - to put it beautifully, these hundreds of books are almost street miniature picture galleries. They set up ten or so small wooden benches less than five inches high and a foot long. The seats are often full. Regardless of men, women, old, or young, even those who are illiterate, they lie back, squatting, flipping through page after page. After dusk, although the number of readers is slightly less, there are still many who are focused and engrossed, chasing after volume after volume, upper and lower volumes.

Gas lights illuminated the audience of the entire book stall - from their eyebrows, they showed an attitude of "upholding justice", from their lip smacking, they showed a smile of "divine couple"! "Bitterness ends and sweetness comes", "vengeance for grievances", they were experiencing it. They have struggled half their lives in capitalist exploitation, they have worked hard with their hands and feet, they still dream of "bitterness ends and sweetness comes" - they may want to resist fate, but they fear the arrival of "retribution".

The people who browse through comic books, especially the children who are immersed in it. In the morning, adults have to work, and the children are the world in front of the small bookstore - about six or seven in the morning! What you see may be all children aged eight or nine to fifteen or sixteen, including primary school students, packed together like ants. The short stools are not enough, the wooden boxes, and even the schoolbags are full. One cent to rent four books, one cent to rent eight books, the newly released ones (actually, newly arrived ones) are two cents each. They take the string from their mother's pocket and hand it over like a tax. Primary school students, they will also have money for fruit, bait, pens, and ink to come and see these fascinating books.

Last year, news came from Hong Kong that three young men, aged twelve or thirteen, secretly left their lovely home and agreed to seek immortality. As a result, they climbed the mountain in vain and first plucked up the courage to walk through the tunnel of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway... Later, they were finally discovered by their families and stopped. This was a gift from "Seven Swords and Thirteen Knights" - they have the spirit of Robinson Crusoe, but they lack the training of Boy Scouts. What they usually come into contact with are bizarre and exaggerated comic books!

A few years ago, some people launched an initiative to improve comic books, and quite a few have already been published. Unfortunately, what you see in the market is still as rare as morning stars after a few years! The ghosts and monsters in comic books in the streets and alleys are still filling the streets! Intellectuals in the War of Resistance should all stand firm in their positions! We must not only improve these feudal, outdated comic books, but also find a way to make them compatible with the "War of Resistance" - there are some, such as "Popular Readings" published by the Popular Readings Publishing House, and "Continuous Stories" published by the Popular Art Publishing House; however, it's like a cup of water trying to put out a burning cart of wood, how can it help? It is said that the catalog of comic books on the streets exceeds ten thousand titles, even if it is five thousand titles, its penetration into people's hearts is no different from floods and fierce beasts!

The masses in the corner are in urgent need of education. The children on the short stools are a new foundation for the nation's life! However, under the gas lamp, in the shadow of dawn, what we see is ultimately a group that is being misled!

### Dedication

— Wang Ying

We feel indescribably happy to be able to meet you all in Hong Kong today.

For the past two years, we have traveled through many cities and villages in our homeland amidst the flames of war. Every day, we lived with countless heroic brothers and the struggling masses amidst bombing and Japanese artillery fire. If our work is to educate soldiers and the people, it is better to say that the people and the heroic soldiers are educating us.

After working in the war for 20 months, we felt our own weakness and always wanted to contribute more to our country, so we made the decision to promote our cause abroad.

Now, because we are passing through Hong Kong, we have the opportunity to put on the stage some of the plays we brought back from the battlefield. In terms of stage technology, we are still children learning to walk and eagerly waiting for guidance from the audience in Hong Kong, so that we can learn more. We will use flat ground, high mountains, trenches, and wheat fields as temporary stages in the front line to perform these plays, and millions of brave soldiers will be our dearest audience. They pour all their energy into carefully listening to the words of the characters in the play. At that time, the earth was extremely quiet, and we felt a kind of spiritual communication. When Japanese planes came, everyone would lie down together. After the Japanese planes left, we continued our play. Once, in Shangcheng, Henan, we performed "When the Bastards are Gone!", which was mainly about military-civilian cooperation, to entertain a division of General Shang Zhian's troops who were about to go to the front line. The brothers were all sitting neatly on the ground in a large open square. Halfway through the play, it suddenly started to rain heavily. At that time, we discussed with an officer of the division that in order to prevent the brothers from getting wet, we were willing to walk 30 miles to the barracks to perform again tomorrow. The officer stood on the high ground and asked, "Comrades of the National Salvation Drama Troupe, because you are afraid that our brothers will get wet in the rain, you are willing to go to our barracks to perform again tomorrow, are you going back now?" "No!" This was the loud reply from the brothers. "We will keep watching!" It was the second loud shout. We were moved by this sound, and everyone did their best to perform on stage. The brothers had no rain gear, and they watched the two-hour play in the heavy rain without moving. When they returned in an orderly line, they sang the song "Compatriots are being slaughtered, and our land is being forcibly occupied!" This song moved us to tears and made us feel that our work enthusiasm and efforts were not enough. In some poor and remote inland areas, when those simple and innocent farmers, regardless of men, women, old, or young, loved us so much, we felt that we had never been loved by the audience so much. In the Dabie Mountains, the farmers came to see our plays from 40 or 50 miles away, supporting the old and young, and carrying rice. After watching the play, they would cook and eat next to the stage, and sleep under the wooden stage the next day to continue watching. They often expressed their enthusiasm for us with a few bowls of coarse tea and a few eggs. We felt that these were more precious than anything else, and they could give us encouragement and comfort.

There were several times when we almost sacrificed ourselves in Japanese bombing raids. In Xuzhou, especially in Songbu, the target of the Japanese planes was only a few meters away from the stage. As a result, a brave theater worker was sacrificed, and one of our group was injured, but we continued to perform shortly afterward.

We will soon be going abroad to work. We will extend our hands to those millions of overseas Chinese whose hearts are linked to the motherland and tell them that the motherland is fighting - fighting to the end, victory is ours.

During our short stay in Hong Kong, we are very happy to have an opportunity to raise funds for the Hong Kong All-Sector Disaster Relief Association and do our best to help the wounded soldiers and refugees. At the same time, I still believe that the audience in Hong Kong will definitely give us great encouragement.

Many people from the cultural and theater circles have given us a lot of encouragement and guidance in our work. I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to them here.

At a discussion meeting of the China National Salvation Drama Troupe, I met this group of battle-hardened theater soldiers. In their nearly two years of arduous work of exile and relocation, I did not meet them in the front line, nor did I meet them in the rear. I only met them when they were passing through this comfortable Hong Kong on their way to promote their cause abroad, and when I had not achieved any results in my work. Under such circumstances, Mr. Jinshan still wanted to express his respect to the workers who stayed in Hong Kong on behalf of the National Salvation Drama Troupe, and the chairman also hoped that I could say something. At that time, it was like a sharp thorn suddenly pierced into my back. A feeling of extreme shame made me unable to suppress the increased beating of my heart and the rapid breathing, and I almost became mute. I felt that apart from listening to the lessons, all my words could not be said, and there was no need to say them again. This thorn has been staying on my back. Only by increasing my pace and intensifying my work, maybe there is hope of removing it; otherwise, if I abandon my responsibility and fail, then it will always remain on my back, piercing straight into my heart and becoming an "incurable" "terminal illness"!

If I still have the courage to say something, I can only shout: Long live the liberation and freedom of the Chinese nation! Long live the fighting spirit of the China National Salvation Drama Troupe! But I will no longer shout "Long live the China National Salvation Drama Troupe" because our fight is certainly continuous, but I firmly believe that the final victory is in sight. At that time, we will fight to build a new China, not to "save the country."

Raising my voice from the busy and overwhelming work that makes people excited and also overly tired, it is really difficult to say what is most appropriate. I only hope that the coming out of "China Relief" can let the compatriots in Hong Kong know more about the unbearability of the "thorn", and pay more attention to the disasters of the motherland. Take on some responsibilities, and only by taking the fighting spirit of "China Relief" as our spirit, can we not let down being a good son or daughter of China!

Finally, let me shout out loud again:

Long live the fighting spirit of "China Relief"!

### Long Live the Nation! Long Live the Chinese Salvation! A Performance in Hong Kong Dedicated to the Chinese Salvation

— Hu Chunbing

Immediately after the Hong Kong theatrical community jointly performed "Huanghuagang," before the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe had the chance to go abroad, they staged "Long Live the Nation," "Defend the Motherland," and "Spring in Taierzhuang" to raise funds for the Hong Kong All-Circles Relief Federation to aid wounded soldiers and refugees. This signifies that theatrical work is enriching the united front, aligning its efforts with the demands of the war of resistance and serving the victory of national liberation—the theatrical work serving the war of resistance is expanding and deepening daily.

The comrades of the Chinese Salvation have long recognized and established a glorious tradition in the quantity of their plays. Since August 13th, they have undertaken a Long March of over ten thousand miles, educating the masses while learning from them. Abandoning the previous performance methods in large cities, they used their knowledge of drama and technical mastery to imbue the living, bloody reality with new forms through collective and correct understanding, organically making it an inseparable and indispensable part of the war of resistance. This work experience has forged them into a team of iron and steel, and it is also this work experience that makes them worthy of the admiration and learning of general drama workers.

The plays staged by the Chinese Salvation this time are for urban audiences. Not only has the content selected been the most quintessential works, but also technically, they are enough to make the general audience, who do not yet understand drama, extremely fond of it, and even become supporters of anti-Japanese war drama. Therefore, this performance not only strengthens the propaganda of the war of resistance and serves wounded soldiers and refugees but also expands the realm of dramatic effect and influence, making more people concretely and deeply aware that national salvation is the responsibility of every Chinese person.

In the work experience of the Chinese Salvation, there are many aspects that the theatrical community staying in Hong Kong can refer to and learn from: a serious life, continuous self-education, hard work, and the spirit of struggle to dedicate all efforts to the establishment of a new China!

### Expectations from Gold Mountain

— Luo Qiu

The era is advancing like a rushing river. The alarm bells of the times are ringing loudly in our ears. This era does not tolerate "corruption" because "corruption" will hinder the progress of the times. China today has come to a great era of revival, and at the same time, it is also a dangerous and terrible era. However, we will not allow China to sink. On the contrary, we will do our utmost to support and aid the glorious final victory of the motherland. We, the drama creators, should dedicate ourselves to the extensive promotion and development of anti-Japanese war drama with loyalty and purity.

As a new force in anti-Japanese war drama—the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe—we anticipate them as we anticipate the victory of the war of resistance. Everyone knows that this new force comes from the mainland. The head of the troupe is Mr. Jinshan, the deputy head is Ms. Wang Ying, and there is also a military expert, Mr. Lin Shu.

Mr. Jinshan's first statement was, "The Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe's arrival overseas is to fully introduce the numerous facts of the war of resistance within the country to overseas Chinese, to make them realize that the war of resistance will surely be victorious and that China definitely has a way." Therefore, the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe conducts very strict and serious training for every script and every role. After each play is performed, they invite General Lin Shu to provide a detailed and thorough systematic explanation of the military and political situation of the war of resistance. At the same time, they screen war of resistance films and exhibit war of resistance photos. Mr. Jinshan explained this fiery enthusiasm passionately to everyone at several receptions.

Mr. Jinshan's second statement was, "We are like cultural sentries. After we go abroad, there will be many situations. We hope that cultural comrades in the mainland and Hong Kong will support us and give us more guidance." Yes, the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe is not only a cultural sentry but also goes beyond being a sentry. We call them cultural vanguards. We hope that they will win victories in the front lines. First, our drama must develop and expand abroad; second, our overseas Chinese must know more about the motherland and donate more money. ××××××, we will continue until the final victory. We respect Mr. Jinshan's humility and courtesy. We cannot express enough how we wish to be in Hong Kong and never forget the good news of the Salvation Drama Troupe.

Mr. Jinshan's third statement was, "We will go to Nanyang first, then Singapore, and then the Americas. We hope to constantly hear news of victory along the way." Mr. Jinshan strives on one hand and thinks about the motherland on the other. Although his body is overseas, his heart is with the motherland. This spirit of fighting and love for the motherland will make those who run away, surrender, and ×××××××××× die of shame! Mr. Jinshan is striving to advance. The motherland will surely win, and the motherland will surely rise from the arduous struggle!

The Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe led by Mr. Jinshan is about to perform in Hong Kong. In addition to introducing them to the overseas Chinese, we recommend them to the people of Hong Kong. If you want to watch plays, go to the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe. This is a truly authentic art, not a commercial one, and it is permeated with the issue of war resistance and is 100% based on facts.

### "Chinese Salvation" on the Theatrical Front

— Ming Xi

Overcoming difficulties requires strong perseverance. What creates this strong perseverance is an upward, optimistic, and non-disappointing spirit. This spirit comes from our unbreakable confidence, which is "China will not perish" and "Final victory will surely belong to us." For twenty months, the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe has overcome all difficulties, learning in the war of resistance, training in the war of resistance, growing and strengthening in the war of resistance, and at the same time, enabling their weapon—drama—to exert its greatest effectiveness in the work of national salvation. This can be said to be mutually causal.

The Japanese are plotting against us in every possible way, leaving no stone unturned. If we were to have a complete reckoning with the Japanese, and if this war of resistance is of course the time for that reckoning, then the people who carry out this reckoning work cannot be done by simple, scattered organizations alone. And the widespread performance of drama cannot exert its great effect in the same way as urban performances in the past. A disciplined organization is necessary to complete the expected tasks. We can still remember that after "August 13th," several salvation drama troupes set off one after another. How many still exist alone? I am not saying that those non-existent groups have lost their fighting power, but I am indicating that the continued existence of this Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe, which has evolved from the salvation drama troupe, and its ability to gradually grow up is not accidental, but inevitable.

The old urban drama groups were always inevitably scattered and short-lived, and the individual's life inevitably became accustomed to the romance of artists, and even the idea of showing off and dabbling was mixed in. Those groups or individuals who are still struggling on the drama front are absolutely unacceptable, and there is naturally no possibility of their existence. Although they are not completely the same as the army, they are at least similar—strict organization, disciplined life, harmonious emotions, and deep understanding. The old things are not enough to cope with the environment, and new things will continue to be learned. This infinite experience is the gunpowder storehouse of the essence of the war of attrition. "Chinese Salvation" is fighting on one side and continuing to enrich their gunpowder storehouse on the other side. The gunpowder of experience is not consumed but only grows.

What I saw in the workers of Chinese Salvation was simplicity and robustness. What I heard in their conversations was sincerity and richness of experience. What I know about their organization and life, the plays I am about to see, I will gain infinite impressions, infinite satisfactory impressions, and indelible impressions. But we cannot forget that this performance by "Chinese Salvation" is a preparation for their overseas propaganda, and they are using a new strategy according to the time and place. The few thousand dollars spent on scenery and costumes is not a waste. They want to make full use of it to achieve the expected effect. Performing drama in the countryside and performing in the city are different. In other words, performing in the countryside cannot be used in urban drama anymore. However, working for the goal of "national salvation" is consistent.

Living and working in hardship, difficulty, danger, and hardship, under siege, is not only fighting with the Japanese, but also fighting with these hardships. Chinese Salvation, which has been established for twenty months, has won. They have not received any reward, but, really, have they not? Yes, the freedom of the motherland and the freedom of 450 million compatriots will be the reward received by everyone working on the front line.

### What I Saw During Rehearsals

— Lin Shu

What is placed before the audience is the brutal behavior of the Japanese that is utterly inhumane: it is the resistance movement of the sons and daughters of China that moves heaven and earth and makes ghosts and gods weep. On one hand, it expresses the destruction of the world, and on the other hand, it expresses the dawn of humanity. Two absolutely opposite forces are fighting. I want to weep for the dead compatriots, but I absolutely refuse to weep. I would rather shed blood several more times and sweep away these demons together. This is my feeling after seeing the Battle of Taierzhuang once.

An individual's strength is ultimately limited; using an individual's strength within a group will produce a great effect. Wei Dapeng, even though he is a hero, inevitably has to rely on the strength of the masses to survive and to breathe a sigh of relief for the country and the nation. This is an impression from our rehearsal of Long Live the Nation.

Young people are really lovely. Their blood is so hot, their hearts are so frank, and their national concepts and national consciousness are so strong. Since I joined the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe, I have seen all the comrades staying up all night, sometimes not even eating their meals, desperately preparing for this performance, which makes me feel ashamed. Our bloodshed once or twice on the front line is absolutely incomparable to their contribution of sweating everywhere at all times. Although I do not have their theatrical talent, I also have to wave the flag and cheer, and serve as a foot soldier.

### Introduction to Several Great Famous Plays Performed by the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe

For ten months, the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe has been travelling through the northern and southern battlefields, moving millions of soldiers and civilians. Now, they are going abroad to promote their cause in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong All-Circles Relief Federation, out of admiration for the troupe's national defense art and fundraising to help refugees and soldiers, has specially invited them to hold a large-scale charity performance, which will start tonight (the 25th) at the Lee Theatre for three consecutive nights.

The three plays staged by the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe this time include two five-act plays and four one-act plays. The two five-act plays are "Long Live the Nation" and "Spring in Taierzhuang." The four one-act plays are "Thief," "Seeking Life from Death," "Ghosts Weeping in the Night," and "Escaping to Hong Kong." Because these four plays are a series of anti-Japanese stories, they have also been combined into a single play title, "Defend the Motherland."

"Long Live the Nation" is based on the self-defense struggle of the people in Northeast China. The atrocities of the Japanese in Northeast China aroused widespread indignation, so an uprising was held on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival, annihilating the tyrannical rebels overnight and avenging the pain of national and familial destruction. This is a five-act play with many complex plots interspersed in the middle: the daughter of a traitor, inciting the puppet army to revolt; peasant leaders deliberating late at night and swearing an oath of alliance with blood. This is a story with very profound significance that educates us on practical struggle experience.

"Spring in Taierzhuang" is a true record of the bloody battle in southern Shandong, completely based on history. The true historical value of this battle is already well known, so there is no need to explain it further. What we hope for is how we should learn from this great spirit and continue the war of resistance. This fully demonstrates the close cooperation between the army and the people, and a noble spirit of heroism in defending the country, which deeply moves us.

Since the war of resistance, there have been too many exciting stories, and "Defend the Motherland" is a refined compilation of these stories. "Thief" is a satirical drama; "Seeking Life from Death" tells the story of a fair and honest gentleman who killed his own beloved son in order to protect the secrets of the guerrillas, but an insidious secret service was eventually annihilated by his wisdom. "Ghosts Weeping in the Night" depicts the tragic cruelty of the Japanese bombing, which blurs the line between humans and ghosts among the people. "Escaping to Hong Kong" tells the story of a father and daughter who fled from Northeast China, but they took the wrong path, and they almost forgot who was whipping and tormenting their lives. Fortunately, they later received guidance, ×××××××××××, which led them back to the path of light. These four one-act plays, although they do not have a consistent plot, have a common feature, which is the sparks of blood and flesh that erupt in the war of resistance!

### Learn from "Chinese Salvation"!

— Lang Pan

The Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe was born in the torrent of the war of resistance, traveling to the front lines, the rear areas, and overseas, serving the protracted war of resistance. It is not only a cultural vanguard in the Chinese national liberation movement, but also an educator and organizer of soldiers and civilians in the people's revolutionary struggle. At the same time, it also plays an exemplary leading role in all salvation drama troupes and cultural groups across the country. This is a publicly recognized fact in the cultural sector.

It has been almost two months since the Chinese Salvation Drama Troupe came to Hong Kong from the mainland. They have left a fairly deep impression on people from all walks of life residing in Hong Kong. They should naturally leave an even deeper impression on the cultural and theatrical circles in Hong Kong and many groups engaged in salvation work. Now, "Chinese Salvation" is holding a large-scale charity performance starting on the 25th to raise funds for the Hong Kong All-Circles Relief Federation to help wounded soldiers and refugees. After the charity performance, they will go to Nanyang and even embark on a more distant journey. In addition to helping this great performance with respect and enthusiasm, silently wishing it success, and maintaining contact with it in future endeavors, we in Hong Kong's cultural and theatrical circles and all patriotic groups should personally feel that the organizational life and working methods of "Chinese Salvation," and the experience and lessons of Chinese Salvation over the past twenty-odd months, deserve our serious study. The following points, at least, should be particularly important:

First of all, in terms of organization, "Chinese Salvation" is a group filled with the spirit of democracy, with the general assembly as the highest authority, held once a week; the executive committee is the executive body, also held once a week. In this way, a group can be like a harmonious family or even like a body. Although it is more difficult for groups with more members to achieve this, if every member of this group seriously regards the group to which they belong as their own family and body, and strives to correct the errors of their superiors and members, and seeks to realize the spirit of democracy, then this group will definitely be able to develop healthily!

Secondly, "Chinese Salvation" is also a model group that can best use the principle of division of labor and cooperation and truly practice talentism. From the head of the group, Jinshan, the deputy head Wang Ying, the director of the drama department Liu Danqing, the director of propaganda Wu He, to Lin Shu, Fan Zheng, and other members, all are talented people, some drafting and writing articles, some making scenery and props, and some producing films. Although there are differences in organization and name, they can generally eliminate class concepts and realize the principle of "everyone has something to do." At present, there are still a few who do not have very good organization and work, but in fact, the upper and lower levels distrust each other, and they are fragmented. This not only makes the whole group become a formality, but also provides opportunities for a few ambitious people and gangsters to manipulate and exploit it. Therefore, I sincerely hope that all groups can learn from "Chinese Salvation," eliminate all party and factional prejudices, truly respect talents, practice division of labor and cooperation, and only seek to develop the group, without paying too much attention to the small gains and losses and honor and disgrace of the individual.

Thirdly, "Chinese Salvation" is also a group that can fully express the spirit of "unity, liveliness, tension, and seriousness." They have a three-chapter agreement, namely (1) only collective action, no individual action, sharing life and death, joys and sorrows; (2) all internal and external affairs are absolutely open; (3) refusing all public and private banquets unrelated to work, and there are also four "maxims," namely "work tension, life seriousness, economy clear, attitude pure." In addition, in fact, the members of the group can truly help each other in the same boat, helping each other and yielding to each other. Daily life is even closer than brothers and sisters. All of these are worthy of serious study by all salvation groups.

Fourthly, the daily life of each member of "Chinese Salvation" is also worthy of special study. They hold a morning meeting every morning from 7:00 to 7:30, with the content including current affairs reports, reading reports, life reviews, and work arrangements, etc. After the morning meeting is the time for reading and holding group discussions. Noon is for office work and rehearsals, and the evening is for free study. "Chinese Salvation" has become strong in this way of carrying out collective learning and collective work. Any group or even individual, if you want to avoid falling behind, corruption, and deterioration, and want to make progress and achieve satisfactory results at all times, you must learn this style of "Chinese Salvation"!

Fifthly, in practical work, whether on the front lines, in the rear areas, or overseas, they strive to obtain the consent and support of local government troops and leaders from all walks of life, and strive to contact local cultural and theatrical circles and general salvation groups and social organizations. Therefore, all street work to work deep into trenches, rural areas, and factories can often achieve "twice the result with half the effort." This kind of work style is often ignored by general salvation groups. They claim to be "progressive," disdain to engage in upward activities, and do not hesitate to form opposition with groups of different parties, and even curse the united front due to small obstacles, resulting in nothing but setbacks. The working method of "Chinese Salvation" is worth learning, which is also the reason for this. However, all of these must also be determined according to the special environment, special conditions, and their own strength in various places. Of course, in many particularly harsh environments and extremely unprepared conditions, they should make necessary struggles according to their own strength, and should not use this as an excuse to carry out slack work.

Finally, we must also recognize clearly that the reason why "Chinese Salvation" can do this and can succeed is that on the one hand, they are good at carrying out self-criticism and humbly accepting all friendly criticisms, accepting the economics and lessons of progressive revolutionary parties and groups; on the other hand, every member has the confidence to win the final victory in the cause of the war of resistance and nation-building, and in the future of the cause of Chinese national liberation; they have a determined determination to serve the cause of the war of resistance, nation-building and cultural undertakings, and to sacrifice for the liberation of the Chinese nation. These two points are also the fundamental reasons for the development of all the above-mentioned "strengths" of Chinese Salvation, and it should be clearly recognized by our cultural and theatrical circles and all salvation groups!

### This Saturday's Baseball League: South China to Battle You Pi Team. The Two Teams Have Not Yet Been Defeated. Who Will Win This Time?

(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) The Open Baseball League began on the sixth of this month and has held a total of ten games so far. Among the six teams, the China and Min Diano South teams, which we recognize as having the best talent and strongest strength, have each lost once. The only teams that have remained undefeated so far are You Pi and South China.

Strong teams are inherently invincible, and weak teams can still achieve something. Observing the results of the China and Min teams, we can infer that the future game situation will undergo more changes. The strengths of the six teams are about the same. The previous winner cannot guarantee that they will not be defeated in the future, and the previous loser may not win in the future. Therefore, no matter which team meets, the competition will be fierce, and the outcome is difficult to predict.

It rained continuously last weekend, and baseball games were therefore suspended, which greatly disappointed the fans. The schedule for this weekend's games is as follows. If the weather clears up, there will definitely be a spectacle, because each match features opponents with equal strength. The schedule is announced in advance as follows:

2:30 PM on the 27th

You Pi Team vs. South China Club at Caroline Hill

10:00 AM on the 28th

China Team vs. Western Club at Caroline Hill

11:30 AM on the Same Morning

Min Diano vs. Hong Kong Club at Caroline Hill

The game on the 27th is especially noteworthy, because the two teams have not yet been defeated and have strong strength. This battle will determine who will win. The South China team has two good players, Bao Dui Ping and Feng Jingxiang. Because their trip to South Asia has been extended, they can still participate in the game when the time comes. Since they are competing with You Pi with a complete lineup, they can win. But in any case, the competition in this game will be fierce.

In the first game on the 28th, China will logically win, because China was the champion last year and its strength has not diminished. Although they were defeated by the Min team in their first game, this was due to a chance mistake and not because their skills were inferior. The Western team has lost both of its two games, and its record is very poor. However, the team has several good players and is not easy to beat. If they try their best in the game against China, they may only lose by a narrow margin.

In the second game, the Min team vs. Hong Kong, the fighting power of the two sides is not much different. There will be a fierce battle. However, the Min team is more balanced and has a higher chance of winning. The records of each team are as follows: (Ballpark Tycoon)

(Team Name) Games Won Lost (Record)

You Pi Team 2 2 0 1.000

South China Team 1 1 0 1.000

China Team 2 1 1 0.500

Min Diano 2 1 1 0.500

Hong Kong Club 1 0 1 0.000

Western Club 2 0 2 0.000

### Shan Zha Shi Is the Son of a General; An Bang Is the Second-Best Player in the Philippines

The Philippine Table Cup representatives Shan Zha Shi and An Bang have already passed through Hong Kong to the United States a few days ago. According to the Philippine Tennis Association, this is the third time to attend the Table Cup, and also the first time in the last eleven years. This time to participate in the North American zone, they will face the winners of Australia and Mexico in the first week. Shan is a college student, twenty years old, five feet four inches tall, and has been the Philippine champion for two years. He recently won the Philippine and Manila singles titles. He participated in the Saigon International Tennis Tournament last year and reached the semi-finals. He is extraordinarily calm when playing, and both his forehand and backhand are sure. He is truly a rare talent. His whole family is good at tennis, and the technique is passed down from generation to generation. In 1929, his father represented the Philippines at the Far Eastern Games, competing against China and Japan. Therefore, Shan can be called the son of a general. An is still studying in middle school, only eighteen years old, five feet two inches tall, and is the second-best player in the Philippines. Yugoslav Table Cup player Ake Jiemuke was poisoned by him in Manila last November. His ball is slow, high, and soft, reaching the baseline on both sides. It has the typical "cowhide candy" style, and it is difficult to win against him. His father is also a famous tennis player, who won the Philippine championship. He was selected as the Philippine tennis representative at the 1930 Far Eastern Games in Tokyo.

### Reporter Association Beach Bathing: Yang Sisters to Participate in Performance, With Singing Entertainment by Performing Stars

### Shenbao Cup Basketball Charity Tournament: Association to Pre-Sell Honorary Admission Tickets

The Shenbao Cup Women's Basketball Charity Tournament, decided by the Association, will begin on the evening of the 29th of this month. Initially, the Association wanted to adopt an elimination system, but since there were only six participating teams, to increase their competitive interest, it was changed to a single round-robin system. However, the seed method will still be used. The final match (June 10th) is scheduled to be between Zhi Xing and Zhonghua, as these two teams have the best talent and strongest strength, so it will be held last. In addition, the Association, for this charity event, to raise more funds, has printed admission tickets in three denominations: one dollar, fifty cents, and twenty cents. The one-dollar tickets are honorary tickets and will be distributed for pre-sale. It is expected that the ticket revenue will be considerable.

(54) One-Hand Cartwheel - The method is the same as before, except the hand touching the mat only uses the left (right) hand. Note that when turning to the left, you must use the left hand, and when turning to the right, you must use the right hand.

(55) Backward Roll - Stand with your back to the mat, quickly squat down and lean back, sequentially using the buttocks, back, shoulders, head, and other parts to touch the mat, rolling backward one revolution. Note that both hands must be bent next to the head, palms up, fingers pointing backward. When rolling to the point where the head touches the mat, the hands must immediately take advantage of the momentum to push off the mat, so that the whole body does not become crooked or tilted.

Note that the timing of straightening the abdomen and pushing off the mat must be when the center of gravity is passing over the head. If it is too early, the roll will not be completed, and if it is too late, the feet cannot be raised high.

(63) Backward Roll Headstand and Handstand - After straightening the abdomen and pushing off the mat according to the above method, as soon as the head leaves the mat, immediately raise the head to touch the mat, and use it with both hands as a fulcrum for a handstand. Note that the push off the mat should not use too much force, causing the head to lift too high off the mat.

(64) Supine Feet-Up - From the supine position, first raise the feet over the head, then put the feet down. When the feet pass in front of the head, quickly straighten the legs and stand up.

(65) Forward Roll Backward Roll - Any forward roll, using the method of standing up with crossed feet, after standing up, add a backward turning movement, and you can roll backward. At the same time, any backward roll, using the method of standing up with crossed feet, can also perform a forward roll after turning backward.

Note - The above actions can be performed consecutively in combinations. For example, after a head and hand somersault, you can add a forward roll, or after a headstand and handstand, you can continue to do a head and hand somersault, etc., which can be changed temporarily. In short, as long as two or more actions have successive speed, they can be performed consecutively. Only the learner can comprehend, so I will not list them one by one.

### Eloquence

— Geng Zhi

Since ancient times, China has had persuaders who specialize in using eloquence to gain high positions. This shows that eloquence is very effective. Besides being useful for becoming an official, eloquence also has the following benefits:

Avoiding being wronged. Some people can go into battle amidst thousands of troops but are unable to utter a word when facing someone, suffering all kinds of injustice. People with eloquence are different. No matter how many people argue with them, they can handle it with ease and always be victorious. Zhuge Liang's verbal battle with the Confucian scholars is a good example.

Resolving people's crises. "A word is worth nine tripods" and "A promise is worth a thousand gold" are sayings that demonstrate the power of words. Even if words are lacking, cleverness can still help resolve crises. Xie Daoyun's rescue of "Young Master" is a good example.

Nowadays, the use of eloquence is even more widespread. The reason is that every citizen should be concerned about national affairs and public service, requiring speeches and discussions everywhere. The "Speech" subject in Confucius' school has now become a required subject in all schools. Organizations such as "Speech Meetings" and "Debate Clubs" are designed to train eloquence. Now, in this troubled time for the nation, it is especially important to use eloquence to promote resistance against Japan and national salvation.

However, where there is advantage, there is disadvantage, which has always been the rule from ancient times. The disadvantages of eloquence seem to outweigh the advantages, which cannot be hidden:

Lying is the bad effect of eloquence. Lying requires eloquence, otherwise listeners will not believe it. Eloquent lies can indeed be told with great flair and persuasiveness, bringing the dead back to life. As for deceiving and killing a few people without facing consequences, that is commonplace. The so-called "fire bulls" can also be attributed to lying because their boastful words are unfounded and absurd, originating from the same source as lies.

Flattery is another negative effect of eloquence. Even if someone has the heart to flatter, but lacks the eloquence to do so, their flattery will definitely fall flat. Like a certain official in the late Qing Dynasty who praised a high official by saying, "I have long admired your cunning and treachery, which are feared by the court and the public." Those who are good at flattery will say to the person, "I know you don't like flattery," which will please the person and make them think they have found a confidant.

Therefore, although Confucius established a "Speech Specialization" in his "Apricot Altar University," he hated those who were good at speaking, calling them "sycophants." He bluntly rebuked: "Using eloquent words to overwhelm people breeds resentment. What is the use of flattery!" When he executed Shao Zhengmao in a fit of anger, one of Shao Zhengmao's crimes was "false and sophistical speech."

In addition, Zhu Yuanzhang's handling of Xu Xuan was also a great pleasure. It is said that Xu Xuan represented the Southern Tang dynasty to negotiate tribute arrangements. Because of his eloquence, for a time no one could be found to deal with him. Later, Emperor Taizu of Song personally selected an official who did not speak much, a "Attendant in Ordinary," which led to the following result: "Initially, Xuan's words were like clouds, and the onlookers were shocked. That person could not answer but only said 'yes, yes.' Xuan was puzzled and kept talking to him. After several days, there was no response, and Xuan became tired and bored!"

The "Eloquence" subject also includes scolding. I don't know if this is appropriate or inappropriate because as soon as one mentions scolding, everyone feels disgusted, thinking that it is at least an impolite expression, an act of insulting others and degrading oneself. Thus, when a village woman scolded a drunken man, she was considered by outsiders to have committed a vice. However, when we see Zhuge Liang scold Wang Lang to death, we feel a sense of pleasure. Jiao Da scolding the Rong and Ning mansions, saying that only the stone lions were clean, we cannot help but raise a cup to celebrate. How can we not clap our hands and shout: "Well scolded! Well scolded!"

Originally, scolding is never born out of indifference or emptiness. Real scolding is definitely not like a superior scolding a clerk or a boss scolding an employee, which is merely venting anger and showing off power. It is always because one's heart cannot bear it, so one erupts uncontrollably. Such scolding is often a wonderful article of eloquence. In ancient times, there were loyal ministers who knocked out their teeth and cut off their tongues, cursing the enemy to death with blood. There was also an old prostitute who scolded the enemy naked to relieve the siege of the city. There are many such examples.

In conclusion, if our eloquence cannot be used for good purposes, such as avoiding being wronged and resolving people's crises, nor should it be misused for bad purposes, such as lying and flattery. I think we should use it for purposes that are neither good nor bad, picking those who deserve to be scolded in this era and scolding them thoroughly until they have nowhere to go in heaven or on earth!

### Soliloquy Hanging Upside Down

— Dongfang

I opened this gravel factory, but I didn't steal from you. Why do you always look at me with disdain and refuse to let me go? Heaven didn't let me starve to death, leaving me with a little bit of work. It wasn't bombed or burned down. I came back like a dog, covered in mud, stealthily setting up this broken equipment, taking on a little business and stealing a bite to eat. Do you think I've become rich? At this time, to get rich, you have to be a "Chief" or a "Director," or simply lose your conscience like you, extorting everywhere, relying on special powers, cheating your own compatriots. For people like me, not starving to death is already good enough! Who knew that not starving to death would mean being executed by you? You beat me like this! Who can I tell my grievances to? Sigh!

The iron I bought was fair and square, with a seller and an invoice. You thought there was an opportunity to exploit, so you grabbed me with a big fuss, tied me up so tightly that it wasn't enough, and even used handcuffs! Am I a robber? Only robbers accuse innocent people of being robbers. How could I escape your hands? Such power is not necessary. What Industry Headquarters? Ha, you randomly draw, drawing all over the floor. What crime did I commit? After beating me unconscious, you pushed me into the small room next door, dark and damp, filled with the smell of mold and stench. Thank you for looking down on me and not letting me starve to death. I really can't eat those two bowls of gruel every day. I was locked up for five days. On the sixth day, you dragged me out again, released me, punched me hard on the back, and said, "Be smarter, friend, go." Am I a robber? Why did you release me again? I asked when I got back, oh, you took a hundred yuan! You are kidnappers, you are robbers, jackals! You use special powers to bully your own compatriots! You want money, but you don't need to be so fierce, beating people like this. I never stole anything from anyone, I never killed your father! This injury, how long will it take to heal? Pain, who can I tell?

Who can I tell? I see people and feel fear! Friends? They are all afraid, not daring to say a word! They are all afraid! You said, "Be smarter, if you resist again, we'll send you to the military police!" Ah, who can I tell? You have reminded me.

Can I still live here? You pass in front of my door in a grand manner, looking at me with red eyes. I'm trembling all over. I'll die of anger even if I don't starve to death! I can't go on living. I have to leave, go to...

Ah! Pain...

### Selling Beans (Part 2)

— By Ming Ji

——The Old Woman's Story——

"The villagers can recognize the roof tiles, so they must be familiar with each other," someone answered for her.

"Indeed," she replied quickly upon being spoken to, "It's rare to see someone from our village. How many 'people' are left behind?"

"Not many, probably. I don't really pay attention." A reply that was indifferent and unconcerned.

She looked at the doorway for a long time, finally noticing one person. This person was about forty years old, with a dark, reddish face, wearing short clothes, looking like a farmer. He had come out several times, each time empty-handed, but when he went back in, he had something in his hand, showing he was a messenger of some kind. Just as she was considering going down, this person walked into the building and came upstairs. She was delighted and began to prepare herself.

As soon as the man came upstairs, he went straight to a seat near the doorway, without hesitation. The waiter, seeing him seated, immediately brought tea without him even asking.

"Want some spiced beans?" The old woman walked to his table, seemingly very casually.

"No," he said, taking a sip of tea.

"Then how about some yellow sand beans?" She pointed to the basket.

"Okay, I'll have some yellow sand beans." He acknowledged the basket.

Hearing this, the old woman grabbed two handfuls and placed them in front of him, smiling as she looked at his face and said,

"I think I recognize you. Where do you live?"

"I think I recognize you too," he replied obligingly. Then he added, "I live in Li Family Bridge."

"Ah, Li Family Bridge. My maiden home is in Li Family Bridge," the old woman said with excitement. "What's your name?"

"My name is Li Jingen."

"Haha, that's right! You were still very young when I saw you," she said, displaying the emotion of someone meeting an old acquaintance. "Have you been working outside all this time?"

"Yes, I've been working as a messenger in this customs office."

Then she asked him many questions about the customs office, and he asked her about her experience selling beans in this town. They became more and more intimate as they talked, just like relatives. The only difference was that he was standing, and she was standing, indicating that one was drinking tea and the other was doing business.

"You must be doing very well now?" she asked quietly, changing the subject slightly.

"Well, that's hard to say..." His tone also lowered.

"Jingen!" After they had been talking for a long time, someone downstairs called out to him. He stood up, preparing to leave, answering, "Coming, coming!" and reaching into his pocket for money.

"It's alright, pay tomorrow. I'll be here for a few more days," the old woman quickly stopped him.

"Okay, I'll pay tomorrow." Jingen went downstairs.

The next day, he indeed ate her beans again and talked with her for a while. When he went downstairs, she still didn't take his money, saying, "Pay tomorrow."

However, when he came to the teahouse the next day, he could no longer find her shadow. He thought that maybe she would come again tomorrow, so he didn't take it to heart.

But she never came back to this teahouse, because she had already returned to her village.

As soon as we saw her return, everyone welcomed her.

"Good news is back! Everyone, listen up!" Wang Mingyuan shouted first.

"There's no good news," the old woman said, placing her cloth bag on the table. "There are some beans left over here; you can eat them."

"What? Where did these beans come from?" Everyone saw the beans dumped on the table.

"Leftovers from selling."

"You went to sell beans? Then what's the news?"

"Oh, I forgot," she said, feigning surprise. "I only knew about selling beans, but I forgot the important matter."

"Tell us, tell us," everyone knew she was joking.

"I really forgot. You guys sort these beans and count them, and maybe I'll remember." Everyone didn't understand what she meant. But they believed she had a reason, so they did as she said, sorting them one by one.

"How many yellow sand beans are there?" she asked. "The fewest, only three."

"Then I'll tell you: there are at least three small cannons."

"Oh!" Everyone then understood and let out a collective breath.

"How about salt-soaked beans?"

"Six."

"That means heavy machine guns."

After that, there were fourteen spiced beans, meaning light machine guns; one hundred and eighteen sprouted beans, meaning rifles.

"And what about the two hundred and eighty-two crispy beans?" Wang Mingyuan asked impatiently at the end.

"Does that even need to be said?" the old woman smiled. "Besides guns and cannons, what else do we need to know?"

"Damn it," Wang Mingyuan also laughed. "I was so confused."

The old woman then separated and marked the different kinds of beans on the table, pointing to each pile and saying,

"These are stationed at the bathhouse in Liqiaokou Wulongwei; these are stationed at the City Public Cocoon Exchange; these are..."

She spoke and pointed clearly, leaving a deep impression in everyone's minds, as if they had personally been to Qingzhen.

"Now you really should eat these beans," she said after she finished speaking.

"Okay, I'll eat a machine gun!"

"I'll eat..."

In an atmosphere of laughter and joy, all the beans on the table were eaten, but the things these beans represented had already been recorded by someone else, and the beans were indeed useless.

A few days later, the Shanghai newspapers had detailed reports of Qingzhen being briefly captured. There were also mentions of Wang Mingyuan's name, but there was no mention of the old woman. Who would believe that the old woman selling beans was related to this matter? Even Li Jingen is still wondering why she hasn't come to collect the bean money. (The End)

### Rejection and Exploration

— By Qian Changshou

I scattered all the memories, but they are like a swarm of detestable flies, flying back at once, buzzing constantly in my ears.

Gently pushing open the door of my heart, inside, lies my old memories.

A silent heart is like a white sailboat sailing on the current of memory. It takes me to distant places:

Past events that once made me shed tears can no longer provoke my sadness; old stories that once made me happy can no longer make me laugh.

Having rejected everything in the past, my heart begins to feel empty again.

Everything from the past should be rejected. I will take my heart to a distant place where no footprints have gone, to explore something that can fill the emptiness in my heart.

### Seeking

— By Li Chen

Fragrant flowers grow beside thorns. Luxuriant weeds grow around beautiful flower clusters, often bringing a comforting smile to a weary traveler's face. Yes, even if this turbulent world is a desert, it is a source of water. And in this universe, filled with wind and thunder, we can still see the colors of the blue sky because of it.

In solitude, flowers seem to be the spiritual refuge for restless lives. Who wouldn't regard them as comfort for wounded souls?

However, this world seems so narrow that it cannot accommodate any fragrant flower.

Thus, when the vast journey looms before us, each person resembles a sail that has lost its anchor, drifting aimlessly. Where will the wind take us next? No one can know.

Seeking a flower, a solace for wounds, has sacrificed countless lives, to liberate the fragrant grass pressed in the crevices of rocks: to guide a lost lamb: to beautify this world, to warm this universe, who would begrudge a handful of sweat, a drop of blood, or even their own life?

Crossing forests, traversing deserts, countless people courageously embark on this journey, bearing the wind and frost, carrying hardships on their shoulders, and walking half or most of the way with weary hearts and dusty faces. Unfortunately, some encounter lions and tigers on mountain paths, engaging in fierce battles, resulting in mutual destruction. Others, due to accidental mistakes, swallow flowers with deadly outer skins.

I am moved by these crowds of people who "died for their ideals." They cleared obstacles with their lives, leaving behind a path to the future. They give people the revelation of "struggle"; they give people the warning of "poisoning." What could be more precious than the "bloody experience" left by our predecessors?

If you cherish a potted plant by the window, if you yearn for a few flowers in a greenhouse, then you should look towards the distance: the free paradise filled with colorful flowers is beckoning to you. Bravely go and seek it! The flesh and blood of our predecessors have already paved the way for you!
