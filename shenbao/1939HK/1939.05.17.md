### Two Wartime Dispatches from the Rear

The Japanese Rear - Shanghai - Fresh Blood Dyes the Glorious National Flag Red

[Shanghai Correspondence] Shanghai, an isolated island. Regarding the issue of the national flag, from last year until now, there have been many tragic and moving events.

Heroic Past Deeds

Last year, to commemorate the anniversary of August 13th, at the intersection of the concession and the Chinese area, for hanging flags, the Japanese army even opened fire on the Blue Sky White Sun flags hanging in the residences of the concession, so until now, it is not easy to see the Blue Sky White Sun flag in those places during anniversaries.

Also last year, around the time of Double Tenth Festival, a rice shop on Route Paul Henry de Segonzac, a road built beyond the boundary of the Shanghai Western District, was discovered by a Japanese military officer for hanging the Blue Sky White Sun flag. He attempted to snatch it away and even wanted to commit violence. Fortunately, American soldiers intervened and nothing happened. However, since then, it has been rare to see the Blue Sky White Sun flag hanging in the areas of roads built beyond the boundary.

The fact that the Lone Army of the Four Banks was beaten and injured by White Russian soldiers for hanging the national flag is well known to readers; however, since that dispute, the flagpole for raising the flag has not been as high as before.

This spring, a brave man went to the Dongchang Road area in Pudong to hang the national flag, but was unfortunately arrested and beheaded by the Japanese. Before being beheaded, the Japanese soldiers pierced the Blue Sky White Sun flag onto a bamboo pole, sharpened the other end of the bamboo pole, and stabbed it into his back, and escorted him to parade in Dongchang Road and other places; all Chinese people who saw it could not help but shed tears. No wonder when the puppet police forced the people living in those areas to hang the puppet flags, they either did not hang them, or hung them upside down, or lowered the national flag.

The Tragedy Begins

Since the French Concession authorities twice interfered with the hanging of the national flag on March 12th and March 29th, the Chinese living in the French Concession have taken the matter of hanging the national flag very seriously. Therefore, on April 19th, the day of the General Mobilization of Spiritual Strength for Industry and Commerce Propaganda, residents and shops in the French Concession unanimously competed to hang the flag. Who knew that this would lead to disputes and tragedies, resulting in a major strike.

Around 9 o'clock in the morning, a large number of Russian police and Annamese police came to interfere with the shops and residents hanging the flag, asking them to take it down. Some refused, while others complied. Usually, for not complying with the removal of the flag, at most there would be a fine, so many shops and residents would rather be fined than take it down. Those who took it down would soon hang it up again. Unexpectedly, the Russian and Annamese police beat and arrested people, and confiscated the flag. Moreover, some Annamese and Russian police used bayonets to tear the national flag that had already been taken down in compliance into strips, or threw it on the ground, causing multiple damages to the national flag. "It's fine not to let us hang the flag, but we shouldn't insult the national flag representing China in this way!" As a result, all the shops voluntarily closed their doors and suspended business to express their protest.

After 4 o'clock, more shops voluntarily suspended business to express their protest. After 7 o'clock, Avenue Edward VII, which was usually very lively and brightly lit, completely turned into a ghost town, shrouded in a dim and miserable atmosphere. People were indignant and silent. Although armored vehicles occasionally passed by, no one paid attention to them. Although the Russian and Annamese police were very proud holding wooden sticks, they gradually felt bored and the number of people gradually decreased.

Recognizing the Japanese

On the morning of the 20th, the French Concession had fallen into a complete general strike. After 10 o'clock, there were even more strikes. The Chamber of Commerce's勸吿(勸吿) to resume business was also ineffective. Finally, the Chinese Taxpayers Association issued a notice stating that in order to maintain the long-standing friendly relations between China and France, this incident was entirely due to the improper actions of the Annamese and Russian police, and that they would proceed cautiously to negotiate based on reason. However, to prevent奸人(奸人) from creating trouble, they hoped that everyone would temporarily endure the pain and resume business first. At the same time, a prominent Shanghai merchant residing in Hong Kong also telegraphed various important public organizations, asking them to recognize the enemy and handle the matter properly. Therefore, after 4 o'clock, all the merchants listened to the勸吿(勸吿) and resumed business first.

After so many struggles and sacrifices by the sons and daughters of China in Shanghai, one day, in a day of universal jubilation, the national flag will surely be raised together with our Blue Sky White Sun flag by all friendly countries, except for the invaders.

Our Rear - Guilin - Early Summer Joint Friendship Meeting - Friendship 送鹿亘 (Guilin Correspondence) Since withdrawing from Wuhan, Mr. Luge Diheng has moved to Guilin, and it has been exactly five and a half months. During this period, in addition to completing a book of more than 100,000 words, "Record of the Peace Village," he has further studied the Japanese situation and has also lectured at a Japanese training class. After returning, he also served as a full-time lecturer in the Japanese language training class, explaining the recent situation of the Japanese and the key points of propaganda work against Japan. Although he did not stay in the Japanese language training class for a long time, he gave intensive lectures every week and helped students solve many problems, which greatly benefited the students. Therefore, when he had to temporarily say goodbye to Guilin due to official business, the students held a special farewell party, partly to express their farewell to him, and at the same time, everyone had a good time and strengthened their future learning spirit to show that they would not disappoint the expectations of their teachers.

The time was at 6 pm on the 7th, on that vast green lawn. The evening wind gently kissed the neat grass-green military uniforms. More than 200 male and female students sat in a circle listening to Mr. Luge Dijian's farewell message. Today, Luge Diheng was particularly excited, waving his fists, and his rhythmic tone showed his love for these more than 200 young people. Although it was a temporary farewell, everyone's hearts were filled with a common emotion, and the determination to fight violence to the end, and especially慎重(慎重)ly put forward the key points that political workers should always grasp in the future: "...War is a clash of swords, and political work is an invisible fight. If we have some negligence, the Japanese will give us a fatal blow. Therefore, political workers should be particularly careful and work hard everywhere. Everything must be understood from the root and a comprehensive understanding must be obtained. For example, the Japanese recently want to exploit five million tons of iron in the occupied areas and are currently planning it. If we want to find a way to break this plan, we must ask for an understanding of the whole problem, and we must find a way to know how much capital the Japanese need to exploit five million tons of iron and to what extent the plan has been carried out. With a concrete knowledge base, we can obtain clues, and then use these clues to break the Japanese conspiracy. At the same time, we must always be vigilant and not relax for a minute in observing and identifying things. This is to overcome with the strength of the general mobilization of spirit. So if every citizen has a unique observation of any fact, then the general mobilization of spirit can be said to have achieved success..." Finally, Luge Diheng repeated, "We will continue to struggle hard together, and our blood vessels will always be injected with the same blood..."

After Luge Diheng's speech ended in a burst of enthusiastic applause, Feng Naichao's concise and powerful speech rang in everyone's ears. He explained that language is a weapon. Today, the Japanese we learn can be used as dynamite and thrown into the Japanese camp, giving the Japanese a great threat. And when the Japanese warlords and we finish fighting for a while, we will use this weapon to eliminate the mutual隔閔(隔閔) and hatred between the people and establish permanent human peace. So what everyone learns in this shortest time is not a waste, but bears a particularly great mission.

Team leader Wang, accompanied by Luge Diheng and Feng Naichao, had dinner on the土墩(土墩) they had filled in themselves. In the evening breeze, they watched the students enthusiastically rejoice, perform, and sing until about 9 o'clock, when they bid farewell to this atmosphere full of vitality and returned.

Wartime Capital - Chongqing - Japanese Planes Set Great Fire - Mountain City's Righteous Indignation is High

(Chongqing Correspondence) The sun was already shining obliquely on the mountain city, and it was almost dusk. People were preparing to participate in the May Fourth Commemoration Meeting. A long air raid siren sounded. Due to the enemy's疯狂(疯狂) bombing of Chongqing on "May 3rd," people had already hidden in air raid shelters before the emergency air raid siren. Following the emergency air raid siren, Japanese planes invaded the skies of Chongqing. The well-ordered formation of the Japanese planes had already been dispersed by our high-altitude artillery. The Japanese planes frantically dropped incendiary bombs in the skies of the historic and civilized mountain city. The incendiary bombs ignited in the air. Hundreds of red fireballs fell from the sky to the center of Chongqing. The Japanese,慌惶(慌惶)亂(亂)ly threw bombs and then hurriedly fled for their lives under the pursuit of our planes.

Fireballs fell into the center of Chongqing. Flames rose one after another, and the sky was full of black smoke. The red fire illuminated Chongqing. Houses collapsed in a row. People were shouting. The fire burned with the wind. The sky was full of flying wood chips, even more than the sparks of fireworks. Street after street was burning with fire. The red light illuminating Chongqing was brighter than daylight. The most prosperous commercial streets: Douyu Street, Chaijia Lane, Cangping Street, Xinfeng Street, Qixinggang, all became fire dragons. The red fire became a river of fire. The whole of Chongqing became a sea of fire.

People were rescuing merchandise, luggage, suitcases, and goods. Stretcher teams and temporary ambulance teams organized by various agencies and groups were rescuing the wounded compatriots, women, and children. Corpses that had been charred in the sea of fire were carried out one by one.

Streets that had not been affected were full of luggage, suitcases, merchandise, old women, and women sitting on some of the scattered belongings they had rescued, watching the fire set by the Japanese turn happy families into ashes. No one was crying, and not even the women and children were shedding tears. The flames of people's anger were higher than the flames of the Japanese. Everyone was gritting their teeth, vowing to avenge this blood fire in the fire-lit night.

The Chongqing branch of the Commercial Press was completely burned down. Ta Kung Pao and Xinhua Daily were burned. The Sichuan Provincial Bank Office, the China National Goods Company, the Cathay Hotel, the Post Office, and countless shops and countless happy families were all burned to ashes. The German Consulate was also burned down by the Japanese fascist **. Coincidentally, only a white curtain was left fluttering in the wind. The French and British Consulates were also on fire. This is what the Japanese broadcast that night: "We are carrying out a large-scale bombing with the Military Affairs Committee's headquarters as the target, completely crushing all military agencies and achieving results beyond expectations."

After setting the great fire, the Japanese fascist ** laughed wildly, wanting to celebrate this act of destroying humanity. The fire burned from May 4th to May 5th, and was still burning late into the night of May 6th. The wounded were crowded in hospitals. Charred corpses were carried out from the fire one by one. Corpses piled up on the streets, men, women, old, young, adults, and children together, piled up as high as mountains, big and small. Can this blood feud and fire debt not be avenged? The Chinese people must never watch this暴×(暴×) rampant in the world again.

The people of the city were rationally evacuating. Disaster victims began to register. Bread and steamed buns were distributed in the disaster area. Chairman Chiang personally issued an edict that all private and public cars in the city should be concentrated and used exclusively for evacuating citizens. Citizens who went outside the city from inside the city were transported by the concentrated cars to nearby villages they wanted to go to without compensation. From late at night to dawn, people were constantly evacuating.

The fire field was constantly being dug up, and corpses were being unearthed. There were dead bodies everywhere in the city. People were busy rescuing and rescuing. Ten newspapers in Chongqing were mostly burned down. Temporarily, the Central Daily News, Ta Kung Pao, Shih Shih Hsin Pao, Sao Tang Pao, Hsin Shu Pao, Hsin Min Pao, Southwest Daily, Commercial Daily, and National Gazette published a joint edition. Xinhua Daily published a half-page newspaper in a difficult struggle. The city's activities were completely moved outside the city.

The fire in Chongqing gradually extinguished after burning for more than fifty hours. However, the flames of hatred in the hearts of the Chinese people against the Japanese fascist ** will never be extinguished. May 7th morning

All Guilin Journalists Take Blood Oath - Telegraph Condolences to Chongqing Colleagues - Raise Donations to Aid Disaster-Stricken Compatriots

There were mainly members here, but there were also non-members and printing workers and workers.

After Chairman Mo铿(莫鏗) held a solemn oath ceremony, Liu Caiqing, the representative of the Provincial Party Headquarters, delivered a speech of encouragement as the oath supervisor. Then Yao Jixiu, the representative of the Guilin branch, reported that the Guilin news community telegraphed condolences to the various newspapers in Chongqing and telegraphed condolences to Comrade Li Yao of the Central News Agency. In addition to the telegram of condolences to the affected compatriots in Chongqing, they will also raise funds for relief.

To the Chongqing Municipal Government, please forward to all compatriots in the city: Japanese crazy bombing of Chongqing. Compatriots innocently suffered. The blood feud and injustice, how can we not avenge it? We hope that you will listen to the government's leadership, actively participate in the War of Resistance, wipe out the Japanese **, and share peace and prosperity. In addition to jointly raising donations with the Guilin and Los Angeles communities for relief, we send a special telegram of condolence. (Same signatories as above) The Guilin branch of the Qingji Association telegraphed the Ministry of Propaganda of the Central Committee yesterday, requesting severe punishment of Japanese-controlled newspapers and publications such as Nanhua Daily, Tian Daily, International Weekly, Freedom Review, and Times Selections, in order to eliminate the roots of chaos. The original text is recorded as follows: To Minister Ye Jun of the Central Propaganda Department. Wang Jingwei **...** Recently, they have intensified their efforts to wantonly slander the Central Government, often spreading rumors in their self-run Hong Kong Nanhua Daily, and buying **Daily, **Weekly, **Review, **Selections and other newspapers and publications in the area to spread their rumors... This is the most extreme case. Therefore, we telegraphed your office to quickly order the above-mentioned newspapers and publications to be effectively dealt with in order to correct international views and prevent汉奸(汉奸) from causing chaos. This is our sincere prayer. Also, we telegraphed the headquarters of the Central News Agency to forward to its Hong Kong branch to stop supplying all telegraphic news and materials to the above-mentioned **newspapers. The original telegram is omitted. Also, the "Life Daily" published by ** and the "Oriental Daily" published in Shanghai have recently appeared in the city. The content is to spread the atmosphere of peace and all kinds of absurd remarks. The provincial government has strictly ordered it to be investigated and banned, and strictly prohibited its entry at the entrance.

General Li Zongren's Roar - We Must Respond to Japanese Aggression with Action

(Guilin Correspondence) When the morning mist shrouding the mountain city had not yet dissipated at 7 am, large slogans written in large white characters on large blue cloths were hung at the intersections of the streets,醒目(醒目)ly writing "Commemorate the National Humiliation of May 9th, Implement General Mobilization of National Spirit." Several agencies and shops that had opened their doors hung half-mast national flags. Thousands of armed comrades, public officials, students... lined up to go to the Public Stadium.

At the front of the stage in the stadium, a banner was horizontally hung, reading: "Guangxi All Circles May 9th National Humiliation Commemoration Conference." Then, the broadcast opened and broadcasted loud and clear salvation songs. The ranks of gray armed forces and gray-blue uniforms gradually filled the gaps in the middle of the square. On the stage, Chairman Li, Madam Li, and representatives from all circles arrived. Then, Chairman Bai of the conference walked onto the stage amidst the敬禮(敬禮) of the entire venue. More than a month of奔波(奔波) on various battlefields had indeed made him thinner, but it did not reduce his upright spirit and solemn威(威) appearance. The conference began amidst the sound of music.

Chairman Bai delivered the opening remarks, first briefly explaining the history of May 9th. Then he talked about the significance of commemorating "May 9th" this year: "Since the signing of the Twenty-One Demands until now, every aggression of the enemy against us has been based on the main points of that苛(苛)条约(条约). The outbreak of the War of Resistance gave the Japanese a fierce blow. Now that the War of Resistance has entered the second stage, we are getting closer to紛碎(紛碎) this kind of restraint. Today, commemorating May 9th must be commemorated by intensifying the法(法) war. First, we must adhere to a protracted war and launch a full-scale war. The victory of the War of Resistance does not only depend on the implementation of general mobilization of spirit, and the implementation of economic opposition to lock. According to my recent inspections of various battlefields, the Japanese are clearly getting weaker and weaker. Also, according to people who recently returned from Japan, the war in the past 22 months has been a profound pain in the lives of the Japanese people. The war has taken away their leather shoes, ties, and women's 　(　)children, and if they continue to fight, their lives will also be消滅(消滅)ed. The final victory is not far away - secondly, we must intensify the好(好) work. Third, the international peace forces are growing stronger day by day, and we must strive for international justice as an aid to our country's victory in the War of Resistance..." Finally, he said very沉重(沉重)ly: "Snow Shame - Snow Shame - cannot be accomplished by formal commemorative meetings and lip service. It must be expressed with action." Then everyone shouted slogans enthusiastically, expressing their determination.

Editorial

### Japan's Recent Adventures

The untamed Japanese aggressors now seem to have reached the end of their hesitation and entered the first step of starting　(　)　　　.

In this period, the aggressor's struggle will inevitably take on a special posture. We can see this in the aggressor's political and strategic policies towards China, and its foreign policy towards third countries. Japan's operations against China have resulted in many deaths and injuries. According to confirmed information, the number of casualties is close to more than 900,000, and the number of troops膠着(膠着) on various battlefields is also more than one million. With the expansion of the battlefield, the aggressor's army allocation has felt very difficult. But since the aggressor has no way to收拾(收拾) this war situation, they naturally plan to come back to迴光(迴光)返照(返照) a few times. As a result, the inhumane bombing of major cities began. Cities following Chongqing have suffered destruction. They launched shameless汉奸(汉奸) to carry out activities everywhere, also for the sake of responding to this massacre.

The aggressor's diplomacy towards third countries has also felt束手無策(束手無策). The "friendly diplomacy" announced by the Hiranuma Cabinet has completely碰(碰)了壁(了壁). Although Shigemitsu Aoi is still exploring Britain's attitude in London, thinking of it as the basis for adjusting British-Japanese relations, but from the general trend, the Japanese warlords have become焦灼(焦灼). The outwardly fierce but inwardly timid Japanese diplomatic posture has continued in Tianjin Concession and Shanghai Concession　(　)　　　　　　, and they have blatantly landed on Gulangyu, attempting to occupy this public concession of various countries. This is still a kind of intimidation and exploration, but the aggressor's ambition has been quite revealed.

Recent Japanese輿論(輿論), especially several newspapers representing the consciousness of the military, such as "Kokumin Shimbun" and "Yomiuri Shimbun," have made an objective analysis of the new situation in the Sino-Japanese War and put forward specific proposals. They believe that the new stage of dealing with the Sino-Japanese War requires new methods. They believe that there are two aspects to the strength that supports China's strong resistance: one is the active assistance of third countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union; the other is the strong Chinese national spirit based on the Three Principles of the People. There are two strategies for dealing with third countries: coordination and recklessness. They argue that the prospects for coordination are very few and hope is little, so they can only adopt reckless methods. This occupation of Gulangyu is an even higher level of recklessness towards third countries. If the experiment of Gulangyu is successful, then not to mention the concessions of third countries, even their rights and interests in China will be completely swept away by the aggressor. Secondly, the aggressor launched soulless汉奸(汉奸) to shake our country's spirit of resistance, and intensified their political and cultural activities.　　　 They have indeed arrived in Shanghai, and fish soldiers and shrimp generals are already in　(　)　　　　　布(布)置ing their迷魂(迷魂)阵(阵).

Our government and people have their own methods to eliminate traitors for the activities of the汉奸(汉奸), and their煽惑(煽惑) will not be effective on the nationals who have been磨练(磨练) for 22 months. Only recklessness towards third countries requires appropriate and effective measures from third countries. Recently, the Yomiuri Shimbun of Japan commented that the Japanese government has reached a certain conclusion on its policy towards third countries, that is, moderate means are not enough to solve the problem of public concessions, and the government feels the need to perform surgical operations on public concessions. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita further stated that because "the attitude of Britain and the United States is stubborn," a strong step has been decided to solve the problem of the Shanghai Public Concession. This further proves that our speculation is not without basis. In this regard, third countries need more active and effective measures. Regarding the attitude of the Gulangyu issue, the United Kingdom and the United States have paid considerable attention, but except for the United States being more active, there has been no further indication as of now. Thousands upon thousands of Chinese compatriots are already in an environment of隨便(隨便) 残(残)杀(杀) and detention, but this is not just a Chinese disaster!

### The Borderlands in the Rear of the War and International Thoroughfares: The Life of the Yi People in Western Yunnan

— Min Lian (sent from Mangshi)

"The flowers on this mountain are so beautiful,

I wish I could find someone as lovely as a flower,

But alas,

I can never seem to find such a one." The woman sings in response.

"The flowers on this mountain are truly beautiful,

It's a pity I am not someone as lovely as a flower;

But alas,

I hope someone will come and talk to me." The man sings again:

"You are indeed as beautiful as these flowers,

Truly,

If you do not refuse my words,

I would like to come and talk with you." There's more after that, but I don't remember it clearly, but singing to this point generally means a decision has been made. There are also some mountain songs. Using the moon as a metaphor, depicting one's own loneliness, these are also sung a lot. However, the claim of promiscuity among the Yi people, according to those who have lived there for a long time, is not the case. The so-called promiscuous group are not women from ordinary families, but rather maids in the Tusi (chieftain) yamen (office). Because each Tusi yamen always buys anywhere from thirty to forty or even fifty or sixty maids to serve, their treatment is very harsh. When the autumn harvest comes, young men carry several rupees in their large bags. At this time, they go up the mountain, partly to earn a little money for themselves and partly to alleviate their sexual frustration. Only they are relatively easy to agree with after a few songs. Widows also engage in this behavior; but in general, young men and women, although they openly seek love, the consideration period is very long. In particular, the Yi people value oaths and definitely do not engage in casual relationships.

Public Works

In the border areas, public works are virtually non-existent. If one were to insist, there are only some temples, a few public graveyards, and a few incomplete schools. There are no public health facilities. Pigs and dogs run wild along the roads, and cattle and horses are in disarray. There are no hospitals or medicine. When Yi people get sick, they simply worship gods and offer sacrifices to ghosts, and use some unreliable folk remedies. They don't necessarily have to die,

but instead, they slowly watch them die. In each Tusi family, there are two trainees from a certain medical school in Burma working as doctors. They can also give vaccinations, but they charge exorbitant prices, which ordinary Yi people do not inquire about. Aside from a few incomplete small schools, the Yi people have no opportunity to enjoy cultural education. The last time people from the interior went to show some science films, the Yi people watched, filling the streets and lanes, showing how eager the Yi people are to learn. There are no public buildings that benefit the public. Besides seeing dirty streets and earthen walls covered with cow dung cakes (used as firewood), there is nothing to admire.

National Consciousness

Although the national consciousness of the Yi people has been neglected for hundreds of years, they are still very enthusiastic about the Han people and about China. In the past, they only knew about the Tusi, but today, they already know that above the Tusi, there is also the provincial government of Yunnan, there is also Chairman Chiang, and there is the entire Republic of China. Especially recently, our transportation on the border has been busy, which easily excites them. Many Yi people already know that our China and Japanese imperialism are fighting desperately. They are very faithfully helping to build roads and very excitedly helping to transport goods. Yi soldiers are also as loyal and brave as Chinese soldiers, raising their guns, day and night, and defending our wartime wealth without slackening. Even the Tusi, in the past, due to the enticement of foreigners, became indifferent to China, but since the War of Resistance, their perception has changed. I think this is the best time for us to win them over to the inner front and work together for the liberation of the great Chinese nation.

Conclusion

In the rear of the War of Resistance, on the national defense border line, stand these thousands and tens of thousands of Yi compatriots. Their every move, their food and clothing, should attract our attention: How to understand their complex national character; how to use their instinctive sturdiness to organize a force for the War of Resistance; how to appropriately, but bravely and decisively, reform their existing unsound social system and administrative structure; how to systematically organize and train their original armed forces to develop into a huge national defense force on the border; how to proactively and decisively resolve many diplomatic disputes; how to help them develop their economy to improve their daily lives; how to help them develop public works to improve their existing harsh living environment; how to make use of their original good customs, habits, and the foundation of language, writing, and education to raise their cultural level, and thereby strengthen their solidarity as a great Chinese nation, united in resisting the consciousness of aggression. These issues, today's wise War of Resistance government, wise experts and scholars, loyal War of Resistance and national salvation groups and organizations, and the patriotic compatriots of the whole country, should put them on the agenda and give them prompt discussion and implementation. The Chinese nation is a whole. Today, our people only have one goal: to defeat Japanese [text obscured]!

### Crushing the [Enemy] Warlord's Air Raid Plan: Chairman Chiang's Proclamation to the Whole Nation

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] Chairman Chiang, in order to prevent [enemy] planes from bombing, has recently issued a letter to the provincial and municipal governments and compatriots across the country. The full text is as follows: Since the beginning of this month, [enemy] planes have bombed civilian residential areas in various parts of our country more than fifty times. In Chongqing alone, the total number of compatriots killed and injured has reached thousands. In addition to Fuzhou, Xi'an, Luoyang, Xiangfan, and various places in the front lines of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, which have suffered countless bombings, other cities without military facilities or areas where military agencies are not located, such as Quanzhou, Changting, Qiongzhou, Shaoguan, Longxi, Tong'an, Shantou, Ningbo, Jinhua, Hengyang, Zhijiang, Yuanling, and Hanzhong, have also been subjected to indiscriminate bombings, suffering injuries and slaughter. Blood has flowed across the land, and flames have filled the sky. The cruelty is beyond description. The [enemy] bandits often claim that they only bomb areas with military facilities; this kind of despicable statement, a base and habitual trick, is already well-known to both Chinese and foreigners. How can they conceal their barbaric and violent crimes?

Three Purposes of [Enemy] Air Raids

There are only three purposes for [enemy] planes to bomb our civilians so fiercely: First, to use continuous bombing to threaten the spirit of resistance of our people across the country, hoping that our compatriots will kneel and surrender; second, to use fierce bombing to cut off the lives of our compatriots, attempting to reduce production among our compatriots in displacement, affecting the future of our War of Resistance; third, to use concentrated bombing to harm the tranquility of our society,妄 想 to disrupt the order of our rear. - The [enemy] has these three purposes, and they also know that the foundation of our national salvation lies entirely in the people, so they want to destroy our nation. They must first cut off the lives of our people. This is why their bombing, burning, and killing must choose areas where our civilians are densely populated. Not only is this the case in Chongqing, but also in other places. Moreover, their future cruel and bestial acts will be even worse than today.

Suffering Brutality: How to Retaliate?

Our compatriots across the country, suffering brutality, clearly understand their poisonous plot, and should do everything possible to prevent and retaliate against it. Here, I present three things to tell our compatriots: (1) Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, it has been almost two years. The morale and unity of our people have surpassed those of ancient times, astonishing the world. The [enemy] has seen this and believes that if they do not indulge their [bestial] nature and display their ferocity and cruelty, then their plan of aggression has reached its end, and the trend of collapse will be immediate. Therefore, within half a month, they have engaged in blind and frenzied bombing, inhumane and unprecedented catastrophe. Our compatriots have been subjected to their poison for two years and are no longer surprised by it. However, having recently suffered such frenzied bombing, they are still able to remain calm and act as usual. This kind of spirit is enough to strip the [enemy's] soul and制毒計毒計 prevent their poisonous plan. Moreover, governments at all levels are working diligently and vigilantly, and doing their best to protect the people. All measures, both passive and active, are now becoming more and more complete. In the future, we will not only not worry about their continuous bombing, but we will also make them waste their efforts and exhaust themselves, so as to crush their primary goal.

Resisting to the End: Seeking Survival in Death

However, our compatriots should know that what the [enemy] will bomb in the future is definitely not limited to one city or one town, but their goal is all the cities in our country and the entire nation. As for the government and military facilities, although they have been bombed many times, the losses are minimal because they are somewhat afraid. This can be proved by the fact that they did not dare to carry out low-altitude bombing in our military equipment areas in the past. On the contrary, all places without military equipment are subjected to indiscriminate and frenzied bombing at any time and any place, without any consideration. From this, we know that if our country cannot actively strengthen its military force and resist to the end, then the whole country will surrender its arms and be slaughtered, waiting for death. If this is the case, the [enemy's] flame will be even more fierce, and the danger of destruction will be immediate. Not only will our modern compatriots be slaughtered, but also our nation will never recover for generations to come. Therefore, our compatriots across the country should be even more determined to resist to the end in order to achieve the goal of seeking survival in death. I deeply believe that my people will be able to learn a profound lesson from this tragic bombing, remember this deep hatred, and never forget it for the rest of their lives, passing it on to future generations until we annihilate the [enemy] and avenge our dead compatriots.

Going to the Countryside: Developing Rural Areas

(2) Before issuing the order to evacuate the citizens, the government had already started the necessary preparations. Rural areas are the source of life for our people. The fertile land can be cultivated and studied. The simple rooms can be rested and worked in. There are more than a million villages in the surrounding areas of the city. As long as each family accommodates one person, it will be more than enough to accommodate the entire city. However, our citizens who go to the countryside should strictly abide by the government's regulations and appreciate the enthusiasm of our fellow villagers for their care: those with skills should assist in the development of the countryside; those who are educated should often educate the children of farmers, helping each other and sharing joys and sorrows. In this way, not only will the citizens have a place to rest, but the countryside will also flourish. This is not only a temporary plan to avoid disaster, but also the foundation of nation-building. The key to certain victory lies entirely in the reliance on rural areas, enriching rural areas, and developing production, which is to lay the foundation of the country and enhance national strength. Now, because of the continuous atrocities of [enemy] planes, we can establish our grand plan for nation-building. The second purpose of the [enemy] will not only be crushed as a result, but our great cause of nation-building will also be realized as a result. However, what should be noted is that on the one hand, we should actively evacuate, and on the other hand, we should strengthen organization to strengthen the fortress of our spirit of resistance. In this way, even if [enemy] planes use their full strength to attack continuously, compared to the vastness of our country's land and the number of towns, it is no different from a grain of millet in a granary. Therefore, after our urban compatriots live in the countryside, the [enemy's] plan will be exhausted, and they will have no way to use their skills.

Protection and Cooperation

(3) For the residents who remain in the city, governments at all levels should do their best to protect them, such as opening fire lanes, piling sandbags, storing water, and implementing them thoroughly, to fulfill their responsibilities; all our citizens must also strictly abide by the regulations and work tirelessly. Then, even if [enemy] planes use their full strength, even if every bullet hits its target, one bullet can only destroy one empty house, and with many houses and alleys, it is easier to avoid disaster. The [enemy] will not be able to make up for their losses, and we will be free from the suffering of being affected by the disaster. Other cities should also actively implement unified control like the Chongqing urban area, with fixed trenches for avoiding bombs and fixed positions for advancing and retreating, uniformly and neatly arranged, and well-prepared. Those who remain in the city will face less danger; those who go to the countryside will have a place to live and be at peace. They will work together, each in their own position, with no one outside the regulations and no one without a place to work. In the future, [enemy] planes will continue to attack and will concentrate their bombing. If our compatriots can advance and retreat according to all regulations, they will be able to deal with changes as usual and will not suffer unnecessary losses. Governments at all levels must urge the police, officers, soldiers, and all public officials and local 保甲 (bao jia) heads to fully mobilize and perform their duties, so that the order of society will not be adversely affected in the slightest. In this way, the [enemy's] third goal will also be completely crushed by us.

Overall Situation: Victory is Assured

Now, regarding the entire course of the war, I would like to tell our compatriots. Today, the [enemy's] army is at the end of its rope, and the true nature of its desperation is further proven by the 22 months of war. Since the start of the war on July 7th, the [enemy] has used all its strength to try to dominate us, but our army has risen up to resist and has not weakened after a hundred battles. Until now, in the overall situation of the war, in the northern battlefield, our army is still in the northeastern region of Lugouqiao, Tianjin, Chahar, and Suiyuan, continuing to work hard, bravely advancing; in the eastern battlefield, our army is still in the area of Ji, Jing, Hu, and Hang, galloping and traversing, attacking and defending freely; in the southern battlefield, our army is still actively attacking on the Guangjiu and Guangsand lines, repeatedly conquering important towns. And the provincial cities of Kaifeng and Anqing, which have been occupied by the [enemy] for a year, are not only controlled by our army, but have also been captured by our army. In the future, the capture and abandonment of the major towns in the occupied areas will be determined by us. This is a miracle that has never happened in the history of national wars, whether in ancient or modern times, whether in China or abroad. Looking back at the current situation of the [enemy's] army, not only are they deeply mired in the mire and being attacked by our forces, but they are also trapped in our encirclement. The dangerous and difficult situation they are in is not known to outsiders. This is also rare in ancient and modern war history. As for our people's firm will, economic stability, and the factors that lead to victory, I will not mention them for now. Based on the war situation in the past 22 months and the comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of the [enemy] and us, it is sufficient to prove that our country's final victory is assured.

What are [Enemy] Planes Worth?

The only thing that the [enemy] prides itself on in the world is its army, which has been trained for many years, but when it encounters our army's resistance, the record of its progress is only like this. Then, what is the total strength of its air force, which is only about 2,000 aircraft, worth? Therefore, the [enemy's] planes can only attack the cities in our 2,000 counties and cannot destroy the villages in our 90 million households; they can only kill and injure the lives of those who cannot avoid them in time and cannot shake the spirit of hatred of our 450 million compatriots. Since ancient times, the spirit of unyielding integrity of our nation has always been promoted by foreign invasions. History is clear and bright as the sun and stars. The reason why loyal officials and people with lofty ideals face difficulties without being careless and regard death as homecoming is that they all inherit the spirit of this national tradition. From the distant Yangzhou Massacre and the Jiading Massacre to the recent Jinan Massacre on May 3rd and the massacre in Nanjing's inner city, all are recorded in the history of our national spirit in fire and blood. As for the brutality of their air force, it cannot shake the slightest bit of our nation's spirit of resistance, and it is believed that the forging of our national character will be more refined, the unity will be increased, and the foundation of the country will be strengthened. Moreover, we know that the pain caused by the [enemy's] frenzied bombing of our country today will inevitably lead them to drink the bullet of killing themselves. Is the recent retribution not the fact that the [enemy's] military and civilians in the arms factories and chemical factories in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Fukui 千弃 and other places have been continuously and systematically bombed?

If There is a Human Heart, Can One Not Rise Up?

In summary, the [enemy's] act of frenzied bombing everywhere this time is certainly cruel and hateful, and their desperation is evident. Those of our compatriots who are hit by their bullets either have their flesh and blood torn apart, or their homes are destroyed. If there is a human heart, can one not feel compassion? Remembering also that our compatriots in the occupied areas are enslaved and bound by the [enemy] men, and the women are forced and humiliated by the [enemy] army, they rely on the faces of others, weeping in private, as if in a cage, as if in prison, unable to survive and unable to die. All the suffering is many times greater than that of our compatriots under today's air raids. What is even worse is that they force our compatriots to take their poisons and inject their poisonous needles, not only to make us kill ourselves, but also to force us to destroy our race. All the misery suffered by our compatriots is many times greater than the bombing. If we do not unite and seek revenge urgently, how can this irreconcilable hatred comfort our gods? And the local governments of our provinces and cities should follow the central government's regulations, guide the people, implement them conscientiously, and fulfill their responsibilities of rescue to help our compatriots in need and assist our compatriots in what they cannot do. It is hoped that our soldiers and civilians will, from now on, increase their unity, swear to avenge their shame, love each other sincerely, and jointly avenge the country, establish a foundation for the survival, independence, and permanence of our nation! And complete our great mission of resisting aggression and building the country!

### The Shanghai [Japanese] Disregards the Agreement, Disrupts the Rights of the Concession Police: The Municipal Council Sends a Letter to the Consular Body for Attention: Five People Kidnapped in the Concession Have Not Been Released

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 17th] Fan Kelin, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, recently protested to the Consular Body about the Japanese side's indiscriminate arrest of Chinese people in the Concession. He said that this action has clearly infringed on the powers of the Municipal Council and violated the agreement signed between the Japanese army and the Municipal Council, because the agreement stipulates that the Municipal Council police have the right to act independently in the Concession. The Municipal Council did not publish the full text of the protest letter, but published the following announcement: The Director-General of the Municipal Council recently wrote to the leading consul, urging the consular body to pay attention to the incident in which Japanese soldiers and military police arbitrarily arrested five Chinese people at the Fulai Hotel on Guangxi Road on May 9th. This action destroys the agreement established between the Japanese side and the Municipal Council, because the agreement stipulates that the police power of the Municipal Council is completely independent. The Director-General pointed out that the Municipal Council Police Department has worked hard to assist the Japanese side in investigating all actions called terrorist incidents, but in this incident, the Municipal Council was not informed at all, and the arrested persons were not extradited through the Municipal Council Police Station.

### The Arrested Persons are Now Detained in the Japanese Military Police Department

[Shanghai Correspondence] On the afternoon of the 9th, personnel from the Japanese Special Affairs Department (more than a dozen Japanese in plain clothes, two Chinese traitors, all armed) arrested five people directly at the Fulai Jewish Hotel at No. 159 Guangxi Road without notifying the Public Concession Police Department. It is now known that the Japanese side arrested these five people because they suspected that they were secretly planning to launch extensive guerrilla activities in Baoshan and Wusong, which are the bases of the Japanese army and navy. They were carried in three cars bearing the Shanghai Defense Army note to Hongkou and, it is said, have been detained in the Japanese Military Police Headquarters. They are being strictly questioned about their activities. It is now known that the five arrested persons are: (1) Hong Guanghua, executive committee member of the 实山 County Party Department; (2) Wu Yi [character unclear], who previously worked in the Songhu Garrison Headquarters (not Wu Chuiying, but Mr. Wu has also disappeared); (3) Su Liangru, Chief of Staff of the Baoshan Guerrilla; (4) Chen Jiamo, the Baoshan County Magistrate appointed by Chongqing; and (5) Jiang Hao, a Shanghai New Life Guidance Instructor. Among them, four people were arrested in the first batch, and the fifth person was also arrested twenty minutes later. The Japanese authorities apparently wish to maintain silence on this matter, but the Japanese newspapers have praised the "excellent work" of the Army Special Affairs Department personnel in arresting Shanghai's "main anti-Japanese elements." Another report said that it is still unclear where the five people were taken and the reason for their arrest. However, one of the five arrested persons, Jiang Hao, was formerly a Shanghai New Life Movement instructor; another, Wu Chuiying, had previously served locally and, after the fall of his hometown after August 13th, opened the Yida Feng Rice Store in Hejin Road as a partnership for the sake of his family's livelihood, and also engaged in raw silk business on Shanghai's Connaught Road, making a small profit for a living. Another, Hong Guanghua, is now operating the Yuanlong Shipping Company in the Pudong Bank Building on Edouardo Road. The remaining two are said to be Su Liangru and Chen Jiamo.

### Sun Lian Sends Telegram of Commendation to Meritorious Personnel

[Central News Agency, Nanyang, 15th] Vice Commander Sun commended Liu Tingfang, commander of the Anti-[Japanese] Command in a certain district, and Zhu Xuanzhang, administrative commissioner, for their command of the team and regular army, coordinated operations, quick action, and legal defense. On the 14th, he especially commended Zhu and others, hoping that they would continue to lead their troops and cooperate in attacking to achieve complete success.

### Shanghai Groups Protest: Letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Shanghai Dispatch: The Shanghai Groups Joint Office, regarding the incident of five Chinese people being lured and arrested by [Japanese] days ago, sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession on the 13th, saying that it is unknown why the five Chinese people were arrested. Even if there is evidence of guilt, it must go through legal procedures. Today, the Japanese arbitrarily kidnapped people, which is shocking and disregards the police power of the Concession. Not only is the safety of Chinese people's lives not guaranteed, but also the order and security of the Concession are endangered. If this trend is not stopped, the citizens in the Concession will be in danger. A special letter is sent requesting that the Municipal Council be asked to make serious representations to the Japanese side immediately, that the five Chinese people should be released immediately, and that it be guaranteed that the same incident will not happen again in the future.

### National Production Conference: Chairman Chiang's Instructions (2)

First, we must concentrate capital and continue to expand production. Productive enterprises need capital. Today, we want to develop national capital, encourage private capital, and welcome foreign capital to expand wartime production. The enterprises that should be operated by the state have already been planned by the government. For private enterprises, the government has various measures to encourage and subsidize them. Welcoming foreign capital is also a consistent policy of the government. However, in the absence of large-scale foreign investment, we must also work hard ourselves. Many patriotic overseas Chinese have returned to invest in the country, and the government will definitely provide various subsidies and guarantees. However, there are still many entrepreneurs who are hesitant and waiting to see. I hope they understand the principle of "If the skin does not exist, what will the hair adhere to?" and quickly invest useful capital in the construction projects in the rear, so that capital will not be placed in a useless place. At the same time, it will also help the country. This is a great opportunity for entrepreneurs to develop their own businesses and contribute to the country. Entrepreneurs with a long-term vision must not miss it.

Second, today, in the military period, all production must be centered on national defense. You all know that Premier Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan is a national defense plan. Production cannot be separated from national defense, and national defense cannot be separated from production. In all industrially advanced countries, during wartime, all production immediately transforms the peacetime industrial system into a wartime industrial framework. This is called industrial mobilization. Since the War of Resistance, many of our factories have made great efforts for the war effort. This is your glory. However, because of the lack of planning and goals in the past, there are great shortcomings. The畸形 development along the coast has caused great damage to our entire industry. At the same time, we have not paid enough attention to the national defense industry and cannot keep up with the wartime needs. Now, most of the factories have moved to the southwest, and everything has to be started from scratch. But today, time is so urgent. What should we do? We must implement rationalization and adapt to the needs of national defense. Although the methods of our so-called rationalization and adaptation to the needs of national defense are different, the goals are the same, that is, to improve production efficiency.

### Military Council Announces One Week's Battle Situation: Launching a Swift and Fierce Offensive, Repeatedly Capturing Cities, Creating a Brand New Situation on the Entire North-South Battlefield, May 8th to 14th

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] A spokesman for the Military Council stated that since our army launched offensives on all fronts recently, with the momentum of a swift and fierce wind, they have achieved the feat of seizing flags and killing generals. Important towns and famous cities have been repeatedly reported as recovered, creating a brand new and favorable situation on the entire north-south battlefield. In their panic and terror, the enemy has been trying desperately to salvage their defeated remnants this week. However, under our fierce attacks, they have suffered even greater losses. Major battle results are approximately as follows:

Hubei Province

In the Hubei region, the enemy forces of Fujita, Ogisu, and Fujie concentrated all their strength, launching a large-scale offensive with combined land and air forces from last week. After we employed mobile warfare tactics to lure the enemy into the mountainous areas of northern Hubei, completing the encirclement, a major annihilation battle was launched this week. It is estimated that over 2,000 enemies were killed in each of Tumenchong and Yinjadian, over 1,500 near Liujiahe, 3,000 on the left side of Qingtaizhen, over 1,000 in the battle of Liangjiashan, and over 2,000 opposite Xinjié Wanjia Mountain. A total of over 13,800 enemies were killed, and countless weapons and military supplies were seized. Simultaneously, our forces in central Hubei successively captured important locations such as Yangjiaze, Tailiwan, and Wamiaoji, cutting off the enemy's retreat. Our forces in southern Hubei once captured Xianning and Yanglousi, and twice captured Tongcheng. Our forces in eastern Hubei successively captured Echeng Gedian. Near Hankou, our forces also once captured Tuoluokou and Guodishan, taking advantage of the victory to rush into the main roads of Hankou, burning and destroying many supplies and provisions. The enemy in Wuhan is now trembling with fear, preparing day and night, without a moment's rest.

Northern Jiangxi Province

Our various units advancing towards Nanchang have been fiercely attacking the defeated enemy with a posture of converging attacks for several days. Since capturing Shitou, Yaqiuling, and Fenghuang Mountain last week, and killing the enemy commander Suzuki Takayuki and over a thousand enemies, the enemy's offensive was greatly frustrated. We continued to pursue this week, capturing Shajing, Tushan, and Yanshan on the 8th, and approaching Shitoukou Niuxing on the 9th. Although the enemy reinforced and counterattacked, they were all defeated. At dawn on the 11th, we took advantage of the victory to rush into the city, resulting in fierce street fighting. The enemy stubbornly resisted to the death and were killed in large numbers by our gunfire. We also burned and destroyed military and gasoline warehouses, and after burning the barracks, we withdrew. The remnant enemy forces in Fengxin and Anyi are still tightly surrounded by us. The battle to capture the city of Hushan, north of Anyi city, continued fiercely on the evening of the 11th. The enemy between Wuning and Daqiaohe has been severely attacked for the past three days, with over 600 enemy casualties. The situation is now gradually calming down. On the 8th and 9th, a unit of our elite troops adopted miraculous tactics to launch a surprise attack on Pengze in order to coordinate. After two days and one night of bloody fighting, we successfully captured the two important points of Dingshan and Yangjiashan, approaching the city, making the enemy forces in Puchang, Wuning, Fengxin, and Anyi overwhelmed, panicked and at a loss.

Guangdong Province

Our army, operating in the suburbs of Zizhou, launched a rapid offensive with large units against the enemy besieged in the city starting on the 8th. The enemy stubbornly resisted in separate locations, suffering heavy casualties. On the morning of the 12th, they launched a surprise attack from Jiangcun towards Liuhua Bridge in the north of the city. The enemy was caught off guard and hurriedly responded. Our surprise troops circled behind the enemy and opened fire, killing over 600 enemies. The vanguard has now approached the city gates and is launching a fierce attack. The enemy forces in Zengcheng advanced towards Xiaolou on the 9th, but after a head-on attack, the enemy abandoned over 300 corpses and fled in disarray. All highway bridges between Zengcheng and Conghua have also been completely destroyed, cutting off enemy communication. Another unit of surprise troops took advantage of the situation to capture Fuhe, annihilating all 300 defending enemies. As for the enemy in Xinhui Jiangmen, on the morning of the 11th, our army, leading local armed forces, launched a three-pronged attack. The enemy desperately resisted but, after fierce fighting until noon, abandoned the city and fled. It was recaptured once again. In addition, over 500 enemies in Jiujiang, on the 10th, attempted to harass Yangbu from the southwest, encountering our attacking troops. After three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy abandoned over 200 corpses and retreated in disarray. We pursued them closely, capturing many.

Henan Province

Our army, which recaptured Meng County in northern Henan, has been advancing towards Wen County in the past few days, engaging in fierce battles with the enemy in the suburbs. Many were killed. On the 9th, the enemy forces in the city attempted to break through the north gate and flee, but they failed. We are continuing to encircle and annihilate them. Over 2,000 enemies in Bo'ai advanced towards Qiao Guo Fan Factory on the same day. After a courageous counterattack, we killed the enemy detachment commander Yamamoto and over 800 others. The traffic along the Daoqing line is now completely under our control, causing the remnant enemy forces in Xinyang, southern Henan, to be unable to cross the You River despite several attempts to break through to the west. Their strength is exhausted. However, starting on the 10th, enemies from Xinye, Tanghe, and Tongbai have ventured deep, attacking from various directions. Our officers and soldiers displayed great courage, encircling the enemy in each location and fiercely attacking them. In the battle of Xinye, over 1,000 enemies were killed. In the battle of Tanghe, 900 enemies were killed. Both of the above county towns have been lost and regained, enhancing our prestige. The enemy forces harassing the outskirts of Tongbai suffered countless casualties under our fierce artillery fire after a day-long battle on the 14th. Their attempt to attack our flank and echo the defeated enemy in northern Hubei has been completely crushed by this strong blow.

In addition

We recaptured Pizhou in northern Jiangsu, penetrated Andu in Anhui, attacked Qingyang, captured Dachen Fort in Suiyuan, pressed close to the suburbs of Lishi in western Shanxi, and successively captured Linqing and Feixian in Shandong. Due to our overall victory, puppet troops in various locations seized the opportunity to revolt and jointly kill the enemy in an endless stream. Important examples include the former puppet Security Corps in northern Hebei, led by Qiao Richeng, with over 1,300 men; the former puppet Imperial Army in Yongji, led by Xu Beizhai, with over 500 men; the former puppet Imperial Army in Linjin, led by Fan Dingbang, with over 800 men; the former puppet National Salvation Army in Hong County, led by Liu Yuchun, with over 200 men; and the former puppet Self-Government Army in Ji County, led by Li Zhonglin, with over 300 men. The total number is no less than 3,000 men, causing the enemy's treacherous scheme of using Chinese to control Chinese to increasingly fail. These are all major battle results in the past week and are worth a special report.

### Fierce Battles in Central Hubei and Southern Henan for Two Weeks; We Hold the Advantage in Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Northern Hunan

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th] Yicheng dispatch: The enemy's offensive from central Hubei and southern Henan has been thwarted after two weeks of bloody battles. We have recaptured Tanghe and are now continuing fierce battles with the enemy south of Tanghe and north of Suizhou and Zaoyang, as well as in the Changshoudian area north of Zhongxiang.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] According to military observers, it is still impossible to predict the changes in the Central China War, but due to the fierce resistance of the Chinese army on both sides of the Han River, the Japanese army has been unable to defend the Hanyi Highway. The current intention of the Japanese army seems to be to cut off the communication between the Chinese army and the rear, but so far it has not succeeded. The Japanese army seems to have advanced west from Sui County to the Han River, and then advanced along the east bank of the Han River in two routes, north and south respectively. The purpose of the northern army is to capture Yicheng and attack Xiangyang, and to unite with the Japanese army descending south to Tongbai in southern Henan to encircle the Chinese army in Xiangyang, Yingshan, and Sui County. According to one source, the Japanese army has reached Yicheng, but this has not been confirmed. As for the southern Japanese army, the purpose is highly anticipated after the Chinese army recovered Huamiaozhi near Zaoshi. Another route of the Japanese army descended south to Xiangyang via Xinye in southern Henan. It is said that Xinye was once lost, but it was soon recaptured by the Chinese army. The two armies are now holding each other fifty kilometers east of Xinye. Another attempt by the Japanese army is to disperse the strength of the Chinese army in the area, one in Yingshan and one in Xiangyang, and then slowly advance into Xiangyang, but the Chinese army is now prepared to deal with this plan. The fierce battle that occurred in Sui County recently is enough to show that the combat achievements of the Chinese army are admired by everyone. Because the number of Japanese troops is not large, the strength of the two armies is almost equal. It is heard that the Japanese army has decided to use bombing as a way to win, but what the result will be is unpredictable. The Chinese side also denies the Japanese propaganda on Qingbo Terrace, saying that the rumors that the Chinese army suffered heavy casualties are false.

[Our Newspaper, Guilin, 15th Special Dispatch] There are no major battles currently in Guangdong, Jiangxi, and northern Hunan. We hold the advantage in local skirmishes.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th] Shaanxi dispatch: The battle situation is calm. Along the Tongpu and Zhengtai lines, our guerrillas have recently launched several attacks on the enemy, achieving minor victories.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 15th Special Dispatch] Shandong dispatch: The enemy in Shandong is still guarding various transportation points. In local guerrilla warfare, we have killed over a thousand enemies in the past half month. The Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways are often destroyed by us.

### Su Zhichang's Reply: Adhering to Original Position; Advocating the Signing of a Tripartite Mutual Assistance Agreement; Granting Small Countries an Anti-Aggression Guarantee; Door to Negotiations Not Closed, Britain May Concede

(Haitong News Agency, London, 16th) According to political circles here, the Soviet Union's reply to Britain's proposal contains three points of Soviet objection:

(1) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should sign a mutual assistance agreement.

(2) The military staff of the three countries should confer and establish detailed measures for a tripartite military agreement.

(3) All small countries along the Baltic Sea should be granted guarantees because, without this, the Soviet border there lacks protection and is insufficient to resist aggression.

[Reuters, London, 15th] The Soviet Union's reply to the British government's proposal has been delivered to London and is now being translated. Foreign Secretary Halifax and experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will study it on Tuesday and it is expected to be presented to the Cabinet for discussion on Wednesday.

[Reuters, London, 16th] It is learned that the British government's reply to the recent Soviet document will be delivered to Moscow before the Geneva Conference. The Soviet proposal has been closely reviewed by the British government.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 15th] The Soviet Foreign Minister delivered the Soviet government's reply to the British government to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union at midnight tonight. The Soviet Foreign Minister and the British Ambassador met for about half an hour, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. According to authoritative sources, the Soviet Union has expressed its inability to accept the British government's proposal, believing that the British government's proposal is not thorough and still maintains its original position. It is learned that the Soviet government's document to the British government insists on the establishment of a tripartite mutual assistance agreement and the provision of anti-aggression guarantees to the Baltic and Black Sea regions by the three countries. This is the main condition for cooperation between the Soviet Union and Western European countries. In addition, Izvestia also published an editorial today, unreservedly approving the agreement between Britain and Turkey, believing that this move can strengthen the defense of the Black Sea region without causing the Soviet Union to accept any restrictions, which is naturally welcomed by the Soviet Union.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 16th] Informed sources hope that the British and French Foreign Ministers can reach an agreement in the Geneva negotiations, and it is expected that Britain will make concessions. If an agreement cannot be reached, British Prime Minister Chamberlain's prestige at home will be affected. It is heard that when the House of Commons' foreign policy debate is held on Friday, opposition members will express their opinions.

[Reuters, London, 15th] During the meeting of the House of Commons today, various questions were raised regarding the British-Soviet negotiations. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that he is currently awaiting a document from the Soviet side, so he has nothing to add to what he announced to Parliament the other day. He further said that Foreign Secretary Halifax hopes to have the opportunity to meet with the Soviet representative attending the Geneva Conference to advance the British-Soviet negotiations. Mr. Zhang also insisted on his original position when answering some ancillary questions, saying that it is not appropriate to announce too much about the British-Soviet negotiations at this time, so he refused to express further opinions.

[Central News Agency, London, 16th] A member of the House of Commons yesterday asked Undersecretary Butler what obligations Britain has to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and whether the British government has an obligation to assist the Soviet Union if the Soviet Union is drawn into a war to defend any of these three countries. The Undersecretary replied that Britain has no obligations to these three countries other than those stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant.

League of Nations General Assembly Approaching; Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to Confer; Soviet Ambassador to Britain Appointed to Attend

[Central News Agency, London, 15th] Regarding the organization of an anti-aggression group, diplomatic circles here recently stated that although the Soviet government has de facto rejected the British proposal and insisted on its original position, this is not the country's final attitude. When the League of Nations Administrative Council meets on the 22nd of this month, the British and French Foreign Ministers and the Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar, Bo Danjin, will continue to confer, and it is certain that some achievements will be made at that time. In addition, the French government's proposal is closer to the Soviet Union's position, making it possible to establish a compromise.

[Central News Agency, London, 17th] The League of Nations Administrative Council has postponed its meeting to the 22nd of this month at the request of the Soviet government. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax is scheduled to travel to Paris by plane on the 20th of this month to hold talks with Daladier and Bonet.

[Reuters, Geneva, 16th] It is learned that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has appointed Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky to represent the Soviet Union at next week's League of Nations meeting. According to general sources, Soviet Vice Foreign Commissar Bo Danjin will be selected to attend the international conference and will hold talks with Halifax and Bonet.

### Nazi Farce: "Reclaim Our Colonies"

[Reuters, Vienna, 16th] A three-day event on colonies begins here today, with the slogan "Reclaim Our Colonies." The German Colonial Conference opened here today, with 30,000 participants, including former colonial governors and administrators. Tomorrow's program will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the East African and Southwest African colonial armies. Today, the streets of Vienna are filled with people over the age of fifty, wearing gray uniforms and wearing wide-brimmed hats of the former colonial army. In front of the hall where the Colonial Conference is held, there is a black map of Africa.

### Rumors That Hitler Will Issue a Strong Statement; Opposing Democratic Countries; Italian King and Yugoslavian Regent Both to Visit Germany

[Associated Press, Berlin, 16th] According to unconfirmed reports here, Hitler is preparing to issue a strong statement opposing Britain, France, and other countries. The report also claims that Hitler is also preparing to recall envoys to countries that accept British guarantees and other countries that align with democratic countries.

[Reuters, Istanbul, 16th] It is reported that German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen is now heading to Berlin, and it is rumored that he will report to Hitler on the situation after the establishment of the British-Turkish agreement and the possible impact of the agreement on future German-Turkish relations.

[Reuters, Berlin, 10th] Italian Foreign Minister Ciano will arrive in Berlin on Sunday and is expected to sign a German-Italian military alliance on Monday.

### Britain Strives to Promote Sino-British Trade; Undersecretary Answers Questions on the Yuanle Issue; Warning Issued Regarding Japanese Bombing of Chongqing

[Reuters, London, 15th] In the House of Commons today, there was an inquiry as to where the British Ambassador to China, Kerr, had decided to locate the permanent embassy. Undersecretary Butler replied that the Ambassador believed that Shanghai was the most suitable place to maintain close contact with British interests, because Shanghai can take care of all parties and can visit the Chinese government in Chongqing from time to time, and can also inspect other locations with British consulates such as Peiping. Sir Milner, a Conservative member, requested a report on the seizure of the British ship Xigasi by the Japanese. Butler replied that the government had sent a note to the Japanese government regarding this matter and is now awaiting its reply, and stated that the ship is still in Japanese hands. When asked if there was a way to get the Japanese to return the ship, the Undersecretary replied that he would investigate the matter. Labor member Baker then asked if the Undersecretary had received reports regarding Japan building a submarine base in Yulin Port. The Undersecretary replied that he had received such reports, but they had never been officially confirmed; Baker then asked if the government could instruct local representatives to investigate the matter. Butler said that the government is in the process of investigating whether this report is true. The Labour MP Henderson then raised the issue of methods of warfare, asking whether the British government could jointly send a note to Japan with other countries regarding Japan's barbaric bombing of Chongqing, urging them to stop this kind of atrocity. Butler replied that the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, had already issued a serious warning to the Tokyo government, stating that for the sake of human morality and Japan's own interests, it should instruct its air force to limit attacks to military targets. Ambassador Craigie observed that the victims of the Japanese air raid on Chongqing were almost all innocent civilians. According to Foreign Secretary Halifax, other ambassadors have also submitted similar notes to Japan. Mr. Henderson then said, "Can the League of Nations Administrative Council consider this matter and pass a resolution similar to the one passed by the General Assembly last September?" Butler replied that he would consider the matter, but there must be an initiator. Labour MP Sorensen then asked whether a reply had been received from the Japanese government. Parlett replied that there was, but it was not particularly related to this matter. Conservative Senator Bushby asked, "Regarding the safety of the British Embassy, ​​are there any special measures to be taken?" The Undersecretary replied that in the note to Japan, it was stated that the British Embassy was almost hit during the Japanese air raid on Chongqing. It was then asked whether the government had taken note of the fact that although the Japanese army had occupied several Chinese cities, the Chinese government was still able to promote the prosperity of industry in its provinces. Overseas Trade Department Undersecretary Cross replied that the government was well aware of this fact. It was then requested to explain what steps the British government had taken to promote the full cooperation between the British industrial community and the construction of this new China. Cross replied that the British government had done its best to assist all merchants who were willing to cooperate with China. Regarding the Japanese propaganda of anti-British movements in the occupied areas, Butler said that the British Consul General in Shanghai had negotiated with the Japanese on the spot. According to the Consul General's report, the anti-British propaganda has been reduced slightly, but it is still closely monitored, and protests will still be lodged with Japan if necessary. Undersecretary of the Department of India and Burma Movenheit replied regarding the road from Burma to China, saying that the government spent less than £28,000 on building the road, and all were taken from Burmese taxes. It was then asked whether serious consideration would be given to the defense of Burma in order to stop excessive Chinese immigration. He said that there was no need for this at present.

Brief Commentary

### Protests by Compatriots in Shanghai

The compatriots in Shanghai ultimately possess backbone and courage. They are adept at adapting to the environment, carrying out all patriotic and national salvation work to support the war of resistance, and are skilled at striving for justice and freedom amidst hardship and danger with a spirit of great fearlessness. For example, in this instance, under the unreasonable threats of the Japanese, the authorities of the concessions adopted a policy of yielding. The compatriots in Shanghai, on the one hand, resolutely strengthened and expanded the anti-Japanese movement, and on the other hand, protested the humiliating policies of the concession authorities in the most appropriate manner, speaking with justice and confidence (see Central News Agency's dispatch of the 15th, "Japanese Arbitrarily Kidnap in Concessions, Shanghai Groups Jointly Protest"). Although the issue of the concessions can only be fundamentally resolved with the concrete implementation of sanctions against Japan by Britain, the United States, and France, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, has already protested to the Consular Body about the recent atrocities of the Japanese military in the concessions!

This spirit of arduous struggle among the compatriots in Shanghai is a manifestation of the great character of the Chinese nation and is also the foundation upon which the Chinese nation will ultimately defeat its *enemy*. However, those who are in a much better situation than Shanghai, *[text missing]*, and who take self-deprecation and self-humiliation as a source of joy, should feel ashamed when they see the words "citizens of the Republic of China!"

Does righteousness only reside in the compatriots in Shanghai? Are blood and backbone only bestowed upon the compatriots in Shanghai? *[text missing]*, can those who find themselves amidst evil and demonic forces learn to strive forward because of the compatriots in Shanghai?

### Intensify Efforts to Secure Foreign Aid!

The recent intimidation and adventurism of the Japanese *[text missing]* in the Far East primarily affect the democratic and peace-loving nations that have significant interests in the Far East, especially Britain. As long as the Japanese *[text missing]* continue their policy of aggression for one day, the contradictions between them and Britain, France, and the United States will intensify day by day.

Under these circumstances, we must firmly seize every opportunity to promote the movement in Britain, France, and the United States to aid China and sanction Japan!

On the 15th, the British House of Commons reopened the debate on the situation in the Far East. This debate not only reflected the enthusiasm of the entire British public to resist the Japanese *[text missing]* but also more clearly and intensely expressed the enthusiasm of those in positions of political authority to aid China and sanction Japan. The British Secretary of Commerce also solemnly stated that the British government is determined to support Sino-British industrial cooperation.

This situation is, of course, not only the case in Britain—according to a Reuters dispatch from London on the 17th, it is also said that political circles in Britain believe that the League of Nations conference will likely pass proposals for further assistance to China!

However, where are our efforts? Where is our national diplomatic movement? Where is the mobilization of our public opinion circles? As the war of resistance and national construction face a new and difficult stage, we must quickly unite, support the government, seize opportunities, and strive for foreign aid to complement the progress of domestic military, political, and economic construction, and inflict a greater and more fatal blow on the Japanese *[text missing]*!

### Preparing for a Rainy Day: British Resident Registration to Be Completed by the End of the Month; Chinese Registration to Be Implemented During the Day; British Registration Already Seventy to Eighty Percent Complete, Many are Specialized Technical Personnel; Three New British Warships Arrive in Hong Kong to Increase Defenses, Aircraft Carrier to Return to Hong Kong Within Days

The Hong Kong authorities, due to the unstable current situation, are taking precautions. In order to prepare for a rainy day, in addition to strengthening Hong Kong's naval, land, and air defenses, they are also implementing British registration and voluntary Chinese registration, so that in case of need, sufficient personnel can be provided. British registration has already begun and is scheduled to end on the 31st of this month. The Hong Kong government attaches great importance to this matter. Since the start of the registration, notices have been published in Western newspapers and advertisements have been displayed on trams and buses, advising British residents to complete registration within two weeks. Yesterday, the authorities again displayed advertisements on trams and buses, stating that the 31st of this month is the deadline for registration, and those who have not yet registered should do so as soon as possible and not wait any longer. In recent days, there has been a very enthusiastic response from British residents to register. As of recently, seventy to eighty percent of the British residents in Hong Kong have registered, and the remaining twenty to thirty percent are expected to register before the 31st of this month. Many of the registered British residents are technical personnel, especially those skilled in general mechanics and wireless technology. It is said that the authorities intend to summon each registered person for an interview after the registration is completed to test whether the information reported on the registration form is accurate, in preparation for future needs. Furthermore, dozens of the British residents who have registered this time participated in various aspects of the European War of 1914 to 1918, and several even participated in frontline work in France. As for the voluntary registration of Chinese, all forms and booklets have now been printed and will begin during the day, without waiting for the British registration to be completed before proceeding. In addition, in order to strengthen Hong Kong's defense capabilities, the British Admiralty has dispatched a new minelayer and two river gunboats to Hong Kong. The three ships are scheduled to arrive by the end of the month. The minelayer is the latest type, weighing 498 tons, named HMS Clide, and the gunboats are also newly equipped, one named Dragonfly and one named Gadfly, each weighing 585 tons and equipped with 4-inch guns, each with 74 sailors. In addition, the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle, after going to Singapore for exercises last year, entered the Singapore dry dock for repairs and has now been completed. It will leave Singapore and return to Hong Kong within a few days, escorted by the HMS Courageous. Also, when the HMS Gadfly was en route to Hong Kong, it encountered the East Asia Steamship Company's 4,812-ton mail ship SS Alesia, which sails between Singapore and Europe, and the ship caught fire. HMS Gadfly immediately sailed to rescue the ship. At the same time, the P&O ship SS Canton, which was also in port bound for Europe, joined the rescue efforts, and the two ships together rescued more than one hundred passengers and crew members. The details of the ship's fire are currently unknown.

### Bloody Fight in Ap Lei Chau; Police Investigate Strictly; More Than Ten Detectives Were Dispatched to the Scene of the Incident Yesterday to Inquire; Scavenger Xiao Cai's Injury Worsens and His Life Is in Danger

A bloody and tragic incident of brutal fighting occurred in Ap Lei Chau, Aberdeen, at around 2:00 PM yesterday, the 15th. The details of the incident were reported in yesterday's newspapers. After the incident occurred, the police authorities, believing that such a brutal and bloody tragedy should not be allowed to occur in a region governed by the rule of law in Hong Kong, dispatched more than ten detectives to the Dat Shu Wan area of Ap Lei Chau yesterday morning to strictly investigate the origin of the tragedy. Once evidence of the incident is found, those who have been detained will be charged. It was found that Xiao Cai, a sanitation worker from the Cleansing Bureau, deeply concerned that a bloody tragedy would occur due to the willingness of both sides to engage in private fighting, stepped forward to act as a peacemaker, hoping to resolve the conflict into goodwill. However, like the fire at the city gate affecting the fishpond, he was struck in the abdomen by a wooden stick wielded by one of the fighting parties, causing serious injury on the spot. He was immediately taken to the Matilda Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of the injury to his abdomen, treatment was difficult. His spirit had not changed much in the morning, but by the afternoon, his condition worsened, and his life is now in danger. In addition to the death of Liu Qiu, one of the injured, a total of eight people were injured in the fight. Xiao Cai suffered the most severe injury. If he does not receive treatment, it will turn into a tragic incident of two deaths and seven injuries. Furthermore, it was found that the bloody fight was between Hakka people from Huizhou who grow vegetables in Dat Shu Wan (south of Ap Lei Chau) and Cantonese shipbuilding workers from the Ho Hing Shipyard in Ap Lei Chau. Although nearly a thousand people from Xiamen live in Ap Lei Chau, they did not participate in the fight.

### Hong Kong and British Territories Discuss Establishing Wireless Telephone

Wireless telephone is an essential tool for modern communication. Therefore, major cities in various countries have this equipment. Major cities in the Far East have also joined the wireless telephone communication network one after another. Singapore will start establishing a wireless telephone line from Singapore to North America on June 1st. After that, Hong Kong is the only major commercial port in the Far East that does not have this equipment. The wireless telephone in Japan has already established contact with various countries in the world, and Shanghai could communicate with North America and Europe before the war. Manila and Batavia have direct connections to the United States and the Netherlands. However, Hong Kong is uniquely lacking. Recognizing this, the Wireless and Wired Telegraph Company has begun discussions with the Hong Kong authorities and the British government to establish a wireless telephone communication network between Hong Kong and the territories of the British Empire.

### Responding to the Spirit of General Mobilization: National Oath in Macau

By—Huan Tang

Feature Article

The beacon fire of the *Incident* has awakened the sleeping lion of centuries. The angry tide of national defense and resistance has surged up in the blue sky. Every filial son and virtuous grandson of the Chinese people is striving for national independence and survival, and is passionately moving toward justice. They have all directly or indirectly devoted their loyalty and prepared to sacrifice everything for the sacred war.

Now, the War of Resistance has entered a favorable new stage. In order to cope with and realize this difficult transitional period and approach the final victory and the free and happy world, the Chinese nation, under the leadership of the supreme leader Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, is launching a general mobilization of the national spirit. The spirit combined with matter—it is an even more powerful torrent in China's future war of resistance. This torrent will spread from South China *[sic]* and West China to East China and North China, flowing across the Yalu River and rushing to Mount Fuji.

Macau—because of its special political relationship, it can be considered a safe zone in South China *[sic]* after the outbreak of the war. However, the emotions of the overseas Chinese have, fortunately, not been completely tainted by safety and buried their innocent hearts. They have contributed considerable spiritual and material resources to their motherland in the past, and the motherland, of course, also feels a sense of comfort for this orphan overseas.

Here, the Four Circles Relief Association is one of the representatives. Now, in order to respond to the national spirit mobilization, it specially held a national covenant oath on the seaside of the Bay on the other day, the Bay Elementary School. After the association members rushed to take care of it beforehand, hundreds of people who came to the scene on the day were students, members of the association, and overseas Chinese in Macau. The economic situation was overwhelming. This group of the motherland is the epitome of the political progress of the Chinese nation and a powerful cornerstone for winning the final victory.

In a small school with a low and high *[sic]* that is arranged *[sic]*, in front of the door is a white forehead with red characters, the virtue is that the old locust with a few skills in front of the land, the red and green reflect the swaying spring breeze. Sitting in the hall is a group of excellent and promising young men and women, orderly and silent. After the ceremony, the chairman announced the reasons for the meeting. Then, the representative of the Macau Direct Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang, the supervisor, delivered a speech. Then, representatives from all walks of life gave speeches, each with emotional words, inspiring meaning, and the hearts of the people were really alienated from the shell of the body, and they had already galloped to the suffering motherland. In *[sic]* and solemn *[sic]* air, in order to exhaust loyalty and protect the motherland, the national covenant began to be sworn in.

Everyone in the venue stood up, raised their right hand, and the chairman first read out the oath, followed by chanting the covenant. Everyone spoke in unison, and the sound was like gold and stone. Finally, representatives from all walks of life wielded their pens on the spot and jointly judged the judgment—the final victory of the Chinese nation is indeed a powerful guarantee.

In the evening, the comrades of the association still had unfinished business "There, they held a wildfire conference. In an open space surrounded by thousands of people, a group of young men and women were preparing to express meaningful texts in action and promote the great meaning of the War of Resistance. There are the Singing Arts Corps, including the exiled 1, 2, and 3, and the Sacrifice is at the Final Moment, and the National Salvation March. There are performances by the Rise Children's Troupe of "××××" and "××××." The Youth Service Corps's "Northeast Roar," "Qiluo Music," and "Our Hometown." Among them, especially "Northeast Roar" is about saving people's provinces, mobilizing *[sic]*. At that time, the atmosphere of the whole field was silent. Perhaps the emotions of the audience were too deeply stimulated. It was not until about eleven o'clock in the middle of the night that a group of comrades hugged their strong hearts and left the meeting and returned.

Our newspaper's special feature

### Model of a Salvation Organization: The Organization and Life of "Zhong Jiu"

— Qi Zhuo

Strict, solemn, dedicating everything to the national liberation struggle!

The China Salvation Drama Troupe should be familiar to readers.

They closely follow the salutes of the national liberation struggle, running east, west, south, and north, inspiring countless soldiers on the front lines and compatriots in the rear!

They will go to Southeast Asia to comfort overseas Chinese compatriots. They will use concrete evidence from within the country to prove that final victory is absolutely guaranteed, and that the efforts and contributions of overseas Chinese in the past will not be in vain. They will also raise five hundred thousand yuan to establish twenty stations for wounded soldiers, ten hospitals for wounded soldiers—along with cultural supply stations; and ten vocational training centers for disabled soldiers, families of fallen soldiers, and families of soldiers on the expedition.

They, at the invitation of various charities in Hong Kong, will give a large-scale charity performance before going abroad for these purposes. Starting on the 25th of this month, they will perform famous plays such as "Defend the Motherland," "National Immortality," and "Spring of Taierzhuang" for three consecutive nights at the Lee Theatre. The scenery and lighting will be handled by "Zhong Jiu," costing over three thousand Hong Kong dollars, an unprecedented event in Hong Kong.

The newspaper has already reported on these matters in detail. What is to be introduced here is the organization and life of the China Salvation Drama Troupe.

Based on the spirit of democracy, the general assembly is the highest authority, meeting once a week. The board of directors is the executive body and also meets once a week. The organization and personnel under the board of directors are: Group Leader Jin Shan, Deputy Group Leader Wang Ying, Secretary and Head of Research Department Zhi Wei, Head of General Affairs Department Bai _, Head of Drama Department Liu Danqing, Head of Publicity Department Wu He, and Head of Film Department Xu _ Shan. The board of directors consists of seven members, including the group leader and deputy group leader, and the heads of each department. The group leader serves as chairman. The general affairs department includes accounting, administration, documentation, and hygiene sections. The drama department includes props, costumes, makeup, prompting, lighting, set design, and effects sections. The publicity department includes an editorial committee (three members) and liaison, art, and publication sections. The research department includes collection, current affairs, investigation, study, and practice sections. The film department includes photography, developing, printing, and storage sections. Each department also has several secretaries to assist in everything, making every effort to apply the principle of division of labor and cooperation so that everyone has something to do. Looking back, general groups are not also "customarily" similarly organized, but "it depends on the people" and the effect is different.

What kind of talent makes up "Zhong Jiu?" Readers will surely immediately recall Jin Shan, Wang Ying, Lin Shu, and Fan Zheng. Yes, these four symbolize the meaning of the entire people, regardless of gender or age, fighting against the war. (Although Mr. Lin Shu is not old, based on his experience and age, he is clearly an elder in the group, and it is not inappropriate to call him "Old Dan.") However, the other companions are all shrewd, capable, and versatile specialized talents. The reporter saw some of them installing electrical appliances, some filming, some making scenery and props, and some drafting manuscripts and writing articles... a group of capable people, all indispensable talents for the group.

Regarding their lifestyle, the group's expenses are donated by government officials and close friends who sympathize with them. Each person receives only three yuan per month for pocket money. If the group's finances are difficult, they may even receive a discount or "unpaid salary." They do everything themselves, and they even take turns cooking. This kind of enjoyment is completely opposite to their past lives as stars or university students; however, they have been influenced by the brave soldiers and the vast number of compatriots, and they deeply feel that this kind of life is the "Chinese" life, a life with life and soul, and also symbolizes the glorious future of the Chinese nation. The sudden change in lifestyle among the petty bourgeoisie and intellectuals, and the overcoming of inferior habits, is a praiseworthy phenomenon of progress since the war of resistance. The "Zhong Jiu" friends are a part of the many progressive young people.

Their daily life: from 7:00 to 7:30 is morning assembly, which includes current affairs reports, reading reports, life reviews, and work assignments. This is followed by reading and group discussions. After lunch, they work in the office and rehearse plays. The evening is for free creative work. Unless it is Sunday, members cannot leave the group. Now, because they are busy preparing for the public performance, even Sundays have been canceled. Whether at the front line or in Hong Kong, they are always working collectively and receiving collective education.

Their group has three rules: (1) Only collective action, no individual action, sharing life and death, joy and sorrow; (2) Absolute transparency in all internal and external affairs; (3) Refusal of all public and private banquets unrelated to work. There are also four maxims: intense work, strict life, clear finances, and pure attitude.

The reporter carefully observed their lives and deeply felt that these covenants and creeds are fully expressed in their actual lives. When they are at morning assembly, unnecessary chatter is set aside. Everyone practices Mandarin and learns phonetic symbols with the same spirit as primary and middle school students. Even Mr. Lin Shu follows the "youngsters" in practicing to correct his incorrect pronunciation, talking and laughing, harmoniously and happily, truly making onlookers envious.

Usually, Group Leader Jin Shan is just like everyone else, and everyone calls him "Old Jin"—"Old Jin"—but when reciting lines or rehearsing a play, if there is something wrong, he very seriously tells his partners, with a very serious and natural attitude. Everyone also politely asks him for advice when they encounter problems, with genuine feelings flowing between them.

Yesterday evening, the reporter saw how loving and sincere they were while putting on makeup, taking photos, and setting up the backstage. Some were braving the heavy rain to fetch clothes from the dormitory, putting public affairs on their shoulders. Putting on makeup, I help you, you help me, the matter is everyone's. Because they were taking photos all night, tired friends would lie down anywhere. Passing friends, afraid that they would catch a cold, would cover them with two pieces of clothing. Sharing the same boat, they were even closer than siblings. The reporter has seen many groups, but rarely one like "Zhong Jiu." After happily reporting to readers, at the end of this article, I wish young friends to learn from their example; may they cherish themselves for the country and work hard; and may they grow up well.

### Expanding Publicity for the Provincial Games, Promoting People's Armed Self-Defense; Various Counties and Cities Organize Publicity and Political Training Work Groups; Conducting Mass Training to Strengthen the Spirit of Struggle

(Qujiang Express) After the Japanese bandits extended their claws into South China, every Guangdong compatriot must earnestly take responsibility for protecting their homes and villages. In the occupied areas, especially, we must rise up to fight back. The Guangdong Provincial Games, in order to firmly establish the people's belief in "inevitable victory in the war of resistance," strengthen the people's spirit of sacrifice and struggle, launch a people's armed movement, resist the Japanese bandits, and defend our homeland, will engage in mobilizing all party members and the masses to assist the province's self-defense corps in publicity and political training work. In various counties and cities, they will organize mass anti-Japanese self-defense corps publicity and training work groups to take charge of mobilization. The steps for implementation are as follows:

Publicity Aspects

A. Mobilizing and Organizing: 1. Contact and summon various work teams in the county or stationed in the county to discuss and determine publicity methods, publicity locations, team assignments, and departure dates, and separately carry out publicity in the villages. 2. Contact local middle schools to organize students or enthusiastic intellectual youths into several publicity teams, with five to seven people per team, to regularly depart for rural areas on holidays for publicity. 3. Contact local primary and secondary school teachers and students to organize visiting groups, with three to five people per group, to regularly visit ordinary households and gentry and wealthy families on holidays for publicity and guidance. B. Preparing Materials: 1. Simple maps and photos of Japanese bandits committing atrocities. 2. Simple leaflets and popular wall newspapers. 3. Photos of guerrillas and all heroic sacrifices related to the war of resistance. 4. The above photos can be collected from local schools or drawn by school students. C. Utilizing Opportunities: 1. Utilize gatherings to invite local enthusiastic celebrities and scholars to give speeches. 2. Utilize village gatherings and temple festivals to assign publicity teams to depart for publicity. 3. Utilize welcome rallies for soldiers on expeditions to expand publicity. 4. Utilize other institutions to launch publicity anytime, anywhere. D. Publicity Methods: Should be adapted to the times and to the people, utilizing various publicity methods. 1. Adapting to the People: For example, use storytelling methods for women and children, discuss business management methods for merchants, and discuss improved farming and rural life methods for farmers, etc. 2. Adapting to the Times: For example, in spring publicity, you can use lion dances to summon the masses. In summer, you can use evening concerts or singing to summon the masses. Other methods suitable for local customs and practices can be determined independently. 3. Lecture or educational style gatherings are both acceptable.

Training Methods

A. Mass Training: 1. Holding Self-Defense Publicity Classes: 1. Supported by principals or head teachers of senior primary schools, in conjunction with township chiefs and district leaders, holding self-defense publicity classes. 2. Each public or private primary school in famous villages must hold one self-defense publicity class and must regularly and continuously operate it. 3. Each self-defense publicity class is limited to sixty to eighty people. 4. The training period for each self-defense publicity class is limited to two weeks, with training hours limited to 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM daily. However, this can be changed according to local conditions. 5. Each village and school should hold two self-defense publicity classes each month, and at least twenty classes per year, and must continue to hold them until all out-of-school men, women, young and old in the village have completed training. 6. The methods and teaching materials for the self-defense publicity classes will be ordered and distributed by the provincial capital. 2. Holding Night Meetings: 1. Presided over by township chiefs, in conjunction with primary school teachers in the township, holding village night meetings. 2. Night meetings should be held on the fifteenth night of each lunar month. 3. The purpose of holding night meetings is to publicize people's efforts in self-defense and resistance, contributing money, guns, and labor, and to narrate war conditions in various places and add recreational activities. 4. Night meeting speakers can be pre-arranged, or the township chief and primary school teachers can be responsible. 5. The night meeting location can be temporarily designated, or rotated between districts for comprehensive coverage. B. Self-Defense Corps Training: 1. The county (city) publicity and training corps, in conjunction with self-defense corps leaders, determine the political training lesson time. The political training content is divided into literacy lessons and political training lessons, two subjects. 2. The county (city) publicity and training corps should send letters to local primary and secondary school staff, teachers, party department workers, heads of institutions, and enthusiastic intellectuals to separately teach the self-defense corps political training lessons, each person taking one to two hours per week. 3. Send a letter to the local middle school student union to send high-achieving students to teach self-defense corps literacy lessons. The Three Principles of the People literacy textbook can be used. 4. The county (city) publicity and training corps should consult with the self-defense corps leaders to set up a library and reading room in the self-defense corps headquarters. The materials and reading materials will be collected by the publicity and training corps. 5. Political training in the self-defense corps must be carried out regularly. However, if the number of people is too large, they can be divided into teams for rotation training, with one term every three months.

### Guangdong Northern Journalists' Association is About to be Established; Personnel are Being Sent to Prepare

[Qujiang Express] With the abandonment of Guangzhou, reporters have dispersed. Recently, as the center of the province has shifted to Shao, many journalists have arrived in Shao for work. In order to promote the salvation effort, it was decided to jointly organize the Guangdong Northern Journalists' Association. Chen Xiyu of the Ta Kung Pao, Lu Huisheng of the Da Guang Pao, Xie Rucheng of the Hua Zi Pao, Si Jingguang of the Nanfeng Society, and Wang Ganliang of the Boai Society were appointed to be responsible for preparing for the establishment. They will also contact colleagues from Guangzhou and Hong Kong to jointly plan the operation. In the future, the provincial journalists' association will be moved to Shaoguan, and the Guangzhou journalists' association will set up an office in Shao to engage in the salvation movement.

### Japanese Troops in Shunde Continue to Decrease; Our Teams Seize the Opportunity to Attack

[Zhongshan Express] The Japanese troops at various strongholds in Shunde, including Daliang, Chencun, Ronggui, Lecong, and Ganzhu, are now gradually withdrawing, and most of them are being transported to Foshan. The number of Japanese troops in Longjiang and Longshan has also been reduced to just over a hundred. Our guerrilla teams in various places seized the opportunity to attack the Japanese troops. Our teams are very active in Dahuanbu, Jizhou, Shitanpu, Xiaoyong, and Shatou. Daliang and Ronggui were attacked by our forces for several nights. On the 13th and 14th nights, dozens of our team members broke in late at night and killed more than a dozen Japanese and puppet soldiers. Afterwards, over a hundred Japanese troops came from the west gate to reinforce them. Our team retreated calmly. The Japanese troops are now very wary of our plainclothes teams.

### Guangdong Provincial Government to Work Together; Implementation Decided from June 1; Detailed Rules Passed by Provincial Affairs Conference

[Shaoguan Special Dispatch] In order to increase the effectiveness of administration, Li Han魂, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, previously planned for the provincial government to work together.

### Refugee Transportation Stations and Reception Centers to be Set Up in Thirty-Five Places First

[Shaoguan Special Dispatch] Li Han魂, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Relief Committee, believes that the refugees withdrawing from the war zone are extremely pitiful and has decided to set up transportation stations and reception centers as a remedy. It has been decided to set them up in the areas adjacent to the war zone, and the relief associations and relief corps in each county have been ordered to do so. The first locations to be set up are Xinhui, Taishan, Kaiping, Enping, Conghua, Qingyuan, Fogang, Yingde, Qujiang, Gaoyao, Deqing, Fengchuan, Heshan, Gaoming, Xinxing, Yunfu, Sihui, Xinfeng, Boluo, Huiyang, Longmen, Heyuan, Chao'an, Jieyang, Shunde, Meixian, Xingning, Wuchuan, Lianjiang, Xuwen, Haikang, Suixi, Hepu, and Lingshan, totaling thirty-five places.

### Shaoguan Evacuates Women, Children, and Vagrants to Prevent Japanese Aircraft from Indiscriminately Bombing

[Shaoguan Special Dispatch] Since various party, military, and government agencies have moved to Shaoguan, it has gradually formed a wartime new provincial capital of Guangdong. The number of civil servants, merchants, refugees, and others coming from all directions has increased by more than 10,000 compared to before, and more than 20,000 compared to the time of the major bombing. There are now approximately 40,000 people in total, and business is becoming increasingly prosperous. Recently, Japanese aircraft have been frantically bombing various counties in Guangdong, targeting civilian houses and merchants, causing many tragedies. On the 14th night, the Shaoguan Garrison Headquarters and other institutions and organizations held a meeting and decided to evacuate women, children, and vagrants from the city, first by persuasion and then by force. Materials will also be moved. Fire protection will be improved. All agencies should effectively prevent bombing by Japanese aircraft and properly plan for air defense and relief.

### Fierce Fighting Between the Japanese and Our Forces Near Chengmai

[Hepu Correspondence] According to a telegram from Xuwen: (1) From 7:00 PM on the 6th of this month to 5:00 AM on the 7th, gunfire in the northeast of Haikou Qiongshan was incessant and could be clearly heard in Baisha, which belongs to the county. (2) At 9:00 AM on the 5th, our guerrilla forces were in fierce fighting with the Japanese forces near Beidaishi, Chengmai. A Japanese aircraft also assisted in the battle from the air, dropping incendiary bombs and destroying many houses. (3) There are approximately 100 Japanese troops stationed in Anding County, over a hundred Japanese troops stationed in Dan County, over 400 Japanese troops stationed in Wenchang, over 300 Japanese troops stationed in Jiaji, and over a hundred Japanese troops stationed in Xinhaigang. (4) At 8:00 AM on the 7th, a sailboat carrying refugees from Qiongshan tried to smuggle them to Baisha in the county, but was spotted and chased by a Japanese艇 in the middle of the journey. All the refugees were seized, and the sailboat drifted to the sea.

### Guangdong Provincial Government Commends Qingyuan's Effective Anti-Japanese Troops; Paijiang Self-Defense Corps Members Commended for Their Meritorious Service; Provincial Government Allocates 3,000 Provincial Dollars

[Shaoguan Special Dispatch] Li, Chairman of Guangdong Province, commended the Paijiang Self-Defense Corps in Qingyuan County for their heroic resistance. In November of last year, when the Japanese attacked Jietou town, over two thousand members of the Paijiang Self-Defense Corps engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese for four days and nights. Hundreds of villages and shops near the battlefield were destroyed. The corps members fought fearlessly and eventually repelled the Japanese. After this battle, the Japanese continued to invade from time to time, and the local corps made repeated efforts to inflict heavy damage on the Japanese, which is highly commendable. In addition to providing relief to the casualties, it has been approved that the measures for providing relief to the casualties of the people who fought in the resistance be implemented. The individuals who participated in the battles and made outstanding contributions should be rewarded separately to show encouragement. 3,000 provincial dollars will be specially allocated by the provincial government, with 1,000 dollars as bonuses for those who contributed to the resistance and 2,000 dollars as a reserve fund for anti-Japanese supplies. These funds will be entrusted to responsible local gentry and merchants for safekeeping. In the event of another Japanese invasion, they will be allocated to the members participating in the anti-Japanese corps for food. Yesterday, Mo Xiong, the administrative inspector of the Sixth District, was ordered to send personnel to collect the funds and forward them to the Qingyuan County Government for proper handling.

### After Our Forces Recovered Fuhe Market, Zengcheng Japanese Troops Plan to Defend Zhongxin to the Death; 500 Japanese Soldiers Opened to Aid Zhongxin Market Yesterday

[East River Express] After our Eastern Route Army recovered Fuhe Market on the Zengcong Line, they continued to advance westward, putting pressure on the Japanese troops at Zhongxin Market on the Fucong Highway, and attacking the Zhucun and other strongholds on the Guangzeng Highway. According to the Japanese troops in Zengcheng, fearing that their retreat route would be cut off, and with Zhongxin gradually becoming unsustainable under the control of our army, the Zengcheng Japanese troops urgently requested assistance from Guangzhou. However, Guangzhou had no troops to spare, so they reluctantly drew troops from Zengcheng to reinforce Zhongxin. Yesterday on the 11th, over 500 Zengcheng infantry and over 50 horses set out from Pengwu to Zhongxin, with the aim of defending this point to the death to protect the Fucong Highway and prevent our army from advancing westward from Fuhe. It is reported that our army is also prepared to launch a major encirclement and annihilation of the Japanese troops in Zhongxin.

### Yuan Dai Discusses: Zhongshan's Defense is Consolidated; Even if the Japanese Invade, They will Find it Difficult to Succeed

[Shiqi Express] There have been quite a few rumors in Zhongshan recently, and people's hearts are unsettled. According to Yuan Dai, commander of the First District Guerrilla Special Operations Detachment, Zhongshan is bordered by the sea on three sides, and ships come and go, whether many or few. Our defense has always paid unremitting attention. As for the Japanese bandits' harassment, there have been no fewer than a hundred times since the war of resistance, and they have all been repelled by our loyal and brave teams. The coast is currently peaceful, and the hearts of the people in the county are stable. According to intelligence from various departments, there has been no unusual activity from the Japanese warships. The rumors may be caused by misrepresentations from other places. Our defense is consolidated, and coastal surveillance is tight. Even if the Japanese invade, they will certainly not succeed.

[Zhongshan Express] Since Wu Fei arrived in the county to take over as Commander of the Sixth District Guerrilla Forces, the headquarters has been officially established. A telegram was sent to Li, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and Zhang, Commander of the Fourth War Zone, to report that Commander Wu has taken over and is strengthening Zhongshan's defense and completing war preparedness measures within a limited time. On the 13th, he informed the county government and ordered the district and village heads to immediately dispatch able-bodied men, 20 to 50 from each village, to rotate in various districts and concentrate in a certain place to be assigned to defense engineering work. Everything related to local wartime relief equipment and measures has also been largely completed. Commander Wu will soon begin to reorganize the teams and strengthen the people's armed forces.

### Women and Children Service Corps Expanding Organization to Assist in Rescuing War Orphans

[Shaoguan Express] The Women and Children Service Corps, which was previously established in Guangning, has been ordered to conduct continuous training for some time. They have also recruited the female recruits' team and juvenile refugees, organized them into cadres, and managed them with military means. Their achievements are outstanding. Yesterday, the Women's New Life Movement Promotion Association summoned Chen Rushu, the head of the corps, to Shaoguan, seemingly to expand the organization so that it can broadly recruit motivated women and work closely with the women's work team of the New Life Movement to engage in rear-area work. Assisting the provincial relief committee in rescuing war orphans may increase assistance.

### Liang Hancao Returns to Guangxi to Promote Political Work

[Guilin Air Mail] Liang Hancao, Director of the Political Department of the Western Route Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, returned to Hunan from Guangxi this month and then transferred to northern Guangdong. It is said that his task is to understand the actual situation of political work in the Fourth and Ninth War Zones and the local environment. Currently, Liang has returned to Guangxi and will use what he has observed from this trip as a standard for improving political work in the future. The situations in Hunan and Guangdong are different, and he will issue guidelines for promoting political work separately, so that the political departments of all subordinate troops can follow them.

### Japanese Smuggling Vietnamese Rice to Supply Food; Weizhou Japanese Cavalry Robbed Our Salt Boat

[Fangcheng Express] On the 4th of this month, two or three gunshots suddenly came from the waters off Huanwei, Fangcheng. After investigation, it was learned that three Japanese transport ships had sailed to the outside of Bailongwei late last night and were anchored in the waters off Huanwei, approximately ten thousand meters from the shore. This area is where our country's territorial waters meet Annam, which belongs to the French. At dawn, each of the three transport ships fired a cannon as a signal. Soon, more than a dozen Annamese sailing ships, loaded with white rice, sailed into the ship, unloaded the rice, and then the Japanese ships fled. According to reliable sources, Japanese transport ships come to this sea every two or three days to pick up food. After firing cannons, Annamese sailing ships will transport rice to supply them. It is said that they have transported three or four times this year. According to refugees from Weizhou, there are still over a hundred Japanese soldiers on the island, who have been busy building air defense works over the past month, and they are oppressing the compatriots on the island in every possible way, as in the past. On the 7th, a double-smokestack Japanese vessel robbed one of our variant-masted salt boats in the waters of Guantouling and sailed to Weizhou, where they unloaded all the salt on the ship and landed it.

### Seventh District Administrative Commissioner, Zhang Yan, Arrives in Lianjiang to Personally Lead Team in Combat Exercise

(Lianjiang Express) Zhang Yan, the Administrative Commissioner of the Seventh District, has arrived in Lianjiang. The people of this county held a welcoming meeting at the Zhongshan Memorial Pavilion on the afternoon of the 7th. Those present included Commissioner Zhang, Commander Zheng Weiji, Deputy Commander Zou Minfu, Inspector Zhou Yinxin, County Magistrate Wang Guangxuan, along with public officials from various departments, all faculty and students of schools, the anti-Japanese self-defense work team from villages near the city, self-defense groups, and people from all walks of life, totaling no less than three thousand people. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. During the meeting, Commissioner Zhang gave instructions regarding the work the people should do for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, as well as the recent military and political measures of the Commissioner's Office, explaining everything in detail. This was followed by speeches from Commander Zheng and Inspector Zhou. Finally, County Magistrate Wang and Deputy Commander Zou also gave speeches. In the end, the village work team presented a flag to Commissioner Zhang, embroidered with the four characters "National Vanguard." The Commissioner then led thousands of people to Lianjiang's coastal areas for an exercise, enhancing team combat techniques.

Movies and Drama

### Movie City Notes

Errol Flynn was once reported missing, only to be found three weeks later at the New York Racquet Club, accompanied by Jerome Dillon and Charles McArthur (Hedy Lamarr's husband), claiming he was on his way to Mexico. The truth was thus revealed.

Colman was originally set to star in 20th Century Fox's "The Rainscam," but due to the high price, Tyrone Power has taken over the role, with Loretta Young as the female lead.

A gathering was recently held in Hollywood, revealing the talents of several stars. Paul Muni and Lya Lys could juggle, and James Cagney could tap dance.

Norma Shearer has recently been seen frequently with Brian Aherne, leading many in Hollywood to believe they might get together.

Hollywood recently unanimously praised Bette Davis' success in "Dark Victory." The male lead in the film is George Brent. Tyrone Power's wife, Annabella, will sing a French song in "Mademoiselle Fifi."

James Stewart has signed a contract with Columbia and will collaborate with Frank Capra, the producer of "You Can't Take It With You," to star in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," with Jean Arthur as the female lead. Since "You Can't Take It With You," movies with titles like "Mr. Something Goes Somewhere" have been very popular.

Two of 20th Century Fox's leading ladies, Alice Faye and Nancy Kelly, will co-star with Gail Patrick and Joan Davis in "Three Blind Mice." The male lead will be Cesar Romero, along with two newcomers. Adolphe Menjou will co-star with Barbara Stanwyck in "Golden Boy."

Claudette Colbert and Don Ameche will co-star in "Midnight," with supporting roles played by John Barrymore, Mary Astor, etc. Charles Laughton has a film called "The Beachcomber" coming out.

Frank Lloyd will direct "Rulers of the Sea" in Technicolor for Paramount.

Loretta Young and Cary Grant will star in "Our Wife."

The new stars of "Four Daughters" and "Hard to Get," Priscilla Lane, Rosemary Lane, and Lola Lane, will collaborate for the third time in "Episode."

In addition to starring alone in "The Sea Hawk," Errol Flynn will also co-star with Bette Davis in "The Knight and the Lady."

### New Hollywood Business: 24/7 Service to Escort Drunks

Hollywood is the movie capital of America, and it can also be said to be the creator of new businesses in the world. Novel businesses that don't exist elsewhere are constantly being established there.

Recently, the widow of Western movie star Ken Maynard announced that she will organize a group in Hollywood called "The Cavaliers." The business model of this company is to specialize in escorting drunk people home from nightclubs and then charging them a fee. She has now hired twelve young and beautiful university graduates and is actively training them for this job, which will soon be officially established.

To ensure the safety of its customers, Mrs. Maynard strictly prohibits her employees from drinking alcohol and has registered their fingerprints with the Washington Detective Association.

Mrs. Maynard said, "Our business method is to sign contracts with nightclubs and hotels in advance. When a customer is too drunk to drive, they are asked if they want a 'Cavalier' to escort them home. If they need one, we immediately call us. We will send an employee in evening dress to quickly rush to that place, help the drunk person into the car, and safely send them home. This service does not stop for a moment in 24 hours a day."

It is said that the establishment of "The Cavaliers" has been approved by the police and several nightclubs and hotels, because with this team, car accidents can be reduced a lot.

### Hedy Lamarr's New Film Fails, Will Be Pulled from Release

After arriving in Hollywood, Hedy Lamarr achieved success with "Algiers," co-starring Charles Boyer. Her new film, "I Take This Woman," co-starring Spencer Tracy, has recently been completed, but the producers and directors are very dissatisfied with the film. They would rather stop its release than ruin the future of the female artist in whom Hollywood has placed great hope. Thus, Hedy Lamarr's six months of hard work have been in vain.

The reason for the film's failure can be seen in Spencer Tracy's comments when asked about his impression of Hedy Lamarr. He said, "The strangest thing in the plot is that I am forced to reject the pursuit of the most beautiful woman in Hollywood today. She is pursuing me, and I am avoiding her. This is ridiculous. They (referring to the producers, etc.) do not know that soon after, this unreasonable plot will ruin the future of a female artist whom they regard as a treasure."

The only thing that can comfort Hedy Lamarr now is her marriage to screenwriter Gene Markey. Although her love life is good, her fate is lamentable.

### Pygmalion (Part 2)

Produced by MGM

Original Work by George Bernard Shaw

Starring Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller

The young woman revealed a look of anger, looked at Higgins and said, 'I have come to learn,' her voice was very difficult, making people want to cover their ears, 'I can also pay a shilling a lesson, Mr. Higgins', but her eyes showed a pleading look,

Give him a shilling a lesson,

'I want to find a better job', she continued, 'but people all complain that my voice is too rough, you said last night that you could teach me, now I am here'.

It was Pickering who spoke first, 'What is your name?' he asked softly,

'Eliza Doolittle', even saying a simple name, the pronunciation was very unpleasant,

'Miss Doolittle, please sit down', he said politely,

A faint smile flashed on her cheeks, adding much to her beauty,

'One shilling—', Higgins slowly repeated, suddenly an idea arose in his mind, he stared at her, making her a little scared, and fidgeting with her fingers,

Pickering exhaled a puff of smoke and sarcastically said to him, 'If you can really save her so she can meet the government ambassador, then she really deserves to be your great professor'.

Higgins looked at the two of them, 'I agree to take you as a student', he said firmly to her, and said to Pickering, 'I will definitely make her a duchess'

Pickering, however, provoked and shouted, 'All expenses, if you can do it, will be paid by me',

'It's a deal, let's start right away', Higgins said, he turned to Missis Pearce who was waiting, 'Throw away her clothes, buy new ones for her, and give her a bath',

'I'm not dirty', Eliza retorted angrily, her voice even harsher, 'I washed my face and hands when I came, really',

She kept arguing when Pearce took her away, After she left, Higgins thoughtfully pressed a buzzer,

'I'm not dirty, I washed my face and hands when I came, really', the voice came from a secret recorder,

### Who Will Ultimately Own the Xuhe Cup? South China and the Navy Clash Again, Meeting at Jia Hill This Afternoon at 4:30 PM, Leung Wing-chiu and Lai Siu-wing's Foot Injuries Have Recovered and They Can Play

(Our Newspaper Special) The summer heat is like a burning fire, originally unsuitable for intense football exercise. Therefore, the five championship competitions organized by the General Association were concluded at the end of last month.

However, the Xuhe Cup remains unresolved and a championship battle must be held at Jia Hill today. Moreover, there is a charity match between South China and the Hong Kong League this Saturday, so during this period, football matters are in a state of flux.

Last Saturday was originally the time to resolve who would own the Xuhe Cup, but because several South China players had foot injuries and could not fight with a complete lineup, they tied the Navy with a score of one each. The honor was 'not yet clearly assigned', so there will be another showdown today.

The battle location is still at Jia Hill, starting at 4:30 PM. If a winner has not been decided after the full 70 minutes, extra time will be added. Because South China is leaving for a southern tour soon, it cannot be delayed any longer.

It is said that Leung Wing-chiu and Lai Siu-wing have recovered from their foot injuries and can play today. Therefore, the arranged lineup is more complete than last time. On the Navy side, because the battleship 'Simple Number' has left Hong Kong, the front line lacks Moore. Judging from this, South China's strength has increased, while the Navy's has weakened. Comparing the two, South China's chances of victory are very high.

First, list the two lineups, and then talk about other things.

South China

Cheung Wing-choi, Lee Kwok-wai, Lee Tin-sang, Lau Hing-choi, Leung Wing-chiu, Kwok Ying-kee, Yeung Shui-yik, Lai Siu-wing, Fung King-cheung, Yip Bak-wah, Tang Kwong-sam

Substitutes: Leung Pak-wai, Tse Kam-hung, Lee Yan-leung, Law Dou-man

Navy

Dickason, Hannaway, Handley, Hannaway, Callia, Cooper, , Morris, Tobin, Rocktoran

With Wing-chiu in the center, the strength of assistance in attack and defense will definitely increase. With Siu-wing on the front line, the progress will be more sharp. The reason why South China has not won seven times is that the front line lacked Siu-wing and used Kwok Ying-kee instead, so the entire connection was not fully realized. This time, with Siu-wing playing, the cooperation of each player will be fully developed to try to win.

With Siu-wing participating in the battle, Ying-kee will be transferred to left midfielder. He is quick and good at passing, which is similar to Lau Hing-choi on the right. Under the cover, the front line players can get suitable passes and will be more active.

Lee Kwok-wai has been getting better and better since taking over Mack Shao-han's position. It is an obvious improvement after changing his style.

Today, South China's strategy for advancing should not adopt the central breakthrough method. Fung King-cheung is good at dribbling, but not good at charging. If this method is adopted, it will not be appropriate. Moreover, Cooper, the Navy's center forward, is experienced, good at positioning, and not good at attacking. His responsibility is more defense than attack. Therefore, King-cheung should use his flexible feet to lure Cooper out, weaken his defensive power, and then use flanking attacks from the left and right. Then there is no need to worry about not being able to attack.

However, South China still uses Yeung Shui-yik on the left wing instead of Law Dou-man. This seems inappropriate. It is said that the reason for not using Dou-man is that he is too negligent in his responsibilities. When he gets the ball, he has no suitable pass or successful dribbling, and he misses more opportunities than he creates. Therefore, Shui-yik is still used, but it is hoped that Shui-yik's performance today will not be as unsatisfactory as last time, so as not to disappoint the selectors.

In short, if South China can fight with the above lineup, it will definitely win and the creation of winning the championship can be completed. If substitutes are used instead of the original lineup, then victory will definitely not be easy. (Football Field Grand Duke)

### Men's Basketball Grade A Championship Finally Won by South China, Yesterday Winning Over Star Island 44 to 43

The public men's basketball Grade A match, Star Island vs. South China, was held last night to determine the champion. Both sides went all out as their very existence depended on the outcome, and the general fans cheered loudly for the team they supported. Therefore, between gains and losses, the sound shook the roof tiles. During the forty-minute fierce competition, the atmosphere was in extreme tension. As a result, South China defeated Star Island with a score of 44 to 43 and won the championship this year. Star Island sighed that fate was lacking.

South China's ability to achieve this record was due to the team's tacit coordination and the unremitting efforts of each member. Whether in space or time, they never let go easily. Although Shek Chun-chi was tightly marked and could not fully reveal his true colors, he had fulfilled his responsibilities. Chan Sun-kau's dribbling and charging were fierce and unparalleled, creating many shooting opportunities. Ma Kit-man was both intelligent and brave, able to attack empty positions and was extremely outstanding. Luk Yan-king and Shek Chun-dat repeatedly seized the opponent's passes, frustrating the enemy's attack, and as a defender, repeatedly attacked the front to shoot. His performance was the best in the team. It is a pity that Li Pui-chek and Leung Kwok-tok took advantage of this. However, the team's passing was done with short distances or bouncing the ball to avoid interception by the opponent, and the speed of passing could avoid everything. All positions rotated, making the opponent unable to grasp the situation. However, throwing the ball still lacked skill.

Star Island's Leung Kwok-lo's long shots, Tai Fuk-sing and Li Pui-chek's repeated stealing to the basket, contributed a lot. Poon Yiu-kwan and Sun Nga-long were tightly marked and unable to use their skills. Li Pui-yim, originally a capable member of Star Island, only played for a short time in yesterday's battle, which is very puzzling. The team's coordination was better than South China's. The passing method was especially commendable, and the jumping ball under the basket was also better. Therefore, their defeat was not due to inferior skills, but because their desire to win was too strong, and they often failed to seize opportunities. For example, Tai Fuk-sing got a free throw in the last minute but failed to hit it, and was defeated by South China by one point.

During the match, Star Island's Tai Fuk-sing's long shot opened the scoring. Soon, South China tied the score at 4-4 and 8-8, and then took the lead at 12-8. Afterwards, the two sides each scored points, and the scores were tied at 12, 16, and 20. The first half ended. South China then took the lead again with 24-21. After switching sides, the two sides played as if in a seesaw, but South China was always in the lead. The scores were 30-25, 33-25, 35-26. In the last nine minutes, Star Island caught up and the score was 37-41 and 40-43. With two minutes left, the two sides tied at 43-43. South China then scored a free throw. Tai Fuk-sing also got a free throw, but unfortunately missed. By then, the clock on the wall had rung, and South China shouted triumphantly in jubilation.

Business Discussion

### Discussion on Handling War Losses ×××

— Lu Shanchi

Since the August 13th Incident, the occupied areas have been reduced to ruins, and most industrial and commercial enterprises have been affected. Although the extent of damage varies, it is essential to seek relief and plan for the aftermath. Mr. Xi Yushu, a local accountant, previously drafted an opinion on this matter and submitted it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review. Recently, a reply was received, and Mr. Xi has added supplementary measures and made them public. For a time, industrial and commercial enterprises, recognizing the significant impact on their own interests, have paid close attention and actively discussed it. The author believes that the handling of war losses should have specific measures to follow. However, the content of these measures should be carefully considered to ensure comprehensiveness. Otherwise, inappropriate measures will have a negative impact on the industrial and commercial sectors. Therefore, I venture to offer some humble opinions for discussion.

The most important aspect of Mr. Xi's proposal and the Ministry of Economic Affairs' approved measures is "treating war losses as deferred assets and offsetting them with annual profits." We believe that this measure is somewhat simplistic and may be difficult to implement uniformly. At the same time, treating war losses as deferred assets and specifying that they must be offset by annual profits also feels somewhat ambiguous in its wording. The term "deferred assets" is a technical term in accounting. According to accounting methods, the amortization of deferred assets must be carried out during the final settlement. In other words, the amortization amount of deferred assets must first be listed as expenses before calculating net profit, rather than calculating net profit first and then engaging in amortization. Therefore, if war losses are handled as deferred assets, their allocation and offsetting cannot be done from annual profits. However, if the amortization and offsetting should indeed be done from profits, then war losses cannot be treated as deferred assets. Thus, according to the original wording, it is not clear how war losses should be handled. Judging from the restrictions on the amortization period shown later, it seems to indicate that the amortization and offsetting should be done before the final settlement. Otherwise, the calculation of income tax is originally based on net profit. If there is profit, tax should be paid. Why bother considering its amortization period? Below, please first discuss whether war losses can be treated as deferred assets.

(1) In accounting, the term "deferred assets" comes from the English "Deferred Assets." The definition of "Deferred" originally means delay or extension. In accounting, for some prepaid expenses, because their benefits may extend to the following year, and at the same time, this loss should not be borne by the current year in fact, so it is temporarily treated as assets. One is to allow its benefits to extend to the following year, and the other is to transfer the expenses that the current year should not bear to the following year. Its meaning is profound, and its method is excellent. Therefore, for expenditures such as prepaid rent and prepaid insurance, accounting has almost confirmed their nature as deferred assets. However, for opening expenses, doubts inevitably arise about the extension of their benefits and whether they should be transferred to the following year. Therefore, scholars still cannot unanimously confirm it as a type of deferred asset. Now, war losses occur completely unexpectedly, and after they occur, there are no benefits that can be extended to the following year, nor is there any reason to argue that they must be shared by future years. It is a confirmed loss and cannot be compared with prepaid expenses. This is very obvious. This is one point that accounting theory considers questionable.

(2) Any enterprise, if it wants to develop soundly, must make capital enrichment its only goal. The way to enrich capital is to have a large amount of public reserves on the active side and no floating assets on the passive side. The company law stipulates that surplus must be used to deposit public reserves when distributing surplus, strictly supervises the investment of assets other than money, prohibits the discount issuance of share capital, and the common practice of merchants and income tax laws encourage low prices for asset valuation, all in order to make the capital of enterprises tend to be enriched. Now, in terms of war losses, the original assets have obviously been lost, and the capital has obviously been damaged. However, if it is still allowed to be retained as an asset on the books, it is obviously contrary to the principle of capital enrichment. I am afraid that the result may not be able to alleviate the current difficulties, but it will be greatly harmful to the attempt to regenerate in the future. This is the second point that business financial management considers questionable.

(3) Any enterprise, if it has a surplus at the end of the year, in addition to compensating for losses and depositing legal public reserves, shareholders can request the distribution of dividends. Now, for enterprises that have suffered losses due to war, if the losses are listed as carried-forward losses, then before the full amount is compensated, even if there is a surplus, shareholders are not allowed to request the distribution of dividends according to law. However, if they are listed as deferred assets, it will inevitably allow those who are originally in loss to still be settled as surplus, and those who should have a smaller surplus will be able to settle more surplus. Therefore, shareholders can request the distribution of a large amount of dividends (because it has been admitted that losses can be treated as assets before, it cannot restrict shareholders from requesting the distribution of dividends later). However, this surplus is originally false. If it is allowed to be distributed, it will inevitably evolve into a phenomenon of using capital as interest, which is still a taboo even in peacetime, let alone after the war when the foundation of the enterprise has already been weakened. Therefore, the result of treating war losses as deferred assets is simply using accounting techniques to openly violate the legal provision that "no dividends can be distributed without profit." This is the third point that legal considerations consider questionable. (To be continued)

### South China Requests the General Association to Shorten Li Shuoyou's Suspension Period

[Report from our Correspondent] Li Shuoyou, the left winger of the South China football team, was red carded by referee Ye Jiu for a foul during a special Silver Shield match between the team and the Eastern Association team in early of this year. Subsequently, the executive committee of the Football Association decided to impose a heavy penalty, suspending his eligibility to play until the end of this year. Now, the authorities of the South China Association Football Department believe that although Li's foul on that day was inappropriate, the suspension for as long as one year seems excessive. Therefore, they recently sent a letter to the General Association, requesting that Li's suspension period be shortened so that he can return to play on the day the next football season begins. It is heard that the General Association will hold a meeting during the day to discuss this request.

### Sneaking into Wuhu City

— Wang Ping

Snippets of a city occupied by × people

When you meet × people, you have to salute, but you can't put your feet together and stick your hands to your sides. If you're too proper, they'll say you're a Chinese soldier. You should deliberately act like a country bumpkin doing a bow. This way, the enemy soldiers might even pat you on the shoulder and say, "Good citizen, good citizen," and let you pass. At some places, the enemy sentries will let you pass if you give them three or four eggs!

Inside the city, the searches by the × people are quite strict, but it doesn't matter, there are real good citizens to cover you. At the same time, when you enter the city, you have to prepare beforehand, either pretending to be a merchant or a farmer. If you can speak Anhui dialect, that's even better. After the × soldiers check your whereabouts, they will definitely ask, "Are there any Chinese soldiers?" "Are there any New Fourth Army soldiers?" You shake your head and wave your hands and say, "I don't know, we don't have any where we live," or deliberately say, "Lots and lots," These nonsensical words are sometimes said by the innkeepers (or shopkeepers). They are country bumpkins, what do they know, and then you can pass. In short, as long as you deal with it properly and don't cause trouble, it doesn't matter if they catch you, especially now that × is adopting a "appeasement policy." How can they burn and kill on such a large scale like in the past when they talk about so much benevolence, righteousness, and morality? Therefore, according to the × people's own estimates, there are more than two thousand "plainclothes detectives" active in our city of Wuhu, making them uneasy day and night. The Nanjing Secret Service also set up a "Wuhu class" here, on the one hand training traitors, and on the other hand dealing with our "plainclothes detectives."

The most prosperous street in Wuhu is still Zhongshan Road Changjie, but so-called "prosperity" really just means that there are more people. There are no large stores, except for some foreign firms and associations opened by × people. At most, there are small stalls set up by refugees, selling Japanese goods for the × people and barely making a living under the heavy military taxes and exploitation. However, business is also extremely slow. In addition, what is really thriving is prostitution and gambling. Almost all the large hotels, such as "Dahua" and "Zhongnan," are gambling dens and brothels. There are even publicly advertised brothels in the traitor newspapers, soliciting customers, and there are even Japanese prostitutes' houses. These prostitutes who have been reduced to inhuman status must not only provide their bodies to "comfort" the "Imperial Army," but also hand over the blood and sweat they have earned from selling their flesh to the "Imperial Army" every day! The lowest official "flower tax" is two yuan, and there are other miscellaneous taxes, such as inspection fees. At the same time, the "Imperial Army" is even more thoughtful and wants them to "receive training" to learn more captivating skills so that they can use their charms to gather intelligence and become spies for the "Imperial Army"!

In addition to training prostitutes as detectives, they also pull monks and nuns out of the "Buddhist gate" and into the "mortal world" to take the scarce bloody money and act as accomplices for the nemesis of the Bodhisattva—the Japanese ××—reaching all beings. It's really "sinful, sinful," the schemes of the × people can be said to be unscrupulous!

The pseudo-county magistrate of Wuhu used to be Zhu Yu's subordinate. Because he wagged his tail so diligently, he has now been promoted to provincial commissioner. It is said that the × people recently appointed him as the pseudo-governor of "Jiangnan Province"—renaming Jingwu as "Jiangnan Province." The current county magistrate of Wuhu is Wang Yizidong, a "former Qing scholar." Every time he goes out, he must have a large number of Japanese military police "protecting" him. The same is true in the "county government" and the "official residence." In fact, they are monitoring him. Therefore, in addition to being afraid of the Chinese troops, they are even more afraid of their own masters. Being a traitor is really bitter!

In order to "prosper" the market and pretend to be peaceful, the × people have restored, renamed, or rebuilt several theaters. The Fuguang and Guangming theaters show movies, and the films are numbing goods such as "King of Ten Thousand Years" and "Heroes and Heroines." The Huayuan Grand Stage and the Fuxing Grand Stage are dedicated to performing operas. The entrances of the theaters and the advertisements in the pseudo-newspapers are all prominently written with words such as "Imperial Army Half Price," "Preferential Treatment for the Imperial Army," or "Welcome the Imperial Army to Be Seated."

There are several streets where pedestrians are absolutely prohibited, and that is where the × people's barracks and wounded soldiers' hospitals are located. Their wounded soldiers cannot run around casually. First, they are afraid of disturbing the market. Second, they are afraid that the enemy soldiers will see the injuries. Third, they are afraid that we will find out the exact number of his wounded soldiers and estimate his troop strength. These places can be said to be the enemy's weaknesses!

Speaking of wounded soldiers, I am reminded of the screams from the Wuhu granary at 10 pm on the 12th of April. That day, as soon as it got dark, the enemy imposed martial law, prohibiting any pedestrians from passing. The common people knew that something important must have happened again. Before long, several wounded Japanese soldiers who had just been defeated at Jiulishan and were eating in a small tavern were pulled up by several Japanese military police and left. The wounded soldiers asked them to let them "misi misi" (eat) before leaving. (To be continued)

### Shi Dakai's Poems

— Zou Xiao

There are very few poems by Shi Dakai in the collections compiled by Lao He and Lu Jiye in their "Poems and Prose of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," which makes readers feel inadequate. There is also the "Diary of Shi Dakai" re-edited by Xu Zhizhi. According to the preface, Xu Zhiyan once "polished the words," so whether this diary is real or how much it has been polished becomes a problem.

Shi Dakai probably wrote many poems, but we can only see thirty of them now. The "Complete Works of Shi Dakai" has four more poems than the "Poems and Prose of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," namely "To Mr. Shi Longgan of Xiangxiang."

The two poems of emotion in Shi Dakai's diary are recorded in all books. In addition, there are many mentions of writing poems, but unfortunately Shi Dakai did not attach the original poems. For example, it says:

"On the first day of the fourth month, I wrote several more poems, thinking that Wei's control over the north was like an iceberg. Within a month, they would fight each other. Heaven's way is just, so why should people do evil!"

"On the twenty-fourth day of the fourth month, I watched the moon and wrote pine ballads at night, and the fourth girl harmonized them." (At the time in Jingzhou)

"On the first day of the fifth month, my daughter, the fourth girl, married Ma Shuji Delian, and I wrote a small poem to commemorate it, with the line 'Since there is love, they become a family, how dare I say the colorful phoenix goes to follow the crow,' which is a factual record."

"On the twenty-eighth day of the fifth month, I was overwhelmed with old sorrows and emotions, so I composed several poems, which were taken away hand-in-hand. The fourth girl kept them for me. I don't know who will take them and cover the jar with them one day." Presumably "Chaos within chaos" and "Our dynasty is wounded by internal strife" were both written at this time.

"On the fifteenth day of the ninth month, I arrived in Yanping and passed the former residence of Zheng Chenggong, and wrote a poem on the wall before leaving."

"On the sixth day of the fourth month, I visited Taoyuan and listened back in the evening, composing several yin poems."

"On the fifth day of the fifth month, the fourth girl gave birth to a daughter, and I now have a granddaughter, and I wrote a poem to show Ma Sheng."

If the diary is not fabricated, then, as recorded above, at least a dozen poems have been lost.

However, even among the existing thirty poems, some are unreliable. According to Liu Yazi, some of the lost ones were forged by his deceased friend Gao Tianyu in order to promote revolution.

Among the existing poems, whether in content or form, there are quite a few that are close to Cao Zhi. Shi Dakai was also alienated by Hong Xiuquan and resented by Na Changhui, so he escaped. As he says, "Quietly thinking, I sigh three times, and tears wet my sleeves." "Our dynasty is wounded by internal strife, alas, my heart is sad... What else can I say, where will I go?" "Time suddenly does not pass, the sun sets in the Central Plains, flesh and blood are scattered, and bones are exposed on the road." "The great river lacks boats, how can I cross the stream? Alas, there are no boats, I look northwest at the floating clouds." "We have been together for a long time, and we are about to say goodbye: ... Ambition stretches for thousands of miles, and his voice shakes in all directions." All of the above are very similar to Cao Siwang. The chaotic times, his own experiences, are all the same, no wonder even the poems are similar.

Although I know that some of Shi Dakai's poems are fake, and his so-called writing poems in his diary is even more unreliable, I always delusionally hope that they are all real. Maybe I like Shi Dakai too much.

### About Literary and Art Workers

— Zhou Xueming

The storm of national revolution that was the "August 13th" Incident shook everything in China. The old was discarded, and the new is growing in blood. As a reflection of the spirit of the times, literature and art must also have its own special progress.

First of all, it should be pointed out that the unprecedented national crisis has prompted the unity of writers, which has its historical roots. China's new literature and art have always been inseparable from the national liberation movement, especially at this stage. In order to complete the task of resisting Japan and promoting democracy in literature, regardless of their colors or factions (traitors and Trotskyites are of course exceptions), they should embark on a very frank and sincere path of mutual respect, exploration, and cooperation!

Secondly, due to the development of the anti-Japanese war, the lifestyles of writers have undergone tremendous changes. Most of them have gone to the front line or to the guerrilla areas to fulfill their missions, finding truth in the battlefield life, and their circle of life is even broader.

This great war of resistance is a cause of the masses, and everything must be based on them as the main force. In this way, literature and art must bear the mission of mobilizing them. Therefore, using old forms to establish the literature and art of the masses has become the most urgent thing for writers.

In order to meet the objective needs, small works such as sketches, newsletters, and reports have replaced cumbersome long works. This new function is to grasp the fragments of the drastically changing reality and express them powerfully. The recently launched literary and artistic communication movement is even more emphasizing this feature.

These facts all prove the progress of the literary and artistic circles since the Anti-Japanese War. However, due to the insufficient main strength of some writers, there are also many weaknesses that have been exposed.

The most noteworthy thing is the issue of the utilization of old forms by some writers. Due to too much accommodation and abuse of them, they have not yet fully obtained its clear, bright, and mass-friendly means of expression. There has been an extremely disharmonious phenomenon between the old forms and the new content, and even feudal superstitious vocabularies and expressive techniques are still being adopted.

The one-sidedness of the subject matter has led anti-Japanese literature and art to fall into a formulaic path. Most articles only write about the bravery of the soldiers on the front line, while ignoring the characters of various classes in the rear. The changing thoughts, lifestyles, or other forms that accompany the Anti-Japanese War can all be used as subjects for description. There are also some writers who often have the problem of self-embodiment in the expression of characters in his works. For example, the masses who are illiterate can actually say many jargons that do not fit their tone. The masses are naturally isolated from these. As a result, the paper becomes the so-called "donkey literature" that is neither fish nor fowl!

Now that the Anti-Japanese War has developed to the second stage, our literary and artistic workers should give full play to their abilities, review the past, coordinate with the objective situation, and fulfill the responsibility of their pens. Here are what we should pay attention to:

(1) Be cautious about the utilization of forms, especially for the adoption of local folk songs, new content should be instilled.

(2) The themes should be deepened and expanded to all classes, avoiding "formulaic" styles.

(3) Fully utilize the language of the masses to overcome the shortcomings of being separated from the masses.

(4) The artistic truthfulness must be unified with the popularization of the content.

The literature and art of the Anti-Japanese War is progressing with the times, and has a new enlightenment meaning. We must grasp this key point.

### Destruction and Rebirth

— Ding Di

Vanishing in smoke and fire, desperate groans, painful weeping, laughter turning to tears, bustling cities turning to desolate ruins, familiar faces becoming names of remembrance, reunited families turning into new ghosts.

Buried by demonic hands: humanity's vows, clues to happiness, peaceful air, prosperous life, mountains of morality, wings of freedom.

Inserting thorns one by one, piercing the dreams of your clothes. The beauty of past maturity is not fantasy or madness. Dreams, one by one, plump and full fruits, are pierced, fall to the ground, wither, are destroyed, and buried in the earth.

Unable to endure the pricking thorns, nor willing to succumb to destruction, the buried fruit, due to rain, sunlight, and soil, will eventually sprout, bud, blossom, and bear fruit.

——Destroyed, it will be reborn.

As long as a breath remains, the potential of life, neither silent nor willing to perish, everything can be reborn. Sprouts wither, but can re-emerge; failures occur, but can be retold; flowers fall, but can re-bloom; fruits break, but can re-form. The thorns of destruction pierce clothing, but only increase the anger in your heart. Anger is like kerosene, poured on the fire of life, making people more vital. Squeeze closer, you can push further; oppress harder, you can resist more; enrage more, you can be braver; destroy more, you can be reborn more.

Thank those heart-pricking thorns, which destroy all you have, making you cherish, pity, resent, and curse. Without these, you would not seek revenge. Without the push of anger, you would not be so powerful. Without forced destruction, you would not dismantle on your own.

You are destroyed, you are pushed, and you are stung. Those who cherish old things must create new things; those who pity the destroyed must give them comfort; those who resent the perpetrators must give them revenge; those who curse the wicked must give them retribution.

No need to offer condolences in the desolate ruins, searching for the past glory among the broken tiles, painting the slanting sun on the crumbling walls, and then you look at it and become speechless. You might as well be generous and heroic, smiling at your enemies while sharpening your swords. Thank destruction, destroying one fruit, which can produce two, three, or even hundreds. In the future, you can see magnificent buildings rising from scorched earth, a new generation more sound and powerful than their ancestors. Rottenness destroyed can produce soundness; the ancient destroyed can produce freshness; sediment destroyed can produce purity.

Destruction makes us angry, but it also makes us stronger. I am not afraid of destruction, only afraid of no rebirth.

### The Snow of Manchuria

— Shu Qun

"I still hope you will work with us forever in the future."

Smiled. Satisfied.

As she was about to leave, he suddenly erupted with a sense of farewell. He was reluctant to let her leave his side—after leaving, seeing her again would be distant. A short acquaintance, who knows when they would meet again? Although he believed she could become a comrade, who could guarantee that imagination could become reality? In this strange encounter, once he parted with her, if they went their separate ways in life, how would his unforgettable memories stir his heart? So, he asked his comrade to leave first, to move away; he escorted her home. He wished to use this final farewell to comfort the unease in his heart, both present and future, caused by his thoughts of her.

She was silently accompanied, walking along the same doorway, room door, and courtyard path she had walked before. She kept looking around, realizing that the departure was different from the arrival: the arrival was deep in the night two days ago, and she had felt resentment; the departure was shortly after this morning, and she felt that everything was worth cherishing. But the arrival was the same as the departure, and neither the arrival nor the departure was voluntary. It was as if it were a dream, in which he lingered for almost three days. These three days felt like a year, and yet also felt as fast as a moment.

The two of them walked side by side, already good friends. In their parting, the time was short; the words of farewell were endlessly long. The escort and the escorted were both unwilling to take long strides, both afraid of the road shortening, both hoping to extend the time by a moment, so that each could offer a few more words of farewell. That's how the two of them were; this departure was similar to her arrival, but completely opposite to his arrival.

Suddenly, on the road, she stopped; but this was not the same kind of stop as on her arrival. After thinking for a moment, she said:

"Did I forget something at your place?"

"I don't think so, did you?" (Six Seven)
