### Building Our University

— Su Lin

Many young people feel distressed because they cannot afford to go to school due to their families' financial circumstances, believing that their future is hopeless, and therefore become passive.

This is absolutely wrong. We don't necessarily have to go to schools for the wealthy to learn. We can learn and build "Our University" in any place and any environment. Because "society is our university," and this university is "all-encompassing" and "full of wonders," a good university that never ceases to amaze. For example, if we can't go to school, we can go to the countryside to farm. We can use this farming opportunity to study how to cultivate and improve agriculture. It would be best to find a few friends and form a group to discuss and research. If we learn about machinery, we can also invite a few friends to discuss and research together. This is much better than schools that only talk and "talk without doing"!

As I write this, some of you might question, "If I can't work with machinery or return to the countryside to farm, does that mean I can't learn?" No, absolutely not. If we cannot work with machinery or farm, we can still invite a few friends to study textbooks together, preferably focusing on theories of national salvation and political books. While this is good, it only benefits individuals and cannot contribute to the country or the nation. I think it would be better to join community organizations because there are many national salvation groups that offer singing classes, political training classes, guerrilla warfare training classes, seminars... We can learn a lot of national salvation theories here. At the same time, we can have the singing teams and drama groups in the community perform publicly to raise funds for the soldiers on the front lines, or organize comfort teams to visit the wounded soldiers, refugees, and soldiers on the front lines... Through these various activities, we can not only learn a lot of theories but also do something for the country and the nation. Isn't this killing two birds with one stone?

Young friends who are out of school or have not had the opportunity to study, please use every place and every opportunity to build "Our University" to learn practical and profound theories, and do a lot of practical national salvation work!

### Science and Poor Youth

— Ji Qian

In our country today, everything requires science. People generally believe that science is different from other disciplines and requires teachers to lecture and adequate equipment for practice to find a path to learning. As a result, society recognizes science as something costly and closely related to financial matters. It seems that poor young people, even if they are naturally inclined towards science and most interested in it, have no opportunity to study science due to their poverty. However, from the perspective of the history of science, this view is not entirely accurate. Wealthy children have many opportunities to study science, but poor children are not entirely limited by money and prevented from entering the halls of learning. The key is to work tirelessly and apply oneself anytime, anywhere. Take Faraday, the great British electrician, for example. He was extremely poor in his youth and worked as a servant in a chemistry lab. However, he was diligent and eager to learn, constantly seeking guidance from Professor Davy. Later, he made contributions that shocked the world. Edison, the great American inventor, whose inventions have benefited humanity, is known to everyone. He started as a poor child who could not attend school and relied on selling newspapers on the street to make a living. One of his ears was injured, leading to lifelong deafness. Anyone who reads his biography knows the difficult circumstances of his youth, yet he was able to focus on pursuing science and ultimately achieved unprecedented success, becoming a great figure in history. From this, we can see that Faraday still had the advantage of being able to seek guidance from others, while Edison had none of these advantages and relied entirely on his own efforts to succeed. I have seen merchants in small grocery stores in America study insects in their spare time and become famous entomologists, writing extensively. Gardeners became plant experts and later became university professors. Servants in museums became experts in geology and paleontology and later became senior technicians at the museum. Servants in chemistry labs became chemistry experts and later became university professors. There are countless such wonderful stories. European and American countries have benefited from science. Their universities and research institutes have certainly contributed greatly, but the efforts of poor young people who have struggled from the bottom are also significant. Poor Chinese students today are advocating for self-study. Let them not be hesitant about science due to difficult circumstances!

### Wireless Radio Tunneling

— Rong Ren

The Panshan Tunnel is a difficult engineering project in modern architecture. However, with the need for tunnels increasing for railroads, water pipes, and fortifications, tunnels must be dug from both ends to be more efficient. However, the direction must be extremely accurate when digging from both ends. Otherwise, even a slight error could lead to significant mistakes. In the past, the direction was determined entirely by surveying instruments, which were not easy to calculate, and the results were not always satisfactory. Now, there is a type of wireless radio direction finder that can guide workers to move forward in the mountains without going astray, allowing them to advance from both ends on the same straight line. Tunnel workers only need to follow the wireless radio signal through the mountain to reach their destination. This method can reduce many of the difficulties in tunneling. The Florence River Tunnel in the United States, which passes through a mountainous range of hard granite and is thirteen miles long, is the longest tunnel in the world. Tunnel workers also used wireless radio as a guide. The meeting point of the workers digging from both ends in the mountain differed by only thirty-six thousandths of an inch. The effectiveness of this can be imagined. Using wireless radio to guide workers to dig tunnels on a straight line.

### Morning Exercises

— Zhang Zhenshan

——A Fragment of a Strong Man's Life

The dawn breaks through the dark night. The fields gradually change color; the leaves and weeds reveal the gentle breath of the morning.

The bugle call broadcasts through the morning breeze, even more solemn and clear in the quiet space. Every strong man is inspired with ambition. We rush into the training ground in the misty morning air, running towards the flag waving in the wind. A group of us march, our feet making a "sasha...shali..." sound. The cinder road is kicked up with black dust, spreading and covering the roadside grass with a layer of black powder.

"Shush! Shush!" Another whistle sounds suddenly, signaling the assembly.

Standing under the flag, we form a long line: attention, alignment... Following the coach's strong voice, we begin our movements. Circular movements, once, twice, three times... Then, more excitedly and intensely, we run, sprint, lie down, charge, and then transform from a whole into parts, and gather the parts into a whole.

After these exercises, we begin to divide into two opposing groups, practicing positional warfare, deploying guerrillas, disrupting the enemy's rear, and assisting the regular army in counterattacks. The use of all our intelligence and strength feels like a real battle situation!

Our discipline and performance are almost equal to that of regular troops; however, we cannot be complacent because we are the reserve force for the current stage of the War of Resistance. We have the responsibility to revive the nation and create a new China! We must be more courageous and determined, and strive towards the goal of national liberation!

The excited group becomes even more excited, raising their strong voices and singing loudly: "For the freedom of our people's survival, we will not hesitate to use our blood, we will not hesitate to use our heads, to fight against the invaders!..."

At this time, the team marches out of the training ground solemnly, with songs. Everyone looks at this beautiful field, bathed in the morning sun, and their hearts are filled with ardent hopes.

### Overseas Chinese are the Mother of Revolution

— You Ji

A Grand Meeting of All Circles in Huiyang Welcoming Representative Zhong

Mr. Zhong Chunsheng, a representative of the Yongyang overseas Chinese who has been traveling and appealing for the salvation of the motherland, led more than 70 young overseas Chinese compatriots back to China to serve the country and arrived in Huizhou on October 9th.

On the 10th, various Huizhou salvation organizations, such as the Huiyang Youth Anti-Japanese Association, the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard, the Huiyang Children's Work Corps, the Orphanage, the Overseas Chinese Return Service Corps, and the Provincial Relief Association, held a joint welcome. This was an unprecedented grand meeting, a major event in Huizhou after the disaster!

This group of outstanding descendants of the Chinese nation, the flames of revenge burning in the blood of each one of them, in order to achieve the goal of revenge, they are willing to spill this passionate blood on the territory of the motherland. Therefore, they abandoned the "banana rain and coconut breeze" of Southeast Asia, abandoned their gentle and beautiful families, and comfortable lives, and resolutely ran back to the battlefield of the motherland, ready to fight against the Japanese!

In the history of the revolution, the overseas Chinese have a glorious history. The success of the Premier's revolutionary cause was indeed greatly aided by the overseas Chinese. Therefore, the Premier said: "Overseas Chinese are the mother of revolution!"

In this sacred national revolutionary war, the overseas Chinese have also fulfilled their great responsibility with a glorious history. Many young overseas Chinese men and women have eagerly returned to the motherland to participate in the front-line killing of the Japanese, rescue work, and rear relief and propaganda work. Batches of pilots and a large number of machine workers have also returned to the motherland to participate in national defense industries or front-line transportation... In short, overseas Chinese are involved in every sector of the War of Resistance. Especially in the economic aspect, it is like a surging spring, constantly assisting the motherland. This proves how much the overseas Chinese love their motherland!

At the meeting, Mr. Zhong reported many valuable facts of overseas Chinese patriotism to us. He said: "The Kuala Lumpur team's return to China this time is unprecedentedly great. Although many overseas Chinese compatriots have returned to China to serve the country in the past, they were all individual. This time, however, it is a large group, which has aroused the sympathy of the overseas Chinese, further aroused the sympathy of international figures, and also aroused the attention of the Japanese and traitors!

"When we left Kuala Lumpur, we met a stateless Jew on the train. He was touched by our patriotic enthusiasm and volunteered to donate 200 yuan. When we were about to leave Singapore, the pier was crowded with thousands and thousands of overseas Chinese compatriots, forming a wall of flesh, raising countless iron arms, and enthusiastically sending us off. On the way back across the ocean, we suddenly received a telegram from the British government saying; the Japanese were going to intercept and inspect us at the port of Qiongzhou, which was told to me by someone on the ship. Later, we changed our route and arrived safely in Hong Kong." This proves that, on the one hand, the aggressors are using all kinds of shameless means to eliminate our various anti-Japanese forces, and on the other hand, our anti-aggression war for justice and peace has won the widespread sympathy of peace-loving people in the world!

He also told a story that made people gratefully shed tears: When he returned to Southeast Asia this time, he was welcomed by overseas Chinese compatriots who cared about the motherland and invited him to speak on the situation of the War of Resistance in the motherland, especially the East River that he had personally seen – the disaster situation of the East River after being ravaged by the Japanese. When he spoke of the countless Huizhou orphans who were homeless, without clothing, and without food, all the overseas Chinese elders, youths, and children were moved to tears. The whole hall sobbed, how sympathetic are the overseas Chinese to the suffering compatriots of the motherland! Mr. Zhong said: "This time I have returned to the motherland, I don't have anything to bring to everyone, only a warm sympathy shared by more than 1.7 million overseas Chinese!" This is such earnest and moving words!

At the same time, he (Mr. Zhong) was conducting fundraising in various ways in Southeast Asia. One day, he went to a mountain village to collect the money that had already been donated, and he happened to meet an overseas Chinese compatriot who came out of the mountain village to buy rice and vegetables. He had promised to donate one dollar. When Mr. Zhong saw him, he turned red in the face and hurriedly unwrapped a paper package he was holding, layer by layer, revealing only one dollar. He took this one dollar and gave it to Mr. Zhong. In this way, he could not buy rice and vegetables, and he went back to the mountain village by himself. Ah! This patriotic enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese is so moving. In order to protect their motherland and not be slaves, they are willing to contribute the food they eat, the clothes they wear, and even their lives to the country and the nation. Their spirit of enduring cold and hunger, and their spirit of sacrificing their families for the sake of the country, is so admirable. We, the people of the motherland, should use our flesh and blood to defend the motherland and repay the patriotic overseas Chinese with action!

Finally, Mr. Zhong also said: "When we issued the call to 'return to the country to serve the country' this time, there were more than 300 young people in Malaya alone who enthusiastically participated. After the examination, 73 were selected. Our selection at that time was not based on the method of imperial examinations, but only asked a few simple questions orally: (1) Are you afraid of death? (2) Can you endure hardship? (3) Will you return to Southeast Asia again? The 73 selected were all very brave and passionate young people, and most of them had done great salvation work in Southeast Asia, such as eradicating hatred and lending movements, and cutting off the ears of traitors. These are all great and heroic facts." Who says that overseas Chinese only contribute money in foreign countries?

"Now the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are holding fundraising events in the form of entertainment. Admission tickets are issued for the entertainment events, and each ticket costs three or four cents, ten yuan, five yuan, or even thousands of yuan. Each entertainment event can raise tens of thousands of yuan. Especially worthy of praise is that the red envelopes that adults give to children during the Lunar New Year are also donated." In short, the overseas Chinese are using various ways to raise funds to help the War of Resistance in order to protect their motherland. This patriotic enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese is glorious and great.

Finally, let us end this article with the words of the Premier:

"Overseas Chinese are the mother of revolution!"

Editorial

### The Belongings of the German and Japanese Invaders Should be shouted

Recently, two trends of the same nature and interconnected have emerged in Europe and the Far East: one is the active deployment of German troops in Danzig, and the other is the reckless and delusional actions of the Japanese army on the Outer Mongolian border. The Japanese and puppet forces have attacked the Soviet Union on the Mongolian-puppet border more than once. This time, they even launched a large-scale air attack on Soviet-Mongolian challenges. Although they have repeatedly failed, they are still unwilling to stop. According to a foreign dispatch from Changchun, Japanese forces are gathering more and more on the border between the puppet Manchukuo and Outer Mongolia, deliberately causing trouble, and disputes are increasing. Japan is also using its past tricks to publicize how the Soviet-Mongolian army is launching a large-scale attack on General's Temple, and that battles are taking place anytime, anywhere, using this as an excuse to attack the Soviet Union. It is no accident that Japan is attacking the Soviet Union at a time when its invasion of China has stalled. The reason is that in Europe, the deployment of Nazi troops and National Socialist Party members in Danzig is gradually being completed, and Danzig has essentially become a wartime scenario. All those of conscription age in Danzig have been enlisted and are wearing German military uniforms in the streets. All barracks are full of troops, and old barracks and old forts are also busy being rebuilt. On the other hand, the German mouthpiece, the German Political Commissioner in Danzig, Forster, released information on the anniversary of the founding of the Nazi local party headquarters, stating that the people of Danzig are willing to merge with Germany and that the merger will be implemented soon. The two aggressors in the East and West are preparing to enjoy the sweetness of their illusions!

However, this sweetness may not be so easy to enjoy again. The Nazis' past good dreams of conquering the East may stumble this time on the stumbling block of Poland! Under the covetous gaze of the Nazi crusaders, Poland has not only resolved to resist to the end, but is also actively preparing to counterattack the aggressors head-on. On the other hand, Britain and France's guarantee to Poland, that is, Poland itself is also convinced: "If Germany uses force to change the political status of Danzig, then Britain and France will inevitably intervene." "The Polish government's official newspaper reprinted news from London and Paris." Various newspapers have also published news that the British and French fleets will sail to the port of Kynia in the North Sea. Poland has also openly declared: "If Germany wants war, we will not avoid fighting a war with it."

In the Far East, the Japanese aggressors, in response to Hitler's planned demands, are actively stirring up trouble in various parts of South China with their navy. ? , While the army is launching an attack on the Soviet Union. The frantic actions of the southernization only expose the weaknesses of the return of light, and the obstacles to its future are far greater than Germany's advance to the east.

However, one point that should be recognized here is that the reckless actions of the two aggressors in the East and West have a common goal, which is to intimidate Britain and take the form of mutual checks and balances. At this time, Britain needs to deeply understand that the threat of the Eastern aggressor is greater than that of the European aggressor. If Britain surrenders to the aggressor in the East, the impact will not only be limited to the loss of interests in the Far East, but will also increase the courage of the Western aggressor. Britain's plan for today is only to show toughness to the Eastern aggressor. If its encirclement and blockade become increasingly tighter, it should take concrete and effective measures to break through it. The Japanese aggressors, wanting to deal with Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and China at the same time, is difficult among difficulties, even if this conflict is still limited to the local area. Taking a step back, Britain can ignore Japan's various unreasonable demands. If Britain agrees to a Japanese demand that is sufficient to hinder China's War of Resistance, then Japan will gain more and more, and Britain will have no foothold in the Far East.

### The War North of the Yellow River Intensifies × Adopts New Strategy to Attack Guerrilla Areas Military Expert Analyzes Recent Battle Situation

[Our Newspaper Xi'an Fourth Dispatch] A military expert said that × is currently making large-scale deployments in China, with the Pinghan, Pingsui, Jinpu, and Tongpu lines all experiencing extremely busy military transport. In the territories of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi, large forces of × troops are launching large-scale offensives against our guerrilla base areas. Their objectives are: (1) to attempt to consolidate their obtained war gains and solidify the puppet regime; (2) to prepare for an offensive in the Northwest. In terms of strategy, × has also abandoned its past "dangerous in-depth" approach and adopted a "step-by-step" approach. Using their superior firepower, they are conducting "leaps forward" from strongholds, building bunkers, and constructing highways, attempting to shrink our guerrilla areas and increase the area of "face" under their occupation. However, although × has increased its forces in China to 35 divisions, implementing what is called a steady and solid approach is still impossible. Our military authorities are confident and have already issued appropriate instructions, and good news will surely arrive soon, it is said.

### After Strict Opium Prohibition Guizhou Prospers Financial Activity Brisk Agricultural Products Sell Well Wu Ding Returns from Inspection and Speaks

[Central News Agency Guiyang Third Dispatch] Wu Xianyu, who inspected various administrative regions of the province, returned to the province yesterday after completing his inspection. He traveled 1,500 kilometers and inspected over 20 counties. Our reporter specially inquired about his impressions.

This is due to the lessons of the × people's two years of aggression.

### Tianjin × Scheduled to Hold Anti-British Rally on July 7th The Blockade of the Concession is More Severe Than Before Poor Residents Face Difficult Living Conditions

[Central News Agency Chongqing Fourth Dispatch] Tianjin News: The entry and exit restrictions of the British and French concessions seem to have been tightened again, resulting in a sharp reduction in the amount of fresh food, dairy products, and coal transported into the concession, almost the same as the time when the blockade was most severe. The living conditions of the poor residents in the concession were originally extremely difficult, and the situation will be even more worrying from now on. "July 7th" is the anniversary of the start of the Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese and their puppet accomplices originally scheduled to hold an anti-British rally here on this day and are now stepping up preparations. In addition, other parts of North China also plan to hold anti-British demonstrations separately to stir up trouble and demand the recovery of foreign concessions in China. Yesterday, various newspapers published anti-British remarks, and radio stations also broadcast anti-British news in the evening. The British and Japanese sides have scheduled negotiations in Tokyo within days. British expatriates here are closely monitoring the situation. British expatriate sentiment is generally very anxious on the one hand and very worried on the other. The general feeling is that if Britain compromises with Japan after Japan's display of its strength, it will greatly damage the prestige and future of Western countries in the Far East.

[Reuters Beijing Third Dispatch] According to Japanese official sources, anti-British rallies have been discovered in Linfen, Lishi, and Hongdong, Shanxi. After the church people in Linfen and Hongdong left, their properties were looted. The British personnel in the above three places are currently on their way back to Beijing. "The reason is probably due to the anti-British movement," it is said.

[Central News Agency London Fourth Dispatch] Yesterday, a member of the Lower House raised questions about the situation in Fuzhou. Undersecretary Butler replied that a plan has been decided to allow British expatriates in Fuzhou who voluntarily evacuate to leave calmly. Although there are no British warships there at present, the other side has agreed to allow British expatriates to pass completely before July 7. It is reported that foreign expatriates in Fuzhou still intend to reside there. Among them are eleven British expatriates. There are indeed similar situations in Wenzhou. The British government has fully expressed its attitude towards the matter. Another member of parliament asked whether the mountain government could decide on a plan to allow the British fleet to visit the Baltic Sea and Leningrad in the Soviet Union. The Undersecretary replied that the government has paid attention to this proposal, but in the short term, this move is unlikely to be practical.

Minister Wang, Vice Minister Xu, and other officials sent greeting cards to congratulate.

### On the Suiyuan Arc

— Kenuo

[Mingge News Agency Correspondence] If we draw a more extensive and detailed map of Suiyuan than usual, we can see that, starting from Wuyuan in the Hetao region, hundreds of schools northwest of Baotou, crossing the Yellow River, passing through the northern tip of the Ikzhao League bordering Datelat Banner and including the four regions of Baoming, then heading east to the portion of land in Tuoketuo County across the river from Shenmu, then stretching south to the Jungar League, and then heading further east to Qingshuihe, we can cut out an arc that is not very regular.

From this, we can clearly see:

(1) The real × troops scattered in Suiyuan number only a little over three thousand. Adding the unreliable puppet troops of De Wang and Li Shouxin numbering ten thousand, and with our various guerrilla bases exerting imperial rule, more troops will not be transferred here. On weekdays, the × troops in the border area are already stretched thin, and this time they are even more flustered.

(2) The strength of our troops stationed on this arc line is very strong. During the Yellow River ice barrier period, × troops were unable to transport ammunition and weapons across the ice. Currently, the Yellow River is vast and the waves are raging. The × troops will not dare to invade easily. If they venture to invade, they will definitely be shattered by the forces of the prepared net. They may not even have a way to retreat.

Especially since General Fu Zuoyi led his troops into western Suiyuan, the momentum of our army has become even more magnificent. With a certain place as the center, our political and military efforts are fiercely attacking the heads of the × people.

Turning back, let us talk about the eastern half of the arc: not only is Jungar Banner and Dongsheng in our grasp, but also a portion of Tuoketuo County and the land on the south bank of the Yellow River in Salacqi County are firmly defended by our soldiers. Besides the county seat, the only places occupied by the × troops are Shamaoying, Jiazihai, and Dachengxikou. However, under the pre-emptive strikes of our eastern guerrilla units, they have become chaotic--our army's guerrilla range, railway bridges destroyed, intercepted bridges, small and large victories, surrounding the people...

This arc, which is not very regular, has become our bastion of resistance.

### Toad Wants to Eat Swan Meat (Part 1) - Japanese Army Tempts and Coerces Us to Make Peace

— Special Correspondent Geng Ya

Japan, at the beginning of its rashly launched war of aggression, was arrogant and self-important, full of confidence that it could make our country yield in a few months. Now, the war has dragged on for two years, and the end is still nowhere in sight. Furthermore, the resistance wars on our northern and southern fronts are becoming stronger, and the evolving international situation is increasingly unfavorable to Japan. The Japanese warlords are panicking due to their internal weakness, and are trying to implement conspiracies and tricks from the spiritual aspect of our people. They scatter many colorful leaflets in various parts of Jin (Shanxi) and Shaanxi provinces and along the Yellow River defense line: either spreading rumors and threats, or using sweet words to entice, blatantly talking nonsense, all with the aim of instigating the people in our war zones to petition the government to make peace with them, these warlords who think they are benevolent and righteous. Unfortunately, clumsy hands can't play good tricks. The graphics and text depicted in these leaflets are ugly and full of jokes, truly not afraid of losing the face of Bushido and making the people of the world split their sides laughing. If you don't believe me, please read the following:

Laughable Absurdity of Boring Leaflets

A leaflet scattered by × people from airplanes in Shanxi province is as follows: on a Chinese map, many "dog skin plasters" are pasted on certain cities, with the note: "In Nanjing and other places, a new pro-Japanese and anti-communist government is established, creating a new world of peaceful and happy life. People, quickly break away from ×××, submit to the new government, and spend a happy new life (?)"

An ordinary person, precisely the 'people' that you, the leaflets, impertinently address, said to the reporter with indignation while pointing at such a leaflet: "No matter how beautifully it speaks, I get angry when I see those Japanese ××."

The × army also uses the name of the fake "Provisional Government" to distribute leaflets regarding the use of fake currency to obtain our Central Bank legal tender. First, they seem to beg like a grandson, almost lifting the "dear people" into the hall. Then, they half-reveal their intention to get their hands on the legal tender: for example, "Therefore, the 'government' has taken measures to prevent the 'dear people' from unexpected losses..." They spare no expense to auction off fake currency at a discount, deceiving the "dear people" into using legal tender to get rid of the fake currency. The impossibility of this wishful thinking is truly as the "dear people" of Shanxi said: to give them life and horses, it's better to be driven away and robbed. Are we worried that we have nowhere to put a few pieces of thin paper (legal tender)!

The × people want to disrupt our finance. In the occupied areas, they also sell a kind of currency, which is a fake coin from the Meiji era, with the words "Made as Currency" already printed on it, but now they are using it again to deceive themselves and others. At first, they forced our compatriots to accept it at a rate of two yuan per coin. Before long, the cunning × people took it back and used traitors to secretly operate in various places, forcing it on our compatriots at a price of several yuan per fake coin, claiming that it could be used as a "pass" or "amulet." Unexpectedly, later, those who were found by the × people to have this coin were falsely accused of being our plainclothes team, and were brutally tortured, forcing them to redeem themselves with heavy money. But no matter how strange it is, the legal tender will not grow wings and fly. It will automatically fly into the pockets of the × people to save the warriors the trouble of using surgery. This, of course, has the same wonderful effect as the intention of the aforementioned leaflet that "Therefore, the 'government' has taken measures to prevent the 'dear people' from unexpected losses."

Another leaflet spreads even more inconceivable rumors: "The Burma Road transportation is destroyed by the air force!" Burma is now a British territory. Which country's air force is said to have destroyed her road? Saying it is from Japan, it probably doesn't dare to; saying it is from Britain itself, it is even more unreasonable. The leaflet is just like an old woman cursing in the street with a bald head and a brainless mouth, which is really unpredictable!

Also, the Zhanggufeng Incident, which is almost coming to an end, almost everyone in the world knows who the troops of the Soviet Union and Japan bowed to and begged for mercy. However, the shameless propagandists are still holding on to the mangy leftover son produced by that battle to boast: "The Japanese army fought a great battle with the Red Army at Zhanggufeng, and the Red Army was defeated, exposing the inferiority of its mechanized troops!" On the leaflet with this slogan, there are also vivid illustrations of the embarrassing situation of the Soviet army's defeat. Goodness, isn't this playing the ridiculous drama of covering your ears while stealing a bell?

There are also several kinds of lithographed color illustrations, the content of which is also very absurd. For example, it is claimed that expelling [Japanese] from the occupied areas is a great immortal who is doing justice for Heaven by glorifying Japan's false occupation of China. On the contrary, all Chinese national heroes who resist Japan are described as ghosts and monsters with blue faces and green eyes! Haha! If this is used to deceive Japanese elementary school students, it may be possible to squeeze out some more candy money, but now it is mistakenly used to preach to our people. Isn't it equivalent to cursing one's father in front of his son? The hatred of killing one's father is irreconcilable, won't it further increase the enemy's hatred in our people's hearts?

This kind of large-format lithographed color book is quite expensive, so on the edge of the leaflet it is written that anyone who tears off this leaflet will be severely punished and will never be forgiven. However, these words are eventually seen by our brave soldiers and civilians, who tear off one for every one they see, and pass them on to the rear as laughing stock.

Incomprehensible Proclamations

There is also the so-called "Imperial Proclamation issued by Haseogi Naohiro, Chief of the Special Service Organ of the Great Japanese Army stationed in Taiyuan," which is particularly adorned with that large red seal of nine characters. The surface material of the seal, the color of the ink, is truly comparable to the golden-edged red lacquer [objects]. Presumably, the chief of the special service, who is like a monkey wearing a hat, has a bit of a misunderstanding, mistakenly believing that the effectiveness of the imperial proclamation depends entirely on the size of the red seal and the thickness of the ink. However, these are not important. The good stuff is still inside the proclamation:

"Investigating the politics of this province, everything is on the right track... No matter how anti-Japanese elements disrupt, I am afraid it will not help the overall situation." On the one hand, he boasts that politics is on the right track, and on the other hand, he says that anti-Japanese elements continue to disrupt, and uses the questioning tone of "I am afraid" to look forward to the overall situation. This is obviously slapping himself in the face. The following sentence says: "Those who wish to cooperate should swear to the military and political authorities near them to express their sincere support for the new regime, and to defeat the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and faithfully be pro-Japanese!" The beauty of its grammar is truly unspeakable; because faithful pro-Japanese elements are also among those to be defeated.

Another proclamation, issued by someone calling himself the "Commander of the Great Japanese Army in Yuci," only needs to have the words "in Yuci Great Japanese" taken out and the grammar of the former "Great Japanese stationed in Taiyuan" measured against it, and you can know that the two gentlemen are of the same ilk. The title of this proclamation is: "Telling the military and civilians in Shanxi Province who are trembling with hunger and cold due to Chiang's deceitful policies and inhumane behavior," the obscurity of which can truly confuse people's brains. The brilliance of its content is even worthy of creating a new era in invasion literature! For example: (To be continued)

### Soviet Reply Delivered - Britain and France Are Studying It - Soviet Officials Express Optimism - Believing Negotiations Can Be Completed

(Reuters, Moscow, 4th) Officials here claim that the progress between Britain and the Soviet Union in overcoming the difficulties of negotiation is very rapid, and it is believed that in the near future, the tripartite agreement can be negotiated to completion.

(Reuters, London, 4th) Foreign Secretary Halifax and several of his experts are now studying the Soviet Union's reply to the Anglo-French proposal. The British and French cabinets also maintain close cooperation.

(Reuters, Paris, 4th) The French government received the Soviet Union's reply to the Anglo-French proposal today, and it is currently being studied by Foreign Minister Bonnet and several experts. It is reported that Molotov, in the reply, requested to obtain more information on several points of the Anglo-French draft. In this situation, it is generally expected that the Anglo-Soviet negotiations will take some time to complete.

(Reuters, Moscow, 3rd) British and French representatives met with Molotov today for an hour and a half. After the meeting, the British and French representatives continued to exchange views at the British Embassy. It is reported that Molotov handed over the Soviet reply to the recent British and French suggestions to the British and French representatives, but the contents are not detailed.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 3rd] Molotov, at 4 pm today, continued to discuss the mutual assistance agreement with Seeds, Strang, Naggiar, until 5:30 pm. Molotov immediately handed over the Soviet government's reply to the new Anglo-French proposal to the British and French ambassadors. The contents of the reply have not been published. According to informed sources, the gist of the reply was explained in detail by Molotov yesterday and is now confirmed in writing. According to today's talks, both sides' attitudes were very frank and will continue to hold talks. In addition, the Baltic states, namely Finland, Latvia, and Estonia, still oppose any guarantee that has not been obtained with their consent in advance. However, according to people from these countries here, Britain and France intend to satisfy the Soviet Union's demands and provide guarantees regardless of their opposition.

### No New Developments in Danzig - Polish Government to Issue Note - German Officials Exert Themselves to Cover Up

[Central News Agency, London, 4th] Chamberlain made a statement in the House of Commons yesterday on the Danzig issue, saying that according to reliable sources, military measures are being carried out in the Free City of Danzig, which is very tense. Recently, there has been a large influx of Germans disguised as tourists to Danzig, and the number is increasing daily. At the same time, a local defense force, known as the Stormtroopers, has been established in the Free City. The Polish government has received a notification from the German government that the German cruiser "Königsberg" will visit Danzig from August 25 to 28. Regarding the development of the situation in Danzig, the British government is maintaining close contact with the Polish and French governments.

(Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 4th) Polish diplomatic representative to Danzig, Chodacki, returned to Danzig today after staying here for a few days. It was announced here that the Polish government will send a new note to the Danzig Senate regarding "certain incidents found in Danzig territory."

[Central News Agency, Danzig, 4th] Polish High Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, recently returned here from Warsaw. It is generally believed that he intends to issue a statement explaining why the Danzig authorities violated the Danzig-Polish agreement, so many are eagerly awaiting it. However, it is also possible that this statement will be issued directly from Warsaw. "Also," the situation in Danzig remains extremely calm on the surface. The League of Nations High Commissioner to Danzig recently told a Reuters reporter that he is doing his best to maintain peace, and that the most dangerous thing is the wrong reporting of facts.

[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] German political circles discussed Chamberlain's speech on the Danzig issue with a Reuters interviewer tonight, saying that "Chamberlain should be more cautious about the source of his information." There have not been any illegal or extraordinary military activities in Danzig, but only the reorganization and expansion of its police, which is absolutely within Danzig's autonomy. It is true that a large number of German tourists are visiting Danzig, but it is a big mistake to point to them as disguised troops, as Chamberlain did. Senior officials of the National Socialist Party expressed surprise at Britain's continued use of "blank checks" to provoke Poland's "radical and arrogant behavior." They further said that the situation would be better if the British Labor Party had appealed to Poland instead of Germany. Officials were extremely angry at Britain's appeal, saying it was an act of inducing nationals to commit treason. Both the press and officials took a disdainful attitude towards the "fear" in Paris and London. However, no one denied that the fate of Danzig had been decided, and the only question was the timing. The key lies in the hands of Hitler alone.

### Bartlett Writes - Hitler Will Not Take Risks for Now

[Reuters, London, 4th] According to the opinion of Bartlett, the foreign affairs interviewer of the "News Chronicle," there will be no war over Danzig. The rumors of changes in Danzig last weekend were a test of Britain's reaction by the National Socialist Party. Bartlett pointed out that this reaction will induce Hitler to take his next adventure in other directions. He also believes that the Poles will do everything they can to avoid war, except for maintaining territorial integrity and national honor. "If the Danzig Senate decides to vote to return to Germany or declare Danzig residents as German citizens, the Polish government will probably not take any other action other than lodging an official protest, because any amendment to the Danzig constitution is illegal without the approval of the League of Nations. But when Poland's treaty rights in Danzig are interfered with, the Poles will stand up and resist." Regarding the future situation in Danzig, opinions are divided. The various newspapers are discussing Poland's offer to Danzig of a note requesting an explanation for the military measures. It is reported that the British Ambassador to Poland will fly back to Warsaw today after meeting with Halifax yesterday.

### Hitler Inspects Air Force Station

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 4th] On Sunday, the German leader visited the air force training site in Lilinde. At that time, Aviation Minister General Göring was present to welcome him. Lieutenant General Ader explained the various new types of aircraft to the leader in detail. It is reported that among those who accompanied Hitler to inspect were all the officers of the air force and many important figures of the National Socialist Party.

### Roosevelt Concerned About European Situation

[Reuters, New York, Hyde Park, 4th] According to reports from interviewers, President Roosevelt is extremely concerned about the possibility of war in Europe. It is said that President Roosevelt believes that the House of Representatives' rejection of the removal of the arms embargo act will promote the outbreak of war.

### Many Accidental Deaths on US Independence Day

### South Manchuria Railway - Military Train Collides with Passenger Train - 500 Japanese Soldiers Injured and Killed - Conflicts Continue on the Border Between Mongolia and the Puppet Regime

[Chongqing Central News Agency, 3rd] Shanghai News, on the 1st, a northbound military train on the South Manchuria Railway collided with a southbound passenger train, injuring and killing more than 500 soldiers, and killing hundreds of Korean passengers.

[London, 3rd] The Japanese Embassy in London issued a communique today, stating that regarding the recent border conflicts in Outer Mongolia, it said that at the end of last week, it launched a large-scale attack on the Soviet-Mongolian army. This action was "in fact a necessary self-defense action due to the repeated provocations of the Soviet-Mongolian army." The communique stated that the Japanese army had no other intention than to ensure border security.

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 4th] The Tokyo interviewers of various countries have gone to inspect the outbreak of the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border dispute, including six interviewers from Havas News Agency.

### Henderson Returns Home Due to Illness

[Central News Agency London, 4th] It was officially announced that Ambassador to Germany Henderson's illness is serious, and he is scheduled to return here within a few days to seek medical treatment. At that time, he will visit Halifax.

### Germany Denies Papen's Trip to the Soviet Union

[Central News Agency Berlin, 3rd] It was rumored that the German government intended to send a certain communique to the governments of Britain and France, and that German Ambassador to Turkey Papen was on a secret mission to Moscow. People in political circles here have denied this.

### Bishop Yu Bin Arrives in Chicago

(Central News Agency, Chicago, 3rd) Bishop Yu Bin arrived here today and was warmly welcomed by the local overseas Chinese. The local overseas Chinese held a general mobilization meeting today, with more than 4,000 people attending, chaired by Mei Youcai (transliteration), and speeches were given by Commissioner Xiao Jishan and Yu Bin. Chinese Consul General Lu Ziqin also attended the meeting.

### Before Tokyo Negotiations - Japanese Side Asks for the Sky-High Price - Actually Wants Britain to Stop Aiding China - British Side Still Holds a Spirit of Compromise

[Reuters, Tokyo, 4th] British Ambassador to Japan Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita today to discuss the agenda of the Tianjin issue conference and prepare everything. Craigie told reporters that he was neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the meeting. He will do his best to bring the talks to a satisfactory conclusion, and hopes that the Japanese side will also make the same efforts.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] The attitude of the Japanese military towards the future negotiations between Britain and Japan was explained yesterday by a military spokesman. It is said that the Japanese army first demanded that Britain agree to stop aiding the Chiang Kai-shek government, otherwise the negotiations between the two countries would be meaningless. Britain should change its policy to adapt to the new situation in the Far East and should express its understanding of the attitude taken by the Japanese army in Tianjin. The spokesman solemnly stated that from the beginning of the blockade of Tianjin, all the steps taken by the local Japanese authorities have been fully approved and praised by senior officials in Tokyo.

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 4th] In the "Enlighten the People's Understanding of Britain" propaganda campaign here, a so-called Japanese Reform Party issued a declaration demanding that the Japanese government take a tougher attitude to deal with Britain, saying that the Japanese government should always remember that Britain and the Soviet Union are obstacles to Japan in carrying out its Far East mission. If Japan agrees to any concessions or leaves fundamental issues unresolved, the construction of a new order in East Asia will be doomed to failure.

House of Commons Questions Anglo-Japanese Disputes

(Reuters, London, 3rd) Undersecretary of State Butler stated in the House of Commons today that Foreign Secretary Halifax has received a report regarding the death of British national Mr. Liddell, the principal of the Lester School of Technology in Shanghai, in a car accident. As for what action the government will take on this matter, it cannot be announced until it has been fully considered. However, the British Consul General in Shanghai has submitted a note to the Japanese Consul General, declaring a reservation of all rights. The Undersecretary then answered a question raised by Labour Party member Borlase regarding the establishment of the pseudo-Huaxing Bank and its impact on commerce, saying that the British government is closely monitoring the situation with the relevant departments. When asked about the four Chinese people who caused the Tianjin incident, the Undersecretary replied that the Tokyo negotiations are about to begin, and he cannot make any further statements other than the original announcement. Labour Party member Burke asked whether the British authorities would never hand over the four Chinese to the Japanese side unless they were proven to have committed murder. The Undersecretary replied that this is one of the issues to be discussed in the Tokyo negotiations, and denied that the British government had canceled its statement that it would not extradite the four Chinese unless proven guilty. Labour Party member Greenwood also requested the government to guarantee that the four Chinese would never be extradited to the Japanese side before the Tokyo negotiations were completed. Butler replied that the government had no intention of extraditing them before the negotiations. Regarding the situation on Gulangyu Island, Butler said that the new suggestions made by the Japanese Consul General to the Gulangyu Municipal Council are currently being considered. As for Fuzhou and Wenzhou, the British authorities have now prepared everything so that British expatriates who wish to leave can evacuate. Although there are no British ships at the mouth of the Minjiang River in Fuzhou, the Japanese Navy has agreed to prepare transportation to transport British expatriates who wish to evacuate by July 6. Foreign Secretary Halifax heard that foreign expatriates in Wenzhou had decided not to evacuate, including eleven British expatriates. Mr. Creech asked whether these ports had been blockaded. Undersecretary Butler replied that the actual blockade had been realized, and the British government's attitude towards this matter had also been clarified to the Japanese side.

[Reuters, London, 3rd] In view of the fact that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations are about to begin in Tokyo, Upper House member Lord Cecil, at the request of Foreign Secretary Halifax, temporarily postponed the question he had originally scheduled to raise in the Upper House on Thursday. The question was to require the government to report on the situation in the Far East. Once raised, it would inevitably cause a wide-ranging debate.

### Baltic States to Devalue Currencies - To Resist German Economic Power - Britain and France Exchanging Opinions

"Central News Agency London, 2nd" Sources here claim that the countries in Central Europe, especially Poland and Romania, whose independence is guaranteed by Britain, will implement currency devaluation. The reason is that the prices of raw materials and manufactured goods produced in these countries are too high to compete with the products of the United States, Africa, the Scandinavian Peninsula, or the East. As a result, it is inevitable that they will establish goods exchange agreements with Germany and be controlled by German economic power. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the prices of various products as soon as possible, and currency devaluation will surely have the effect of adjustment. In addition, the freedom of Central European products to be transferred to countries with free exchange and the impact of import quotas have made it impossible to develop, which is also one of the reasons for the economic difficulties of Central European countries. In addition, there are various political factors that can also cause Central European countries to embark on the path of currency devaluation. The reason is that Poland and Romania have consulted with Britain on borrowing loans, but so far the British Treasury has only granted part of them, which the two Baltic countries consider insufficient. Poland said that it could not afford to buy raw materials needed for its military industry, while Romania said that it could not resist Germany's economic power. Experts from the British Department of Finance advocated lending money to the two Baltic countries to establish an exchange balance fund to maintain their currency status, while reducing the currency price to increase exports, and the money obtained could also increase prices in the industrial manufacturing and investment aspects. Regarding this matter, Britain and France are exchanging opinions with the governments of various related countries, and it is expected to be completed in a short period of time.

### British Aid China Association Launches "China Week"

[Central News Agency London, 4th] The British Aid China Association recently launched "China Week" here to mobilize British public opinion to jointly aid China, and specially published a daily newspaper for this purpose, named "China News." Yesterday, the newspaper had an editorial written by the well-known novelist Plichta, which said that we must find a way to prevent British policy from benefiting the rapacious aggressors. On the contrary, we should make it aid the hardworking and persevering [Chinese people]. Yesterday, China News also published special articles by Chinese Chairman Chiang, [text missing] Consul General James, and leaders from India and Malaysia, with very vivid content. Also, a mass meeting is scheduled to be held here tomorrow, chaired by Sir Lee [text missing].

Short Commentary

### US Independence Day

Yesterday, July 4th, was the 163rd anniversary of the American Revolutionary War. At that time, the American people fought for liberation and freedom. After setbacks, they finally relied on the perseverance of the entire nation and its leaders and achieved final victory. Thus, the democratic, republic, free, and happy United States of America was born. Today, besides admiring the spirit of the American people shedding blood for freedom, we deeply feel that the American people's spirit of persisting in unity and fighting to the end is truly worthy of our emulation. Currently, North American democracy and freedom are also under threat from the fierce flames of fascist invaders. The heroic resistance of the Chinese nation has reached two years, and we especially hope that the two major nations will join hands closely and fight together! Furthermore, unite with friendly nations such as Britain and the Soviet Union to jointly defend democracy, peace, and justice and strike against the invaders.

### Mongol-Puppet War

Yesterday's evening newspaper reported that the Mongol-puppet war is showing signs of escalating. The Soviet Union, in accordance with the mutual assistance agreement, is providing assistance to Outer Mongolia to resist Japanese provocation. Our North China armies, centered on the XX army, have launched a counter-offensive, and guerrilla warfare in the four northeastern provinces is also intensifying. If this news is reliable, it will naturally be beneficial to the war of resistance. The Japanese invasion force in China was already insufficient. Now, if they put on a show of strength on the international stage and "implement anti-Soviet" actions, only to find themselves unable to extricate themselves, then even if they are not completely annihilated, the result of reinforcing the north will be the emptying of the southern battlefield!

However, we must recognize that the Japanese will inevitably try their best to avoid a major war in the north. The current provocations are merely conspiracies before negotiations with Britain, and conspiracies before Wang's regime advances to form a puppet government. Therefore, we must not be too careless! We must prepare to meet the leaping operations of the X people, and we must step up our counter-offensive in central China and southern China, especially in the rear of the X people!

### Serving the Nation Through Prostitution

The "Tourist Guide" agencies in Hong Kong have launched a "charitable guide" movement "in commemoration of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction", which is "resonating with a hundred responses" and is in full swing. We feel that the patriotic behavior of these "guide girls" should be as worthy of respect as the charitable sales of hawkers.

However, we have always been skeptical of this movement of "serving the nation through licentiousness"! We have always been skeptical that only elementary school students, hawkers, singing girls, and guide girls are passionately patriotic, while why is there so little news of wealthy businessmen generously donating ships? ×××××××××, this is the shame of the entire "upper class" society! This is especially the shame of the so-called ×× Chinese! Look in the mirror! What qualifications do you have to look down on these "lower class" people? Search your conscience! Can't you see the example of the Jews?

### Danzig and World Peace

— Dong Ping

The original author of this article, Dr. Rauschning, was the former President of the Senate of the Free City of Danzig; he resigned in November 1934 and is still a key member of the Nazi party. He has unique insights on the Danzig issue, which are by no means comparable to those of Forster and Ribbentrop. Moreover, from this article, it can be seen that justice is in the hearts of the people, and it cannot be completely covered up by Hitler alone.

The Danzig issue can be properly resolved. A fair resolution is sufficient to determine the peace of Europe; however, before proceeding with the resolution, all parties concerned must provide friendly guarantees.

Before Hitler came to power, the situation in Danzig had shown good signs. If the Nazis had not come to power, Danzig might have already been returned to Germany; because at that time, Europe would have laid a foundation for mutual cooperation under the General Military Conference and the peace treaty. However, the biggest difficulty now is that Europe has become a place of arms race and mutual hatred.

Indeed, before the war, Danzig belonged to Germany; and had ruled in this way for several centuries. However, another fact cannot be ignored; when Danzig belonged to Germany and Prussia, the country of Poland did not exist at the same time; naturally, there was no need for Danzig to serve as a seaport. At that time, most of Poland was subordinate to Russia, and Russia had its own seaports, so naturally there was no need to choose a free city. However, after the war, Poland was officially established, and she naturally needed a seaport.

Whether observed geographically or politically, Danzig is ultimately a whole. Germany and Poland cannot split it at all, because that kind of split will not only be unhelpful to peace, but will also cause explosions on both sides.

No matter how much the public Germans hope to be merged into Germany, the important thing is: if Danzig falls into the hands of imperialist Nazis, Danzig will definitely become an important naval base for Germany, which will fundamentally destroy Poland's only seaport in Gdynia, and completely block Poland's access to the sea. Finally, the Polish Corridor will be forced out of discussion. In this way, it is tantamount to dividing Polish territory and cutting off Poland's prospects on the world stage.

Therefore, Hitler's political means are the most unsuitable for solving the Danzig issue. Until today, his policy is still to incorporate the free city into Germany, on the grounds that Danzig has already been Germanized. However, since his occupation of Prague, this reason is no longer valid.

A few years ago, I had the opportunity to listen to the Führer personally explain the eastward policy—the so-called eastern space. That is, Germany wants to rule a series of semi-autonomous countries in the east, and control them with political and military alliances. They must serve as appendages and supporters of Germany's economic and political institutions. German rural areas completely obtain labor from foreign countries, and general precision work is assigned to the German people, so that superior German people can rule inferior semi-autonomous people, and achieve permanent order and peace in Eastern Europe. These semi-autonomous countries include the Baltic states, Poland, Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and then Czechoslovakia. This is a political system that superficially resembles the League of Nations, but is completely under the oligarchy of Germany; it has become Hitler's diplomatic and political line. Moreover, since the establishment of the protectorates of Moravia and Bohemia, this plan has gradually unfolded.

Hitler completely agreed with this theory, but he slightly modified it for the border countries. He said that the artificial people of the border countries should be moved away, so that German farmers could migrate to colonize. At the same time, he pointed out that Moravia, Bohemia, Pomerania, Upper Silesia are extremely important areas, while Lithuania and the Baltic states, Hitler believes, are easier to control.

This plan is the real background for Hitler's demand to merge Danzig and build a highway in the Polish Corridor. His real purpose is not a free city of Danzig, but to implement the entire conquest plan. Destroying Poland, the only strong country in the east, is necessary. Poland must fall to the status of a medium-sized country, becoming a land of 15 million people. Hitler had already said when telling the German people: Germany must do everything possible to prevent another military power from being produced in its east. In terms of military factors, defeating Poland is Germany's most dominant and most urgent goal.

Some Germans naturally praised these plans enthusiastically. But as a whole, the public is really not interested. They oppose adding pressure to other countries and peoples, because the result of this plan is really the end of Eastern Europe. This may be a remedy for the excessive complexity of European countries, but the method is really too uncivilized, it is completely based on force and coercion.

Now, we cannot but honestly admit that countries and people all over the world are already tired of the quarrels of nationalism. Now is a good time to re-establish an international order, an order in which the League of Nations and passive collective security only completed the first step. The only way to stop the Nazi's military advance is to jointly declare respect for the independence and autonomy of some small countries. A federal organization of European countries, based on freedom and unity, will surely resist Hitler's military rule.

For six years, Europe has been in constant turmoil, entirely due to the danger of Hitler's policies. All treaties concluded with Germany not only failed to resolve disputes, but became a fuse for conflicts between the two sides. Even if the Danzig issue can be temporarily resolved now, it is just planting a fuse for the future, and the distance between this resolution and the next outbreak will not exceed six months at most.

### Secrets of a Tourist Guide - I am a Tourist Guide Girl

How did I become a tourist guide girl? I was tricked into it. Before, I was helping with work in people's homes—to be honest, I used to be a maid, but the name "maid" is too inelegant and undignified. So, now, except in front of close friends like you, I absolutely refuse to reveal my past history.

Maybe, I am as people criticize me, "naturally flirtatious"! I helped several families, but I was soon fired by the female employers. The reason was always that I had too many boyfriends, but who doesn't know their narrow minds, isn't it because the male employer looked at me a few more times, and they got jealous and took such a cruel action?

In order not to suffer these grievances, relying on the fact that I also read a few books when I was young, I wanted to find a more noble job. At that time, a few friends introduced me to be a tourist guide girl. I asked them, is this a "noble" job? They said a lot of things, and I couldn't quite distinguish what they were, anyway, a hundred sentences always add up to one sentence: tourist guide girl is the most "noble" profession. This still couldn't move my heart. Later, one sentence made me wholeheartedly willing to be a tourist guide girl. Do you know what sentence? They said: The tourist guide business is so developed in "foreign countries", isn't it "noble"? Right, what foreigners do, I think is always "noble". In this way, I became a tourist guide girl.

The rule of our tourist guide agency for going out for "guiding" is one dollar per hour, but most customers don't "dare" to call us at home, they always go to hotels and restaurants. Therefore, out of our one dollar, we have to give two dimes to the waiters who call us. This money must not be saved or begrudged, because if you offend these "bloodsuckers", they will really make trouble, and you can forget about doing business there a second time. So, can I earn eight dimes per hour when I go out? Wait, wait, we still have to split it up, why don't the bosses of the tourist guide agency take money? Therefore, these eight dimes still have to be given to them. This splitting is of several types, depending on which level the tourist guide girl is. Most of them are split two-six, that is, the boss takes two dimes and she gets six dimes. There are also three-five, half-and-half, as for me, it's really infuriating, I have a two-six split, the boss takes six dimes, but I can only get two dimes. It is said that I am the lowest level, because, first, I am not beautiful enough! You must not believe his nonsense, I look in the mirror myself, and I am not much worse than those so-called top levels, maybe even better than them, but since ancient times, there have been too few people who know "goods"! Second, I can't dance. This statement should also be beaten. What is so difficult about dancing? Anyway, I am tall and strong. As long as I am happy to dance, I guarantee that I can pull the customer and dance around. Third, I have not attended elementary school for a year or two, and cannot pretend to be a female student - those damned guys! They have completely forgotten that I have recited the Three Character Classic and the Hundred Family Surnames, in short, if it weren't for my innate flirtatious energy, I would almost be rejected as a tourist guide girl, but let's not worry about that, let's talk about our situation when we go out. Those top-level girls mostly have some regular customers who often make calls or ask people to ask her by name, but sometimes they can't be separated, what should they do? Then it's my turn to go. The customer called her, regardless of the situation, I go. When I get there, the customer is of course surprised, what's going on, who changed the person? But I just pretend not to know and let them shout. If some customers honestly ask: I called so-and-so, why didn't she come, but you came? Then I pretend to be surprised and say, did you not call me? That must be that we heard the name wrong. If they ask my name, of course, my name is only different from the person he identified by a very difficult to distinguish tone, they naturally have no choice but to let me sit down or send me away, anyway, one dollar always has to be taken out, this thing is called: "Li Dai Tao Jiang."

Some people say that being a tourist guide girl is not as clean as being a maid, because earning money by physical strength is more "noble" than exchanging money by relying on enchanting charm. But now, we don't care about "nobility" anymore. I think that being a maid, being busy all day long, being clean is clean, but how can it compare to now, seeing people every day, who are managers, big bosses, bank clerks, etc., some high-class people. We have a good time with them, making them very happy. If you are a maid, although you have a clean heart, who cares about you! So, I think that anyway, those self-proclaimed dignified people love this tune, and we are happy to ignore what is clean, what is soul, and grab a few unjust dollars first. What do you say, am I right!

### One Person Per Day

Everyone knows that German Iron Chancellor Bismarck was a famous swordsman and fencer.

Once, when old Bismarck was still young! He had a dispute with the then German scientist Virchow, for some reason. The standard soldier arrogantly proposed a duel: "You can choose the weapon."

Although Professor Virchow was buried in the laboratory and had no strength to restrain a chicken, he did not want to be outdone. He hardened his scalp and accepted the challenge and agreed to meet later.

The day of the duel finally arrived. The onlookers were worried about the weak Virchow, because he could not withstand Bismarck's blow. However, Professor Virchow calmly took out his weapon from his pocket and shouted loudly to the Iron Chancellor:

"These are two sandwiches, which are also the weapons for you and me to duel. One of them contains the most poisonous toxin. After eating it, I guarantee you won't survive, but the other one is absolutely harmless. Please choose one, and I will eat the other one. Our chances are exactly the same, this is absolutely fair. Come on! My friend!"

This time, the Iron Chancellor was frightened. Although he was a hero, he was not used to this kind of weapon after all. Finally, he had no choice but to smile and shake hands with Professor Virchow and cancel the scheduled duel. ·Bismarck·

Mr. Earth; Guide girl, please guide me to find a piece?

Clean land; Okay?

Guide girl; Ah, you should go to Antarctica to play!

### Weather Station

The Tokyo negotiations have not yet opened the curtain, but those who blow the trumpet, beat the gong, set up the scenery, and match the lights, are so busy that they forget everything, stopping aid to China, understanding the actions of the Japanese army, Tokyo approving, being tough on Britain... This can't help but remind people of Munich a year ago. Old Hee led two Gs, made a big battle, and finally caught a rainy X. Is he going to fish in the Far East again this time? Say it again: China is definitely not Czech,

Mr. Adolf Hitler, the Polish guards have already loaded their bullets, do you want to try one? Ha! You have also found the word "fear" in the dictionary, maybe you will open your mouth wide again; I don't want to do it now; I am setting up the scenery for Tokyo; "Okay, good for you,

### Believe it or not

The famous British psychologist Ellis, in order to study the psychology of men and women talking, specially went to the streets and alleys every day to investigate and recorded the conversation materials he eavesdropped on one by one. The survey results are as follows:

### Small Problem

Here is a very old story: Once upon a time, the wind was gentle and the sun was warm. King Solomon was walking in the Royal Garden. Passing by the flower bed, he heard a male butterfly say to his wife, "As long as his wings tremble slightly, the palace gate of King Solomon will be opened." King Solomon heard this and was greatly angered by what he was saying. He immediately returned to the palace to summon the ministers and ordered them to quickly capture and punish the butterfly who had no regard for the law. A few minutes later, the prisoner, whose face was pale and trembling all over, lay prostrate before the emperor. At the end of the trial, the butterfly confessed his guilt, but he requested the emperor to let him say one more sentence: "Dignified Emperor, you are also a married person yourself, can you guess why I want to say this to my wife?"

King Solomon deserves to be wise, and after a little thought, he understood. At the moment, he was very understanding and released the butterfly. It is said that after the male butterfly returned home, his wife asked him what it was like to see the emperor. The butterfly replied calmly and casually, "King Solomon asked me not to damage his palace."

Readers must be smarter than Solomon, can you guess why the male butterfly said this to his wife?

### Sea Forum 24

— Written by Captain Lawton Translated by Yang Bi

Previous summary

In the autumn of 1914, Jack, the radio operator of the Hawkes Shipping Company, and Bill, the mechanic, took advantage of the German ship to travel in Europe. Because Britain and Germany declared war, the British warship was going to intercept the ship. The ship escaped wildly. Easily escaped the tiger's mouth. Returned to American territory. Jack and Bill went back to New York to see Qiu. Qiu asked them to take the "Saint Mark" to Europe to find his son. On the ship, Jack refused to send a coded telegram for a man named Johnson. It turned out that the guy was a German spy named Raviki...

"I don't know any more than you. I haven't seen him since we parted at the station from White Port to New York. In fact, things went so fast that I didn't have time to think about him. He told me that he was going to catch the first ship to France."

"Okay, let's talk about old Fried Chicken again. Are you going to report him?"

"Who to report to?"

"Tell the captain right away."

"What's the point? He hasn't committed any crime. As long as he doesn't bother us, he's happy to travel under a changed name. We can't control him."

"That's true. However, even so, if another British cruiser comes up to investigate, I'm going to say a few words to him." Bill said worriedly.

"I hope to know who that Smith and Zhi is?"

"Is he on the passenger list?"

"No, otherwise, the officers from the 'Borwick' would have asked him. He paid special attention to names with German sounds."

"So," Bill nodded, "he is also taking a risk on this ship. I guess old Fried Chicken's friend must also have a name with an American sound, so that he can safely cross this ocean."

Before long, Jack returned to the radio room, where his berth was; as he approached the door of the radio room, the door was open, and some pale yellow light was coming from inside. Jack saw, or rather he thought, that there were two figures behind a lifeboat, but by the time he wanted to see clearly, they were gone.

At that time, Jack assumed that they were two sailors on the ship, but as they slipped through a passage door, they could see that they were wearing ordinary clothes, not the uniforms of the sailors.

"Strange." He said to himself, "These two people are hanging around the radio room, obviously with bad intentions; otherwise, why would they run away when they saw me coming. I'm willing to bet a cake of cooked cakes, those two guys must be old Fried Chicken, and his treasure who knows radio. Jack, old buddy, you have to open your eyes a little."

"Did you do anything?" He asked Malan as soon as he entered the radio room.

"Nothing, as quiet as the morning of the first day of the Lunar New Year."

"Didn't you see any old friends of ours just now?"

"Who, Johnson? No, he hasn't been here."

Jack nodded, said good night, and went to sleep. However, as the ship sailed at night, his eyes were not willing to close as comfortably as usual and fall asleep.

He was busy with many things in his heart. Obviously, Raviki wanted some things in the radio. However, as far as Jack knew, what he heard behind the steam cylinder was just some words. He thought it was his responsibility to stop it.

### Zhejiang Tea Management Methods

— Feng He Fa

Last year, the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance, upon orders, handled the unified sales of tea nationwide, establishing the initial foundation for wartime agricultural policy. This year, to fundamentally transform tea production, manufacturing, transportation, and sales, the Ministry of Finance submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for the promulgation of general organizational rules for tea industry management agencies in each province. These rules would enable the establishment of tea industry management agencies in each province to connect with the Trade Commission for further advancement. Zhejiang Province established the Oil, Tea, Cotton, and Silk Management Office in March of this year, collaborating with the Construction Department and central government agencies. While the internal details of each department differed, the tea aspect involved signing a loan-for-tea contract with the Trade Commission, tasking the Tea Department of the Management Office with handling improvements in production, manufacturing, and transportation. Director Wu of the Construction Department concurrently served as the office director, with Mr. Fei Hongnian and Mr. Liu Baochen as deputy directors. I was entrusted with overseeing the affairs of the Tea Department. Because the unified sales of tea had been the most effective special product since the war of resistance, Mr. Zou Bingwen and Mr. Wu Juenong of the Trade Commission had already formulated detailed plans for the overall transformation of the tea industry and its coordination with the war effort. Zhejiang tea industry management followed the established policy, taking into account local special circumstances, and gradually advanced. The general situation is outlined as follows:

(1) Four Major Goals

Wartime tea industry policy has four goals: First, to secure materials as part of mobilizing material resources, with the aim of preventing them from falling into enemy hands and concentrating the scattered forces previously controlled by private individuals. Second, to enhance finance and earn foreign exchange, which is the concrete content of securing materials. This requires the government to coordinate transportation and sales and increase exports for success. Third, to stabilize rural areas and increase tea production to enrich the economic condition of farmers, balance various interests, and improve farmer organizations. This is not only required by wartime economic policy but also a method of promoting public organization. Fourth, to fundamentally transform the entire tea production system as a contribution to resisting aggression and building the nation. Under normal circumstances, countless man-made difficulties would obstruct the improvement of the tea industry. During this wartime period, some social evils disappear with the war, creating an opportunity for the tea industry to resist aggression and build the nation.

(2) Four Steps

The advancement of wartime tea industry policy, according to production steps, is divided into the following four stages: First, improve production and benefit farmers. Currently, tea farmers' planting of tea trees and picking of raw tea are extremely scattered and rudimentary, lacking technical knowledge. While this seems to be the main cause, it is actually because mountain prices are not guaranteed, making it difficult to profit, and poverty is a concern, making it difficult to expand production and improve technology. Therefore, the key to the problem is how to maintain good prices for raw tea and prevent exploitation. Second, secure tea factories and improve manufacturing. Because today's tea factories in various places are not only rudimentary but also often approach speculation, manufacturing intermittently without long-term plans, this is due to the failure to rationalize transportation and sales mechanisms and the lack of market guarantees. Factories that are exploited by intermediaries will inevitably pass on the burden to tea farmers, creating layer upon layer of exploitation, inevitably leading to mutual destruction. Third, reduce intermediaries and eliminate malpractices. The original comprador-like commission tea shops collude with foreign firms to oppress tea factories, with heavy malpractices and numerous items, and the decline of the tea industry is truly severe. Fourth, direct trade and increase exports. This is the final issue for commodity agricultural products. Without a sales market, improving the tea industry is out of the question. However, if direct trade is not possible and control remains with foreign firms, there is no way to expand the market. (To be continued)

### Classical Chinese and Modern Chinese

— Yang Jin Hao

The writing of an era expresses the spirit of that era. The content (views) and form (tone) of writing should conform to the spirit of the era; this has become common sense.

However, much of the writing popular in our country today has not even achieved this common sense. Some people are modern people, but they insist on using classical Chinese to write classical Chinese views. Some people use classical Chinese to write modern views, and some use modern Chinese to write ancient views. The first is equivalent to walking corpses, the second is equivalent to modern living ghosts, and the third is equivalent to the disguised makeup of mummies; none of them are worthy of being called true "modern Chinese" - the writing of the new era.

Currently, what is especially popular is a type of writing that has a modern soul but pretends to be a living ghost, making it difficult for people to understand. This is truly mocking oneself.

However, it would be fine if they were mocking themselves, but they just happen to occupy a considerable position in this society, forcing a group of energetic young people to spend a lot of energy trying to figure out those ghostly figures and even following them to create that ghostly sound. That is truly a lot of sin!

In order to save the energy of some cultural youths, to prevent them from wasting it on unnecessary paths, and to use it for deeper achievements, and at the same time, to allow the masses who do not have much money to learn the ancient tunes and tones to also be able to seek knowledge and express emotions; I want to ask the adults and gentlemen to eliminate the legacy of classical Chinese and expand the modern Chinese movement;

(1) The entrance exams for universities and middle schools should all be limited to writing in modern Chinese: that is, to use modern language to write modern views. Some Chinese language teachers in universities or high schools fully copy old antiques from the Four Books and Five Classics, and even the graders only look at classical Chinese test papers and not colloquial test papers. Such a habit of forcing young students to drive backwards must be eradicated!

(2) All official documents, whether reports, consultations, orders, approvals, especially government notices, orders, etc., should abolish all kinds of official stereotypes and use colloquial language.

(3) All applied writing in society, whether letters, contracts, advertisements, invitations, etc., should abolish all kinds of inherited conventions and completely use colloquial language.

(4) News and articles in newspapers and magazines should be written in colloquial language as a way to promote and popularize it.

Some people say that writing in classical Chinese is economical. In fact, this is not necessarily the case. For example, there is a telegram that says: "...this place believes that the hope for a peaceful resolution of the Tianjin incident is very slim..." If it is rewritten in colloquial language, it can be written as: "Here, it is believed that the hope of peacefully resolving the Tianjin incident is very small." Can't one word be saved? Many old antiques that groan without illness or are full of clichés, watching them shake their heads and wag their tails, cannot say a single reason, that is extremely uneconomical! Therefore, whether writing is economical depends on whether its content is substantial and whether speaking is verbose. Moreover, writing in colloquial language can save the author the effort of learning to read ancient Chinese and the effort of translating classical Chinese into colloquial language when reading. Isn't that much more economical than writing in classical Chinese?

The "Literary Revolution" and "Revolutionary Literature" have been advocated for more than 20 years, but there are still many young students who want to read classical Chinese and learn classical Chinese; and our country's education has not yet been truly popularized; this is entirely because the new antique - classical Chinese - is at work in society. Therefore, education directors, government officials, and leaders from all walks of life should issue decrees or advocate modern Chinese as soon as possible. So that those new antiques lose their basis in society, then modern Chinese that conforms to the spirit of the times will naturally rise and become popular, and the "Literary Revolution" and "Revolutionary Literature" will naturally achieve further victories.

Although the above is a rehash of old ideas, it is still worth shouting loudly. I hope everyone "knows and acts", and gets down to business in a practical way.

### The Armed Forces of the People

— Sheng Dan

...War Zone Diary...

From Shangcheng to Anhui, there are two roads to take: one from Yuzidian to Huishan Mountain, passing through Siduohe for twenty li, which is the territory of Anhui. This is a relatively flat main road; the other is from Siguadun to Suxianshi, crossing Huangtu Ridge to reach Zaoxuehe. This is the shortest shortcut, but the road is winding and the mountain slopes are steep, making it impossible to travel without walking. We arrived in Shangcheng from Songbu at around 9 p.m. Although we had a truck from the military supervision department as transportation, we still had to get out of the car and wade through the vast stone beaches where mountain water converged. Otherwise, if the wheels played tricks on the rocks, you would definitely have to hold a "water ceremony."

That night, we stayed at the Dahua Hotel next to the county government. It was considered the leading hotel in Shangcheng, with paper windows, uneven dirt floors, and dilapidated bamboo beds, all of which preserved the style of the Middle Ages. However, the inferiority of material conditions can reflect the simplicity of social life. The perseverance of the people of Central Plains can be seen here. Moreover, the people are tough. Since this organization, training, and the infusion of political common sense, they are all eager to defend their homeland, preparing to shed their blood.

Mr. Zhang Naiqi of the Anhui Provincial Committee also stayed in Shangcheng that day. This well-known national fighter was returning to Anhui from Wuhan, passing through here, so we met. He wore a set of worn gray cloth uniforms and paced back and forth in the yard. No one knew that he was a high-ranking official.

"Ah, where are you going?" He seemed a little surprised.

"Anhui," I replied, "Going to western Anhui." I immediately added.

"Then let's travel together?"

"No, we may want to go to Xinyang for investigation."

Then, he told us about the mobilization work of the people here, expressing great satisfaction and excitement. He said that the 150-li mountain road into Anhui could only be traversed on foot, because western Anhui was short of both salt and rice, and it was necessary to move the people to prepare for a rainy day, so hiring a sedan chair was absolutely impossible.

Somehow, County Magistrate Chen Shouchang actually discovered Mr. Zhang's arrival and came to Dahua early the next morning to invite him to give a speech. We were also invited along. After the speech, we toured the entire city. This ancient county town on the Henan border is less than ten li in circumference. Because it is located in the war zone, the streets appear very quiet, but the people's emotions towards the war of resistance are extremely tense, which can certainly be proven by the impression gained from the lecture meeting. It is said that the six counties formerly under the jurisdiction of Guangzhou, Henan, have been plagued by bandits for years, and the people's defense work has always been done very well. The baojia system is also quite complete. Once the mobile war begins, the people's armed forces of Shangcheng will immediately come into play to undertake the defense of western Anhui, which is more than enough. To prove this, Shangcheng has been occupied for half a year. However, the iron cavalry has never crossed the Zaoxuehe River a step. Although relying on natural barriers, it also relies on human power. Who says political work is not important?

### On the Banks of the Don River

— Zeng Zhaojun

The Don River flows quietly southward, and the half-full moon stretches its face to look at the water. The dark green ripples slowly oscillate, as if trying to carry the moonlit color on the water away.

The two banks under the starry sky are as desolate as if they were asleep, and the sound of fallen flowers touching the water surface can be heard clearly.

But when a light yellow speedboat speeds along the river with a "rumble, rumble," the surrounding silence is broken. Standing and sitting in the boat are about forty people, wearing white uniforms and large collars edged with blue.

"This is damn Xi Wu water, both iron and fishy! I'm dying of thirst!" one said. "Alas! Thirst is not a big deal. Hunger is even more unbearable! Look, along the river, it is full of smoke, desolate and indifferent! People have all run away, where can you find something to eat? Alas! Alas! I'm going to starve to death!" another said.

"Brothers, don't quarrel!" One, who seemed to be a captain, stood up and pointed his left hand to the east, "The village over there seems to have people, let's go there and try our luck."

When the hull of the speedboat touched the shore, more than forty strong men rushed ashore like a flock of white geese being driven. Almost the entire village was walked through, and all that was in front of them was broken tiles and rubble and vague flesh and blood. Nothing else could be seen.

A group of disappointed people walked very slowly, sighing and complaining to each other. Suddenly, from behind several charred ancient pines in the county, came a subtle, miserable sob.

"Everyone listen, isn't this the sound of a woman crying?" the captain said, standing still. He ran with the sound, taking three steps in two. Sure enough, his guess was correct. Behind the pine trees was a woman with disheveled hair and a haggard face. She was sitting cross-legged on a large pile of dry straw, holding a small baby in her arms.

"Hey, are you a spy! What are you doing sitting here alone?" the captain asked in a fierce voice.

"Ah! Gods and Bodhisattvas!" The woman showed a flustered expression, "I... I am not a spy! I am a refugee who has run from afar. I beg you not to be so loud, I'm afraid it will frighten my child!"

"What are you sitting on? Get out of the way and let me check!"

"My cheeks are very sour, can't you just not check?"

"What are you talking about! Get out of the way!"

The woman hugged the child and stood up with trembling legs. She fell down again! The captain couldn't wait any longer, jumped up and pushed her away with a palm, and then several people walked up and turned over the straw. What was covered? It turned out to be two roasted pig legs; a jar of clear old wine.

The captain smiled and winked at the woman: "Good, I didn't expect you, woman, to be our savior. However, these things--" He bent over and teased the pig legs, "Are they reliable?"

"Hahaha!" The woman suddenly laughed, "You suspect that these things have been poisoned? Anyway, you have already seen them, so I don't need to hide it. These things were all brought from my husband's hometown, prepared to honor my mother's family. I didn't expect to come here, but what greeted me was a changed homeland, parents!" She cried again.

"Captain!" A noisy shout, "What are you talking nonsense with her for, quickly divide the things and eat them! We are all starving to death!"

"Don't be noisy!" The captain turned his head and swept a majestic gaze at the soldiers, then turned to the woman and said, "Sister-in-law, since that's the case, it's cheaper for us, but it's not good for us to eat yours for nothing!" - "He untied the white scoop from his waist and poured a scoop of old wine to the brim, "Let me first offer you a cup."

"Good, good, good, the official's heart is good." She took the wine and drank it all.

"Hey! Captain! She has eaten it herself! Can't we eat it?" It was another burst of greedy cries.

"Don't make trouble!" The captain ordered a second time. He poured half a scoop of wine for the woman again, "Let this little child have a little too. His face doesn't look good, and eating it will make him look ruddy."

The woman took the wine, hesitated slightly, and sent it to the child inside. Everyone didn't notice that her hand was constantly shaking.

After the child finished the wine, the soldiers came up to pick up things to eat without waiting for the captain's order. The captain was also relieved this time, tearing the pig's leg and stuffing it into his mouth. Just as he was devouring it, the woman's crying came again.

"Why has your child turned blue? Ah! Is he dead?" the captain jumped up and asked.

"Yes, he is dead! He died for the country and the nation!" The woman said with passion, "The lives of our mother and child have been exchanged for the lives of more than forty enemies, this is... this is... worth it!" She couldn't support herself a bit. She said with her last breath, "Listen, you murderers of mankind! We will meet in the underworld, and we will always be 'enemies'!"

### Slacking Off

— Jia Jie

Friend, I often hear people say: "No retreat, no rest." Especially since you have already embarked on the path of truth.

Loneliness and depression tightly surround us, almost suffocating us to death. We live a prison-like life, shouting and complaining as much as we can, but who will pity us and release us?

At least we have never covered our faces and wept, and we have never grasped the approach of death: we are wholeheartedly looking for a way out.

Although not as good as the release of a wild beast, it can be regarded as a fledgling bird spreading its wings, allowing the free sky to fly. The road has been found, we have already begun to embark on it, and nothing will be difficult to achieve.

The process may be bitter, but this is a new advent. I believe there are countless things that can encourage and excite us. Friend, you seem to have thought of this too!

I don't understand why you have to look back again and again, what is worth clinging to in a prison-like life? A happy material and comfortable enjoyment, friend, that is poison!

You are hesitating again, although you do not admit that this is a retreat or a rest, but you are slacking off, and your spirit will be decadent. There is no way to recover.

People who live a comfortable life as slaves forever are waving to you. I understand that they have seduced you, but we have shouted and complained, have you forgotten that?

Your will may be at war, or you may have decided to turn back, your actions have been so slack. Friend, please recognize it for a moment!

Since we have embarked on the path of truth, how can we bear to separate halfway, let us join hands and move forward!

### Charging Towards the Motherland

— Jin Yi

—Still a Story of a Girl—

Qingzhi deliberately pointed out the people outside to let Jingwen hear, she looked! Outside, Sui leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes again. Suddenly she opened her eyes wide and asked:

"When can we get to Guangzhou?"

"We should get there today."

Qingzhi answered intentionally or unintentionally. Thinking of Guangzhou, it gave her infinitely rich fantasies. She remembered how many years ago, young people went to Guangzhou just like going to northern Shaanxi now. Although the storms of many years have damaged its original nature, that place still has many stubborn and bloody people that she knows well.

The car kept rushing, finally roaring loudly like a victory, and the speed gradually slowed down. The train passed the fork in the road, shaking and angrily breaking into the platform. (To be continued)

The election of the 14th new staff members of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce was sealed in the ballot box at 5 pm yesterday, and voting was closed. When the box was sealed, the election supervisors Zhao Yin Sun, Zhou Jinchi, Liu Jingqing, Chen Zhongchi, Xing Yuming, Feng Qizhuo Cao Fuzhao, Du Zewen, Li Zhuoquan, and Ma Boyong were all present. At 5 o'clock, the seals signed by the ballot supervisors were sealed on the ballot box by the servants, and it was decided that the ballot box would be opened and the ballots counted by the election supervisors at the library on the fourth floor of the Chamber of Commerce at 10 am today. It was originally scheduled to handle the ballot counting for two days today and tomorrow, but because there were not many ballots in this election, the election supervisors estimated that the ballot counting could be completed today and the new directors would be announced. The election this time was not as enthusiastic as the last one. In the last election, 982 ballots were issued, and only 704 were issued this time, and the voting was also very scattered. Those who will be announced today are 100 new directors, and the chairman and treasurer will be re-elected by these 100 new directors.

### The Number of Cholera Cases in Hong Kong Has Reached 258, The Disease is Also Spreading Widely in Guangzhou

In the thirteen days up to last Sunday, there were 19 cases of cholera, 11 cases of typhoid fever, 6 cases of measles, 2 cases of meningitis, 8 cases of dysentery, and 72 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in Hong Kong. The number of cholera cases this year has now reached 258. At the same time, the cholera epidemic in Guangzhou is also extremely widespread. According to the "puppet authorities," 70 people died from this disease in June, and there are still many unreported cases. It is believed that the actual number is definitely not this number. The × side has now forced residents to be vaccinated. It is claimed that from May 14 to June 15, about 349,070 people were vaccinated in one month. If this statement is true, then the shortage of the population of Guangzhou can be imagined. The cholera epidemic in Jiujiang City is also spreading gradually. On October 24, the × party sent military districts to the countryside to be responsible for vaccination. Those villagers who were unwilling to be vaccinated were driven to Heshan and were not allowed to return to Jiujiang.

### Nathan Road, Thousand Yuan Huge Theft, Ye Shun Directly Admits to Theft, Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment

### The Robbery Case on Li Yuen Street East Was Formally Indicted Yesterday, Continued Trial at 2:30 PM Today

On October 5th, Zhang Da of Zhongde Bank went to the Overseas Chinese Bank to withdraw 500 yuan in soft currency. When he returned through Li Yuen Street East in Central, he was attacked by two bandits. At that time, two Chinese detectives, Song Jingwen, passed by and immediately arrested the bandits. Unexpectedly, the bandits pulled out their pistols and fired at Yin Wen. Tan Song saw the situation and immediately chased the bandits desperately. As a result, the bandit who committed the crime was shot dead by Tan on the way. Several passers-by were injured by stray bullets. Chinese detective Yin Wen also died of his injuries in the hospital on the 11th of last month. Wen Zhu, one of the robbers who was arrested on the spot, was immediately charged with the case and has been tried by the Central Patrol Court. At 2:30 pm yesterday, the case was formally indicted by the Justice. The British helper He Jian was in charge of the prosecution and charged with the crimes of (1) conspiring with the deceased Lin Ya Fang to beat Zhang Da and attempt to rob, (2) privately possessing a pistol and five bullets without a license. The trial situation is recorded below. After the court session began, the British helper He Jian stated the cause of the case and presented many photos taken at the scene of the incident that day as evidence. Then, the government photographer and photographer testified one after another on the location where the pictures were taken and what they saw on the day.

Then, Zhang Da, the victim of the robbery that day, recounted the robbery in detail, saying, "On the morning of the 5th of last month, after I withdrew money from the Overseas Chinese Bank and left, I walked towards this place. I walked on the left side of the sidewalk and turned into Li Yuen Street East. Suddenly, a bandit put his arm around my neck from behind. I immediately felt a sharp pain and struggled desperately, but another bandit sprinkled chili powder on my eyes and forcibly opened my western-style coat to rob me from my arms. But I firmly held the front collar of the bandit, and he wanted to break free from me, so I shouted for help. Later, I heard gunshots, and the bandit tried his best to break free and left. The tie was torn off by me in my hand (blue), the tie was presented in court), and ran towards Dama Road. I then followed him, but because my eyes were blinded by the chili powder, I could barely support myself and could not chase him. I turned into Zhonghua Pharmacy at 82 Avenue Central and asked pharmacist Chen Wenzhu to wash my eyes." Next, Chen Wenzhu, the pharmacist of Zhonghua Pharmacy, testified that Zhang Da did come to the pharmacy to request washing on the day, and what he suffered in his eyes was indeed chili powder. After that, a child (16 years old) who set up a stall on Li Yuen Street East testified that on the morning of that day, he saw two men, one wearing a Chinese eye and one wearing a Western suit, acting like a robbery on a young man wearing a Western suit, and saw that the young man's face and eyes were covered with white powder. Afterwards, he saw a gunshot and fell to the ground. Then, the two men fled along the tram road. Shortly afterwards, there were three more gunshots, and he didn't know what happened afterwards. After the official listened to all the testimonies, he ordered that the case be adjourned until 2:30 pm today for continued trial.

### Various Social Organizations Commemorate "July 7th", The Tour Guide Association Promotes "Charity Guidance", Soldiers Shed Blood on the Battlefield, Risking Their Lives, How Can the People Bear to Live in a Drunken Dream at This Moment?

Recently, various tour guide associations have made a special tour guide campaign for the upcoming "July 7th," and one singing leads to a hundred responses, like tea and fire, which is not enough to indicate the solemn and sacred concept of the second anniversary of the War of Resistance. According to the investigation, the general red tour guide girls have been recruiting their "acquaintances" for support, hoping to obtain the most "charity guide" income on that day and win the "charity guide" championship "honor." At the same time, the general group of people who live in a drunken dream have also released their horses and prepared to show their courtesy under the pomegranate skirt. From their appearance, the tour guide circle, whether it is the boss, tour guide girl, or employed tour guide, has a sincerity of patriotism that makes us admire and cannot be faulted. However, if we make further exploration, we know that it is in the name of saving the country, taking pleasure in reality. Even if all the proceeds are allocated to the authorities, the country's financial gains are limited, but the spiritual decline of the people fundamentally affects the strength of the war of resistance. The actual loss suffered by the country is beyond words. Moreover, what is decided to be allocated is only a part of the "charity guide" income. How can this be compared to the soldiers and compatriots who shed blood in front and die for the country? At this time when the survival of the nation is at stake, is it different from this kind of "charity guide" that leads people to prostitution and depravity? In addition to serving the country, is there no other way? The country's steps are dangerous, and overseas compatriots live in ease and joy, and should all know what to fight. In this solemn and sacred anniversary of the second anniversary of the war of resistance, we can encourage each other to increase the country's strength in the war of resistance, and we must not abandon ourselves and shame the nation. Hong Kong is a mixed place for Chinese and foreigners, and it is a place where international attention is focused. Every advance and retreat should be based on the country as a prerequisite. If there is only personal interest in mind, it is even better to claim to serve the country to gain the sympathy of the society and achieve its base profit goals, then no matter how subtle and sensational the propaganda methods are, Hong Kong overseas Chinese who respect themselves should not distinguish between black and white and not let their selfish plans succeed. In this way, on the one hand, it will benefit people's hearts, and on the other hand, it will also increase the strength of the war of resistance. If it is necessary to give "charity guide" assistance so that the country can get more income, it will not only be useless but also cause the country to suffer. It is hoped that the central government's resident guidance commissioner in Hong Kong will pay attention to it.

International Friends Raise Funds for Us, Coolies Thoroughly for the Country, The Tide of National Salvation is in Singapore

### Mr. Cheng Boyong's Urgent Trip Back to Chaozhou to Provide Relief - A Conversation Upon Arrival in Hong Kong

— Qi Zhuo

Special Report from This Newspaper: Three Ambulances Donated

Mr. W. Rasathury, an Indian national, is a rare international friend who fully sympathizes with our country's resistance against Japan. In his forties, he is a robust man. He works as a civil servant in the Kuala Lumpur government, responsible for issuing rubber licenses. He has extensive social connections and close ties with our overseas Chinese compatriots. He possesses a high degree of awareness and deeply understands that China's war of resistance is for the sake of global justice and righteousness, and that ultimate victory will inevitably come. Therefore, he utilized his position and social talents to painstakingly raise over ten thousand Singapore dollars, which he has already used to purchase three ambulances, fully stocked with medicine, and handed over to the Singapore Relief Association. These will soon be transported to China for emergency aid. This act has moved many Chinese and Western individuals. How can those Chinese who have money but do not donate have the face to meet this transnational international friend? We should thank this passionate friend with a sense of justice and offer him our great and lofty respect.

Sixty-Odd Dollars for a Bowl of Noodles

In a bustling charity bazaar in Singapore, miracles that move people to tears happen constantly.

There was a coolie, drenched in sweat. His short clothes, thick calves, and robust physique were all signs of hard work and poverty. However, he possessed a spiritual core and a strong sense of national identity. He was an outstanding descendant of the Chinese nation. He quietly rummaged through his waistband and finally took out sixty-odd Singapore dollars, tightly bound together. He bought a bowl of charity noodles and ate it with great satisfaction. This bowl of noodles represented the price of his entire fortune, earned with countless drops of blood and sweat, and saved over a long period. However, for the great glory of his motherland and to break the shackles on his body, he did not hesitate to do so. This is just one example. Who are the main forces of our national revolution? Here, we can find a concrete answer.

The Story of the Ears

The boycott of enemy goods is genuinely and strictly enforced in Singapore. Organizations have their own discipline, and various trades have their own investigation methods. Anyone who buys and sells enemy goods against their conscience will be severely punished. Enemy goods are virtually nonexistent in Singapore. The anti-Japanese sentiment is, needless to say, very intense. Recently, Wang Jingwei's henchmen have begun to be active there, spreading the poison of "peace." Overseas Chinese organizations are already on high alert. If anyone is found to violate the central government's national policy or the leader's pronouncements, they will be unceremoniously deported.

× Elements Go to Extremes in Inciting Discord

Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are becoming increasingly enthusiastic about saving their country. The only drawback is that factional strife has not been overcome. Many frictions, disputes, misunderstandings, and losses arise from this. It seems that the division between the two factions of, for example, prominent overseas Chinese figures so-and-so and so-and-so, is still very deep. Fortunately, one of the leaders of these two factions has obtained conclusive evidence and suddenly realized that it was × people who were inciting discord and fueling the flames. Abandoning past grievances, reaching an understanding, and strengthening unity have become very likely trends. We will see if × people's endless conspiracies and attempts to infiltrate everywhere will end in failure.

Mr. Cheng Boyong Rushes Back to Chaozhou to Develop Relief Work

The above is what Mr. Cheng Boyong told reporters yesterday in Hong Kong after rushing back to Chaozhou from Singapore. Mr. Cheng is the president of the Chaozhou Red Cross. Since the outbreak of the war, he has been enthusiastically training relief personnel. He currently also serves as the captain of the Chaozhou Red Cross rescue team and the captain of the Chao'an District Air Defense Command's rescue brigade. To develop relief work, Mr. Cheng went to Southeast Asia two months ago to raise funds. He has now raised over ten thousand national dollars. In Singapore, upon hearing the news of the Chaozhou-Shantou Incident, Mr. Cheng, feeling responsible, immediately set off for Chaozhou to lead over two thousand trained rescuers in carrying out widespread relief work. Mr. Cheng arrived in Hong Kong yesterday and plans to detour to a certain place where the Chao'an military and political authorities have retreated to, in order to facilitate planning. Mr. Cheng witnessed the enthusiastic fundraising efforts of the Chaozhou overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia to provide relief to their hometowns. Yesterday, upon arriving in Hong Kong, he also saw many young people from Chaozhou requesting to return to their hometowns with him to serve. Moved by this, Mr. Cheng will certainly return to Chaozhou and Shantou to encourage his compatriots to work together in the same boat, with one heart and one mind, to share the difficulties and create a new life together.

### Colonial Secretary Smith Returns to England on Leave - General Norsworthy and Major-General Jenour Travel to Yuguan by Land and Sea

Colonial Secretary Smith, who has served in Hong Kong for a long time, has recently requested leave to return to England. He will be accompanied by his wife and daughter, a total of two people.

### The Tung Wah Hospital Board of Directors is in a Difficult Situation - No One is Willing to Take Office Due to the Poor Economic Environment

The handover between the old and new directors of Tung Wah Hospital is usually scheduled to take place in the first month of the lunar calendar. However, in recent years, due to the poor economic environment, no one has been willing to take office as a director of the hospital.

Although the former directors of the hospital have made many efforts to solicit candidates, more than five months have passed, and the number of directors is still not sufficient. So far, only five people have been secured: Zhang Zihang, Yang Yongkang, Chen Bosun, Han Runlin, and Yu Xisheng. Mr. Yu is the most recent addition. As for Mr. Deng Zhiqing, although he initially agreed to take office, he recently withdrew his agreement. Therefore, there are still only five people, more than half the original target of eleven. The handover date remains indefinitely postponed.

### Telephone Company Adds Underground Cables in the Central District to Meet Demand - The Number of Telephones in Hong Kong Currently Exceeds 20,000 - Electric Company Expands its Power Plant to Supply Electricity

Since the outbreak of the war, the population of Hong Kong has increased, and the number of telephone users has also increased accordingly. As of today, the number of telephones has increased to over 20,000, whereas five years ago, it was only 11,000. The area with the largest increase in telephones is the Central District. All the newly installed underground cables were exhausted two months ago. To meet the demand of residents, the company has completed the installation of a new cable. However, many new telephones installed in the Central District cannot be connected due to the lack of underground cable connections. The electricity supply problem has also been affected. The main power plant of the Electric Company on the sixth floor of the Exchange Building has recently experienced a supply shortage due to the increase in telephone users, especially on Saturdays and Sundays. The electricity supply is insufficient, and outages occur frequently. Therefore, a new generator unit has been added to the power plant, which is expected to be completed by the end of the month.

### The Construction Department Concentrates Talent - Develops Inland Industry - Implements Industrial Revitalization to Promote Production in the Rear Areas

(Shaoguan Express) Zhu Hui, Director of the Department of Construction, recently inspected the Eastern Road Provincial Highway with Chen Song, Director of the Highway Administration. He returned to Shaoguan at the end of June. On the 30th, he told reporters about his inspection and the various construction matters under consideration:

Organizing Transportation

He said that during this inspection, he made detailed inspections of the counties and cities along the Chao-Shao Highway, such as Wengyuan, Lianping, Heyuan, Longchuan, Xingning, Wuhua, Fengshun, and Jieyang. He intended to formulate methods for reorganizing transportation. However, after the × invasion of Chaozhou and Shantou, circumstances changed, and each section was destroyed to adapt to the current needs. In the future, the direction of reorganization of the Eastern Road must take into account the environment before a decision can be made.

Supporting Agriculture

Secondly, with regard to production, the focus is on supporting rural areas. To improve farming and increase agricultural production, the most important thing is to rotate rural finance. It is initially planned that the Department will provide farmers' loans. This matter has now been ordered to be handled by the Finance Department. As for rural cooperatives, they will be jointly operated by the Department and the Central Agricultural Credit Administration. The plan is being drafted to ensure that the province's agriculture is properly developed during the war.

Developing Industry

The development of inland light industry was in principle decided earlier by the National Production Conference. The province is currently considering it. The issue of iron and various raw materials will soon be specifically resolved. The Industrial Management Office of the Department has telegraphed the directors and technicians of the provincial factories to come to Shaoguan to clean up past factory affairs and concentrate people in villages as a basis for industrial development. At the same time, matters related to the relief of righteous people will be carried out to implement industrial revitalization, promote production in the rear areas, and achieve multiple benefits in one fell swoop. The Department will do its best.

[Shaoguan Air News] Since May 29th, when × planes heavily bombed Shaoguan, resulting in over a hundred casualties and extensive damage to buildings, there had been a relatively peaceful period for over ten days.

### Wimbledon Tennis Singles Quarterfinals Today: Austin Loses in Straight Sets to Cochet; All Eight Remaining Women are Seeded Players

The Wimbledon Tennis Championships, after a day of rest, continued on Monday in pleasant weather. The players, having rested and recuperated, showed greater enthusiasm, and the competition entered a critical stage. However, by the end of the competition, the situation differed significantly from what was predicted. In particular, Austin's elimination and loss of his quarterfinal qualification were completely unexpected. A summary of the situation is as follows:

### Austin: Past His Prime, Loses to Cochet

Yesterday was the Men's Singles Quarterfinals, and the already devalued Austin experienced a tragedy in this match. Austin's opponent was Cochet (USA), who was unceremonious and eliminated the last remaining British player in the Men's Singles in straight sets. The result was 6-3, 6-0, 6-1, further demonstrating the ease of Cochet's victory and the defeat of Austin.

The entire match lasted only three quarters of an hour, and Austin seemed to have lost his former brilliance. Although he occasionally displayed brilliant performances with angled shots, his overall technique felt like he was "past his prime."

### Three Newcomers All Eliminated

Another unexpected "easy victory" was Pansegrouw (South Africa)'s defeat of Smith (USA). Smith had defeated many famous players in previous matches, but yesterday's loss was his Waterloo in Wimbledon. He was eliminated by the South African hero with a score of 6-0, 6-2, 6-2.

The other two matches were Riggs (USA) against Muhammad (India) and Henkel (Germany) against Cocarjevic (South Africa). Riggs is currently one of the favorites for the title, and Muhammad's experience is far below Riggs', so his defeat was expected. The result of the match was 6-2, 6-2, 6-2.

Henkel (Germany)'s match against Cocarjevic (South Africa) was won by Henkel, but detailed results have not been telegraphed. It is assumed that it was more dramatic than the other three matches.

### Last Four Players in Quarterfinals Today

The semifinals were completely concluded yesterday. The four players remaining in the quarterfinals from the one hundred and twenty who participated at the start are Riggs, Pansegrouw, Henkel, and Cochet. Today, in the quarterfinals, Pansegrouw will face Riggs, and Henkel will face Cochet. The quarterfinals are the second best event in the entire competition. With evenly matched opponents, there should be dramatic matches. If there are no surprises, the finalists will likely be Riggs and Henkel.

### Few Surprises in Women's Singles

In the Women's Singles, the seeded players achieved complete victory, and the British players suffered the same fate as Austin. The results of the matches are as follows:

Mrs. Fabyan (USA) defeated Mrs. Lycett (England) 6-1, 3-6, 6-2.  Miss Jędrzejowska (Poland) defeated Miss Scriven (England) 6-1, 6-3.

Mrs. Mathieu (France) defeated Miss St. Quintin (England) 6-3, 4-6, 6-2.

Miss Jacobs (USA) defeated Miss Lumb (England) 6-2, 7-5.

Miss Hardwick (England) defeated Miss McFerran (England) 6-4, 8-6.

Miss Stammers (England) defeated Mrs. Henrotin (France) 7-5, 6-2.

Miss Marble (USA) defeated Mrs. Halff (France) 6-1, 6-1.

Mrs. Sperling (Denmark) defeated Mrs. Sandison (England) 6-2, 6-2.

All Eight Remaining Women are Seeded Players

The eight women players, as expected, entered the "Final Eight." In the semifinals, the four matchups are: Miss Jacobs vs. Miss Stammers, Mrs. Mathieu vs. Mrs. Fabyan, Miss Hardwick vs. Mrs. Sperling, and Miss Jędrzejowska vs. Miss Marble.

### Brief News

The Guanyun Small Football Team, possessing skilled football players such as Liu Tianshen, Qian Chifen, Luo Yongju, Liang Bowen, etc., has formidable strength. Yesterday, they played a friendly match against the A.Q. team at the Mong Kok Stadium. The A.Q. team consists of elite Shanghai players, and their football skills are not weak. The referee was Lei Shaoming. After the two teams started competing in Mong Kok, they competed fiercely. In the end, Guanyun won with a score of 2-1. It is also heard that the A.Q. team recently opened their own stadium on a wasteland on To Kwa Wan Road. The team, demonstrating the spirit of never fearing defeat, is eager for strong teams from the south to arrange matches. The contact address is Hong Kong Factory, Chung Hwa Book Company, Kowloon.

The Dequan Cup, organized by the Hong Kong Branch of the China National Small Football Association (i.e., the Hong Kong Small Football Advancement Association), has a total of 46 participating teams this year. The draw for allocating teams to each group was held a few days ago, dividing them into four groups: Luo, De, Quan, and Ding. The competition date has been set to begin at 3:00 PM on the 9th of this month.

### Southern Tour Diary

— Chen Dehui

October 6th

According to the competition schedule, our team should be playing against the Southern Guangdong Second Team today. It is said that the Saigon Football Association held a meeting last night to discuss and determine a new formation, which shows its seriousness. In order to cope with strong opponents, our team has also carefully considered the selection of players. After the Southern Guangdong Second Team, we still have to face the most elite Southern Guangdong First Team in Saigon. The player selection for today is as follows:

Bao Jiaping, Li Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng, Liang Rongzhao, Liu Qingcai, Song Lingsheng, Yang Shuiyi, Li Zhaorong, Chen Deji (down), Yang Genbao (up), Feng Jingxiang, Deng Guangsen

After lunch, we had a full rest. When the time for the match arrived, we put on our uniforms and set off. Before departing, Mr. Liu Zeng and Zhu Zhonghao visited and talked about the opponent's strategy. According to them, the opposing team plans to use the Corinthian style of play, with two full-backs guarding the opponent's two wings, the half-backs guarding the opponent's two inside forwards, and the centre half-back acting as the third line of defense. This strategy will make it difficult for the opponent to advance, and victory will not be easy. Upon arriving at the stadium, the crowds had already gathered, almost blocking all paths. Although tickets had already sold out, there were still many people hoping to get in. At 4:30 PM, the witness gathered the captains of both teams for a formal exchange. Our Captain Bao even presented the other team with a team flag as a memento. After the ceremony, the competition began. Our centre forward Comrade Genbao played very hard, but he was nervous and his passing was often inaccurate. Moreover, the opponent's morale was high, and the first half ended in a 0-0 draw. In the second half, I received the team manager's order to replace Genbao. Although I felt tired playing, Jingxiang and Zhaorong were very active. Unfortunately, the opponent was overly aggressive, which detracted from the purpose of friendly exchange. I, Jingxiang, and Zhaorong were injured one after another, and Comrades Feng and Li suffered even more injuries. Although we finally won 3-2, the strength for tomorrow's battle was greatly reduced. The key contributors to this match were Jingxiang, who scored two goals, and Zhaorong, who added the finishing touch with one goal, totaling three goals.

After returning to the base camp, we immediately called for a doctor to treat the injured. Comrade Zhaorong had injured his foot in Hong Kong before, and it had not healed. Now, he was injured again. Even if he could play tomorrow, he would definitely not be at his best. Due to the fierce battle during the day, the soldiers were all exhausted and went to sleep early that night.

June 11th

This morning, Comrade Zhaorong felt severe pain in his foot, and his mobility was greatly reduced. Team Manager Mo, Zhou Qian, and others discussed the formation for today, all with furrowed brows. It is true that our team does not have many soldiers, and those with rich experience are seriously injured. In this condition of injury and disability, it is impossible to win against a strong enemy. We knew this early on. However, in order to preserve a city, we will not be discouraged. The lineup for today is as follows:

Bao Jiaping, Li Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng, Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Guo Yingqi, Yang Shuiyi, Li Zhaorong, Chen Dehui, Feng Jingxiang, Deng Guangsen

Today's crowd was unprecedented. Nearly 6,000 people could not get in. After 4:00 PM, there was heavy rain. We fought in the rain because the schedule was fixed. The opponent was strong and vigorous, and they indeed used the Corinthian style, with the centre half-back acting as the third line of defense. Their attack and defense were well-organized, and they had made significant progress compared to the past. On the other hand, our three inside forwards were injured, and the ground was slippery due to the rain, so defeat was inevitable. The score of 5-3 should not be considered our fault.

After the match, the Saigon Football Association invited us to a tea party, and we dispersed joyfully late at night.
