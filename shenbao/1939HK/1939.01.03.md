### Enhancing Political Work in the Army During the War of Resistance

Our War of Resistance Against Japan has transitioned from the first stage to the second. To launch a full-scale war and strive for ultimate victory, strengthening political work in the army is currently the most crucial matter. At present, the central authorities, in addition to restoring political organizations in the army in imitation of the Northern Expedition era, are also training a large number of political workers for deployment. In Guangdong, there is a so-called Political Work Brigade, mobilizing the people to engage in the war of resistance. In Guangxi, male and female young students are also organized to go to various guerrilla areas, following the army and undertaking political work. Elsewhere, such as in Sichuan, Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and various guerrilla areas, efforts are underway to actively promote this. These measures are the driving force for enhancing the army's combat effectiveness and a shortcut to achieving victory.

To accomplish the first task, it is essential to ensure that all officers and soldiers understand the significance and future of this war, recognizing that it is a necessary path in the process of national revolution, a war for survival and independence. All peace-loving countries in the world are therefore expressing sympathy and providing assistance. Judging from the current situation, there is a high degree of certainty of victory in the future. Secondly, it is necessary to cultivate in all officers and soldiers a spirit of perseverance, hard work, and sacrifice for the country. Thirdly, it is necessary for every soldier to consciously observe discipline, trust their commanders, resolutely execute orders, obey commands, promote the spirit of camaraderie within the unit, and consolidate internal unity.

To accomplish the second task, it is necessary to establish close ties between the army and the people. The army must not only refrain from infringing upon the interests of the people, but also, under the premise of resisting the Japanese, find ways to alleviate the suffering of the masses, unite with the people, and become the armed force of the people. At the same time, organize the people and mobilize the people. Only in this way can the closest relationship be maintained with the people.

Based on historical experience, achieving ultimate victory in war cannot rely solely on technology; the most important thing is to have correct policies and gain the support of the people. For example, during the Great Revolution of China from 1925 to 1927, the National Revolutionary Army, with relatively backward equipment, swept away the Fengtian-Zhili warlords and established a foundation for unification in a short period of time. There were many reasons for this rapid success, but one of the important reasons was the establishment of political work in the army and the support of the broad masses of the people. Now that our country is resisting Japanese aggression, in terms of equipment, it is naturally inferior to Japan, just as the National Revolutionary Army was to the armies led by the Fengtian-Zhili warlords. Therefore, to achieve ultimate victory, there is no doubt that we must rely on the power of the broad masses of the people. Not only must we mobilize the broad masses of the people militarily, but we must also mobilize the entire nation politically.

The basic tasks of political work in the army can be divided into three aspects: first, to consolidate the troops and enhance their combat effectiveness; second, to unite countless people to help and assist the army in combat; and third, to politically influence the enemy's internal affairs and disintegrate their army.

To accomplish the third task, it is necessary to awaken the political consciousness of the enemy's lower-level elements and utilize the anti-war sentiments of the enemy's army. Because the enemy's army is either forcibly conscripted from different places and different ethnic groups, or drafted from the masses of farmers and workers of their own country. They are already deeply dissatisfied with the plutocrats and warlords, and it is possible to call on them to organize and oppose the war, thereby promoting the awakening of the Japanese warlords.

In the past, our country's authorities seemed to have paid little attention to political work in the army, especially in various guerrilla areas. Although the people in the guerrilla areas have already suffered from the aggression of the Japanese warlords and are eager to rise up and resist, they not only lack political cultivation, but they are also unable to clearly understand their own environment. How can they organize and help the army in combat? If this behavior is not immediately corrected, how can it be guaranteed that some people will not only fail to see through the deception of the Japanese, but will instead support the aggressors? Fortunately, our country's authorities have now paid attention to this and have already implemented some measures. We sincerely hope that this will be earnestly implemented to achieve the above-mentioned three tasks and achieve great victory with the least sacrifice!

Transportation and Travel

### The Sino-Soviet Highway (Continued 3)

— Zhang Gongshuang

A Major Artery Connecting Sino-Soviet Direct Transportation

Commerce is very developed. Trade in minerals, livestock, and Japanese industrial products from Central Asia and European Russia, and the exchange of Chinese goods all rely on this place as a transshipment point. Now, it has become a concentration point for the Soviet Union to transport military supplies to China.

The Sino-Soviet Highway, due to the excessive length of the route and the arduousness of the project, still has many unsatisfactory aspects throughout the entire route. Except for the section belonging to the Soviet Union (the Tasha section), which is very good, other sections, such as the Xilan Road project, which cost more than one million yuan to build, are very sloppy. There are few culverts, and many places where the roadbed is not solid.

On the Gansu-Xinjiang Road, the bridges and culverts of the section from Yongdeng, Gulang, to Wuwei are not strongly built and are often in danger of being washed away by water. From Jiuquan westward to Xingxing Gorge, there are both Gobi Desert, sandy pits, and muddy beaches. Traveling on the Gobi Desert is not a problem, but sandy pits and muddy beaches often submerge the wheels, making it impossible to travel.

The government is now ordering the respective provincial governments and road bureaus to make great efforts to improve these shortcomings, some by repairing, some by rebuilding, and setting up more stations in uninhabited areas, so that this major artery in Northwest China can be actively revitalized to undertake great and arduous tasks.

Since the outbreak of the full-scale War of Resistance on "August 13" last year, transportation on this route has suddenly become busy. Sheng Shicai, the border defense commissioner of Xinjiang Province, immediately concentrated a large number of trucks, horse-drawn carts, camels, mules, etc., dedicated to transporting military supplies. He said to reporters from the East that the only help Xinjiang can give to the central government is in transportation. Therefore, I have concentrated these vehicles, camels, etc., hoping that military supplies can be delivered to the front line as soon as possible, and that is my responsibility.

After a few months of war, the government purchased new-style transport vehicles from the Soviet Union and also drove trucks from the east to participate in the transportation. Therefore, there are now enough trucks on this road to be described as endless. In total, the entire route is 4300 kilometers. It takes about 20 days for a car to travel from Semipalatinsk to Xi'an. Now, all the major stations along the route have gathered many vehicles and skilled drivers. When the truck from the previous station arrives at the next station, if the driver is tired, they will switch to an energetic driver, and if the truck is broken down, they will transfer the goods to a replacement truck at the station and then continue. This method, imitating the old "courier" system, can indeed make military supplies arrive at their destination faster. (End)

### National Government Uses British Loans to Complete Southwest Railway Network; Yunnan-Burma Railway to be Completed in Two Years; Shortening European International Transport

The National Government has long planned to develop railway transportation in the Southwest, separately completing the Baoji-Chengdu, Sichuan-Xikang, Chengdu-Chongqing, Sichuan-Guizhou, Guizhou-Guangxi, Guangdong-Guangxi, Hunan-Guizhou, Yunnan-Guizhou, Yunnan-Burma, Hunan-Guangxi, and Indo-China railways, totaling eleven major lines with a total length of 6,400 kilometers. However, due to the large scale of the projects and the large amount of funding required, they cannot be completed in a short period of time. Therefore, a Southwest Economic Construction Committee has been specially established, with Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and Zhang Qun serving as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively, to raise 20 million yuan as a fund to formulate detailed plans and strive to complete them gradually within the realm of possibility.

Borrowing Successfully, Actively Building

Since Britain agreed to provide a credit loan of 10 million pounds, designated for the purchase of railway and other materials, the government authorities decided to first build the Yunnan-Burma Railway, which connects Guizhou and Yunnan provinces to Burma. The route progresses westward from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, passing through Guangtong, Anning, Chuxiong, Mibo, Dali, Baoshan, Tengchong, and other places to Manyun Town on the Sino-Burmese border, and then from Manyun to Bhamo in Burma. The entire line is approximately 1,200 kilometers long and is expected to be completed within two years.

Opening Up European International Transport

The construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway is of great significance for opening up European international transportation. Because the terminus of the road, Bhamo, already has a railway connecting it to Rangoon, a seaport in Burma, after the completion of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, the two railways can be connected in Bhamo, then the sea journey between western China and Europe can be greatly shortened, without having to go around the Malay Peninsula, but can land directly in Rangoon and take a train directly to Kunming, saving at least a week of sea travel. At present, the Yunnan-Burma Highway has been completed and opened to traffic, making it even more convenient for the transportation of construction materials.

Surveys of Guizhou-Yunnan and Other Roads Completed

The Yunnan-Guizhou Railway from Guiyang to Kunming is approximately 750 kilometers long and requires a construction cost of 60 million yuan, and the Sichuan-Yunnan Railway from Xufu in Sichuan to Kunming has also been surveyed. Construction will begin soon. There is also the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway under construction, which is financed by a loan of 34.5 million yuan from the French bank group and 20 million yuan raised by the government and domestic financial circles. The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company is responsible for the actual construction and is scheduled to be completed in the summer of next year.

### Procedures for Chinese to Obtain Passports in Hong Kong

Merchants Pay Six Dollars, Workers and Students Four Dollars; Must Be Guaranteed by Gentry, Merchants, or Firms to be Issued

Since the military situation, people who go abroad all transit through Hong Kong. Since the fall of Guangzhou, the passport department established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been established in Hong Kong as the Hong Kong Visa Commissioner's Office, which officially issued visas from December 12th of last year. The processing procedures are detailed below.

Establishment Process

Since the fall of Guangzhou, it has been extremely difficult for people to obtain passports to go abroad to make a living. In order to take care of the people's livelihood and facilitate Chinese people to go abroad to do business, the government specially sent a document to the British government for consultation, and temporarily established a passport issuance office in Hong Kong (now located at No. 6, 5th Floor, Des Voeux Road Central, Hong Kong), appointing a commissioner. The British side agreed, and it was originally scheduled to start issuing visas on December 1st of last year, but due to preparation procedures, it was later changed to officially issuing visas on December 12th.

Passport Procedures

The current procedures for handling passports in Hong Kong are slightly different from the previous method. Applicants must undergo strict review by the issuance office and must be guaranteed by local gentry, merchants, or firms in Hong Kong before they can be issued. If any suspicious points are found, the office will refuse to issue the visa. Passports to various countries' territories must be signed by the respective consuls in Hong Kong before they can go abroad. The fees for merchants' passports are four Hong Kong dollars for the passport fee and two dollars for the stamp tax, totaling six dollars. Workers and students should pay two dollars for the passport fee and two dollars for the stamp tax, totaling four dollars. The passport date is about four or five days. The above passport procedures are temporary measures, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may change them in the future.

### Shipping Special

The Chinese Prince, a ship of the Prince Line, set sail from New York yesterday and arrived in Hong Kong via Shanghai. It will arrive at Kowloon Wharf Bridge at 8 o'clock tonight. The cargo carried by the ship is about 1,000 tons. After the cargo is unloaded, it will sail into the Taikoo Dockyard for routine repairs. Also, the Silvercedar, which is also operated by the same line, may arrive in Hong Kong tomorrow.

The Japanese Empress, owned by Changxing Company, arrived in Hong Kong from Luzon this morning and is docked at Kowloon Wharf Bridge. After unloading passengers and cargo, it will also enter the dock for repairs. It will set sail at noon on the 24th of this month (Tuesday) to Shanghai, Kobe, Osaka, Honolulu, Canada, Vancouver, and other ports.

### From London to Paris (2)

— Zhizheng

I plan to live in Europe for at least a month, and I also want to visit countries such as Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium. Therefore, a month is not enough. I had to follow the regulations, fill out an application, and wait for a decision. From June 11th, I waited until the beginning of July, when the Paris reply finally arrived. Because I am a student, I probably won't be looking for a job, so I was approved. However, the passport still had the words "The holder of this passport must never undertake paid or unpaid work in France" written in large letters. The consular staff also emphasized this to me. The seriousness of the unemployment problem can easily be found from this small end, a strong rebuttal (England also has the same regulations for immigrants.)

After the passport issue was resolved, I bought a ticket at Thomas Cook. There are four routes from London to Paris. The shortest route is the Dover-Calais route, which has the shortest time in the strait, and the price is relatively expensive. The longest route is the Newhaven-Dieppe route, which also has the longest time in the strait. Needless to say, the price is low. Most ordinary travelers take the Newhaven-Dieppe route. I also chose this route. A one-way third-class ticket costs about one pound and ten shillings. In addition, buy a travel certificate. In the future, you can buy tickets at a 60% discount for travel in Europe. On the morning of July 4th, I took my simple luggage, said goodbye to the landlady I had lived with for a year, and went to Victoria Station alone. I thought I could go early to find a better seat. Who knew that when I arrived at 8:30, the train had not yet arrived. I waited until 9:30 before the train entered the station. At that time, the passengers going to Europe were already crowded. It was hard to get on the train. When I looked at the third-class seats, many of them were labeled "Reserved." It turned out that British railways had a regulation for reserved seats, and the price was one shilling. I had not paid attention to this in advance, so I felt very difficult at the last minute. After running around for a long time, I finally got a seat. At this time, the station announced the wind and wave conditions in the strait, saying, "Light breeze, no fog." The storms in the English Channel are world-famous, so people traveling between England and France are always infinitely wary of crossing the strait. The reason why the Newhaven-Dieppe line is so cheap is precisely because the channel is longer. Everyone saw the report of the car girl, and felt more at ease, but who knows if there will be temporary changes.

The car started at 10:09. After about two hours of travel, it arrived at the British seaport of Newhaven. From here, get off the car and board the "Bristol" ferry. The congestion on the ferry is naturally needless to say. Fortunately, I met a British woman, Mrs. Miah, by chance. She teaches at a university in Edinburgh and often meets with Chinese students. Also, because she has a relative who lived in Fuzhou for many years, she has a special liking for Chinese people. At that time, Mrs. Miah found me a seat and chatted with me about current affairs in China, expressing great emotion. In the midst of a lonely boat, I unexpectedly met someone who truly understood China.

The ship was about to set sail, and suddenly a large group of people boarded, men, women, old and young, about 100 people. Among them, several women could not find seats, so they ran to the ship's rail where Mrs. Miah and I were sitting. After talking to them, I realized that this group of people was actually a Spanish opera troupe. They said, "Because of the war, we have to come out and sell our art to make a living." When I saw their encounters, and thought of myself, I really felt like "We are all wanderers in the world, why did we have to know each other before?" Naturally, when it came to China, they were even more sympathetic. I said, "Where is your home?" Their answer was, "Our home has been destroyed by the war, and in the future, we will only drift in the world." Alas, war is so sinful.

The ship set sail at 12:30. At this point, everyone's attitude seemed a little unnatural. I saw Mrs. Miah staring intently and silently. I asked her, "Are you afraid of seasickness?" Mrs. Miah seemed unhappy and said, "It's best not to mention this." I said, "The wind is very light today, maybe there won't be any problems." Mrs. Miah said, "You have to know, this is in the harbor. Once we leave the harbor, no one knows what the situation will be. When I saw her serious expression, I couldn't help but feel a little nervous.

The ferry left the harbor, and the wind seemed to be a little stronger, but it was also very ordinary. Since I came to England last year, I haven't had a life at sea for almost a year. This time, leaning on the railing and looking into the distance, watching the endless blue sea, lined with a few green mountains, sparkling and vast, I couldn't help but think of the scene of crossing the Indian Ocean last year. How fast time passed. In this short year, the world has changed so much.

There is Western food on the ship, but the price is very high. People who are experienced in going to Europe have already brought large bags of dry food. I don't have this experience. Thanks to Mrs. Miah's kindness, she gave me some meat sandwiches. The members of the opera troupe also invited me to join them for dinner. We chatted for a while and didn't feel lonely at all. They also brought their diary and asked me to write some Chinese characters. They looked at it and felt a strong interest. Finally, I translated their names into Chinese and wrote them on each person's diary, which can be regarded as a memorable thing during the voyage.

The waves were very weak, and Mrs. Miah also began to talk and laugh, but we sitting by the side of the boat were attacked by the sea wind and felt a little cold. Mrs. Miah tightened the velvet blanket all over her body. He looked at me and said, "I think you are very cold, go down to the cabin." Indeed, I couldn't stand it anymore, so I had to go down to the cabin. Not long after, I saw many passengers went down to the cabin. It turned out that the French harbor of Dieppe was vaguely visible in the distance. The three-hour sea journey would be over.

At about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the ship docked at the pier. This time, I finally escaped the anger of the strait. Everyone congratulated each other. Before leaving, Mrs. Miah gave me a mailing address and said, "We can communicate often in the future if we have the chance." After thanking him, I said goodbye. The ends of the earth, I don't know when we will meet again in the future. When I went ashore, the first impression was that "English is no longer valid here." Everyone has to speak French. Just separated by a strait, the language is completely different. At that time, thousands of passengers were waiting for the inspection of French customs officers. There were only two or three customs officers, how could they cope with these passengers in a short period of time? So when checking, it has to be very hasty. This is very different from the British, who want to strictly enforce everything. We can often see the national character of each country from subtle places. French people often do things casually. After arriving in Paris, I got a lot more proof.

After the customs officials finished checking, the special train to Paris was already waiting at the pier. There are very few third-class cars, and almost eight or nine out of ten have been reserved. Therefore, passengers without reservations suffered the same embarrassment as when they got on the train in London. Everyone stared blankly at the empty seats labeled "Reserved". We had to stand temporarily next to the railway track, preparing to stand all the way to Paris. Fortunately, five minutes before departure, some reserved seats that had not arrived were vacated. The waiter invited us in, and we felt relieved. Therefore, I felt that if I have the experience abroad in the future, it is best to reserve seats within the possible range, so that you can save a lot of trouble at the last minute.

From Dieppe to Paris, the special train did not stop along the way, speeding across the French plains. I saw green hills and fields with green walls and vermillion roofs, which was very poetic and picturesque. It is said that among the four routes to France, this line is the most beautiful region. France is an agricultural country and has some similarities with China, but its farming methods have been completely transformed with new tools. As far as I have seen, machine harvesting and machine pumping are very common, but Chinese rural areas can be said to be still in the original period.

"Paris is here." After a burst of noise, everyone walked out of the Saint-Lazare station. I was introduced by a friend and booked at the Shapon Hotel, because it is close to the area where students live. Following the map, I took the subway and changed once. Finally arrived at the desired "Cluny" station. When I came out of the subway, I saw many cafes set up on the streets, already crowded. I had no intention to browse these, asking questions east and west, and finally found the Shapon Hotel, only to find that it was fully booked. There was a hotel next door called "Rhudes," which was also similar to Shapon. I found a room there, which was twice as big as the room I lived in London, but the rent was only 275 francs per month, only a little over nine francs per day, which was surprisingly cheap.

After running around for a long time, taking two trains, and crossing the strait once, I spent a full seven hours on the way. It was inevitable that I was a little tired from traveling back and forth. After having a delicious Chinese meal at the nearby Peking Restaurant, I went back to my residence to rest.

Economic Column

### Losing Territory and Losing Industries: A Sad History of Chinese Industry and Commerce

Regardless of whether it is a matter of public law, private law, wartime, or peacetime, there is no reason for forcibly seizing, annexing, or confiscating the industry and commerce operated by civilians. However, in the temporarily abandoned territories of China, all factories, companies, and large-scale agricultural products have been plundered and controlled by others. Sometimes, they nominally call it cooperation, but in reality, it is like a cuckoo occupying a magpie's nest. What kind of cooperation is there to speak of? What kind of "equality" can be mentioned? In the three northeastern provinces, there is no room for Chinese to operate. Eighty-five percent of the original companies and factories have been transferred to Japanese hands. If this continues, Chinese people will have nowhere to earn a living, and what business can Europeans and Americans hope to do? The following is a description of the devastation based on reports in Japanese newspapers and magazines, to show a glimpse of the destruction.

Entirely Based on Factories in the Shanghai-Songhu Area

After the fall of Shanghai, Japanese merchants came to Shanghai to conduct large-scale activities immediately after the military operations. Not only did they want to restore their original factories, but they also wanted to use means of coercion and enticement to collude with weak-willed Chinese merchants to "cooperate" with them. Those with foresight refused to comply. Although their final fate was inevitably taken over under the so-called "military administration," or taken over by the "pacification team" and entrusted to the local "maintenance association," or even forcibly occupied and reopened by Japanese merchants as a means of plundering wealth. However, this kind of national spirit of preferring to be shattered rather than preserved completely, although it may suffer temporary losses, can still restore its former appearance and develop its business in the end. As for those who are willing to be accomplices, hoping to gain temporary benefits, cooperating with them, or muddling along, entrusting their operations to them, or selling their enterprises in the occupied areas to them, and not realizing that they have fallen into a bottomless abyss, it is very regrettable. According to a recent survey by the Shanghai-based reporter of the Japanese Toyo Keizai Shinpo, in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the yarn factories, silk filatures, flour mills, cement plants, chemical industries, etc., originally operated by Chinese merchants, have already compromised and resumed work in the hands of the Japanese, or are already conducting "joint operations," or have been "forcibly occupied" and started work, as described below:

(1) Textile Industry: In the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, there are currently 37 Chinese-owned yarn factories operated by Japanese, with approximately 600,000 spindles and more than 5,300 looms.

(2) Silk Industry: Silk filatures in Wuxi, Suzhou, the western suburbs of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Huzhou, Jiaxing, Haiyan, Qingpu, and other places are operated by the Sino-Japanese Silk Co., Ltd., in which the Japanese side is the major shareholder (total capital of 8 million Japanese yen, 6 million in cash shares, mainly owned by the Japanese side; the actual paid-up capital is only 3 million, and the remaining 2 million are in-kind shares, which are paid up by the Chinese side based on existing production equipment, etc.).

(3) Flour Industry: The four Chinese flour mills in the suburbs of Shanghai have decided to implement "joint operation" with the "Flour Milling Company" jointly operated by the Japanese Mitsui and Mitsubishi companies. One of the factories is operating on its own. In addition, those who have decided to "cooperate" with the Japanese include the Nanjing Yangzi Flour Mill and Sakamoto Ichizo, and the Wuxi Jiufa Flour Mill and the Shanghai Yoshida Company.

(4) Cement Industry: Those "jointly operated" with the Japanese Ono Demizu Pottery Co., Ltd. include the Shanghai Cement Company and the Nanjing Jiangnan Cement Company. The Nanjing China Cement Company is "cooperatively operated" with the Japanese Iwaki Suimon Pottery Co., Ltd.

(5) The ammonium sulfate plant of the Yongli Chemical Industry Co. in Yongkou has been entrusted to the Japanese Toyo Shoko Industrial Co. for operation and is currently being restored and repaired.

(6) The Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai was placed under the "military administration" of the Japanese Navy a long time ago and is operated by the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co., Ltd.

In addition, the Chinese-owned factories in the four suburbs of Shanghai that are currently "jointly operated" with Japanese merchants and have been verified are said to include the following:

Original Chinese-Owned Factories, Currently Joined by Japanese Merchants

Wuzhou Soap Factory - Japan Oil & Fat Co., Ltd.

Zhongyuan Tobacco Factory - Toyo Leaf Tobacco Co., Ltd.

Xinhua Tobacco Factory - Toyo Tobacco Co., Ltd.

Huadong Tobacco Factory - East Asia Tobacco Co., Ltd.

Huapin Tobacco Factory - East Asia Tobacco Co., Ltd.

Meili Alcohol Factory - Uetani Kisaburo

A Tree Factory - Fujimura Ichiro

China Cold Storage - Former Yonetaro Seisakusho

A Printing Factory - Shanghai Printing Co., Ltd.

Jin Xin Rayon Weaving Factory - Muto Yoko

Zhanghua Woolen Factory (Xiaodong) - Shanghai Weaving Co.

Zhongxin Woolen Textile Factory (Yangshupu) - Zhu Zhifang and Mizuta Ryo

Da Zhonghua Paper Mill (Wusong) - Nikkachu Paper Co., Ltd.

Jiangnan Paper Mill (Caojiadu) - Kanebo Textile Co., Ltd.

Tian Zhang Paper Mill (Yangshupu) - Mizuno Yoshishi

Huaxing Yiji Paper Mill (Suzhou) - Shanghai Paper Co.

A Certain Lumber Factory (Suzhou) - Nomura Lumber Co., Ltd.

A Certain Lumber Factory (Suzhou) - Mitsui & Co., Ltd.

Pudong Enamel (Suzhou) - Nakayama Steel Works

Gongdong Iron Factory (Yangshupu) - Asia Steel Industry Co.

Lide Oil Mill (Zhabei) - Japan Oil & Fat Co., Ltd.

China Home Industry Soap Factory (Zhabei) - Chang Mao Chamber of Commerce

Zhenhua Paint Co. (Zhabei) - Japan Paint Co.

Kailin Paint Company (Jiangwan) - Dai Nippon Toryo Co., Ltd.

It is well known that the above-mentioned "cooperation" is a unilateral propaganda by the Japanese and is not credible. For example, it is not known whether the Wuzhou Soap Factory is the same as the Wuzhou Factory. If it is, the factory has already moved to the interior area and resumed operations, and there is no reason to cooperate with the Japanese. Also, the Meili Alcohol Factory is said to have resumed operations, but the name of the Japanese merchant Uetani Kisaburo appears in this table. The details of other factories are unknown. One hopes that since the Japanese have made this kind of publicity, they can use facts to make a formal statement to correct the public's perception and prevent the means of alienation, destruction, and usurpation. Hopefully, all factories will pay attention to this.

### Overseas Chinese Enthusiastically Celebrate the New Year Yesterday; One-Dollar Movement Launched Simultaneously; Chambers of Commerce and Various Organizations Hold Events Simultaneously; Student Relief Association Holds Entertainment and Barter Fair to Raise Relief Funds

Yesterday was the 28th anniversary of the founding of our Great Republic of China. Moreover, during this national crisis, overseas Chinese from all walks of life here, remembering the difficulties of the late Premier and the martyrs in creating the country, and at a time when we are fighting for freedom and independence against a strong neighbor, had enthusiastic expressions for this great anniversary. At the same time, various overseas Chinese organizations took advantage of the New Year's Day holiday to launch a one-dollar debt repayment movement. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce also promoted various trade guilds and native place associations to hold events separately. The situation in various aspects is recorded separately below.

Market Conditions

The day before yesterday, all overseas Chinese community schools, organizations, and Chinese and Western shops took a day off to celebrate with flags. The national flags of China and the United Kingdom were flying everywhere in the city, and the number of tourists on the streets increased several times compared to usual. For a time, it was crowded and lively. The ferries, trams, and long-distance buses were all very crowded. People from all walks of life took advantage of the holiday to go to Macau for gambling and entertainment, which was even more crowded. The ships departing from Hong Kong were all full. The entertainment venues in various districts were especially crowded, and there were costume dances in various dance halls. Restaurants and tea houses in various districts had three times the usual profits. Peaceful decorations appeared everywhere before one's eyes. While enjoying the banquets and entertainment, did they also have a sense of homesickness that was unbearable to look back on?

Debt Repayment Movement

The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce held a New Year's Day group worship meeting at noon on the fourth floor of the association. During the national crisis, the tea party was also cancelled, and only the ceremony was held. More than 30 people attended the meeting that day. Chairman Li Xingqu delivered a speech, encouraging all colleagues to recognize the current great crisis and take on their own national responsibility. Finally, he shouted the slogan "Long live the Republic of China," and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. The one-dollar debt repayment movement launched by the association also started on that day. In addition to being implemented by the directors of the association, it was also divided among the native place associations and various trade guilds to be held simultaneously. Because the past two days were holidays, the debt repayment funds were changed to be received today. A receipt will be issued for each national currency of one yuan or more. After collecting the funds, they will be presented to the government. Lin Peisheng, chairman of the Guangdong Association, had previously donated 100 yuan for debt repayment and yesterday mobilized all his comrades to donate, with promising results. In addition, the Chinese Women's Association, the Women's War Relief Association, and the Women's New Movement Association were also launched simultaneously and actively carried out. When the Chairman Chen Jianbo of the Shizhen Chamber of Commerce celebrated the New Year's Day the day before yesterday, he initiated a response to the debt repayment movement and issued 20 donation cans, which were distributed by the directors of the association to collect donations. It is expected that the results will be considerable in the future.

Bartering to Raise Funds

The charity entertainment barter fair held by the Hong Kong Students Relief Association was held at St. Paul's College on Iron Hill on the morning of New Year's Day. Ms. Wang Xiaoying presided over the opening ceremony, and then the barter fair began. The order in the venue was extraordinary, and the items were abundant. Half of all the income of the association will be allocated to the association's domestic service team, and half will be used to relieve refugees. Men and women who came to the area on the first day were very crowded. The closing ceremony was held at 5 pm yesterday. It was found that more than 20 schools participated in the barter fair, including Hong Kong Shang, St. Joseph's, YWCA, St. God, Yangzhong, Zhixian, Women's Normal, St. Paul's, Lizhe, King's College, Overseas Chinese Wah Yan Branch, South Commercial, Fanglin, Xiao, Hanzhong, Huade, Queen's College, Continuing Education, Overseas Chinese College, Zhonghua, South China, Huaxia, Guangda, Jinling, Children's Group, St. Paul's, etc. It is heard that the fundraising results were very good.

Ambulance Donation Ceremony

The Kowloon-Hong Kong Education Association held an ambulance donation ceremony at the sports field of the Public Works Department in Causeway Bay on the morning of New Year's Day. More than a thousand teachers, staff, and students from various schools participated, and the atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Mr. Lan Chunlin, a representative of the Guangdong Provincial Ambulance Committee, personally arrived at the venue to receive the donation. The meeting was held with due ceremony. Wang Shutao delivered the opening speech, Chen Tie reported on the fundraising and ambulance purchase process, and Zhang Lanzhou read the ambulance donation speech.

After that, a wartime ambulance drill was performed, and the meeting adjourned.

### Daluoxian Hotel Forced to Move by Landlord; Refusal to Renew Lease Even with Voluntary Rent Increase; More Than 400 Guests Evacuated in a Mess Yesterday

The Daluoxian Hotel at 88-102 Des Voeux Road Central, Hong Kong, has been leasing and operating since 1934, and has been operating smoothly for several years. However, it suddenly announced its closure on the 28th of last month, and more than 400 guests were evacuated in a mess. At the same time, a notice was posted in front of the store stating the reason. The original text is recorded below, saying, "The landlord of 'XXXX' and other businesses is forcing us to move. After ten years of operation, we are forced into bankruptcy. All the employees of the store are unemployed at once, and the compatriots who live here are forced to flee in a mess. It is painful and heartbroken for the wealthy XXXX. Please, sir, pray for your consideration. Daluoxian sincerely writes."

All Equipment Automatically Destroyed

As of yesterday, the store had dismantled all of its own items and moved the furniture and other items. People who were watching the events were surprised by this action. Yesterday morning to night, many people gathered at the store to watch. When the reporter asked the person in charge of the store about the situation, they replied that since the lease of the building, they had never been in arrears with rent. Moreover, the business has improved slightly in recent years, and the value of the store is as high as 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. About six months ago, they received a notice from the landlord Guo X (the son of the wealthy Hong Kong businessman Guo XX, who passed away two years ago), asking them to move out within three months. The owner of the store pleaded repeatedly and promised to provide the rent at the value of others, but did not receive a reply. Thinking that the industry was aware of the difficulties of doing business, the order to take back the shop was rescinded, and they continued to operate with peace of mind.

Reason for Forced Eviction: Shop Run by Competitor

Until recently, they suddenly received a notice from the landlord, requiring them to move out within one month. The store learned that the reason why the landlord took back the shop was that a competitor's shop would be opened on the original site. Therefore, the store would rather sacrifice the store and demolish it completely than transfer it. It has been closed since the 28th of last month, and at that time more than 400 guests were evacuated in a mess. It is found that the housing problem in Hong Kong has become serious, and the Daluo Hotel being ordered to move is just one example. If the government does not solve it in a proper way as soon as possible, the future is unimaginable.

At the Mat Tau Chung refugee camp in Kowloon City, there were originally soldiers stationed in our group. However, at around 3:00 PM yesterday, the soldiers in the camp somehow had a verbal argument with the Indian soldiers who were monitoring the refugee camp, and then they started fighting. After a while, a gunshot was suddenly heard, and one Indian soldier, A, was shot in the abdomen, and another soldier, B, was stabbed in the back with a bayonet. Seeing this situation, the camp manager immediately telegraphed for a Red Cross car to come to the scene and sent the two wounded to Kowloon Hospital for treatment.

### Chinese Art Association to Commemorate Ye Duanren Today; Commemorating a Young Soldier Who Died in the Line of Duty

Ye Duanren (Guobin), the third executive director of the Chinese Art Association, joined the Hong Kong Xijiang Qili Guild's Return to the Country Service Group a few months ago and went to the Xijiang area to engage in national salvation propaganda and other battlefield work. He worked extremely hard. Recently, at the invitation of the Yunfu County People's Self-Defense Corps Command, he served as the political instructor of the county's Self-Defense Corps. In the middle of last month, while on official business from Yunfu to Xinxing, he happened to encounter X aircraft bombing and was unfortunately murdered by lawless soldiers who took the opportunity to loot his property and kill him to silence him. Now, the comrades of the association believe that Mr. Ye bravely participated in the war of resistance and died for his country, which is extremely sad. A memorial service will be held at 1:00 PM today at the association's address at 751 Nathan Road, Mong Kok. Members of the association and friends of Mr. Ye will be notified to attend at that time to express their condolences and encourage the future. It is found that Mr. Ye's original name was Guobin, also known as Duanren, pen name Mojun, 29 years old this year, from Xinxing County. He has been engaged in the news business in Hong Kong for many years and has served as an editor for the Hong Kong Dagguang Daily, Dazhong Daily, and Life Daily. He has written a lot. His writings have frequently appeared in the supplements of Life Daily and Dazhong Daily in previous years, and recently in the supplements of the Hong Kong Commercial Daily, Pearl River Daily, and Independence Daily, as well as other magazines. He has progressive ideas, treats people sincerely, and has always been valued by colleagues in the literary and cultural circles. Now, he has suddenly been killed, and all parties are mourning him endlessly. It is heard that celebrities from the cultural, educational, and news circles in Hong Kong, as well as friends of Mr. Ye, have written articles and sent elegiac couplets to express their condolences.

### Journalists Association Will Also Issue a Declaration

Since Wang Jingwei shamelessly issued a proposal to the central government, echoing the arrogant statement issued by the X cabinet on the evening of the 22nd, the world was in an uproar. It was generally believed that Wang's move was shaking the belief of the officials and people of our country in long-term resistance to Japan. Moreover, the Central Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee joint meeting also decided to permanently expel Wang from the country and deprive him of all his powers and duties due to Wang's proposal. The Women's War Relief Association, the Hong Kong Women's New Movement Association, the China Noble Year Ambulance Corps, the Motorcycle Research Federation, etc.

Journalists Association to Issue Declaration

The Hong Kong Journalists Association believes that Wang once had a historical position in the party and the country. Now, he has suddenly issued this proposal, and its impact must be great. In order to dispel public doubts and clarify the wrong claim, at the association's third executive committee and supervisory committee joint meeting yesterday, it was decided to support the central government's resistance to the end and oppose Wang Jingwei's proposal for peace. It is heard that the content of the official statement will point out the past course of our country's resistance to Japan and the advocacy of resistance to the end, and affirm that only by resisting to the end in this war can we achieve final victory. Any compromise will lead to destruction. And Wang's proposal this time is originally in response to the 近衛之主 of the X cabinet, intending to eliminate our belief in resistance through the smoke screen of peace talks, which must be strictly corrected in order to correct the general view. It is heard that the declaration has already been drafted and will be issued during the day.

### Kuang Guangyin Hosts Press Conference to Report on the Collection of Exhibits

### Knowing the Law and Breaking the Law: Two Firefighters Steal During a Fire; Hu Shi and Chen Jianwu Both Jailed

At about 3:00 AM last Saturday morning, a fire broke out at 76 Qi Jiedun Street. British Constable Tai, who was guarding the buildings opposite the fire scene, discovered that firefighter Hu Shi was stealing a handful of darts on the second floor of No. 47. After being released on bail, he was imprisoned for disciplinary action. Until yesterday morning, another firefighter named Chen Chuangwu was released on bail to Central Magistracy He Sitang, accused of stealing silver coins and cufflinks, and other items from the resident Huang Bin on the second floor of No. 45. According to Tai Lai's testimony, when he patrolled to that place, he saw that the door of the building was tightly closed, and there was a dog barking inside. Tai Lai peered through the crack and felt that there were shadows moving. Then he broke down the door and saw the defendant coming out of the back room, and then discarded the items on the chair. The victim testified that the items were stored in the drawer. When the fire broke out, all the residents of the building fled. After the interrogation, the official ruled that the defendant was a public official and dared to steal by relying on his position, which was illegal, and sentenced him to three months of hard labor. He Si praised Tai Lai for repeatedly solving similar cases.

### A Heroic Act on the Waters of Lingdingyang; Our Two Fishing Boats Bravely Resist and Sink Four X Boats; Six or Seven X Sailors Die at Sea; More Than Ten of Our Fishermen Also Heroically Sacrifice

Since X warships blockaded the coast of South China, fishermen have been poisoned and harmed. Fishermen in Hong Kong have suffered especially severely. Until recently, it seemed to have decreased on the surface, but in fact, there are still many victims. However, after the fishermen are in distress, most of them have not reported it due to the fact that the procedures are not in place. Recently, there was an incident of X warships forcibly seizing fishing boats on the Henglan Sea, and at the same time, there was an incident of fishermen heroically resisting X on the waters of Lingdingyang, resulting in the sinking of four X boats and the drowning of six or seven people. More than ten fishermen heroically sacrificed. The details are described as follows:

Bravely Resisting X and Sinking Four Boats

It is found that Lin Shanjun, a fisherman from Cheung Chau, sailed two Guanghai fishing trawlers with more than 40 partners on the 27th of last month to go out to sea for fishing. When they sailed to the waters of Lingdingyang, they encountered an X warship. Lin and others knew that it was difficult to escape, so they ignored it and did not run away. They also prepared everything to wait for the X people to come and fight them. They were not willing to coexist. Before long, the X warship sent out four rubber speedboats to approach the boat and try to forcibly board it. Lin and others knew that the time had come, so they ordered their partners to fire cannons at the X. With a loud bang, four X boats were hit and sank, and about six or seven X sailors in the boats died at sea.

Fishermen and Fishing Boats Burned by X

At that time, in addition to Lin Shanjun's two Guanghai fishing trawlers, there was also a Zhapo trawler with more than ten people on board. After the incident, the three-story fishing boat tried to set sail and escape, but it was discovered by X people. An armed speedboat was sent to chase them, and the Zhapo trawler was intercepted by the X ship first. X soldiers boarded the ship with weapons, with great momentum. First, they detained everyone in the cabin, buckled the cabin door backwards, then sprinkled kerosene on various parts of the ship, set it on fire, and burned it to the ground in an instant. More than ten people were heroically sacrificed. After burning the boat, the X soldiers crossed to Lin Shanjun's two Guanghai trawlers, searched them, and then dragged them to Yizhou near Macau. They drove more than ten people on the boat to a lonely island, and then left the boat. Several hours later, a boat passed by and carried Lin and others to Macau, and took a boat back to Hong Kong to report the incident to the Fishermen's Association.

X Robs Fishing Boat on Henglan Sea

On the afternoon of the 27th of last month, at 3:00 PM, there was another incident of X robbing a fishing boat on the Henglan Sea. The fishing boat involved was No. 3366HW. At that time, the fishing boat was fishing in the waters of Henglan, in the British territorial waters. It suddenly encountered an armed X fishing boat. Before they could escape, X soldiers forcibly boarded the boat and searched it. As a result, they robbed property worth a total of 4,000 yuan, and turned over all the ship's license and all the items on the ship, and then swaggered away after the robbery. Fortunately, there were no casualties. The boat had already sailed back to Aberdeen on the 30th to report to the association.

### Sham Shui Po, So Uk Village: Seven Robbers Loot Thatched House and Flee

In Sham Shui Po, So Uk Village, a thatched house without a clear address was suddenly invaded by seven black-clad robbers wielding short guns at 7:55 PM last night. The owner and his family were threatened by the robbers, who ransacked the house, seizing clothing and money before fleeing. The owner later reported the incident to the Sham Shui Po Police Station, and detectives were immediately dispatched to investigate. All district police stations were also notified to assist in the apprehension.

### Failed Resumption of Shipping Between Guangdong and Hong Kong; Resumption of Transportation Between Guangdong and Macau; × Claims Weekly Service, Limited to × Persons and Sino-Portuguese Passengers

Since × occupied Guangzhou, water and land transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong has remained blocked. ×, seeking to monopolize shipping rights on the Pearl River, has refused to allow any external interference. Consequently, Rear Admiral Noble, the British Naval Commander in China, previously proposed opening the Pearl River to the × forces invading Guangzhou, but without success. Negotiations were terminated, and no further attempts have been made. Guangzhou remains a dead city amidst chaos. Recently, ×, in order to maintain external transportation for Guangzhou, shifted its focus to Macau. On the 22nd of last month, an armed × vessel was dispatched from Guangzhou to Macau. On the 25th, it returned from Macau, transporting mail from various parties routed through Macau to Guangzhou. Transportation between Guangdong and Macau has thus been restored. According to × sources, a ship will now travel between Guangzhou and Macau once a week. Passengers are strictly limited to Chinese citizens and × nationals. However, as Macau is a Portuguese colony, Portuguese citizens may also travel due to the environment. Other nationalities will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Each voyage will be limited to a maximum of thirty passengers, who must obtain travel permits from the × consuls in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, as well as from the Guangzhou Naval and Military Commander, before boarding.

### Disaster Relief for Victims of Robbery; Widespread Suffering in Boluo County; County Seat and Surrounding Villages Devastated; Relief Committee Dispatches Representatives to Hong Kong to Appeal for Aid

The recent fall of the East River region has devastated Huiyang, Boluo, and Zengcheng counties, with Boluo suffering the most severe impact. There are over 40,000 refugees. The Boluo County Relief Committee has dispatched standing committee members Liu and Huang Jinyong to Hong Kong and Macau to seek aid from fellow countrymen, overseas Chinese, and charitable organizations. Mr. Liu and Mr. Huang arrived in Hong Kong yesterday and have reported on the disaster situation to various sectors, seeking clothing donations. They described the dire situation in the county to reporters as follows:

Boluo County Seat Reduced to Rubble

According to reports, hundreds of shops in Boluo County have been reduced to rubble. This is because, two or three days before the county fell (October 12th to 15th), it was heavily bombarded. After × forces captured the county, they set fires, leaving seven or eight thousand residents without shelter. Most ancestral halls and temples were also burned. Even those that escaped destruction suffered from leaking roofs and damaged walls. Other major towns in various districts were also completely destroyed, such as Paiwei Market in the second district, Xiangshui Market and Batang Market in the third district, and Futian Market and Changning Town in the fourth district. Each of these towns had at least hundreds of shops, now reduced to flat ground. The surrounding villages of the aforementioned towns were also almost entirely destroyed. Farmers, fearing massacre, did not dare return home to harvest their winter rice, so even a bountiful harvest was essentially lost. Almost all villages along the roads near the entire county suffered terribly, affecting over two thousand households.

Over Three Thousand People Killed

In the villages attached to the county seat alone, besides the county seat itself, Tianpai and Yihe villages were mostly burned down. In the second district, besides Paiwei, Zhongtu and Xiunv Lake villages were devastated. Lian'an in the third district, and Guoshi, Lianhe, and Qingdeng in the fourth district were . In short, out of the entire county's thirty-five villages, seventeen have , resulting in over three thousand civilian deaths. Women, children, and the elderly were fortunate to escape to the mountains, but due to malnutrition and exposure to mountain mists and miasma, most are now ill. Furthermore, the severe cold weather and lack of clothing exacerbates their plight. The provincial government has allocated 15,000 yuan for emergency relief, and the 157th Division has donated about 200 bags of rice. However, this is just a drop in the bucket. The Relief Committee finds it difficult to provide adequate assistance. The disaster is severe, and there are many refugees. Without the help of our fellow countrymen and overseas Chinese, it will be impossible to fulfill even the minimum required tasks.

### American Reporter Herbert Investigates the War Situation in China; Arrives in Hong Kong from America Yesterday

Mr. Herbert, a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday with his wife aboard the "Peter Miers." According to him, the newspaper pays particular attention to the profound significance of the Far East conflict in global relations and plans to establish a column dedicated to Far Eastern issues. This trip is on behalf of the newspaper to conduct on-the-ground investigations. He will stay in Hong Kong for a short period and plans to take the "Beysher" to Cape Town on the 5th of this month. He hopes to fully understand the impact of the current war on America during his stay in Hong Kong.

### A Westerner in Tai O Reports Multiple × Warships Passing Through Hong Kong Waters Daily; Their Destination is Unknown, Seeming to Indicate Some Kind of Plan

According to a Westerner who arrived in Hong Kong from Tai O yesterday, three Japanese warships passed through the waters west of Hong Kong's territorial sea, near Tai O, at dusk yesterday. Several smaller motorboats followed. The warships were not very large and were all heading west. Their destination is unknown. Later that day, two more Japanese warships headed south. They were clearly visible from Tai O. An armed fishing boat accompanied these warships.

### Peterson's Ambition Finally Realized; The "Peng Cheng" Sailboat Left Hong Kong Yesterday for America; A Brief Stop in Singapore Before Continuing

Australian Peterson's plan to sail around the Cape of Good Hope to America aboard the sailboat "Peng Cheng" was initially scheduled for Christmas Day, but was delayed due to unforeseen circumstances. This was previously reported in the newspaper. Despite setbacks, Mr. Peterson persevered and finally set sail from the bay on Saturday afternoon. Passing ferries all wished him a safe journey. Accompanying Mr. Peterson on this voyage are two Americans, Zhu Lier and Bao Xieer, a Danish man, Morgan Xin, a Chinese cook, and an Indian crew member, a total of seven people. He has prepared ten thousand US dollars for the construction and equipment costs of the ship, which he believes is sufficient to cover the entire journey. Before departure, there were reports of turbulent winds and waves in the South China Sea, but Mr. Peterson believes this is the best opportunity to test the safety of his ship. The ship's sail area is 3,600 square feet. If the wind is favorable, the journey will be quite fast. He plans to stop in Singapore for a considerable period of time to replenish supplies and food before embarking on the arduous voyage around the Cape of Good Hope. The ship is also equipped with a radio telegraph, operated by Mr. Fei Xieer, which will communicate with the world. A travel report will be broadcast every evening at 8:00 PM.

### Adorning the Victorious New Year; A Sketch of an Extraordinary Gathering; The Anniversary Celebration of the Printing Industry Workers' Union

Confucius Hall on New Year's Day was covered with such red couplets: "To seek benefits, one must fulfill obligations"; "Improve our lives under fair and reasonable principles"; "Workers and employers unite to increase wartime production"; "Respond to the One Yuan Movement to revive the Chinese nation"; "..." The anniversary celebration of the Hong Kong Printing Industry Workers' Union was held in such a hall.

The workers changed out of their oily and dirty work clothes and put on new clothes; this rare "daytime" was a blessing for those accustomed to "night work"; each of them collectively celebrated the New Year with "joyful" smiles; each of them was filled with unlimited hope for the New Year.

"Workers: May your New Year be filled with happiness! You are powerful promoters of social progress"—the reporter sincerely pays you the highest respect.

Happy New Year, salutations, reports, speeches, proposals... The opening ceremony passed by. But what deeply moved the reporter was their singing and tea party.

Most of the choirs we usually see belong to young students and schoolchildren; however, this choir of the Printing Industry Workers' Union, roaring on the stage, was composed entirely of workers who had left school. More than thirty of them lined up in two rows, with several female workers in the middle wearing braids, some makeup, and new green clothes, occasionally laughing shyly and happily, as if proudly showing off that they were not just someone's daughter-in-law, not playthings of the powerful, but workers who, by their own labor, were promoting social progress. Although they were older and surrounded by the suffering of material life, they still sang and retained their youth. How moving this is!

There was also a group of older male workers with wrinkles etched on their faces by wind and frost, wearing long "merchant-style" robes, who actually opened their throats and sang patriotic songs, as if proudly showing off that they were not greedy merchants who only seek profit; proudly showing off that they could still be as innocent as their children, younger brothers, and younger sisters. How inspiring this is!

They sang seven or eight patriotic songs in a row: "He killed our compatriots," "He forcibly occupied our land"... The seeds sown in Hong Kong by the Wuhan Chorus have even sprouted in workers' groups. The heart-shaking national songs made people realize that they were in the midst of the great era.

The tea party for the guests was set up in a small corner of the courtyard; the arrangement of the tables and chairs and the simple refreshments piled high on the wooden tables fully demonstrated the true nature of the workers. Although it was not as luxurious as a banquet in a certain restaurant, the workers' genuine expressions made people feel appreciated and loved.

After the tea party, Mr. Lin Guangfu, the person in charge of the union, told the reporter: There are more than 5,000 printing workers in Hong Kong, and more than 3,000 have joined the union.

Regarding the work the union has done in the past, in addition to participating in the national salvation movement to the extent possible, it has achieved considerable success in Mandarin classes, singing, first aid, drama, and sports. In the New Year, it will strengthen and expand current affairs discussions. Industrial technology improvement seminars, common sense seminars, and other self-education activities will also be held. We sincerely hope that the workers will strive to improve their cultural level and standard of living in this New Year of national revival.

Returned from this interesting gathering on New Year's Day with an excited heart. (Qi Zhuo)

### The Secret to Getting Rich Quick

— Zhu Yuping

Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: There is no disparity between rich and poor in China, only the difference between great poverty and small poverty. Indeed, if we compare China's rich with the wealthy elites of Europe and America, they are truly pitiful - why is China only poor, not rich? The reason is: Because China is a semi-colony, we are subjected to the economic oppression of imperialists.

The poor cannot even eat their fill of vegetable roots; the rich can ride in cars, live in foreign houses, and eat fancy meals. Who doesn't hope to be rich and enjoy the taste of cars, foreign houses, and fancy meals? However, it seems that most people cannot. Dr. Sun Yat-sen told us: We must eliminate the oppression of the aggressors and earn back the wealth of our nation, and then we can live a good life. Therefore, people only think about how to get money. The methods they think of generally fall into two categories: one is to work hard and save frugally, hoping to accumulate some money; the other is to engage in speculative gambling, hoping to get rich by chance. Thus, in this impoverished China, the practice of speculative gambling seems to be particularly prevalent - this has its social roots.

Catering to this psychological demand, many tricks such as teaching shortcuts to wealth have emerged in society. Recently, I found an advertisement in the newspaper teaching a shortcut to wealth. The gist of it is: At this time when everyone feels the pain of unemployment, I can teach you a shortcut to wealth, but after I teach you, you must serve me unconditionally for three years.

It seems that this so-called shortcut to wealth is probably just teaching vocational skills. Whether it can really lead to wealth remains to be seen.

I remember that a few years ago, a certain tycoon - that is, a rich and powerful big shot - died, and many newspapers published his life story in great detail. How did he get rich?

He started as a worker. Relying on saving a little money from his work, he lent that money out to collect interest. This increased his wealth a lot, so he opened a small factory. Relying on the blood and sweat of the workers, his factory developed and defeated other people's factories and merged with other people's factories. In this way, he swallowed up many factories, and he became a giant of trust - a certain tycoon.

This story of getting rich illustrates a principle to us: that certain tycoon got rich by eating the blood of others - interest, the blood and sweat of workers, and the blood and sweat of other small capitalists - making himself fat. This is a true picture of the cruel exploitation of capitalism.

However, in China, this semi-feudal society, there is an even more cruel system of exploitation: A young man wants to learn a bit of professional technology, he must usually do a lot of labor for the "master," and after learning, he must unconditionally work for the "master" for two or three years without pay. Before the time limit expires, he has no freedom to work - this is the so-called "apprenticeship system."

That gentleman who teaches shortcuts to wealth is just using a social psychology, using getting rich to recruit apprentices. If he can recruit hundreds of apprentices to give him unconditional "service" for a few years, he himself will get rich by eating the blood of hundreds of people. This unreasonable apprenticeship system should be eliminated in the process of resisting Japan and building the nation.

### The Sorrow of Private First Class Sato

— Li Liwen

—A Story Drawn From a Japanese Account

"Ah—that is," Kanatani replied in surprise, "that's a terrible thought. Why do you suddenly ask that?"

"This thought has been haunting my mind for a long time—don't you ever think about it?"

Kanatani put his hands in his army trouser pockets, shrugged his shoulders, and said in a melancholy tone:

"I simply don't dare think so freely!"

"Why—are you afraid of something?"

"Worried about going crazy because of it?"

"But these thoughts just keep coming up!" Sato said, frowning.

Kanatani sighed, raised his head, and looked at the sky.

On the other side of the path, two soldiers with urns of ashes hanging on their chests were talking about something on the hillside.

"There's no hope of replenishing the unit either," Kanatani muttered to himself.

"This war..."

Sato's attention was suddenly drawn to the corpse of a Chinese soldier lying beside the road.

"Our end will be like this too," he thought, and immediately said to Kanatani.

Kanatani didn't answer silently, his high shoulders were trembling slightly. Obviously, he was disturbed by the agitation of his emotions.

He murmured; "We're really being sacrificed! If the family expects news of death"...

But Kanatani's point didn't catch Sato's attention at all, he fell into another train of thought...

He suddenly said to Kanatani like this: "I heard that some people in other units have already opposed the war, is that right?"

"I heard some too,"

"I wonder how it's going?"

"This, the officers forbid it very strictly," Kanatani smiled bitterly: "But I heard that quite a few were shot."

Sato then remembered, three weeks ago, when the Nakamura unit was stationed in ×× County, he had indeed heard a soldier in another unit say that several dozen soldiers who had been transferred back from the front line had been secretly executed that morning. "That's probably because they've been fighting for a long time," he guessed.

"Tomorrow we have to start fighting again," Kanatani said with a sigh.

"Yes, maybe we'll only live through today."

As Sato spoke, he fell into deep melancholy and sorrow again, he imagined, as if a high wall had sprung up before his eyes. That high wall was really high, standing high, blocking the sea, blocking his hometown and family on the other side of the sea, blocking the sky and the sun, he felt that that high wall was separating him from life...

The weight of a thousand pounds of melancholy and sorrow pressed on his heart so heavily that Sato even wanted to draw his gun and end his life.

(The End)

### The Autumn Wind Rises

— Li Ruochuan

Fences,

Fields,

Wilderness,

The autumn wind rises.

Crickets chirping everywhere,

Complaining bitterly about a year of war.

Today,

Our children resisting Japan, still,

Put on their uniforms,

Quietly awaiting this solemn bugle call,

The prelude to war,

Galloping on the fields of blood,

In the daytime,

In the nighttime,

Listening to the crow's cry,

Watching the moon set,

A desolate scene,

Cannot shake our conviction in victory.

Our spirited ambition,

In the trenches,

Guarding countless dark nights,

Everyone is anticipating,

A new dawn.

At that time,

The autumn wind rises,

Shivering,

Fallen leaves,

It is an endless desolation again,

As if having crossed a mountain,

Another stream of boundless misty water.

Only ah,

Next year,

At this time,

Outside the threshold,

To every peaceful family,

The autumn wind is howling:

Children fighting for survival,

You have won your first anniversary of victory.

### Clearing Away the Filth

— Wang Jianming

The War of Resistance is like a great furnace, those who can withstand the forging within becoming refined steel, and those who cannot becoming dross, and the destination of the dross is usually the garbage heap.

Recently, the attention of the entire country has been focused on the actions of a certain person, and I feel that this is really a waste. For something that was expected, it should not be given such importance when it is realized. This is just as ordinary as dross being dumped on a garbage heap.

Some kind people still hope that she can turn back, and I think this is also superfluous. There have been many well-intentioned admonitions to him in the past, and the severe criticism of his words and deeds has been done to the best of our ability, and the lessons given to him by objective facts cannot be said to be anything less than abundant and cruel, but in the end, they have failed to correct him. He still released fallacies, and his final fall into the dirtiest place is a natural principle. When a person becomes so stubborn that he is unwilling to love himself, if others still harbor kind illusions, it is either too stupid or meddlesome!

The appearance of a few obvious Zheng Xiaoxus and Wang Kemins in the War of Resistance cannot be said to be how great a harm, but it is these things hiding in the large ranks and doing some sneaky things that are the greatest danger! Even if they only play the role of stumbling blocks, they will cause the children of the Republic of China to shed infinite blood. It is a very good phenomenon that they can go to the place where they should go as soon as possible. If there is still something that makes us regret, it is that we have repeatedly failed to bring the national scum of the Wang Kemin type to justice in advance!

If anyone is worried about what bad consequences the departure of a certain person will have, then it is best to go to the garbage heap to see the abandoned dross: trampled by everyone until it is crushed into powder!

Let him go to the place where he should go, and it is important to stick to our right path.

### New Year's Day Festival

— Lie Ke

The sunlight streamed in through the window, and the indoor lamplight, as if conquered, immediately dimmed, blending into a rich, golden-yellow light.

Mrs. Shen woke up especially early today. Opening her eyes, she realized that Yi Zhen and Yi Lun, who had been sleeping at the foot of the bed, had already run out from under the covers. She put on her robe, got out of bed, and repeatedly called out, "Nanny, nanny!"

"Ah! Coming," Nanny He, who had just risen from refugee to nanny, responded and ran upstairs.

"Where did the two children go? Did they put on the two new sets of clothes that were made?"

"I didn't really pay attention, it seems—they're wearing—wearing student uniforms?" Nanny He replied anxiously.

"You—you're really muddle-headed! Call them up here! Don't you want any decency on this good day!" Mrs. Shen angrily instructed her.

Nanny He hurried to the side of the road, called the children back, opened the closet, took out one piece of clothing after another, and busied herself dressing them. After a while, Yi Lun had changed into a sharp-looking Western-style suit, and Yi Zhen had put on a bright woolen sweater over her velvet cheongsam. Mrs. Shen herself also changed into a brand new winter outfit. She pulled the children over, looked carefully at them in the mirror for a while, and smiled contentedly.

"That's more like it, otherwise, how could we go out? Today is New Year's Day, the first day of 1939!"

"Mom—isn't it the first day of the 28th year of the Republic?"

"Who remembers the Republic or not? Anyway, 1939 is correct—oh—this outfit of your mom's is really '1940 style'!"

It turned out that Mrs. Shen, who was usually immersed in mahjong and jokes, had become almost carelessly indifferent to everything and had gotten used to a life of inverted days and nights. Each time, each time, she would excitedly expend her energy, spending the long nights playing mahjong. …

Recently, she suddenly felt the weather turning cold, and the mercury in the thermometer was dropping every day. Even the calendar on her desk had only a few thin pages left. She was surprised to realize: oh, how fast! Another year is over. Indeed, she felt a bit of reluctance and cherished the time that had flown by. But when she thought of another idea, she grinned and said:

"Bad luck year, hurry up and pass! Next year will definitely be smoother. When gambling, at least I won't lose money, right?"

On the last day of the month, she sent Nanny He to school to pick up Yi Zhen and Yi Lun and bring them home.

Today is New Year's Day, which is also the first day of what Mrs. Shen considers to be the most prosperous year. She naturally had an indescribable joy for such a once-a-year auspicious day and beautiful scenery. In addition to significant attention to her clothing, she also prepared for a "perfect feast", and even the interior of the house was tidied up to be pleasing to the eye. After all, she was still a competitive person, and she wanted to take advantage of her son and daughter being in front of her to help her rush through a few things. The first thing was to order Yi Lun to bring an old calendar, turn it over page by page, and carefully examine the blank back. When they encountered accounts written out, such as "Miss Zhang owes ten yuan", "Mrs. Qian owes eight yuan", "Mrs. Cao is short five yuan"... she would instruct Yi Zhen to extract them one by one... After spending half an hour, she finally sorted out this muddled account. Then, she began the second task, wanting to have a heart-to-heart talk with her children, whom she hadn't talked to in a long time.

"Yi Zhen, in the blink of an eye, you'll be graduating. I don't think you need to go to college anymore—in this chaotic world, it's better to stay at home and help with miscellaneous tasks!"

"Who wants to? Didn't Dad send a letter approving it? So, I've decided to return to China to participate in the war of resistance." The sixteen-year-old daughter replied stubbornly. "Hey—so old, and still so disobedient—giving you comfort doesn't please you, you insist on courting death." Before she could finish speaking, she immediately continued with a remorseful tone: "Ah! Muddle-headed, on a good day, saying such inauspicious words, ah! I forgot it's New Year's Day—I should be slapped, I should be slapped, nonsense, nonsense!" At the end, she spat out two thick mouthfuls of phlegm.

"Moreover, Dad's letter said that you can't play mahjong anymore. He said that during this national crisis, playing mahjong is the most evil, worst, and most harmful act against the war of resistance!" Yi Zhen pointed out another way to accuse her!

"Who's going to listen to that old dotard's nonsense... Opening his mouth, 'national crisis', closing his mouth, 'national survival', such deceptive words, it's sickening to hear—good—blame me for playing mahjong, so he's holding onto the money and won't send it! Fine!..."

"Dad's idea is very reasonable. Mom wastes money, of course it's unreasonable." Unexpectedly, the twelve-year-old son also retorted.

"Good, wastes money—what about you two?... Quickly hand over the ten yuan that Nanny He gave you last week!"

"Haha—we donated it to the school for the 'One Yuan Movement'!"

"Hey—it turns out you've become so extravagant."

Mrs. Shen's heart was full of joy, but it was dispelled by the children's mischief. She was very angry in her heart. The children were not yet adults and dared to rebuke their mother so aggressively! Thinking of this, her heart filled with anger, and several hot tears fell from her face, each drop landing on her "1940 style" winter outfit!

Suddenly, several disturbing noises came from outside the window. Mrs. Shen repeatedly called out, "Nanny, nanny!"

"Oh! Coming," Nanny He responded and ran upstairs, her face full of smiles, but when she caught a glimpse of the tearful anger on Mrs. Shen's face, she immediately clouded her face over!

"Auntie, on this good day, who is arguing in front of the door!"

"That—those are the shop assistants from the neighboring few houses, going together to donate—donate to some 'One Yuan Movement'—oh! Madam! I also donated one yuan!"

"Hmm—" Mrs. Shen didn't say anything. She looked at the children's faces standing next to her, but a triumphant smile flew onto their cheeks.

### Singapore Chinese Football Team to Come to Hong Kong for Matches in Early March; Schedule of Three Matches in Hong Kong Confirmed

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Hong Kong and Shanghai have now become isolated islands, but Hong Kong's football scene is much livelier than Shanghai's.

Last year's Hong Kong-Shanghai埠 (埠 can mean port/large city with port) competition was originally scheduled for the Hong Kong team to travel to Shanghai for matches, but due to the unstable environment in post-war Shanghai, the Hong Kong team did not dare to make the trip. Last autumn, Shanghai once again sent a message, inviting the Hong Kong team to go north and hold a competition on the Lunar New Year's Day. However, the Hong Kong team also did not accept the invitation, instead inviting the Shanghai team to come south. The Shanghai team also considered it difficult to travel, so the埠inter-city competition was still suspended this year.

Just recently, the Singapore Chinese team sent Xu Jukun to Hong Kong to discuss the matter of coming to Hong Kong for matches during the Lunar New Year. The South China Athletic Association believed that since there would be no inter-city competition at that time, the Singapore team's willingness to come was a good opportunity. After several contacts, it has been finalized.

It is now confirmed that the Singapore team will depart from Singapore on February 27th and arrive in Hong Kong on March 3rd. Three matches have been scheduled in Hong Kong, with the following schedule:

March 4th (Saturday): Singapore Chinese Team vs. Hong Kong All-Stars

March 5th (Sunday): Singapore Chinese Team vs. South China Athletic Association

March 8th (Wednesday): Singapore Chinese Team vs. South China Athletic Association or Hong Kong-Singapore Chinese All-Stars vs. Military All-Stars

### Charity Football Match: Regular Army Wins by One Goal; Ms. Lin Qimei Presents Awards On-Site

The Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Sports Community Service Corps, initiated by the South China Athletic Association, held a charity football match at加山 (Ka Shan - possibly a location name) yesterday. The "Regular Army" and "Guerrilla Force" groups played the main roles. The players of the Regular Army were all top players from this year's league, while the Guerrilla Force mostly consisted of retired veterans, each with their own history. Before the match, no one could predict which team would win. However, by the end of the match, the Regular Army ultimately "didn't lose" by a score of 1-0 (Chen Bingtu scored).

Li Huitang, the main player of the Guerrilla Force, was still recovering from a foot injury and attended the match on crutches as a spectator. The team lost its commander, which inevitably reduced its combat effectiveness. However, Ying Jie (Lin Yuying) and Wu Jinquan, who had retired for a long time, still put on a good performance, and their energy was quite sufficient. Returning to the field again, they still have potential. (Regular Army)

Although yesterday was a holiday, the audience was not crowded. Presumably, some fans took advantage of the holiday to wander in other places. The total ticket revenue for the entire game was over one hundred and ten yuan, and the sale of flowers and lottery tickets got 8- yuan and 32 cents, Numbers on the prize-winning lottery tickets were (1) 329, (2) 822, (3) 1477, (4) 1908, (5) 1139, (6) 1848. The first prize was a set of porcelain bowls and dishes (donated by South China Athletic Association), two footballs (donated by China Department Store), a Chinese painting (donated by Service Corps), a green cylinder (donated by Singapore Electrical Appliances), cosmetics (donated by Baijiali). The second and third prizes were a painting, a cylinder, and cosmetics. The fourth, fifth, and sixth prizes were a "Tan Rongguang heart-shaped" character, a flashlight, and cosmetics.

After the match, Ms. Lin Qimei, wife of Dr. Ma Chaoqi, held the award ceremony. The members of the Guerrilla Force and the Regular Army went on stage one by one to receive awards, and the scene was very lively.

### South China to Hold a Variety Show

All kinds of performances are in progress. Planning is complete. The content is divided into music, singing, drama, and Chinese martial arts. The order is very rich. All members of the Association can use their membership cards to go to加山場館 (Ka Shan venue) from the 9th of this month to receive entrance tickets.

### Another Dramatic Battle for the Silver Shield: St. Joseph's Eliminates the Navy; Bidu's Attack Leads to a 3-2 Victory

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday was still the New Year holiday, and there were many battles in the football city. The Silver Shield Group A football match between St. Joseph's and the Navy was held at the Navy field.

Since St. Joseph's obtained大告山奴 (Da Gao Shan Nu), 比路度 (Bidu), 雷米 (Lei Mi) etc. to play for them again, their military power has greatly increased. Yesterday, when they encountered the Navy in the Silver Shield competition, everyone expected a dramatic battle. Therefore, there were one or two thousand Chinese and Western fans in the audience.

St. Joseph's victory this time was entirely due to their skill in using both wings as a vanguard, and they had many opportunities to attack from the flanks. Therefore, although they initially conceded two goals, because the two wings发挥 (fā huī – to bring into play) to their declarations and the three刺 (cì – to stab, thrust) were forceful, after tying the game, they added another goal to eliminate the Navy 3-2.

大告 (Da Gao) initially served as center forward, but he is near-sighted, and because the sunlight was dazzling, he soon switched to right inside forward, but his performance was not very good, but his momentum was fierce, enough to make the Navy defenders fear him.

Bidu is good at attacking, so he scored the third goal, and his skill in passing in the middle has returned to its original level. The frontline's ability to move constantly is largely due to his efforts.

Apart from the two goals conceded, 馬癸士 (Ma Guishi) only encountered dangerous shots three times, which proves that the defense was very solid. 吳德榮 (Wu Derong), 雷米迪 (Lei Miti), and 憂仙 (You Xian) all made good contributions.

The Navy's elimination was not a failure due to inferior skills but a failure to seize opportunities. The number of advances made by their frontline was no less than that of St. Joseph's, and they were faster. In the second half,岩士當 (Yan Shidang) and 懇地 (Ken Di) each approached the goal once and shot, but were saved by 馬癸士 (Ma Guishi). This obvious weakness is the failure to seize the opportunity to score.

The game was very tense. Shortly after the start, Navy center forward 鍾十 (Zhong Shi) broke through 沙 (Sha)'s defense and scored the first goal, opening the scoring. In the blink of an eye, 鍾士 (Zhong Shi) attacked again, taking advantage of a gap to break through another barrier. Seeing that the Navy was scoring so easily, everyone believed that victory would undoubtedly belong to the Navy.

However, the battle was most varied. Joseph was determined to recover lost ground and counterattacked fiercely. In less than five minutes, 李安納 (Li Anna) and 大告 (Da Gao) each scored a goal, tying the score. Counting both sides' gains and losses, less than fifteen minutes, it was really fast.

In the second half, the two sides attacked and defended each other, and the situation was tense. Although the Navy's attack was not weak, they failed to seize opportunities and missed the final shot at the goal, so they failed to score again.

Later, St. Joseph's seized the opportunity. 比路度 (Bidu) took advantage of 加士地路 (Jia Shidilu)'s corner kick and scored, creating a 3-2 victory. (Tai)

### Two Football Matches: From the End of the Year to the Beginning of the Year

[Special Report from This Newspaper] On the last day of 1939, South China and Kowloon Club played a special Silver Shield Group A football match at Kowloon Club field. However, because this venue is traditionally unfavorable to the visiting team, especially to South China, which is good at short passes, although South China's skills and strength surpassed the opponent, they were unable to perform to their full potential on that field and were unable to control the team. After the official 70 minutes of play, they had not yet determined the winner, so they extended it by 20 minutes, but there were no gains or losses. The game ended 0-0, and they will have to replay it another day.

The advantage of South China's offensive strategy lies in its skillful and beautiful short passes. However, the reason why they were unable to win this time was that too many short passes was an undeniable drawback. It must be known that soldiers have no constant strategy, and water has no constant shape. The method of winning in battle has many variations, and football is the same. South China's frontline, playing on that small field, still stubbornly relied on the "single-minded" short passes, not knowing to adapt to the situation, so their advantage became a weakness and was broken by Kowloon's dense defense, to no avail. This proves that the exertion of strength is ultimately not as good as the use of the brain. South China's players had not really thought about the terrain and strategy beforehand, so they did not know how to act according to the circumstances during the game.

Although it can be excused that the players must make short passes to penetrate deeply before shooting because they are not confident in their shots, this field did not allow them to make short passes, so they had to find another way. However, they did not adapt to the situation, and repeatedly made short passes, inevitably leading to the ball being taken away by the opponent. Therefore, although they often occupied the offensive position, they had no effect. Until the extended time, they slightly changed their strategy and adopted more wing side attacks. However, Kowloon was the "local bully," and its performance was particularly outstanding, firmly adhering to its "closed-door policy." South China's forwards could do nothing.

The replay will be at加路連 (Jialu Lian). South China's forwards should be able to perform as they wish on their own field. The victory is believed to be South China's in the end. Moreover, they will also get an extra ticket revenue, which will be split evenly between the two families. This is an extra benefit after the draw.

On New Year's Day, South China will play against Eastern at加山 (Ka Shan), also for the Silver Shield.

This game was still exciting in the first ten minutes or so, but after that it became a mess. The number of fouls was countless. "We are born of the same root, why are we so eager to fry each other?" I want to say nothing.

A glorious defeat is better than an unjust victory. This time, the two teams still drew, so there is no need to discuss right and wrong. But I think that if the referee for this game was not 柴九皋 (Chai Jiugao) but a foreigner, it would not have created such a terrible situation.

I must first declare that Mr. Ye's judgments in this game were extremely clear, his eyes were sharp enough, and there were no mistakes. However, because he is Chinese, the players on both sides do not respect him as much as they respect foreigners. Therefore, although Mr. Ye immediately blew his whistle to penalize any player who performed excessive behavior, they were not afraid at all, treating it as trivial, and committing the same offense again and again, even to the point of being penalized four or five times. There were also five or six people who were reprimanded by Mr. Ye in person, but they never knew how to change. After being penalized, they relapsed into their old habits, and eventually there was the incident of Li 碩友 (Li Shuoyou) being sent off the field.

The players on both sides do not respect Mr. 葉 (Ye), which means they do not respect their own people. It is admirable that Mr. Ye enforces the law like a mountain and handles things appropriately, but they always call Mr. 葉 (Ye) "local ginger is not spicy." This bad mentality despises personality, is ungrateful to Mr. 葉 (Ye), and is ungrateful to the audience.

Throughout the game, South China initially scored two goals (one was scored by 陳德 (Chen De) with a single-handed shot, and the other was scored by 李碩友 (Li Shuoyou) with a free kick), but then 林德 (Lin De) was injured, and both attack and defense were affected, so they were attacked forcefully by Eastern and fell into a bitter battle. Then 李德奇 (Li Deqi) took back a goal in the first half, and the situation in the second half was very bad. Almost as soon as the ball touched the person, it was fouled and penalized due to the competition. However, Eastern was unharmed and its offensive was at its peak. Then 德奇 (Deqi) pushed in a goal in the chaos, tying the score. After the 70 minutes were over, the score was 2-2, and the winner was not decided. In the extended time, there were no more records, and 李碩友 (Li Shuoyou) was sent off the field within the extra time.

Let's wait for the replay to see who will win, but hopefully it won't be as bad as this time. (Football Field Tai Sui (太歲 - mythical chinese deity))

### Hong Kong Club Loses After Hard Fighting: Eliminated by Police Club 2-3

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday's special Silver Shield Group A match between Hong Kong Club and Police Club met at the Hong Kong Club field. In terms of strength, they were evenly matched, and it was not easy to resolve the victory or defeat without a dramatic battle. However, in yesterday's game, Hong Kong Club's lineup was chaotic, and good players such as 福 (Fu) "Fat Shi (肥史)" were absent, weakening their combat power. Although they drew 2-2 in the first half, after the extended time, the Hong Kong Club generals' stamina was insufficient, and the entire army was exhausted, so they were eliminated by the Police Club with a score of 1-3.

This game was chaotic and unremarkable. The Police Club was stronger, so they could control the overall situation. However, the forwards lacked the skill of hitting the mark, so they could not steadily secure victory. The defense was changed to be headed by 柏架 (Bai Jia), but his ball skills were no longer what they used to be. His positioning was inappropriate, and he often gave 阜拉 (Fula) the opportunity to rush. The remaining four Chinese generals were decent, and their actions were civilized.

Because Hong Kong Club lacked good players, their strength was weakened, so they were naturally no match for the police. However, it was still difficult to score two goals first in the first half. All the soldiers have done their best. Yesterday's failure was because their strength was indeed inferior to others, and it was not a crime of war.

There were no games in Group B, and Group A started on time. Hong Kong Club deployed in a favorable wind, and the Police Club resisted against the wind, feeling twice as difficult. The ball came and went, not leaving the middle ground. After five minutes, 阜拉 (Fula) broke open a bloody path, passed it to 江興 (Jiang Xing), and cut in along the side. 衣史杜蘭 (Yi Shidulan) stepped forward to meet it and kicked it casually. The ball took advantage of the wind and landed in front of the goal, just bouncing off the goalpost and falling into the net. 埃健士 (Ai Jianshi) had no time to defend, and it was too late to rescue it. Hong Kong Club opened the scoring 1-0 first. The Police Club, after unexpectedly losing, felt unwilling and launched a chase. 麽士 (Moshi) led the three armies, and they went straight in a long line. 候律 (Hou Lu) twice used a header, but 高路士 (Gao Lusi) closed the door and thanked the guests, refusing to let it pass the net. 江興 (Jiang Xing) took a corner kick, but it was hooked out by 士堅拿 (Shi Jianna) with a big kick, and there was no gap to enter.

Before long, 派路 (Pailu)'s surprise soldier stood out and passed it with a big kick. 阜拉 (Fula) rushed through the siege like a wild boar, and 埃健士 (Ai Jianshi)'s welcome was too late. 阜拉 (Fula) came to the city and shot hard at the door, making another contribution. The first half ended with Hong Kong Club taking the lead 2-0.

Changing sides to fight again, the Police Club had the wind and regained the advantage. The forwards surrounded the enemy's gate, and it was watertight. Hong Kong Club's defense fought back hard and temporarily solved the urgent problem of the knitted brow after struggling hard. However, after a long attack, they ran in vain, and their energy was insufficient. 花利亞 (Hualiya) took advantage of this gap, took one after another, shot in two goals, and snatched back a tie. At the end of the game, the score was tied 2-2.

After adding time to fight again, the Hong Kong Club generals were exhausted because they had worked hard to fight before, and their fighting spirit disappeared, so they were taken advantage of by the Police Club and controlled the overall situation. As a result, 黃文貴 (Huang Wengui) scored a goal and eliminated the Hong Kong Club with a score of 3-2. The lineup is as follows. (Gu Ben)

(Police Club)

埃健士 (Ai Jianshi)

陳光裕 (Chen Guangyu) 柏架 (Bai Jia)

挪夫 (Nuo Fu) 畢力頓 (Bilitun) 范貴才 (Fan Guicai)

江興 (Jiang Xing) 吳律 (Wu Lu) 磨 (Mo) 花利亞 (Hualiya) 黃文貴 (Huang Wengui)

(Hong Kong Club)

高路士 (Gao Lusi)

泰挪 (Tainuo) 昆脫 (Kuntuo)

米頓 (Mì Dùn) 士堅拿 (Shi Jianna) 哥云 (Geyun)

梳氏 (Shushi) 衣史杜 (Yi Shidu) 治 (Zhi) 早拉 (Zaola) 德北 (De Bei) 派路 (Pailu)

### Ms. Luo Qiao'er Marries on New Year's Day

Ms. Luo Qiao'er, who won the Guangzhou Women's Tennis Championship three times, married Mr. Liang Yunhao, a bachelor of engineering from National University, yesterday on New Year's Day. At 3:30 PM, a tea party was held on the second floor of the Datong Hotel to entertain guests. More than a hundred relatives and friends of the bride and groom, as well as celebrities from the sports and education circles, attended the event. Ms. Luo also graduated from the engineering department of National University and was a classmate of Mr. Liang. She is currently employed by the Hong Kong Refugee Industrial Society, while Mr. Liang is the founder and professor of the Hong Kong Tongji Engineering College. Both are known for their engineering achievements. Their marriage is also a good story in the engineering world.

### Movie

Entertainment… Golden Drums Rumble

Drums

A never-before-seen production from British Alexander Korda. The script tells the story of Prince Azim (Sabhu) seeking revenge for his father's murder. After Majula selflessly saves his life, Azim reports the secret of the "rebellion" to the governor when Prince Gore conspires to launch a major attack. He even helps by drumming, waiting for reinforcements to arrive and annihilate the rebellion.

There are two remarkable scenes in the performance. During the Saint's Day celebration, the palace is filled with jubilant celebrations, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for the uprising. This culminates in the start of the drumming. Following this, there is a climax where reinforcements arrive, and both sides engage in a fierce battle. With well-equipped facilities surpassing those abroad, capturing the scene vividly and naturally is an easy task. Several war scenes are very stimulating for the audience. The outdoor scenes are likely more beautiful because of the vibrant colors.

Regarding the actors, "Sabhu" displays his endearing performance skills from "Elephant Boy," and remains excellent here. The female lead, Valerie Hobson, is a beautiful and skilled British star. Regarding "If I Were King," directed by Frank Lloyd, his previous works such as "Cavalcade" and "Mutiny on the Bounty" were all outstanding and successful films that left audiences with an unforgettable good impression. Critics have said that his recent work, "If I Were King," is a further step forward in success compared to the aforementioned works in every aspect.

The story is set in Paris during the reign of Louis XI of France, a time when the country faces strong external enemies and internal starvation. The central figure is a poet and swordsman who is also a rogue. He is an outstanding leader among the rioting masses. He unintentionally kills an enemy of Louis, and Louis, impressed by his bold words, grants him full authority to manage the country for a week. Within this time, he must drive the strong enemy out of the country, or he will face severe punishment. Relying on his courage and talent, and after immense struggles and efforts, he ultimately defeats the strong enemy and wins the heart of the princess.

The entire film is performed with grandeur and splendor, and all the characters are lively and vibrant. Among the main actors, Basil Rathbone's portrayal of Louis is particularly praiseworthy.

### Resistance and Sports

— Li Hui

A few months ago, a leading figure in British athletics, Mr. Zeng Lianheng, issued a circular telegram to the people of the country, proclaiming the slogan "Expanding armaments is not as good as improving the national morality and spirit through sports." At that time, King George VI of England greatly praised this matter and made precise remarks on the radio, saying, "If every country can cultivate their minds and bodies through the proper path of sports, then from individuals, the social organization will be healthy, and various problems such as greed, cowardice, suspicion, selfishness, apathy, and cruelty can be eliminated, thereby making the country stronger and life never extinguished." Recently, Nazi Germany has also been practically promoting the "National Defense Sports" theory, establishing rules and vigorously implementing them, using sports to forge and promote the spirit of Greater Germany.

Undoubtedly, by today, everyone understands that the sports industry has an extraordinary relationship with human life and with society and the country. Sports are simply the heart of a person, which must be constantly beating and cannot stop for a moment. The greatest advantages of sports are:

(1) Strengthening the body

(2) Promoting the virtue of obedience

(3) Encouraging the spirit of unity. In addition to the above three major points, sports can: 1. Enhance national consciousness; 2. Cultivate patriotic enthusiasm; 3. Instill the spirit of sacrifice; 4. Cultivate noble character; 5. Foster a sense of justice and martial spirit. Therefore, in modern sports, if we want to measure the strength of a country, we can almost estimate the quality of its sports achievements as a reliable standard. Talking about sports today, when the country is in deep trouble and the national situation is critical, seems very out of place on the surface. Many people will say, "The sports industry is a long-term plan, and now the flames are already burning our eyebrows, how can we spare any space to take care of it?" True, in today's full-scale war of resistance, military strength, financial resources, and military supplies seem to be the most urgent needs. However, if we have the great determination to resist the war for a long time, then whether it is treating the symptoms or the root cause, whether it is urgent or slow, I believe that the sports industry should be given even more attention and should not be neglected for a moment. May I ask, if the country has no healthy organization, how can it resist to the end? On the individual side, if there is no strong physique, how can one take on the task of national salvation? A healthy organization and a strong physique can only be obtained with certainty by following the proper path of sports, and cannot be obtained by luck. Tolstoy said it well, "Only in physical labor can one obtain health and promote the mutual unity of mankind."

The author is a small part of the sports community. Since the start of the War of Resistance, I am ashamed to have no military, rescue, or other specialized skills. I have no trace of my presence on the front lines, and even in the rear, due to various circumstances, I am ashamed that I cannot do more to help the country and cannot do more work that is beneficial to the War of Resistance, which makes me extremely uneasy and ashamed. I think many sports comrades in the rear will have the same feeling, the same pain, and the same regret. As far as I know, because there are not many people in the sports community who have a fundamental relationship with the military, there have been very few who have sacrificed their lives for the country in this war. Most of the people in the sports community are young and strong, and it can be considered a great shame that they still cannot contribute more to the work of defending the country at this time of crisis. I feel ashamed. (To be continued)

### US Reiterates Far East Policy, Does Not Recognize Results of Aggression, Notifies Japan of Reserved Rights, British View Same as US

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] The new note from the United States to Japan states that, based on past facts and experience, the United States government must reiterate the following views: that Japan's restrictions on the actions of American nationals in China place Japanese interests in a superior position, and that the legitimate interests of the United States will inevitably be discriminated against. The note mentions Japan's foreign exchange controls in China, forced currency circulation, tariff revisions, and controlled business operations, stating that these restrictive measures are extremely unfair and violate treaty provisions. The United States government and its people will never agree to any system established by a third country in China that deprives it of its long-established rights and the fundamental principles of equal opportunity and fair treatment. Principles such as equal opportunity cannot be abolished by unilateral actions. The note also firmly rejects Japan's so-called "New Order in East Asia," stating that the United States reserves all its rights in China. Finally, the note declares that the United States is prepared to discuss amendments to treaties concerning China, but solemnly declares that the United States will not allow Japan to undermine the principles of the Open Door and equal opportunity. Authoritative sources claim that this will be the final note from the United States on the China issue.

[Reuters, London, November 31st] A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that the recent note from the United States to Japan has attracted significant attention in London. Regarding the issue of British interests in China, British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has held informal discussions with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. It is expected that Britain will not issue a note to Japan for the time being. Officials have not yet made any comments on the US note to Japan. However, observers believe that the approach adopted by Washington and the views expressed in the US note to Japan are in line with London's views and feelings.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] Regarding maintaining the Open Door policy in China, US Ambassador to Japan, Joseph Grew, recently submitted a note to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. (Note: After the United States submitted a note to Japan on October 6th, Japan submitted a reply on November 18th, and this note from the United States is in response to Japan's reply.) The content briefly states that the actions and activities of American citizens in China have been restricted by the Japanese authorities, and that the advantages enjoyed by Japan have already placed it in a superior position. This discriminatory approach is unfair. It should be known that the legal position of the various countries concerned is stipulated in treaties. If Japan wishes to amend them, it can achieve its goal through international negotiations and normal procedures. However, Japan claims that it has the right to violate treaties based on a new order and a new situation, which is unacceptable to the US government. The new reality in China is caused by Japan. The conclusion is that if Japan can propose other suggestions to the other countries concerned, including China, the US and Chinese governments are prepared to discuss them. The venue should be jointly designated by the various countries concerned, and from this moment until that time, the US government should reserve all existing rights and not allow them to be changed. The most important point is that the legal position of the various countries in China can be revised based on the suggestions made by Japan. US diplomatic sources recently commented that this is an indirect proposal to convene an international conference. It is intended to remind Japan that the country participated in negotiations during the difficult situation in 1922, and the Nine-Power Treaty was born as a result. To this day, this procedure still needs to be adopted. However, according to the information received here, Japan is unwilling to hold an international conference. This note from the United States is not so much a new initiation for the Far East issue as it is a reiteration of the main principles.

[Central News Agency, Yangon, 1st] US Ambassador to China, Nelson Johnson, arrived here yesterday and is scheduled to fly to London today.

### Chamberlain and Others to Rome, Will Not Discuss French-Italian Issues, Visit Schedule Published, Meeting with Mussolini on the 11th

[Reuters, Rome, 1st] Local officials have published the schedule for the visit of British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax to Italy. The British Prime Minister and his entourage will arrive on the 11th and reside at the Villa Madama during their stay. They will first go to the Italian Royal Palace to sign the guest book there, and then visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Venice and attend the banquet held there that evening. On the 12th, they will present a wreath at the Italian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and at noon, they will have lunch with the Italian King at the Royal Palace. In the afternoon, they will visit a gymnastics performance and in the evening, they will go to the theater and have dinner with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. On the 13th, they will visit the Vatican and have lunch with the British envoy to the Vatican. In the afternoon, they will visit the mineral exhibition and attend the reception at the Governor's Palace of Rome. On the evening of the same day, a banquet will be held at the British Embassy, and they will depart from Rome on the 14th at noon to return to Britain.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 1st] The British side has provided assurances to the French government, stating that Prime Minister Chamberlain will refuse to discuss French-Italian issues and Mediterranean issues with the Italian side during his visit to Italy, and will only focus on the Spanish issue as the theme of the talks. Therefore, France's attitude is even more rigid, which can be seen in the comments of various parties. "Order" newspaper claims that France should learn a lesson from the recent experience and not be fooled again.

### French Premier Tours North Africa, Arrived in Toulon the Night Before, Transferred to Corsica, Meets with Naval Chief and Continues to Tunis

[Reuters, Paris, 1st] French Prime Minister Daladier took a train to Toulon today, marking the start of his tour of the Mediterranean colonies. His itinerary includes Corsica and Tunisia.

[Haitong News Agency, Toulon, 1st] French Prime Minister Daladier arrived here at 1:20 last night from Marseille on a special train. Military and political dignitaries and a large crowd of people stood at the station to greet him despite the late-night wind and cold. At midnight, the Prime Minister transferred to the cruiser Foch and went to Ajaccio on the west coast of Corsica. This is the birthplace of Napoleon, and then he will transfer to the military port of Bastia on the island to meet with the French Minister of the Navy. It is expected to arrive at 2:30 in the afternoon and continue to Tunis, North Africa, and arrive at the highest military port of Bizerte at 6:00.

[Haitong News, Paris] On Sunday morning, the French parliament passed the third reading of the 1939 budget by a vote of 372 to 209. French Prime Minister Daladier's delay in his tour of the North African colonies was only because he was waiting for the decision to be made. Before Daladier departed from Marseille, he had a long talk with Foreign Minister Bonnet at the station.

### German and Italian Aircraft Six Times More Than British and French, Statistics from US Army Experts

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] According to statistics from experts at the US Army Department, at the time of the signing of the Munich Agreement, Germany and Italy had six times more aircraft than Britain and France. The experts said that Germany manufactured more than 1,000 aircraft in November of last year, while Britain could only manufacture 240 aircraft per month. Although the rate of manufacturing has now increased by two times, it is still only half of Germany's. The United States can manufacture an average of 350 aircraft per month, while the number of aircraft in France is far less than that in Italy. Germany's aircraft industry has 400,000 skilled workers, while the United States has 36,000.

### British Queen Catches Cold

[Reuters, London, 1st] It is learned that the Queen has a slight cold and is staying in Sandringham House to recuperate.

### Skoda Armaments Factory Not Bought by Germans

[Reuters, Prague, 31st] It was previously reported that the Czechoslovakian Skoda armaments factory was purchased by the Krupp artillery factory, which is controlled by the German government. Reuters has now confirmed that this is not the case.

### German-Soviet Trade Relations Weak

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 1st] Economic relations between Germany and the Soviet Union were at a low point last year. In January, German goods exported to the Soviet Union were worth only 21 million marks, and Soviet goods imported into Germany were worth about 35 million marks. In the previous year, from January to December, German goods exported to the Soviet Union were worth a total of 117 million marks, and Soviet goods imported into Germany were worth 65 million marks. A comparison shows the extent of the decline.

### German Newspapers Discuss New Year Prospects, Will Raise Colonial Demands, Still Attack US

[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] At midnight on New Year's Eve, Hitler, wearing a hat, stood in front of the door of his country villa and fired salutes as a New Year's start. Prior to this, villagers wearing Bavarian folk costumes sang the national anthem and dragged a small cannon up the mountain to fire it on time. Hitler shook hands with everyone and offered New Year's greetings. The "Berlin Local Newspaper" generally discussed Germany's New Year prospects, saying, "We still do not know what will happen this year, but we will still have demands, such as colonies." Also, the "German Times" stated, "The crime of the United States is not only that it is unfriendly to Germany, but also that it attacks Europe's national awakening."

### Soviet Automobile Expert Zegerlu Murdered

[Haitong News Agency, Moscow, 2nd] Zegerlu, a famous Soviet automobile builder, was murdered in his private residence. According to police, Zegerlu had been living in seclusion for a long time, researching new types of automobiles. Several suspects have been arrested.

### German Aircraft Makes Long-Distance Flight to Australia

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 2nd] The German light aircraft Alana 79 is making a long-distance flight to Australia. Yesterday, it flew continuously for 12 hours without stopping, directly to Bangkok, Siam.

### Crookshank Flies Back to London to Compile Berlin Talks Report, German Submarine Construction Plans Unchanged

[Reuters, London, 1st] The British Foreign Office issued a statement on Germany's announcement of its decision to build submarines of the same tonnage as Britain, stating, "Representatives of the British and German navies held a meeting at the German Ministry of the Navy on December 30 to express their opinions on the matter. The atmosphere of the talks was extremely friendly." A Reuters reporter stated that after the Berlin talks, there was no official news regarding Germany's decision, but there seems to be no reason to speculate that Germany has changed its intention to build submarines of the same tonnage as Britain. Rear Admiral Crookshank, head of the British delegation, has now flown back to London to prepare a report to be submitted to the Foreign Office, Prime Minister Chamberlain, and Foreign Secretary Halifax. Both of them are currently on vacation in Yorkshire. A naval correspondent for the "Sunday Times" discussed the Berlin negotiations, stating, "Germany can have more than twice as many small submarines as Britain in terms of quantity. Germany currently has more submarines than Britain. The ratio of submarines between the two countries is 69 to 72, but the tonnage of German submarines is only 45 percent of Britain's, because most German submarines are small, while British submarines are equipped to travel anywhere in the world and are mostly large. This does not mean that German submarines are purely coastal vessels."

French Newspaper Observations

[Reuters, Paris, 1st] The newspapers here are criticizing Germany's demand to build submarines of the same tonnage as Britain. The general opinion is that Germany intends to aid Italy, because submarines can enter the Mediterranean Sea more easily than surface ships. Moreover, submarines can be used to break future blockades and hinder British shipping. "Le Figaro" newspaper stated, "Germany is now building a large number of small submarines, which can be hidden in the North Sea and the English Channel, while its naval power is currently building large submarines." The general opinion of the newspapers is that this move by Germany will cause Britain to feel that its maritime hegemony is in danger and threatened. "Industrial News" stated, "The result of this move by Germany will inevitably make Britain even more opposed to authoritarianism. This is not appropriate for Italy, because Italy is now hoping to use British Prime Minister Chamberlain's visit to Italy to obtain concessions from France."

### Germany and Italy to Discuss Economic Cooperation, German Economy Minister Funk to Arrive in Rome on the 7th in Response to Invitation

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 2nd] German Economy Minister Funk is currently vacationing in Sicily, southern Italy. It is reported that on his way back to Germany, he will make an official visit to Rome. According to the Italian National Daily, Funk's visit to the Italian capital is to reciprocate the invitation from Italian Minister of Corporations Lantini to Germany. Funk is expected to arrive in Rome on the 7th of this month and stay for three days on official business. It is reported that the future talks in the Italian capital will be about various issues of economic cooperation between Germany and Italy.

### US Silver Purchase Price Will Not Change This Year

[Reuters, Washington, December 31st] US President Roosevelt announced today that the price at which the US Treasury Department purchases newly produced domestic silver in 1939 will not change. He also announced that the country's silver purchase program would be extended to the 1939 fiscal year, so the price of newly produced silver will remain at 64.64 pence per ounce. The president also stipulated that newly produced silver must be delivered to the mint by the end of June. If Congress does not reauthorize it by then, the president's power to set the silver price by proclamation will cease. Members of Congress from silver-producing states have asked the president not to lower the price of silver, saying that this would cause miners to lose their jobs.

### US Army Department Purchases Special Machines, Preparing to Equip Shells and Make Gunpowder

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] US Army Chief of Ordnance Major General Wesson published an article in the "Army Ordnance," stating that the US Army Department has decided to allocate $33.5 million to purchase special machines. These machines will be located in newly built munitions factories in the interior of the country, and will be used to equip shells and make gunpowder in times of emergency.

### German Issues Decree, Specifying Deadline for Raw Material Distribution

[Reuters, Berlin, December 31st] The German Official Gazette published several decrees, specifying the deadline for the distribution of various raw materials, from December to the 15th of the month. These raw materials include various metals, sesame, hemp, and tires. Typewriters, radios, automobiles, and other industries are all affected by this new decree.

### Spanish Rebel Aircraft Fiercely Attack Barcelona, Valencia Also Suffers Heavy Bombing

[Reuters, Barcelona, 1st] The Spanish government officially received French Ambassador Henry today. Coincidentally, rebel aircraft came to bomb, so the French Ambassador was escorted by government guards to a safe place amidst the sound of aircraft and anti-aircraft guns. All the ceremonies proceeded as usual and were not hindered. It was found that the air raid killed five people and injured nine.

[Reuters, Valencia, 31st] The ship "Milu Panu" was bombed by rebel aircraft, avoiding serious losses. This was the third dangerous incident encountered by the ship this week. At that time, rebel aircraft carried out fierce bombing, dropping more than 50 bombs. Fragments of bamboo bombs fell on the superstructure of the "Milu Panu." At the same time, according to reports from Barcelona, 30 people were killed and 80 injured in the bombing here today.

### Anxious About War, Soviet Newspaper Comments on Konoe Declaration, Clumsy Methods Not Enough to Deceive People

[Reuters, Moscow, February 31st] Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's declaration on December 22 regarding the principles of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations has aroused fierce criticism from the "Izvestia" newspaper here. The newspaper infers two points from this: 1. Japan's purpose is to completely conquer China; 2. Japanese military leaders are no longer anxious about the outcome of the war. Because Japan is anxious about the outcome of the war, it wants to try to negotiate with the pro-Japanese elements in China. The declaration also targets foreign forces (the purpose of Japan's operation is to target foreign interests). But in this regard, the declaration is also a clumsy method, because it is not enough to deceive anyone. As for Japan's preparation to abolish extraterritoriality, it indicates its intention to completely control China.

Small Commentary

### On Construction Projects in the War of Resistance and Nation-Building

— Chen Cheng

This article is based on my speech to the cadre training corps students on the front lines of Biaoyang on October 17th last year. The intention was to explain that the War of Resistance is a means, and nation-building is the goal. Therefore, the current war is merely a means to achieve the goal of national revolution and nation-building. In order to win the war, we must strengthen our resistance efforts, and while fighting, we must also engage in construction, especially active national assistance construction, so that we can complete the arduous work of the War of Resistance as soon as possible. Now, as the new year begins, and a new page in the history of national rejuvenation is unfolded, it is time for us to encourage self-reflection, intensify mobilization, and strive for construction in the rear. As the saying goes, "The plan for the year lies in the spring." Therefore, I am raising the issue of construction as a New Year's message, hoping to provide a reference for the people of the country to devote themselves to construction in the future, so that construction and revolutionary affairs can be coordinated, and the War of Resistance and nation-building can proceed simultaneously. Then, the great cause of a new China based on the Three Principles of the People can be achieved and witnessed!

Introduction

(1) The Meaning of Construction. (2) The Content of Construction. (3) The People's Livelihood Problem and People's Livelihood Construction. (4) Production Construction and National Defense Construction. (5) Unified Control and Management of Construction. (6) Construction and Education.

Introduction

During our arduous War of Resistance, many people have been asking about construction, and everyone is paying attention to this issue, which is a good phenomenon. However, many disputes have arisen in their discussions, with each side insisting on their own views and no consensus being reached. This situation directly and indirectly reduces the strength of construction and affects the future of the War of Resistance. Therefore, today I am putting forward my personal views on this issue for everyone to study.

In my opinion, most of the disputes that everyone has generated are due to errors in research principles. Therefore, before entering the main topic, I must first talk about the basic principles of studying social problems:

Society is developing forward without hesitation. The relationships between people in society are becoming closer day by day. These interconnected relationships constitute the social whole. Therefore, the entire society is directly and indirectly linked to each other. For example, the Sino-Japanese War can directly affect the economies and financial markets of various countries in the world, and indirectly affect local prices, and even affect the daily lives of individuals. This is like throwing a stone into a pond; its ripples can gradually spread to the entire surface of the water. Although the size of the ripples varies depending on the distance, it is impossible to be unaffected. What is the reason for this? It is because the surface of the water is a whole, and every molecule of water is connected to each other. Society is even more so; therefore, when studying any social problem, we cannot forget the relationships between all aspects. A one-sided, partial, and isolated study will not easily lead to correct conclusions. For example, in the case of the army, only when senior officers, middle-ranking officers, junior soldiers, and even weapons and equipment have appropriate and sound organizational coordination can they exert great combat effectiveness. Any deficiency in any part is enough to affect combat power. In this War of Resistance, most people know the importance of senior generals, but are soldiers not in an equally important position? It's just that they each have different duties, like the five senses and four limbs of the human body, none of which can be missing. If you understand this principle, then those who sell chili peppers don't have to say that vinegar is also spicy; and those who sell vinegar don't have to insist that chili peppers are also sour.

Secondly, it is important to know that society is continuously developing. Society has never died, and therefore its development has never been interrupted. The history of the development of this entire human society constitutes extremely complex causal relationships—as if without yesterday, there would be no today, and with today, there must be a tomorrow. Today's capitalist society was born from the womb of feudal society. At the same time, due to the many contradictions within today's capitalist society, a utopian society will inevitably emerge in the future. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen's idea of a world commonwealth does not come from nowhere, but is produced based on the historical evolution and objective reality. To be clearer, it was because of the backwardness of Chinese society that the active aggression of Japanese imperialism was triggered, which created the current great War of Resistance. Furthermore, it is because of the concerted efforts of the entire country that the powerful factors for final victory and national liberation have been formed. From this, of course, we can further seek why Chinese society has fallen behind and why Japanese imperialism must expand outward. Although these questions take a long time to explain, this method and principle are indeed the only way to solve the problem. The so-called "things have roots and branches" is this principle. If we sever the past and future in our research, without searching for its source and future development, the result will only be knowing one thing but not knowing the other?

(1) The Meaning of Construction

In the process of human social evolution, it often contains two opposing components. Some people represent the interests of the whole society and help society develop forward; some people, for personal interests, do not hesitate to harm the interests of the whole and hinder the development of society, even pulling society backward. The meaning of revolution is to promote society to progress forward in order to seek the happiness and well-being of all mankind. That is to say, to move towards a rational society. In order to achieve this goal, revolution must adopt two necessary methods. On the one hand, the reactionary forces and facilities that hinder social progress must be destroyed as much as possible in order to create favorable conditions for construction and ensure the rapid development of the revolution. On the other hand, the various requirements of the new society must be actively built in order to consolidate the true foundation of the revolution, to thoroughly destroy the revolutionary reactionary forces, and to achieve the true purpose of the revolution. Therefore, construction and destruction are in an equally important position in the revolutionary sense, but most people pay attention to destruction and often ignore construction, which is a great mistake. We can also see that in the "Declaration of the Outline of National Construction" thirteen years ago, it was stated that "The Outline of National Construction begins with clearing obstacles and ends with completing construction. Revolution is an extraordinary destruction, so there must be extraordinary construction to follow it." This has long designated the importance of construction in the revolution. In order to promote the progress of Chinese society, Sun Yat-sen led the revolution with great spirit, and carried out more than ten fierce struggles against the corrupt and unsustainable Manchu Qing regime and autocratic political system, and finally achieved the success of the Xinhai Revolution. Since the Republic of China, he has fought decisively against the Northern Warlords, who were the remnants of feudalism. All his efforts were nothing more than using revolutionary forces to clear the obstacles to construction in order to bring about a new society as soon as possible. He personally drafted important plans such as the "Outline of National Construction," which was evidence of his desire to build a new China. Sun Yat-sen said: "In the future, the revolution should continue the unfinished cause of the Xinhai Revolution, and vigorously correct its mistakes. That is, in the future, the revolution should not only focus on destruction, but also on construction." This shows his attention to construction. The leader, following Sun Yat-sen's legacy, leads the revolution, creating a unified situation unique in history, and striving for various construction works. Recently, he launched the nation's human and material resources into a life-and-death battle with Japanese imperialism, which is hindering our nation's independence and ethnic survival. However, after the July 7th Incident, he put forward the slogan of "National Construction Movement" at Mount Lu, pointing out the path to national construction. The declaration of the Provisional National Congress also stated: "We should do our utmost to strive for the survival and independence of the nation and the country, and at the same time, based on the Three Principles of the People, continue to complete the political and economic construction, so that China can enjoy freedom and equality in the world." It also stated: "If there is no War of Resistance, the survival and independence of the nation cannot be guaranteed, and there will be no way to carry out the great cause of nation-building. And without nation-building, self-reliance cannot be sufficient, and how can we defend against foreign aggression and seek final victory." Therefore, today's War of Resistance means resisting aggression and removing obstacles to building a new China, which is completely the same meaning as overthrowing the Manchu Qing, overthrowing the warlords, and eliminating feudal remnants in the past.

Secondly, reactionary forces often use the excuse of construction to paralyze the people and achieve their goal of destroying the revolution. From the restoration of Zhang Xun and Yuan Shikai's claim to the throne in the distant past, to the Japanese invaders' creation of puppet regimes in the near past, they are all like this. We must know that construction must stand under the banner of revolution to have progressive significance. Counter-revolutionary construction is nothing more than creating a reactionary situation and making society forever remain in an unreasonable state. The Japanese invaders' construction of puppet regimes is to make our country forever fall into a colony, and to make us live a life of slavery like cattle and horses. And our construction is precisely to build a new society on the other side of this sea of suffering, to make China an independent, free, and happy country. Everyone only needs to pay attention to this point, and they will not be able to tell right from wrong and go astray.

(2) The Content of Construction

Building a new China based on the Three Principles of the People is our overall goal of revolution. In more detail, our construction must move in the direction of national independence, equality of civil rights, and people's livelihood and happiness, so as to achieve China's equal international status, equal political status, and equal economic status, so that China can permanently survive in the world. In order to achieve these goals, Sun Yat-sen divided the nature of construction into three departments in the "Fundamentals of National Reconstruction": psychological construction, material construction, and social construction. The leader further carried forward Sun Yat-sen's legacy, and summarized Sun Yat-sen's legacy on government organization and local autonomy into political construction, and supplemented military construction as military construction, completing the five major departments of construction.

1. Psychological construction refers to Sun Yat-sen's philosophy. The essence contained in it is to vigorously refute the absurd theory of "knowing is easy, doing is difficult" that has existed for thousands of years, because the influence of this theory has made the people of the whole country, and even revolutionary comrades, fall into a state of "difficulty in acting" and unable to believe in words and deeds. The revolutionary spirit is completely lost. The consequences of this malpractice are truly as Sun Yat-sen said, a hundred times more than the Manchu Qing. The change of this decadent psychology is equivalent to the injection of the revolutionary soul. With this revolutionary soul, any powerful reactionary force will not shake our revolutionary spirit in the slightest. The leader expanded its scope, promoted the spirit of "wisdom, benevolence, and courage," and completed the actual spiritual construction, inspiring loyalty, promoting righteousness, and saving the country from danger and restoring the nation.

2. Material construction refers to Sun Yat-sen's "Industrial Plan." The "Industrial Plan" is the most magnificent part of Sun Yat-sen's construction. The real social development is the greater conquest of nature by mankind and the full utilization of materials. China is vast and rich in resources, and its natural resources are particularly abundant. The reason why it is behind others is that it has not been explored and utilized, and the goods are abandoned on the ground, which is truly regrettable. If we can implement Sun Yat-sen's "Industrial Plan," then the economy will develop, the people's livelihood will be prosperous, and the problems of food, clothing, housing, and transportation will be easily solved, and of course, it can become a rich, strong, and peaceful new country. What should be paid more attention to is what the leader said, "The 'Industrial Plan' is actually a great national defense plan." Sun Yat-sen had deep foresight and planned for the long-term peace and stability of the country and the nation. Unfortunately, we did not earnestly follow it, giving the Japanese invaders the opportunity to invade violently. Looking back, it is truly heartbreaking!

3. Social construction refers to the "Elementary Principles of Civil Rights." On the surface, it is nothing more than explaining the form and order of meetings. In fact, it contains two special meanings: 1. "Cultivating the organizational ability of the people." We know the greatness of mechanical power because it is based on a certain organization and cooperation. If each part is disassembled, it is just some fragments of steel. Everything is like this, let alone human beings. We call ourselves numerous in population, but if we don't add a certain organization, it will be like the past when we faced the enemy as a disorganized mass. Even if there are several times more of us, I'm afraid it won't have any effect. If every citizen is accustomed to Sun Yat-sen's "Elementary Principles of Civil Rights," develops a habit of organization, and mobilizes the people of the whole country, uniting 400 million people as one, it can be said that everything has a solution. 2. Cultivate the people's ability to use political power. The ultimate goal of the Principle of Democracy is to enable the people to manage politics and realize a truly democratic country, but if the people do not have the ability to manage, they are often used by a few people to seek personal gain, and the harm is even more unimaginable. Sun Yat-sen not only wanted to return political power to the people, but also taught the people how to use political power, which can be said to be the ultimate in benevolence and righteousness.

4. Political construction, as explained by the leader, refers to "actual things within the scope of ordinary politics, especially the construction and operation of national political institutions." This means improving political institutions and making the people's self-defense organizations sound. At present, it means improving people's lives and mobilizing all forces with the military as the center to consolidate our political foundation in the War of Resistance. Especially for the lazy, faint-hearted, greedy, and corrupt officials, they must be thoroughly eradicated. Speaking of the Five-Power Constitution, it is, as the leader said, "the ideal system to be built by political construction," which is also the ultimate goal of political construction.

5. Military construction is military construction, which is to develop military strength and create national defense forces to eliminate obstacles internally and maintain the independence and equality of the country and the nation externally. Therefore, the military force mentioned here is a revolutionary military force, which is to take on revolutionary undertakings, and is not used as a private tool as in the warlord era. As I have said, the main purpose of building an army is to transform the military force of individuals and groups into the military force of the country and the nation, to transform weak military forces into strong military forces, and to transform a small number of military forces into a large number of military forces, uniting them into one. Under the unified leadership of the leader, we sacrifice for the War of Resistance and for the cause. With sufficient military construction, all practical construction will be effectively guaranteed. Especially in today's national arms race, where the weak are prey to the strong, military construction is even more urgent and important.

The reason why we have elaborated on the five departments of construction here is to make everyone aware of the wholeness of construction and not to ignore one aspect at will, becoming a deformed construction. Because people often only invite one principle of democracy, losing the original meaning of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, but at the same time, they ignore the special importance of the Principle of People's Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People, which is a great danger. Below we will go on to explain this point.

(3) The People's Livelihood Problem and People's Livelihood Construction

"The primary task of construction is the people's livelihood." This is an important instruction that Sun Yat-sen left us—the leader explained the importance of people's livelihood construction in the Three Principles of the People, saying: "The Principle of Nationalism is to support the independence of the country and the nation, which is to eliminate the obstacles to the people's livelihood. The Principle of Democracy is to build the power of the people, which is to enable the people themselves to solve the problem of the people's livelihood." According to Sun Yat-sen's meaning, "People's livelihood is the people's life, the survival of society, the people's livelihood (which can also be said to be the country's livelihood), and the life of the masses (nation)." What is most important is the people's life. As everyone can understand from the name, as long as the people's life is properly solved, then the society's survival, the country's livelihood, and the life of the masses will naturally be solved easily. The occurrence of all problems in society and the most difficult problems to solve in human history are the root cause of all problems in the people's livelihood problem, which is also the only reason why Sun Yat-sen extremely valued it and listed it as the central problem of the Three Principles of the People. We must follow Sun Yat-sen's will and build a new society based on the Three Principles of the People, and we have to devote ourselves to the construction of the people's livelihood. At the same time, all construction is based on the construction of the people's livelihood as the main basis.

All human economic activities are nothing more than the four major needs of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. These four major practical life problems constitute the main content of the people's livelihood problems. The source of fulfilling these practical needs, of course, exists in the natural world. Therefore, human beings are constantly seeking to conquer and utilize nature in order to meet their living requirements. The meaning of a backward society is that everything is backward, but the main thing is that its production is backward, that is, its power to conquer and utilize nature is relatively weak, so its practical life requirements cannot be better satisfied. Logically speaking, the more developed the production and the more prosperous the society, the more human practical life can be better satisfied, so human beings do not have to study other problems, just strive to develop production. But in reality, this is not the case, because the social system makes the means of production, capital, and production tools concentrated in the hands of a few people, who do not engage in labor, but specialize in exploiting the surplus value of others and living a luxurious life. At the same time, the majority of people who work hard every day cannot maintain the minimum standard of living, forming a huge contradiction in society. This kind of social development is only beneficial to a few people, forming an unreasonable situation of those who work having no food and those who do not work having food, directly affecting the development of production. Sun Yat-sen recognized that Chinese society is a backward society in production. If we want the people to live comfortably, we must work hard to promote production construction. At the same time, he saw clearly the malpractices of social development in advanced countries and came up with a reasonable solution: 1. Implement equal land ownership to eliminate the phenomenon of annexation and encroachment by the elite in society and achieve the goal of farmers owning their land; 2. Restrain capital, advocate protecting private enterprises on the one hand to seek rapid development of production, and at the same time restrict private capital so that it does not manipulate the people's livelihood to endanger the lives of the majority of people; 3. Promote labor-capital cooperation, eliminate the problems that hinder production due to labor-capital conflicts, and make both parties cooperate under the highest interests of the country and the nation to accelerate production; 4. Develop state capital, so that all enterprises that are not suitable for private operation or that private individuals cannot operate should be operated by the state, and the operating rights of the central government and local governments should also be divided according to certain standards; 5. The government and the people should cooperate to solve the problems of production and distribution, so that the social economy has a certain track and order. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen's greatness lies not only in striving for construction to solve the people's livelihood problems, but also in paying attention to the improvement of the social system so that it does not hinder production construction, not only paying attention to production problems, but also paying attention to distribution problems, not only knowing the general contradictory phenomena in advanced countries, but also paying attention to the special backwardness of Chinese society, not only caring about the current problems, but also paying attention to preventing future malpractices. The leader further advocated the National Economic Construction Movement based on Sun Yat-sen's basic principles as an initial realization of the construction of the people's livelihood, in order to achieve the great goal of making the best use of people's talents, making the best use of land, making the best use of things, and making the best use of everything, and then to complete the highest ideal of a world commonwealth.

(4) Peaceful Construction and National Defense Construction

Society cannot have a major death or interruption, and production cannot be stopped or interrupted for a single day. The meaning of production construction is that all construction related to the people's lives and promoting the interests of the people's lives can be included. Therefore, it is more broadly referred to as economic construction by the general public. Sun Yat-sen's production construction is mostly contained in the construction of the people's livelihood, so understanding Sun Yat-sen's construction of the people's livelihood will allow a general understanding of the direction of China's production construction. What we should especially mention here is national defense construction. Although national defense construction and military construction are closely related, they are not the same. The former's scope is obviously much larger than the latter. All construction related to the existence and independence of the country and the nation can be called national defense construction, and is not limited to military construction alone. However, military construction is indeed the most essential and necessary construction in national defense construction. The leader believes that military force is one of the lives of the country, and we can know its importance. Speaking of national defense construction, Sun Yat-sen noticed this problem a long time ago. For example, the "Industrial Plan" implies a great significance of national defense planning, such as the opening up of rivers and seaports, the construction of railway networks, and the construction of coal, iron, mines, steelmaking machinery, and other ordnance factories, all of which are centered on the needs of national defense. The leader said to the training of military personnel: "If we don't thoroughly study the 'Industrial Plan,' we can't be considered to understand military affairs, and we are not qualified to talk about national defense." Unfortunately, for more than ten years, we have been limited by special circumstances, and the people of the country have not paid much attention, focusing only on the construction of the people's livelihood, and regarding the construction of the people's livelihood as ordinary economic construction, ignoring the importance of the military industry, emphasizing light industry over heavy industry, so that the manufacture of military supplies such as power and chemistry, and even the supplies and materials for wartime vehicles, cannot meet the requirements of self-sufficiency. If we can understand the importance of the existence of the country, we will know the importance of national defense construction even more. In a society where international boundaries still exist, especially today when the great powers are watching with covetous eyes, the importance of national defense construction really exceeds that of general production construction. Without national defense, there is no country. Without a country, what is there to talk about production construction! To be honest, the reason why we are suffering from the unreasonable devastation of tyranny today is because we had no national defense construction in the past. For example, many factories are built in large ports along the rivers and seas. In this war situation, the coastal areas have long become war zones, and our factories and industries have suffered great losses. A certain expert in national defense economics from Germany, after inspecting China, once told me that China's transportation construction is built from the outside to the inside, and many control points and transportation centers completely facilitate the enemy's invasion of us. These words make a lot of sense, which can prove that our past construction not only did not involve national defense construction, but was harmful to national defense. If we had paid attention to this, not only would these losses not have occurred, but our current weapons would also be enriched a hundredfold. We are by no means not paying attention to general production construction, but at this stage, we should focus on national defense construction. Only with the success of national defense construction can we achieve the national revolution's task of seeking freedom and equality for the country and the nation and guarantee the smooth development of production construction. Now, we have personally experienced the actual lessons. If we still stick to the old tune of general production construction without change, we are really ignorant of the priorities.

Furthermore, regarding the mutual relationship between national defense construction and various production departments, I have said that society is a whole, so production is not carried out in isolation. The so-called national defense construction means that it is centered on national defense, and does not mean that it ignores all other construction. Various production departments related to national defense construction must also be established to achieve the goal of everything for national defense. For example, military-related production is mostly heavy industry, but its main raw materials are coal and iron, so it is also related to the development of the mining industry. The manufacture of gunpowder requires cotton, and as a result, it is also involved in the scope of agricultural production. For these, if they are not carried out simultaneously, national defense construction will still not succeed.

(5) Unified System and Management of Construction

In today's capitalist socialist society, production relations have already turned the whole world into one. The production and construction of various countries are striving for unification in order to improve their production efficiency. The production methods of the feudal era are no longer applicable today. In the past, some provinces could not follow the unified national methods to promote construction, and instead formed independent systems, each building their own way, advocating local products of the province and resisting national goods from other provinces, which reduced the scope of circulation of national goods and fundamentally violated Sun Yat-sen's principle of smooth flow of goods, and implemented a provincial relationship doctrine, failing to see the overall connection of production. For example, on a national scale, due to the convenience of natural terrain and artificial raw materials, some places are suitable for the construction of heavy industry, while others are suitable for the construction of light industry due to special circumstances. The country needs a particularly large amount of certain physical objects and must produce them in large quantities. The production of certain goods must be limited to a certain quantity. This way, the country can be appropriately allocated for construction, and statistics can be made on the production quantity and raw material distribution of the whole country, so that each production department can have a certain connection and appropriate development, without a sense of excess or deficiency, to promote the national construction cause. This result of large-scale division of labor and cooperation across the country will surely achieve unexpected success. But this requires a unified national situation and a complete planning system to achieve this goal. It is important to know that each local area building behind closed doors is the most uneconomical thing, because if all provinces in the country implement their own construction, it will form twenty or so construction units, resulting in the production of things that are not suitable for production, and the smooth flow of things that are suitable for production cannot be carried out. Many efforts and materials are mutually offset, so how can there not be a reason for failure?

Unified control and management are connected things. Only after unification can we talk about control and management. What is commonly referred to as control mostly refers to the management power of the national government. Controlling production and construction means having a certain plan and certain steps for production and construction, opposing blind production and construction, and making production and construction proceed reasonably under a predetermined purpose, so as not to have the slightest waste or consumption. From this, we can see that the only premise of control is unification. After unification, we must immediately implement control so that the national construction cause can proceed very economically. For example, in the industrial circles of various countries, whether it is machinery or even screws, they are all unified throughout the country. As long as they are screws of the same number and size, whether it is a machine or a cannon, they can be used, which invisibly increases many conveniences. Some factories that usually manufacture toys can immediately be converted into factories that manufacture military supplies in times of war. These are all the results of following a certain profound plan during construction. It is the same intention as Sun Yat-sen's idea of embedding national defense construction in the industrial plan. Today, when resisting tyranny and striving to implement national defense construction, we should implement control and carry out construction according to a certain plan.

The meaning of management generally refers to the management of the factory itself, with the intention of reducing waste, reducing production costs, and increasing the production efficiency of manufactured products. The European Tailor provided scientific management, which made factory production proceed under the principle of special economy, so the industrial circles of various countries followed suit and are still striving for precise management. It is said that Japan's largest Yawata Steel Plant, in order to calculate how much toilet paper is needed every day, the factory authorities even specially sent commissioners to sit in the toilet to investigate the number of people in order to ensure an appropriate supply. I used to visit the construction of Shanxi, and I had detailed inquiries about various departments. As a result, I found that the biggest weakness was that they could not implement precise scientific management, use labor and raw materials in the most economical way, so that production costs could not be reduced to the minimum, so that prices were more expensive and could not defeat others in the market. The leader paid special attention to the word "management" in the national construction movement, believing that in order to achieve the goal of "no waste of time, no wasteland, no waste of materials" in the future, strict management must be implemented. Now we are building the country in difficult and difficult times, and we should pay special attention to management.

Six Construction and Education

What we have just said is to take national defense construction as the center and promote all construction undertakings in order to achieve the great goal of the entire country. However, the main driving force for this construction still exists in education. The leader believes that education is one of the three major lives of the country, which shows its importance to all undertakings. What we are talking about now is only the educational matters that are directly related to construction and must be done.

The current education should first pay attention to the cultivation of construction personnel. Everyone knows that construction is the greatest work, and it is not something that can be done by a certain person or a certain group of people alone. We must use the strength of everyone in the country and carry it out jointly under the principle of division of labor and cooperation. That is, we must use the total national mobilization to promote the intention of construction. Dunxiu explained in the summary of the National Economic Construction All-People Movement that "we must unite the sincerity of the people across the country, unite the full strength of farmers, workers, merchants, students, and soldiers, and work towards the same goal with a spirit of no distinction between each other and methods of division of labor and cooperation." Therefore, we must use the inherent spirit of "wisdom, faith, benevolence, and courage" and the power of educational propaganda to make the people of the whole country understand that construction is in the same important position in the country and the nation as the War of Resistance. His relationship with each individual's interests is very close; his future is bright and great. The special significance of national defense construction at the present stage lies in enlightening the nation's confidence in construction, so that people can resolutely shoulder the task of national defense construction in order to complete the great goal of the War of Resistance and nation-building. This kind of education can lay the foundation for mobilizing the people and create a tense atmosphere of national construction. Sun Yat-sen's spirit of "revolution first revolution" is especially needed today.

Secondly, it is the training of specialized technical personnel. The bad habits of education in our country for many years have been that it has not created real specialized talents. The talents that have been created are those who can do everything and do nothing well. The reason for this is naturally that the country has not embarked on the road of construction. Even if there are some specialized talents, most of them cannot find suitable jobs, and they are useless in learning, which affects the people who study and develop a sense of versatility and are unwilling to specialize in research. Some people, even if they find a job, cannot do it well because their research is not deep enough, and they have the psychology of seeking easy success. At the same time, schools do not pay attention to practice and the actual needs of society when training, which leads to the development of useless talents who can talk but cannot do, and can do but cannot use. In addition, the place of employment cannot adopt the principle of talent, and what is used is nothing more than relatives and friends who are not talented. Therefore, people who study are even more unwilling to study in depth. This situation is too much of a loss to the country. Since we will need specialized construction talents in the future, and we must pay attention to training specialized construction talents, we must vigorously break the various barriers and malpractices above.

Primary and secondary school education should also strive to cultivate national concepts, because primary school students will be the masters of China in the future, and the future revolutionary task of building the country will be entirely on their shoulders. If we want them to be able to shoulder the task of building the country, we cannot allow them to waste the slightest effort in time.

(7) Conclusion—Self-Reliance

Since we are here to talk about construction, we must first understand the overall meaning and consistent system of construction, so as to avoid the problem of treating the head when it hurts, treating the foot when it hurts, or even treating the foot when the head hurts and treating the head when the foot hurts, and getting into a mess and not finding the main points. However, although I know that construction is an important part of the revolution, and the construction of people's livelihood is the center of all construction, national defense construction is in an especially important position, unified planning management is also the key point of construction, and education is the main driving force of construction, there is still one basic principle that must be followed, which is especially worthy of attention in our country today, which is "self-reliance."

Generally speaking, a country that does not seek independence and relies solely on others will hardly stand in the world for a long time. The painful experience of Abyssinia and the practical lessons of Czechoslovakia have clearly told us this. Sun Yat-sen mentioned the source of construction capital in the "Industrial Plan," advocating attracting foreign investment, but also paying attention to maintaining sovereignty in our own hands, and advocating the use of international capital to prevent any country from controlling our lifeline with its superior economic power and losing our autonomy. The leader further said, "The purpose of my recent promotion of the National Economic Construction Movement is to promote the concerted efforts of the people to develop production and complete the construction of the entire national economy with their own strength. This is the most reliable way. If you don't work hard yourself, relying solely on others is hopeless. ... You must seek survival through self-reliance, and you can stand upright only if you can become strong." This principle of self-reliance has been said in the most sincere way. Although our country is poor and weak and has suffered unprecedented difficulties in history, if our country, both above and below, has the confidence of "self-help and others help," and exerts the great strength that we have, to "do solid work, do hard work, and do quick work," while resisting the war and building the country, the successful realization of the new China of the Three Principles of the People will certainly not be far away.

### After Wang Jingwei's Betrayal

Wang Jingwei's treacherous conduct has now been fully confirmed. At the Provisional Joint Conference of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees on New Year's Day afternoon, it was unanimously resolved to permanently expel Wang from the party and remove him from all official duties due to his solicitation of the enemy to seek surrender, gross violation of discipline, and endangerment of the party and the nation. It is truly a disgrace to the nation and its people that Wang, as a prominent leader of the party and the nation, would stoop so low as to become a national traitor. However, this action by the Central Government demonstrates the strict discipline of the nation and unprecedented progress in politics. Henceforth, pro-Japanese traitors will have no support to rely on, and turncoats will have no room for activity. The government's authority will be greatly enhanced, and the nation will move towards unification. This may very well be the first good news of the 28th year!

Judging from reliable sources, Wang's act of betrayal was not accidental. Before leaving Chongqing, Wang attempted to win over certain wavering elements to control the Fifth Plenary Session; to instigate an anti-communist and armistice movement; and even Konoe's declaration to China had been reviewed by Wang before its publication. After Wang left Chongqing and went abroad, he again attempted to win over a segment of the Central Committee and to instigate certain local military leaders to support his future erratic actions. Fortunately, the nation, from top to bottom, is united in supporting the war effort, and the central authorities have taken appropriate measures. In particular, the military leaders of Sichuan and Yunnan have shown great understanding of righteousness, respecting national interests and loyally supporting the central government's resistance, causing Wang's activities to suffer a major setback. Now, Wang has already left Hong Kong for Shanghai on the 29th of last month. Wang's actions and proposals, whether domestically or internationally, have failed to elicit sympathy or response, and even the Japanese seem to be unable to regard him as a valuable asset. Besides ruining his own future and fully demonstrating the total collapse of certain national scum and corrupt forces, it will not only have no adverse impact on the future of Chinese national liberation, but will instead serve as a sign that the future of the resistance war is secure, which can already be asserted.

However, the conspiratorial activities of Wang and the Japanese traitors have not ceased. It is said that after Wang arrived in Shanghai, he would even convene an illegal Fifth Plenary Session under the protection of the Japanese, in opposition to our Central Fifth Plenary Session, which is one example.

Now that the Central Government has taken strict measures against Wang, Wang can no longer arbitrarily use the name of the Kuomintang to incite chaos, sell out the country, and seek personal gain. The once confused public sentiment will also be stabilized from now on.

In the future, we must further heighten our political vigilance. On the one hand, we hope that military leaders in various regions will take the enlightened authorities of Sichuan and Yunnan as models, wholeheartedly support the central government in resisting the war to the end, and resolutely oppose any compromise or separatist activities; on the other hand, we hope that people from all walks of life will enhance their national self-esteem, increase their belief in the victory of resisting the war and building the nation, consolidate domestic unity, and strive for international assistance. Whether the 28th year will be a year of victory depends entirely on the extent of our efforts!

### Evaluation of the Anti-Communist Front

— Translated by Shi Chang, originally published in the December issue of "Asia Magazine," author: William Henry Chamberlin

What is the real importance of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan? This question has attracted even more attention since Hitler's victorious entry into the Sudetenland; and the Soviet-Japanese war in Zhanggufeng this summer has also increased the importance of this question. Few people can know for sure how close the conflict between the Soviet Union and Japan was to a decisive battle at that time. The preservation of peace was indeed very critical. At that time, Soviet planes bombed the northern part of Japanese-controlled Korea for several days. The Japanese restraint and tolerance saved the peace. It is because Japanese soldiers have never had the doctrine of "accepting insults with a smile." Anyone can imagine how resentful the Japanese officers in the border war zone were when Soviet planes bombed the Japanese positions and the Japanese were not allowed to retaliate. New border conflicts occurred repeatedly, and they could not be resolved satisfactorily. Under such circumstances, future wars will inevitably be affected by the Anti-Comintern Pact. The obligation to oppose the Comintern and the faithful implementation of this obligation are deeply related to future wars.

The Anti-Comintern Pact was initially established on November 2–25, 1936, when it was signed by Japan and Germany in Berlin, stipulating that the governments of the two countries would notify each other of the activities of the Comintern, discuss necessary defensive measures, and implement close cooperation in these measures: jointly agree to take urgent measures to deal with people who directly and indirectly help the Comintern to carry out activities at home and abroad, and invite other countries to join this agreement. About a year later, Italy also joined this agreement. It is very obvious that the inherent meaning of the Anti-Comintern Pact is more important than what it publishes. As for some people's speculation that this agreement has provisions for fighting against the Soviet Union and dividing the Far East into German and Japanese spheres of influence, I think it is not very accurate. In international relations, the situation and opportunities are more important than intentional plans. Japan and Germany are not yet ready to fight against the Soviet Union within a certain designated period. We can see that the Anti-Comintern Pact has four unwritten important meanings: (1) It is a tacit understanding of "insufficient" countries, (2) It is a certificate of sympathy in terms of certain ideas, (3) It is a reflection of the "people's front" strategy of the Comintern, (4) It is a seed for jointly dealing with the Soviet Union in the future, especially for Japan and Germany, there is such a possibility.

Like Germany and Italy, Japan considers itself a country without an heir. It has been unfairly treated in the distribution of world raw materials and colonial markets. It is exploring its investment outlet in China. This is the same situation as Italy's development of Abyssinia and its actions in Spain, and Germany's efforts to seize political and economic control of the Danube River basin. If we do not talk about Germany's commercial interests in China, then Japan and Germany's interests in the Far East do not have serious conflicts. The movement of European borders and the balance of power among European countries are not of much interest to Japan. It is a purely Asian country. Italy does not have important and huge interests in the East. It adopts the method of recognizing "Manchukuo" and openly supporting Japan's actions in China, thinking that helping Japan is in line with Mussolini's policy towards Britain, and Mussolini believes that Japan can win in this war, so he wants to show goodwill to the victor's side, which can protect Italy's interests in the Far East. This seems to be the background of the Italy-Japan-“Manchukuo” trade agreement, hoping that this agreement can increase and balance the trade between Italy and Japan-“Manchukuo.” The total annual trade volume calculated under this agreement is very small, only 54 million Japanese yen, so the importance of this trade agreement belongs to the political aspect, increasing the friendship between the signatories of the Anti-Comintern Pact.

Germany's inclination towards the problem of Japan or China is more complicated and requires a longer period of consideration to seek a solution. After Germany's defeat in the European War, it lost many colonies, overseas investments, and extraterritorial rights. It showed great efforts and patience, and established German trade with China on the basis of manufacturing goods not only shipped to China, but also made German manufacturers actively contribute to China, reaching a certain degree of industrial self-sufficiency. German metal and chemical products sold well in the Chinese market. German technical experts helped China establish new factories. In 1935, Germany had seized Britain's position and ranked third in foreign trade with China, closely following the United States, which ranked first, and Japan, which ranked second. A large number of Chinese military supplies were transported from Germany, and there was also a German military advisory group (led by General Falkenhausen) to help train Chinese cadre military talents and provide valuable knowledge close to modern tactics. Because of this situation, we can see that Germany's Far East policy in the first year of the Sino-Japanese War was two-sided. On the one hand, it was the Anti-Comintern Pact and Germany's additional and favorable trade with Japan. On the other hand, it was the huge benefits of Germany's trade with China and the desire to maintain future Sino-German friendship, and General Falkenhausen and his colleagues resigned without prior agreement, believing that serving in China was an honor, especially when China was at war, and the service contract was not yet fulfilled. These two forces were almost completely equal for a period of time, but the continued service of German officers in China created a most inappropriate situation, because Japan and Germany were allies of the Anti-Comintern Pact and had very close relations. Japan never condemned Germany, and its attacks on countries that aided China were extremely fierce, but in fact, German military experts were the most beneficial foreign aid to China, and a large amount of "German-made" ammunition was also transported to China, entering the hands of the Chinese army via Hong Kong. The Japanese who knew this situation all showed great resentment, and the Japanese diplomatic personnel sent to Germany also expressed strong dissatisfaction. In the spring and early summer of this year, Germany showed a gradual inclination towards Japan, and sent former Japanese military attache Ott to replace Dirksen as the German ambassador to Japan. Ott was the one who worked hard to establish the Anti-Comintern Pact. The German ambassador to China, Trautmann, who sympathized with China, was also recalled to his country. More importantly, General Falkenhausen and most of his colleagues were also recalled to Berlin, and the German government also guaranteed to reduce the shipment of ammunition to China, if not completely stop it. Germany's change of Far East policy is justified. The most important reason is that Hitler wants to use Japan as Germany's ally to jointly deal with the Soviet Union, and after Japan occupied important coastal trading ports in China, Germany's trade with China was greatly affected. Germany wants to adopt a pro-Japanese policy to obtain certain benefits in "Manchukuo" and the Japanese-occupied areas, although some knowledgeable Germans do not have extravagant hopes for these.

The world often predicts the Soviet-Japanese war, but the war is always delayed and has not yet occurred. What exactly is the Soviet-Japanese war? Undoubtedly, this war will eventually become a large-scale and fierce conflict. Two countries that suspect and hate each other often have disputes over border issues, and each builds solid defense works on the border. In addition to border issues, the Soviet Union and Japan also have difficulties and grudges in other aspects, such as the dispute over the fishing treaty, the dispute over the Japanese coal mining rights in North Sakhalin, and the various measures taken by the two countries to prevent each other's espionage activities, etc. Looking at the long term, the hope that the Soviet Union and Japan can maintain peace for a long time is not bright, but in the near-sighted observation, the current state of peaceful pretense often has an "incident" that may continue to be maintained for a considerable period of time. It is very obvious that both sides have reasons to restrain the war. Now Japan has a million troops and countless ammunition in various parts of China. At this time, even the most crazy warlord would not welcome fighting against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is also not welcome to fight against Japan at this time, because its internal purge movement continues to be carried out, losing many capable senior officers of the Red Army, and the European situation is still unstable. The Soviet Union is also unwilling to take action lightly. Under such circumstances, Japan has already received the assistance of the Anti-Comintern Pact, because Germany in Europe has made the Soviet Union station a large number of troops in Europe. If Japan and Germany did not have the relationship of the Anti-Comintern Pact, the Soviet Union could mobilize its troops in Europe to the Far East.

If the Soviet Union or Japan believes that its own strength is sufficient to deal with the other party, then an attack will occur on the border where the incident occurred. The danger of this second Russo-Japanese War is extremely great. It is a great game for the two countries to compete for hegemony in East Asia. If Japan wins this long-term war, then its power on the Asian continent will of course be more solid and stable. After it reaches the position of the leader of the Allies, it can challenge Britain's sea power. Of course, if the Soviet Union fails, it can also weaken the country's will to resist the war. If the Soviet Union wins, it will also have very important consequences. Japan will not only lose the places it occupies in China, but also lose Manchuria and Korea, and even trigger a domestic revolution. Similarly, if the Soviet Union fails, Stalin's dictatorship will inevitably be overthrown, although the entire Soviet administrative rule may still continue to exist. Undoubtedly, both countries are very cautious in considering the possibility of war.

After the Soviet Union and Japan go to war, which country can win? The great writer Tolstoy once said that in war, opportunity and chance are often more important than the most thorough plan. This sentence is even more suitable for modern warfare after scientific development. Predicting the winner of the Soviet-Japanese war is difficult due to the complexity and uncertainty of the international situation. Is Germany going to strike the Soviet Union in Europe now? Will France help the Soviet Union deal with Germany? What is the attitude of the United States? These are all very complicated questions. All we can say is to point out the advantages or strengths that the Soviet Union and Japan can gain in wartime. Which aspect of the strengths is more favorable and can win can only wait for the answer from future history. The Soviet Union's strengths in wartime are: (1) Its aircraft, tanks, and all mechanized weapons are better than Japan's. (2) Its industrial centers and densely populated areas are less vulnerable to air strikes than Japan's industrial centers and densely populated areas. (3) It is rich in resources, and its annual production of coal, steel, and iron is three times that of Japan, and it can be expanded. The Soviet Union also has more than twice as much manpower as Japan. (4) The Soviet Union, unlike Japan, still has to find ways to control "Manchukuo" and many completely peaceful places in North China. Japan's strengths in wartime are: (1) Japan is closer to the war zone, and the railway transportation in "Manchukuo" and Korea is faster and more advantageous than the transportation on the single-track Siberian Railway. (2) According to the opinions of foreign engineers who have worked in the Soviet Union and Japan, Japan's industrial efficiency is higher than that of the Soviet Union. (3) Japan's unity and combat spirit are very good, because Japan is a homogeneous nation, with very little foreign blood and no minority issues.

The future importance of the Anti-Comintern Pact depends on the development of the overall situation in Europe and Asia. Will Europe and Asia gradually be pacified and reach peace? Or will the area of the current struggle be expanded? If the wars in Spain and China gradually cease and a certain new balance is established in Europe and the Far East, then the Anti-Comintern Pact is just a platonic event, with each other issuing statements and information, expressing friendship. This agreement also has no economic value, and Italy's ability to help Japan develop its occupied areas is also extremely limited. However, if there is a tendency towards a major war in Europe and Asia now, and the wars currently taking place in China and Spain are just the prelude to a new world war, then the Anti-Comintern Pact may become a historically noteworthy agreement.

### Wang Zhaoming's Treasonous Collusion with Japan - The Central Government Imposes Severe Punishment, Permanently Expelling Him from the Party and Removing Him from All Positions - The Highest Authorities Will Make a Solemn Statement

(Special dispatch from Chongqing, this newspaper, 1st) The Central Standing Committee held a temporary meeting on New Year's Day afternoon. All Central Committee members in Chongqing attended. When discussing Wang's matter, veteran comrades such as Wu Jingheng and Zhang Ji spoke the most, unanimously criticizing Wang. It was decided to expel Wang from the party. It is heard that the position of Deputy General will not be filled temporarily. Wang's telegram was sent separately to the Military Affairs Commission, the National Government, and the Central Party Headquarters, and has now arrived in Chongqing. Our highest authorities have decided to make a solemn statement. All parties do not approve of Wang's actions and unanimously criticize him.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] The Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee convened a temporary meeting at 3:30 this afternoon. The standing committee members present were Feng Tianqun, Li Wenfan, Ju Zheng, Ding Weifen, Zou Lu, Kong Xiangxi, Sun Ke, Chen Guofu, Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, He Yingqin, Dai Chuanxian. Attending as observers were the executive members Jiao Yitang, Chen Shuren, Jiang Bocheng, Hong Lanyou, Hong Ludong, Ku Nai-kuang, Xiao Tongzi, Wang Luyi, Qian Dajun, Wu Zhongxin, He Jian, Fang Juehui, He Chengjun, Lin Yizhong, Xia Douyin, Su Jisheng, Xu Kan, Liang Hancao, Zhang Bingchang, Chen Shaokuan, Liu Jiwen, Chen Cheng, Mei Gongren, Zhang Daofan, Wang Faqin, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Qun, Chen Bulei, Zhou Qigang, Dai Kuaisheng. The alternate executive committee members Zhao Dihua, Zhu Minyi, Wang Yongbin, Wang Maogong, Chen Fangxian, Zhao Quanyi, Luo Jialun, Zhang Zhen. Supervisory committee members Jiang Zuobin, Lin Sen, Yu Zhen, Ren Zizhuang, He Yaoshan, Yang, Wu Jingheng, Lin Yun, Zhang Ji, Yao Renhai, Shao Lizi, Wang Zhimai. It is heard that also attending as observers were the alternate supervisory committee members Wen Yiduo, Di Chao, Liu Wendao, Wang Shijie, and Li Ciwen. The chairman presided over the meeting and discussed the case of Wang Zhaoming violating discipline and endangering the party and the nation. It was resolved that Wang Zhaoming be permanently expelled from the party and removed from all positions. At the same time, the Central Supervisory Committee also convened a temporary standing meeting and passed the above resolution. The full text is as follows: Resolution of the Chinese Kuomintang on Expelling Wang Zhaoming from the Party. Wang Zhaoming bore the heavy responsibility entrusted by this party. At a time of emergency in the war of resistance, he abandoned his duties, hid in a foreign land, and spread claims that contravene national policy. In a telegram sent on the 29th, he even based his claims on the Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's arrogant declaration of fundamentally destroying our country, and sought peace and reconciliation. At the same time, he secretly coordinated with enemy newspapers to widely disseminate his claims in the name of advising the central government, showing off his skills to shake public sentiment. The content of his telegrams was especially designed to fulfill the enemy's demands, distorting the truth and sparing no effort to defend the enemy, further intensifying his acts and helping the enemy deceive. In terms of his actions, he is in fact colluding with the enemy to seek surrender, and the impact is directly aimed at shaking the foundations of the nation. Our country initiated the war of resistance in order to save itself and survive. The injuries and deaths of over one million soldiers and the sacrifices of millions of compatriots, with deep and painful feelings, are all intended to fundamentally eliminate the Japanese invaders' conspiracy and to forever preserve the generations of life of our country and nation. For more than a year, the people have been united in spirit, and the soldiers have been bravely carrying out orders. With the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, all are of one mind, persevering and unyielding, with the belief that victory will be achieved. Now, the Japanese ambition to plot against our country is becoming more evident, and their tactics are becoming more malicious. The enemy's hatred throughout our country is becoming more intense, and our determination is becoming more resolute. Wang's words are not only abhorred by the central government, but also not tolerated by the people of the country. It has been determined that no citizen may violate the decisions of wartime national policy during the war, and act on his own. This party's discipline absolutely does not allow exceeding the party's formal resolutions, violating the party's rules, and expressing personal opinions. Wang Zhaoming's actions clearly violate discipline and endanger the party and the nation. In the interest of justice, there is no room for leniency. He should be permanently expelled from the party and removed from all positions in order to rectify party discipline and correct public opinion. Our people must know that the most important key to victory in the war of resistance lies in the unity of will and singleness of spirit. In the past, our nation suffered foreign invasions repeatedly, such as the demise of the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, which were only the collapse of one surname and one family's dynasty, not the demise of our nation. However, the reason for their defeat was that the courts at that time were subdued by a small number of treacherous spirits, and their consciences were exhausted, leading to their destruction. It was by no means that the people's spirit and national strength could not resist the Japanese. Therefore, in today's war of resistance, it is not enough to rectify the legal system to invigorate the spirit, and it is not enough to eliminate discord to defeat the strong Japanese. Looking at the recent sinister plans of the Japanese, they are in fact trying to threaten our spirit and lead us to separation and destruction. This party deeply knows that the national consciousness of our compatriots throughout the country is widespread, that the great righteousness of the Spring and Autumn period is promoted, and that it is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. We must be firm and unyielding, adhere strictly to national policy, and unify our will. Final victory will certainly be achieved. From now on, the national policy of resistance will be based solely on the speech delivered by the party's Commander-in-Chief at the Central Commemoration Week on the 26th of last month. May all our comrades throughout the country and soldiers and compatriots, based on this will, devote their full efforts. All words and actions that violate this purpose are not tolerated by national interests and laws, and must be jointly rejected by the people of the country in order to maintain the will of wartime and complete our revolutionary mission to save the country with the Three People's Principles.

### Government Strictly Orders Punishment of Traitors: Eradicating the Corrupt to Uphold National Law

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] The National Government issued an order on the 1st, stating: Since the commencement of the full-scale War of Resistance, the military and civilians of the entire nation have united against the enemy, prioritizing the nation and the people, resolutely resisting aggression, and remaining steadfast in their determination. However, there are a few unscrupulous individuals who willingly allow themselves to be exploited by the Japanese invaders, shamelessly serving the enemy and aiding their tyranny, which is truly abhorrent. The government has previously issued clear orders to the Military Affairs Commission to investigate and apprehend those who participate in the puppet organizations in various regions, and to punish them according to the law. Regulations for the punishment of traitors have already been promulgated, clearly defining criminal provisions for various treasonous acts, and strictly ordering their implementation to eliminate treacherous individuals. Now, as the situation in the War of Resistance turns favorable, the Japanese aggressors are employing endless schemes. Unless the corrupt elements are eradicated and the masses are encouraged, a special reiteration of laws and decrees is made to inform the public: All those who have participated in illegal organizations in various provinces, except those who were truly coerced and are willing to repent and reform, shall be granted an opportunity to start anew and be exempted from prosecution. However, should there be any national traitors who remain unrepentant, or who serve in puppet regimes, or secretly act as Japanese collaborators, daring to defy the condemnation of the world and willing to be abandoned by the people, their crimes are unforgivable. The Military Affairs Commission shall be responsible for conducting thorough investigations, strictly apprehending and punishing them according to the regulations for the punishment of traitors, to uphold national law and satisfy the people's desires. This order.

Wang Jingwei Goes to Shanghai

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] According to reliable sources, Wang Jingwei left Hong Kong on the morning of December 29th aboard the Italian mail steamer Conte Rosso for activities in Shanghai. It is said that Wang had intended to convene an illegal Fifth Plenary Session in Guangzhou, but it was thwarted by various obstacles. He also attempted to meet with a representative of General Zhang Fakui, Deputy Commander of the Fourth War Zone, but was sternly refused. Knowing that he could not operate in Hong Kong, Wang reluctantly went to Shanghai, and may proceed to Nanjing to convene an illegal Fifth Plenary Session. The head of the Japanese special service in South China, He Zhi, has also left Hong Kong for Shanghai to make arrangements. As for the activities of the Doihara principle, that remains to be seen.

[Special Dispatch from Zhongshan for Our Newspaper, 2nd] It is heard here that before leaving Chongqing, Wang Jingwei had planned to influence military leaders in Sichuan and Yunnan to form a pro-Japanese puppet government with himself as its head. However, the military leaders of Sichuan and Yunnan, being fully aware of the greater good, firmly refused to be deceived. Wang's conspiracy was also discovered by the central government, so he ultimately had no choice but to flee far away. However, his ambition has not died, and he is still trying to make trouble. It was rumored earlier that Wang intended to first contact the Japanese, to have the Japanese troops in Guangzhou withdraw to the suburbs and important strongholds in the Pearl River Estuary, in order to deceive the public. At the same time, he would organize a new puppet government in Guangzhou to rally support. But judging from the current situation, this idea seems to have become a thing of the past.

[New Asia News Agency, Hong Kong] According to reliable sources, Wang himself issued the so-called peace proposal last month on the 30th, and then secretly fled to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, he will be under the protection of the Japanese, which is safer than anywhere else. The reliable source also said that the two organizations in Beiping and Nanjing have not been able to unite. This time, Wang Jingwei has arrived in Shanghai and will lead the reorganization of a puppet government to rule Beiping, Nanjing, and other occupied areas, with Wang serving as the so-called president of the puppet organization.

The Overall Situation is Increasingly Optimistic

[Reuters, Chongqing, 1st] Official sources here state that during the Lugouqiao Incident, before the fall of Nanjing, and after the loss of Hankou, Wang Jingwei repeatedly advocated peace. However, he always claimed to support Chairman Chiang and other leaders in their determination to continue the War of Resistance. Chinese sources here feel that China's position today is very strong. In fact, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it has never been as strong as it is today. There are four main reasons for this: (1) The Chinese army has been thoroughly reorganized and redeployed, making it suitable for a long-term war of resistance. (2) As a result of loans from Britain and the United States to China, China's financial position has been greatly stabilized. (3) "The Japanese assurance of protecting the rights and interests of third countries in China has been doubted by Britain and the United States." Therefore, China's international position is also stronger than before. (4) The provinces of the Northwest and Southwest resolutely support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and resistance to the Japanese army has become more profound. The conditions for this resistance are also quite favorable. After the fall of Hankou, China's prospects for the War of Resistance seemed quite bleak, and Wang's proposal for peace was somewhat understandable. But today's situation is improving, and it is almost unbelievable that Wang is talking about peace. Therefore, Wang's actions are not only not endorsed by the government, but also abhorred by the people.

### Zhou Enlai's Remarks: Not Surprised by Wang's Rebellion; Says it Has No Impact on the Situation

[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] Zhou Enlai, a prominent leader of the Chinese Communist Party, stated to Reuters today, "I am not surprised by Wang's peace movement, as I have known Wang for twenty years and have long known him to be a cowardly and timid person. Throughout his political career, he has often changed his views and positions. In 1927, he cooperated with the Communists in Hankou and participated in the Yan-Feng War and the Hu Hanmin Incident in Guangzhou. Whenever difficulties arose, he would betray his colleagues. He is an opportunist who follows the path of least resistance. Wang initially promoted peace negotiations with the Japanese after the fall of Guangzhou and before the loss of Hankou. At that time, he gave a statement to Reuters, stating that China was prepared to negotiate peace. This statement was strongly refuted by the military commanders who participated in the military conference held in Hunan last November, including General Zhang Fakui, who had been a close confidant of Wang for many years. During the National Congress held in Chongqing last November, a close confidant of Wang Jingwei said that China could not rely on the assistance of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, but had to seek the assistance of Germany and Italy to negotiate peace with the Japanese. Wang may have submitted peace proposals to the Japanese through his representative in Hong Kong, and that representative has visited Tokyo at least once. Wang's actions have no impact on China's internal unity or the strength of its resistance. Currently, Wang has no supporters in the Kuomintang, the National Government, or the army, except for a handful of cronies such as Zeng Zhongming and Chu Minyi. It is not yet certain whether Gu Mengyu and Chen Gongbo intend to participate in Wang's actions. The rumor that Wang went to Hong Kong with the understanding of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is purely a rumor. I firmly believe that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek would never have approved of Wang's actions."

### Shanghai Newspapers Denounce Wang

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Shanghai News: Shanghai newspapers have all published the full text of Wang's telegram advocating peace. The headlines and editorials of the newspapers unanimously denounce him, saying that he is destroying his own history and alienating himself from the people.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Shanghai News: Regarding Wang Jingwei's telegram to the central government, the Shen Bao said that Wang Jingwei was completely mad. The Xinwen Bao said that Wang Jingwei actually advocated accepting Japanese peace terms. The Yi Bao said, "Is Wang Jingwei really so muddleheaded? I originally hoped it was a rumor, because since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, we have only seen traitors like Wang Kemin advising the National Government to accept peace proposals. How could Mr. Wang not understand the stakes involved?" The China Morning Post criticized him as being unscrupulous, succumbing to Japan to beg for peace, willingly acting as a traitor, and betraying the party and the country. The Wenhui Bao commented that, "If Wang Jingwei commits seppuku, what will history write about him? It is simply unimaginable. Qin Hui, Wu Sangui, and even Wang Kemin and Qi Xieyuan cannot compare to him." The Dao Bao said, "Is Wang Jingwei really cutting himself off from China?" The Zhongmei Ribao pointed out that Wang Jingwei was completely fooled by Konoe's declaration and was isolating himself from the people. The Damei Wukan said that Wang Jingwei's bizarre peace telegram isolated himself from the nation, and that Wang, having betrayed the country, could not represent the central government and had no great influence on the future of the War of Resistance.

### Great Victory on the Nanxun Front: Our Three-Pronged Attack Yields Significant Gains; A New Gift from the Soldiers of Northern Jiangxi

[Central News Agency, Zhanggongdu, 1st] On the Nanxun front, apart from minor skirmishes between our guerrillas and the Japanese on the north bank of the Xiu River in the past month, there has been no fierce fighting on the main front. Since the morning of the 28th, when the Japanese launched an attack on the north bank of Zhanggongdu and suffered losses, the situation has again become quiet. Our side has long intended to break this stagnant situation and launch a fierce attack on the Japanese. On the eve of New Year's Day, taking advantage of the Japanese unpreparedness, we launched a sudden and fierce three-pronged attack on Yongtiao, De'an, and various key points where the Japanese were stationed. One route first launched a strong assault on the Japanese positions at Huangjinshan and Hejiashan, north of Yongxiu. After fierce fighting lasting about two hours, the Japanese were unable to withstand the attack and retreated in disarray. Our army occupied the area before noon and continued to recover Songzhuang, Hushan, and other places. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties, with over a thousand rifles and many other military supplies and documents captured. Another route also launched an attack simultaneously, recapturing Qingshan, Liuzhuang, Gulaoling, and other places, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers and capturing over ten rifles and three pistols. Yet another route also made rapid progress, capturing Outangshi and Shaxiawang before noon, and continuing to launch a flank attack on the Japanese at Jinzhi. Caught unprepared, the Japanese were thrown into chaos by our strong assault and fled in disarray. Our army pressed forward and launched a fierce attack on the Japanese. Currently, fighting is still taking place in Shatabei and other areas. The long-quiet Nanxun front suddenly reported good news on the auspicious occasion of New Year's Day, the first of the 28th year of the Republic. This is truly the ultimate gift presented by the soldiers on the Nanxun front to the leaders and the people of the country. It can also be seen as a sign that the War of Resistance is entering a new phase.

### Commander-in-Chief of Japanese Forces in Central China, Hata Shunroku, Wounded: Shot by Our Air Force in a Vital Spot; Yamada to Succeed Him

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Shanghai News: Hata Shunroku, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese forces in Central China, was shot by our air force with machine guns in the vicinity of Yueyang last week. His left ribs were seriously injured. At the time, Hata was traveling by car from Hankou to Guangdong, intending to direct military affairs. When he reached the outskirts of Yueyang, he was shot and wounded by our air force. Hata was subsequently sent to Nanjing for treatment. Doihara visited him.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 2nd] According to official sources, General Hata Shunroku, who succeeded Matsui as Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in Central China, has also been removed from his post. His position will be taken over by Major General Yamada, commander of the 12th Division of the Army. Yamada's rank is not only two grades below Hata's, but also below Admiral Shikawa, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in China. Yamada's current whereabouts are unknown. One rumor says he has returned to Japan, while another says Hata is seriously ill and is being treated at a hospital in Nanjing. Wu Tiecheng has gone to Chongqing.

### New Committee of Guangdong Provincial Government Takes Office; Wu Tiecheng Has Gone to Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Lianxian, 1st] The new members of the provincial government held a formal inauguration ceremony at 8:00 AM on New Year's Day. At the same time, the committee members held a handover ceremony, presided over by the former chairman, Wu Tiecheng. In the early hours of New Year's Day, the two chairmen handed over the seals in front of 2,000 people and held a military parade.

### Establishment of Xikang Provincial Government on New Year's Day

[Central News Agency, Kangding, 1st] On the grand morning of the first day of the 28th year of the Republic, Xikang, the newest province in the westernmost part of China, was finally born amidst the severe winter and biting north wind. Special representatives from Tibet participated.

[Central News Agency, Kangding, 2nd] Kang Province has decided to establish five administrative inspectorates, with the selection of candidates still underway. Among them, Du Lüqian and Ren Xiaozhuang are the most highly spoken of.

### New Year's Eve Amidst the Flames of War: Chairman Chiang Remains Diligent All Night; Madam Chiang Launches Fundraising Campaign to Aid Families of Sichuan Soldiers Fighting the Japanese

[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] Last New Year's Eve, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was still busy reviewing important official documents, while Madam Chiang attended a banquet of the New Life Movement Promotion Association. A total of 400 guests were invited to the banquet, and 16,000 yuan was raised on the spot to aid the families of Sichuan soldiers fighting on the front lines. Madam Chiang then auctioned off a silver cup, which was obtained by Lu Zuofu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.

[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] Last New Year's Eve, hundreds of female students, nurses, and Boy Scouts paraded through the main streets with silk banners, which were then presented to Madam Chiang. The banners were inscribed with the words "Leader of Women" and "Savior of Children." London Press Observation.

### Konoe's Statement: Not Worth a Penny; London Press Observation

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The Daily Telegraph, published here, states that while Prime Minister Konoe has suggested withdrawing troops from China, the true rulers of Japan are the senior generals of the army and navy. It questions what ability Konoe or other politicians have to make the troops in China withdraw, or whether it is a preliminary condition for negotiations with China. Even if that were the case, what hope is there that the terms of peace will be more lenient?

[Reuters, London, 31st] Reuters has learned that the Chinese in London express resentment towards Wang Jingwei's actions, fearing that this will give the impression of internal disunity. They repeatedly emphasize that all sections of Chinese society support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and that Chairman Chiang's resolute rejection of Japanese peace terms is also supported by the whole country. They believe that there is no possibility of compromise between China and Japan, and the proposal for China to join the "Japan-Manchukuo" economic bloc has been resolutely rejected, as this would simply place China completely under Japanese control. Commentators deeply doubt Wang Jingwei's ability to rally support, but consider the rumors that Wang will participate in the puppet organizations in Nanjing and Beiping to be ridiculous. Some believe that Wang's actions, if they fail, will be to seek better peace terms from Japan.

### Foreign Minister Wang on the International Situation

[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui published a special commentary, reviewing the development of the international situation last year. Wang specifically pointed out that in November of last year, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States jointly made representations to Japan regarding the opening of navigation on the Yangtze River, and that in November, the United Kingdom and the United States provided loans to China. The tough stance of the Soviet Union in the Soviet-Japanese fishery negotiations shows that although the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union are going their separate ways, they are still proceeding towards the same goal.

### Our Air Force Bombs Nanjing: Several Japanese Garrison Units Hit

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Shanghai News: Our air force again flew to Nanjing on the 30th to bomb the former arsenal, which has now been converted into a Japanese military police garrison. Four bombs were dropped, all of which exploded immediately. The Japanese suffered many casualties.

### Wreckage of Missing Aircraft Found on Yunnan-Chongqing Route: Many Remains Found in the Plane

[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] Word was received here today that the Boeing aircraft that went missing on the Chongqing-Kunming route has been found 240 kilometers southeast of Kunming. The fuselage was destroyed, and the remains of the pilot, the Russian co-pilot, the Chinese radio operator, and the mechanic were found inside.

The cause of the crash is still unknown. It is believed that it may have been shot down by a Japanese plane, which is quite possible in that area. The pilot, Jenson, and his new wife are now in Kunming.

### At the Start of the Second Phase of the War: The Whole Nation Celebrates New Year's Day; People in Various Places Enthusiastically Take on the Heavy Responsibility of Resisting Aggression and Building the Nation; Central National Government Holds Commemoration Ceremony for the Founding of the Republic

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] At the start of the second phase of the war, we happily celebrate the New Year's Day on the 28th year of the Republic.

### Bai Chongxi on the War Situation in the Southwest

(Central News Agency, Guilin, 2nd) Director Bai Chongxi of the Southwest Military Headquarters recently returned here from inspecting the defense lines. In order to understand the latest developments in the Southwest war situation, the reporter paid a special visit this morning to inquire about the situation. Bai said that although the Japanese army in central Guangdong has been slightly active recently, except for the increase of troops to one division in Sanshui, the other areas are still lying in wait and stubbornly defending. The Japanese in Guangzhou are making every effort to consolidate their position, and heavy troops are stationed in Shunde, Huangpu, Zengcheng, Foshan, Sanshui, and Jiujiang, actively building fortifications to protect Guangzhou City and prevent our advance. The strength of the Japanese army in the West River and Beihai has not increased, and they are still entrenched and waiting for reinforcements. Looking at the war on all fronts, it seems to have become quiet on the surface. However, this silence is by no means a standstill. The Japanese strength has been broken, and they are exhausted and unable to launch an attack. It seems that they are trying their best to replenish their strength, so no major battles are likely to occur. However, the Japanese are still actively plotting to invade the West River and Beihai. We have already seen through the Japanese army's various conspiracies, and all routes have been prepared and are waiting in strict formation. The Japanese plan to enter Nanning from Beihai to cut off our important transportation routes, but that transportation route has been completely cut off by us. The grain has been moved, and the guerrillas are swarming. At the same time, the mountains are steep, and the terrain is favorable to us. If the Japanese come to attack, they will be annihilated. Although the Japanese attempt to attack Wuzhou from the West River has been thwarted, they have not given up the idea of invading. If the Japanese come again, the difficulties they will encounter will be ten times greater than before. The second phase of the full-scale War of Resistance has begun, and we are determined to advance by implementing a comprehensive strategy of striking the Japanese. Therefore, I have been actively promoting methods of emphasizing politics over military affairs and the masses over soldiers. In particular, after this trip to the front, I deeply feel the importance of political power. In Guangxi, we plan to formulate a national public agreement and regulations. Once approved, we will order all the people of the province to swear to abide by them. The content is roughly as follows: In terms of combat, agree not to be traitors, not to be submissive people, not to be Japanese spies, not to participate in puppet organizations, not to build roads for the Japanese, and not to serve the Japanese. In terms of economics, agree not to buy Japanese goods, not to use Japanese materials, not to use Japanese currency, and not to cooperate with the Japanese economically. If this plan is implemented in Guangxi, I will propose to the central government that it be adopted. I believe that this will have great power in the overall strategy of the War of Resistance.
