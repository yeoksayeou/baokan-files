### Smashing the × Army's South China Strategy

Since the × Army of South China, employing a cone-shaped piercing tactic, seized Guangzhou from Daya Bay, it has, for several months, been intensifying the construction of defensive fortifications in the suburbs of Guangzhou on the one hand, attempting to hold key points firmly to prevent a large-scale siege by our army; and on the other hand, it has been stationing troops in Sanshui, preparing to advance up the West River to invade Guangxi. Fortunately, our army quickly adjusted and calmly contained them. The people have risen up, launching strikes against the enemy at any time and any place, having already seized the initiative and stabilized the war situation. However, judging from the recent continuous reinforcement of troops to the West River by the × and the frequent appearances of × warships near Beihai, the intention to seize Guangxi is still unabated. Guangxi is a barrier to the southwestern hinterland and an advanced position for recovering Guangzhou. Its safety and loss have long been the focus of national attention. Therefore, a brief explanation based on publicly available materials is provided below.

The entire province of Guangxi is characterized by winding mountain ranges and rapid currents. Furthermore, the political system is on the right track, and the people have simple and robust customs. The × knows that attempting to lay hands on it will inevitably involve significant sacrifices. However, to cut off our Sino-French international transportation line and threaten the southwestern provinces, there is indeed a need to bet everything on a single throw. Therefore, although the South China × naval and land forces have hesitated to move beyond Sanshui, they are simultaneously spreading smoke screens of plotting against Guangxi, deploying new offensives. The reason for this lies herein. According to general speculation, the reason why the × has been unable to carry out military operations to seize Guangxi is due to the shared hatred of the enemy among the soldiers and civilians in Guangdong, preparing to launch a counteroffensive. The invasion routes to Guangxi are also the most difficult choices for the South China × leadership. In fact, the × can only advance into Guangxi from Guangdong via four routes, and on each route, the × must risk tremendous danger to gain even a small piece of land:

(1) Advance up the West River from Sanshui to attack Cangwu. This route is the shortest route to invade Guangxi because shallow-water warships can navigate the West River below Cangwu year-round, and the × naval and land forces can launch a joint offensive. However, at present, in addition to stationing heavy troops to guard key areas in the lower reaches of the West River to block the enemy's land invasion, our army has strictly blockaded the West River waterway above Zhaoqing, prohibiting passage. (Taking the Chicken Cage Island blockade line downstream of Cangwu as an example, the depth reaches ten miles.)

(2) Use the navy to take the route through the Gulf of Tonkin, land in Beihai, and proceed through Lianzhou (Hepu), Qinzhou, and Xixiang to Yongning (Nanning) and Longjin (Longzhou), cutting off the Sino-Vietnamese transportation line, obstructing our international transportation, and then follow the extension line of the Xiang-Gui Railway, go north to Liuzhou, and strike at the back of Guilin. This route has attracted the most attention from the general public. However, according to those familiar with the situation, Beihai has a lot of sand and shallow water, making it extremely difficult for enemy large ships to approach the shore, and landing troops is particularly difficult. Even if the × successfully lands, the "Shiwandashan" (Ten Thousand Great Mountains) obstructs them west of Lianzhou and Qinzhou, making it impossible for enemy mechanized units to fly over. We have built national defense works in this area and dispatched elite ××× divisions and ××× divisions to closely monitor it, making it difficult for the enemy to succeed.

(3) Use the navy to land near Guangzhou Bay (or Beihai), follow the highway north to attack Yulin, and then pass through Rongxian to attack the rear of Cangwu. In addition to stationing heavy troops to guard this area, we have completely destroyed all highways south of Yulin. (In the past, those going to Hong Kong and Shanghai from Guangxi mostly passed through Guangzhou Bay. Since the destruction of the highways, they now have to change their route and go through Yongning and Longjin out of Zhennanguan, and then go to Hong Kong and Shanghai via Hanoi.) Moreover, due to the natural barrier of the Goulou Mountains, even if they land, it will be difficult to penetrate deeply.

(4) Use the army to go northwest from Sanshui, along the Suijiang River through Sihui and Guangning, and enter the Guangxi territory at Huaiji, then turn to Kaijian to flank Cangwu. This route was the route taken by Yue Fei of the Southern Song Dynasty to suppress Cao Cheng. It is located in the border area of the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan. If it goes out to the northwest, it will also threaten Guilin and Hengyang. However, because the highways have been completely destroyed and there is the complicated Kuai Zhu Ridge, it is difficult for the modernized × army to seek development.

According to the estimates of some strategists, most people believe that the × will send their main force to Beihai and launch a supporting attack on the West River. However, the × strategy may be the opposite. After all, the West River is a shortcut, and the difference in difficulty compared with landing in Beihai is vast. At present, the highways in the Guangdong war zone and the quasi-war zone are being actively destroyed, but unfortunately, they are often not thorough enough. The highways in Guangxi province near the quasi-war zone have been completely destroyed. In many places, reservoirs have been created by blocking mountains and rivers, or they have been cultivated into farmland, and even the traces of the highways have disappeared. Therefore, it is almost a dream for the × to enter Guangxi using highways.

Geographical conditions are sufficient to hinder the × from entering Guangxi, and the spirit of building spiritual fortresses among the people of Guangxi is even stronger. Guangxi's conscription performance has always been excellent. Although there was a phenomenon of evading military service in the second half of last year, the provincial government authorities remedied it early, and normalcy has long been restored. Furthermore, in preparation for a long-term total war, the young adults in the province are undergoing guerrilla warfare training. They are also using existing civilian firearms to cultivate self-defense forces. According to recent statistics, the province's districts, counties, townships, and villages have more than one million directly administered young adult guerrilla team members (from eighteen to forty-five years old), with approximately three to four hundred thousand firearms. In addition to practicing guerrilla warfare on the spot, they are also engaged in guide, detective, disciplinarian, traitor extermination, transportation (manpower, animal power, and material resources), rescue, reception, laundry, sewing, stretcher bearing, and burial duties. Therefore, if the × are fortunate enough to cross into Guangxi province, in addition to facing the attacks of our regular army on the front, these more than one million long-trained guerrilla team members will inevitably impede them everywhere, causing them to have uneasy sleep and meals, making it difficult to advance or retreat, and ultimately leading to their destruction.

In addition, there are many uncivilized ethnic minorities in Guangxi, such as the Miao and Yao. The authorities have attached great importance to this early on, in light of the lessons of the Miao rebellions in the Song and Ming dynasties. Therefore, since the 23rd year of the Republic of China, they have established special teacher training institutes, recruiting young people from the Miao and Yao ethnic groups to enter the institutes for training, so as to make them the main force for developing ethnic minorities. They also regularly dispatch political workers to work in the mountainous areas of the Miao and Yao ethnic groups, and the results are quite considerable. Since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, although these ethnic minorities have not yet participated in combat, most of the young adults of various ethnic groups have been trained by military instructors dispatched by the authorities to the area. At present, there are more than × thousand Miao and Yao ethnic group young adults who can be assembled on the spot at any time to strike the enemy. This news should be welcomed by those who are concerned about the problems of ethnic minorities in the southwest.

Commentary

### On the Supreme National Defense Council

— Gao Ge

Adapting to the new needs of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council is the most significant achievement of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and it is also the most significant achievement of the Chinese nation in the year and a half of heroic resistance under the call, influence, and direct leadership of the revolutionary party. It will have a very significant and positive impact on the future of the Chinese national liberation movement and the future of the Eastern national revolutionary movement, making people feel infinite excitement and infinite expectation.

Based on news from various relevant parties in China and abroad, the Supreme National Defense Council, established by the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session, has particularly significant nature and meaning. First, the Supreme National Defense Council is the highest organ for managing the military and political affairs of the country and leading the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, outside the Central Executive Committee. The National Government serves as its political executive organ, the Military Affairs Commission serves as its military executive organ, and the Central Party Headquarters serves as its party affairs executive organ. All important military, political, party, and mass movements related to the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction can be decided and implemented by the meeting, with the aim of coordinating all activities of resistance, increasing the nation's human and material resources, and striving for final victory. Looking back at the facts of the year and a half of the War of Resistance, although there has been progress in all aspects, the serious existence of shortcomings and obstacles in all aspects is also an undeniable fact. In particular, the failure to properly and effectively adjust the party, government, and mass movement organizations at all levels, and the failure to perfectly concentrate and uniformly distribute the nation's human and material resources. Now that the Supreme National Defense Council has been established, it will fully accept the past experience and lessons, and further promote the progress of military, political, party, and mass movements in order to complete the great cause of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction.

Second, the Supreme National Defense Council, established by the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session, is the product of the consolidation and expansion of the Anti-Japanese National United Front, and it is a national alliance that adapts to the new stage of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. At the same time, it is also the supreme command that fairly represents public opinion. The members of the council include party, government, military, and cultural leaders, and leaders of various parties and factions other than Kuomintang members are also invited to participate. For example, Communist leaders Mao Zedong and Zhu De, although not participating in the organization, have also been invited. It can truly be praised as "creating a new era in the political history of our country." Since the War of Resistance, the National United Front has become increasingly consolidated, and popular organs such as the National Political Council have begun to show their strength, but its consolidation and its strength are still far from sufficient. On the contrary, the divisive conspiracies of the × people, traitors, and pro-Japanese elements, and defeatists are rampant. The declaration of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Communist Party of China last October sincerely supported the National Government and supported Chairman Chiang, and proposed specific measures to strengthen national unity, strengthen KMT-CPC cooperation, consolidate the United Front, and establish a national alliance, the main intention of which was to overcome the × people's conspiracies of division and destruction, and strive for final victory. Now that the Supreme National Defense Council has been established, actually carrying out the task of its national alliance and even the supreme organ of national defense, not only will KMT-CPC cooperation and national unity be better guaranteed in the future, making all × people, traitors, pro-Japanese elements, and defeatists lose the opportunity to sow discord, spread rumors, and undermine, but also the mutual relations between the government and the people, the central and local governments, and various departments of military, political, party, and mass movements will be closer, and the government's prestige among the people and internationally will be enhanced. In the history of the Eastern national revolution, it has truly opened the most glorious page.

However, we must recognize that the establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council, on the one hand, is the "crystallization" of the past year and a half of heroic War of Resistance's experience and lessons, and on the other hand, it is only the establishment of a foundation for striving for victory in the second stage of the War of Resistance. How to stop the × people's offensive, develop rear area construction, advance our army's counteroffensive, and strive for final victory in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction will depend on more heroic, more serious, and more appropriate struggles. Especially in this period of transition from the first stage of the War of Resistance to the second stage, in this "building up a mountain nine cubits high," the turning point of victory or defeat, the × people's final, most fierce, and most cruel offensive is just beginning, and the conspiracies of the × people, traitors, and lurking pro-Japanese elements and defeatists, who advocate "anti-communism," "peace," "establishing a peace and national salvation army," and "establishing a central government," are also just beginning. We must particularly recognize the difficulties and dangers of the current situation. In particular, the Supreme National Defense Council must urgently implement a revolutionary new strategy in the military, stop the × people's offensive, and develop preparations for a counteroffensive; in politics, thoroughly improve political institutions at all levels and realize democratic politics and the improvement of people's livelihoods during the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction; in the economy, fully implement the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction program and the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session; and in diplomacy and education, use all efforts for the central task of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression War of Resistance. In addition, we must also pay attention to: (1) developing the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and all anti-Japanese parties, and concentrating all forces under the leadership of the Supreme National Defense Council to support the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction; (2) rigorously carrying out the anti-traitor movement, thoroughly eliminating traitors, spies, pro-Japanese elements, and defeatists, and all traitorous puppet organizations, and also thoroughly sweeping away the propositions that use the name of "peace and national salvation" and "anti-communism and national salvation" to divide and undermine our unity in the War of Resistance.

The establishment of the Supreme National Defense Council will undoubtedly give the Japanese fascist aggressors a fatal blow, and will become a great guarantee of the liberation of the Chinese nation and the safety of the Far East and world peace. Every Chinese son and daughter who does not want to be a slave of a fallen country and every international person who advocates justice and peace and demands freedom will rejoice, praise, and be inspired by the emergence of this great force. We must respond to this progress of our government with greater enthusiasm in contributing wealth, labor, and knowledge, and support the Supreme National Defense Council in smoothly carrying out its great and glorious task of liberating the Chinese people and striving for human happiness!

### Heshan

— Jie Ru

The Vanguard of the West River Southern Route

[Special Report from this Newspaper] Heshan, this is the vanguard of the West River Southern Route in Guangdong. It is located in the lower reaches of the West River, grasping the key to traffic up and down the West River. In peacetime, it is only a third-class county, but since the invaders' × hooves stepped into the southern coast of our motherland, after the loss of most of the south, its position has become increasingly important with the shifting of the war. If the × wants to invade from the West River, then Heshan is also a necessary route. Therefore, in order to protect the various places on the West River Southern Route, it is necessary to defend Heshan firmly. If Heshan—the vanguard of the West River Southern Route—can always defend firmly, then the invaders' attempt to trample the various places on the West River Southern Route will undoubtedly turn into a dream.

From Guangning, the mountainous area on the border of western Guangdong, the guerrilla capital, we walked countless rugged mountain roads and those destroyed highways. After four days of long-distance walking, we arrived at Heshan, the vanguard of the West River Southern Route. It was four o'clock in the afternoon on January 13th. We, with a pair of tired feet and a tired body, ran into Shaping, the chief town of Heshan County. Here, the distance from the Haikou, where the × and our armies are confronting each other, is only about ten miles. The sound of cannons fired across the river is often so heavy and clear. Heshan, it is now like a brave warrior who has been in battle for a long time, standing firmly and calmly on the front line of the West River Southern Route. The sound of cannons, machine guns, and the bombing of airplanes cannot make it appear flustered and frightened. When our footsteps first stepped into Shaping, its scene was greatly beyond our expectations. Who would have known that this city and town, which is so close to the front line, could still maintain such calmness and such prosperity?

From Guangning to Heshan

From Guangning, a mountainous area, the guerrilla capital, we walked through two days of mountain roads, emerged from the mountains in the northwest, bid farewell to the lonely ancient city lying on the hillside, and walked down the vast Gaoyao plain. In Lubu in Gaoyao County, we took a ferry eastward, arriving at Zhaoqing, an important town in the middle of the West River, that night. The next morning, we crossed the river from Zhaoqing again, and walked along the Yaoming Highway, which had been destroyed, to Baitou. At Baitou, we turned onto a small mountain path, arriving at Gaoming City in the evening. Although Ming City is still far from the front line, it has become very lonely due to the bombing of airplanes and the threat of gunpowder gas. We stayed here for one night, and the next day we hoped to jump to Shaping.

After eating breakfast at six o'clock, we began to move the exhaustion that had not yet been restored to the new journey. This section of the road from the mountain city to Yangmei in Heshan is another small mountain path. Fortunately, there are still many pedestrians on this small road. On the one hand, there are travelers coming from Heshan, preparing to pass through Ming City and enter the interior; on the other hand, there are travelers coming out from the interior, preparing to pass through Heshan and transfer to overseas. On the other hand, there are also coolies and women who transport fruits, incense powder, bamboo strips, and other local products from the interior to Jiangdou in Heshan, because this is a key route for transportation between the interior and overseas, so there are an unusually large number of people coming and going. A mountain road that winds for more than 40 miles is constantly crowded with travelers and coolies. It is indeed quite lively.

At the junction of Gaoming and Heshan, there is a small market town. This is Yangmei (not Yangmei in Sanshui). In the past, Yangmei was just a small and not very prosperous market town, but since the destruction of the Heshan-Gaoming Highway, this place has become the most convenient for transportation between Heshan and Gaoming. The number of people walking this road has gradually increased, so it has also prospered accordingly. When people run out of the winding mountain path and walk over that small hillside, what first catches their eyes is a large group of coolies and sedan chair carriers gathered in front of the market, like a group of ants swarming together. It is truly a spectacular sight. Sedan chairs—those simple ones with only two bamboo poles, a seat board, and a footrest pole—are placed on the ground in rows. It seems that there are at least one or two hundred of them. The scene is really lively beyond precedent. As for the crowd inside the market, it goes without saying.

From Yangmei to Shaping, there are another 40-odd miles of mountain paths. I don't know why, but after passing Yangmei, the number of pedestrians on the mountain paths decreased. The deeper you go, the fewer people there are, until you come out of Longkou, where the number of people increases again. This is no longer walking on a mountain path, but on a destroyed highway. Walking along the Shajin—Shaping to Jinshu—Highway for more than ten miles, you step into Shaping.

A Glimpse of Shaping

Today's Shaping is not only a commercial center, but also a military stronghold. It is only about ten miles away from the Haikou, where the × and our armies are confronting each other, and it is also no more than ten miles away from Gulao, which has been burned down by the ×. When the news of the fall of Guangzhou reached here, and the sound of cannons from Jiujiang being trampled by the × came, it did indeed have a chaotic and panic-stricken situation, but soon it became quiet and strong again.

Although the Shaping Railway Station has been bombed many times by the big-brand iron birds, it is still stubbornly alive. We rested our feet in a hotel next to the station, and then went to the streets to inspect it again. In the past, the Chongde Sandfield area of Shaping was a very prosperous place, but since the Chongde Road area was bombed, it has become deserted. Now there are only a few loads of vegetables that are difficult to place there, and there are not many pedestrians. Although the shops are still open, there are very few customers. The prosperous scene of shoulder-to-shoulder crowds in the past has been relegated to the city center, where pedestrians and vendors are extremely crowded. As for Bank Road, it was originally the financial center of Heshan. Usually, all the banking, remittance, and banking companies are located here. The road is very tidy and clean. Since the bombing, the situation has been very different from the past. Most of those silver houses and money shops are closed, but the other industries are mostly the same as in the past.

The food shops, teahouses, and restaurants in Shaping are doing very well, because there are many people passing through, so they earn a lot of money. There is also an ice room here, with various drinks such as milk and coffee, and Western pastries for customers. This is indeed something that is not available all the way from Guangning to Heshan. In addition to the ice room, there is also a women's barbershop here. Although the hairdressers are in the midst of × soldiers close by and continuous artillery fire, they can still put on heavy makeup, wear light clothes and curved hair, and smile and wink to deal with customers. Their customers are mostly lonely travelers. They talk and laugh with each other. In one room, there is a peaceful atmosphere, making people forget the beacon fire in front of them.

The people living in Shaping don't seem to feel anything about the cannons they hear every day. They are still doing their business, and the idlers who are watching the tricks in front of the Jianghu people selling plaster stalls don't seem to be nervous, but they are calm.

From Shaping to Weidun

At the North Street entrance of Shaping, we took a small awning boat to Weidun. This is a very small and narrow river. Along this small river, one end can lead to Haikou Gubou, and the other end can lead to Shengping Paigu Lao. The general name for Shengping Town and Gulao is Weidun. It includes several market towns and many villages, because it is surrounded by a dike, and there are ponds and rivers crisscrossing inside.

The small boat is in Shengping Town (the local name is Daokou Market, which sounds like Dakou Market in Guangzhou dialect). The market has only one street, which is very small, but since Gulao was attacked by the ×, all the businesses in Gulao have moved to Shengping Town. So when we landed, even though it was almost sight, there were still so many people on the streets. The cement street was so wet and dirty that walking on it made your feet feel floating and slippery, almost falling. There are no guesthouse facilities here, so we had to walk those winding mulberry paths for several miles to live in the countryside.

This village is called Jiurenhe. Most of the residents here are surnamed Ma and Li. Since the × army invaded Gulao, most of them have never left their village. They have become accustomed to the machine guns and cannons that the × people sweep over from Heqing and Shakou every day, and the airplanes that fly over the Weidun area to scout and drop bombs. Their fishing is still fishing, and their shrimp catching is still catching shrimp. All of their lives are no different from usual, even though this place is about to become the front line.

The next morning, amidst the symphony of cannon fire, machine gun fire, airplane sounds, and bomb sounds, we ran from Jiurenhe to Shengping Town. The residents of the town did not feel anything at all. They were still doing business. At a congee shop at the end of the market, we ate a bowl of fish and meat congee. We asked the old woman who sold the congee if these gunshots and cannon fire were there every day. She replied that they used to be there every day, but they had been silent for a week, and only since yesterday had there been such gunshots and cannon fire again. At the end, she said:

"What are we afraid of! They can't come over!"

After eating the congee, we continued along the dike to Shuangqiao Market. The further we went, the louder the sound of gunfire became. After walking for twenty minutes, we arrived at Shuangqiao Market. Shuangqiao Market is very close to Gulao. The shells fired by the × army in Heqing had hit near it. On the way to Shuangqiao Market, a large banyan tree on the dike was blasted off one side, and several houses were collapsed by another shell. But one thing is that Shuangqiao Market, which is within the range of the × people's shells, is still as prosperous as Shengping Town. The people who were going to the market were still as crowded and coming and going. Despite the sound of gunfire, machine gun fire, airplane sounds, and bomb sounds that were ringing in their ears, people were still trading and living, and the state of peace was unbelievable.

We stayed in Shuangqiao Market for less than a few minutes, and then hurried back to Shengping Town to call the small boat to row back to Shaping. On the way, the constant sound of bombs and cannons was still ringing loudly.

When we returned to Shaping, it was already twelve o'clock at noon. We quickly ran to Yugang, took the only remaining small section of the Jiang-Fo Highway to Shuanglong, and walked to Jiangmen again. It was dusk again. (Morning of January 25, 1939.)

### National Military Redeployment: New Developments in the War Situation; Northern Puppet Troops Extensively Mobilized; Our Army's Prestige Greatly Enhanced in Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, and Shandong

(Our Chongqing Dispatch, 1st) The Fifth Plenary Session has concluded. It is reported that new military deployments have been made, and the war situation will soon see new developments. According to reports, puppet troops in various occupied areas of the north have been extensively mobilized in recent days, mostly for troop rotations and a show of force. However, fighting continues in northeastern Shandong and at the borders of Hebei and Chahar. The puppet troops in Shanxi are increasing their forces southwestward, with fierce fighting continuing in Jie County, Yincheng, and Yu Township. There is contact between Linjin and Ronghe. Our troops are firmly defending strongholds in the Zhongtiao Mountains, and we once attacked the Shuitou Station.

[Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 1st] The enemy along the Tongpu Railway has been extremely vigilant recently, especially at night, with increased troops lying in ambush on both sides of the tracks to prevent our sabotage of the rails.

They fled towards Zengcheng via Hanjia Village after wiping out approximately 800 to 900 enemy troops. A unit of our forces is still in pursuit.

[Minko News Agency, Xingji, 1st] There are currently 200 to 300 enemy troops inside Hejin City and 300 enemy troops in the Fancun Guzhen area. Fearing our attacks, they light fires in the outer villages at night for警戒 until dawn, when they return. Enemy troops in Jishan have increased in recent days but have not yet attacked. It is also reported that Yishi County has been recovered by a unit of our forces. The enemy in Jiaocheng has increased to over 1,000 cavalry and 300 infantry, with 52 artillery pieces. On the morning of the 26th, they divided into three routes to attempt to ambush us to the west and are currently engaged in combat with our troops in the Fanjiashan Qulicun and Lujiashan areas.

Surrender of Puppet Army Commander

[Minko News Agency, Xingji, 1st] Over 500 enemy cavalry troops who attacked westward from Huoxian, fled to Bailong Village (west bank of the Fen River) and still seem to be trying to attack westward. Enemy planes have been frequently flying near Fenxi County for reconnaissance in recent days. The enemy troops in Shangxia Leping Village and Dazhang Village east of Huoxian were attacked by a unit of our forces the night before last. At approximately 2 a.m., our forces rushed to the outskirts of Dazhang Village. The enemy resisted stubbornly from their defensive positions, and fierce fighting continued until dawn, resulting in the death of over 40 enemy troops, with only a few casualties on our side. Furthermore, most of the enemy troops in Dui Jiugu and Hujia Yao areas have retreated, and units of our forces are now approaching the vicinity of Dui Town. The commander of the enemy警備隊, feeling defeated and in a desperate situation, has surrendered to a division of our forces. The enemy who attacked our Huanglong Ridge, Majia Ridge, and Taohua Cha areas were routed by a fierce assault by our troops. The remaining enemy troops fled in all directions towards Jie County, with a portion fleeing west to the areas of Shigou Village, Miaoqian Village, and Hanjia Village. We have recovered Majia Ridge, Moao, and other places, and a unit is still pursuing the remaining enemy troops westward.

At approximately 1 p.m. on the 31st, the enemy troops in Qiujin once again shelled the Tong'anling area on our south bank with several shells. However, this is equivalent to the enemy's homework on the Xiushui battlefield for three days. We suffered no losses and did not retaliate.

### Wu Peifu's Remarks Contradict the Enemy's Propaganda; People in Beiping and Tianjin Slightly Comforted Upon Hearing Them

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st] Tianjin report: The enemy's attempts to lure Wu Peifu into serving in a puppet position have been intense. A few days ago, they incited hooligans in Beiping and Tianjin to send telegrams supporting Wu. There were also rumors that Wu had accepted a puppet position. They scheduled a meeting between Wu and over 130 Chinese and foreign journalists on the 30th. Beforehand, the enemy's special service agency prepared a draft of the remarks to be delivered on the spot. Unexpectedly, the content of Wu's remarks during the meeting was completely contrary to the enemy's prepared draft. Wu not only did not express his intention to accept the position but also put forward three conditions, stating that peace could not be achieved unless these conditions were met. The foreign journalists were shocked, and even the enemy supervisors were dismayed. They ordered the censorship agency to withhold foreign journalists' telegrams and, at the same time, had the enemy's prepared remarks sent out by the Domei News Agency in an attempt to cover up the situation. Wu's attitude was very firm, and he disregarded any threats or inducements. The people of Beiping and Tianjin were greatly relieved to hear this.

### Mr. Hu Yuzhi's Lecture: The Current Situation of the War of Resistance

—Notes from Our Reporter—

——Yesterday at the Hong Kong YWCA——

It is very necessary to study the problem of "The Current Situation of the War of Resistance" at this time. Because since the fall of Guangzhou and the retreat from Wuhan, the short two or three months have been filled with rapid and progressive changes.

The military conference held in Hengshan on November 25 last year divided the period after the retreat from Wuhan as the first phase of the War of Resistance, and the period after the retreat as the second phase. There are obvious differences in the current situation between the first and second phases.

The Hengshan Conference made important decisions on the military, economic, political... and other departments of the second phase of the War of Resistance, and the Fifth Plenary Session recently conducted concrete discussions and final decisions.

Now, I will report to you the new current situation of the second phase of the War of Resistance.

Military Aspect: It can be divided into four points:

First, Strategic Aspect

In the first phase of the War of Resistance, we were in a passive position to respond to the war: retreating from Shanghai to Nanjing, from Nanjing to Xuzhou, from Xuzhou to Wuhan. Although we also fulfilled the task of消耗 the enemy, we were still unable to achieve the initiative to annihilate the enemy. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said at the Hengshan Conference that guerrilla warfare is more important than regular warfare in the future, allocating one-third of our total military force to the front line to fight the enemy, one-third of the military force to consolidate our rear, and one-third of the military force to attack the enemy's rear, so that the enemy is surrounded by us from all directions. Not only can the enemy not achieve their dream of a quick victory, but they simply do not have the military force to allocate to the vast battlefield. From a new strategic perspective, we have the confidence of victory.

Second, Terrain Aspect

The terrain of the second phase of the War of Resistance extends deep into the highlands and mountains of the southwest and northwest. The enemy's navy cannot exert its power, and the use of the air force is also difficult. The mechanized units of the army will also encounter geographical obstacles everywhere. Therefore, this terrain is the most unfavorable for the enemy and the most favorable for our army. After we induce the enemy to go deep, we will eventually annihilate the main force of the enemy. Therefore, from the perspective of terrain, we also have the confidence of victory.

Third, Human Resources Aspect

We are actively mobilizing the strength of the whole people to participate in the War of Resistance. In fact, our national morale and fighting spirit are also getting stronger and stronger. The decision to place politics above military affairs is also a rapid progressive phenomenon after the Hengshan Conference. On the other hand, the number of enemy soldiers invading China is over one million, exceeding the original plan by many times. Japan's strength is limited, and it is impossible to increase its troops any further. Therefore, in terms of human resources, we are superior to the enemy, and we have the confidence of victory.

Fourth, Weapons Aspect

Some people think that the enemy's weapons are better than ours. In fact, this was the case in the first phase of the War of Resistance, but the second phase is different. The enemy's navy, army, and air force have lost their effectiveness, as mentioned above. As for China, the air force in the southwest and northwest is improving quickly. Over the past year or so, our air force has made rapid progress.

In the future, the main determinant of victory or defeat will be the army. Our mechanized elite units will be at least 20 divisions or more, which is several times more than the enemy. Most of these elite units are prepared to annihilate the enemy in one fell swoop during the general counter-offensive. This is a solid fact.

Looking at the three months since the fall of Guangzhou, the enemy's progress has been very little. This is not because the enemy has stopped attacking, but because its strength has been exhausted and it has fallen into the quagmire of suffering. Although it sometimes relies on the strength of its navy and has the appearance of being eager to try in places such as Beihai, the West River, and the Yangtze River, it is only limited to harassment and has no great strength to attack.

Under such difficult circumstances, the enemy naturally hopes to end the war as soon as possible. Therefore, there was the 近衛均 peace declaration in December last year, and the conditions it proposed were not as harsh as before. This shows how trapped the enemy is.

But are we going to fall into the enemy's trap and talk peace with them? Only traitors and ignorant people have such dreams. In the first phase of the War of Resistance, we were able to endure bitterly for eighteen months under many unfavorable circumstances. Now we are in an absolutely favorable situation, and the enemy is at the end of its rope. To talk about peace and surrender at this time, only traitors are willing to sell out the interests of the entire good race. (The audience clapped enthusiastically)

Therefore, in the second phase of the War of Resistance, in terms of military affairs, whether it is strategy, terrain, human resources, or weapons, we are superior to the enemy, and we absolutely have the confidence of victory.

Next, let's take a look at the political phenomenon of the second phase of the War of Resistance, which is even more optimistic.

(Due to space limitations, the second half of the political aspect will continue to be published tomorrow.) —Zhuoqi—

### Customs Officials Enthusiastically Patriotic; Integrity of Customs Sovereignty; Retired Customs Officials Cannot Bear to Receive Foreign Exchange Profits; Import and Export Customs Forms Have Not Been Revised to Use Japanese

[Shanghai Correspondence] Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the customs offices in the north and south have been in special circumstances due to the changes in the Chinese side's positions. The government is very concerned about the sovereignty and administration of the customs offices and is planning to improve them. The following is a summary of the various situations:

Sovereignty and Administration Still Intact

Robert Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, handles all customs administration in accordance with the orders of the central government. Therefore, although the various customs offices are in special circumstances, the sovereignty and administration are still intact. Previously, some customs officials, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, requested the Military Affairs Commission to rectify the discipline of the various customs offices and strive for economy. The Military Affairs Commission approved it and handed it over to the Ministry of Finance for verification. The customs authorities also believed that in the face of national crisis, civil servants should strive to be motivated and save the country through economy. They immediately instructed their subordinates to strictly comply.

Pensions Changed to Foreign Exchange Purchases

Customs officials have a system of monthly savings for pensions, which are paid out upon retirement. This amount is considerable. Since the sudden outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the customs offices have changed the customs officials' monthly pension savings from bonds to foreign exchange. Over the past year, due to the rise in foreign exchange, all retiring customs officials who are entitled to receive their pensions have received almost twice as much as before the war due to the increase in prices after purchasing foreign exchange. However, this type of profit on foreign exchange is purely wartime profit. The retiring customs officials believe that this profit is indirectly increasing the country's foreign exchange expenditure. Many have petitioned the central government, stating that since they are public servants of the country and the war is ongoing, and most civil servants in the provinces are paid with reduced salaries, why should retiring customs officials be exempt from receiving this foreign exchange profit? It is reported that the Ministry of Finance is investigating the situation regarding the opinions of retiring customs officials and will make a decision on how to handle it.

Strict Prohibition of Exaggerated Reporting of Housing Allowances

Customs officials receive housing allowances and other benefits in addition to their monthly salaries. The regulations have always been very strict. Higher-ranking officials receive approximately 50 yuan per month, but it is based on actual expenses, with 50 yuan as the limit. Not long ago, a customs official who lived in a house with a rent of over ten yuan reported 50 yuan. When the Inspector General of Customs found out about it, he ordered his dismissal for exaggerating the report and issued a notice to all customs offices to strictly investigate whether the customs officials' housing allowances were accurate. If there is any exaggeration, they will be immediately punished.

Significant Increase in Japanese Customs Officials

The Shanghai Customs revenue has not been remitted to the central government since July last year. Inspector General of Customs Robert Maze reported this situation to the Ministry of Finance. As for the recent administrative situation of the customs office, there has been a significant increase in the number of Japanese foreign staff. The reason for this is mostly due to the current urgent situation. It is generally believed that this is a temporary special situation and that things will return to normal after some time. As for import and export customs forms, Japanese merchants have recently requested the addition of Japanese. However, the customs authorities have not considered this request because the usual forms are in Chinese and English.

### Japan's Serious Crisis: Financial Situation Nearing Collapse, Hyperinflation, People's Livelihoods Suffering, Production Declining Daily, Foreign Relations Worsening

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 31st] News from New York indicates that Japan's financial difficulties have reached the brink of hyperinflation. This is further substantiated by its new budget reaching a staggering 10 billion yen. The amount of paper money issued by the country in 1923 was 1 billion yen, and recently it has increased to 2 billion yen, while industry and commerce have declined. Military industries have developed abnormally, which is detrimental and harmful to ordinary industry and commerce. Its production is decreasing daily, and the price index is increasing daily. According to statistics released by the Bank of Japan, the retail price index, assuming 1914 as 100, was 194 in August 1937, which increased to 303 in the same month last year. The standard of living in 1937 was 194, which increased to 211 last year. The severity of the crisis is self-evident. Moreover, the new massive budget is bound to exacerbate this crisis. Based on this, the industry and commerce in the areas occupied by Japan in China will inevitably be depressed, and improvement will be even more unattainable. Disputes between Japan and various countries will also become increasingly serious. This can be asserted with certainty.

### Diet General Meeting Questions War Policy: Attitude towards Britain and the United States Becomes Weaker

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 1st] Tokyo dispatch, 31st. The Diet General Meeting's questioning of war policy was quite sharp. First, Erbei, formerly of the Oriental Association and now affiliated with the Minsei Party, asked whether China's friendliness towards Britain and the United States was due to defects in Japan's diplomatic measures. Arita found this difficult to answer. Erbei asked, "Does the cabinet mean that it has no intention of adopting decisive measures towards British and American policies?" Arita replied, "The Konoe statement has already indicated the target, and now is not the time to adopt decisive measures." Kudo, a member of the Seiyukai, asked, "What is the meaning of the Konoe statement not demanding compensation?" Arita replied, "Private losses cannot be ignored." From this exchange, it can be seen that the Konoe statement of not seeking reparations was actually deceptive. Subsequently, Puyama, a member of the Minsei Party, raised questions about the relationship between Japan and the National Government, but the questions and answers on both sides were rehashes of old topics, with no meaning.

### Japan Unable to Sustain War: Considers Convening International Conference

Oyama further raised an important question, saying that Japan, in order to make various countries understand the truth, should convene an international conference in Tokyo, inviting Britain and the United States, and if necessary, Germany and Italy, to jointly discuss the East Asian issue. This proposal has deep meaning, seemingly intending to use the international conference to seek an end to the Sino-Japanese War. Hiranuma replied that there was a need to explain Japan's true intentions, but there were no plans to convene an international conference at this time. Arita also replied that it was doubtful whether convening such an international conference could make third countries understand, and that it would be more effective to have candid talks with the representatives of the countries concerned stationed in Japan. Oyama also asked whether the current cabinet was considering the four principles for resolving the incident that Japan had proposed to China last year through the German ambassador to China. Arita replied that the current cabinet would continue to implement the Konoe cabinet's policy towards China. The debate then ended. This was one of the most exciting scenes of the 31st, and the domestic anxiety about the international situation and the unease caused by the prolonged war were clearly visible.

### British Parliament Reconvenes: Chamberlain Describes Trip, States Close Cooperation between Britain and France

[London, Central News Agency, 1st] The House of Commons, which had been adjourned for the Christmas holiday, reconvened yesterday afternoon. When Prime Minister Chamberlain answered questions from members on the European situation, he said, "There are no new developments to report at this time." There was a thunderous applause throughout the chamber.

[London, Reuters, 1st] Sir Archibald Sinclair, a Liberal member, continued the debate on the government's foreign policy last night, saying that although there was no definite reason for the failure of the government's policy, it could not be trusted in some respects. He said, "We are now expanding our armaments, but we have lost the assistance of some strong armies abroad. A few months ago, we could still rely on the assistance of these armies to resist aggression. At present, we can see geographically that the Rome-Berlin axis crosses Europe, effectively separating Eastern and Western Europe. Britain must show that it is working for freedom and international integrity, which is not shameful or terrible. We want to help the people of Germany, Italy and other countries to build a just and fair world order. Mr. Chamberlain has placed an item on the credit side of peace. In Germany and France, most people see in Chamberlain and his umbrella a symbol of his dignity, patience and tranquility, which is better than the noisy boasting of dictators in totalitarian countries." Greenwood declared, "One hundred and thirty British ships have been attacked by Franco's forces, and Britain's protests have been repeatedly disregarded. Interference in the Spanish war has intensified, and the danger of war lies with two people, namely Hitler and Mussolini." Foreign Secretary Butler replied on behalf of the government, "The French government has stated to Britain that it is willing to provide a large amount of food and shelter to Spanish refugees crossing the French border. Britain has replied that it is willing to provide further assistance if the situation requires it. We have strictly complied with the conditions of non-intervention." The government's motion to suspend the debate on the issue and postpone it was passed by a majority of 258 votes to 133.

[London, Reuters, 1st] British Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the British House of Commons last night on his recent trip, saying that the talks were very frank and open. "This discussion did not hope that either party would accept the other's point of view. Although we dare not say that all points have been agreed, the expected goals have been achieved." He repeatedly stated that the meeting was informal in nature, and said, "Mr. Mussolini has stated in advance that Italy's policy is a policy of peace, and when necessary, he will use his power to promote peace." He also stated that the Berlin-Rome axis is the key to Italy's foreign policy, and we also stated that the close cooperation between Britain and France is the basis of British policy. Chamberlain then mentioned the Mediterranean, saying that Mussolini was very satisfied with the provisions of the Anglo-Italian agreement, and repeatedly stated that he was willing to abide by the obligations stipulated in the agreement. Then they proceeded to discuss the adjustment of the borders between Italian East Africa and Sudan and the adjacent British territories, which was in accordance with the provisions of the Anglo-Italian agreement. The Egyptian government will naturally participate in the negotiations on Sudan at that time. "We expressed regret over the recent deterioration in Franco-Italian relations. We understood from subsequent talks that the biggest problem between France and Italy was the Spanish issue. It is difficult for France and Italy to conduct negotiations until the Spanish war ends." Chamberlain continued, "At the same time, Mussolini solemnly stated that Italy will have no demands on Spain after the end of the Spanish war. Foreign Minister Ciano also repeated his original statement to the British government, that Italy has no territorial ambitions in Spain." Regarding the issue of disarmament, Mussolini advocated adopting inquisitive restrictions when the situation permits. Regarding the development of this issue, both sides agreed to maintain contact at any time. Regarding the Jewish issue, Mussolini believed that this was an internal affair and could not be resolved by one country alone, so it must be resolved by broad measures. Chamberlain then recounted his visit to the Pope, saying, "The Pope was touched by the love of the King and Queen for the British people. This is a special honor that cannot be forgotten. The Pope's courage and kindness are deeply moving." Chamberlain continued, "We have now begun to see the results of long-term military preparations. People from all walks of life have seen that our efforts have greatly increased our national defense strength. Our country's power overseas is higher than ever before, and the need for our friendship is also greater than ever before." Mr. Attlee said that the government's appeasement policy has failed, which is inaccurate, and I also believe that the government's policy has gradually succeeded. I hope that our trip to Italy will enhance the friendship between Britain and Italy, but at the same time, I hope that this trip will not weaken our relationship with France. I also believe that the relationship between Britain and France today is closer than we can remember, and this relationship is based on mutual trust, and this mutual trust can only increase.

[Paris, Reuters, 1st] British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in the House of Commons last night was warmly welcomed in France. Chamberlain emphasized that the British government's policy requires close cooperation between Britain and France. Paris believes that Chamberlain's speech is a great contribution to appeasing the European situation.

### British Prime Minister Answers Attlee: Policy on Spain Remains Unchanged, Italy Will Have No Further Demands After the End of the War, Hitler's Speech Expresses Need for Peace

[London, Reuters, 1st] During the British House of Commons meeting last night, opposition leader Attlee questioned the Spanish issue, saying that when the British Prime Minister spoke of Mussolini's hope for peace, the country was deeply concerned about Mussolini's interference in the Spanish war, which had lasted for a year and a half. If the Prime Minister could observe the course of this incident, he would be able to appreciate a sense of dissatisfaction that was being revealed in the country. The fact that Italy is fiercely attacking the Catalonia line has overturned the promise to do its utmost to reduce the scope of the incident. Most of the troops that entered Barcelona were Italians, and the fall of Barcelona has been hailed as a great Italian victory. The British government's attitude towards the Spanish issue, apart from the Nyon Agreement, is entirely to encourage aggression. In reply to the questions, the Prime Minister said that at present, the injured, the elderly, and women and children, some of whom have broken arms and legs, are crawling across the mountains on the French-Spanish border, and the suffering is unbearable. If the war spreads, the suffering will be unimaginable. The British government is doing its best to save these unfortunate events, and has first issued 20,000 pounds to the International Committee to assist in the rescue of Spanish children. Another 20,000 pounds will be freely disposed of by the committee. If there is still a need, the government will be prepared to provide more assistance quickly. Regarding the issue of contacting the establishment of a safe zone for Spanish refugees, the Prime Minister said that the government has also notified General Franco, asking him to pay special attention to humanity during the fierce fighting in Catalonia. The Prime Minister also pointed out that before the fall of Barcelona, there was general concern that there would be a massacre, but the result was not so, which should be welcomed by all parties. Speaking of general questions about the government's policy, the Prime Minister said that Britain's policy of non-intervention has always been correct, and he is very satisfied with this, so it is naturally impossible to change it at this time. If you want to change the situation in Spain, you must provide large-scale assistance to the Spanish government to engage in intervention. "I believe that the current situation in Spain does not threaten the peace of Europe, but I believe that the most serious thing is that if we abandon the policy of non-intervention and provide large-scale assistance to the Spanish government to carry out intervention, then peace will be threatened. The result of this intervention will inevitably lead to an expansion of the conflict in Europe, which is exactly the opposite of the British government's policy. The British government's policy is to adopt a strict attitude of impartiality. The reason why we refuse to grant Franco the right to belligerent groups is because this war is not only a civil war, and both sides have foreign intervention, so the situation is becoming complicated." Speaking of the opposition party's declaration of distrust of Mussolini and Hitler, Chamberlain said: "If you want to guarantee that someone can fulfill their promise, and tell them that you do not trust what they say, and that you will take action based on their failure to fulfill their promise, this is the worst method. I am sure that Mr. Attlee is wrong. When we were in Italy, Mussolini and Ciano repeatedly assured us that after the end of the war, there would be no demands on Spain. The policy of stability is now gradually succeeding, and the visit to Rome has not weakened the friendship between Britain and France." Speaking of Hitler's speech, Chamberlain said: "I have a clear impression that viewing Hitler's speech, he is not preparing to cause another crisis in Europe. Throughout the entire speech, there were many places where he expressed that Germany needs peace, the same as other countries, but Europe's confidence cannot be quickly established for a while." Chamberlain concluded: "Before we can obtain a final solution, we must first be able to seek to establish a concrete and sincere cooperation, if not common disarmament, we can also mutually restrict each other. If the time comes when we can find the same spirit as us elsewhere, I know that Britain must be prepared to contribute to general stability."

### Thousands of People Demonstrate in London, Demanding Aid to Spain

[London, Reuters, 1st] Yesterday, thousands of people held a rally in the Great War Memorial Square to support Spain, listening to speeches criticizing the government's foreign policy, mostly related to the Spanish issue. Fifty members of the International Brigade who had just returned from Spain also attended the meeting, singing the Internationale. The demonstration marched along Piccadilly Street for an hour, chanting slogans to aid Spain. Traffic was completely blocked. Hundreds of special police were called to suppress the demonstration, and many people were arrested.

### Britain Further Aids China: Parliament is Considering Measures, Chamberlain Says Our Guerrillas are Active

[London, Reuters, 1st] British Secretary of State for India, Lord Zetland, said in a speech in Cambridge yesterday that there is no doubt that the British Parliament will approve credit loans to China, and said that they are considering further ways to aid China.

[London, Reuters, 1st] British Prime Minister Chamberlain said in the House of Commons last night in response to questions about the situation in China that the important developments in the situation in China in recent weeks have been Japan's announcement on December 22 last year of its revised peace terms and the Chinese government's rejection of these terms, and that there have been no major changes on the battlefield, but the Chinese guerrillas in North China are becoming more active, causing interruptions in railway transportation from time to time.

### War Damage Insurance: British Chancellor of the Exchequer Issues Statement, Considering Compensation Measures

[London, Reuters, 1st] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon issued a statement on war damage insurance in the House of Commons last night, saying that the British government's goal is not only to pay attention to those who directly suffer from war damage, but also to be concerned about the general impact on society. The government has been considering compensation measures for those who have suffered from war damage. In terms of property loss, the government has also tried to plan mutual assistance through group insurance methods, but after review, it found that the calculation was very difficult. At the same time, the government is also unwilling for the general society to bear such a huge burden. This does not mean that private property does not need to be protected, but this kind of assistance can only come from post-disaster relief. When property losses are accurately assessed, public funds can be used to provide relief within a possible range. This kind of matter will be handled by the Compensation Committee. People's losses can be registered and requested directly from the National Finance Department.

[London, Central News Agency, 1st] The Ministry of War recently stated that the number of people applying to join the volunteer national service is unusually enthusiastic, exceeding the quota, and the recruitment has been temporarily suspended.

### Palestine Conference: To Begin on the 7th

[London, Reuters, 1st] Someone in the House of Commons last night asked Colonial Secretary MacDonald whether there were any statements to be made regarding the Palestine Conference. MacDonald said that he expected that all representatives would arrive in London as scheduled to participate in the conference to be held on the 7th.

### U.S. Navy Department Considers Opening Deep-Sea Port on Guam: Secretary of the Navy Reports on Defense Issues, Will Decide According to International Situation

[Washington, Associated Press, January 31st] Undersecretary of the Navy Edison told the House Naval Affairs Committee that whether the Navy Department intends to build strong air and naval bases on Guam will be determined by the development of the international situation. At present, the Navy Department is only considering the Vinson proposal, that is, opening a deep-sea port and building the initial equipment for an air base, which requires approximately $5 million. Republican Maas declared that he would propose amending the Vinson proposal, authorizing the Navy Department to strengthen the defense of Guam and build other air bases if necessary.

### Germany and Italy Reaffirm Friendly Relations

[Rome, Central News Agency, 1st] Mussolini recently corresponded with Hitler, reaffirming the friendly relations between Germany and Italy, expressing sincere unity. It is reported that Mussolini decided to put forward his "wishes" for the Mediterranean to France earlier because Hitler declared that Germany would help Italy once the war broke out. Italian officials are currently inciting anti-French sentiments among the public in public. Judging from the current situation, if Mussolini's bloodless victory strategy fails, Italy will definitely take tough measures.

### British and German Business Circles Hold Talks: Chamberlain Expresses Satisfaction

[London, Reuters, 1st] British Prime Minister Chamberlain said in the House of Commons last night in response to questions from Labour MP Henderson that he warmly welcomed the parts of Hitler's speech concerning mutual trust and cooperation between the British and German peoples. "I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the feelings shared by our government and people. I am very pleased that representatives of the British and German business circles have recently held meetings to discuss various commercial issues. Chamberlain also replied to a question about whether the British and German governments intend to establish a treaty soon, saying that there was no such thing.

[Berlin, Reuters, 1st] According to well-informed sources, industrial representatives from Britain and Germany will hold talks in Dusseldorf on the 28th of this month to discuss issues such as the value of machinery and coal.

### America Helps Democratic Countries Resist Authoritarianism: Roosevelt Talks with Senate Military Committee, Considers France as the Boundary of Conflict between Two Groups

[Washington, Associated Press, January 31st] Several members of the Senate Armed Services Committee declared after discussing with President Roosevelt for an hour that President Roosevelt is now closely cooperating with Britain and France to resist the threat of totalitarian countries to the democratic countries of the world. It is said that the committee members discussed the international situation with President Roosevelt, and the President paid great attention to foreign affairs, and told the Military Committee that it is necessary to strengthen the defense of the United States. The members of the committee kept the President's talks secret. According to reliable sources, President Roosevelt discussed the threat to world peace and feared that war could not be avoided forever. A committee member said, "I think President Roosevelt eagerly told us the seriousness of the world situation and told us that we should strengthen national defense without investigating unimportant matters."

### American Newspapers Compete to Report: Shocking News

[New York, Reuters, 1st] Newspapers here are today publishing shocking news about President Roosevelt holding a meeting with several members of the Senate Military Committee. The New York Times said, "Members of the Military Committee said after meeting President Roosevelt that the President will do his best to support democratic countries to resist authoritarianism. It is heard that President Roosevelt has declared to the committee members that France should be regarded as the real boundary of the conflict between democratic countries and authoritarian countries." The "Tribune Forum" said, "There is an understanding between the United States and European democratic countries. It is heard that President Roosevelt has declared, "The leaders of the European democratic countries must know my position." The President's meeting with the Military Committee was to discuss the issue of France ordering a large number of aircraft from the United States. The number of aircraft ordered is the largest in the past 25 years. The committee members all remained silent after meeting with President Roosevelt. It is said that President Roosevelt said that he does not hope to see American troops fighting again on foreign soil, but the United States must do its best to help Britain and France.

### Encourage Foreign Countries to Buy Aircraft from the United States

A committee member said, "The world situation mentioned by President Roosevelt is extremely alarming, so the President declared that the details of his remarks should be kept strictly confidential to avoid shocking the American people." Several other committee members declared, "President Roosevelt said that the sale of aircraft is in line with the foreign policy of the United States. One of the purposes of this policy is to help democratic countries. President Roosevelt told us that he is the commander-in-chief of the US Army and Navy, so he has the right to approve or reject the sale of aircraft, so the Military Committee does not need to inquire about the sale of aircraft to France. The US government will encourage foreign countries to order aircraft from the US in the next two years. However, President Roosevelt declared that there was no detailed explanation of this matter, so it is not yet known whether his remarks on encouraging foreign countries to order aircraft from the US include all foreign governments."

### Canada and the United States Joint Defense

[Vancouver, Haitong News Agency, 1st] According to the Vancouver Daily in Ottawa, the Canadian and American general staffs are currently discussing a joint plan to maintain the Pacific coast defense of Canada and the United States. In the future, the Canadian sea will be protected by the US fleet, and its coastal defense and military strongholds will be the responsibility of the Canadian army. It is heard that the plan will have military roads running through Canada, the United States, and Alaska.

### Short Commentary: The Issue of Sublessor Evictions

Since the war extended to southern China, the population of Hong Kong has increased sharply, and disputes between landlords and tenants have occurred frequently. Therefore, the Legislative Council enacted the "1938 Restriction of Evictions Ordinance." Recently, the situation in China has become more urgent, and the number of people residing in Hong Kong has continued to increase. What is needed in the social environment is only what is stipulated in the above law, and it is still felt to be insufficient. At today's meeting of the Legislative Council to revise various bills, the Attorney General will reportedly make revisions to the Restriction of Evictions Ordinance. This is truly a good policy for the welfare of Hong Kong residents, and it is also the only important task for maintaining social order in Hong Kong.

Thinking deeply, the issue of housing is superficially the relationship between landlords and tenants. In fact, in addition to landlords and tenants, there are also people who profit from it, thereby increasing the suffering of tenants and causing landlords to bear various bad names on their behalf. Who are these people? That is, a portion of those commonly known as sublessors. Subleasing is a long-standing custom, and not all sublessors are people who profit from it, but some of them, under the name of sublessors, illegally act in ways that are detrimental to tenants and cause landlords to suffer on their behalf. Especially for foreigners, due to language barriers, there is often more pressure that is beyond reason. For example, the term "shoe money" and the custom of "lease transfer" can be used to trick tenants into paying money that they should not have to pay by taking advantage of the landlord's premises. In fact, "shoe money" is the money given to the landlord's runner. What the landlord does not need can be falsely presented as a reduction in rent to forcefully take dozens of dollars from the tenant. Lease transfer is a clause that landlords do not usually allow in rental contracts, but they can call it a common practice and transfer the lease at any time, evicting tenants at any time, thereby taking advantage of the situation and profiting endlessly. There are other similar or even worse situations that are difficult to list.

In short, landlord evictions are still known to the public, but sublessor evictions have not received attention. The former has laws to restrict it, but the latter is harmful not only to tenants, but also to landlords, and it has not been heard that there are any laws to sanction it, which is extremely unfair. For the sake of the welfare of the people of Hong Kong society, this is specially put forward for the Legislative Council's reference.

### Success of European Appeasement?

British Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons on the 31st evening, stating that although the Anglo-Italian Roman talks did not achieve any special results, the European appeasement policy had already been successful. He was confident that both Germany and Italy shared a desire for peace. It seems that Chamberlain's policy of compromise and diplomacy has been successful, but what is the reality?

Yes, Chamberlain has succeeded, but what he has succeeded in is not European peace, but only the expansion of war planned by the leaders of the monopoly capital led by [omitted]. The fact is very obvious. After the Rome talks, the Italian invaders were victorious in Spain, and the German invaders reiterated their demands for the division of colonies. The European war crisis has advanced a step, and the opportunity for monopoly capital leaders to profit has increased even more. However, the British and French [omitted] while the forces of democratic peace were further suppressed. Therefore, the success of appeasement is not tranquility, but the mad preparation for a future great war!

In fact, our observation is by no means speculation or arbitrariness. People of vision around the world share the same feeling. Senator King of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee once pointed out that "Hitler and Mussolini have a conspiracy to change the map," but Mr. Chamberlain's so-called "success of appeasement" will be the success of the fascist aggressors in suppressing democracy and peace forces. Furthermore, the leader of the British Liberal Party, Mr. Sinclair, pointed out publicly in the British House of Commons, "Although we A (referring to Britain) are rearming, we are gradually losing the support of important and powerful forces abroad!" This is worthy of prompting the British government to reflect deeply.

### Overview of the Singapore Military Base

— (Original by John Gunther, translated by Hong Sheng)

The construction cost of the Singapore base is indeed considerable. Strangely enough, this huge sum of money all came from [omitted]. According to official estimates, the total cost of the base is US$80.55 million, of which the naval base alone cost US$38.5 million to US$45 million.

The floating dock is valued at US$4.805 million, and the towing fee from [omitted] to Singapore is US$1 million, including the Suez Canal transit tax of US$50,000. The Seletar Air Force base is valued at US$3.55 million, and there are two aircraft [omitted] each valued at US$1.75 million.

However, unofficial estimates are even higher. If the salaries of officers and soldiers and all indirect expenses are included, the cost is no less than US$250 million.

The sources of this money are varied: the Straits Settlements supplied the land for Seletar, valued at US$750,000, New Zealand contributed US$5 million, and Hong Kong contributed US$1.25 million. Australia did not contribute money, but built a navy.

The wealthy Malayan Peninsula above Singapore is divided into two parts, direct and non-direct. The direct part—under the direct jurisdiction of the British headquarters—supplied US$1 million in cash and two Royal Air Force squadrons worth US$1.5 million. The political independence of the non-direct part is no greater than that of the direct part. Among them, the Sultan of Johor supplied US$2.5 million. In total, the above-mentioned contributions totaled US$21 million, accounting for slightly less than a quarter of the total value of the base.

In addition, up to 1933, the Straits Settlements also provided cash of 60 million local currency (one local currency dollar is equal to US$0.58). After 1933, it also contributed a fixed annual contribution of 4 million local currency, plus a special contribution of 1.5 million local currency in the past three years. Therefore, the total contribution of the Straits Settlements to the base is no less than 81.5 million local currency, equivalent to about US$47.5 million.

Adding the cash contributed by the Straits Settlements to the above-mentioned contributions, the total is US$68.5 million. Subtracting this number from the [omitted] value of US$80.55 million, the difference is US$12.05 million, which is paid from the British headquarters' budget. It is really very cheap. Excluding the annual maintenance of US$2.5 million, what the Singapore base asks of the British headquarters is truly minimal.

Twenty percent of the total revenue of the Straits Settlements comes from opium sales. This treasure business is a government monopoly. Britain buys raw opium from Iran or India and processes it into opium paste, which is packaged in small metal tubes. One local currency dollar can buy one Singapore liang (equivalent to one and one-third ounces) of raw opium; while one liang of opium paste costs [omitted] 12 dollars. The interest is considerable, but it also implies prohibition, deliberately raising the price to reduce sales.

The sale of [omitted] is strictly controlled; only registered addicts can purchase it, and those who want to join the addict's [omitted] must have a doctor's certificate.

A few years ago, the government, considering that opium transportation might be prohibited by international [omitted] joint action, promulgated a method of opium subsidy fund, extracting 10% of the annual opium tax for separate safekeeping. This fund has now accumulated to 30 million local currency, and it is no longer necessary to increase it. Therefore, it is said that the [omitted] 35,000 registered smokers simply bear one-fifth of the funds contributed by the Straits Settlements to the base.

On the day the base was completed, the arrival of the U.S. fleet caused panic among many people in the world. In this Sino-Japanese war, the Japanese forces are advancing southward day by day, and the completion of the Singapore base will certainly give Japan a considerable [omitted] color.

Soon, Britain declared again, "If necessary, Britain is prepared to lease all the facilities of the new naval base to the United States for use." In other words, if war breaks out, Britain will reverse and welcome the Americans to Singapore.

On the one hand, the Americans are also happy to do so, because west of Hawaii, she has no [omitted] place to repair large ships. Once something happens in the Far East, the Singapore dock can meet her needs.

According to the most reliable military observation results, the base is only likely to be attacked by the enemy on the mainland directly to the north. A sea attack is simply impossible, and an air raid [omitted] can only damage the base and cannot occupy it. If the enemy attempts to occupy Singapore, they can only land infantry in Malaya or Siam and then advance southward. This is the reason for increasing military airfields in these two places.

The most commendable aspect of Singapore is its location, only 1,578 miles from Manila, only 1,674 miles from Hong Kong, and 3,345 miles from Yokohama. Although Japan is building an important air force base in Taiwan [omitted], if it wants to launch a full-scale naval attack, it must [omitted] add at least 3,000 miles of firepower to be effective, and such a voyage has exceeded the limits that modern expeditionary warships should have.

In fact, the main target of naval warfare is commerce rather than enemy ships. One of the important tasks of the Pacific War is to cut off the transportation of Japanese merchant ships, plus a blockade, which can kill Japan. To achieve this goal, Singapore is the most ideal.

Furthermore, Singapore's neighboring land is an absolutely safe place. It can be said that there is no political activity, such as national movements, in Malaya. Imagine placing a British military base in Egypt, Iraq, or India, where the political situation is a very serious problem. And Singapore has the most perfect air force facilities, which is much more convenient than Gibraltar, which has no good airport.

Therefore, concentrating military power in Singapore has several functions: giving the British Navy a oil depot and repair dock, giving Hong Kong a military backing, and protecting Australia, Colombo, and Calcutta at the same time. It establishes an armored defensive building in the center of the British colony, becoming the hub of Eurasian transportation.

Most importantly, it gives Japan a warning. The base seems to firmly tell Japan that Britain will never give up its commercial interests in this part of the world. Speaking of this, one cannot help but recall a saying by the late Marshal Roberts that one day the history of the world will be decided in Singapore, and perhaps Britain is waiting for that day to come.

### Our Authorities徵集Specialized Personnel to Serve; Specialized Personnel Must Register with the Executive Yuan; Report Duties for War Effort

Since the fall of Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Hankou, our people are scattered everywhere. Specialized talents are especially sparse. Our authorities believe that specialized talents cannot be ignored in this sacred war of resistance. In order to concentrate them for service, the Special Personnel Service Regulations in Extraordinary Times are promulgated. All specialized personnel must register with the designated agency of the Executive Yuan in the following items: (A) name, age, gender, place of origin, and residence; (B) education and experience; (C) if there is a current position, it must be reported so that they can undertake war work.

### The Po Leung Kuk's Third Hospital Begins Accepting Refugee Babies; Dozens Have Already Been Accepted; Donations of Food from All Sectors are Hoped For

Since the Hong Kong branch of the China Wartime Child Care Association obtained the obstetrics room of the old National Hospital from the government as the Association's Third Child Care Hospital, the Association has actively implemented renovations. At the same time, plans have been made to arrange everything. It is now about to be completed. After the hospital is repaired, it will be used to accommodate the existing babies in various hospitals and the refugee babies found in the First Hospital in Yuen Long, totaling about 50. The hospital began accepting admissions this Sunday. There are currently 14 children transferred from the First Hospital in Yuen Long and more than 10 from Kwong Wah Hospital. As for the hospital's expenses, the British Relief Fund now donates HK$500 per month. However, the consumption of babies is exceptionally high. In terms of milk powder alone, each baby needs HK$15 per month. In addition to various other expenses, the hospital is currently in urgent need of baby grains and food. Donations from charitable people in all sectors are hoped for.

### Admiral Noble Leaves the Philippines and Returns to Hong Kong; Expected to Arrive Today

Vice Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, accompanied by his wife and adjutant, departed Hong Kong last month aboard the flagship HMS Kent, traveling south to visit Saigon and Manila. He left the Philippines the other day and returned to Hong Kong. It is expected that he will arrive this morning (2nd). F. Moorey accompanied him on his return.

### Hong Kong to Participate in British and American Exhibitions; Sending Photos of Hong Kong Scenery

For the British Empire Exhibition held in Glasgow, Hong Kong has also sent photos of scenery for display. The cost of Hong Kong's participation in the exhibition is partly borne by the Hong Kong Tourist Association, and the government also subsidizes HK$1,995. In addition, for the World's Fair to be held in New York, Hong Kong will also send photos about Hong Kong's customs and culture for exhibition, with a budget of HK$1,530.

### Double-Decker Buses to be Trial Run in the Short Term

There have been rumors that the Kowloon Motor Bus Company will trial run double-decker buses. According to reliable sources, two such buses will soon appear on London Road. At that time, the traffic department of the police station will monitor the trial run. If it is found that there are trees that hinder the run, they will be cut down. The Hong Kong government authorities will probably not prohibit the trial run of these new vehicles. Judging from the current situation, at most one or two large trees will be cut down. The remaining trees will be slightly pruned. The existing street lighting equipment on various roads is sufficient to provide adequate lighting. As for the recent replacement of street lamps with gas lamps on Nathan Road and other roads by the Hong Kong government, if it is suspected that this is related to the running of double-decker buses, it is not true. This move was decided by the government long ago.

### The China Industrial Cooperative Association Re-establishes its Hong Kong Branch; Invites Prominent Hong Kong Figures to Discuss Progress

Leaders of our country's industrial circles and friendly people who sympathize with our country organized the China Industrial Advancement Cooperative Association in Shanghai a few years ago to revitalize various important light industries in order to solve the unemployment problem of workers in the war zone. At that time, all plans were drafted by the industrial giant Xu Xinliu and submitted to the National Government for adoption. Kong Xiangxi and Madame Song Meiling also enthusiastically assisted in this relief plan. Later, the association moved from Shanghai to Hankou. After the fall of Hankou, it moved to Chongqing to work and established branches in other major domestic cities to assist in the progress. Hong Kong also had this organization. Later, because members went to work in the interior, the Hong Kong association dissolved invisibly. Recently, the association sent a representative, Ms. Ellen, to Hong Kong to re-organize again and sent letters to prominent figures in Hong Kong, holding a symposium at the Gloucester Building Emergency Refugee Relief Association yesterday to discuss all progress matters.

After the success of the Trade Control Commission of the Ministry of Finance of our country in controlling trade, in order to replenish the foreign exchange fund, it specially ordered that the main native products of the country be concentrated in Hong Kong for export. Since the implementation, domestic goods have been handled in accordance with the regulations, transported from the mainland to Hong Kong, and then shipped for export. In the past twelve months last year, mineral ore exports ranked first among the country's goods, with a total value of CN¥80,075,442.

Feature Article

### The Problem of Transporting Stored Rice Northward from Hong Kong

— Jun Ren

[Omitted]. For this reason, the reporter specially visited Yang Yongxiu, chairman of the Rice Merchants' Association, to inquire about and discuss the above-mentioned incident. Mr. Yang analyzed the problem in detail. According to him:

"The operation of rice in Hong Kong roughly has three stages. The first stage is the North-South firms, which are the agencies that directly collect and transport Annam and Siam rice. However, they are only agents. The Annam rice owners have the right to designate the sale to a certain customer, and the North-South firms have no possibility of interfering. After the transaction is completed, the North-South firms deliver the goods for the rice owners, and the task is completed. The profit obtained is a certain amount of commission. The second stage is the Rice Merchants' Association, which can be said to be a group of distributors. They purchase a batch of goods from the North-South firms, break them down into smaller quantities, and distribute them to rice stores for retail. They are limited to Hong Kong and never transport them to other places. The third stage is the Rice Industry Association, which is a group of rice stores. They have even less importance for this issue, because they are only retail rice stores. The number of purchases is not large, and it is no longer possible to transport them in large quantities.

"Now that we understand the situation of the rice industry in Hong Kong, we can review the problem of transporting stored rice northward. The actual responsibility is neither with the Rice Merchants' Association nor with the Rice Industry Association, so is it the responsibility of the North-South firms? But it cannot be said that either. As discussed above, the North-South firms are only agents and have absolutely no ability to choose customers. [Omitted].

"Secondly, there is one more point to note. The Shandong and Tianjin gangs have had decades of historical relations with the North-South firms. Before the war, they constantly transported southern goods such as rice northward and transported northern goods to the south at the same time. This back-and-forth was their business for making a living. For decades, there was no interruption. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the coast was [omitted] blockaded, and the North-South cargo transportation was also affected. There were two periods in the middle when it was suspended. The transactions between the Tianjin and Shandong gangs and the North-South firms were therefore interrupted. Until the end of last year, the War of Resistance entered a new stage. Because of the improvement of the port, the North-South shipping industry gradually recovered. Therefore, the Tianjin and Shandong gangs continued to purchase goods for transportation northward. North-South trade gradually returned to its old appearance. Rice is certainly one of the main goods they purchased. Currently, it may be a fact that Hong Kong rice is being transported northward.

### Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Notifies Overseas Chinese, Denouncing [Omitted] Propaganda and Inducements; [Omitted] Forcefully Induces Overseas Chinese to Return to Live in Occupied Areas; [Omitted].

Since the full-scale War of Resistance, people in the occupied areas have mostly left their homes painfully, unwilling to be refugees. Those who are rich seek safe areas to temporarily reside, and those who are poor are displaced and beg for accommodation and relief everywhere to survive. Therefore, most of the occupied areas are empty, like dead cities. [Omitted] then does not hesitate to make propaganda in an attempt to lure our people to return to live in the occupied areas. In view of this, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission specially issued a fast mail telegram. The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce also received a copy yesterday. The original text is excerpted as follows: (Title omitted) All are aware that according to intelligence, [omitted] recently sent Lieutenant Colonel Sagi Shigeru, a responsible officer stationed in Shanghai of the General Staff Headquarters, to promote to various overseas Chinese, guaranteeing the safety of their families, facilitating communication and remittance, and protecting their Nanyang business to induce them, etc. Since [omitted] invaded our country, they have spared no effort to use all aspects of the military government. Overseas Chinese living in territories cannot be oppressed by violence, and because they are enthusiastic patriots and wealthy, they use false propaganda and use tricks to win them over. This special telegram is sent to denounce and break the conspiracy. As for the statement that "guarantee the safety of their hometown families," wherever [omitted] goes, [omitted], [omitted] is the law. Many of our hometown families of overseas Chinese have been victimized. Now suddenly saying "guarantee the safety of their hometown families" is to use soft means to put our overseas Chinese in the ranks of traitors or submissive people. However, traitors are difficult to be safe. For example, Li Wanyong, who betrayed Korea, and the latter, such as those killed in various places, can be used as a warning for traitors. As for submissive people, those in Korea, Taiwan, Ryukyu, and the four northeastern provinces and occupied areas, [omitted] [omitted] [omitted] [omitted] [omitted] [omitted] [omitted] [omitted] [omitted] Where is the safety? Our overseas Chinese deeply understand the righteousness and vigorously help the War of Resistance. The final victory will surely be liberated. How can they be tempted by this sweet talk to turn against their enemies, betray their motherland, and make their hometown descendants slaves of the country and be slaughtered by [omitted]? As for the statement that "all communication and remittance facilities will be provided," it is even more insidious. Since the outbreak of the war, it has been relatively difficult for overseas Chinese to remit money to their families. However, regarding remittances from overseas Chinese, this association has previously requested the Ministry of Finance to entrust domestic and foreign banks to manage as much as possible, which has been proceeding smoothly for a long time. Why rely on [omitted]? Moreover, [omitted] uses military tickets with no reserve and no value in the occupied areas. If overseas Chinese remittances mistakenly enter [omitted]'s bank, then [omitted] can absorb existing funds and increase foreign exchange financial resources, while what our overseas Chinese hometowns (those in the war zone) get is a military ticket that is said to be empty. It is tantamount to assisting [omitted] with money to invade the motherland and trap their hometowns. As for the statement that "protect their Nanyang business," it is even more ridiculous. Nanyang is not the territory of [omitted]. Overseas Chinese operate here, and they are protected by local laws. They do not need to rely on other countries, nor can they be destroyed by other countries. In short, after the War of Resistance exceeded 17 months, [omitted] suffered huge losses. Under this declining trend, [omitted] does not hesitate to use despicable means to provoke and sow discord in order to achieve their goals. This is a common trick of [omitted], and it is not surprising. It is only feared that overseas Chinese care about their hometowns or may be confused by them and waver in their beliefs. Therefore, this telegram is sent to refute so that our overseas Chinese can understand the truth and see through [omitted]'s conspiracy.

### The Guangdong Provincial Government Allocates 50,000 Yuan to Benefit Refugees; The Funds Were Remitted to the Women's Relief Association Yesterday

The Hong Kong branch of the Chinese Women's Relief Association received a remittance of 50,000 national currency from Madam Wu Jufang, wife of the Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, Li, to be used for purchasing fruit and providing relief to refugees. The original telegram is as follows: "To the Hong Kong Women's Relief Association, on the 29th, we remitted 50,000 national currency from the Provincial Bank to purchase medicines. Please acknowledge receipt by telegram. Wu Jufang." The funds have been received and the Women's Relief Association has already sent a receipt in reply.

### Various Women's Organizations Met Yesterday to Discuss Expanding the Celebration of Women's Day; They Decided to Hold the Event in Different Districts for the Convenience of Women from All Walks of Life; Soong Ching-ling and He Xiangning Will Be Invited to Speak

### The Finance Committee Will Meet Today to Approve an Additional One Million Yuan for Government Expenses; An Additional 150,000 Yuan Will Be Allocated to Tung Wah Hospital

The Finance Committee of the Hong Kong Legislative Council will meet today after the Legislative Council meeting. The Colonial Secretary, Smith, will approve 1,698,573 yuan for government expenses, of which 1,261,126 yuan is the additional amount required to cover the shortfall in items 307 to 330 of last year's expenditure budget. The remaining 437,447 yuan is the additional budget for this year. At the same time, the government intends to allocate unallocated deposits to cover this government expenditure. As of last year, these deposits totaled 890,974 yuan. The Colonial Secretary also pointed out that the Hong Kong government has fixed-term debts that are paid directly by the government and do not need to be allocated from the treasury surplus. This amount totals 312,641 yuan. As for the additional government expenses last year, 60,800 yuan was used by the Health Bureau to purchase a launch, and Kai Tak Airport also spent 6,534 yuan to purchase a launch. The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway suffered considerable damage to its vehicles due to frequent bombings, and the repair costs reached 5,285 yuan. Due to the current situation, the police also incurred an additional 25,000 yuan in expenses, including the cost of accommodating Chinese soldiers. The additional government expenses for this quarter include the cost of refugee camps and losses due to typhoons. Tung Wah Hospital is the largest Chinese charitable organization in Hong Kong, with very large annual expenses. In addition to enthusiastic donations from people from all walks of life in Hong Kong, it also receives a government subsidy of 121,000 yuan. However, due to the Sino-Japanese War, many refugees came to Hong Kong in the past year. Most of them were displaced and in urgent need of relief, so Tung Wah Hospital had to engage in refugee relief work, resulting in huge expenditures. The hospital's medical committee requested the government to increase the subsidy by 150,000 yuan due to insufficient funds. The government considered the amount to be quite large and had to consult the British Colonial Secretary, which has now been approved. The Finance Committee of the Legislative Council will approve this subsidy at today's (2nd) meeting.

Transportation and Travel

### Travel Notes from Chongqing

— Zhang Henshui

A traveler passing through Sichuan, even if just a fleeting glance, will inevitably have two impressions that cannot be erased: one is the river, and the other is the fog. A boat passing through Yichang is like an ant threading a bead, searching for a path in the mountain crevices all day long. Arriving directly at Chongqing, the terrain remains the same. In winter, the river water recedes, and the Yangtze River becomes a line, deeply sunken at the bottom of the mountains, while the two banks become even steeper. Those who have not left the Kui Gate may not believe in the vastness of the downstream Yangtze River.

Chongqing's terrain is like a peninsula, with a range of mountains between the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers. South of the Yangtze River, people live along the mountains, in villages and settlements, connected intermittently, collectively known as the South Bank. North of the Jialing River, a city sits high on the ridge, facing Chongqing, which is Jiangbei County. When travelers come west by boat, they only see mountain light on all sides and city shadows on three sides, misty and hazy, and they do not know where Chongqing is. Some think that Chongqing's terrain is like a concrete and miniature version of the three towns of Wuhan, but in fact, Wuhan is grand, and the mountains and rivers of Chongqing are also majestic, and it is certainly not a miniature version.

Chongqing is built on mountains, and the streets are extremely intricate. The old streets and alleys have high and low slopes, making walking frequently up and down. The new streets are grand and winding, making walking time-consuming. Therefore, when people from downstream arrive here, asking for directions and visiting friends is initially uncomfortable. However, in places like Douyou Street, Huixian Bridge, and Xiaoliangzi, there are tall buildings lining the streets, reaching five or six stories, with asphalt roads circling below like belts, and pedestrians gathering like ants, which also resembles a modern city.

Here, land prices are not high, but the terrain is rugged and cannot be expanded. Therefore, builders build houses from high to low, cutting mountains to make slopes, living in low places facing high places, or building pavilions on the cliffs. Since the plane cannot be expanded, they engage in stacking houses up and down. It is well known that houses are stacked upward into floors and pavilions. Stacking downward is a unique architecture in Sichuan. The method is either to build houses along the slope, gradually sloping down, or to build suspended pavilions at the bottom of the slope, with two or three floors of buildings above to extend beyond the ground. Therefore, in other places, you must go downstairs to go out, but here, you must go upstairs to go out, which is also common. Those who suddenly see this type of building are not surprised. I still remember visiting a friend once, the vermilion door in front of the house had beast rings, looking like a wealthy family. When the door was opened, it was empty and without anything, allowing you to see the white clouds. Looking down, there were twenty or thirty steps down to the courtyard, standing at the door, viewing the roof tiles as if they were in your palm. Isn't that interesting?

Building floors is common in Sichuan, but the cost is surprisingly low. Steel and cement construction is rare, and even brick walls with solid foundations are not easy to find. Most of them are made of wood frames and bamboo walls. When a guest goes upstairs, the whole house moves. Ordinary people who have lived here for generations are not surprised. Moreover, shops on the main streets are ten zhang high, with bright window decorations and a variety of goods. Looking at the exterior, they look like Shanghai and Wuhan. However, when you knock on the walls, they sound like drums, because they are made of brick columns, with double layers of wooden strips nailed between the two columns as partition walls. The partition walls are plastered with mud, making the walls about a foot thick, but in fact, they are hollow and cannot withstand punches. Nearby merchants may not feel that it is inappropriate and intend to improve, but renovating the entire city is not easy to say.

Travelers in Sichuan say that Chengdu is like a small Beiping, and Chongqing is like a small Shanghai. In terms of human feelings and customs, it is generally close to the truth. However, because Chongqing follows Shanghai, the city is located among overlapping mountains and ridges, without any forest and spring arrangements. Guests who want to take a suburban tour should cross the river to Haitangxi (the first station of the Southwest Highway) and then take a long-distance bus for fifteen kilometers to Nan Hot Springs for a day trip. The hot springs are abbreviated as Nanquan, and commonly known as Nanwentang. Near the station, you can find a clear stream between the two mountains, with a gentle breeze and calm water. Slowly advance in a small boat in the creek for five or six miles to reach the marketplace (in Sichuan, townships are called marketplaces, so going to the market is called "going to the marketplace"). There is a park, a youth association hotel, and a restaurant in the marketplace, just like a city. The springs are stored as swimming pools, and tickets are sold separately. There are also small bathrooms that release water at certain times to allow travelers to take a bath. The temperature of the spring is slightly higher than the temperature of our skin. Washing away the dust and relaxing the heart. Generally speaking, the best hot springs are those with small peaks on either side, with a shallow valley in the middle, which is not bad. However, the marketplace buildings are scattered and need special organization.

There is a park in the urban area, which is built on part of a high slope. Although some flowers and trees are planted, with pavilions and kiosks, the location is in the bustling city, without any twists and turns. Except for sipping tea in the long pavilion tea house and overlooking the Yangtze River, it is not worth mentioning. Those who live in Chongqing and want to be close to nature should go out of the new urban area, north past Shangqing Temple, and go forward along the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, walking a small step up Guanshan waist. This place is the neck of the peninsula. The green peaks are towering, and the forests are lush. The Jialing River meanders and lies hundreds of feet below the road. White sails are like feathers, disappearing into the mountain crevices, creating a deep sense of painting. I once came here with a friend in late spring. At that time, the smoke cleared and the sun rose, and I saw the peaks on either side of the river, surrounded by overlapping layers. I did not know where the river came from. The difficulty of the Sichuan road can be seen here. There are many cuckoos in Sichuan, and the green leaves are deep, with chaotic cries throughout the mountains. I climbed the branches and looked east at the river, thinking of the Tang people's poem, "Frequently sending two lines of tears to the flow towards the old garden," and discussed it with my friend.

Futu Pass refers to the top of the mountain. There used to be a tower, but it is gone. Climbing the mountain, the Yangtze River is on the left and the Jialing River is on the right. The two rivers are like double jade belts, surrounding the mountains. You can see everything clearly. Looking around, the cloud peaks and misty ridges make people feel that the mountains and rivers are vast. Someone built a garden on the side of the peak, with a slight arrangement of hills and valleys, and you can visit after submitting a name card.

If you live in Chongqing and want to visit and explore, you must go a long way, or at least cross the river to the south. In the second and third months of spring, peach and plum blossoms bloom all over the mountains, so it is appropriate to travel in the Nanshan Mountains. In summer, the trees are shady, and you can visit Laojun Cave. However, the author's mood is bleak, and he has repeatedly mentioned travel but has been repeatedly stopped. I am ashamed that I have nothing to tell the readers. Beipei in eastern Sichuan is like the West Lake in Zhejiang. Those who come to Chongqing must take a trip to it. I have repeatedly violated my friends' appointments, only reducing the elegance of the trip, let alone climbing Mount Emei and Qingcheng Mountain in the distance.

The climate in Sichuan is mild, and there is no severe cold in winter. Therefore, the phoenix trees turn yellow late, and the elms and poplars sprout early. Chengdu is known as the Hibiscus City, and Chongqing also has all kinds of flowers. There are three or four flower markets in the mountain city, with red and purple flowers displayed daily for guests to choose from. Moreover, the flower prices are extremely low. A handful of roses is only a dime, and a large branch of sweet osmanthus only costs a few cents. Peonies, jasmine, and white orchids are also willing to sell branches, which is not available elsewhere. When the author was writing this manuscript, there were five or six bottles of chrysanthemums in the room, with various good varieties such as lotus petals and crab claws, costing only two or three dimes. A bottle on the desk is even supplied with daffodils. This is something that Jiangbei flower lovers have not even dreamed of.

Some people say that Guiyang is full of black smoke and miasma, and Chongqing is dark and sunless. This is a joke, but it is also a fact. According to the author's experience in Sichuan, the fog and miasma season generally begins in November of the lunar calendar and gradually clears up in March of the following year. Even when it is clear, it is still rainy from time to time and cannot be sunny for long. If you are not accustomed to traveling for a long time, and suddenly enter Sichuan, it will be difficult to maintain your health for a long time. During the fog season, there is no sunlight during the day and no stars and moon at night. The sky is dark gray, and you cannot distinguish the time of day. In the morning and evening, there is even more wet fog, with clouds and fog filling the air, so that you cannot see anything a few feet away. Therefore, the spring night moon and the winter sunrise are rarely seen by the people of Sichuan. Also, there are no strong winds here, and there is little frost and snow. The vegetation is lush, probably because of this.

People only know that the people of Sichuan like spicy food, but they do not know that the people of Sichuan also like sweets. In addition to teahouses and taverns, there are also sweet food shops here, specializing in selling jujube cakes and other foods. In particular, sesame rice balls in chicken oil are very popular. Some say that in the past, before the opium ban was implemented, this was provided for addicts. However, observing the banquets of Chongqing people, there are always many sweets, so the above statement may not be entirely true. There is a dish called "sandwiched meat," which is made by cutting fatty meat into slices and sandwiching them with mashed beans until they are cooked. It is then eaten with heavy sugar, which makes people feel greasy, but the people of Chongqing regard it as a treasure. This is also evidence of a love for sweets. As for rice, it must be served with peppers, which is a common phenomenon. I also like spicy food and follow the people of Sichuan closely. However, when the people of Sichuan formally entertain guests, spicy dishes are not served. People from Jiangnan who have an appointment with the people of Sichuan do not need to fear peppers and ginger.

Sichuan is known to the world as the "Land of Abundance." However, in recent years, times have changed, and wealth is in the upper class. Therefore, more than ten miles around the new urban area are filled with red buildings and green railings, mixed with mountain peaks, bamboo, and trees. Going out of Tongyuan Gate to Shangqing Temple is like going on the Shanxi Road of Nanjing. I have often knocked on the doors of the mansions, and the sophistication of the architecture and the completeness of the equipment is something that even the homes of Shanghai expatriates may not have. If a newcomer is unfortunate enough to land at Linjiangmen and see bamboo walls and wooden houses, with ordinary people and chickens and pigeons gathered there.

Guangdong people call people from other provinces "Waijiang Lao" (outer river folks), while Sichuan people call people from other provinces "Xiajiang Ren" (lower river people). If a person cannot speak Western Mandarin (Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou), even if they come from Gansu and Qinghai, they are still in the ranks of Xiajiang people. A Sichuan proverb says that "lower" is called "the soles of the feet," so people from Xiajiang are commonly called "people from under the soles of the feet." If a guest does not know the reason and suddenly hears this, they will surely turn pale with anger. Their customs are like this, so there is no intention of insulting. Since October of last year, people from under the feet and goods from under the feet have filled the markets of Chongqing. The shop signs are displayed, not written with Nanjing, but with Shanghai. In the fifth branch of Xiaobu, Northern and Southern dialects can be heard in abundance. Since the power of the guests has shifted, the distinction between Upper and Lower Rivers is probably not easy to maintain.

Sichuan cuisine is famous in the country, and is comparable to Cantonese cuisine. In recent years, in Northern and Southern cities, Sichuan restaurants have sprung up everywhere, and their prosperity is evident. However, in Chongqing, pure Sichuan restaurants have dim business and are not worth mentioning. The only ones that can still be regarded as a benchmark are the chefs who have returned to Sichuan from Beijing and Shanghai, using "Xiajiang Sichuan cuisine" as their banner. Then we realize that the Sichuan cuisine we tasted outside the door was not true Sichuan cuisine. There are many large and small restaurants in Chongqing, almost one building every five steps and one pavilion every ten steps. After the influx of guest people, Tianjin, Beijing, Jiangsu, and Guangdong restaurants have sprung up like bamboo shoots, and they seem to be everywhere. Generally speaking, Northern flavors are the most popular, followed by Cantonese flavors, and then Beijing and Jiangsu restaurants. If the managers are good at running the business, the business is not bad. The reasons are as follows: The crown gathers, and banquets are difficult to avoid, one reason. Half of the people who come to Sichuan have no family members, and they regard restaurants as their family kitchens, two reasons. The thought of hometown flavors is something that everyone has, and guests often dine a few days a week to enjoy the flavors of their hometown, three reasons. Local ingredients are used, and the facilities are easy to set up, four reasons. As for Western food, there are no concessions in Chongqing, and prices are restricted, so the price of meals cannot exceed one yuan. Therefore, the restaurant reduces the amount to two dishes and one soup, and the bread is limited to one slice. Even if people like knives and forks, they cannot fill their stomachs with each set, so they leave disappointedly. If you add dishes when eating, the price is also very expensive, and it is not a necessity, so this industry is not thriving.

Chongqing's bathhouses are simple and not as good as those in the Lower River, but they have three characteristics that can be talked about: (1) Every bathhouse has family rooms. It is right to bring your family to bathe together, and it is not forbidden to call prostitutes and joke. (2) There are bathhouses on boats on the river, which also sell seats of different grades. The author heard that it was not very clear, so he did not try to go. However, imagining boiling water on the river, although very convenient, and the awnings are cramped, it should not be very comfortable. (3) The hostels here also run bathhouses. The family rooms are charged by the hour, regardless of the number of people, which is also a wonder.

There are various vehicles for getting around outside the city, such as horses and sedan chairs for long distances, and sedan chairs are used in the urban area. Sedan chairs are convenient for going up and down slopes. They are made of two bamboo poles with a small bamboo seat. The quality is very light, and the carriers are also different from other places. The front is short and the back is long. The sedan chair is shaped like a chair, with bamboo strips clamping a bamboo piece to form a curtain. The curtain is concave at the bottom, just enough to sit on. The seat is covered with bedding, like a rope bed. Bamboo branches are supported on the pole and covered with a cloth tent. People lie half in it, without moving their center of gravity, which is very comfortable. In the northwest of Sichuan, in the basin, there are also small two-wheeled carts. The method of making them is very ancient. When walking, the passenger is in front and the pusher is behind, resembling the objects in Zhong Jinshi's "Marrying a Sister" picture.

People in Sichuan, regardless of men or women, like to wrap their heads with white cloth. The method of wrapping is very simple. The fine cloth is like a huge rope, placing a circle on the head. If it is newly made, it looks like people in the Lower River are in mourning. When asked why, they answer that they fear the wind and cold on their heads. When asked why they don't wear hats, they answer that wrapping cloth is cheaper. In fact, the price of cloth and hats is not very different. The people of Sichuan fear the cold on their heads, but they fear the heat on their feet. Men of the middle and lower classes often go barefoot in straw sandals. In the cold winter, they wear long robes and walk around the market with bare feet, and no one finds it strange. The road in Sichuan is difficult, and the people love to wear straw sandals, which is natural. However, the old habits of the people of China most forbid white on the head, but the people of Sichuan wrap white cloth, and Lu Fangweng has already expressed it in his poems. I don't know when it started, but it is uniquely opposed to the customs of the whole country.

Sichuan opera is also unique in the opera industry. The words and sentences emphasize the elegance of the words. Looking at the script, there are allusions on the paper, similar to Cantonese opera. However, when performing on stage, the singers freely express their tunes according to their roles, without silk and string accompaniment. At the end, the musical instruments play together loudly. More than ten people in the orchestra shout loudly and sing in unison. If you are not used to hearing it, you may feel uneasy. Is this what is meant by "the lower class people and those who harmonize with them are few"? The performances are delicate, and there are also things that Peking opera has not reached. In general, the tragedies are full of tears, and the comedies are extremely obscene. The actors in the drama are outstanding in their roles and are willing to describe them to the extreme. Travelers who have a fondness for Sichuan opera are definitely not seeking singing, but can use words to express it.

Mountain areas like Guizhou are full of stones everywhere, which are barren. Plateaus like Gansu have clay that has no bones, and there is no water source, so they are just vast. Only the mountains of Sichuan have stone below and soil above. Forests are planted in high places, and grains are planted in low places, with not an inch of waste land. The climate is mild, and there can be three or four harvests a year. As for fruits, Chongqing has both pears in the north and lychees in the south, and they are available very early. I tasted cherries in March and chewed olives in August. The oranges and pomelos are especially good. The Guanggan is no different from the Florida oranges sold in Shanghai in terms of color, taste, and smell. After months of storage, you can buy two hundred for one yuan. If the people of the Lower River had known that there was such a good fruit in the country, they would have already taken the place of American oranges.

Literary people are like young girls, good at feeling sentimental, especially when traveling. When writing this article, I wrote it at random, and I couldn't help but express my feelings. After reading it once, I threw it away. What the readers see today is probably five or six out of ten in a mess. Fortunately, the memories are random, forming paragraphs by themselves, and I don't feel that there is any division. One day, when I return to Jiangnan, I will pass through Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Guangdong, and I will definitely contribute more to the readers. What I have not said today, I may be able to make up for it in the future. The mountains and rivers are far apart, and I miss my friends. The year is coming to an end, and I wish you all the best.

Evening of November 20th, 27th year, thick fog covers the mountains, and cold rain brews in the window. Written under the lamp in the Zaozilan Villa.

—Shipping News—

The "Hong Kong Sea Dragon" wooden boat, which caused a sensation, has been docked at Kowloon Wharf No. 1 Bridge from the Bailey Shipyard for ten days. It was originally planned to depart for the United States on Saturday, but due to various unfinished procedures, it has not been able to leave. When test sailing the day before yesterday, a Western crew member accidentally injured his foot and was taken to Kowloon Hospital for treatment. Therefore, the departure date is still uncertain. It is reported that two Chinese crew members are needed on the day of departure and they are being sought. As for the structure of the boat, there is nothing special about it, just like the so-called "big eye chicken" boats in Hong Kong, except that the decorations are more luxurious and it has an extra engine. The strangest thing is that the boat is fully equipped with everything, such as shrines and Buddha statues, filled with superstitious colors. On the day of its trial voyage, a Taoist priest was hired to perform a "prosperous boat" ritual, burning incense and chanting incantations. While the priest chanted, the Western crew members bowed in place of prostrations, obeying the priest's instructions. Onlookers couldn't help but laugh.

The "Jiaotong" ship of the Taisheng Company sailed out of the dock yesterday and will depart for Macau every day at 2:30 AM, returning to Hong Kong at 3:30 AM the next morning. Its sister ship "Haojiang" is undergoing repairs in the dock.

The "Sihua Hualuli" ship, represented by the Prince Company, arrived in Hong Kong this morning from Ballaney in South Africa, but it did not transport any goods. It is here for repairs at the Kowloon Dock.

The "Maosheng" ship of Jardine Matheson is currently under repair at the Kowloon Dock and will be completed soon. It will depart for Sandakan on the 11th of this month.

### Shanghai Sports Community Commemorates "January 28th" Incident, All Competitions Suspended for One Day, Expresses Serious Sentiments, and Issues a Letter to the Sports Community

(Shanghai Correspondent) On the seventh anniversary of the "January 28th" Shanghai Battle, all sports competitions in the city's Chinese sports community, such as the Private Shanghai Middle School Cup small ball game and the China Cup table tennis game, were suspended. The second match of the China-West Charity Basketball Game, originally scheduled to be held that evening, was changed to February 2nd due to the Shanghai Battle Memorial. In addition, the Women's Table Tennis Championship was inaugurated one day earlier due to the "January 28th" incident. All table tennis teams affiliated with the Shanghai Table Tennis Association fasted for one day to mark the commemoration. Various sports organizations also issued an article on the feelings about the "January 28th" commemoration and the understanding that the sports community should have in the future. It briefly stated that on the seventh anniversary of the Shanghai Battle, we deeply feel that the city's sports community should have a more thorough and further understanding of the War of Resistance, and be able to indirectly or directly enhance our strength in the War of Resistance. (1) Hold or participate in more difficult relief competitions. (2) Universally promote sports to make citizens physically fit. (3) Guide decadent youth to turn to the path of sports. (4) Strictly prevent traitorous activities in the sports community. (5) Shatter the dream of the "Sports Injury Association". All of these, it is deeply hoped that people in the sports community will rise up and shoulder the responsibility, and the future of the nation deeply relies on it.

### Hong Kong Inter-City Football Team, Ideal Representatives in the Eyes of Foreigners, Remy Dee is Considered Worthy of the Right Inside Forward Position

(Our Special News) Recently, Hong Kong fans have been concerned about the selection of representatives for the Hong Kong-Philippines inter-city football competition. Yesterday, I read an article in the Western Evening News by the sports reporter with the pen name "Abe," who also proposed a lineup. The intention is probably that since there is not much time left before the inter-city competition, even if the Football Association already has a plan for the selection of personnel, it is not as good as announcing it as soon as possible so that joint trial matches can be held as soon as possible to achieve the effect of communication. According to the lineup he proposed:

Tan Jun'gan (South China Chinese)

Li Tiansheng (South China Southern) Remy Dee (St. Joseph's)

Shi Dilu (Navy Team) Biludu (St. Joseph's) Di Chen (Navy Team) Liang Rongzhao (South China Southern)

Hou Chengtu (Oriental Club) Gaoshan (St. Joseph's) Li Huitang (South China Southern) Feng Jingxiang (South China Southern) Deng Guangsen (South China Southern)

The reason for selecting this team is roughly that although there are still good goalkeepers in Hong Kong, such as Heli, Bao Jiaping, and Heather of the Navy, in his observation, these two are not as stable and reliable as Tan. Li Dasheng's position as left inside forward is beyond doubt, but with Watson not available, Remy Dee is the only other person who can fill that position. Mai Shaohan is used to cooperating with Li, but not as good as Remy's footwork. As for the center backs, Liang Rongzhao, Biludu, and Di Chen are all good, but Liang can fill the right forward position, so it is recommended that Liang play on the right and either Bi or Di play in the center. The left forward is believed to be none other than Shi Dilu. The use of Li, Feng, and Gao as the three inside forwards is the unanimous choice of everyone. As for Hou Chengtu, although he is often suspected of committing offside violations to hinder the overall attacking power, looking around at the left wing in Hong Kong today, there is no one as fast and good at dribbling and shooting as him. Luo Douwen has had excellent performances before, but he seems to be degenerating, so Hou is recommended instead of Luo. Deng Guangsen is recommended for the right wing because he has been performing well recently and is very capable of cooperating with Feng Jingxiang. (Fei Ersheng)

### Shanghai Student Tennis Team's Recent Activities

(Our Correspondent) The Shanghai student tennis team, including Tang Baojia and Li Guofan, went to the Kowloon Cricket Club yesterday afternoon for practice. Finzha and Gesituo accompanied them, playing one doubles match and two singles matches. Because it was a practice, there were no records. However, most of the spectators praised Tang and others for their extraordinary skills.

Today at 4 pm, they plan to practice with Dezi and Piasi at the Hong Kong Cricket Club. However, Defu must give a definite reply at 9 am today. If Defu does not have space today, they will meet tomorrow instead.

Li and others have been practicing hard for the past few days. If they have practice today, they will rest tomorrow to regain their energy and prepare for the battle against the University of Hong Kong the day after tomorrow. If they practice tomorrow, they will rest today. (Dong Lang)

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment... Wild Country Scenery

South Riding

British films have made great progress in recent years. Like "Drums Along the Mohawk," which was screened in Hong Kong on New Year's Day, and this film, are excellent examples. "Wild Country Scenery" is a famous literary work. The author, Winifred Holtby, was a writer who cared very much about social and political issues. The film depicts a typical English village, where there are stubborn and luxurious landowners who are gradually declining, and villagers suffering from poverty and disease, as well as a large number of children who have no opportunity to be educated, living in dirty and unsanitary places. The film also depicts a group of people who are devoted to social causes, how they work hard to transform the village, and at the same time expose the hypocrisy of those who only talk nicely, but are unable to take responsibility for their own actions.

The main actors, such as Anna Neagle and Ralph Richardson, also gave excellent and refined performances. The other actors also had considerable achievements.

Queen... Death Ray Explosion Machine

Arrest Bulldog Drummond

There have been several films about special detectives before, but each has an independent story. Now, in this "Death Ray Explosion Machine," except for H.E. Warner replacing John Barrymore, there are not many changes in the cast. Among all the Bulldog Drummond detective films, this one has a more tortuous and thrilling story. The story depicts Bulldog Drummond on the eve of his wedding, when a professor who is also his friend is assassinated. The professor is an inventor who is working on the invention of a death ray explosion machine. Drummond, eager to avenge his friend and concerned about national defense, tries hard to track down the enemy, goes through all kinds of dangers, and finally catches the villains in one fell swoop.

The plot of the whole film is tense and lively. John Howard plays the detective with vigor. The acting skills of the other actors are also unique.

Peace... The Secret History of a Young Widow

That Certain Woman

It is a work in which Bette Davis and Henry Fonda cooperated again after "That Certain Woman." This film is now being shown for the second time in Hong Kong.

The story tells a sad story. Bette plays a widowed woman who works. She falls in love with a man, but because the man's father strongly opposes it, the marriage cannot be completed, but unfortunately she is pregnant. Soon she gives birth to a child. Later, the man marries another woman in Paris. Then the woman injures her leg and becomes disabled. At the same time, out of sympathy for her husband and the child born to the widow, she sacrifices her love and lets them reconcile forever.

The tragic atmosphere of the whole film is quite strong. Several climaxes also have the power to manipulate the audience's emotions. Bette Davis plays a widow who is heavily oppressed by the social environment, and gives a profound and moving performance. Henry Fonda is also very competent.

Oriental... True Love Between Mother and Son

Of Human Hearts

It depicts a family tragedy. The father is a clergyman who sacrifices everything for religion, but his son opposes this work, thinking that being a doctor is more practical than being a priest. So after a fierce argument, the son leaves home to study medicine. Later, the old father dies, and the mother sacrifices everything for her son's education expenses. By the time he graduates, the civil war breaks out. The relief work makes him feel very interested. Because he felt that the family had left him with a bad impression, he forgot his old mother. It was not until someone criticized him that he felt ashamed and returned to his mother's arms.

The whole film is very tragic. Although this film is not a war film, the scenes of war and rescue are also quite spectacular. Several of the main actors seem a bit unfamiliar to us, but their performances do not disappoint.

Dahua... The Wise Judge

Judge Hardy's Children

The structure of the story is no different from "You Can't Take It With You." It writes that Hardy was called back to the capital by the government to preside over affairs, so the family moved from the countryside to Washington. Unfortunately, Hardy was deceived by a friend, and his daughter, Mary, was almost misled by vanity and deceived by someone. His son, Andrew, also has a very humorous romance. In the end, he returns to his hometown and lives a free life.

Director George Seitz handles this ordinary educational story with very delicate techniques, and the characters are vividly portrayed on the screen. And some of the interjections and dialogues in it make the audience feel particularly interested. In terms of actors, the most successful is Mickey Rooney. Cecilia Parker is also very cute. The other supporting roles are all competent.

New World... Women's World

Cantonese film

The plot describes the story of a group of female boarders in a women's apartment. This apartment contains all kinds of characters. They all have their own occupations, but they are complicated. Among them are female students, female reporters, female saleswomen, singers, female dancers... The careers of all urban women are almost completely included here. The women are gossiping, and they all have their own experiences. It is no exaggeration to say that she is a microcosm of women in the city. However, because the plot of the whole drama lacks the contrast of men, it seems very lax and forced, and cannot arouse the audience's interest. At the same time, this film can only depict the ordinary private lives of ordinary women, such as quarrels over rouge and powder, but it has never written about the description of women in general. This is really the only reason for the failure of this film. In the end, because the apartment was bombed, all the women realized it and united to go to the front line, which also seemed unnatural and formulaic. However, even though that's how it is said, we have to forgive the writers and directors for making a play with all women, which is also a very difficult thing.

Central... Sequel to Golden Chrysanthemum

Cantonese film

The audience who has seen the previous episode will always remember that at the end, Zhou Zhicheng still stole a pair of Golden Chrysanthemums. Now, the sequel starts from this incident and ends when the Golden Chrysanthemums are returned. The plot is not as tense and tortuous as the previous episode, and the performance is also very lax, but there are still many places in the middle that can win the tears of some stupid audiences, such as Kuang Shanxiao being framed and imprisoned, and Xiao Yanfei visiting the prison. The consistent style of folk stories is still unavoidable. We don't need to see it to guess the plot of the film. Sure enough, this ideal is not wrong. Cao Qiwen is not suitable for acting in this kind of film. The scenery and photography are okay in South China, but the sound recording is a failure.

### Beware of Smokescreens

— Lin Huanping

Recently, two rather bizarre pieces of news have emerged in international affairs:

First, German staff officers praised the power of the Soviet Red Army.

Second, unofficial German propaganda touted the improvement of Soviet-German relations, claiming the Anti-Comintern Pact would become a scrap of paper. Are these credible?

Our observation is as follows:

First, Germany has consistently warned its ally Japan not to exhaust its military strength in China, so as not to weaken the anti-Soviet forces, which is in line with the spirit of the Anti-Comintern Pact. The Japanese military insisted on going its own way, deeply penetrating our inland areas and engaging in long-term warfare. Germany is very likely using this as a veiled warning.

Second, after the Munich Agreement, relations between the Soviet Union and small countries in Southeastern Europe, especially with Poland and Romania, became increasingly close. Germany is very likely feigning friendliness with the Soviet Union to carry out activities of division and disintegration.

Third, the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact has recently been brought up again, saying it is still valid. At the same time, the anti-fascist wave among governments and the masses in various democratic countries is intensifying. Germany is very likely releasing this kind of air to ease the anti-fascist wave.

Fourth, the astonishing actions of the three aggressors of Germany, Japan, and Italy in the near future have become a widely shared perception. Japanese envoys to various European countries have recently been frequently meeting in Paris, attempting to turn the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance. Isn't it possible that Germany's move is also a smokescreen?

Fifth, it is also possible that it is a diplomatic trick orchestrated by Japanese warlords, because after the Wang Jingwei faction, which advocated taking the anti-communist route and following the German-Italian route, was purged, the Japanese warlords said that the Chinese government was completely pro-Soviet and anti-German-Italian. However, now that the Soviet Union is also "seeing Germany," aren't the views of the Wang Jingwei types correct? In fact, such a conspiracy will never work. (But it is necessary to guard against elements using anti-communism as a cover to swagger and deceive!)

Sixth, Germany wants to invade Ukraine. Germany knows about the intense popular sentiment in the Soviet Union. Therefore, Germany's move may also be a smokescreen to suppress Soviet morale.

The above is about the German side.

As for the Soviet Union, its national foundation is as solid as a rock. It does not fear invasion by others, whether from the East or the West. As Defense Commissar Voroshilov said, we will certainly eliminate the invaders in other people's territory. The Zhanggufeng Incident has proven this statement. But it has consistently adopted a policy of peace, and the spirit of this policy is the same for democratic countries and fascist countries: to eliminate war. Therefore, it also maintains diplomatic relations and trade relations with Germany, Italy, and Japan, and has even proposed to Japan to conclude a non-aggression treaty. However, to say that the Soviet Union's policy is a compromise, and that socialism is almost the same as Nazism and Fascism, is simply a joke and extremely absurd. The Soviet Union is the most sincere advocate of world peace, and the most sincere aid to oppressed nations in their struggle for liberation. If Nazi Germany is really interested in improving Soviet-German relations, the Soviet Union will certainly be happy to accept it. But if it uses this mask to carry out some kind of conspiracy, the shrewd and capable politicians of the Soviet Union will never take the bait. This point, I am afraid, the invaders themselves understand better than we do.

After the sudden change in the Western War, a sudden atmosphere of Soviet-German amity appeared, and Hitler's important speech in the Reichstag on the 30th of last month, in which he "decided the fate of the world," clearly expressed demands for colonies, supported Italy's future aggressive actions, and supported Japan's position on invading China. Then, isn't "Sima Zhao's heart" "known to everyone"?

### Lost Lambs

— Shuoyan

On a cold winter night, there was not a single cloud in the sky. A bright moon, lined with a few scattered stars, shone down lonely and coldly, hypnotizing everything into dreamland. The roads and rooftops were all dyed a silver-white, and the night was very quiet.

The biting cold wind howled, and the clear sound of the bells from a distant church aroused the feelings of the wanderers. A group of lost lambs, their lives like grains of sand in a storm, like duckweed on the vast sea, forever drifting in the wind and in the water!

On the unfamiliar roads of a foreign land, all the faces are strangers, and the homeland shattered by artillery fire is often recalled as a sad dream!

Where is the final resting place for wanderers?

When will the life of escape come to an end?

Tearful sadness is hidden in the old man's eyes!

The children cry with hunger, stroking their empty stomachs with their small hands!

In the homeland, in that green countryside, there is a quiet river, flowing gurglingly. Many delicate willows grow by the river, swaying in the breeze. This natural picture is linked to my unforgettable memories. Now, now! The iron hooves of the invaders have trampled on the green fields, and the neighing of warhorses has shattered the peaceful dreams of thousands of families. Under the remains of artillery fire, only a scene of sorrow and desolation is left.

The sky above the wilderness is empty, hiding a group of lost lambs. They have no delicate gold velvet blankets, heron down quilts, or elastic "sofa" beds. They only have a "genuine" burlap sack and a few scraps of old newspaper. They fall asleep under the urge of fatigue. The blue sky is their tent, and the straw thatch is their bed. The howling of the north wind is considered a mournful lullaby! Everyone rejoices at escaping from the tiger's mouth, but doubts about tomorrow's life.

However, what they encounter, apart from ridicule, disdain, cold sarcasm, and hot irony... a string of sharp pricks, who will sympathize? Take pity?

The life of exile, the dust of foreign lands, arouses infinite sadness in the heart.

In the silent midnight, a group of lost lambs in the wind has awakened! They know that survival requires struggle, so they are firmly searching for the path of light to move forward.

### Steelmaking

— Chen Chifei

The furnace of resistance

Is burning

Ferociously

Under the iron hammer

Are forged hundreds of millions of people.

Boom, boom, hammer, hammer, scrap iron

Shoots out in all directions

Shoots down into the stinking grave

Shoots down into the rivers of foreign lands.

Boom, boom, hammer, hammer

The scrap iron is gone

What remains

Is

The more hammered, the stronger

The more hammered, the more united

Steel

—The youth that the motherland needs.

Use it

To cast powerful

Cannons

To help the motherland

Reclaim barren land

Bombard the invading enemy.

### Pen

— Wan Yu

In an era of腥風血雨(bloodshed), it is not allowed for Sakyamuni to advocate those ways that can make human beings become Buddhas, because such corrupt melodies as "put down the butcher knife and become a Buddha immediately" are absolutely not suitable for this era. It is very obvious that today's China is the dividing line of all rises and falls, and also the critical moment of all life and death. In order to win the needs that the whole people need, it is natural to start the massacre of the national struggle. There are two objects of massacre in China at present: one is to destroy the strong enemy of all mankind, and the other is to eliminate the scum of the whole nation; and these two points can also be said: the former is internal, and the latter is external.

However, what are the tools for killing people?

Undoubtedly, what the soldiers hold in their hands are knives and guns, steel and sulfur; but all that the literati hold in their hands is only a pen tip that is only an inch long.

Don't think that the pen is a useless thing, it can only write about the Romance of the Western Chamber, Dream of the Red Chamber, Golden Lotus, write about smiling too much, write about three men and three women-style romances; similarly, it can also kill people. The pen in history has long been used as a tool for killing people, and the killing work of the pen at that time may be called the pen. Isn't it? "Others carry swords, I have a pen like a knife," how loud and happy it is.

Unfortunately, although the pen in history can kill people, the object of killing is not wide and not many; the crimes of the killed are not clear; even wrong is right and wrong is wrong, and there are even wrongful killings. In addition, because the killing is not done properly, it is often the case that it cannot be performed vividly and thoroughly, and to the satisfaction of the people. Are these all the mistakes of the pen? Of course not, just because the person who uses it lacks a little observation, lacks a little trick. Therefore, although the pen can be regarded as a sharp weapon for killing people, the problem still lies in the skill of the person holding the pen; the situation is similar, any knife and gun can kill people, and the final key is to follow the killing method adopted by the executioner.

Now, fresh blood has stained the rivers and mountains, and the massacre has long begun. Whether external or internal, all descendants of the Yellow Emperor should stand firm in their posts and perform this sacred task. Then the authors who stand on the cultural front should not forget the responsibility of using the pen instead of the knife.

Look: those things that put on airs; those things that wag their tails; those things that pretend to be ghosts; and those things that look like human beings but are not... All must use the sharp tip of the pen to dissect their abdomen, reveal the secrets in their hearts, cut off their heads, and pour out the darkness of their heads. Authors must absolutely use the pen, so that all ugly monsters and demons will show their original shape when they see it, and dare not be rampant from now on. Let the pen add some historical merits to the massacre of the national struggle, and at the same time let the pen cultivate a little brilliant embellishment on the journey of Chinese culture!

### Random Memories of Vietnam

— A Chinese Traveler

Tired of Hearing About Defeats

After the outbreak of war, our supreme leader once admonished the people of the country:

"Do not be arrogant when you hear of victory, and do not be discouraged when you hear of defeat?" This simply means teaching people to face the battle calmly.

In a certain provincial capital in Indochina, lived an old man (a Vietnamese) who changed it to:

"Be happy when you hear of victory, and do not speak of defeat," as a joke.

It is said that if anyone went to the old man's house to report Chinese military setbacks, he would immediately be thrown out. He said that although he was not Chinese, he loved China very much! He did not want to hear that the China he loved was being defeated, which is the meaning of "do not speak of defeat."

As for other ordinary Annamese people, although they do not love China as passionately as the old poet, when they hear of the × people's inhumane slaughter of peace-loving Chinese, especially when they see in illustrated magazines buildings destroyed by the × people and innocent civilians lying dismembered all over the ground, they sigh and say: Is this how civilized people behave? Feeling a great sense of: "When will this end? We and you will all perish!"—Regarding this, just look at the article "The Sino-Japanese War and Us" signed by Ge Yuan in a certain French newspaper in Hanoi on November 7th of last year, where he openly declared: "China is fighting Japan for us." From this, one can see what kind of attitude they take towards these lovers of slaughter.

Anonymous Donations

When you take a military vehicle from Saigon to Cholon, after the tram has been running for a few seconds, if you look out of the left window of the vehicle, you can see a particularly eye-catching flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth flying high in front of a Western-style building, sandwiched between several towering coconut trees. That is the Consulate General of our Republic of China in Saigon. Under this flag, the iron gate that is open, every day, many Annamese people with exposed faces and anonymous names, bring paper money from the Banque de l'Indochine and donate it to our consulate—why do they give this precious money to the staff of our consulate? And why do they expose their faces but still remain anonymous? From the former point of view, it is of course that they sympathize with our war of resistance! Especially protesting against the robbery of the × people! From the latter point of view! They really have unspeakable suffering! This is very different from the meaning when we casually write "Anonymous" when donating money.

Martial Arts Drama on the Street

I can't remember the date and place clearly, but this incident happened in a certain commercial port in Annam.

It was when the sun was taking weary steps, waving goodbye to everything on the earth, that many people gathered on a certain street, as if competing to watch some kind of magic trick. It turned out that two people who did not know better were performing a martial arts drama there. Because of the crowd, the street police came over with batons in their hands. The roles of the martial arts drama also stopped performing because of the arrival of the street police. Their clothes were torn, and their faces were covered with bloody wounds. In this way, they were taken to the police station based on some signs!

"Why are you fighting?" the official asked.

"We were debating the Sino-Japanese War," the Chinese prisoner said.

"Debating the Sino-Japanese War, why did it lead to fighting?" the official asked again.

"He said that the final victory belongs to China, I didn't agree, so I had a conflict with him!" the Annamese prisoner said.

"Get out of here, he is Chinese, of course he hopes China will win the war. The final victory belongs to them. You are not Japanese, why don't you agree with what he said?" the official said angrily, and slapped the Annamese prisoner! At the same time, he also sentenced him to three weeks in prison. After receiving praise for his patriotism, the Chinese man finally left the police station with a smile.

A Slight Sigh

One afternoon, my wife and I accompanied a friend from Guangzhou named Tan to the zoo to play. Although we were in a foreign country, our hearts were in our homeland. We also grieved for the soldiers fighting the × people on the front lines, and at the same time hated the × people's indiscriminate bombing of our many undefended cities. Therefore, the subject of our conversation was focused on the Sino-Japanese War. Although we were speaking Cantonese, the coachman (Vietnamese) sitting in front seemed to understand a little, and turned his head to me and said:

"Japan is really too arrogant, but unfortunately, this time it bumped into a nose full of ashes! Let's see how fierce he can be for a few more days?"

I felt very strange after hearing this, so I asked him in Annamese: "Why do you see that the Japanese have bumped into a nose full of ashes?"

"Didn't the Japanese military say so? The China Incident can be resolved in just a few months. Now it has been fought for more than a year, gathered the country's elites, and besieged Hankou for several months, but still can't see any hope (at that time, Hankou had not yet been abandoned). From this point, we can see Japan's fatigue. Secondly, taking Annam as an example, before the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the Japanese people here were so aggressive, it was really invincible! Now, has the French government seen the flaws?"

"What flaws have they seen?" I interrupted him and asked.

"In the past, Japanese rogues often caused trouble here. Whenever an accident happened, the colonial government mostly accommodated them, fearing conflict with them: now it is very different. If they do something that harms order, the colonial government will expel them without hesitation. Looking at it this way, isn't this the loss suffered from abusing force?" After he finished speaking, he sighed for the imminent decline of the nouveau riche, and we couldn't help but sigh slightly for it.
