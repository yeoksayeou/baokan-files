### Higher Education Reform Issues

— Zhuang Zexuan

Seven or eight years ago, I published an opinion on "Higher Education Revolution," believing that future universities should be divided into three parts: (1) "Continuing Original Training," (2) "Cultivating Construction Talents for Reorganizing the Interior," and (3) "Cultivating Specialized Talents for Emigration and Borderland Colonization." Since the War of Resistance, I have felt even more that it is necessary to implement this kind of differentiated system. The reason why I advocate adding the (2) and (3) sections of work in universities can be discussed from both theoretical and factual aspects. In terms of theory, I believe that: (1) Chinese education must have a way out for the Chinese nation in order to have a way out; (2) the Chinese nation's way out, in the positive aspect, currently has two main avenues: first, reorganizing the interior to stabilize people's lives and discover the advantages of (inherent) culture; second, developing the frontier to establish a new life for the old culture; (3) the Chinese nation's way out, in the negative aspect, must also take into account two points at present: first, strive for time and energy, especially economy in expenditures, to support the precarious situation; second, encourage national self-confidence and self-reliance to create a psychological foundation for revival; (4) for the sake of reorganizing the interior, what we need most is the training of rural construction leading talents, while the general public should receive broad public education; (5) for the sake of developing the frontier, government capitalists must cooperate with experts and apply scientific knowledge and skills, working from experimentation to promotion, and when promoting, special training must be given to immigrants; (6) in order to strive for economic efficiency, government and social leaders must advocate a frugal life and prevent all waste, and all education must focus on thrift; (7) in order to establish national self-confidence and self-reliance, we should promote the inherent virtues of the Chinese nation, disseminate great achievements and figures in history, and promote domestic goods at any time and place. These words seem even more pressing today, twenty months into the War of Resistance. From a factual perspective, we know that before the War of Resistance, higher education institutions that wanted to work on reorganizing the interior included Henan Rural Governance Institute, Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute, Hebei County Administration Construction Research Institute, Jiangsu Provincial College of Education, Sichuan Provincial College of Education, and the Rural Administration Practice Institute jointly established by the five universities of North China in Jining, Shandong; higher education institutions that wanted to work on developing the frontier included the branch schools established by the Central Political School in various border areas. After inspecting education in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai, I suggested enriching Gansu College to become a center for studying border culture and experimenting with border education. In fact, emigration overseas is also an important part of this work and is one of the original intentions of the founding of National Jinan University.

After the War of Resistance, due to the expansion of the war zone, many public and private universities moved from the coastal provinces to the interior and remote provinces. Although some were left in foreign concessions, unfortunately, these moves and retentions were mostly decided temporarily and rarely planned in advance, resulting in some provinces having numerous higher education institutions, with no division of labor or cooperation plan at all. As for the places that needed higher education, there were no such institutions and no universities moved there, resulting in the establishment of a provincial temporary university in Zhejiang. The higher education institutions that previously focused on reorganizing the interior were unfortunately all in the war zone, so they were mostly forced to stop working. Only Jiangsu Provincial College of Education has moved to Yu, Guangxi, and the Rural Administration Practice Institute jointly run by the five universities has moved to Dingfan, Guizhou, and renamed Rural Administration College. I believe that it is best to establish one such institution in each province, or to reorganize existing higher education institutions. Of course, the work of reorganizing the interior must be carried out in close cooperation with the local government. The professors needed by such institutions should be mainly experts in various fields of social sciences. After giving students basic training in the first year, the training should focus on the urgent problems in the interior, rather than grouping them according to traditional academic departments. The training should focus more on dealing with people, and "learning from doing, teaching from doing, teachers and students jointly solving problems, exploring issues, and exchanging experiences from various places for reference."

The higher education institutions that previously focused on borderland development were originally few, but since the War of Resistance, the need for such institutions has become more urgent. I believe that at least three or four centers should be selected in the Northwest, Southwest, and coastal areas to concentrate manpower and financial resources to establish three or four higher education institutions to assist the development of borderland and overseas undertakings. In the Northwest and Southwest, the application of natural sciences should be the main focus of the curriculum. After giving students basic training in the first year, they should be grouped for training in departments such as reclamation, water conservancy, transportation, heavy industry, light industry, mining, medicine, and health. In social sciences, emphasis should be placed on exploring the cultures of various ethnic groups other than the Han Chinese. In the coastal areas, the application of social sciences should be the main focus of the curriculum. After giving students basic training in the first year, the training should focus on the development of education, finance, industry, commerce, enterprise management, factories, transportation, and other sectors overseas, and the study of cultures in various overseas regions should be a common compulsory subject. Emigration work is not easy, and small-scale trial plantings should be carried out first, gradually expanding, and the problems encountered should be jointly studied and solved by teachers, students, and immigrants.

Higher education institutions that have moved out of the war zone, or were originally in non-war zones, and have not suffered major losses, should continue their original work, cultivating academic and specialized talents. How to divide labor and cooperate in order to save money and achieve greater results is also worth overall planning. If the entire redistribution is done in this way, or if there are too many existing professors, the government should fund them to go abroad for lectures or services. As far as I know, overseas Chinese are very willing to bear part of the travel expenses and welcome scholars who are familiar with the situation in the motherland to give systematic academic lectures, and at the same time, they may help to study the development methods of overseas undertakings. The central government may wish to imitate the service groups of primary and secondary school teachers and organize university professor service groups to serve overseas. If all these things can be done, it will not only help the current War of Resistance but also benefit the future national revival.

### World Trends in a Week

— Pan Lang

From March 26th to April 1st

The heart-pounding month of March has passed in extreme tension, severity, and crisis. The aggressors and the invaded, who would not want to catch their breath and rest? However, serious problems are still closely pursuing us; first, the unity movement of democratic and peace-loving countries has already made some headway, but it is not strong enough to deal a fatal blow to the aggressors. Second, the aggressor countries, Germany in Eastern and Northeastern Europe, Italy in Spain, and even Japan in Nanchang, have all gained something and are also exhausted and want to rest for a while; however, the Soviet Union's peace policy has achieved great success, and the democratic peace front has become more consolidated and expanded. On the contrary, the contradictions within the aggressor camp have reached the point where they cannot be concealed, and they cannot but continue to take the offensive! Finally, when it comes to our China, the internal and external situations have become increasingly better, and the wars in the Gan River and West River have also turned from danger to safety. However, the Japanese conspiracies are endless, and the activities of the traitors have become even more intensified. Our progress is still far from enough, and the national crisis is still extremely serious. This requires each of us who does not want to be a slave to be vigilant and self-motivated.

Strengthening the Democratic Peace Front

Under the threat of the escalating challenges of the fascist aggressor countries Germany, Italy, and Japan, under the sincere and difficult words of the socialist country the Soviet Union, and under the arduous struggles of the vast number of working people and people of peace and justice in various countries, democratic and peace-loving countries such as Britain, France, and the United States have finally begun to take further measures of unity and cooperation. This week, the situation of consolidating and expanding the democratic peace front has become even clearer. Of particular importance is the progress of the British-Soviet negotiations. British Overseas Trade Secretary Hudson had his first four-hour talk with Soviet Foreign Trade Commissioner Mikoyan on March 24. Hudson said that the talk "was harmonious and of political importance." On the 25th, the British pro-German newspaper, "Daily Mail," reported that "the Soviet Union requested that Britain and the Soviet Union must take joint military action." On the 27th, the Hong Kong "Smedley's Four Newspapers" claimed that in British-Soviet military cooperation, the Soviet side suggested that it could freely use Vladivostok and Kamchatka during wartime, while the British side would take the route through Canada to aid the Soviet Union. On the 27th, Moscow announced that "the British-Soviet trade negotiations have established a foundation and will continue in London. As for international issues, the exchange of views has resulted in the establishment of personal contacts to seek mutual cooperation on international events." The establishment of friendly cooperative relations between Britain and the Soviet Union is not only, as the French political circles believe, "enough to maintain European peace," but also enough to contribute to world peace. This is the foundation for consolidating and expanding the democratic peace line. The smooth progress of the British-Soviet negotiations was followed by the success of the British-Polish negotiations. Poland announced that it would never allow itself to be succumbed to Germany, and stepped up its preparations for war. British Prime Minister Chamberlain also stated in the House of Commons on the 31st that "Britain is determined to assist Poland and cooperate in resisting any aggression!" Following closely is the closer cooperation between Britain and France! The two countries are now actively conducting military alliance negotiations. The British military delegation has arrived in France, and French Air Minister La Chambre will also go to Britain. French Prime Minister Daladier's speech on the 29th resolutely rejected Italy's demands. As for the joint anti-aggression declaration issued by the two countries, it is even less of a problem. Finally, although there is no significant progress in British-American relations, judging from the decision on the British King's visit to the United States and the brewing of British-American economic sanctions against Germany, the situation is still optimistic. On the American side, while burying themselves in war preparations, they have temporarily shelved the discussion of neutrality law, clearly expressing their support for democratic countries. All these facts have expanded. However, we must also know at the same time that the transformation of British and French policies is not persistent and thorough enough, and there is even the intention of using empty threats against the aggressors and using progressive policies to ease the anti-opposition wave in the country. The French president will soon be re-elected, and the British cabinet reshuffle plan has also been put forward by Eden and others. We must now intensify the unification and development of the anti-fascist and anti-aggression movements of the people of Britain and France, promote the collective security system, and further guarantee the victory of the democratic peace front in order to thoroughly sweep away the dark spirits of the war.

Exposing the Cracks in the Aggressor Group

The new success of the Soviet Union's peace policy, the tendency to consolidate and expand the democratic peace front, and the surging anti-fascist and anti-aggression wave among the people of various countries have made the fascist aggressors begin to panic! It has exposed the cracks in the fascist aggressor group! What is attracting attention first is the intensification of the German-Italian contradictions: because the direction of the German aggression has threatened the sphere of influence and the aggression targets of Italy, Hungary and Yugoslavia, causing the uneasiness of the Italian country. And Italy launched Hungary to compete for the Little Russia area of Czechoslovakia, and was counterattacked by the German-commanded Slavic army, which caused even greater anger to the Italian side. Unexpectedly, the exposure of Germany's plan to obtain the Yugoslav market made Italy even more feel the threat of Germany, and had to seek countermeasures. The news of the cracks in the "German-Italian axis" came out. The second is the intensification of the German-Japanese contradictions. The Associated Press Shanghai telegram on the 1st stated: The German-Japanese relations have recently been broken, the reasons are: (1) China recently signed a barter trade agreement with Germany worth 10 million yuan, (2) Japan dare not participate in the military alliance of the anti-communist axis, (3) China recently suddenly imported a huge amount of goods and munitions from Germany. Made the Japanese aggressors talk about disrupting the spirit of the anti-communist agreement.

Originally, the front line of the aggressor countries is a collusion of interests, and "anti-communism" is a kind of cover for this ××× collusion. With the development of aggressive labor, the contradictions between them must also develop accordingly. The final infighting is inevitable. Moreover, the Italian-German collusion is actually only Italy, led by Mussolini, waving the flag for Hitler's conscription, and has only suffered humiliation and has little benefit. Similarly, in the German-Japanese collusion, Japan has no way to obtain any practical help from Germany, and Germany also has the distress of sacrificing its original rights and interests in China. This is the congenital deficiency of the aggressive group. Disintegration is not a strange thing, but is inevitable.

However, if we conclude today that the aggressive group has begun to collapse, then it is not only "not yet the time," but it is very likely that the aggressors will "smile sinisterly"! First of all, let's talk about Italian-German relations. Italy's alliance with Germany is indeed a great loss, but if Mussolini's aggressive policy does not go bankrupt one day, then the Italian-German axis must still exist one day. Because Mussolini wants to protect his stolen goods in Abyssinia and Spain, and "not to be a prisoner of the Mediterranean" but to "establish a great Roman Empire," he must rely on Germany to help him attack Britain and France in order to realize these attempts. In Mussolini's speech on March 26, although he had revealed his anxiety about Germany's attitude, he had to try his best to use "moderate" tones. However, it is better to say that he is eager to ask for Germany's assistance than to say that he is willing to abandon the axis! Goering will visit Mussolini soon. Let's look at the facts in the future! Secondly, the German-Japanese alliance is indeed opposed by the majority of the Japanese population, and the interests of Germany and Japan are also conflicting. However, the Japanese aggressors know the wonderfulness of "distant friendship and close attack," and without the banner of "anti-communism," the war against China will lose its excuse, and the military and civilian morale will not be said, and the ugly state of the camp will be fully exposed, and it will not be avoided from the total collapse! So when we talk about this, we have to pay attention to:

The Japanese are hatching new conspiracies

The longer the Japanese military aggression against China lasts, the more uncertain the future is, and the more the tendency of collapse in the country and even in the army develops. This is what the Japanese authorities clearly know! Therefore, on the one hand, they attempt to eliminate the main force of China's resistance, blockade and cut off China's foreign aid with the highest degree of exertion of combat power, so as to quickly subdue China and quickly end the war. However, this kind of attempt has little hope because of the improvement of China's internal and external situation, so they cannot but carry out their poisonous tricks of "anti-communism," "peace," "mediation," etc. to induce surrender at any time. Although the German ambassador Trautmann's conspiracy and the tragic failure of Wang Jingwei's conspiracy, the Japanese are still trying their best to realize it.

Recently, the British ambassadors to Japan and China met in Shanghai to discuss issues such as protecting the Shanghai concessions and the British political and economic interests in China that have been destroyed by Japan. The Associated Press Chongqing telegram on the 29th stated that the two ambassadors will also discuss the current situation in China and Japan and mediate the problem. The Japanese took the opportunity to spread rumors of their mediation and compromise. Following this, there was news that the Sino-German business relationship had improved and that a 10 million yuan trade agreement had been reached. The Associated Press Shanghai telegram on the 29th reported: "Since the Sino-German relationship has progressed, Germany may act as a mediator to mediate the Sino-Japanese war." The Japanese poisonous trick of inducing surrender is even more rampant. On April 1, it was reported that Wang Jingwei immediately published an article catering to the Japanese intentions, advocating what "international mediation and direct negotiations should be carried out simultaneously, so that I can assist from the sidelines in the status of an opposition party." The Japanese black screen of desperately seeking peace but still trying to induce surrender has been partially revealed!

As yesterday's editorial in this newspaper has clearly stated, the purpose of this total performance of the Japanese traitors is "to weaken the prestige of our government among the people and in the international community, to provoke and alienate our domestic unity and international relations, and to undermine the cooperation of democratic and peace-loving countries"! The Japanese spreading rumors, secretly using poisonous tricks, and the traitors deliberately catering to and fueling the flames, are only destroying China's anti-Japanese national united front. They are only stopping China's national resistance and construction undertakings, and the ultimate goal is to realize the inducement to surrender, realize the conquest of China, and then dominate the Pacific.

However, this conspiracy and poisonous trick of the Japanese traitors, as well as any attempt in the international community to rehearse a new Munich farce, will be finally shattered under the increasingly strong united front of the anti-Japanese and nation-building of all parties, all classes, and all ethnic minorities in China! They will be finally shattered under the great power of China's resistance, which has the only highest leader, the leadership of the revolutionary party, the dynamic power on the vast territory, and the support of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, and the justice of the working masses all over the world! The Associated Press Shanghai telegram on the 31st was right: "China's national power, whether political, diplomatic, financial, or economic, is showing rapid progress. China will never reconcile halfway!" Today, the Chinese people must closely monitor the Japanese conspiracy and prepare to give it a thorough blow. The main thing is to promote greater progress in politics: the chain of progress of resistance, democracy, and mobilization.

The Situation of the Anti-Japanese War in a Week

Perhaps some people will say that the reason why the Japanese traitors have recently launched another round of conspiracies and poisonous tricks of "anti-communism," "peace," "compromise," "mediation," etc. to induce surrender is due to China's recent military setbacks. In fact, as a result of the fighting this week, Nanchang, the only large city left in southeastern China, has also fallen, and there have been reports of the fall of Jiangmen in southern Guangdong twice. China has suffered considerable losses. But do we not see Japan's losses? Do we not look at the entire war situation? Do we arbitrarily say "China has failed" and "Japan has won again"? No, this is a big mistake and a great sin!

The Japanese attack on Nanchang is based on the entire plan. We have already emphasized it several weeks ago. However, we must also understand: (1) Judging from the purpose of the Japanese attack on Nanchang, it is still passive, attempting to boost its increasingly exhausted morale on the one hand, and attempting to cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and threaten the Yuehan Railway to strengthen its rule in the occupied areas of China and facilitate attacks on the guerrillas on the other hand; (2) Judging from the strategy of the Japanese attack on Nanchang, it is still in a passive situation due to the passivity of its purpose. It cannot and dare not break through our main force; on the other hand, it is forced to only fight for cities and transportation lines, leaving space everywhere on the wings and the flanks, and the connection and supply are completely inconsistent. Therefore, the Japanese cross the Xiu River, and our Lushan area guerrillas have cut off its rear. The Japanese cross the Gan River, and Anyi, Fengxin, and other places have been recovered one after another; (3) Judging from the advantages and disadvantages of the fall of Nanchang, Nanchang is the protruding point of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and it is in a disadvantageous strategic situation. Now that we have withdrawn from Nanchang, we will wait for the opportunity to counterattack the Japanese. Until now, the Japanese still dare not go south. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is still connected in a straight line south of Nanchang, and has not actually been cut off. On the contrary, the Japanese occupied Nanchang and suffered heavy losses due to the elite troops left in the city to fight street battles, and the 4th Division of the Japanese army that attacked Nanchang suffered 15,000 casualties after a week of fierce fighting. (The Associated Press Shanghai telegram on the 30th stated that the Japanese have suffered 30,000 casualties in northern Jiangxi in the past week.) In the Wuning line of war, the Japanese also suffered 4,000 casualties! (4) In this battle, we have proved the success of the mobile strategy, realized the close cooperation of the air and land forces, and completed the plan to annihilate a large number of the Japanese main force. Now, our anti-offensive has been launched in the Jiangxi-Hubei-Hunan border, northern Jiangxi, Lushan, and southern Anhui, and the main force of the Japanese army in central China will suffer greater punishment without a doubt.

Secondly, the war in South China is also tense. The Japanese army captured Rongqi and Guizhou in succession, and broke into Jiangmen and Zhongshan Shiqi twice; it was shaken. The momentum of the Japanese army seemed to be very daunting. However, from a strategic point of view, the Japanese army's operation this time is also passive, attempting to consolidate its occupation in Guangzhou in order to actively develop its "mopping up" guerrilla warfare and consolidate its rear when it attacks the southwest in the future. Its purpose is similar to that of attacking and capturing Nanchang. Now that our large army has reinforced, the situation has calmed down. However, the Japanese attach more importance to the strategy of attacking the southwest than to the central China. In the future, they will also attempt to use the battle of attacking Jiangmen, etc., to attract and attack our main force, and then take the route through Beihai, violently invade the southern route, and spy on Nanning. At the same time, they will use the Japanese forces in the northwest and other two lines to divide and attack Wuzhou and Guilin to disperse our military strength. The Japanese have long recognized the southwest as our main base for resistance and the main international passage. In addition, the international background is easier to deal with than the northwest, the Japanese naval, land, and air force connection is also easier, the marching distance is shorter, and the Han people and pro-Japanese elements are intensifying their activities. This is what we must pay close attention to and guard against.

Finally, the war situation in East China and North China has not changed significantly recently. Due to the stimulation of the Japanese attack on Nanchang, large-scale guerrilla warfare in various places in East China has been actively prepared. In North China, General Zhu De has taken up the concurrent post of Deputy Commander of a certain war zone on the 27th, and on the 29th, he will do his best to consolidate the anti-Japanese base behind the enemy and fight the Japanese imperialism to the end to establish a new China of the Three People's Principles. At the same time, the telegram of the great victory in southern Jin was also found in the Hong Kong newspapers yesterday. The Japanese side has rumored that our army will launch a large-scale counter-offensive against North China. Although this is from the Japanese newspapers, developing guerrilla warfare behind the enemy is indeed our most important and urgent task at present to "stop the Japanese offensive and strive for the final victory." We are looking forward to even greater victories.

(The "End of the War" in Spain has been temporarily removed due to space limitations.)

### Dr. Baker Talks About His Impressions of Inspecting North China

[Shanghai Correspondence] This city's foreign news, Dr. Baker, General Secretary of the China Foreign Relief Association Disaster Relief Association, returned to Shanghai on the 20th after a three-week inspection of North China, and told reporters that although the flood situation in North China this year is not as serious as in previous years, most of the people in the area still need to be relieved. Although the winter harvest is abundant, the income of farmers has decreased, because only the Japanese army buys cotton, and what the Japanese army pays is only one-third of the cotton price. At present, the Japanese army and bandits in North China are all over the place, so it is a difficult task to relieve the farmers. It is no longer safe for those who carry money into the countryside, and valuable items will almost certainly be looted by bandits. The stagnation of commerce in the small counties also makes this task difficult. Since it is not possible to carry money to various counties, or because of the lack of convenient banks in these areas, it is impossible to remit money. Dr. Baker also said that when he was in North China, the Japanese implemented new currency methods, the purpose of which was to harm the value of Chinese legal tender. However, this move has been a complete failure since its implementation. Not only has it failed to stop the circulation of legal tender, but it has also helped to increase the premium of legal tender, which has already been upgraded. The method advocated by the Japanese side aims to prohibit the public from circulating legal tender. In name, anyone who is found carrying a paper of one jiao of legal tender will be sentenced to 10,000 yuan. However, if the "Joint Banknote" is found on the person by the guerrillas, he will be sentenced to death. The business of foreign merchants is indeed at a standstill. Foreigners now understand that all businesses will eventually be controlled by the Japanese. Now foreign merchants are waiting for development. Regarding the Japanese monopoly on wool, Dr. Baker believes that this move will inevitably fail. Shops that weave carpets are now unable to buy wool in the market. The method of transportation has improved slightly recently, but the train only runs during the day and still stops at night. The guerrillas still attack the railway station. Along this line, strong fortresses can be seen. The important locations along the transportation line are now guarded by the Japanese army and members of the Red Spear Society. Dr. Baker also criticized the public morale, saying that few people with smiling faces are seen, and no one is seen riding a horse on the street, which may indicate that they have not yet forgotten their worries. Many houses are being built in Peiping, most of which are owned by the Japanese. Rents have increased sharply, but salaries have also increased. Military trucks are often seen in rows on the streets of Peiping, speeding past, causing traffic congestion. Several Japanese geishas now live in Peiping, and Japanese merchants are also increasing sharply.

### A Year in Review and Future Prospects for Yulin Culture

(Reading yesterday's news)

The Journalists Association has publicly recommended Mr. Li Sheng Lun (special correspondent for the "Sweeping Away" newspaper) as the director of the preparatory office, which includes a wartime operations department. This department is further divided into communication, service, and editing groups.

The Northwest War Zone Cultural Work Troupe is entirely a war zone service organization, structured as follows:

General Affairs Group.

Northwest War Zone Cultural Work Troupe Publication Group – War Reports, Series, Comics.

War Work Group – Frontline Theater, Choral Singing.

The work of this troupe is underway, and it will bear the arduous cultural task of defending the Great Northwest in battle.

Finally, we must mention the many exiled youths who love their country and fight for it with bloodshed. Coming from all over, they arrived in northern Shaanxi and, in cooperation with local youth, formed anti-Japanese propaganda teams. Under the leadership of the 21st Army Corps, they began their sacred and great work in March 1938.

This anti-Japanese propaganda team was led by Mr. Ba Zhiguo, a student from Northeastern University. They wrote many excellent plays as propaganda material for rural areas. Their popular pamphlets and heroic songs awakened millions of people. In the midst of the mass movement, they trained over a hundred young cadres who were dispersed to schools and units, playing a promotional role. Fresh slogans and comics were posted throughout the streets, and mournful, resolute songs filled the ancient Yulin city. Their figures were present in many mass meetings and routine gatherings, giving impassioned speeches. It is worth noting that they established a short-term Japanese language training class, where each team member learned thirty to forty everyday Japanese phrases for use on the front lines. Their efforts to educate the masses and soldiers also yielded excellent results.

Yulin was once invaded by the Japanese. To serve the wounded officers and soldiers at the time, the anti-Japanese propaganda team established a wounded soldier慰问隊 in Yulin, soliciting books and newspapers from various Yulin agencies for distribution to the wounded soldiers for reading. They regularly sent staff to write letters home, read books and newspapers, sing songs, tell stories, and wash clothes... They comforted the wounded soldiers and encouraged their courage to return to the front lines.

Due to the influence and encouragement of the anti-Japanese propaganda team, the schools automatically established a summer rural service corps. Energetic and healthy high school students enthusiastically participated, enriching the organization. They quickly set off for the countryside and the front lines, living alongside soldiers and farmers. They fulfilled their responsibilities for propaganda and organization, greatly promoting military-civilian cooperation.

Following the rural service corps came the establishment of a frontline war zone service corps and the Great Era Theater Troupe, jointly organized by three graduating schools. Subsequently, the middle school students' "Aspiring Youth Society" and the county-led "Youth Anti-Japanese Pioneer Corps" were also formed. All these groups surrounded tens of thousands of people and fulfilled the missions given to them by the era, which is truly commendable.

Here, we want to introduce the Mongolian-Tibetan Art Propaganda Team. It was led by young artists from China, such as Zhang, Tao, Jinye, and Feng. This was a propaganda organization under the command of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Guidance Office, targeting Mongolia. These young people possessed artistic and writing talents. They performed countless plays in this area and published a Mongolian propaganda painting collection and a Mongolian song collection. Undoubtedly, these were all expressions of promoting Mongolian work further.

In the flames of war during the year of resistance, the cultural workers of Yulin made people feel excited and invigorated in the ancient city on the frontier. They did their due diligence for the country and the nation. However, it is undeniable that the depth and breadth of their work were still insufficient. We believe:

(1) The mass movement today should be actively launched and advanced in coordination with the situation of the War of Resistance and should serve the War of Resistance at all times in accordance with the times.

(2) The cultural movement mainly educates the masses and raises the national consciousness of the people through the masses, so that everyone can go to the forefront of the War of Resistance. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent for the cultural movement to penetrate into the countryside.

(3) Cultural workers should use their sharp weapons to forcefully stab the military-fascist Japanese bandits and exert their due effect.

The sacred War of Resistance of the Chinese nation has entered a more difficult second stage. Defending the Great Northwest has become a difficult task for every one of the 450 million compatriots. Cultural workers should overcome their own weaknesses and the objective situation no longer allows their weaknesses to exist.

Therefore, regarding the future prospects of Yulin's cultural workers, I would like to leave the following message:

Cultural workers need and urgently demand that they work hard in the face of difficulties, and bear the responsibilities they should and will bear in the raging tide of war on the frontier ancient city. In other words, the future is bright!

### Fierce Battles Continue in Southwest Nanchang; Attempt to Break Through at Matang in Northern Hunan Fails; Our Forces Capture Ding County and Invade Qiang in Southern Hebei

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 1st] Approximately two regiments of Japanese troops invading south of Nanchang have engaged in fierce battles with our forces in the area of Shaputan, Xincun, Banxuhu, Yangjiahuang, and Xishi on both banks of the Fushui River's tributaries in recent days. They are currently attempting to advance towards Sanjiangkou, but are being fiercely repulsed by our forces. In the vicinity of Liangjiadu and Wenchuan Ferry north of the Gan River, there are attempts to infiltrate Jinxian. Our forces are blocking them. Japanese forces are currently engaged in battle with our forces in the area south of Wuning, including Yapo Ridge, Jigong Cliff, and the northwest of Yanyang Mountain. The fighting between Fengxin and Gaoan remains intense.

[Central News Agency, Miluo, 1st] On the morning of the 31st, Japanese troops attempting to break through from Matang Station and Xinkaitang towards our army corps suffered heavy casualties in fierce fighting until night. The remaining Japanese troops retreated back to their strongholds, holding out for reinforcements. According to reports, the number of Japanese wounded transported from the front lines to Yuezhou in recent days has reached over five hundred, with the number of those killed in battle likely being even greater.

Solid Defense in Eastern Zhejiang; Japanese Warships Attempt to Spy on Dinghai

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 1st] Japanese warships have attempted to spy on the Dinghai Island situation in Eastern Zhejiang. Our forces are strong and the Japanese will definitely not succeed.

[Special Report from Shanghai] According to news from Jinhua, after the heightened tension on the coast of Eastern Zhejiang, the Military Affairs Commission, in addition to dispatching the elite 5th Division and Xiang Army's Tao Guang unit to reinforce the defense, also sent Zhou Enlai, Deputy Minister of the Political Department, to Eastern Zhejiang to inspect and discuss matters with Zhejiang Chairman Huang Weixiong and Commander-in-Chief of the XX Group Army Liu Jianxu. It is rumored that Zhou will be traveling to southern Anhui. The current military strength in Zhejiang Province has reached one million, distributed as follows: (1) The coastal area is garrisoned by the troops of the Wenzhou-Taizhou and Ningbo defense command headquarters, and the security team of Xuan Wu, the Director of the Zhejiang Security Office; (2) Defensive works have been built on the south bank of the Qiantang River, garrisoned by the Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaoxiong's unit; (3) Areas along the Fuchun River and other places are garrisoned by the Xiang Army's Liu Jianxu unit; (4) Another two divisions of mobile troops have been dispatched, crossing the Qiantang River along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, heading directly to Nanjing to prevent reinforcements to Nanchang. They have now retreated back to Hangzhou.

Battle of Shulu in Southern Hebei; Japanese General Umezu Killed in Action

[Reuters, Chongqing, 1st] According to news received here from Zhengzhou, Lieutenant General Umezu Yoshijiro, famous for signing the "He-Umezu Agreement" (former Vice Minister of the Army, Commander of the Japanese Garrison Army in China, a prominent figure in the Young Officers' Faction), the current Commander-in-Chief of the 1st Army Group of the Japanese Army in North China, was killed by Chinese forces in a fierce battle near Shulu, southeast of Zhengding in central Hebei Province, on March 22nd or 23rd. It is reported that Umezu and his staff, on March 22nd, led a large artillery unit, tank unit, and infantry unit in 70 vehicles towards Shulu and Jixian. They engaged in battle with Chinese forces at Guijiazhuang. After 24 hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army suffered 850 casualties. Umezu, along with the Japanese defense commander of Shulu and the artillery commander, were among those killed.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 1st] The war situation in Henan Province is calm, while Japanese troops in Shanxi are busy with troop movements, attempting to attack Quyu. Our forces have taken strict precautions. Fierce battles between our forces and Japanese troops continue between Shenchi and Pianguan. Pianguan remains in our hands. In southern Hebei, our forces have captured Ding County and invaded Zaoqiang. Japanese troops in Qingzhou and Anqiu in Shandong Province are invading south along the Ling River, attempting to spy on Yishui. Our forces are intercepting them.

[Central News Agency, Dongyang, 1st] The Japanese troops at Jigong Mountain retreated completely to Liulin yesterday. The reason is that after our pressure, Zhongshanpu was recaptured by us. Today, the Japanese reinforced that location and are fighting with us for it.

### Battle for Jiangmen; Thousands of Japanese Troops Killed in Four Days of Bloody Fighting; Rumor of Temporary Retreat Yesterday Awaiting Opportunity for Counterattack

(Quick Report from Shiqi) The battle for Jiangmen, which began on the 29th, was fiercely resisted by our brave forces. As of the morning of yesterday, the 1st, the Japanese temporarily retreated after suffering over a thousand casualties. The details are as follows:

Japanese Troops Continue to Attack

On the 29th and 30th, after suffering heavy blows from our forces at Tangxia and Beilu, the Japanese troops realized their weakness and transferred Japanese troops from Daliang, Jiujiang, Ronggui, and other places to provide reinforcements. On the morning of the 31st, over 20 Japanese boats carrying two to three hundred soldiers landed at Zhutou Mountain and advanced towards Beijie. At the same time, over a thousand Japanese troops advanced from the Jiang-Fo Road towards Shaping, attempting to attack Jiangmen from multiple directions. Over 20 Japanese aircraft repeatedly bombed various locations, including Jiangmen, Huicheng, and Beijie, from morning to dusk on the 31st to support the Japanese troops' advance. To date, the number of Japanese troops in Xinhui has increased to two to three thousand.

Hitting Our Landmines

On the 31st, the Japanese troops who landed at Zhutou Mountain advanced to the Wanhualou near the East Fort when they triggered our pre-buried landmines, causing an immediate explosion. Japanese soldiers fell to the ground in droves, with over a hundred Japanese soldiers killed or wounded. The Japanese troops continued to rush fiercely towards Jiangmen. At the same time, Japanese warships on the Tianhe Sea fired intensively at Beijie, with shells raining down. Our army fought bravely, but due to the intense artillery fire, all coastal defenses were destroyed by 10:00 AM, forcing them to retreat. Beijie was again occupied by the Japanese.

Fighting for Jiangmen

After Beijie fell again, a Japanese unit rushed towards Jiangmen along the Jiangbei Highway, heading directly for the city. Our forces engaged the Japanese in street fighting, charging and killing each other, and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Our forces retreated and advanced repeatedly, annihilating over half of the attacking Japanese troops. By 6:00 PM, the Japanese troops again rushed in from the Jiaotou area, and our forces began to shift their positions, but continued to fight the Japanese on Dixi Road and Changan Road. It is estimated that our forces engaged in mixed warfare in Jiangmen City for several hours, killing over two hundred Japanese soldiers. Our army also suffered some casualties. According to the latest intelligence, our army withdrew from Jiangmen because the outer defense positions had fallen into the hands of the Japanese and had obtained a price from the Japanese, but they are still holding on in the mountains, maintaining a stalemate with the Japanese. Our reinforcements have arrived and are annihilating the Japanese army.

### Japanese Landing in Fangcheng Unsuccessful

[Central News Agency, Yingde, 31st] At noon on the 29th, three Japanese warships suddenly used machine guns and cannons to cover motorboats at Qisha in southern Fangcheng, attempting to land near Qisha. After our defending army fought bravely, sinking several Japanese boats in over an hour of fierce fighting, the Japanese fled back to the warships.

### Spring Festival Held in Chongqing

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 1st] Over 300 soldiers here held a spring festival ceremony at the Guandi Temple in this city at 3:00 AM today. The ceremony was presided over by Garrison Commander Liu Zhi, in accordance with ancient rites, with Chinese and Western music played together. All participants bowed in salute until dawn. It is also reported that other major cities are also holding this spring festival.

### Japanese Forces Forcibly Occupy Storm Island, Causing Serious Repercussions in France; U.S. Authorities Also Take It Very Seriously

Reporter Reveals That Japanese Forces Notified France

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Chongqing, 1st] After it was reported that the Japanese had occupied the Four Sands Islands, our reporter interviewed people in diplomatic circles. According to them, what the Japanese occupied was actually Storm Island (also known as Spratly Island) in the Tuan Sha Islands, not the Xisha Islands. It is located between French Indochina and the Philippine Tubbataha Reef. It originally belonged to our country but was occupied by France. This rash, forcible occupation will inevitably cause repercussions in France and the United States.

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] The Japanese forcible occupation of Storm Island has caused, to say the least, great shock here. The French side believes that this island is actually owned by France and is actually occupied by France. The French government had previously notified all countries about this matter. Previously, the Japanese had raised a dispute with France regarding its ownership here. In the course of discussions, Japan suddenly put forward a note of automatic occupation, its attitude extremely arrogant. However, France and Japan will not constitute a war because of the ratio, and its future destiny will still be determined in the peace treaty.

[Washington, 31st] U.S. Secretary of State Hull said that he attaches great importance to the Japanese automatic occupation of Storm Island near Annam, but he has not yet received formal notification from the Japanese government.

### Japanese Aircraft Spy on Jiangxi

[Central News Agency, Ji'an, 31st] At around 1:00 PM today, a Japanese aircraft flew over Xinjin and came near Ji'an. It was fired upon by our forces and quickly fled. At around 3:00 PM, another ten Japanese aircraft, six of which flew over Zhangshu and scattered, and four of which flew south, scattered to the suburbs of Xinjin and dropped several bombs before fleeing. Three bombs were dropped in Matou Village in the territory of Jiyong County before fleeing. We suffered no losses. After the Japanese aircraft wreaked havoc, two aircraft again invaded the suburbs of Ji'an, scouted for a while, and fled.

### Three Soldiers of the Shanghai Four Banks Leave Camp

[Reuters, Shanghai, 1st] Three soldiers of the Shanghai Public Concession's Four Banks isolated army left camp at 7:00 AM yesterday and went elsewhere. The Shanghai police authorities are currently investigating this matter.

### National Government Orders

(Central News Agency, Chongqing, 1st) National Government Order of the 1st:

(1) Hu Shuhua, President of Chongqing University in Sichuan Province, is appointed to another post. Hu Shuhua should be relieved of his current position.

(2) Zheng Feng is appointed as the Secretary-General of the Provisional Provincial Assembly of Guangdong Province.

### Executive Yuan Promotes Industrial Cooperatives; Cooperative Associations Establish Offices in Various Locations; Many Large Cooperatives Have Been Organized in Yunnan

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 31st] The Executive Yuan initiated the organization of the "Chinese Industrial Cooperative Association" in July of last year and allocated 5 million yuan as a fund. Its main task is to relieve and organize workers to increase production. Currently, the association has established offices in Ganzhou, Shaoyang, Baoji, and Kunming. After the Yunnan office was established in February, it has formed large rattan industry and cast iron industry cooperatives, and will set up offices in outer counties to promote this cooperative business widely.

### Yunnan Pawnshops; Kunming Farmers Bank Orders Loans to Develop

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Kunming, 1st] The Kunming Farmers Bank, following the order of the Ministry, plans to lend one million to develop the pawnshop industry. The Provincial Yunnan Bank has agreed to cooperate.

### Grain Exports; New Measures Enacted in Guangxi Province; To Prevent Unauthorized Transportation

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 31st] The Guangxi Provincial Government has formulated two measures to prevent the transportation of large quantities of rice: For amounts of 3,000 jin or more, a certificate from the local government of the rice-purchasing province is required for export. For amounts between 1,000 jin and 3,000 jin, the local county government should investigate and issue a release permit before transportation is allowed.

### Although the Coastline is Blockaded, Foreign Trade is Not Affected; Customs Publishes Annual Report with Detailed Commentary; Imports Have Increased Year by Year for the Past Three Years

[Our Hong Kong News] Since our country launched the sacred War of Resistance, the coastline has been blockaded. Although foreign trade is not as convenient as before, it has not had any significant impact. According to the Customs' annual report, the amount of foreign trade in 1938 exceeded that of 1936 before the war by 64.9 million yuan, compared to 164.7 million yuan in 1937, the amount of foreign trade was 179.1 million yuan. The import trade in the past three years has all been progressive, with the following figures: (1936) 23.5 million yuan, (1937) 11.5 million yuan, (1938) 12.3 million yuan. The customs revenue for 1938 was 254,565,469 yuan in national currency, compared to 342,899,739 yuan in the previous year, a reduction of 88,334,270 yuan, or 26 percent. The customs duties in 1937 were 342,899,739 yuan, of which 262,261,262 yuan were the revenue during the period from January to July, which was the pre-war income. In the five months after the outbreak of the war, customs revenue was 254,565,269 yuan. Imports in 1938 decreased from 95.3 million yuan in 1937 to 88.6 million yuan.

### Two Different Scenes

— Fan Shiqin

Around the Battles in Central Hubei

After arriving in Jingmen, it rained heavily for four consecutive days. Although the weather had cleared up on the 20th, the roads were still full of mud, so we had to endure another day. At 1:00 PM that afternoon, an air raid alert sounded. As we climbed up the mountainside on the edge of the city, we heard the "嗡嗡嗡" sound. In less than two minutes, we saw nine shining Japanese aircraft flying across the city sky. Everyone thought the Japanese aircraft had gone elsewhere, and emotions returned to normal. Unexpectedly, the Japanese aircraft suddenly turned around, and the "嗡嗡嗡" sound became even louder.

"噓噓" A strange cry resounded in the sky. This strange cry was like a group of evil spirits shouting. Before we could even hear the loud sound, we saw a plume of black smoke rising from south to north in the city, instantly turning the entire city into a sea of smoke. At this time, the beautiful scenery of Jingmen was covered by a murderous aura.

The "嗡嗡" sound grew closer, and again a "噓噓噓" strange cry sounded above our heads and in our ears for a long time, followed by the "碰碰碰" sound. Another plume of black smoke rose in the city, with two places emitting red flames. It was as if the city's blood was spurting out. After the Japanese aircraft passed, there was a commotion on the mountain and below. The people hiding on the mountain, although avoiding the danger, were all concerned about the fate of their houses and hurriedly ran down the mountain.

Five minutes later, the "嗡嗡嗡" sound echoed in the sky again. Immediately, nine more Japanese aircraft flew from the south. Upon reaching the city sky, they divided into three groups, and the "噓噓噓" "碰碰碰" bombs fell like rain. Black, string-like bombs flew down from the sky. Some bloomed in mid-air, with a cluster of flames flying in all directions, while others exploded in the city, with clusters of fire rising one after another. A school founded by Americans, a church with the American flag hanging above it, and the American emblem painted brightly on the tiles could not escape the engulfment of the Japanese bombs.

It was like waking from a nightmare.

An adjutant of the XX Army said that the army was holding a military-civilian entertainment party that night and invited reporters to attend. At the entertainment party, upon hearing the news that Commander-in-Chief XX knew that Jingmen had been bombed, he distributed 1,000 yuan in relief funds to the disaster victims. This made people very excited. Here, we must admire the spirit of the military and civilians of Jingmen. Although they encountered such a severe bombing during the day, the gongs and drums at their entertainment party that night were louder than the Japanese bombs, and the crowds of military and civilians were just like those huddled in an air raid shelter, unable to breathe.

Eight pairs of soldiers, dressed as eight pairs of strangely dressed men and women, danced and sang, with the lamplight and candlelight accompanying their dance steps and the sound of gongs and drums blending with their songs. The reporter himself almost suspected that he was in a grand night dance party on the screen.

The most amusing thing was a boat lantern. There was a boat girl on the surface and a boatman outside. The boatman was using a paddle, and the boat girl inside,忽緩忽急忽進忽退, matched very naturally.

Scene after scene passed, everyone cheering, everyone laughing loudly, covering up the wounds of the day.

Going to the front lines of central Hubei, we encountered the most tense time. On the 28th, Commander-in-Chief XX led several important generals to personally command the battle on the front lines. The reporter happened to meet them on the way, and during a brief conversation, sincerely wished him another "Taierzhuang".

This time, the Japanese offensive in central Hubei was divided into three routes. It goes without saying that the main force was on the highway line (Beijing-Zhongxiang-Hanyi Road), because if the Japanese main force left the highway line, it would no longer be effective and might be eliminated by us; one route was from Jingshan north to attack Sanyangdian; and one route was from Tianmen south to attack Yuekou. The Japanese objective in attacking Sanyangdian was to attract our main force, and then the Japanese would put on a main offensive facade on the Jing-Zhong Road. Although Sanyangdian and Jing-Zhong Road are only 80 or so miles apart, they are all high mountains and steep ridges. If our main force was attracted to that side, it would be impossible to rush back in one day. Knowing the Japanese plan, we never fell for their trick. The Japanese in Yuekou occupied Yuekou on the 27th in order to cover their frontal attack.

During this operation, the XXXX four commanders of the XXX Group Army were all taking the lead, personally visiting the front lines and directing the battle at the risk of their lives. The Japanese used a large amount of poison gas every day during the dozen or so days of fighting in central Hubei. Although our soldiers suffered heavy casualties, the Japanese losses far exceeded ours.

Here, it should be reminded to everyone that although the fighting in central Hubei this time was very fierce, it was not a strategic attack but a tactical advance. If the Japanese had a major strategic intention, they would have to feign an attack on the XX side. At the same time, they were creating a feint on the XX side. The Japanese at the front lines were only a division and a half, and they were all the original defending troops there. In terms of military strength, the Japanese did not have major intentions. The so-called tactical advance was only an attempt to seize nine front-line strongholds.

The tactical battle launched by the Japanese in central Hubei this time was not without reason. First, because our guerrillas were too active in central Hubei, even infiltrating near Wuhan, and often destroying the puppet organizations played by the Japanese, the Japanese妄想拓拓了前綫地位 in order to cover up the ugly drama of their behind-the-scenes direction. Second, because they knew that our troops were becoming stronger day by day, they feared being severely attacked, so they made an offensive to implement the so-called "policy of ensuring the occupied positions on the front lines." Third, because the Japanese wanted to facilitate their joint operations with the ocean in the future, they first seized the riverine outposts along the river, so that they could launch a large-scale campaign after the spring warms up and the water rises.

The Japanese occupied on the 5th of this month, but this has little impact on us, because Zhongxiang is in the east of the river and there is no defensible terrain to defend, and our regular army guerrillas are still fighting the Japanese in the east of the river. The Japanese now have a vertical front line of more than 200 miles in central Hubei, and our troops are on its flanks, and can flank them at any time. The Japanese will definitely have a disastrous defeat if they want to expand forward, and on the XX side, we have a large army watching them, and the Japanese must feel that there are困雞 both in advancing and retreating.

### Changsha's Revival from Scorched Earth

— Special Air Dispatch from Changsha Zhang Changren

On the highway from Hengyang to Changsha, there are very few military vehicles in operation. At the ferry near Xiangtan, before the great fire of Changsha, there were more than six hundred vehicles waiting to cross south; now, only the one we are in drives onto the north bank. Willows on the roadside, peach blossoms in front of the village, smile at the farmers plowing in spring; the people of eastern Hunan and all over the country are intensifying production to support the war and answer the invaders.

Although the great battle of repairing the Henan and Gan Rivers has begun, the Xiang-E front is still calm.

March in Changsha has revived from the scorched earth. Like the European cities after the Second World War described by Wells in "The Shape of Things to Come," the people after the disaster are rebuilding everything in the ruins. However, it is not so lonely or so desolate, because the great Chinese nation is the most resilient to disasters and the most courageous in creation!

I had witnessed the burning of Changsha, and in just four months, I have seen its new face again. I admire the courage of the people of southern Hunan, who are intensifying the construction of Changsha in the rear, only a hundred kilometers away from the front line.

Changsha, which had more than 60,000 houses and hundreds of thousands of people, was left with only over 10,000 houses and over 30,000 people scattered in the east, south, and north after the fire. Now, new houses are constantly being built in the rubble, and the population has nearly tenfold increased since then, and people returning home are still continuously on the way. Houses made of thatch and wood are only a small part of them, and city houses that pay attention to the façade are gradually increasing. Around Nan Zheng Road, the stores that a metropolis should have are all complete – except for banks and pawnshops.

Gold shops are surprisingly as numerous as tobacco shops. In terms of appearance, they are not as "splendid" as tobacco shops, but in reality, I think they are the hegemon of Changsha's financial world, replacing banks and pawnshops. Many people exchange gold jewelry for cash at these shops, and many houses and shops are built with this exchanged cash one by one. Society is built on an economic foundation. The Changsha office of the Central Bank is about to be established in early April. In the future, Changsha will undoubtedly become stronger and more stable due to financial activities.

The original larger hotels were destroyed, replaced by more than four hundred "grand inns." The largest "Sanhe" has thirty or forty rooms, and the average is from five or six to fourteen or fifteen rooms. The owners of these "grand inns" are mostly fortunate small citizens with a little property. Many shop clerks now have to happily perform the task of "waiters." Almost every household is a store, or at least sets up a stall in front of the door to make a living, and they all look "decent." Even on good weather days, citizens do not think of air raids. The targets of the "flying bandits" under the command of the Japanese army are concentrated peaceful civilians. The more than 200,000 evacuated citizens of Changsha are difficult to satisfy their desire to kill.

The old big stores sell their inventory under the name of temporary stores. The meaning of "temporary" refers to the period before the new stores are completed. New stores often adopt optimistic names for the future as their store names, which gives a glimpse into the general public's feelings about the future of the war of resistance, but there are also inevitably "wavering elements." A restaurant is named "Speculation Hall." I think its owner must be prepared to leave Changsha at any time. Prices are higher than in Hengyang, but much lower than in Guilin, where prices are unreasonably raised. Most of the daily necessities come from Wenzhou, and very few are products of domestic manufacturers. Many brands are unfamiliar, and many trademarks hint at the red of the "sun."

Electricity and telephone services will be restored soon. Agencies and residences that need to use telephones are connected to military telephones. There are three daily newspapers: National Daily (broadsheet), Battlefront Daily (four-page), and People's Daily (small size), and one New Citizen Evening News (eight-page). Recently, various newspapers held charity sales to comfort the soldiers at the front, with some readers purchasing a copy for thirty yuan.

Changsha's night market, although not as good as before, is as bustling as the daytime. Because electricity is still being prepared, a few stores jointly maintain a gasoline street lamp on the bustling streets, one lamp every ten or twenty houses, making the roads brighter than in the past. In remote streets and alleys, residents jointly set up a glass kerosene street lamp every five households. Although it is a bit darker, it is much more convenient for pedestrians. Some poor people often steal oil at night, but they don't steal the lamp, so on some lamps I found humorous ink or white powder words such as "So you're here again!" "If you come to steal lamp oil, you might as well take your wife." The owners of these street lamps mostly laugh it off with the oil thief, because the oil left after a kerosene lamp is lit until late at night is also limited.

Prostitutes are parasites of the military, political, and business communities, especially in these years of war. Women who are born without a place to settle are forced to take this path. The provincial government designated several alleys such as Dadong Mao Lane for registered prostitutes to live in, and green triangle lights are hung in front of the doors at night. However, only 101 are registered, because they are afraid that being too "ostentatious" will affect their business. These alleys used to be the gathering place of Changsha's prominent families, but now I don't know who is in charge. They have been converted into restaurants and hotels. On the passenger list of hotels in this area, more than half write names like "Ms. Chen Yanqiu" or "Ms. Xiao Hongyu," and below it is noted "Long-term stay," which is a very skillful advertising method. Before the lunar new year, it was possible to play cards in the hotels, but now it is forbidden.

After the Changsha Municipal Government was merged with the County Government, the Police Bureau was transferred to the Provincial Government, with a Municipal Affairs Section attached to manage municipal affairs. Conscription, township insurance, relief money, and grain storage have recently been handled by the County Government. In the past, Changsha City was supposed to conscript 200 strong men per month, and Changsha County 1,000. Before and after the fire, the population dispersed, and now they are returning one after another, and re-conscription has begun. Last November and December, there were over a thousand insurance units and about 90,000 strong men in the county that should have been conscripted but were not. Now, over seven hundred insurance units are being handled, with an average of two men being conscripted per insurance unit per month. Up to now, a total of more than 14,000 people have been conscripted. The relief money for those who sacrificed for the country amounts to more than 100,000 yuan per year. However, because the troops are transferred indefinitely and the numbers are often changed, and some middle and senior officers are also transferred or martyred, the families of the conscripted are unable to investigate the survival of the conscripts or obtain proof of death in order to apply for relief. This matter concerns the advantages and disadvantages of the future of conscription, and the situation is the same everywhere, and the authorities seem to urgently need to find a solution. As for food, the losses during the fire were very large, and because the citizens are scattered in the countryside and there are many troops stationed in the county, it is now a slight problem. The provincial and county governments are issuing passports so that people can transport the rice and grain stored in neighboring counties back to regulate the supply.

After the rice was used for public expenses, it has now been transformed into military-civilian cooperation stations. In northern Hunan, there are currently four organized by the Political Department of the ×th War Zone and three organized by the local people. Their main task is to purchase firewood, rice, oil, and salt for the troops passing through, so as to avoid any trouble when the troops directly purchase from the people. Each station also has dozens of voluntary transportation teams, organized by local students and strong men, who carry wounded soldiers from station to station. However, the movement of troops also often requires labor. At first, it was easy for the county government to get dozens or hundreds of people, but later, because some troops did not allow the laborers to return home after arriving at a certain place, it is now more difficult. People criticize armies that do not burden the people as good armies. When the 89th Division passed through Changsha without needing laborers, several farmers talked to me about it. But when it comes to local work, the people still participate enthusiastically. For example, the national defense works near Changsha now have × thousand people working, and the destruction of railways and highways is also mostly due to their efforts.

March in Changsha has revived from the scorched earth, because the great Chinese nation is the most resilient to disasters and the most courageous in creation! (March 22, 1939, in Changsha.)

### England's Attitude Towards Poland Applauded by US and France If Germany Invades Poland, Resistance Will Be Decided Britain and Soviet Union Closely Discuss Aid to Poland

[Reuters, Washington, 31st] High-ranking authorities here have applauded the guarantees given to Poland by Britain and France, believing this to be the first unexpected effect of President Roosevelt strengthening the political cause of European democracies. This guarantee not only turns the shadows caused by Britain's policy toward Germany into a clear future, but also ends the criticism and distrust of the British government by some important American newspapers since the British government implemented this policy. The British and French guarantees to Poland undoubtedly caused British stocks to soar, especially at this critical moment when some senators, such as Bora, constantly attacked President Roosevelt's policy, claiming that Britain had no intention of resisting German aggression, and even tacitly approved of it. Such views can no longer generate any significant force, of course.

[Reuters, London, 31st] According to Reuters diplomatic correspondents, after the conclusion of mutual talks between Britain and other countries, the Prime Minister will issue another statement. Britain has reported the development of the situation to the United States in detail. Before Chamberlain's speech, the speech was also sent to Washington in advance. The authorities strongly stated that the Prime Minister's decision to issue a statement was entirely based on the general tense situation in Europe and the German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia, and not due to recent receipt of unfavorable news that was not released. The anti-Polish propaganda launched by the German press recently and the boiling of the Polish issue are roughly related to previous events. Especially today, things can change in an instant, causing a general feeling that there is no room for risky hope at this time. In Chamberlain's statement, he did not oppose the possibility of Polish-German negotiations on Danzig. On the contrary, the Prime Minister still strongly advocated that international negotiations should eliminate misunderstandings.

[Associated Press, London, 31st] After Chamberlain made a statement in the House of Commons, he immediately met with Lloyd George, who was the Prime Minister of Britain during the European War.

[Reuter, Paris, 1st] The French press praised the firm attitude of Britain, while also focusing on Poland's determination to maintain its independence. "Le Petit Parisien" stated that Britain's attitude is extremely important, and Romania will also receive similar guarantees as Poland. The fortress of security is being organized and is extremely successful, it said. Also, "Le Petit Journal" stated that if Poland obtains formal and definite guarantees from Britain, it is because Poland has decided to maintain its independence and is prepared to use force for defense.

[Associated Press, Paris, 1st] Chamberlain's official statement was greeted eagerly here. It is generally believed that this is a serious blow to Hitlerism. This declaration is a great contribution to the establishment of an anti-Hitler bloc.

[Reuters, London, 31st] The first reaction of the members of the House of Commons to the Prime Minister's announcement of guaranteeing Poland's independence was the firm support of the government faction and the goodwill of the opposition party, and the hope that the policy declared by the Prime Minister can develop along an appropriate path. The earliest impression that the statement gave to the general public was the relaxation of the tense situation in the past twenty-four hours. Chamberlain has gone to a country villa for the weekend, and most of the other important government officials have also left the capital, but they are all nearby and can be assembled immediately if necessary. The House of Commons international issue discussion will probably be held next Monday. According to the scheduled procedure, Greenwood and Dalton will be the main speakers for the Labor Party, and Chamberlain will be the main respondent for the government. Chamberlain's speech has given a very good impression to the stock exchange, and the market prices at the close were very high.

[Associated Press, London, 31st] Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration, which indicates a sudden change in British foreign policy, can be described as a surprising move unseen in nearly twenty years. Chamberlain declared that when European security talks are underway, if Poland's independence is threatened and Poland resists, Britain and France will immediately provide military assistance. He also stated that Britain is currently discussing this issue closely with the Soviet Union. After the declaration was issued, the government spokesperson stated that British and French military assistance may extend to the Polish Corridor and Danzig, because the Prime Minister clearly stated that Britain guarantees assistance in "any conflict." It is also learned that this decision by Britain will cause the German-Polish talks on the Polish Corridor and Danzig to be on the verge of breakdown. Chamberlain also stated in his declaration that the government has not yet obtained official confirmation of the rumors of an attack on Poland. The British government has always advocated resolving international disputes through negotiations. The visit of the Polish Foreign Minister to London next Monday will enable detailed discussions and obtain appropriate methods to stop aggression, etc.

The Status of Danzig Cannot Be Changed

[Reuters, Warsaw, 1st] It is believed that the Polish government has made it clear to the German government that any unilateral action regarding changing the status of Danzig will be regarded as an action that threatens Polish independence, as mentioned in the British declaration.

[Associated Press, Washington, 31st] According to people close to the government, "If Germany does not respect our borders, we will definitely resist." The official reaction to Chamberlain's declaration was unanimous elation, considering it to be a guarantee of "equal peace" for both Eastern and Western Europe, unlike the Locarno Treaty, which only focused on the West.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 31st] According to reliable sources, the rumor that military negotiations are underway is not true. Because if there is to be a meeting, it should be after Polish Foreign Minister Beck goes to England. Regarding Poland's naval strength, related parties stated that the Polish navy currently has four destroyers and three submarines. If it is to fight against Germany by sea, it must borrow money to increase warships and increase a large number of naval personnel, because the current Polish navy can only be used to patrol the Baltic Sea.

[Reuters, Rome, 1st] Newspapers here today published Chamberlain's declaration in a prominent position, but did not criticize it. The Rome correspondent of "Il Messaggero" stated that "Britain is bound to make further efforts against centralized countries."

[Central News Agency, Rome, 31st] After British Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a statement in the House of Commons today providing guarantees to Poland, Italian officials did not comment. Political figures were deeply impressed and said that this statement directly involved Poland and Germany, and Italy, because it maintains close friendship with each of these countries, is also extremely concerned. Some parties said that the uneasiness caused by Germany's annexation of the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia has not yet been resolved, and now the Polish issue has been provoked, which is a misunderstanding.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 31st] Sir Charles, the British Charge d'Affaires, visited Foreign Minister Ciano in the evening and told him about Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement issued in the House of Commons today providing guarantees to Poland. He then had further talks with Foreign Minister Ciano in the evening, but what was discussed was not announced. Foreign Minister Ciano also met with the Polish Ambassador, Trouyo New Key, for discussions.

### Hitler Delivers a Speech Greatly Annoyed by British Aid to Poland Frequent Military Activity on the German Border

[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] Hitler will deliver a speech at Weissheimseewen from 4:45 to 5:00 today (Greenwich Mean Time).

[Reuters, Berlin, 31st] It is heard that Hitler is extremely angry at Britain's manipulation of the Polish situation and Chamberlain's recent declaration. All well-informed authorities believe that Hitler will definitely respond with an extremely tough tone when speaking at Weissheimseewen tomorrow. There was frequent traffic in the Foreign Ministry tonight. It is believed that Hitler has ordered his secretary to completely re-draft the sentences concerning foreign policy in the speech. It is heard that Hitler has consulted with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Information Director Diettrich. The official attitude tonight is particularly cautious, and the propaganda department has criticized the release of Chamberlain's declaration. The first newspaper to publish the declaration was not found on the market until 10 pm. A strong anti-British activity occurred in the afternoon. Newspapers were ordered to specifically state that this incident was similar to the incident on May 21 last year and the rumor two weeks ago that Germany issued an ultimatum to Romania. Officials continue to vehemently deny reports of German troop movements. Warsaw car drivers claim that German military activity on the Polish-German border is quite frequent, but it is impossible to determine whether this activity exceeds normal conditions.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 1st] Today, the German 35,000-ton warship "Lien Bi Shi" was launched at Weissheimseewen Port. It is expected that Hitler will deliver an important speech at that time. However, it is believed that his speech draft will be completed while spending the night on a special train from Berlin to here. No one can predict how its content will express Chamberlain's declaration. It is generally believed that since the Munich Agreement, the principle of the Nazi Party's rule over Eastern Europe by the Germans has been possible. Chamberlain's declaration is the first direct attack, it is said.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 31st] The German government is currently studying Chamberlain's declaration carefully. It is generally believed that the declaration is extremely important. Before a detailed study, officials will not express their opinions for the time being. Hitler is scheduled to deliver a speech tomorrow, at which time the first reaction from the German officials can be obtained. It is generally believed that the German reaction can be in two ways: (1) extreme indignation, and a strong counterattack in the newspapers, ordering Britain not to interfere; (2) expressing indifference, because they have not yet threatened Poland's integrity. It is generally believed that the former attitude is more similar.

### German Commentary

[Associated Press, Berlin, 1st] The "Posen Times" published an article today, criticizing Chamberlain's declaration as another attempt to undermine peaceful relations, saying that this attempt is contemptible, and stating that Germany's plan to rule Central and Eastern Europe under Hitler's leadership will not be affected by external constraints. At the same time, the "Local Daily" also wrote a commentary saying that Chamberlain is playing with fire, and the guarantee to Poland is an impractical fantasy, because it has no new anti-German force.

[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] Morning newspapers here do not place much emphasis on the importance of Chamberlain's declaration, saying that the declaration did not make Germany feel the slightest unease. It is believed that the newspapers' toned-down criticism is being carried out under orders, so that Hitler's speech today can be even more shocking. "Völkischer Beobachter" stated, "Chamberlain's declaration, intentionally or unintentionally, expresses a tendency to poison German-Polish relations." Also, "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" stated, "Germany views this declaration as another new link in the chain of lack of understanding and sincerity."

[Reuters, Berlin, 31st] A German communications agency commented on Chamberlain's speech, "This kind of empty rhetoric still cannot hinder Germany's construction work in Central Europe." The communications agency also said that it was like a bolt from the blue, and it was deeply incomprehensible that Chamberlain made this announcement in an instant. "In fact, its content is not novel at all, because over the years, because of their alliance, Britain and France would assist Poland if it was attacked by foreign forces. This is something everyone knows. Chamberlain's deliberate disruption and the spread of an atmosphere of distrust of Germany is ridiculous. The suspicion that Germany will use force to invade others does not exist."

### Italian Prime Minister Broadcast Ready to Fight at Any Time

[Reuters, Lecce, 31st] Mussolini broadcast today, and the speech was covered by the cheers of the crowd. When he mentioned the phrase "people living across the Alps," the crowd taunted the person he was referring to. Mussolini said: "We are now preparing everything to defend ourselves. Strong countries are often rich, and weak countries are often poor. In the first stage of fascism, the situation was very obvious, but in the second stage, the results will be even greater than the first stage. The international community is like a family, and Italy is a first-class figure. I will speak on Sunday, so there is no need to say more now. People living across the Alps deny the facts and predict that the fascist people will separate, but the facts prove the opposite. The people under fascist rule are united more firmly every day." Mussolini ended his speech, almost covered by the cheers of the crowd. He said that Italy is like a young man, ready to fight at any time.

### British Political Developments The King of Romania Pays Close Attention Denies the Dismissal of the Minister to Hungary Hitler Receives the New Romanian Minister

[Haitong Agency, London, 1st] King Carol of Romania is paying close attention to the recent political developments in London. He has recently recalled the Second Secretary of the Romanian Embassy here, Dimansiqi, to report to the government. The Romanian Minister, Tieli Ya, left here last week for the capital of Hungary. The rumor that Tieli Ya has been dismissed has been denied. The reason for Tieli Ya's return to the country is unknown, and the date of his return is also undecided.

### Chen Youren's Remarks: Genuine Cooperation with the Soviet Union is Necessary to Effectively Counter Aggression

[Our Newspaper Exclusive] Recently, the Haitong News Agency released information stating that a certain retired U.S. military officer believes that the Soviet Union's current military strength is far inferior to that of the Tsarist era. This reporter, considering Mr. Chen Youren as a strong advocate for Sino-Soviet cooperation, took this matter up with him to seek his opinion.

Upon hearing the reporter's words, Mr. Chen immediately smiled and said, "Rather than believing the words of a certain retired U.S. military officer, it is better to believe the estimates of German military experts."

Mr. Chen showed the reporter an editorial from the Manchester Guardian dated February 27th, and pointed out several sections quoting German officers' opinions on the Soviet Union's military strength:

(1) German staff officer Wenzasak declared, "The Russian army's offensive power is growing daily, and the bravery and strength of Russian soldiers are undeniable."

(2) A key figure in the German Air Force, Mr. Smelder, stated, "Russia can manufacture 12,000 to 15,000 aircraft annually by 1940. If a major war breaks out, the Russian Air Force can deploy 20,000 aircraft. Furthermore, Russia can move its military industry to safe zones during wartime, immune from any threat."

(3) The 'Military Weekly,' published by the German Army, stated, "The number of aircraft in the Russian Air Force is undeniably the largest in the world."

(4) The 'Maritime News,' published by the German Navy, even recognized that "Russia's current submarine fleet surpasses that of any other country in terms of the number of vessels."

Mr. Chen also pointed out the conclusion of the Manchester Guardian, which stated, "Whether in Europe or the Far East, a strong Soviet Russia is a strong guarantee of peace."

Mr. Chen then slowly said: "The reason why Hitler can run rampant in Central Europe, and why young Japanese military officers can act recklessly and launch large-scale aggressions in China, is due to the failure of the authorities in China, Britain, and France to cooperate effectively with the Soviet Union in a timely manner. Today, if we want to effectively counter the threat of aggressor nations, the only way is to genuinely cooperate with the Soviet Union."

This has now been completed, and he is scheduled to return to his post tomorrow. It is reported that the Lithuanian government broke off relations with Poland after Vilnius was occupied by Polish troops in 1920 and only accepted Poland's ultimatum and restored normal diplomatic relations and railway transportation in March of last year after border disputes arose between the two countries.

### Australia and Canada Cannot Remain Neutral if Britain Goes to War

[Central News Agency, Melbourne, 1st] The Melbourne Sun reports that Chamberlain's declaration in the House of Commons yesterday clearly demonstrates that if Germany invades Poland, Australia will also be drawn into the vortex. Germany should finally understand that Britain is not bluffing and is indeed prepared for war.

[Central News Agency, Ottawa, 1st] Canadian Minister of Justice Lapointe stated in the House of Commons yesterday that if the United States goes to war, Canada will naturally not be able to remain neutral.

[Reuters, Wilhelmshaven, 1st] Thousands of people from various parts of Germany arrived here on fifty special trains and hundreds of cars to attend the launching ceremony of the 35,000-ton battleship "Tirpitz" and listen to Hitler's speech. Last night, naval units and military bands paraded through the crowded streets here, and the docks, shops, and houses were heavily decorated. The people were extremely excited. Several warships are currently docked here, and it is expected that more warships will participate. The "Robert Ley" is also among them. Hitler may board this ship for a short cruise. The tonnage of the third battleship in the plan is currently unknown. Authorities have hinted that it will be a 45,000-ton battleship named "Frederick the Great."

### Tunisian Storm (Continued)

— Translated by Yang Bi

This method of opening up history and settling old scores is naturally of no help to the overall situation. Moreover, now, haven't the French, Italians, Babbis, Moors, Jews, Arabs, and other natives all settled in Tunisia and lived in peace? Within Tunisia, the Italian people have their own sphere of influence. Many places have been completely Italianized. Even tourists in those places take on some Italian characteristics. People who have just gone to Tunisia often feel that there are more Italians than French, but this year's population survey points out that there are indeed more French than Italians. Italy will always object to the numbers in this survey. Her reason is that many Italian immigrants have been forced to become French citizens.

This kind of statistical dispute is, of course, tedious. The fact is that France has an administrative body in Tunisia. Tunisia is exceptionally prosperous under French management. Judging from this situation, who would believe that France would be willing to give it up? Of course, it is not necessarily impossible, but Britain would never allow her to give it up.

However, no matter what, Tunisia has indeed become a problem now. It is no longer possible to muddle along. Unless France simply cedes Tunisia to Italy to rule. In fact, Italy has long occupied a share of everything in Tunisia. There, Italy enjoys various privileges: autonomy, land rights, and national rights. In theory, France could have objected to these facts long ago, but no one dared to stand up and do so. Conversely, although Mussolini signed a peaceful agreement with Laval in 1935, he now dismisses it all in one breath, citing France's launch of "sanctions" as an excuse. Naturally, the problem will eventually have to unfold. Although France wants to hide, Italy is pressing hard.

How this problem will be solved is difficult for anyone to say now. But we believe that only harmony is the right path. We advise Mussolini not to imitate Hitler and threaten war again. You must know that the European battlements are already clearly different. Suffering is self-inflicted.

### Germany Hints Slovakia Make Concessions to Hungary, Details of Border Demarcation Expected to Be Resolved Tomorrow

[Reuters, Budapest, 31st] Slovakia and Hungary may agree to demarcate the entire border between Slovakia and Ruthenia. The final details will be resolved on April 3rd. Germany has made it clear to the Slovak authorities that they must make concessions, as Hungary's friendship is extremely important to Germany in the current situation.

[Central News Agency, Bratislava, 31st] Regarding the issue of border demarcation between Hungary and the Slovak state, the Hungarian government has submitted a memorandum of demands, requesting the state cede several areas and demanding a reply by noon today. The state government telegraphed the German government yesterday, requesting its intervention. According to responsible sources, the German government has ordered its envoy to Hungary, Mr. Ettmansson, to request the Hungarian government to cede several areas southeast of Bratislava to the Slovak state as a condition for the state's cession of land.

Current Affairs Commentary

### Wang Jingwei's "Example"

We will not dwell on what impression the name Wang Jingwei makes in the minds of every patriotic and courageous Chinese person. The fact that Wang Jingwei is still freely publishing his writings today is bound to arouse the hatred and anger of every patriotic citizen, which is an inevitable reality. However, we do not wish to comment on it either. What we are still willing to discuss, even at the risk of staining our ink, is a lengthy article entitled "An Example" by Wang Jingwei, published in the ×× Daily yesterday, which catered to the wishes of the Japanese aggressors, sowed discord among our nation's unity, and undermined the trust between our government, political parties, and the people!

Wang Jingwei's article begins by excusing Zeng Zhongming's neglect of his duties [×××××××××] and praising him for "dying for national affairs." There are many such "examples" that reverse right and wrong; this is not the first time, so we will not discuss them in detail. The article then writes about the "records" of the "54th Standing Committee Meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council," saying that in December 1937 (note! when Chairman Chiang was leading the war effort in Nanjing, Jingwei convened a meeting in Hankou), Xu Mo reported in detail on the negotiations with German Ambassador Trautmann on resolving the Sino-Japanese War. We must adopt an absolutely reserved attitude as to whether this "record" is reliable or whether Xu Mo's report in the record is truly the case. However, even if everything cited in Jingwei's article is completely reliable, it only says that Germany, a helper of Japan at the time, sent its ambassador to China to conduct so-called mediation with our authorities. A small number of pro-Japanese elements such as Jingwei also gladly supported this matter in order to help Japan subdue China, but the result was that our authorities refused. No matter how hard traitors and collaborators try to insist that certain government leaders also agreed to peace talks, facts speak louder than words! At that time, the Japanese aggressors used international helpers and collaborators in China to carry out the conspiracy of peaceful inducement, but it was ruthlessly defeated because our highest leader accepted the public opinion of the people! Wang Jingwei still wants to slander the leader and drag people into the water today, even writing three so-called questions, but because of the fact that our leader unites the country and insists on resisting the war, his words are aimless and become a self-defeating "example"!

Following this, Jingwei's article contains what is called "a word for the people" and what is called "a major plan for war and peace." We, the people, have long been tired of hearing this. We may still briefly point out its errors one by one. First, Wang claims: "If the conditions do not affect the nation's survival and independence, what is wrong with advocating peace?" Then why did Czechoslovakia last year negotiate peace with Germany, and even have the Munich Agreement in which Germany, Britain, and France guaranteed its survival and independence, only to suffer the disaster of destruction today? Does the advocate of peace want our country to suffer a second Czechoslovakia? Second, he claims "Using resistance as a means of internal unification is something I absolutely oppose; advocating peace will not hinder unification, and not advocating peace will not lead to division." In fact, China seeks liberation through resistance and has unification, not "using resistance as a means of internal unification." The traitorous surrenderers distort the sacred meaning of resistance, even openly oppose unification, and advocate division. Their loyalty to Japan can be called true. Third, he falsely accuses the Communist Party of having a nature of creating chaos, but in fact, the Xi'an Incident was calmed and unification was promoted through the efforts of the Communist Party. Moreover, since the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party has faithfully obeyed the leader, led the people, and insisted on resisting the war. Jingwei should also know that the facts are obvious, but if he does not slander the Communist Party, how can he win the favor of Japan? I think Jingwei has no choice but to engage in "an example" of such behavior! In addition to the above, the following paragraphs in Jingwei's article are all verbatim copies of Japanese propaganda, such as "What I sincerely and wholeheartedly seek is a grand plan for East Asia for a hundred years," which is really not worth staining my ink. Finally, he finally revealed the true intention of writing this article! He said, "I have heard that the National Government (this is the tone the Japanese use to refer to our central government) is working hard to promote international mediation, which is acceptable. However, at least international mediation and direct negotiations should proceed simultaneously. In this way, I can assist from the sidelines in my capacity as an unofficial figure, which would not be without help." So it turns out that he still wants China and Japan to hold "direct negotiations" so that he can play the role of a pro-Japanese figure and "assist from the sidelines." In fact, the so-called "National Government is working hard to promote international mediation" is originally a malicious rumor created by Japan, which has already been refuted and denounced by Minister Chen Cheng. Now Wang has repeated the old rumor, which can be said to be a good understanding of Japan's intentions! I don't know what kind of "example" this is for the people!

However, this is not just a simple article, nor is it just "an example" of Jingwei exposing his ugliness. We must know that the Japanese aggressive military forces are sinking deeper and deeper into the mire and are eagerly seeking political conspiracies to extricate themselves. Recently, they deliberately spread rumors of international mediation and exaggerated the change in Sino-German relations, aiming only to weaken the prestige of our government among the people and internationally. Their purpose of sowing discord among our domestic unity and international relations is only to stop China's united resistance in order to realize peaceful inducement and conquer China. Jingwei can be said to anticipate the wishes of the Japanese and has fully displayed his abilities!

### Hong Kong Military Authorities Add Defensive Works in the New Territories, Large Amounts of Sandbags Piled Up in Strategic Locations in Shatin, Barbed Wire Nets Arranged for Several Miles Along the Coast

In light of the increasingly dangerous international situation, the Hong Kong military authorities are seeking to strengthen their naval, land, and air forces. In addition to constructing barracks, air raid shelters, and air defense rooms in Kowloon, and creating a naval district on the sea surface in the Aberdeen area, the authorities are also setting up defensive works in various areas. It is learned that the authorities, in order to prevent any unforeseen circumstances, have recently dispatched a large number of military personnel to the key points of the New Territories to pile up large amounts of sandbags to guard against any eventuality, and especially to pay attention to Shatin. Because the seabed near that area is very shallow, especially the seashore to the right of Shatin Station, barbed wire nets have recently been placed in the Shatin area, such as "Che Kung Temple," for several miles, and the consolidation is very meticulous. Also, Hong Kong's air defense training is currently being carried out vigorously. In addition to the Central District Section Instructor having scheduled to start classes at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce on the 4th of this month, other districts will also open classes in turn. It is estimated that the training can be completed entirely in the summer of this year. Regarding the responsibilities of these air defense instructors, many are not fully understood. It is learned that the responsibilities of these instructors are purely in the form of social service. After training, the members of each district will designate the position they will serve in. Each position will have six or eight instructors, with four or six men and one or two women. One person will be recommended as the squad leader to be responsible for the affairs of this position. In the event of an air raid during an emergency period, they will come out to serve, and they will guide citizens on how to avoid air raids, such as entering air raid shelters or prohibiting pedestrians and controlling lights. If there is any bombing, they will notify the fire or ambulance personnel. Each air defense post is equipped with defensive materials such as sandbags, so the position of the air defense personnel is actually safer than that of ordinary people. It is also learned that there were originally more than 6,000 guide instructors in the Central District Section A. After the decision to open classes, yesterday, more than 20 people registered as volunteers to be air defense instructors, but most of them were men. It is hoped that women with a passion for serving the social masses will rise up and join.

### This Year's Children's Day Celebration Will Be Unprecedentedly Grand, 80,000 National Flags Have Been Issued to Raise Funds for Refugee Children, Hundreds of Refugee Children from the War Zone Will Participate in the Commemoration

The Hong Kong Kowloon Education Sector Joint Commemoration Preparatory Committee for "April 4th" Children's Day held its second meeting yesterday, with Committee Members Xie Feilie and Liang Shikuan reporting on the progress of the preparations. It was briefly stated that this year's Children's Day celebration will be grander and more meaningful than any previous year. The success of the flag donation campaign will exceed our expectations. The small national flags issued since the day before yesterday have reached 80,000 schools. Unfortunately, due to the short time, not enough could be produced, and the goal of universal distribution could not be achieved.

Donating National Flags Instead of Gifts

Last year's Children's Day had a program of giving each other gifts. This move can also train children's spirit of universal love. However, this year, selling flags allows children to commemorate this country, which is in a serious national crisis, by loving the national flag. Secondly, it can raise funds to relieve refugee children in the war zone, achieving two goals with one action. Currently, the schools that have received the national flags, with more than 1,000 flags, include: Lingdao, Guanghua, Guangzhong, Zhixing Chonglan, Southwest, Yangzhong, Lingdong, Overseas Chinese, Meifang, Nanyang, Xinjian, Confucius Society, and South China. The remaining schools are also going to receive flags one after another. At the same time, this preparatory committee has notified all schools that in addition to students receiving them themselves, they can also send them to parents. The love of children and the love of the country will be fully expressed on this day.

Hundreds of Refugee Children from the War Zone to Participate

As for the order of the meeting and the recreational program (in the Queen's Entertainment and Two Theaters in the Hong Kong area), the Secretary for Chinese Affairs has agreed. The number of the presidium of the conference is set at 20 for Entertainment and 14 for Queen's. The schools have already reported their lists. Approximately 3,000 students from the Hong Kong area will participate. In addition, hundreds of refugee children from the Wartime Child Care Association will participate. More than 20 schools will participate in various programs. The declaration of the conference (i.e., the opening speech) has been approved by the Secretary for Chinese Affairs.

### Hong Kong Government Revenue Increased in February, Revenue Reached More Than 2.95 Million Yuan

The revenue from government property, however, slightly decreased, totaling 52,778.30 yuan, a reduction of approximately 3,000 yuan. In the first two months of this year, the total expenditure was 6,270,758.13 yuan, compared to 5,520,922.32 yuan last year.

### Student Relief Association to Hold Third Election Today, Noon at YMCA Auditorium, Choir Recruiting New Members to Participate

The terms of office of the executive committee of the Hong Kong Student Relief Association have expired according to the charter, and the third election will be held today. In order to achieve satisfactory results in the election, the association has established an election committee to prepare for all election matters and has drafted a draft charter for the next term so that it can be submitted for discussion at the delegates' meeting.

### Nanyang Mechanics Enthusiastically Patriotic, 600 People Will Arrive in Hong Kong, The Largest Number of People Returning Home to Serve in the Past, Returned Home from Singapore on the Toyohira Wheel on the 27th

Since the outbreak of the full-scale war of resistance, our overseas Chinese have been concerned about their homeland, donating large amounts of money to the country to relieve refugees. More people have voluntarily quit their jobs and returned home to serve. This patriotic spirit is highly admirable. It is learned that there have been two groups of mechanics from Singapore and other ports in Nanyang who have returned home to work in Chongqing. It is learned that the third batch has also set off in Singapore on the 27th of last month and is expected to arrive in Hong Kong during the day.

### Queen's Road Central: Three Dancers' Clothes Destroyed by Acid, Police Take Seriously and Investigate Closely

On Queen's Road Central, three cases occurred within eight hours yesterday where dancers had their clothes destroyed by acid. In one case, a dancer's foot was injured. The police are taking the case quite seriously and are investigating based on the statements of the three dancers. One of the dancers, Ma Baolian (20 years old), residing at 43 Hennessy Road, was in front of the Queen's Theatre at 7:30 PM the night before when her modern long gown was suddenly destroyed by acid. A large hole was burned in the bottom of the back of her dress. The perpetrator fled and has not been located. At 9:30 PM, another incident occurred on Chiu Lung Street. A dancer named Bai Lianzhu (25 years old), residing at 11 Wing Sing Street, 2nd floor, was returning to the dance hall via Chiu Lung Street when a man suddenly splashed acid on her body. The clothes she was wearing were completely destroyed. Then, at 3:00 AM yesterday morning, a dancer named He Hanying (19 years old) was returning home from work, walking along Queen's Road, when a person suddenly approached and stopped her, and without a word, destroyed her clothes with acid. She tried to dodge, resulting in an acid burn to her foot.

### This Newspaper's Second Film and Drama Weekly Symposium: Welcome to the Chinese Drama Troupe

— Qi Zhuo

Held Yesterday at Huanle Garden in Kowloon City

Hearts are beating, and hot tears are welling up in eyes. In a mix of gratitude and remorse, everyone vaguely realizes that they must be reborn and become the children of the Chinese nation that are needed. The gains from this gathering are truly abundant.

The fact is this: Yesterday at noon, this newspaper's Film and Drama Weekly held its second film and drama symposium at Huanle Garden in Kowloon, and welcomed the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe. In addition to the fervently welcomed Jin Shan, Wang Ying, and Lin Shu, three warriors, attendees included pioneers and enthusiastic workers from the film and drama industry, such as Cai Chusheng, Fei Mu, Situ Huimin, Fu Jiao, Zhao Yingcai, Tang Ruoqing, Li Qing, Huang Dacai, Zhu Baishui, Li Shulun, and others. (Mr. Ouyang Yuqian was unable to attend due to other commitments, and Mr. Hu Chunbing was unable to attend due to illness.) The scenery outside the garden is so quiet and fresh, a rare scenic spot in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Inside the garden, dozens of enthusiastic and progressive cultural workers are conversing so intimately. This symbolizes another side of Hong Kong.

Mr. Lu Fu delivered a speech first, turning the individual conversations into a symposium, discussing the importance of film and drama at the current stage and expressing our highest respect and warm welcome to the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe. In such a warm welcome, the handsome and lively Mr. Jin Shan began to move the hearts of those present.

"I am truly touched by the hard work of the gentlemen in Hong Kong. We must first pay our respects to you all! In a state of high excitement, what I want to say is disorganized, let me say whatever comes to mind.

"We have been engaged in the national salvation drama movement since we left Shanghai on August 13th, which has been a full nineteen months now. We are learning in the great era, and there is no waste of time. From our personal experience, we feel very optimistic. Optimistic about what? In simple terms: China can be saved."

——Mr. Jin Shan said excitedly and repeatedly that China can be saved. He cited many facts to prove that this is not an abstract slogan or a self-consoling statement.

Then, Mr. Jin enthusiastically reported on their work in the mainland over the past year, which was truly inspiring. Mr. Lin Shu also reported on his experiences participating in combat. When he spoke of the bravery of the soldiers, he couldn't help but shed tears, which deeply resonated with everyone's hearts. Ms. Wang Ying added that one would not believe the progress of China unless one went to the front lines. The cooperation between the military and the people is really great. The war of resistance is growing on one hand and destroying on the other. Although it is painful at the moment, the future is absolutely optimistic.

After listening to the reports of the three warriors from the front lines, Cai Chusheng immediately stood up and said what many people wanted to say: "I am so ashamed that I should commit suicide, I feel that I should immediately return to the embrace of the motherland." He continued to talk about the future of drama. Mr. Fei Mu also couldn't help but say that we should immediately launch a call:

Those engaged in culture who remain in Hong Kong should state their reasons for staying, and produce work, otherwise, they should jump into the sea from Wangtai.

We should be the backing for the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe in Hong Kong, enabling them to march overseas. Now, let us discuss how to help them.

Mr. Situ Huimin also offered some insightful remarks on strengthening the movement against cultural traitors and future liaison work.

In addition: Lu Dun, Li Qing, Ye Jian, Li Shulun, and others also expressed their opinions. Finally, concrete methods were discussed, which was truly a great gain.

Hearts are beating, and hot tears are welling up in eyes. In a mix of gratitude and remorse, everyone vaguely realizes that jumping into the sea from Wangtai is a sign of weakness, and that being reborn and becoming the children of the Chinese nation that are needed is the great path we should take.

### China Travel Service Regular Charity Performance

Raising Funds for the Women's Four-Association Alliance

Recently, members of the China Travel Service Drama Troupe, Tang Ruoqing and Tang Ruoying, proposed a charity performance to the four women's associations in Hong Kong to provide relief to refugees. The four women's associations held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Women's War Relief Association to discuss this matter. Many people attended, including He Yuzhen (Chairman), Wang Xiaoying, Huang Yang Ruolan, and Xi Xiuzhen. It was resolved to accept the proposal and to name it the "Hong Kong Women's Joint Council" charity performance to raise funds for comforting soldiers at the front. It will last for three consecutive days, with the performance venue set at the Lee Theatre. The performance work will be handled by the Comfort Association, the ticket sales group by the War Relief Association, the public relations group by the New Movement Association, the accounting group by the Women's Association, the affairs group by the Young Women's Association, the documentation group by the Moderation Association, the decoration group by the Promotion Association, and the publicity group by the Women's Comfort Association. Ticket prices are set at ten dollars, five dollars, two dollars, and one dollar. The next meeting will be held on the 5th, it is said.

### Adapting to the Needs of the Times: Four More Gas Mask Factories Established, Daily Production of 500 Masks to Meet Market Demand

Due to the advancement of the times, human warfare has progressed from a plane to a three-dimensional one. Aerial destruction is the greatest enemy of mankind. All countries in the world are diligently working on air defense and anti-gas measures, especially focusing on anti-gas measures. Gas masks are an important guarantee of life in wartime. The Hong Kong government has been ordering large quantities from the UK in recent years to ensure sufficient supply during wartime. In addition, several rubber manufacturers on the market are also manufacturing gas masks for sale, and their products are selling well. Recently, four gas mask factories have been established in Hong Kong to meet the needs of the times. Products will be available in a few weeks, and it is said that a total of 500 masks can be manufactured daily. Among them, two factories already have a small number of products. These four manufacturers have received orders from the Chinese government for civilian gas masks, and their work has been progressing very actively recently.

### Tense Situation on the Western Front, Cost of Living Higher in Hong Kong, Fish Three Times More Expensive, Firewood as Expensive as Cassia Twigs

Due to the impact of the Jiangmen battle near Hong Kong, the supply of freshwater fish has been cut off from Jiangmen, and very little is coming from Zhongshan, so the price of fish continued to rise yesterday. Ling fish is more than 20 cents per catty, and large fish and whole fish are more than 40 cents, about twice as much as before the Jiangmen battle. Hong Kong's fish supply is divided into freshwater and saltwater fish. After the fall of Guangzhou, freshwater fish relied solely on supplies from Jiangmen and Zhongshan, amounting to 300 to 400 dan per day. According to news from the fruit industry, a large batch of vegetables arrived in Hong Kong from Shantou yesterday, so although supplies from Jiangmen have stopped, market prices have not risen too much. Regarding firewood, due to the reduction in ships traveling from Singapore, supplies have been greatly reduced. Previously, four ships, the Meinan, Meixi, Anshun, and Anhui, carried Singapore firewood to Hong Kong. Currently, only the Anshun and Anhui remain. Now, due to the impact of the war on the western front, firewood from the upper reaches of the West River cannot be transported to Hong Kong, so firewood prices have risen even further. The current wholesale price of ordinary firewood is $1.70 per 70 catties, and the retail price is only 60 catties. In addition, Lin Jiajun, the former chairman of the Student Relief Association, has been hired as the newspaper's manager to actively promote various tasks. It is said that the current issue contains a special article by Mr. Tao Xingzhi on overall education and overall resistance. Other sections include reading clubs, new women, and student clubs. The cartoon special issue and the amateur life weekly are particularly characteristic of the newspaper. It is said that the cartoon section is edited by famous young cartoonists Zheng Jiazhen and Lin Qin from Hong Kong.

### Student Newspaper Resumes Publication Today, Expanded Pages with Large Format, Increased Cartoon Content, Rich and Varied

The student newspaper founded by student leaders Xia Jiehua and Zheng Zhihuan in Hong Kong was suspended last month due to various obstacles. It is now ready and will resume publication today, expanding its pages and printing on a large format. To enrich the content and refresh the work, the newspaper has commissioned experts to write special articles for each section.

### Registration of British Residents Officially Begins Tomorrow, Registration Forms Have Been Sent Out Separately, Most Attention Paid to Mechanical Engineering Talent

The Residents Registration Ordinance (all British residents residing in Hong Kong are subject to this ordinance) was passed by the Legislative Council yesterday (30th) at the third reading and will be implemented. British citizens between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five must register with the authorities in accordance with the ordinance. The Hong Kong government has now decided that tomorrow (3rd) will be the official start date for registration, and it must be completed within two months. The reporter visited the commissioner in charge of registration yesterday. It is said that all registrants must fill out the form clearly, preferably in English block letters, so as not to cause any obstacles during the sorting and cataloging process. Those with mechanical engineering qualifications should be sure to specify their level of experience and the types of machines they are familiar with. For the convenience of registrants, the police station has sent registration forms to various signed commercial firms for distribution to employees who need to register. At the same time, the forms will be mailed separately to registrants, but the police will not be responsible for any omissions. Each registrant is responsible for obtaining this registration form. The post office and the Chun Tin Hang Residents Registration Sub-office are distributing them.

### Kwangtung Wounded and Arrives in Hong Kong, Passengers Describe Encountering Danger in Detail, General Xiafei Sunk a Sailboat Before the Accident

After the British post ship Kwangtung and the French post ship Zhenfei collided in fog outside Hong Kong the day before yesterday, the Zhenfei arrived back in Hong Kong at about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, unloaded passengers and cargo, and entered the Taikoo Dockyard for repairs. The Kwangtung also arrived at the Kowloon Wharf at about 9:00 PM in the evening. The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company decided to transfer the Zhidulu to replace the European route to avoid delays, as the ship needs to be docked for repairs. The Zhidulu is scheduled to depart at 10:00 AM tomorrow. The Kwangtung's starboard side

was most severely damaged

by the Zhenfei's bow in a "　　" shape, denting in. The iron railings on the second-floor corridor were also destroyed. The third-floor wound penetrated deep, reaching the inner wall of the passenger cabin. The fourth-floor was the most severely damaged, especially the pilot's room. One minute before the accident, the pilot, Mr. Irwin, was having breakfast in the room. He unintentionally looked out the window and suddenly saw a giant ship coming sideways. Knowing it was a bad omen, he rushed out of the room. There was a loud bang, and the disaster occurred. Afterwards, he looked back at the room, which was full of seawater, as the hole was seeping in continuously. The radius of the hole reached twelve feet. The furniture in the room...

Completely Destroyed

If Mr. Irwin had not rushed out in time, he would have hardly escaped. Fragments of the French post ship's anchor also fell into the room. The destroyed part of the fifth floor was the ice compartment, but fortunately, it was not penetrated. The shipowner, Mr. Morton, declined to comment on the accident, but said that the ship was not in danger of sinking. The passenger who saw the accident most clearly was Mr. Henderson of the Yves Saint Laurent perfume factory in London. Mr. Henderson was walking on the deck at the time and described the accident as follows: After breakfast, he went out on the side of the ship and leaned on the railing to look into the distance. He had already seen the French post ship approaching, but as he was not a navigator, he could not estimate the distance. However, he did not expect that

A Collision Would Occur

He had not yet finished thinking when the ship rushed straight towards his ship. He knew that there was no hope at this time. As he panicked, the other ship was only about twenty feet away. He quickly retreated, holding onto the cabin door to avoid falling. As expected, there was a violent jolt, and he lost his senses. Fortunately, he did not see any strange changes for a long time. He rushed to inspect and saw the French ship swaying and unstable, seemingly about to capsize. But in the end, it was able to hold on. At this time, the alarm bells rang loudly, and many passengers grabbed life jackets and went out to look at the lifeboats, which were also ready to be launched. Fortunately, all the passengers on the ship were exceptionally calm. After about an hour, the shipowner announced that there was no danger, and everyone returned to their cabins with peace of mind. The accident occurred at 8:50 AM. The crew members were able to handle the incident calmly, which was commendable. As for the French post ship

General Rofer

The damage was lighter. The ship needs to be docked for repairs, which will take fifteen days to complete. According to Zhu Desi, a Dutch passenger on the ship, before the accident, at about 8:00 AM that day, the ship mistakenly hit and sank a Chinese sailboat. At that time, the ship stopped to teach lifeboat drills. Unfortunately, the fog was heavy and the waves were large, and only broken pieces of the boat were seen, and the people were gone. After searching for a long time, knowing that there was no hope, they continued north. About an hour later, this disaster occurred.

### Welcome to the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe Roundtable

Minutes of the Second Film and Drama Roundtable

Time:

12:00 noon on the 1st of this month

Location:

Kowloon City, Kar Lin Gardens

Organizer:

Shen Bao Film and Drama Weekly

Participants:

What is a road? It is what is trodden out from a place where there was no road. It can only be opened up from a place full of thorns.

The New Film and Drama

In China's culture, there was originally no road for drama. If there was, it belonged to a product of construction, only for the appreciation of a minority of people, never thinking of going among the masses. Since the new drama movement unfolded, it, like the Chinese nation's revolution, shouldered the heavy task of opposing imperialism and feudalism. After the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War broke out, the eyes of the whole world were focused on the life-and-death struggle of the Chinese nation. From that time on, the new drama movement became an important department of the new cultural movement in China. The new drama movement, like the military, became more solid day by day and more progressive day by day. A group of progressive drama workers left the cities and formed dozens of teams to go to the front lines, to the countryside, to the rear, everywhere发挥ing the artistic task of drama to publicize to the masses and educate the masses. The content and form have been rapidly improved, closely coordinating with the needs of the war of resistance, bravely shouldering the great tasks of the new era, and forming the most progressive and strongest department in the anti-Japanese cultural movement.

The Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe is the most diligent and heroic elite force in this department. They were originally the Second Wartime Performing Troupe of the Shanghai Drama Circle National Salvation Association. Since August 13th, they have left Shanghai to promote the cause in various places, successively passing through Suzhou, Nanjing, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Macheng, and later going south along the Yuehan Railway, turning into Hunan and entering Guangxi. Along the way, they used drama and singing to educate the masses, mobilize the masses, and publicize to the masses. Because of the seriousness of their lives and the diligence of their work, they were praised and welcomed by military and political authorities and people from all walks of life everywhere. Now they have expanded their national salvation propaganda overseas and are appealing to overseas Chinese on behalf of the soldiers on the front lines. They have decided to go to Singapore, the Philippines, and Xiangshan in Southeast Asia to perform dramas, give lectures, and exhibit films.

The Significance of the Roundtable

In order to further connect feelings and start collective discussions; and to express our respect for the troupe, this journal took this opportunity yesterday—see the special report in this newspaper—to hold the second film and drama roundtable, and at the same time welcome Mr. Jinshan, the head of the troupe, Ms. Wang Ying, the deputy head of the troupe, and Mr. Lin Shu, a military expert who accompanied them to comfort overseas Chinese. Everyone took their seats around 12 noon. The host, Lu Fu, stood up to speak, and the general idea was as follows:

——Ladies and gentlemen, comrades, today is the second tea party of the Shen Bao Film Roundtable. (Omitted) Originally, this roundtable was planned to be held every two or three weeks, but since the first meeting was held on January 25, almost two months have passed. This is because everyone's work is very busy, especially the workers in our own newspaper, who are extremely busy. I am really sorry. The significance of holding this roundtable this time is, in addition to being the same as last time, to welcome the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe to Hong Kong on their way to promote the cause abroad, and to express our respect. At the same time, there are a few points of view that I would like to put forward here. Second: I hope that the leaders of the troupe can provide information on their national salvation drama movement and experiences from all over the country over the past year or so, for our reference and lessons in our work; Second point: I hope that all the advanced comrades present, based on their valuable experience and strict training, will conduct a heated discussion on the practical problems of the national salvation movement at this stage, especially in the special environment of Hong Kong; Although the working methods in the country can fully adapt to this special place, their working experience can give us many valuable references and strict training; Third: We hope that all the advanced comrades present will, in addition to extending the feelings of brothers and sisters who have returned from the war to the troupe and warmly welcoming them, also provide more practical assistance in their work for the sake of the entire drama movement and for the entire national liberation struggle, so that they can achieve the results they deserve.

Amidst applause, Lu Fu sat down, and at the same time, amidst applause, Mr. Jinshan stood up.

Mr. Jinshan was polite and frank, but when he spoke, he was eloquent and talked non-stop. Mr. Jin spoke a lot, and what is recorded here is only a part of it, and it is a general meeting.

Mr. Jinshan's words

Mr. Jin's first point is: Because of the nineteen months of the war of resistance, we have gained an experience. That is: China is happy and optimistic, and China has a way to do things. The process of nineteen months has told us many iron-like things that the war of resistance will surely be victorious. Overseas Chinese attach importance to organizing resistance and supporting the military. After the victory in the future, the government will definitely answer overseas Chinese and protect overseas Chinese. The second point is: I am an actor, let's talk about acting. In the past, in the city, I could perform a city youth: but I couldn't perform a farmer. Farmers are taller and bigger than Mr. Li Qing present, and their personalities and actions all have personality. Now that I have contacted them, I know, I believe I can act, although I can't be exactly like them, but I can be like a few points, and can be like a few points.

Lessons in Practice

Mr. Jin repeated his speech, paused for two pauses, and continued:——This time running into the mainland is much stronger than entering university. There are many new drama people who are better than us. This is a real feeling, not empty talk. They are convinced that the war of resistance will be victorious, they understand politics, they understand the international situation, and they contribute everything with the greatest enthusiasm. For example, when a devil comes, he kills the devil. This genuine expression is more real than ours and makes me moved to tears. The emotions of their people when performing dramas are all from the inside out, so it is particularly easy to touch the military masses. What they express is to learn from the real experience in real life.

Future Drama Movement

, the internal harm is aimed at the requirements of the masses; second, make good use of the old forms to enter the new content; third, the private lives of the staff must be serious; fourth, be sincere and refined; fifth, thorough political understanding.

——After Mr. talked about the points that should be paid attention to in the future drama movement, he seriously explained that we have such good soldiers, such good masses, and such good young people, so China really has a way to do it. Therefore, we must go to Southeast Asia in particular to let overseas Chinese know that the money and efforts they have put in will not be wasted; they will definitely be rewarded in the future.

"I hope that after going to Southeast Asia, I can realize the establishment of wounded soldier reception stations, reception centers, cultural supply stations, and arts and crafts centers in the motherland to accommodate the families of disabled soldiers and the families of fallen soldiers..."

Finally, Mr. Jin said, "This is not a matter for one person or one group, but the current task of the entire cultural circle. We are just a sentinel, willing to die rather than be timid, and ask you to be our backing."

It is the true feelings of family ruin and death. Their progress and their strength are really amazing. China's emerging drama is entrusted to these new fighters. I deeply feel that the set of stage techniques, lines, and the beauty of posture that I studied in the past are useless. They do not contain the masses. Therefore, we also followed him.

Mr. Lin's Words

Then Mr. Lin Shu reported a little bit about military stories. The most touching was:

——In a certain place, the local people's headquarters asked: "Is it true that we are leaving tomorrow?" I wondered why military news was known to someone. So I called the squad leaders to hold a roundtable meeting, and I learned that the soldiers gave everything to the villagers the day before they left, because they were determined to die, and when the masses saw this situation, they knew that they were being transferred.

From this, it proves the soldiers' willingness to sacrifice. This spirit is the guarantee of victory.

Ms. Wang Ying's words

Ms. Wang Ying's words are like this; we have been progressing, this war of resistance, while growing; while dying out, all the corrupt things have been eliminated in the artillery fire, and finally she said that the cooperation between the military and the people is the symbol and the proof of victory.

In Shameful Endeavor

Then Cai started to speak, and every sentence was painful. There are two main points: First, drama should not be regarded as an appreciation product for the upper class by only recognizing senior Chinese. Instead, it should go deep into the masses. At the same time, strengthen the united front and strengthen political understanding. Second: Avoid empty theories in content, tell the truth, and say things that can resonate with the masses. The content should be bloody and fleshy and reflect reality. He also solemnly said: Standing from the perspective of the country, military affairs are the first and victory is the first. Standing from the perspective of drama, the effect should be the first. If after a performance, the effect of education and political action is not achieved, no matter how much you study the background, posture, stage technology, and other superficial things, you will lose the true value of drama. Just as Mr. Lu Fu said, going to the restaurant and ballroom after leaving the theater is unacceptable. The correct worldview and political understanding of the expression of skills are the backbone of drama. Fei Mu's opinion is like this; the drama people who stay in Hong Kong should go back immediately if they have no work; otherwise, they should start working immediately to answer the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe. Situ Huimin attacked film merchants for falsely claiming that anti-Japanese films were banned in Southeast Asia, and asked the troupe to conduct a thorough investigation in Southeast Asia so that they could have a correct assessment of the objective environment. Are anti-Japanese films banned? Are even those that oppose traitors in the rear banned? Are even those that don't talk about Chinese people loving China banned? At the same time, he advocated strict criticism of cultural traitors and toxic films. Lu Dun also gave a detailed account of Hong Kong drama, and especially pointed out that it is wrong for Hong Kong drama to be in intellectual circles. He also criticized toxic films and said that he can still be saved, hoping that everyone will wake up. Li Qing said that he would rather starve to death than make toxic films, and expressed his respect for Jinshan. Every sentence was cautious and serious. Fei Mu said that he had something to do, and everyone applauded. Zhao Yingcai also advocated purging toxic films.

In the enthusiastic atmosphere, the meeting lasted for several hours before it ended with photos and tea.

### We Are Moving in One Direction

— Wang Ying

This war of resistance is a national war externally and a revolutionary war internally. On the one hand, it is tending to death, but on the other hand, it is growing up.

Today, no matter the front or the rear, the importance and significance of work are the same. When I arrived at ××, although I couldn't smell the gunpowder, the difficulties and obstacles in the work were incomparable to those on the battlefield. The spirit of people working optimistically and freely on the battlefield, when I arrived at ×× and saw the respectable friends, working hard in suffocation, moved me.

We are friends, comrades, our × people are common, our goals are consistent, and we are moving in one direction——to dedicate everything to the country and the war of resistance!

March 31st, Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe

### Welcome to the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe!

In the past, the Chinese spoken drama movement was only in the circles of urban intellectuals and citizens. It never really went to the masses. Therefore, although the Chinese spoken drama movement has had a considerable history, it has not grown beautiful fruit and has not received the support and love of the broad society and the broad masses; it has only succeeded in being like an antique in an ivory tower, only gaining the appreciation of a few so-called wise people after tea and dinner!

However, since the start of the sacred national self-defense war, the spoken drama movement has gained a new opportunity for rebirth, opened up a new way of life, truly moved towards the masses, and penetrated into the countryside, where it established people's drama!

The "Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe" is one of the workers in this field. They started from the largest city in China—Shanghai, abandoned the comfortable urban life, ran to the inland, and even ran to the war zone, risking their lives in dangerous areas full of gunpowder for the motherland!

On the one hand, they are serving the motherland, using their tools—drama—to arouse the masses' enthusiasm for resisting ×, and even to organize the masses to serve the war of resistance; on the other hand, they are working hard for the construction of the future Chinese spoken drama movement, gaining experience from the war of resistance, and learning from the broad masses to lay the foundation for the creation of the new Chinese drama!

Under these two important meanings, the hard work of the "Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe" comrades is worthy of our respect, especially their spirit of hard work, courage, and sacrifice, which should be learned by the young people who are hiding in the rear.

Now, the "Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe" has come to Hong Kong, but they are not retreating, let alone escaping, but it is the beginning of their new work!

They are going overseas to tell the heroic stories of the war of resistance they have obtained from the war zone, especially the belief that final victory will surely belong to us, which has been proven by various experiences, and to strengthen the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for the motherland. This is a task of great significance!

We would like to sincerely wish the "Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe" success in this trip, for the motherland and for the future of the spoken drama movement!

Long live the Chinese nation!

### Welcome the "Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe" to Hong Kong

Hong Kong Youth Drama Association

In a highly burning desire, the Chinese "National Salvation Drama Troupe" has finally arrived in Hong Kong.

The news that they were going abroad via Hong Kong had been spreading among us for a long time. We were so eager for the arrival of this team, but the long time increased our anxiety and desire, but it also increased our wishes, and this wish has a sense of lofty admiration!

Now, they have appeared before us in a late posture.

After the war of resistance, the Shanghai Wartime Drama Circle National Salvation Association Mobile Performing Troupe, which gloriously wrote a page in the history of Chinese drama, is well known to everyone. It has successively organized fifteen teams to set off from Shanghai and scatter to the east, west, north, and south battlefields and rear areas, traveling through rural areas, factories, barracks, hospitals, trenches, and other corners, giving full play to the highly effective suddenness in the most inflammatory and active form.

The team with the bright name of "Shanghai National Salvation Performing Troupe Second Team" is even more deeply imprinted in our minds. After the August 13th Incident, they traveled from Shanghai to Nanjing, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Hankou. and Macheng and other places, and then traced along the Yuehan Railway southward to Hunan and Guangxi, working in perseverance and hardship. Now, in the name of "Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe", they have been sincerely invited by the Guangxi Provincial Government to go overseas to promote the war of resistance and appeal for the soldiers on the front lines.

This spirit of struggle, the performance of a warrior in the national revolutionary war, is worthy of our learning and imitation in all aspects; these workers who are hard-working, persevering, and have the excellent qualities of the Chinese nation will undoubtedly be models for us to serve in the war of resistance in the future. As drama workers on the same front, especially those of us in Hong Kong who are in a state of demoralization and have lost our motherland, we will pay deep respect.

In colonial Hong Kong, ×× often looks forward to the motherland where the flames of war are everywhere, which makes us feel ashamed and also makes us feel that the responsibility is not far away. Therefore, we have also worked and struggled with a strong attitude, and have been pioneers and combatants in the Hong Kong cultural national salvation movement in our posts.

However, it is undeniable that our fighting strength is too weak; it is obvious that the performance of our work cannot keep up with the current stage of the war of resistance in the motherland, nor can it keep up with the workers who are fighting in the wilderness of the motherland.

Here, we should be ashamed and timid. We should learn, and we should fight more strongly for the motherland, for freedom and warmth!

Therefore, the National Salvation Drama Troupe, which has the heroic posture of "Xia Boyang" in the flames of the drama world, should be our best learner and model at this time!

Likewise, we earnestly ask our partners in the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe to give us who are working in Hong Kong with correct guidance and lessons of experience in the attitude of pioneers during this trip to Hong Kong. Only in this way, in the same position, can we join hands closely and strongly exude the power of drama struggle in the motherland's war of resistance!

Finally, we joyfully and deeply express our wishes, hoping that this trip abroad will bring the hardships of the motherland, the heroism of the soldiers, the misery of the compatriots, and the ××× to overseas, declare it to the overseas Chinese, and firmly tell them: the motherland is moving forward in victory! Victory is waving to us!

Hereby, the Hong Kong Youth Drama Association extends its warm welcome and high respect to these heroic partners!

April 1, 28th year of the Republic of China, Hong Kong.

### Drama Work in the War Zone

— Jinshan

After the outbreak of the "August 13th" Shanghai battle, I followed the team to work in the mainland, passing through the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, and Jiangxi, lasting nineteen months, and contacting countless farmers, soldiers, and political youth. I gradually felt that my life had increased some brilliance and strength; sometimes I was so excited that I shed tears, because I saw our bright future.

Young students and children of wealthy families all abandoned their schools and families and ran to poor and remote places. They all planned to organize many drama propaganda teams. They had never been to drama schools, nor had they studied performing arts. However, their work showed that they were all excellent folk artists. They have the ability to motivate the masses and organize the masses, and their dramas are also the most joyful and touching dramas for the people; why? Because they have two basic conditions: First, they have a wealth of political understanding, and they are constantly studying the situation of the war of resistance and international issues, so their assessment of the future of the war of resistance is very accurate and optimistic. From their words and actions, they told the people that "the war of resistance will surely be victorious"! Second, they have a commendable enthusiasm. On the stage, they use sincerity to excite the audience and enlighten the audience. I often say to my colleagues: We don't need stage zombies, we need a fresh soul to jump in front of the audience. What we do and say is living reality. We want to gain the audience's resonance. This "resonance" cannot be said to be "acting", but we believe that this does not violate Stanislavsky's drama principle of "spiritual realism".

We need to learn, constantly learn, and constantly learn in real life. In the past nineteen months, in the places I have passed through, I have seen many novel characters. In our experience, we have seen through the shape and heart of each character, which is of great help to our drama.

Here I would like to briefly talk about the lives of the young people who are working hard in the war zone: Generally speaking, there are organizations such as battlefield service teams or national salvation drama teams in various war zones. Their lives are no different from those of soldiers and farmers; in the border areas of Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, they are all scattered in various red spear societies. If they do not talk to you directly (or discuss a problem), you will not believe that they are intellectuals. In the past, some farmers in Gushi and other places organized their own drama troupes. When they performed dramas, there were hundreds of people in the crowd. They jumped, they roared, and they had inexhaustible vitality. There were also progressive drama youths leading them. We lived with the farmers in Dabie Mountain for more than two months. The farmers told us about their sufferings and expectations, and they were happy to listen to our opinions, which were all after watching our dramas and being moved.

In the war zone, young people are ashamed of not being able to live with the masses. From morning to night, they are trying to do today's work well. Work controls their nerves, and they are stimulated and excited all day long. There is no sorrow or disappointment.

I have an inaccurate statistic, that is, the number of farmers who were motivated by political workers, especially the influence of drama, and automatically participated in the war of resistance, is more than 20 million, which is an amazing record, and I believe that this record will continue to expand in coordination with the new situation of the war of resistance.

When performing dramas in Dabie Mountain, the farmers carried rice bags to watch the dramas. After watching the dramas, they cooked rice and ate, and then slept in the jungle or on the grass, preparing to watch again tomorrow. (At that time, the busy farming season had passed)

And the actors? They also slept with them, talking and laughing. This scene is still imprinted in my mind.

Leaving the motherland, I can't help but miss my colleagues. In China's emerging drama movement, they have indelible achievements. I miss those pure and kind farmers even more; they are still fighting the enemy desperately: I wish them good health!

Hong Kong has given me a very good impression. Although it is "singing and dancing to promote peace", on the other hand, many friends are trying to turn a group of backward young people to a more progressive path. They have organized drama societies, hoping to divert the interests of these people. This is also a very difficult task. I hope that they can have the same spirit as their friends in the war zone and cooperate well with the drama movement in the war zone.

I am very happy to see many lovely friends here. I hope to shake hands tightly with these friends!

6.  Rhythm and Tempo

Everything that exists has rhythm – the ever-changing sunset and the iceberg that moves only two inches in two centuries both possess rhythm. Rhythm is an infinite, eternal cadence; all created things depend on rhythm to exist – to transform the finite into the infinite. R. Boloslavsky said: "Rhythm is the ordered, measured change of all the different elements contained in a work of art, and all these changes gradually arouse the viewer's attention, continuously guiding them to the artist's final purpose."

Dramatic art originated from the dances of primitive humans, and dance is the most rhythmic of the temporal arts. The performances of today's actors are evolved from these primitive dances, and therefore, the actor's performance also possesses rhythm.

The entire dramatic performance has its own definite "tempo" – which can also be considered a type of rhythm. Each actor's performance should also have its own specific "tempo." Although this "tempo" is completed during the performance, it must be decided and arranged well in advance.

Sometimes, we see actors on stage who seem to be reciting a book. All their actions are dull and uninteresting, unable to arouse the audience's interest. This is because the actor's performance lacks rhythm.

Drama is not a book. Within a play, the actor must possess a power sufficient to maintain the audience's mood, forcing them to patiently watch your performance from beginning to end without flagging, "gradually arousing the viewer's attention, continuously guiding them to the artist's final purpose." The completion of this power depends on the rhythm of the performance.

The so-called rhythm is nothing more than the three principles of "fast," "moderate," and "slow," just like the tones in music, or in common parlance, "ups and downs." Only in this way can changes occur, and it is through constant changes that the audience's curiosity can be maintained, attracting their attention and making them forget the boredom of sitting in the theater.

"No struggle, no drama," is a famous saying that explains the principle of drama, and it can also be used to explain the principle of acting. Struggle unfolds conflict, and within conflict, crises and climaxes naturally arise. Small crises accumulate into large crises, and small climaxes develop into the highest climax, forming the dramatic peak. The progress of drama is curvilinear, wave-shaped. The actor's performance must also grasp this point. When an actor receives the script, studies and understands the character they are playing, they can begin planning the performance of that character, finding the location of the highest peak and concentrating their energy on that place, doing their best to express it. In addition, find the peaks in each act, each entrance, each section, and even each action. What must be noted is that there must be a preparation for each peak before the peak, so that it is coherent and does not feel sudden. All the peaks are prepared for the "highest peak." The expressive power of the "highest peak" must be more outstanding than the secondary peaks and other peaks; otherwise, your performance is still a failure, because the rhythm is already disordered.

Of course, rhythm does not only refer to the rhythm of intonation in dialogue. It should also include movement. The actor performs through the combination of dialogue and movement, going back and forth. The rhythm of speech and the rhythm of movement are just like the difference between dialogue and movement, which must have an organic connection. They must harmonize with each other without conflict, heading towards the same goal and exerting a unified effect.

The rhythm of an actor's performance can be divided into two aspects: "conscious rhythm" and "mutual rhythm." Regarding "conscious rhythm," R. Boloslavsky said: "First is walking, second is speech, and third is emotion. Every step, every word, every emotion is a constant change, and each aspect has the same destination, the same final goal." When these can be practiced to the point where they can be freely manipulated by oneself, when external forces reflect their rhythm back, then a new rhythm is developed. The creation of this new rhythm is no longer individual, but communal. At this time, it is a chorus, not a solo. Therefore, your tone and key must be unified with the other person, that is, so-called unified breathing. There must be understanding and mutual restraint between each interaction, producing a "mutual rhythm" and creating a unified atmosphere.

The creation of rhythm in performance must be carefully planned and arranged by the actor themselves. Therefore, it can be used as a standard to judge the diligence and competence of a particular actor, and it can also be used as the best tool for an actor to capture the audience's attention.

### Sing Hwa Team Suffers Defeat in First Trial of New Tactics, Ultimately South China Is Better, Sing Hwa's Short Passing Technique Is Very Good but Its Improper Use Is in Vain

Xie Qingfu Decides to Play in Today's Match Against Hong Kong Selection

(Special report from this newspaper) The Sing Hwa "veterans" who returned from Nanyang staged their "premiere" here yesterday. Men and women alike climbed Jia Mountain, with an estimated crowd of over ten thousand. The lively scene of the Hong Kong-Philippines interport match was seen again yesterday. People say the football scene is thriving, and I agree, but I must add the phrase, "Wealthy amongst the 'upper-class refugees'."

Some of the football fans who witnessed the battle yesterday expressed disappointment with the performance of the Sing Hwa players, because Sing Hwa lost to South China's fierce attack with a score of zero to three. On the surface, it seems that their football skills are not very high, but disappointment aside, Sing Hwa is indeed a strong team, but the failure has many other reasons.

As far as I know, Singaporean footballers are known for their short passing technique. Yesterday's events told us that what we saw was indeed what we knew. The strategy adopted by Sing Hwa was indeed too much short passing. It was common to see an inside midfielder receive the ball, and unless it was quite urgent, they would not immediately kick the ball out, always seeking a fleeting opportunity to keep the ball at their feet, then dribble and pass it to the forward who was standing closest to them. Sometimes, even the midfielders would pass to each other. This kind of circuitous offensive strategy is quite effective in dispersing the defensive formation of the opposing defenders, but it can only be used in the middle of the field and never everywhere. The Sing Hwa players focused solely on short passes, which was unnecessarily time-consuming and resulted in mistakes, so progress depended on accurate passing to penetrate. But it's not certain that penetrating deeply means opportunity. If intercepted, the previous efforts are wasted. The forwards have to work very hard and it's not easy to find a way out, but even finding a way out doesn't guarantee a shot on goal. If it is cleared by a South China defender with one kick, all the efforts are in vain. Therefore, although Sing Hwa's short passes are wonderful and beautiful, and their running is quick, the circuitous attack is not as effective as a direct, near-attack that acts according to the situation. Even if it is effective, the forwards are not good at shooting. Several balls that could have won were lost due to the final shot on goal. I think that if the Sing Hwa forwards had the same support from the midfielders as South China, and did not rely on "solely short passes", then the attack would be much sharper. Hopefully, they can find a way to improve this today.

Xie Qingfu, the "new Li Huitang" admired by fans, put on his full uniform, but was not seen on the front line. It is said that he suffered a minor foot injury while fighting in the Philippines. After resting for another day, he decided to play in today's match against the Hong Kong Selection. Also, regulars Deng Yuehan, Wen Guanzong, and Xia Zhixiang are also watching from the sidelines like Qingfu. Therefore, Sing Hwa's combat power is slightly affected. If they appeared with the original lineup, even if they still couldn't beat South China, they would at least have one or two goals in return. This is not to cover up after Sing Hwa's defeat. In fact, Sing Hwa had several sure-win opportunities, but unfortunately, they didn't have forwards who were good at shooting, so they missed them. If Fu Qing was on the front line, then other good opportunities go without saying. A single penalty kick would be guaranteed to be scored.

After seeing the heading skills of the Sing Hwa players, everyone praised them. In the South China lineup, only Liang Rongzhao can compare. It's a pity that they are good at short passing, good at heading, and run as fast as rabbits, but when fighting, they stick to the rules and don't know how to change, so they can't adapt to the situation. The defenders, threatened by Li Huitang's "name", focus on his personal actions, so they often adopt a concentrated interception method, focusing on Li Huitang and neglecting others, which gives the South China team gaps to attack from the flanks. Deng Guangsen and Yang Shuiyi often received supplies from the inside forwards, were exceptionally active, and frequently launched attacks, eventually scoring three goals.

South China is also known for short passes, belonging to the same school of thought as Sing Hwa, but the South China players know how to change and act according to the situation. It must be understood that ball games are like warfare. There must be substance, but also use. With use, there must be substance. Only when substance and use are combined can one succeed. The South China players have been through many battles and know the key to substance and use, so they achieve twice the result with half the effort.

Since Zhang Rongcai "came out of the mountains", Bao Jiaping has another disciple. Therefore, he has rarely appeared on the field recently. In this great battle, the South China authorities did not choose others, but showed "favor" to Jiaping, which is a profound intention to use talent. The reason is that Jiaping traveled south many times before and gained experience. The "old horse knows the way" and sees the "ball path" of the Singaporean players clearly. Sure enough, his performance yesterday was exquisite, truly a master craftsman.

In my opinion, the most outstanding performance of the Sing Hwa players was Zhu Chenggui. He was full of energy, and the ball arrived when he did. His heading was especially certain. Although he was unable to completely control Huitang yesterday, he didn't lose a single high ball. However, the strategy he adopted was not the third inside defender defense method, but a concentrated defense combined with a triangular passing attack method. Using this method to deal with South China is ineffective.

The two inside midfielders, Chen Kaiwan, were better than Sun Chunlai, but they still couldn't kick the ball far. Also, the positions of the two were often inappropriate. Goalkeeper Li Botang has wonderful skills, such as pouncing and catching, with no flaws. Midfielder Xu Houkun's position was slightly forward than Ji Youling, but he suddenly dribbled the ball out to attack and suddenly retreated to defend, running too much, eventually leading to chaos.

The center forward, Long Liwu, didn't fully demonstrate his leadership skills, but he was very lively. Wei Ci's style was also fierce. It can be seen how capable winger Li Haizhu is as he often earns a pass from Li Tiansheng. Cai Yuehan also had good moments, while He Guocai didn't do much well. In short, the forwards' progress was extremely fast, but it's a pity they didn't bring their "shooting shoes."

The performance of the South China players was generally good. Their superior skills are extraordinary. Huitang's first goal can be called divine. Jiaping's repeated rescue of the situation can be called a miraculous recovery. Rongzhao's imposing manner was overwhelming, and Tiansheng's power rejected the invading army. Feng Jingxiang was meticulous and subtly gained victory. Li Zhaorong assisted with merit and cooperated consistently. All these are commendable. Guangsen was quick and decisive, using all his "tricks," while Shuiyi was "disordered and uncontrolled," cutting the ball inaccurately. (Football Field Ogre)

Last Night's Basketball Game: South China Defeats South China, Grade B Police Also Defeats Zhong Sheng by One Point, Chunfeng Wins Lingying with 55 to 37

In yesterday evening's first public men's basketball game, the Grade B Police team faced Zhong Sheng. In the first half, Zhong Sheng took the lead by several points. When the Police team tried their best to counterattack, they tied the score twice. At the end of the game, the two sides were still tied at thirty to thirty. In the overtime, the Police team finally won by a narrow margin of forty-one to forty. In the second game, the Grade A South China team faced South China. The two teams were evenly matched and fought desperately. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented since the start of this tournament. In the fifteen minutes before the end of the game, the two sides tied several times. The atmosphere in the stadium was tense for a while. Until the last minute, South China relied on Huang Zuode's sudden special skill from the sidelines, and the ball went into the basket, finally securing the victory with a score of fifty to forty-eight.

South China's victory should be attributed to the three pillars of Yi Zuode, Zhong Ling, and Chen Zanyin, but they were not outstanding in the first half, especially their shooting accuracy was lacking. There were flaws in the team's communication. Because South China sometimes adopted a zone defense and sometimes a man-to-man defense, the South China forwards could not penetrate deeply, so they were forced to shoot from a distance, but only one in ten shots went in, so they lost the first half with a score of nineteen to twenty-three.

In the first half, because South China's strength was not sustained, on one hand, and because Huang Zhong and Chen's ball skills gradually became normal, South China turned favorable. Seeing that dribbling the ball was time-consuming and not worthwhile, they changed to counter-jumping passes, avoiding many interceptions by the opponent. The positions taken by Huang Zuode, Zhong Ling, and Chen Zanyin were extremely flexible. Each pass and catch showed their skill, and the shooting accuracy was also reported to be accurate. Zhong Ling was forced to leave the field with four fouls, and South China took the opportunity to pursue closely, but South China's remaining power was not quelled, and they finally won.

South China's defeat was purely due to a lack of sustained strength. All the team members can be said to have done their duty. Lu Enjing's defense was effective and his contribution cannot be overstated. He won every rebound. As for Jie Min, Chen Xinqiu, Shi Zhizhi, etc., they were especially brilliant in the first half, but their performance gradually declined in the second half, and the line of defense was messy. South China took the opportunity to penetrate deep into their territory, so they lost after winning, and were eventually suppressed by South China.

In the early stages of the game, the situation was calm. When South China's Huang Zuode scored a free throw and opened the scoring, both sides scored afterwards, making it eight to seven. When it was thirteen to thirteen, the situation gradually became tense. When South China's Chen Xinqiu and Shi Zhida scored baskets one after another, they took the lead with a score of twenty-one to thirteen and twenty-five to seventeen. Until the end of the half, South China lost with a score of nineteen to twenty-five.

Changing ends and fighting again, Huang Zuode and Chen Zanyuan suddenly revealed their sharp edges and continued to catch up, creating a tie of thirty-one to thirty. Afterwards, South China sailed smoothly, repeatedly scoring from the side or pushing the ball in under the basket in graceful poses, again achieving a score of forty-one to thirty-six. When Zhong Ling was four-fouled and left the field, South China's defense became even more eventful. The two sides again tied at forty-three to forty-three. Afterwards, South China still took the lead by one or two points all the way until the end of the game, finally winning with a score of fifty to forty-eight.

In the last game, the Grade B Chunfeng team faced Lingying. The two teams were originally strong teams in Grade B, but Lingying was not outstanding last night and was defeated by Chunfeng with a score of thirty-seven to fifty-five.

First Half

(Four minutes) South China advances and attacks, encircling the Sing Hwa defense, but Chenggui and others' separate attacks are ineffective. Huitang shoots, but it goes over the crossbar.

(Eight minutes) Sing Hwa is still ravaged by South China, busy parrying. Guangsen dribbles on the border, Zhaorong responds on the right, a quick pass, and Tang shoots into the net from the crowd with lightning speed, making the score 1 to 0. Spectators call it a wonderful skill.

(Twelve minutes) Liwu once led the team to counterattack, jumping high and shooting, with considerable momentum, but it fell out of bounds. In the blink of an eye, Haizhu cleverly passed through many barriers and crossed the ball, which swept past the goal, and Yuehan was half a step late, missing a good opportunity.

(Fifteen minutes) Shuiyi gets a pass from Jingxiang, enters the left road and fires a cold shot, almost hitting the bullseye. Then, South China returns with a vengeance, Zhaorong turns and shoots in the smoky dust, but Baiye catches it with both hands and kicks the ball out of danger.

(Nineteen minutes) Zhaohan kicks the ball in the defense, his footwork is not good, and the "bullet" falls in front of the city. Jiaping sees the forward charging and punches the ball out. Liwu is too late, and the ball is obtained by Zhan Shi, who quickly passes it to Guocai. Guocai grits his teeth and shoots fiercely, missing the goal by an inch. The South China players breathe a sigh of relief.

(Thirty-two minutes) Sing Hwa is besieged, struggling desperately to break through, taking advantage of the gap and attacking. Shaohan is eager to save the ball, mistakenly supporting Guocai with his back when Guocai jumps high to head the ball, causing Guocai to fall to the ground and be penalized with a penalty kick. Chenggui shoots the ball into the net before the referee blows the whistle, which is invalid. He is ordered to shoot again. Sing Hwa then appoints Yuehan to take the penalty, but his footwork is inaccurate, and the ball hits Jiaping's body, losing a sure-win opportunity.

Second Half

(Five minutes) South China leads by one to zero, feeling secure, and attacks as a defense. The Sing Hwa players want to recover the lost ground and perform better than before, attacking several times, but without success.

(Seven minutes) Haizhu passes a wonderful ball, and Liwu and Ren Shi double-charge. Jiaping punches the ball out again, resulting in a corner kick, wonderful!

(Eighteen minutes) Yuehan and Guocai switch positions, getting a pass from Chenggui and advancing along the border. When the opportunity arises, Liwu is half a step late, missing the opportunity to break through.

(Twenty-three minutes) South China continues to attack, shooting continuously. When Guowei throws a high ball, Jingxiang gets a chance to kick, and "A Dou" rotates into the net from the corner of the goal, beautifully clear, (two to zero) the victory is secured.

(Thirty-three minutes) Tired birds know to return, and spectators leave their seats one after another, the sound of fish swimming in the water [unclear] Xiang passes the ball [unclear] the ball falls in front of Lusen, who shoots from there, hitting the bullseye again, making the score three to zero. South China triumphs.

### Today's Match Against Hong Kong Selection

At 4:00 p.m. today, Sing Hwa will play for the second time, facing the Hong Kong Interport team from the Philippines. The venue is still Jia Mountain. The Hong Kong team's lineup is impeccable, especially the forwards are complete. Gao Shanlu is also listed, recalling that in the Hong Kong-Philippines interport match, Gao took the lead, attacking and defending and transporting supplies, and was even more outstanding. Spectators applauded, saying that this gentleman has returned to his former bravery. In the recent important football finals, such as the Governor's Cup and the Lihua Cup, Gao did not appear. Whether he can show his skills today will only be known at the time. Huitang, not tired after yesterday's fierce battle, will take command again, leading the heroic army to battle.

However, Hou Chengtou's foot injury has not healed, so he may not play and will be replaced by Yi Shilan Zhi. Also, it was discovered yesterday that someone was secretly selling fake tickets. Please pay attention, spectators.

### On School Sports in Hong Kong (3)

— Zhuoyue

(5) On Group Activities

Students in general schools are trapped in schools as small as birdcages. From morning to night, they are subjected to knowledge indoctrination. In fact, every student's mind is extremely fatigued. If there are no other activities to regulate them, they may become as docile as pigs, unable to raise any activities or even mention them. The only way to solve this problem is to promote group activities. The Ministry of Education has issued orders to all education departments to forward them to all schools for compliance. Every Saturday afternoon, there are two to three hours of extracurricular activities. All faculty and students are mobilized – suburban trips, mountain climbing, or suburban gatherings, etc. Such activities can regulate the lives of students and teachers, cultivate the habit of group living, and foster the spirit of hard work and endurance, and train a strong physique to achieve the goal of popularizing sports. It is hoped that schools should hold them once or several times every week or month. Moreover, under such activities, teachers can also gain a lot of insights about students. Things that cannot be seen in school can also be seen at this time, so that deeper guidance can be given.

(6) Past Athlete Sports

The reason why Chinese sports have not been popularized for thousands of years and have fallen behind is mostly because the purpose of sports was misunderstood in the past, resulting in the failure to obtain the true effect of sports training. Only a group of nondescript glory-seeking athletes lacking cultivation were produced. Therefore, the failure of sports in the past lies in this point, and they do not know that athletes are a special product of popular sports. This is because most people are too farsighted and cannot see the foundation of athletes (popular sports training).

School sports in Hong Kong still suffer from this problem, only paying attention to the training of school athletes, using them to show off, and treating them like stores selling advertisements. I think it is especially shameful that some sports instructors want to use athletes to show off and "buy athletes" to participate in various glory-seeking competitions regardless of personality. I hope with all my heart that comrades who are responsible for sports education should be able to break the concept of athlete sports in the past. Future athletes should be produced from popular sports – only when sports training can be popularized can we talk about athlete training. Athlete training must be based on character (sportsmanship).

(7) Precious School Sports Associations

What I call a precious school sports association does not have any other side effects. Regardless of whether it is organized now or in the future, or who initiates it, if it can be truly organized for the improvement and development of school sports, and is rich in service spirit and the ability to keep up with the times, it can be said to be a "precious" sports association. Conversely, if it is "selling dog meat under the pretense of selling mutton", only organized for one's own glory-seeking (self-interest), and does not benefit school sports, it cannot be considered a precious school sports association. It can only be said to be a glory-seeking association. So my last shout is still hoping that schools in Hong Kong can have a true sports association that serves school sports.

In summary, school sports in general in Hong Kong are still lagging behind. If we want to develop them to achieve the goal of educating the country through sports and meet the needs of extraordinary times, we must focus on popularizing sports, eliminate all athlete sports, improve the methods of athlete training, break the bad habit of buying athletes, improve the level and status of sportsmanship, respect the academic qualifications, experience, and personality of sports instructors, and have an organized school sports association with a service spirit and ability to lead the schools. They should also make use of various environments to promote lively calisthenics and group activities.

### Eastern Team to Expedition to Vietnam: Departing at 4 PM Today on the Qingyuan

The Eastern Athletic Association football team has had remarkable results this season, especially the undefeated streak in the second round of the league, which is precious. At the invitation of the Vietnamese Football Association, they are scheduled to depart at 4:00 PM today on the Qingyuan for about three to six games in Vietnam. The team includes seventeen members, including the leader and captain Chen Fuyu, coach Shi Li Hua, and fifteen players: Liu Xianhan, Miao Huaguo, Zeng Zhongyun, Xu Buyun, Luo Weiquan, Xu Jingcheng, Wu Qixiang, Li Haiqing, Cao Qiuting, Yu Qiaxing, Li Deqi, Xu, Kui, Chen Bingt, Xu Heng, and Song Lingsheng who is unwell, will not be traveling. The tentative itinerary is as follows: against the Haiphong United Team in Haiphong (6th), against the Runner-up Team in Henan (9th), against the Champion Team in Henan (12th), and three games in Saigon, with dates to be determined. For this expedition, various sectors have donated goods, including two dozen bottles of Yong An Tang Wan Jin Oil, one dozen bottles of headache powder, one dozen bottles of Bagua Dan, sixty pairs of shorts and two jackets from the China Emporium, and two footballs from Wing On Company. If they do not go to Saigon, they will return to Hong Kong within two weeks; otherwise, it will take more than three weeks. It is reported that the General Association (Hole) hopes that the association will return to Hong Kong before the 25th or 26th of this month to prepare for the championship against the Navy.

### Lesson of Blood

— Lin Fu

Our heroic resistance against Japan has lasted twenty-one months. During this period, whether on the front lines or in the rear, soldiers and civilians have exerted great strength, using their blood to write the most glorious national epic. This will be forever remembered in the hearts of Chinese sons and daughters.

What does the lesson of blood teach us?

[1] Comparison of mortality rates.

At the outbreak of the war, the ratio of casualties in the Battle of Shanghai was five to one. Six months later, at the Battle of Xuzhou, it changed to two to one. Another six months later, during the Battle of Wuhan, there was another change, becoming one to one. In the most recent phase of the war, we have adopted new tactics, and this comparison has undergone even more astonishing changes. One Chinese soldier can now take down five Japanese soldiers; however, the situation in the Second War Zone is even more different, with a ratio of one to fourteen and a half! From the comparison of these statistics, we can see that:

A. China's combat techniques have made significant progress during the war.

B. If we resolutely continue the resistance, the collapse of the Japanese is evident and will come soon.

[2] The power of the masses has grown in the war.

In the early stages of the war, the people had not actively participated in the resistance. For example, when we were fighting in the Chenjiahang-Jiading-Changshu area, the relationship between the military and civilians was not well established. However, soon after, when we twice participated in operations in Xiaoshan and Yidu, Zhejiang, the situation was different. All the work of delivering food, transporting ammunition, and supporting the wounded was undertaken by the people spontaneously. By the time we reached Dingyuan, Guo Yang, and Mengcheng in Anhui, the spirit of the people was even stronger. Many guerrilla teams, transportation teams, rescue teams, and reconnaissance teams were organized to cooperate with the army in combat. This is clearly more progressive. As the war zone expands, the power of the masses becomes easier to harness.

[3] Shattered the illusion of the Japanese.

The initial attempt of the Japanese was to win without fighting, but we fought without surrendering. The Japanese wanted a quick victory, but we insisted on protracted resistance. The Japanese then released peace feelers, but this could not shake our determination to resist. Now the Japanese are singing the song of a century-long war, but all the Chinese children who refuse to be slaves will expel the entire Japanese from our land. This war will never stop!

The protracted national war is not limited by time or space. We must follow the instructions of the supreme leader and strive for military supremacy and ultimate victory. This is the most urgent and fundamental task at present.

### Sent from Afar to Wuhan

— Hu Weizhou

On the way from Kowloon Tsim Sha Tsui Station to Tai Po, I unexpectedly saw vehicles marked "Canton-Hankou Railway," which reminded me of my dear friend Wuhan, with whom I had shared hardships three years ago.

At this moment, strands of old dreams climbed into my heart, like the overflowing Yangtze River, no longer able to suppress the yearning, bitterness, and myriad emotions of my three years of wandering in Wuhan! What is Wuhan like after our separation?

It was nine years ago, on a summer night when an electric fan blew hot air, that me and my friends were strolling along the Bund in the Japanese Concession, hoping to catch a breath of fresh air by the river. But "whack!"—a burning slap suddenly struck the face of a stranger next to us, followed by..."Piggy, get out!"

Unexpectedly, this "pig" character took on pig-like qualities and retaliated with a "whack!" of its own. As a result, the startled police screamed like ghosts. In the end, they couldn't catch the "piggy" but caught the three of us "suspects" who were "walking together."

But who can deny that we are "piggies"? A year later, I fell in love with a girl there. She loved to paint and often asked me to help her carry her equipment to Boya Terrace, Hongshan Park, or the edge of East Lake to paint the scenery she loved. I loved to read Goethe's poetry and would bring a collection with me to the mountains and spend half a day reading.

However, I also lingered at the crossroads of Jianghan Road and Zhongshan Road; I also listened to the distant whistles of the numerous yarn factories on the opposite bank in front of the Jianghan Customs House. I also remember the tears I shed in the autumn twilight when I parted with that girl in a state of hunger. But who sympathized with this separation?

After that—in the storm of December the year before last—I crawled out of the blockade of Shanghai, which had fallen, like a rat, crossed the three major railways, and accidentally set foot in Wuhan again. But in just a few hours, I still felt faint and suffocated, and my heart kept telling me that someone was whipping me, "I still need you here!" It was as if I was being forced to leave, counting the length of the Canton-Hankou Railway as I walked away. A bird's-eye view of Wuhan was imprinted in my mind again—a scene almost identical to the one before, with people still maintaining a facade of leisure.

Another year passed. Just when I was hating the inexplicable fall of Guangzhou, I heard the thunderous news of the destruction of Greater Wuhan, which made it impossible for me to shake off the image of the majestic posture of the three towns of Wuhan and the more than one million Hubei people whose accents I knew so well. Ah!

Wuhan, I offer you a sincere heart and entrust the south wind to send it to your spirit, as a distant condolence from your friend.

On the way back to Tai Po, I again encountered the "Canton-Hankou Railway" vehicle standing there, as if mourning and lamenting to me: Wuhan University on the towering Mount Luojia has been destroyed! The magnificent Yellow Crane Tower ××××××, the Hanyang Arsenal, the Daye Iron and Steel Plant, everything has been burned down! This is a calamity of the barbarians thousands of times worse than the flood eight years ago! But Wuhan, don't grieve. Those rude young friends of yours in those days are now gathering back together. At this moment, you are just like my fate five years ago when I was ravaged by the Japanese, but I have not died after all, and I am still working here vigorously. So we will eventually have a reunion day.

### Calloused Iron Palms

— He Chengjiang

Don't underestimate these calloused iron palms!

Only calloused iron palms

Have the strength of steel.

They can pick up a plow to till the fields,

Producing a lot of food!

They can pick up an ax to chop wood,

Building many houses!

They can pick up a wooden oar,

To row the boat across the stormy ocean...

Calloused iron palms, calloused iron palms!

Have clenched their guns in response to the call to resist Japan.

They have also not abandoned their

Plows, axes, wooden oars...

They pick up whatever they need to do at the time,

Who wants to deprive them of their freedom and lock them up?

They will kill whoever tries! Without mercy!

They want to produce, they want to build, they want to defend their homes!

Ah! How great! Calloused iron palms!

### Between Humans and Beasts

— Chunfeng

There is a saying in the Notes from the Submerged Chamber:

"Mr. Liangxi said that once one falls into the trap of wealth and lust, one becomes a beast."

The difference between humans and beasts does not seem far, just as the Western proverb says, the outside of paradise is hell. As for why falling into the trap of wealth and lust leads to becoming a beast, the reason is not given. There is another saying in the Records of Meifeng:

"Following reason leads to sages, indulging in desire leads to beasts."

This seems to explain a little why falling into the trap of wealth and lust leads to becoming a beast. Naturally, wealth and lust are desires. To satisfy "desire," one cares nothing for the individual, the nation, or the country. At the same time, one can disown ancestors and betray compatriots. Does this not make one a beast?

However, those who are obsessed with profit and desire will never admit to being beasts, just as they would argue: "We are loyal to saving the country, our attitude is upright..." At the same time, they say on the contrary: "So-and-so has never taken action in Hanoi!" The words sound pleasing, but what about the actions? Hasn't a certain proponent of peace recently moved from Hanoi to Siam? The relationship between Siam and Japan is known to the world. Bargaining with mysterious figures like Doihara in Siam will probably not encounter any more setbacks, not to mention that there is Tokyo beyond Siam. But even if they openly run to Tokyo! They will still deny the name of advocating peace. The mouth is such a wonderful and versatile thing. The ancient Jewish king Solomon once wrote a book called Proverbs, with a chapter saying:

"There are three things that I cannot fathom, and four that I do not know: the way of an eagle in the air, the way of a snake on a rock, the way of a ship in the sea, and the way of a man with a woman. The way of an adulteress is also like this: she eats and wipes her mouth, and says, 'I have done no wrong.'"

In fact, if Solomon, that great sage, knew today, he should add one more beastly way to the list of incomprehensible things. Their strong arguments can indeed be equated with the other four.

There is a passage in Issues 7 and 8 of Guoxun that is well worth reading, titled "A Record of a Conversation with Li Zongren," in which there is a discussion of those who advocate peace:

"Those who advocate peace are probably not sincere... There are two reasons why they have different intentions and make some fallacious arguments to deceive the world. The first reason is that they are mostly refined people who cannot withstand the horror of war. They become flustered when planes circle over their heads a few times... The second is that they are opportunists who always want to rely on something to stand out... The advocacy of peace is just a trick, and politics is at play in its essence."

This passage can be used to further explain the previous opinion that "indulging in desire leads to becoming a beast." Mr. Li Zongren is a military man, but his insights are more penetrating than those of scholars.

### Review of "Wartime Japan" Issue 6 (Continued)

— Wen Yu

Japan denies that it intends to close the door to China or exclude the interests of third parties in order to deceive and lie to countries with interests in China. In fact, Japan has been carrying out extremely rapid economic aggression in our occupied territories. Here, Mr. Dong Min's article, "Economic Aggression under Japan's 'Localism,'" is the most informative. From this, we know that Japan has seized the various sectors of industry among its spoils, classifying and planning for many new plunder plans. The evidence of this "economic aggression" proves Japan's true purpose in invading China and exposes all of Japan's deception and lies, which can correct erroneous international views.

Mr. Song Feiru's serialized "On the Essence of the Japanese Empire" is a work explaining the essence of the Japanese Empire. This issue's section, "Cultivation Forms after the Meiji Restoration," helps to fully point out Japan's semi-feudal nature based on the "Land Ownership Relationship" described in the previous issue. Using abundant materials, it points out the semi-feudal nature of the land economy after the capitalist revolution. It first explains the characteristics of cultivated land ownership, and then points out that in terms of land rent, rent in kind is still a common form, and corvée rent has not yet been eliminated. Money rent, which is the basic form of land rent in capitalist society, is extremely uncommon in Japan. However, in terms of "public rent," due to coercion, it "sheds the form of rent in kind and transforms into the form of money rent." This is a "military stipulation," by which "one can grasp the military nature and semi-serf nature of Japanese capitalism." This serialized work is the greatest achievement in studying Japanese socioeconomics.

Regarding Japan's invasion of Hainan Island, there are two commentaries by Mr. Chunzhen and Mr. Feiru, pointing out its impact on our resistance and the international community. Related to this issue is Mr. Xu Zhuoying's article, "The 'Philippines' under the Threat of Japan's Southern Advance."

Regarding "Sketches of Japanese Women," the main focus of the issue, there are three articles: Mr. Chen Xunzhi's "A Female Political Prisoner," Mr. Jian Mo's "Kyoko Marries a Legless Wounded Soldier," and a Tokyo dispatch, "The Wartime Colors of Japanese Women." Mr. Yi San's short commentary, "Japan's Pink Policy," points out the inhumanity of the Japanese military's coercion of women.

Continuing and unfinished works include articles by Mr. Si Mu and Mr. Lin Huanping. The former describes the dangerous fate of wartime Japanese laborers and their resistance to the Japanese warlike government, while the latter narrates the growth of the Japanese Communist Party and its activities during the war.

### The Snow of Manchuria

— Shu Qun

"Do you want me to force you to leave?"

"Whatever."

So, he pressed the gun against her back, forcing her to move forward. But she conveniently hugged the electric welder next to her, turned her head, and looked at him indifferently,(Hole)ing him. She knew that he could be indulged now, at least within the limits of not endangering his safety, and she would always be safe. He was furious, raised the gun, aimed it at her head, and threatened:

"I'm going to shoot!"

"I didn't hold your hand either, shoot!"

"Okay, close your eyes!"

"I'm not afraid! I want to see your skills!"

"What?"

"I'm not leaving, kill me!"

Her persistence in this determination finally made the gun he once relied on to solve all problems lose its dignity and authority.

Night came. The night sky could not hide the color of the snow. The road, the rooftops, the tops of the walls were still white. Wherever there was snow, it was white; even the thread of snow left on the branches was white. The nights of Manchuria in winter can be said to be mysteriously white.

If there were painters to paint this night scene in Manchuria, they would have to bring a lot of white paint, otherwise they would feel a lack in the complete set of paints, or almost everything besides white would be superfluous. Red is also essential now, let the painters bring more of it; because now the snow in Manchuria is often red - the blood of the people of Manchuria, the fate of the people of Manchuria, needs the painter's red expression!

If there are singers from Manchuria, let them sing a song about snow. This song will tell people about the beauty of the scenery and the beautiful and alluring snow; the memory of snow, the dream of snow, can also make people's souls (Hole) wander (Hole) - the memory of snow is bitter, but unforgettable. This song will tell people many stories of snow, the characters in the stories; he and she are also among them.
