### The Great Significance of the International "China Week"

Since we launched our sacred War of Resistance, the greatest sympathy and most active assistance has been shown to us by the people of various countries. They are the most able to deeply recognize the momentous significance of China's War of Resistance in human history, so their support is the most sincere and their assistance is the most active. We have been fighting for the upholding of true peace and human justice for two full years, so our international friends, who sympathize with us the most and assist us the most actively, have again launched a "China Week" to commemorate the "July 7th" Incident. American groups in New York held a "China Week," and Chinese and American residents in Washington will also hold a "July 7th" parade, and it is heard that Democratic Senator Thomas and leaders of organizations such as the American Federation of Labor will also participate. Other places, such as Chicago and New York, Boston, will also hold Mass. The British China Aid Committee also recently launched a "China Week" to mobilize British public opinion to jointly assist China, and specially published a daily newspaper, named "China News," whose role is particularly important. The significance of Britain's commemoration of China's War of Resistance is particularly significant.

Today, the sympathy and role of public opinion of the people of various countries are particularly worthy of our attention. We know that the × people's war of aggression against China has been quite exhausted. We faintly hear that after their internal recent disputes and quarrels, they have reached a general conclusion, unanimously hoping to end the war in the autumn of this year to save their own peril, and wanting to replace military action with diplomatic means. At this time, what Japan most hopes for is for Britain to come forward to mediate; the Tianjin incident is a concentrated expression of this. Britain has even made concessions to Japan to some extent. This point has indeed received great criticism from the British people, but judging from the current situation, the actions of the British government authorities still need more enthusiastic supervision. Yesterday's "China News" published an editorial by the famous novelist Beverly Nichols, which stated: "We must find a way to prevent British policy from benefiting tyrannical aggressors; on the contrary, we should make it assist steadfast and persevering resisters." This is such a great warning and admonition!

On the British side, the "China Campaign Committee" is the most developed, with London as its headquarters, and branches in places such as Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester, and Liverpool. The China Campaign Committee is the most active group in aiding China. We believe that they will be able to more actively supervise the future movements of the British government's Far East policy. London will hold a mass rally on "July 7th," which will certainly have a positive expression in correcting British policy, which we can predict.

Britain is a democratic country, and the government's political and diplomatic policies are subject to the supervision and guidance of the people. This kind of power is expressed in the questions in the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and in the people's public opinion and actions. The British government has always been subject to this kind of powerful supervision. At present, Britain has three major events to resolve carefully: one is how to deal with Japan in the Far East, the second is how to deal with Germany and Italy in Europe, and the third is how to quickly complete the Anglo-Soviet-French alliance agreement. And these three are closely related, and are all about the work of concluding an anti-aggression front. Whether Britain can correctly handle these issues has a great relationship to the world's justice and peace. Therefore, the responsibility borne by the British people at this time is particularly great. We hope that the British people can use this memorial day to commemorate the heroic resistance against aggressors, and have more concrete and effective expressions in speech and action!

### On Guerrilla Warfare in the Plains

— Zhou Shiti

(4) A general prohibition on the use of envelopes and stationery printed with battalion numbers. Envelopes and stationery printed with battalion numbers are only to be used for important formal official documents to friendly forces or government agencies, but the less the better.

(5) When marching, flags should be rolled up and road signs should use markings. The rear guard should have specialized personnel to collect road signs and eliminate traces left by the march. When necessary, fake road signs can be deliberately set up to deceive the enemy. During daytime marches, attention should be paid to camouflage; during nighttime marches, smoking and lighting fires, loud talking, and other noises are prohibited!

(6) Headquarters must use code names. During marches, slogans should be placed in open spaces and shaded from the air as much as possible to prevent × air raids and reconnaissance.

(8) When camping in areas close to × areas, news must be carefully blocked. Plainclothes reconnaissance personnel should be sent to the campsite in advance. The masses are prohibited from going to the × side, and the警戒部队 must prohibit the masses from leaving the警戒线, but they must explain it well to the masses. If it is necessary to go out, and the situation permits, personnel from the troops must be sent to take them or give them passes, but the passes should not write battalion numbers on them.

(9) When leaders reconnoiter terrain, they should not bring too many personnel and must be concealed. It is best to all wear plain clothes and avoid riding horses as much as possible (if riding horses, they should be left further behind.)

(19) When ambushing, blocking the news is even more important. It must be done so that not a single member of the masses leaks the news. Even the masses passing through the ambush site must be explained to well upon their return. According to the materials on the × people's "suppression" operations against our Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, "One example of judging whether there are × in a village: first, when there are no × people in the village, the people's children play in front of the door, and there are villagers in the fields; second, when × people are near the village, there is no one in the fields, the doors are bolted shut, and men look around on the roofs; third, when × people are in the village, no human figures can be found, and during the autumn harvest season, the reaping is also stopped." Therefore, if there are no people or activity when sealing off the ambush site, then the × people can immediately judge that our army is ambushing, so we must send out disguised personnel to work in the fields and move around in the villages. These disguised personnel can also participate in the war during wartime, which is also beneficial.

Mass Work

Establishing guerrilla bases in the plains mainly relies on mass conditions. There are many masses in the plains, but this is only one aspect of the conditions. The main thing is to rely on us to mobilize, organize, and lead them to engage in arduous struggles with the × people, in order to demonstrate the great and unconquerable power of the masses. This is how the so-called reliance on mass conditions is completed.

Troops operating in the plains should pay attention to the following central issues in mass work:

(1) There must be a high degree of political discipline. The masses' first impression and understanding of the troops often uses the troops' discipline as the standard, so every person must start by observing political discipline and use strict mass discipline to gain the support and belief of the masses.

(2) Active actions and combat victories should be used to arouse the masses and enhance their anti-Japanese sentiment and confidence in victory.

(3) Mass work is the most important link in our entire work. Do not view it as merely the work of political organs, political personnel, or mass movement workers. Every one of us should become a model for propaganda, organization, and leadership of the masses, and the most active member in participating in mass work.

(4) Cherish the masses, delve into the masses' problems, accept the masses' opinions, and also learn from the masses and become one with the masses.

(5) Protect the interests of the masses, improve the lives of the masses, and give the masses democracy and freedom. (End)

### Progress of Various Battles in Guangdong, × Troops in Fujian Sea Repeatedly Attempt Landings Without Success, × Intrusion Plan in Hubei Fails

[Special Dispatch from Shaoguan, This Newspaper, 5th] In Guangdong, our counter-attacking army has crossed south of Xinjie and is still in fierce battle with the ×. A large number of our plainclothes teams have infiltrated the vicinity of Shijing and suburban Guangzhou, and × are extremely active. It is heard that most of the × troops in Foshan have withdrawn, and唐佈吿 have been posted, enticing our people to submit to the puppet organization. According to information indirectly obtained from various sources: (1) On the Hainan front, 200 × troops with more than 10 armored vehicles from Jiaji attacked the Anhangshi Dalu area on the 1st. They were intercepted by our regular army and guerrilla teams, and are still in a stalemate with the ×. We killed dozens of × and destroyed 2 vehicles. Our side suffered injuries to a lieutenant platoon leader, 1, and 2 soldiers; (2) On the Nan'an front, yesterday the × troops attacking Xiaolukeng and Xiaowo were fiercely attacked by us, and are now being pursued to Yangmei; (3) On the Jianghui front, the × troops in Huicheng have been besieged by us for days, suffering heavy casualties. They appear to be breaking out and retreating to Jiangmen. The × near Linkeng Zhongshan were killed by us dozens, and the remnants collapsed. The shallow-water gunboats of the Jiujiang Heqing × shelled Gulao yesterday morning, we suffered no losses.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Although the Japanese army in the Fujian sea has shelled Fuzhou and its surrounding areas for days and sent aircraft for extensive bombing, it has made several attempts to land in Lianjiang, but has not yet succeeded. The Chinese army on the coast of Fujian Province is now calmly fighting. Furthermore, residents in various coastal areas remain extremely calm and have not shown any signs of panic. According to observers here, the actual strength of the Japanese army in the Fujian sea is still insufficient to launch a major landing in Fuzhou, as a large number of Chinese troops have arrived in various coastal areas of Fujian Province in recent days.

Situation in the Hubei-Jiangxi War Zone

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] According to news from Hubei Province, the Japanese army east of the Hanshui River originally planned to join forces with the Japanese army advancing west from Tingxi to Qianjiang and launch another major offensive, but was forced to abandon its plan due to the continuous and fierce counterattacks by the Chinese army.

[Central News Agency, Ji'an, 4th] Seventeen aircraft in batches attacked Jiangxi on the 4th. The first batch of three aircraft invaded the urban area of Ji'an at around 7 a.m., dropping four bombs in the suburbs, killing one civilian. The second batch of three aircraft sneaked to Dengjiapu, a subordinate of Chujiang County, at around 8 a.m., dropping six bombs, all of which landed in the wilderness, causing no losses. The × aircraft then sneaked to Shangrao. The third batch of six aircraft invaded Ji'an at around 7 a.m., dropping more than 20 bombs, destroying more than 10 civilian houses and injuring more than civilians. The fourth batch of three aircraft sneaked to Jicheng at around 7 a.m. to spy. The fifth batch of one aircraft invaded the city of Ji'an at around 9 a.m. for reconnaissance. At the same time, one × aircraft reconnoitered along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for a long time.

Jilu Victory News

[Minge News Agency, Changzhi, 5th] More than 600 × from Qiuxian Guantao in southern Hebei have invaded Guantao in three routes since the 26th of last month. The village was blocked north and south, and after our unit intercepted them, a fierce battle lasted all day, completely routing the ×. It is estimated that 60 or 70 × were killed. On the 24th, the × reinforcements from Tingcun An'er were reinforced, and another unit of × also scurried from Nanbeiji Gou to Suzhuang and confronted our unit.

[Central News Agency, Somewhere in northern Shandong, 4th] The day before yesterday, our army in northern Shandong launched an attack on the × in the Zhangzhuang area northeast of Dezhou, fighting for several hours, killing more than 150 ×. Another unit of ours attacked the south gate of Pingyuan, engaging in a fierce battle with the × all night. The × could not hold out and scurried into the city. In this battle, more than 100 × were killed and 8 × soldiers were captured.

Victory in Shanxi Battle

[Minge News Agency, Xixian, 5th] Our unit attacked the × at Shiling, a subordinate of Lingshi, the night before, eliminating more than 40 × sentries and capturing more than 20 rifles, 1 machine gun, and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition.

[Minge News Agency, Hefei, 5th] After our army recovered Pianguan, the × at Shenchi were very panicked, ambushing in the mountain gullies in the suburbs of the city every night to prevent our advance. The × at Shuoxian and Naihebao have been levying military supplies and salaries in recent days, claiming that they will attack our Liminbao. Our army is closely monitoring them. At noon on the 25th, four × aircraft flew over Liminbao for a long time for reconnaissance.4

[Minge News Agency, Xingji, 5th] The × at Pingshan, in response to the eastward invasion of Wutai, attempted to open up the Pingwu transportation. Since the 19th of last month, they have been attacking our Xiaojuexia area via Hongzidian, northwest of Pingshan. At the same time, the × at Shangshe in northern Mengxian also attacked eastward via Huidong, attempting to join up with the × attacking Xiaojuexia and launch a major westward invasion. They are currently engaged in a fierce battle with our unit in the Xiaojuexia Lizhiwan area. Furthermore, 20 × aircraft have been constantly reconnoitering between Xiaojuexia and Bailing for days.

Anze × Revives Three Routes of Harassment

[Minge News Agency, Changzhi, 5th] After the × at Anze invaded Guyang (north of Anze) on the 26th of last month, they have continued to harass Anhe, Dadonggou, Zuoyingshan, and Shanjiao in recent days. Another unit of more than 600 advanced north from Anze towards Junmiao, scurrying into Shanjiao on the evening of the same day and joining forces with the × at Qingyang, and then divided into three routes to advance towards Beipingzhen. Our unit ambushed along the way and fought fiercely with the × all night. By the morning of the 29th, our unit again maneuvered to attack the flank of the ×, preparing to wipe out the ×.

### The Disastrous Defeat at Zhongtiaoshan, × Suffers Huge Losses, Forcibly Conscripting Thousands of Our Able-Bodied Men

[Minge News Agency, Xiangning, 5th] The × suffered a setback in the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi, with heavy casualties. In recent days, they have been conscripting a large number of able-bodied men in the Linfen area. The day before yesterday, 3,000 able-bodied men from Hongdong Zhaocheng were forced by the × into Linfen City. Many who tried to escape along the way were shot and killed. Furthermore, the puppet police team in Lingshi has been forcibly conscripting able-bodied men from various villages, three from each neighborhood, claiming that they are being compiled into security squads, but in reality, most of them are being transported to various battlefields.

### Chairman Chiang's Hand-Written Instructions, The Key Points of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance, Taking the Initiative to Fight, Relying on Our Own Efforts, Preparing for a Bitter Struggle, The Guangdong Military Region Issues Orders to Comply With

[Shaoguan News] The National Military Training Department of the Guangdong Military Region Command recently issued an order, stating that the second phase of the War of Resistance is now unfolding, and the responsibility of this department is becoming more important, and our work is becoming more extensive. Regarding the key points of the second phase of the War of Resistance, the leader has enlightened us with a handwritten instruction, which is clear and profound, and of great importance. It is appropriate to copy and circulate this order for knowledge, and to encourage everyone to work together and conscientiously implement it in order to win the final victory. Now, Chairman Chiang's handwritten instructions on the key points of the second phase of the War of Resistance are transcribed as follows:

The key points of the second phase of the War of Resistance: 1. Politics is more important than military affairs; 2. The people are more important than soldiers. It is better to use the people than to use soldiers, and it is better to teach the people than to teach soldiers. Teaching soldiers is the spirit of teaching one's own children; 3. Spirit is more important than material. Two things should be used for two purposes, one bullet should be used as two bullets, and one day should be used as two days. It all depends on spirit to supplement the insufficiency of material; 4. Organization should emphasize practicality (not position). The military supplies, military medicine, staff, adjutant, intelligence, communications, transportation, and various organs should be reorganized and inspected, and the ability and academic qualifications of personnel should be carefully examined to ensure that they are competent and responsible, so as to comprehensively match name and reality, increase work efficiency, and achieve the mission of the War of Resistance; 5. Training is more important than combat. The selection, examination, and training of cadres are particularly important, and must be continuously trained in rotation in stages. Inspections must also be conducted regularly, and grades A and B must be evaluated and announced monthly; 6. Intelligence is more important than judgment and imagination; 7. Study the situation of the ×, pay attention to the selection of intelligence personnel, analyze the current and future practical environment, and develop various work plans; 8. Reorganizing is more important than purchasing. We must reorganize, repair, manage, and process; 9. Propaganda is more important than combat; 10. Discipline is more important than everything; 11. Orders are more important than life. In order to execute orders, even sacrificing one's life is worth it. Listened to the donation of life; 12. Action is more important than theory; 13. Group meetings, reviewing work, and self-criticism are more important than formal education; 14. Various work plans and instructions must be executed regularly, and the effectiveness must be inspected to assess rewards and punishments; 15. Special skills are more important than broad learning. It must be simple and easy to understand; 16 (The importance of common sense). With common sense, one can adapt to the situation based on the location, time, person, and object; 17. Retrenchment is more important than production, and frugality is more important than abundance; 18. Law, political economy, scientific common sense, and the theory of the Three Principles of the People and its philosophical foundation; 19. Construction and creation are more important than war. Our military generals must realize that the foundation of the victory of the War of Resistance in the future lies entirely in our ability to fight independently, rely on our own efforts, and be thrifty, hardworking, and tolerant in everything, be independent and self-reliant, and prepare for five or ten years of bitter struggle, so that the ultimate goal of the War of Resistance can be achieved.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th] Preventive measures have begun here to prevent any violent actions that may occur on the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War. Obstacles have been installed at several intersections, and police will search for战之 weapons and explosives. British and American sailors and the Russian team of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will patrol the streets to maintain order. Armored vehicle teams will also patrol, and other team members are prepared to be dispatched immediately if necessary. The Japanese army in the Hongkou area has also begun to be on alert, and is strictly searching Chinese pedestrians.

### British Engineer Arrested by ×, Not Released by Yesterday's Deadline, Britain to Negotiate with Japan

[Reuters, Tianjin, 5th] A Japanese spokesman said at a press conference today that Mr. Lowry, engineer of the British liner Yuezhou No. 1, was arrested on the 1st of this month and will be released today.

[Reuters, Tianjin, 5th] Engineer Griffiths of the British liner "Yuezhou" has not yet been released by the Japanese. British authorities will continue to negotiate with the Japanese tomorrow.

### North China × Chieftain Sugiyama's Delirium, Actually Urging British Authorities to be Pro-Japanese, Jointly Building a ×× New Order

[Reuters, Tianjin, 5th] Sugiyama, commander of the Japanese army in North China, arrived here yesterday to learn the details of the Tianjin incident, and returned to Peiping today. According to Japanese reports, Sugiyama met with reporters and said that although the Tokyo negotiations have begun, the control of Tianjin transportation should not be relaxed. He also urged the British Concession Board of Works to abandon its pro-Chiang attitude and cooperate with Japan to establish a "New Order in East Asia."

### Deputy Commander Qiao, A Family of Martyrs, Refusing to be a Puppet, Father Killed, Son Injured While Leading Soldiers

[Minge News Agency, Yulin, 5th] Since Qiao Quanqing, deputy commander of the Weilu of a certain army in Suiyuan, led a regiment of his troops at the end of March and fiercely attacked Gugulian, south of Qingshuihe, hundreds of × troops stubbornly resisted, and a stalemate lasted for half a day. After the × reinforced with 14 trucks full of reinforcements, the battle situation turned fierce. Our side had quite a few gains in this battle. It is heard that Commander Qiao was seriously injured because he took the lead. According to the news, Qiao is from Qingshuihe and graduated from the Central Military Academy. He is known for his loyalty, courage, and righteousness, and is hated by the ×. The × had previously kidnapped his father, hoping to make him a puppet, but he refused to be set up. Now Qiao has been injured for the country again, which can be called a loyal man.

### President Kong's Broadcast to the US: US-China Relations are Cordial to a Gratifying Extent; Efforts Still Needed to Aid Our War of Resistance and National Reconstruction

[Chongqing, Central News Agency, 5th] On the 4th, American Independence Day, President Kong gave a special broadcast speech to the American people, expressing our country's gratification with the current close relationship between China and the United States, and gratitude to the United States for the encouragement and assistance given to our country during the period of our War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. The text of President Kong's speech is as follows:

Today marks the 163rd anniversary of the American Declaration of Independence. I am very pleased to be able to speak to the American people on this commemorative day. On behalf of the Chinese people, I extend to you my most sincere congratulations and wish you an infinitely glorious future. All those with free thought in the world should celebrate the emergence of the great American Republic. The American Declaration of Independence is not only the highest expression of human freedom and equality, but also the establishment of a country that has contributed to human progress and world peace and order no less than any other country. The birth of your country has greatly stimulated the growth of modern democracy. The history of your nation is full of great achievements of human perseverance and struggle, such as pioneers, colonizers, the age of machines, modern commerce and industry, the rise of common people to power, and the improvement of human life. If the entire world could have the opportunity to maintain peace and happiness as the United States does, then human life could be raised to a high level. Your country's efforts in the "Open Door" policy, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact have created your country's position and honor in the international community. I join you today in celebration. If I did not express to you our country's gratification with the long-standing and cordial relationship between China and the United States, and our gratitude for the encouragement and assistance your country has given us during the period of our War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, then I would not be able to speak on behalf of the Chinese people. In terms of commerce, education, culture, and international affairs, the United States has become China's friend and guide. Recently, your government's measures to purchase Chinese silver and extend the credit period for Chinese loans have provided our country with practical assistance in maintaining finance and the legal tender. The people's efforts to help China in its war disasters have given our country sympathy and financial aid, encouraging our people to firmly resist aggression for freedom. The Chinese people are grateful for the friendship of the American people, a friendship built on the close relationship between the two nations.

I am unable to celebrate with you today, but some of you may still remember that two years ago, I attended the glorious Fourth of July celebration in your country. The world at that time was more pleasant than today, because today we are troubled by war and war rumors. The inspiration given to us by the Declaration of Independence and the international agreements jointly protected by China and the United States has been affected by the war and aggression found in most of the world today. The spirit of understanding and coordination has succumbed to barbaric violence. The dignity of international law and conventions has been trampled upon. The international security system has been greatly threatened. Humanity seems to have been forced into another "Dark Age". Human progress is being prevented, and culture is on the verge of danger. The war of independence fought by a quarter of the world's population on Chinese soil has been going on for two years. Japan's modern armaments cause the death and destruction of our innocent people every day, devastating our undefended cities and remote towns hundreds of miles away from the front lines. The terror, brutality, and lawlessness brought about by Japanese aggression are not only intolerable to civilized people in the 20th century, but also offend the intellect and solemnity of mankind. The place where I am speaking now is a city with such unfortunate experiences. It has been repeatedly bombed by Japanese planes, innocent people have been massacred, and civilian property has been destroyed.

Can Japan's bombs and machine guns scare the Chinese people into submission? Our Republic, though young, has a national system similar to that of your country. But will our country perish under Japanese aggression? Four hundred and fifty million Chinese souls all say "No". Japan's terror tactics cannot destroy our spirit, cannot destroy our national soul, and can only strengthen our will to resist. It is indeed difficult for us to resist aggression with imperfect armaments, but we have the determination to resist to the end. We are determined to resist aggression, and for two years now, we have broken the myth of the invincible Japanese army. We are determined to continue the war of resistance, no matter how many years it takes, until Japan understands that China cannot be conquered and until China gains freedom and regeneration from the arduous war of resistance. We firmly believe that the final victory will belong to us, because we know that justice and fairness are on our side. We are fighting for human freedom and equality. We are fighting for our "land", for our sacred families, for our magnificent antiquities, for our peaceful progress, for our national survival and independence. Moreover, the purpose of our war of resistance is to fight for civilized mankind. We resist the aggression of international plunderers. We resist the primary enemy of international security. We resist the plague of aggression and the disturbers of world peace. We resist militarists. We resist the executioners of democracy and popular self-determination. We resist the new state of "undeclared war," such as looting, bombing, massacring non-combatants in undefended cities, destroying cultural institutions, disregarding the rights of neutral countries, and infringing upon the sovereignty of neutral countries, such as the famous Panay incident. We resist the domineering military power that is fantasizing about Japan's "sacred mission" to rule the world. Its invasion of China is the first step in an attempt to realize the dream of dominating Asia, controlling the Pacific, and ruling the world. We resist ambitious aggressor nations. If these countries can control China's manpower and resources, they will not hesitate to extend their greedy hands to seize the land of other countries in the Pacific and Asia, or even invade their borders. Our war of resistance can be said to be not only for our own country, but also for your country and the world. At the same time, we are also fighting for the innocent people and laborers of Japan who are currently oppressed by the military, because we firmly believe that the final victory of justice in Asia will give the Japanese people freedom and will not allow them to suffer under feudal forces.

With this belief, our people feel gratified, even though they are making extremely tragic sacrifices in the war of resistance against aggression. We are not discouraged, but rather feel honored to make this great sacrifice, because we are fighting for world freedom and peace. We persist in this goal and continue to struggle, because without peace and freedom, life has no purpose. Your country's great patriot, Patrick Henry, once said, "Give me liberty, or give me death." We certainly share the same feeling.

Moreover, the maintenance of international law and justice is not a matter for one country. Closing one's eyes and ignoring world events cannot protect one's rights, because this is no different from an ostrich burying its head in the sand to avoid danger. A robber attacking a neighbor's door, hiding in a quilt, cannot guarantee his own safety. A neighbor's house catching fire, covering the windows and doors, cannot guarantee that his house will not be affected. America's peace and security cannot be separated from the world. To seek peace, one must strive for peace. To seek security, one must pay the price of security.

I would like to tell you that Japan's engagement in war is not entirely its own doing. Its invasion of China relies on other countries, especially the United States, to supply it with military materials and armaments. To purchase military supplies, it must also sell its products. For example, Japan must buy scrap iron and cotton from your country, but it must sell its raw silk to your country. With this relationship, Japanese aggressors can be contained. At the same time, the American people also have the opportunity to help stop the ambitions of the Japanese island nation. With economic power alone, the United States can defeat Japan. Once the United States strengthens its economic sanctions against Japan, Japan's feet of clay will be unable to extricate themselves. The United States can stop Japan's aggression without participating in the war.

Today, as we celebrate the American Declaration of Independence, I feel ashamed to mention the international threat to the principles listed in the Declaration of Independence. But as far as China is concerned, everything is clear and everything has been arranged. We are fighting our third year of the war of independence in Asia, only drawing inspiration from the great sacrifices of your country's ancestors, and striving to win freedom and equality. I look forward to the day when "world peace and human friendship" will arrive, when the two great republics of the Pacific will commemorate the idea that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish" and celebrate with each other.

### My View of the Battlefield - Former Commander-in-Chief of the Xth War Zone

— Luo Zhuoying

The sacred war of national resistance against Japan has just reached its second anniversary. The true experience of the great battlefield makes me feel more deeply that war is destruction, but also creation, elimination, and also purification.

The feudal remnants of old Chinese society, and the selfish, self-interested, complacent, and cowardly inferior nature,

were destroyed by the ruthless artillery fire. However, on the other hand, you will know: what is newly created on the battlefield is the most advanced model of the universe and mankind, and the vibrant, bright, hot, and powerful new Chinese national spirit.

In the sound of artillery fire, there are inevitably many people who are physically weak, lack courage, are weak in will, and even willingly degenerate, who are eliminated by the raging waves of war. However, in another situation, you may know that countless new citizens without education, especially enthusiastic young people, are being tempered by the furnace of war, and are becoming more solid and lively. Brave and capable, they walk onto the battlefield with their chests held high and smiles on their faces, to defend their motherland.

I believe that this is a symbol of the revival of the Chinese nation, a force for the creation of a new China, and a reliable guarantee of the final victory of the War of Resistance.

For this reason, I often have three kinds of imaginations about the battlefield:

First, I imagine the battlefield as a "testing ground", where it is best to test who is capable, who is incapable or unwilling, who is competent, who is incompetent, who is brave, who is cowardly; who is willing to seek progress and accept purification, and who is willing to give up and be eliminated by nature.

Second, I imagine the battlefield as a "school", where soldiers are trained while fighting, and where they study while fighting. While working, they also teach, taking the front line and trenches as classrooms, and fighting as a daily lesson. At the same time, they are also preparing to use their war achievements to create a new Chinese military science.

Third, on the contrary, I imagine the battlefield as a "sea". In this vast, bottomless sea, where the waves rise and fall, anything can be accommodated. We must completely eliminate the limited Japanese invaders in this sea, so that they cannot return with a single piece of armor!

### A Toad Wants to Eat Swan Meat (Part 2) - The Japanese Army Coerces and Threatens Us to Negotiate Peace

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya

"What about the 'words' of the Chinese people before, and the facts of 'pouring' today?"

"North China, Central China, and South China are completely in the hands of Japan. The Party government is about to present internal disputes. As a result, the great figure Wang Jingwei went to Shanghai to flee..." How great is the great figure? I am afraid that even Wang Jingwei himself would have doubts, let alone the people in the war zone.

It also says: "The people of Japan and China are both East Asian compatriots, and it is appropriate for them to shake hands with each other to practice friendship." Afterwards, there are also photos of female stars, each making an ecstatic gesture; the so-called Imperial Proclamation is nothing more than this!

Another Disguise of Leaflets

The Japanese spread some nonsensical leaflets and issue some stuttering proclamations. Knowing that their treacherous schemes are difficult to sell and will inevitably fail, they then temporarily print these small-sized color newspapers from the perspective of a certain "Chinese person", in an attempt to deceive our people in the war zone again. However, bad seeds will never grow good seedlings. The paper is full of distorted theories, even more like a crazy girl applying white powder, which only increases her ugliness.

For example, there is a so-called "Peace Newspaper," published by the "Reorganized Comrades Association of the Chinese Kuomintang." The first red-letter headline on the first page fabricates news about how the national government is being reorganized: "President of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke; Minister of Military Affairs, XXX; Minister of Political Affairs, Zhou Enlai; Vice Minister of Military Affairs, Lin Biao." Except for Zhou Enlai, who originally served as the Vice Minister of the Political Department, everyone knows that the rest are all fabrications.

Next is a special article, which publishes the traitor Jingwei's "Open Letter to Mr. Chiang Kai-shek," which roughly states that "Japan has abandoned aggression by using troops to fight (?)" Wang is determined to deceive people, and still urges Chairman Chiang to negotiate peace with Japan quickly.

Then there is "Wang Zhaoming's Third Statement," the main idea of which is to defend his advocacy of peace with Japan, which is something that should be done a thousand times over, and to refute the Central Government's decision to expel him from the party and, in particular, to issue a warrant for his arrest. In the article, there is a sentence that says, "Now I (Wang himself) am indeed said to be Qin Hui by a part of the people." The editor (with a Japanese accent) added a note at the end of the article, which roughly stated that "Qin Hui was a person from the Southern Song Dynasty after the Sui and Tang Dynasties. At that time, Yue Fei, who was famous throughout the world 150 years (?) ago, trusted him and appointed him as prime minister. Later, he left Yue Fei and negotiated peace with the Jin people alone. The world criticized him as a traitor. Now Wang Zhaoming is very similar to him, so a part of the people (more than a part) scold him as a traitor. But the people should know: as a result, Yue Fei was killed by Qin Hui." Good heavens, Wang Jingwei wants to kill today's Yue Fei—countless national heroes. What a great ability to sell the country. Doesn't he feel ashamed to say it?

Later, they fabricated a telegram saying that Li Zongren, Chen Cheng, Xue Yue, and others were praising Wang Jingwei, and had jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang: "Give Wang an opportunity to roll up his sleeves and start again." In fact, Li, Chen, Xue, and others, who doesn't know that they are famous anti-Japanese generals with glorious achievements? In particular, when General Li talked to reporters about the traitor Wang's problem, ×××××××××! As for the so-called praise, even a three-year-old child would not believe it.

The second page of the "Peace Newspaper" is called "Rocket," which has a short commentary that says, "China should have resisted Japan at the time of the September 18th Incident, from the Chinchow Agreement, to even the fall of Wuhan, and even when Japan repeatedly offered to accept peace, China should have jumped into its arms..." This is simply nonsense. Next, they praise those smelly little feet that the world has long disdained—all the traitorous theories are chewed over and over again.

The third page is called "South Wind" (South Wind is stealing the name of the literary and art section of the Yunnan Daily), but it is full of pornographic writing. For example, they cut and arranged a section of a long pornographic novel from a certain Hong Kong tabloid on it, but they do not indicate that it is a reprint. In addition, they insert nude photos of Western prostitutes, as well as obscene pictures that are unbearable to look at. Their wishful thinking must be that in this way, they can anesthetize our military and civilians in the war zone so that they cannot even fire their guns. However, the folk customs of Qin and Jin are simple and ancient, and they are most taboo about advocating theft and obscenity. The Japanese sending out this kind of lewd pictures and texts will only cause extreme resentment: the new youth laugh at their dirty methods, and the elderly are simply upset because it damages public morals.

### Su-French-Soviet Negotiations Have Not Yet Fully Matured; Although the Baltic Sea Problem Has Been Solved, Guarantees to the Netherlands and Switzerland Have Created New Difficulties

[Reuters, London, 5th] According to diplomatic reporters here, the recent obstacles in the Moscow negotiations are due to the Soviet Union's unwillingness to provide anti-aggression guarantees to the Netherlands and Switzerland, because the two countries have not yet officially recognized the Soviet government. However, the British government has made further concessions and is approaching the Soviet demands in order to guarantee the Baltic countries. The "Daily Express" stated that Britain has recently notified the Soviet Union that it is willing to guarantee the Baltic countries, but the tripartite agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must be expanded to include guarantees to the Netherlands and Switzerland, as well as countries already guaranteed by Britain and France, such as Poland, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, and Portugal. The "News Chronicle" stated that new difficulties seem to have arisen in the British-Soviet negotiations. The British side believes that if guarantees are needed for countries along the German border, then guarantees should also be given to countries on other borders. The "Daily Mail" also expressed similar views on the British-Soviet negotiations, and said that people in the government and the House of Commons are gradually recognizing that the Soviet Union is deliberately delaying the negotiations in order to undermine Chamberlain's position. Supporters of the government were previously extremely concerned about the British-Soviet agreement and hoped that it would be established as soon as possible, but are now disappointed by its indefinite extension. Some members of Congress even believe that if the British-Soviet agreement has any value, it will be reduced due to the long delay.

(Reuters, London, 5th) According to the opinions of some diplomatic reporters, there are still difficulties in expanding the scope of guarantees in the Moscow negotiations. It is heard that Britain has accepted the Soviet demands and is willing to guarantee the three Baltic countries, but requires that the Soviet-British agreement must also guarantee the Netherlands and Switzerland. The Times commented today that no country in the world should join the guarantee system against its will. Therefore, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should quickly sign a treaty of mutual assistance. At the same time, Britain and France can use diplomacy to encourage the Baltic countries to understand that it is the best way to protect their true interests to form an alliance with the three anti-aggression countries.

[Reuters, London, 4th] According to Soviet sources in London, the recent British proposal has further catered to the Soviet point of view. At present, all issues have not been fully clarified. It is heard that the two sides are closer on the Baltic Sea issue, but there are still some points that need to be clarified further.

[Reuters, Moscow, 4th] Authoritative sources here do not believe the widespread rumors that the British-French-Soviet agreement has actually been completed and will be signed soon. Although the negotiations are progressing very well, there is no indication whether the problem of guaranteeing the Baltic Sea coast countries has been resolved. Well-informed sources believe that Molotov's reply contains the need to further discuss the proposal, so the negotiations will need to be extended for some time.

[Reuters, London, 4th] Reuters' diplomatic correspondent learned from well-informed sources that the widespread rumors that the British-French-Soviet anti-aggression negotiations have been completed are somewhat premature. The negotiations were originally hoped to be concluded at this time, but some points raised in the Soviet reply obviously need to be considered further. It is heard that the two sides are immediately continuing to negotiate other matters, and it is hoped that the agreement will not be delayed.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 4th] Today, all the newspapers here are criticizing the British-Soviet negotiations with a reserved attitude. Most newspapers only reported that the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union and British special envoy Strang had met with Foreign Minister Molotov again. Some political figures here believe that the Soviet press has not criticized the recent British-French proposals, which they consider to be a "hopeful symbol."

### The Future of the Tokyo Negotiations is Completely Bleak; The Views of the Two Sides are Diametrically Opposed; Failure and Stranding are Inevitable

[Foreign News from Hong Kong] Since the British and Japanese sides put forward their demands in the Tokyo negotiations, well-informed sources believe that the negotiations may end in failure. According to the Japanese side's Domei News Agency, the British authorities notified the Japanese side that the prerequisite for the British negotiations was that the Japanese side stop blockading the British Concession. On the other hand, the Japanese side demanded that 50 million yuan of Chinese capital deposited in Chinese banks within the British Concession should be transferred to the Japanese side before negotiations could begin. Therefore, it is generally believed that the negotiations may be stranded due to these diametrically opposed points. At present, it is slim to persuade the Japanese army in Tianjin to ease its blockade of the British Concession. In fact, it has been tightened since last Saturday. Tokyo believes that the British authorities will refuse to transfer the Chinese deposits. Some sources claim that the deposits have already been moved from the Tianjin British Concession to a British warship.

[Reuters, London, 5th] According to reports, the Japanese military authorities are now "repeatedly seeking various methods to obtain British assistance for Japanese currency in North China and to acquiesce in Japan's actions to invade China." The Times diplomatic correspondent quoted the above report and said, "If the Japanese side raises this point, then the Tokyo negotiations will not make any progress. The British government is prepared to guarantee the neutrality of the Tianjin Concession to Japan, and to extradite the four Chinese suspects to the Japanese side upon confirmation of their crimes. But other than this, Britain cannot arbitrarily accept any demands."

Calls for Toughness

[Reuters, London, 5th] Last night, two experts on Far Eastern issues gave speeches in London on the future of China. Prominent news correspondent Ding Bairui spoke to representatives of Parliament, believing that the Tianjin issue was a probing action. If Britain shows a slight concession to Japan, then the possibility of cooperation between the United States and Britain in the Far East and Europe will also be hopeless. If Britain can take resolute steps, then the United States is willing to support Britain in the Far East and Europe, so that Britain can take a firmer position. Far Eastern economic expert Gabo Chick also gave a speech to the 1912 Club at the same time, saying that it is not clear when the Japanese warlords will end the war without declaring war as soon as possible, making their victory a mirage. Domestic commercial finance has been greatly affected. Japan's misfortunes are entirely the result of the arrogance of the Japanese warlords. The war without declaring war will end with a peace without declaring. It is not easy for Britain to maintain its business in China. However, we must strengthen our entire policy towards Japan.

[Haitong News Agency, Chongqing, 5th] Yesterday, the Chinese newspapers here jointly published a commentary criticizing the British-Japanese negotiations to be held in Tokyo, warning Britain to beware of the Japanese tricks, and urging them not to be confused by Japanese diplomats.

Japan Intensifies Anti-British Sentiment

[Reuters, Shanghai, 4th] The anti-British movement in various Japanese-controlled areas has intensified. A demonstration was held in Qingdao yesterday in front of the British Consulate. They wanted to post anti-British slogans on the walls of the consulate, but were stopped. Other locations in the city were plastered with them. The Japanese are vigorously encouraging the Chinese to be anti-British, but the Chinese have not shown any real anti-British sentiment.

[Reuters, Xiamen Correspondent] On the 29th of last month, the Japanese again made a new request to the Gulangyu Public Concession Bureau, requesting the appointment of a Japanese police officer. The Concession Bureau had previously agreed to appoint three Japanese detectives. The newly appointed Japanese police officer will cooperate with the Japanese consular police, and his position will be second only to the police chief, and his responsibility will be to provide the police chief with opinions on police affairs. Currently, the police chief is assisted by a foreign police officer and a Japanese deputy police officer. Since the Japanese army implemented the blockade, the lack of food in Gulangyu has become increasingly serious. Meat and vegetables are very scarce, and their prices have increased more than twice as much as usual. Almost all foreigners rely on canned food supplies, while most of the 60,000 Chinese people maintain a minimum standard of living. The Concession Bureau has tried to transport in wood. The newspapers in Gulangyu controlled by the Japanese are condemning the Concession Bureau, saying that the Concession Bureau should be fully responsible for the current situation in Gulangyu.

### German-Polish Dispute: The Pope to Act as Mediator; Poland Denies Issuing Note; Chamberlain Said to Be Issuing Declaration

(Haitong Agency, London, 5th) According to sources in the press here, British Prime Minister Chamberlain will issue a declaration in the House of Commons today clarifying Britain's guarantee to Poland, including any changes in the political situation in Danzig. The "Daily Express" states that Chamberlain will specify that any unilateral change in Danzig's status, regardless of the method, will cause Britain to implement its guarantee to Poland. This British attitude will prevent Danzig from using force to change its status. The only method of negotiation to bring about political changes in Danzig remains possible.

(Haitong Agency, Paris, 4th) According to news published in British and French newspapers last week, the Polish government will issue a note to Danzig requesting an explanation of Danzig's military measures. This claim has been denied by Danzig. After a meeting between the Polish ambassador to France and the French Foreign Minister yesterday afternoon, sources close to the French Foreign Ministry stated that Warsaw has not yet sent this note to Danzig and does not anticipate sending it in the future. The French Ambassador to Poland, Noël, is currently in Paris and will soon return to his post. Before leaving, he will visit Foreign Minister Bonnet for discussions.

(Haitong Agency, Vatican City, 5th) The Pope has not yet given up on mediating the serious international situation, especially the dispute between Germany and Poland. Local circles are paying particular attention to the return to Rome of the Holy See's representative to Poland after a lengthy discussion with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. At the same time, the long-vacant position of Polish Ambassador to the Vatican has recently been filled by the government. Although the Polish press strongly denies that the Pope will act as a mediator, local circles still hope that the Pope will advise Poland to adopt a more moderate attitude.

[Haitong Agency, Vatican City, 5th] Pope Pius XII, originally scheduled to go to Castel Gandolfo for the summer, has postponed his trip by one or two weeks because papal diplomatic representatives are currently active in various countries, holding negotiations in the hope of alleviating the serious international situation.

### British Parliament Questions Japanese Tea Misrepresented as British Tea; Anglo-American Goods Exchange Agreement Soon to Be Implemented

[Reuters, London, 4th] Today, British Minister of Commerce Stanley reported in the House of Commons that during the period from January to May of this year, 2.25 million pounds of tea were imported from Japan, accounting for 1.5% of total tea imports during the same period. He learned that Japanese tea of ​​inferior quality was sold at six or seven pence per pound (including tax), and that these teas were mixed with teas produced in Britain for cheaper sale. He has no power to stop its import. Labor MP Sorensen asked if the Minister knew that Japanese tea was being mixed with Ceylon tea and Indian tea from the Empire and sold as Empire tea. Stanley replied that if Mr. Sorensen could provide accurate information on this matter, he would investigate it. However, the information he himself had obtained indicated that the situation was not as such, so under current law, he had no power to stop it. Stanley also answered supplementary questions, stating that the tea was not being misrepresented as being from the Empire.

[Reuters, London, 4th] Labor MP Sorensen today asked in the House of Commons about the latest developments in the Anglo-American Goods Exchange Agreement and whether the British government had made further provisions with the US government or other governments. Stanley replied that the US Senate had approved the agreement. The legislature is now considering authorizing the US government to purchase the necessary cotton goods. It is hoped that once this necessary authority has been obtained, the agreement can take effect immediately.

### Italian Soldiers to Assist [Japan] in Combat

[Reuters, Rome, 5th] According to reliable sources here, some Italian soldiers who have returned from Spain have recently re-enlisted to assist Japan in the war against China. Some of them have already departed for Naples.

### British King to Visit Belgium in October

[Reuters, London, 4th] Buckingham Palace has officially announced that the King and Queen of England have accepted the invitation of the King of Belgium to pay a formal visit to Brussels from October 24th to 27th this year, in return for the Belgian King's visit to London in November 1937.

### Overseas Chinese in the US Enthusiastically Commemorate "July 7th"; "China Week" in New York Has Begun

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd] "China Week," organized by overseas Chinese in New York, has begun. Renowned Chinese female aviator Li Xiaqing and Lingnan University President Li Yinglin will both give speeches. This week is the second anniversary of China's war of resistance. At that time, overseas Chinese will hold a July 7th commemoration, and overseas Chinese children will perform for the spirits of fallen soldiers of the Chinese army in front of their memorial tablet.

### British War Secretary Speech Explains the Permanent Solidarity of Britain and France; Resolutely Deal With External Provocations

(Reuters, Paris, 4th) British Secretary of War Hore-Belisha delivered a speech at the annual banquet of the Anglo-French Association tonight, emphasizing British-French solidarity in the face of external provocations. He said, "Let the world understand that Britain and France fully understand the nature of external provocations. When necessary, we will resolutely deal with them. The current situation has placed us in a defensive position. It would be a serious mistake for outside observers to draw any erroneous conclusions from this fact. It would be an even greater mistake if those on the side also draw erroneous conclusions. Since we have no intention of aggression, we will certainly not be the first to act. Superficial observers may see this as our weakness, but on the whole, this is our strength." Hore-Belisha then mentioned the close relationship between the British and French armies, saying that they do not keep any military secrets from each other and fully exchange military information, knowledge, and experience. "We live together as partners, and when necessary, we die together as partners. Other government agencies in both countries also have the closest ties. We have developed a system of cooperation based on peacetime experience, which we have repeatedly tested so that it can be implemented in wartime." Hore-Belisha solemnly stated that the cooperation between the two countries is not selfish or exclusive in any way and is prepared to help other countries whose independence is threatened. He then mentioned the British implementation of conscription, stating that the military department had medically examined the first batch of 50,000 conscripts and found that 97% of them were fit for military service. He asked, "Where is the basis for the accusation that we are decadent?" He also stated that the British army, including the regular army and supplemental troops, would reach more than one million within a year and would continue to increase. France possesses the largest army, while Britain possesses the largest navy. Moreover, in terms of production rate, both countries will possess the most modern and powerful air forces. Hore-Belisha concluded by saying, "Britain and France can mutually declare that we have the same thoughts, reach the same conclusions, and embrace the same ideals. We are close friends, we are strong, and we will always stand together."

[Reuters, London, 4th] New Zealand Finance Minister Nash, who has arrived in Ireland, strongly denied foreign reports that he had declared that New Zealand would not send troops to participate when Britain became involved in the war. He said this evening at the Irish branch of the Association of Councils in Dublin, "I have never made such a statement, but only said that New Zealand may not join the treaty obligations of sending troops on expeditions. However, if New Zealand needs to rise up to defend democratic ideals, it will naturally participate. We have assumed the responsibility of defending New Zealand and the interests of the Empire in the South Pacific. When necessary, we will also rise up to defend the entire Empire."

### The Key to Peace and War in Europe

— Shi Chang

Today, the countries of Europe are actively preparing for war. Although, on the surface, everything is peaceful, the underlying tension is known to everyone. According to recent news from various news agencies, German troops and munitions are being transported from East Prussia to Danzig. Nazi Party members are trying to organize volunteer corps in Danzig. The situation in Danzig has reached a very critical point. Although these reports have been denied by German officials, there is no smoke without fire. Europe today is filled with the smell of gunpowder, but in fact, there is no war. The well-known French political commentator Omanson recently commented on the European situation very appropriately; he said: "We are now living in a strange era, neither war nor peace. There is no peace because the activities of the Axis countries have forced most of the countries of Europe into a state of semi-mobilization, and millions of people are therefore horrified. There is no war because all crises have not yet reached an irreparable point, and in fact, no war has yet occurred."

The current situation in Europe is between war and peace. Under this condition, except for the actual outbreak of war, all weapons have been fully prepared; the army and navy have been partially mobilized to prevent accidents; the propaganda apparatus is even more active than usual. In reality, there has not yet been a formal military conflict, but psychological warfare exists at all times.

Germany has repeatedly stated that it does not want war. In the eyes of those who are not very familiar with the European situation, this must be a good phenomenon, the savior of peace. However, the internal reality is not that simple. Germany's goal is to have several more "Munichs," satisfying its desired desires without war.

The Germans are now concentrating all their efforts on dealing with the group of enemies in their minds. They believe that Poland's financial resources cannot indefinitely maintain a million-strong army, and that Britain and France will ultimately be unwilling to wage war in Eastern Europe. However, on the other hand, France has implemented permanent partial mobilization, Britain has adopted conscription, and the British and French navies have close cooperation in the Mediterranean. These are all clever moves in the world political chess game and cannot be ignored.

The current European situation seems to be a chess match in progress. Both sides are evenly matched and can support each other, so there will be no major changes. However, long-term optimism is probably not easy to achieve. The current transitional state cannot be maintained permanently.

Although the situation today is very tense, it is not like 1914. There is still an opportunity to save humanity from disaster. Both the collective and democratic blocs are willing to extend the current period of non-war but preparing for war, because war is a great risk. Chamberlain and Daladier understand this too well and have repeatedly retreated, sacrificing small countries and raising the arrogance of the aggressors; but do Hitler and Mussolini not know the dangers of war?

We can make a reasonable assumption about Germany's future actions: if Germany believes that an attack on Poland will trigger a major war in Europe, then it will not attack Poland, or at least it will have to wait for a more favorable time before taking action. Hitler is not stupid; he will choose a direction with less resistance. It is very likely that Germany will go after Spain, Hungary, or Yugoslavia.

In short, although the current situation is extremely urgent, there is no immediate risk of a major war. The real danger of war lies in one side having a mistaken assessment of the other side's strength and determination; at the same time, it believes that the other side is making rapid progress in national strength (including military, commercial, financial, economic, and industrial aspects) and that if it continues in the same way, it will inevitably become extremely powerful and inviolable. Therefore, rather than waiting for the future, it is better to fight now. This is where the danger of war lies, and it is also the key to peace and war in Europe.

Small Commentary

### International Sympathy

The British Aid China Movement will hold "China Week" on the second anniversary of "July 7th." The American China Week has already begun the day before yesterday. In Leningrad, the Soviet Union, a large-scale Chinese art exhibition is being enthusiastically prepared.

The enthusiastic development of this kind of movement, at the occasion of the second anniversary of the great War of Resistance of the Chinese nation, on the one hand, is sufficient to prove that our country's insistence on resisting the war for two years has increased its international status day by day, and the international community's sympathy and assistance for us have become increasingly widespread; on the other hand, it is sufficient to warn those elements who have begun to waver under the "anti-communist peace" conspiracy activities of the Japanese-puppet traitor Wang Jingwei, and it is sufficient to greatly enhance the self-esteem and self-confidence of our entire nation.

Today, on the one hand, we must seize this international advantage, intensify the diplomatic work of the government and the people, promote a greater and more powerful aid-China movement, strengthen the democratic peace front against aggression, and on the other hand, we must intensify our efforts to combat and eliminate the traitor Wang Jingwei and his group of traitors and country-selling words and deeds, strengthen the unity and solidarity of the entire nation, strive to take the initiative in the comprehensive and protracted war for the final victory, and demonstrate to the people of the world that the Chinese nation is by no means able to be ruled by Japanese-puppet traitors, and demonstrate that the Chinese nation is worthy of being itself and worthy of being the mainstay of world justice and peace.

Spring and Autumn

### Aerial Bombing: Farewell! Airplanes and Bombs

Not long ago, the great historian H.G. Wells, wrote an article in the "News Chronicle" entitled "The Uselessness of Airplane Bombs," talking about the power of the latest invention of aerial explosives.

Let me tell you, I am the inventor of aerial explosives, but I have bad luck. I have sought the Minister of National Defense Adjustment several times, requesting permission to conduct a public test, but have been rejected. Therefore, although I have invented it for a year, it has never come to the fore.

However, I will never be discouraged. I believe that one day, my aerial explosives will make a great splash on the battlefield. Now, let me do a little self-promotion, but every word I say is true.

My aerial bomb has an unusually simple structure: a lighter-than-air balloon, a small bomb, a fuse, a detonating wire, and a clock hand, costing only five shillings in total.

A not-too-large lighter-than-air balloon carries these four small things to the sky, where they float freely in the air. There are two ways to detonate the bomb. If an enemy airplane comes into contact with it, it will naturally perish together. Alternatively, you can set the clock hand to the detonation time, which can range from about one hour to twenty-four hours. When the time you set arrives, the detonating wire explodes first, the fuse is lit, and the bomb explodes. Everything is automatic, without you having to do much.

Naturally, it may not just happen to come into contact with an enemy airplane, but if you release a hundred of them, circling over your head, would the enemy airplanes still dare to come in?

For example, take London! If enemy airplanes come from Europe to attack, we can start releasing the lighter-than-air balloons one by one as soon as we know that they are crossing the English Channel.

It is best if the wind is calm, or there is a little west wind. The lighter-than-air balloons rise into the air and slowly drift eastward with the breeze. By the time the enemy airplane pilots see them, it will be too late to dodge! Coming from all directions, they are sure to shatter the enemies into pieces. The result will be ten thousand times more mythical than Japanese propaganda.

You may see that releasing lighter-than-air balloons one by one is very slow! That's not the case. Two ordinary novices can release two balloons per minute. In just half an hour, four thousand people can release 120,000 balloons!

The ascent of the lighter-than-air balloons is also unusually fast. Ordinarily, it takes thirty minutes to rise to 30,000 feet. Naturally, the speed of ascent is determined by the capacity of the gas. And you can also regulate the weight of the balloon so that it can stay in a certain height space, drifting for a full twenty-four hours.

When the wind is strong, naturally, it is a little more annoying, but it doesn't matter much. The balloons still rise and explode very quickly. As long as the position of the release is shifted a pole in the opposite direction of the wind, then when the wind blows the bombs to this place, they will explode with force.

You may think that with a large pile of bombs in the sky, won't the shattered iron hit the heads of the people below? Indeed, high-explosive shells have this problem. Now, there is nothing like that at all. All the bombs are made of light iron sheets. After they explode, they are all shattered and drift to the ground without any weight. Please rest assured that you will never have any trouble even if you don't wear a hat on your head.

Naturally, the most feared thing is the wind direction. For example, if the west wind suddenly turns to east wind shortly after the balloons are released, then that would be terrible! All the explosives will come back to your own camp. But that's just saying. After all, the wind will not change suddenly at any moment, and the most precise weather tests can predict the wind direction within twelve hours, so what is there to fear?

Furthermore, even if the balloons really retreat to your own head, it doesn't matter. Anyway, we don't use airplanes ourselves, so just let them explode in the sky first! We can also watch a good fireworks display!

Having said so much about the advantages of aerial explosives, I have not yet said the best point, which is the saving of manpower. Pilots and anti-aircraft gunners are all saved, saving so many lives!

Releasing lighter-than-air balloons from below is very safe work, and the procedure is simple. Everyone can do it. It is also much easier to manufacture aerial explosives in factories than to build fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns.

Alright, do you fully understand? Let me tell you, one day, as Mr. Wells said, airplanes will disappear from the world. Watch my aerial explosives come to the fore.

### One Person a Day

Dog Meat General Zhang Zongchang's sworn brother Jiang Guiti was not a very famous person; however, when he was a Garrison Commander in Jehol, his power was no less than that of Dog Meat General Zhang in Shandong.

Old Jiang was also a graduate of the bandit university, completely illiterate, and naturally, there were many jokes!

Once, Old Jiang was hosting a banquet in a Cantonese restaurant, thinking about ordering noodles, but he couldn't make himself understood in any northern or southern language. One of the guests helpfully started writing on paper.

"Oh no! Why did you bring up my Old Jiang's name again?" Jiang Guiti shouted as soon as he saw it.

Everyone was very strange and rushed over to take a look. It turned out that what was written on the paper was "Want noodles".

"Jiang Guiti"

### Answer:

Everyone in the world knows about big things. A woman's mouth is born to tell lies; a man's mouth is born to boast. Especially when a woman is in front of her husband, and a man is in front of his wife, these are the most beautiful scenes for lying and boasting. Naturally, if people are like this, then King Solomon must have been boasting in front of the Queen; therefore, the male butterfly also boasts in front of the female butterfly. Isn't that so?

"Hey, be careful! Don't throw cigarette butts around, it will cause a big fire, that's terrible."

### Weather Bureau

The Tokyo negotiations are scheduled to begin today. The Japanese side's display is getting fiercer and fiercer. The British Empire loves peace and still holds a spirit of compromise to appease the situation, making a fortune in silence - perhaps this is the example of "speak less, do more". Let's see what the next article has to say.

There is one most inexplicable person in the world, and that is Mr. Pius of the Vatican - I don't know which generation he is. Although he is clearly a 'Pope', he insists on engaging in 'politics': but he was kicked out by Old Mo. Now he is helping Old Mo play tricks, is he trying to create a place in history? Why bother? Doesn't God love the weak and small people?

The negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, a winding path leads to a secluded place; where the willows are dark and the flowers are bright, there is another village.

It is said that the Guangzhou Consulate discovered our agents' network. What do the Yamato people, who claim to be born special agent seeds, think?

There are one hundred cases of cholera in this port. In addition to preventing this and preventing that, epidemic prevention seems to be very urgent.

### Tidbits

There was a confused person in Suzhou who, one day, was cleaning out his desk when he found an invitation from last year. He looked at the date on it, which was exactly the current day, and hurriedly ordered the servant to prepare a sedan chair, change clothes, and put on a hat, preparing to go to pay respects. The people in his family explained to him in every possible way, but it was all in vain. He retorted, "Someone has sent an invitation, and it is not right not to go to pay respects." His mother had no choice but to tell the sedan carriers to carry him out of the front door and in through the back door. After a while, he indeed, respectfully, came in from the back door and bowed to his mother, congratulating her again and again. His wife, who was watching from the side, was both angry and amused. After finishing speaking, he left the back door and entered the front door, and saw his wife again, and said, "You are still at home. When I went to pay respects just now, I saw a woman in that house who looked just like you. Fortunately, I was still careful and didn't wrongly ask her questions. Otherwise, I would have mistaken someone, and it would have become a joke, and people would have really said that I was confused."

Previous Summary

In the autumn of 1914, Jack, the radio operator of the Chukes Shipping Company, and Shier, the mechanic, took a German ship to tour Europe. Because England and Germany declared war, British warships were coming to intercept the ship. The ship then began to flee. It barely escaped the tiger's mouth and returned to American territory. Jack and Shier then returned to New York and met with Chukes. Chukes then asked them to take the "St. Mark" to Europe to find his son. On the ship, Jack refused to send a coded telegram for a man named Johnson. It turned out that this fellow was a German spy named Lavicky...

Twelve: Let Him Off Once

The next morning, when Jack and Bill came out, some of the passengers were quite agitated. In the distance at sea, they could see a large ship rapidly approaching from the west. As it drew closer, they could see clearly that it was a large ship with four smokestacks, painted black without any colored trim. The upper half of the hull was yellow, and the lower half was khaki.

There were many speculations and conjectures, but the truth quickly became clear. This was the former "Lusitania," now converted into a warship by the British government during wartime. This was evident from the gun emplacements installed on the fore and aft decks.

As she approached, her dull, somber paint exuded a fierce and stern aura.

"Stop the ship!"

A semaphore signal flew from her bow, and the same order came over the radio.

The "St. Mark" slowed its engines for the second time. Finally, the two large ships faced each other on the undulating sea, gently rocking, as if nodding. The small boat lowered from the "Lusitania" also swayed and wobbled over.

"Now is your chance to denounce old Lavicky," Bill reminded Jack as they leaned against the doorway of the radio room, watching.

"I still feel like this kind of behavior seems very despicable," Jack thought for a moment. "When the 'Lusitania' stopped, I was thinking about it, but—oh well, I think I'll let him off once."

"Perhaps you'll regret it later," Bill said. His words were somewhat prophetic.

The officers from the "Lusitania" didn't conduct a very thorough inspection because the "St. Mark" had already been inspected by the "Berwick." Since the German had already been taken away, all they had to do now was check the ship's papers. It didn't take long. In less than half an hour, the two ships exchanged salutes and separated again.

That afternoon, Mr. Johnson, a distinguished guest, arrived at Jack's radio room. He began the conversation with flattery.

"I'm afraid I was too impetuous yesterday," he said. "I came specifically to apologize."

"That's fine," Jack said dismissively, wanting to dismiss Mr. Johnson's intentions.

"I—uh—perhaps I offered too little," he continued. "Now, I can promise you, if you are willing to send a telegram for me—of course, in code—I can double the amount I offered yesterday."

### Wimbledon Tennis Tournament: Miss Jack Cowper Fails in Semifinals; Men's Doubles Matches Extremely Tense; Our Player Fails in Qualifying Round

The Wimbledon Tennis Tournament featured the women's singles semifinals as the main event yesterday, the 4th. British player Miss Stanmers created a stunning victory, defeating Miss Jack Cowper (USA), who had a very high chance of winning the championship, in straight sets to enter the finals. Miss Stanmers' performance was extremely brilliant, launching a strong offensive with powerful smashes from the start in the first set. The opponent was unable to resist, and the final score was 6-2, 6-2.

Two Beauties Defeat Polish and French Champions

The other two winning players were both from the United States. Miss Mabel defeated Polish champion Miss Jude Soski 6-1, 6-4, and Mrs. Van Pien defeated French champion Mrs. Madieu 6-4, 6-2.

The last match was between Mrs. Sperling (Denmark) and Miss Hardwick (England). Although Miss Hardwick's serves and baseline smashes were both excellent, she was still unable to break through the opponent's strong defense. The first set was 6-4, and the second set was 6-0.

Men's Doubles Tournament: Extremely Tense Situation

In the men's doubles, the match between the Yugoslavian team of Pansek and Mitik and the New Zealand team of Combs and McElflaw was extremely fierce. The entire match lasted two and a half hours, with the Yugoslavian team winning 7-9, 4-6, 6-4, 6-0, 6-4.

One of the most surprising results was the match between Olive Sayers (England) and McNeil and Smith (USA). The American team was expected to win, but the opposite happened. After five consecutive sets of fierce fighting, the British team finally won 6-8, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.

Borotra Team Enters Finals Week

The famous French doubles players Borotra and Brown defeated the British team of Old Collins and Dinkler 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to enter the finals.

McNeil (USA) and Mrs. Stanmers (England) defeated Pansek and Miss Fralin (Yugoslavia) 6-2, 6-2.

Corky and Mrs. Van Pien (USA) defeated Belinton and Miss Ingram (England) 6-2, 6-2.

Keegan and Mrs. Mullan Misto (Belgium) defeated Elmer and Weaver (Luxembourg) 6-2, 6-3.

Qualifying Round Begins: Both He Fail

He Renxuan, our player who was eliminated in the first week, participated in the qualifying round. He had a bye in the first week, and in the second week, he lost to Woodhull of England 5-7, 6-3, 6-4.

In the second week of the women's competition, Miss He Aiying of our country lost to Miss Betty 6-3, 7-5. Miss He made many mistakes in this match. Although she once led 4-2 in the second set, she ultimately failed to maintain her advantage. [Note: This competition is a match between those who were eliminated in the first two weeks of the Wimbledon tournament.]

### "New Gymnastics": Movements and Exercises

— Zou Falu

After reading the article "A Comparative View of New and Old Gymnastics" in this newspaper, most people may have gained some understanding of "New Gymnastics." However, since that article compared "New Gymnastics" with "Old Gymnastics," it only provided a general description of its movements and exercises. Those who have never practiced this type of gymnastics may still have questions about what specific movements and exercises "New Gymnastics" entails. Therefore, this article aims to provide a more detailed explanation.

Before describing the movements and exercises, there are some necessary clarifications:

Although these movements and exercises are based on those of Mr. Wu Zhongou of Zhongda University, they also incorporate some of the author's own opinions, which may differ slightly from Mr. Wu's. However, the differences should not be too significant.

"New Gymnastics" is a fusion of new and old gymnastics movements from Europe and the United States. It embodies principles such as "lively," "dynamic," "high volume," and "high effectiveness." If the movements of "Old Gymnastics" do not contradict these principles, they can be used in "New Gymnastics." This article only describes the movements that differ from Old Gymnastics.

To save space, if the exercises for various movements are similar and can be explained with one example, only one example will be provided. Otherwise, the names of the movements will be listed. Only those that require individual explanation will be explained in detail.

In "New Gymnastics," there must be a position first, then a movement. Unless otherwise specified for lower limb movements, the starting position is usually a semi-open stance.

Muscle regulation is highly valued in New Gymnastics to prevent muscles from becoming stiff and rigid. In most movements, muscle tension must be followed by relaxation. For example, in the "swing" movement, the muscles tense during the swing and relax when the movement reaches a certain point. In the "strike" movement, the muscles tense during the strike and relax upon retraction. The same principle applies to other movements. Some movements, such as "vibration," are too fast and forceful to allow for muscle relaxation during the movement. In such cases, relaxation exercises can be added after completing a section of gymnastics.

This article should be read in conjunction with "A Comparative View of New and Old Gymnastics" for a clearer understanding of the exercises in "New Gymnastics."

Many movements may have been omitted. It is hoped that there will be opportunities to supplement them in the future.

1.  "Swing" Movements: This is one of the most important upper limb movements in New Gymnastics, emphasizing liveliness and naturalness. Each swing should involve a rapid mid-section movement to tense the muscles, followed by a gradual slowdown at a certain point to relax the muscles. The lower limbs can freely flex and extend or rise on the toes following the momentum of the upper limb swing.

(1) Separate Left and Right Swing: The arms separate left and right from a crossed position in front of the body and swing to a certain point before swinging back to the crossed position in front of the body. There is also a "Separate Left and Right Back Swing," which is similar to this movement, except that when swinging back, the arms cross in front of the face, with each hand reaching for the opposite shoulder blade. The arms then swing downward and backward when extending.

(2) Same-Side Left and Right Swing: With both arms raised or one arm raised to the right, the arms swing simultaneously to the right or left. When swinging to the left, the right foot can be lifted onto the toes, and vice versa.

(3) Front and Back Swing: The arms swing forward and backward from a drooping position. The knees can flex and extend once with each swing. There are two variations: simultaneous swing and alternating swing (one forward, one backward).

(4) Separate "Figure-8" Swing: The arms separate from a crossed position in front of the chest, swinging downward, backward, upward, and laterally to cross above the head, then immediately return to the chest, separating and swinging again. Each arm traces a "Figure-8" shape on the front side of the body. Each time the arms cross, the arm in front should be switched.

### Parting Song

— Gu Sifan

One day, two girls moved into the room next to my friend Qi's. The older one was gentle and dignified, and the younger one had bangs and was lively and interesting. They used door panels to make beds and surrounded the beds with sheets to create curtains. A handsome young man with a very elegant demeanor, a friend of theirs, slept on a straw mat on the floor. They were all students from the Zhejiang Youth Wartime Work Corps. The two girls had been sent from the provincial capital to Yuqian County, on the border of Zhejiang. The young man had escorted them there, and after staying for a day or two, he was preparing to go to the Suchang area. He was an intelligence agent for the New Fourth Army in the occupied territories.

They loved to laugh, make noise, and sing, almost without stopping. They made a ruckus one night, but the next morning, they had disappeared to who-knows-where. When we got up, it was quiet as anything outside. We walked past their room and saw the floor covered in straw dust, peanut shells, and a few books scattered around: "Popular Philosophy," "Village in August," "Literary Front." Qi's wife laughed and said:

"What kind of mess is this?"

"A doghouse," I jokingly replied.

Qi seemed to remember something and said:

"The younger one is like Lulu, with the same bangs and liveliness. Just hearing her Hangzhou accent makes me think of Lulu when she was little."

"Why don't I think so?" I said.

"Because you met her in Shanghai when she was already grown up."

Yes, at that time, she was already a teacher to many children. And we only met a few times before parting. It has been almost three years since then. Last autumn, I went from Shanghai to Changsha and passed through Jinhua. I learned that she had gotten married, and I unexpectedly saw a photo of her husband, who was also my friend. Five years ago, when I was studying at a middle school on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai, he was the school's registrar. Later, his relationship with a young female teacher fell apart, and he left the school. No one knew where he had gone.

This spring, I passed through Jinhua again, and friends told me that they had separated soon after getting married. Lulu had joined the New Fourth Army's training camp, and her husband had joined the guerrillas in the south. But now, Lulu was about to graduate, and he had died in an enemy ambush. She wrote a letter to her friends in Jinhua:

"I don't believe it's true. Is it really true? ... Give me the courage to live on:..."

I told Qi about this, and Qi also wrote a letter to comfort her:

"I heard that you are grieving over your misfortune. I feel the need to write to you because I am one of your old friends. Your grief will soon be overcome, just like others who have experienced the same changes. People have both passion and reason. They can be excited and calm. What's more, a great task lies before you!"

But I believe that Lulu will be able to leave her ruined home, wearing a military cotton coat, and wander in unfamiliar places, like Lulu, who is accustomed to being pampered, also able to leave her ruined home and wander in unfamiliar places.

I soon left Yuqian.

On the eve of leaving Yuqian, we drank too much wine. We turned off the lights, but no one could sleep. Qi was very excited, reciting Du Fu's poem: "Tomorrow separated by mountains, the affairs of the world are both vast and hazy."

"When will you come again?" Qi's wife asked.

"If the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway isn't cut off, I'll be back in half a year," I replied.

"Don't believe him!" Qi shouted wildly: "Guangxi is three thousand miles away from here! And even if he comes, will we still be in Yuqian? By then, we will have long since gone to who-knows-where!"

No one spoke anymore. Outside the window, the valley was bathed in melancholy moonlight.

Outside, they were making noise again. The two girls were laughing, and the young man was shouting, "My eldest daughter! My youngest daughter!"

Qi's wife couldn't help but laugh and say:

"Listen to them! What a 'precious father'!"

As the laughter subsided, they began to sing the tragic "Parting Song." The last two lines:

Goodbye, goodbye, classmates!

We'll meet again on the front lines!

It was easy to bring tears to one's eyes.

The next morning, it was quiet outside again, but when we walked past that house, the situation was completely different: the floor was swept clean, and the straw mat was gone. He was gone.

### A Bundle of Wild Grass

— Liu Lan

Overture

Loneliness teaches people to ponder, solitude makes people imagine more. In the deep of night, listening to the ticking of the clock, I casually jot down these fragmented thoughts.

Time

First, I thought of time. What a difficult thing to grasp! (Where does it come from, and where does it go?) A champion of aestheticism said: "Time robs you of the roses of your youth." Others said, "Don't go to clock shops, hear your youth being gnawed away." Thus, people tremble with fear in the face of time, worrying that rosy cheeks will turn into white hair.

"How many possibilities are there in a second?" Who knows? I don't seek a mystical answer, like some kind of hidden hand pulling the strings of fate. Friends, be careful, you will see the changes that time brings to people. There are too many.

The children we remember have already learned about love; the lively people have already walked into the grave. Look at our motherland! How is she surpassing time in this race against time and progressing rapidly?

That's right. This is exactly what I wanted to say. Don't be afraid, and don't tremble even more. Seize it, and complete the work we should do.

Happiness

"Happiness is sometimes very close to people, so close that it can be touched with a reach, but people still lose it." I can't forget this sentence for a long time. Happiness often wanders in the wilderness, unable to find a patron.

I also often remember the embarrassed faces of those being teased in the midst of loud laughter. People are accustomed to building their own happiness on the suffering of others, saying that they have found happiness. But alas, the answer is negative.

Happiness is not selfish. In this turbulent era, there is no personal happiness, everything is attached to the nation. Abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the trivial, working for one's own benefit will not succeed.

Happiness will fall upon the children of the motherland.

### Camp Song

— Jin Xi

…Dedicated to Old Wang…

In the silent and lonely night,

No footsteps of passersby are heard;

The solemn bugle call

Accompanies the long howl of the west wind.

The moonlight shines like cold frost,

Scattered over the watchtower's camp.

Amidst the clashing of iron helmets,

Many people shout:

"Let us rise,

And drive away our enemies!"

### Surrendering to the Motherland

— Jin Yi

—The Story of a Girl—

People all stood up, collecting their belongings. They originally didn't have much, so they leaned out of the window, looking to see if anyone had come to welcome them. Sure enough, in the crowded mass of people, they saw a white flag that read, “Welcome Comrades ××.” They quickly waved toward that direction, as if the people over there had also seen them and were squeezing over toward them. Just at that moment, a strange whistle sounded. Immediately, people seemed to be completely overturned. Women screamed in shrill voices, children were pushed and cried, and the white flag disappeared. The crowd was like mad creatures, rushing, colliding, without order or reason. Some people were pushed down below the platform, and even the railway police maintaining order ran away in panic.

They were simply stunned. It was still that young man, who happened not to have gone down either, who told them that this was an air raid alert and led them down from the back of the train.

“We can't wait here. The station is the target. Let's run away quickly.”

He jumped down first, and Jingwen followed. As she jumped, the train moved, and she fell to the ground. But she quickly got up and ran toward the outside of the tracks.

The train was pulled away by the frantic locomotive, leaving behind the entire frantic platform. Everyone rushed toward the exit, all crammed at the gate. The station worker waved a red flag and blew a copper whistle, but it was of no use. Some in the crowd saw them howling and running over, and immediately, many people followed, running toward the fields.

Before they had run far, the siren suddenly sounded again. It was different from before, short and rapid, as if gasping for breath. The young man then said to them:

“We can’t run too far anymore. Everyone scatter and lie on the ground.”

Qingyan listened to his words, ran another seven or eight steps, and lay down on the ground; but the young man instructed as if giving an order:

“Not like that. Lie on your back, with both hands flat under your head.” (To be continued)

### Burning Red-banded Snake

— Ming Zhi

—The Story of the Old Grandmother—

Due to Qian Asen's notification, the threshing ground suddenly became busy. Qian Asen said that Li Jingen had told him last night that "they" would be passing through this place today on a rural "search."

Wang Mingyuan, leading us, was helping in the old grandmother's threshing. Upon hearing the news, he gathered us to discuss countermeasures. Because "they" were numerous, eighty or ninety people, we decided, according to custom, not to confront "them" head-on, but to temporarily scatter to the Qin Mountains behind.

"Okay," the old grandmother said, wiping the sweat from her forehead, "You go. I'll take care of everything here. When they come and go, you can come down the mountain and return."

"How will we know when 'they' come and go?" asked Captain Wang.

"Just watch for smoke rising from the threshing ground; that means 'they' have come. When the smoke stops, that means 'they' have gone." She then said to her son and daughter-in-law, "You go too. It's enough for A Ming to stay with me." A Ming was her grandson.

While Captain Wang was supervising us to pack up in the house, the old grandmother's family and Qian Asen were all gathering the wheat stalks and broken wheat straw on the threshing ground and piling them up in the southwest corner of the ground.

We went up the mountain, Qian Asen also returned to Qingzhen, and only the old grandmother and A Ming were left on the threshing ground.

We set up sentries at the foot of the mountain, and most of the people hid in the woods on the mountainside. Everyone readied their weapons, preparing for "them" to rush up.

Li Jingen, not far from leaving Wangjia Village, ran into "them" and was questioned, searched, and beaten by "them," but fortunately, nothing else happened.

The old grandmother saw "them" gradually entering the village and went to light the pile of wheat husks, letting it burn.

It seemed that someone among "them" was issuing orders, that for this small village, they should also fulfill "their" responsibility for going to the countryside. So a small group of people entered the houses to "search," and most of the people sat down under the trees to rest.

"Hey, old woman," one of "them," wearing a white cloth shirt and pants, called out to the old grandmother, "Come here, I want to ask you something."

The old grandmother, dragging a willow flail in her hand, walked over. A Ming followed behind her. They both looked calm. Even though someone had entered their house, they didn't seem to pay any attention.

"What is it?" The old grandmother wiped her sweat with the corner of her clothes.

"Do you have a guerrilla team here?"

"'Oil and beans' every family fries."

"It's not about 'beans.' I'm asking if you have any 'bandits' here."

"There have never been local bandits here, only robbers from outside."

"Where are the robbers?"

"They don't live here; they come and go."

"What do they rob?"

"Whatever they see, even people."

She talked nonsense with that person for a while. Seeing that nothing was happening, she went back to threshing wheat.

The people who had entered the house to "search" did not come out, and more people followed them in. The person wearing white cloth pants seemed a bit bored, so he stood up and looked around. He caught sight of the burning pile of wheat husks and called out to the grandmother again, saying:

"Hey, old woman, come here, I still want to ask you something."

The old grandmother pretended not to hear and ignored him.

"Hey, old woman, what are you burning there?" He walked over, looking somewhat amiable.

The old grandmother said casually, "Burning red-banded snakes there!"

"Red-banded snakes? Where did the red-banded snakes come from?" He clearly wanted to find something to talk about.

"I don't know where the red-banded snakes came from!" The old grandmother rested the flail and said. "But they're definitely not from around here, because we've never had them here, only recently found them."

"How big are they?" He, like most people, was very fond of talking about snakes.

"How could they not be big? The big ones are like arms, the small ones like fingers."

"How many are there?"

"How could there not be many? Sometimes dozens, sometimes one or two, they often appear. It's said that in some places, they're found in the thousands!"

"Has anyone been bitten to death?"

### Emergency Blackout Drill Scheduled for the End of the Month, Time to Be Determined. Chiang Kai-shek Publicly Demonstrates Methods for Extinguishing Incendiary Bombs. Locally Made Gas Masks Still Awaiting Testing.

The Air Defense Authority, in the past, to test residents' understanding of air defense and whether they can effectively comply with the regulations, has held several blackout drills. However, the results have been declining. For this reason, the authorities had intended to continue holding an emergency blackout drill last month, but it was temporarily suspended due to circumstances. According to sources, this emergency blackout drill has now been scheduled for the end of this month, and the date has been chosen. However, the date will not be announced beforehand to allow residents to prepare in advance. It is hoped that all air defense equipment, such as air raid shelter light bulbs and lampshades, etc., will be prepared in advance so that they can be mobilized immediately after the alarm is issued, and not be arranged temporarily, which would affect the results. Air Defense Commissioner Shi Xiangjian also stated that a batch of incendiary bombs will be shipped from England to Hong Kong for experimentation. In the future, instructions will be given to the public in various parts of Hong Kong on how to extinguish them so that they will not be at a loss when dealing with them in the future. According to Commissioner Shi's opinion, residents should not leave their homes lightly during air raids. Even if it is considered necessary to leave, someone should be left to guard the house, as it is feared that incendiary bombs will enter the room and, if not rescued in time, will cause a prairie fire. Regarding the issue of locally made gas masks, Commissioner Shi stated that although masks are manufactured in Hong Kong, none have been provided to the government for testing. The Hong Kong government is eager to promote this industry and has notified several factories to submit samples of filters to the government for testing. If they are deemed satisfactory, the government will purchase them.

### "July 7th" Expanded Bond Purchase Campaign Week. From Today to the 13th. The National Salvation Bond Branch Urges Overseas Chinese to Actively Purchase Bonds.

The Hong Kong Branch of the National Salvation Bond Campaign Committee held a regular meeting yesterday and resolved to take advantage of the "July 7th" anniversary to promote the active purchase of bonds by various overseas Chinese groups so that the 10 million yuan bond quota can be fully subscribed as soon as possible. This shows our overseas Chinese compatriots' love for the motherland and their faith in supporting the war of resistance. Yesterday, a letter was also issued to all overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, urging them to make efforts to subscribe. The original letter said, "Commemorating July 7th, please purchase bonds." From the smoke of gunfire, an independent, free, dignified, and brilliant New China will surely be created. This is the greatness of July 7th, and it is worth the solemn commemoration of compatriots across the country. Now, as the second anniversary of July 7th approaches, all our Hong Kong compatriots are enthusiastically commemorating it, either by selling flowers, selling flags, eating vegetarian food, or saving money, making various meaningful expressions, which fully demonstrate the patriotic enthusiasm of our overseas Chinese compatriots, which is admirable. However, in order for our national government to concentrate its financial resources to make overall plans as originally planned, a "July 7th Expanded Bond Purchase Campaign Week" is specially scheduled from the 6th to the 13th of this month. Fellow overseas Chinese compatriots are invited to actively purchase bonds during the two weeks so that the amount of 10 million yuan can be fully subscribed as soon as possible. The sawmills and merchants have already subscribed for 10,000 yuan, and the Inn Industry United Chamber of Commerce and the Butchers' Guild Shouyi Hall have each subscribed for 50 yuan, taking the lead in practice. It is believed that other organizations and fellow overseas Chinese compatriots will not give way and will act bravely, and will surely follow suit and not allow others to monopolize the beauty of being first. Respectfully, the Hong Kong Branch of the National Salvation Public Bond Raising Committee, Director Zheng Chiru, Deputy Director Li Xingqu, July 5th.

### A Murder for Money Occurred in Tai Hang, Hong Kong Yesterday Morning. He Qiong, a Wealthy Widow Who Returned from Overseas, Was Found Strangled in Her Building.

At 1 Chong Shek Road, Tai Hang Village, Causeway Bay, on the second floor, a 60-year-old woman named He Yinggui, also known as He Qiong and He Qigu, a native of Shunde, born in San Francisco, USA, was murdered in her home late last night. It was not until 9:30 a.m. yesterday morning that a water carrier discovered her, seeing Ms. He lying on the floor with a coolie's towel-like object around her neck, her hands tied behind her back with a towel, and her feet tied with a black belt. The deceased was wearing black cloth pants and a gray cloth vest, with a pink woman's shirt on her left shoulder. Her mouth was also tightly stuffed with cloth. When she was discovered, the deceased's body was already cold and had been dead for a long time. After the water carrier discovered her, she went to the police station to report the case. After receiving the report, the police station sent detectives to the scene to investigate. The deceased's body was immediately taken to the mortuary for an autopsy in a hearse.

Living Alone, Renting the Entire Building

According to the investigation, the deceased lived alone on the second floor of 1 Chong Shek Road. She moved in four years ago, renting the entire floor for 20 yuan a month. Ms. He only lived alone and had no relatives living with her. Occasionally, relatives and friends from Macau would visit, but they would come and go quickly and rarely stay for long. The deceased's residence was very simple. The furnishings upstairs were also very simple. Besides an iron bed and a five-bucket cabinet, there was nothing else. All the clothes, bedding, and all daily necessities were piled up on the bed. The deceased usually took care of all the household chores herself. Because the building had no water pipe equipment, water was supplied by a Hakka woman who carried it up every morning between 8:30 and 9:00. Yesterday morning, the case was discovered by the water carrier.

Sparkling Gold Jewelry, Tempting People

The deceased was wealthy and had many properties in Cheung Chau, New Territories. She also had a large amount of money deposited in the Bank of East Asia. She usually wore sparkling gold jewelry when she went out, and when she bought things, she always used silver dollars or 50 yuan banknotes for change. Perhaps this was why she was coveted by bandits. When the detectives went upstairs to investigate after the deceased was killed, they found that the five-bucket cabinet had been searched in an abnormally messy manner. According to the deceased's godson, Guan Quan, who reported to the police, the deceased had a lot of cash stored in the house in addition to the property she had purchased and the money she had deposited in the bank, as well as gold bars and other jewelry. However, when the police searched, the above-mentioned gold jewelry and money were gone. It is heard that the deceased married a local overseas Chinese as a concubine in the Americas many years ago and returned to Hong Kong to live together, bringing with her more than 70,000 yuan, so her life was quite prosperous. The deceased's first wife and her children and grandchildren lived in the countryside and rarely came to Hong Kong. The deceased also had an older brother who ran a chicken and duck stall at a certain number in the upper district, which was quite large. The deceased had purchased insurance worth more than 100,000 yuan from a certain life insurance company in Hong Kong.

Police Investigation, Suspected Murder

The deceased was a gambler and especially liked mahjong. She usually returned home late at night, often between 11 p.m., and sometimes even invited her friends back home to chat until 1 or 2 a.m. It was seen that the deceased was alone in a restaurant nearby around 10 p.m. After leaving the restaurant, her whereabouts were unknown. Therefore, it is believed that when the woman returned home, it was late at night, and she was followed by bandits who sneaked into the building and committed the crime. Currently, the police authorities, in view of the seriousness of the case, have stepped up their investigation. It is heard that after the Liao case occurred, a woman went to see the deceased, claiming to be her sister. The police have summoned her to the police station for questioning. It is generally speculated that the case is a murder for money. The perpetrator coveted the deceased's wealth and therefore committed the crime.

### Continued Trial of the Murder Case in Li Yuan East Street. Tan Song Testifies on the Arrest of the Bandit. Held for Third Trial at 3 PM Today.

The suspect in the robbery and murder case in Li Yuan East Street, Liu Wenzhu, continued to be interrogated by Central Magistrate Yi Huashi yesterday afternoon. First, Tan Song, the Chinese detective No. 623, who bravely captured the defendant on the day of the incident, testified. He said that at about 11:30 a.m. on the same day, he and Chinese detective Yin Wen No. 612 were patrolling near No. 27 Li Yuan East Street when they suddenly heard a gunshot. They then saw three men, two wearing suits and one wearing Chinese clothing, walking towards Des Voeux Road. The defendant was one of them. He signaled Yin to chase after them. Yin heard the signal and pursued the man in Chinese clothing, while he approached the defendant. In an instant, he suddenly heard a loud bang. He looked to the left and saw Yin Wen covering his abdomen and slowly falling down. At that time, the defendant and the other person had passed him. Seeing this, he stepped onto the sidewalk in front of No. 5, only four shops away from the defendant and the other person. He then fired at them, chasing them for more than half a street when he fired another shot. At the intersection of Li Yuan East Street and Des Voeux Road, the person in the blue clothes fired several shots at him. He then fired a third shot. At this time, the defendant and the other person turned to the left and ran along the arcade of Des Voeux Road. He followed closely behind them and fired two more shots when they reached the intersection of Pottinger Street, and sounded the whistle to call for reinforcements. The person in the blue clothes also fell to the ground in response. He then abandoned him and pursued the defendant alone, firing the last bullet. When he reached the intersection of China Street, he crossed the tram tracks and fled towards Victoria Street. When he reached No. 77, he was blocked by a rickshaw. He then turned towards the stone pillar. At that time, he had caught up and hit him on the head with his gun, grabbing his collar. He looked back and saw him, and immediately put his hand into his pocket. He then gripped his hand tightly. At this time, a policeman and an Indian policeman had arrived one after another and helped to subdue the defendant. He was still struggling hard. He then hit him on the forehead with his gun, and he fell to the ground. The Indian policeman then picked up a gun from the ground, which contained five bullets. After the British officer who tested the weapons finished testifying, the judge ordered that the trial be continued this afternoon.

### "China Salvation" About to Leave the Country. Last Performance Before Departure. In Response to the Enthusiastic Invitation of All Circles in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Reception Performance for Three Days Starting Tonight.

(Special report from this newspaper) The China Salvation Drama Troupe is about to leave the country for propaganda work. In response to the special invitation of the Women's War Disaster Relief Association, they held the 746th large-scale charity performance at the Lee Theatre from the 1st to the 3rd to raise funds for the association to relieve wounded soldiers and refugees. The performance of the great famous dramas "By the Yongding River" and "The Earth's Calamity" was a complete success. This charity performance was originally the troupe's last charity performance before leaving the country. However, due to fundraising reasons, the ticket prices were not popularized to the public and the number of seats was limited, and many people were unable to attend. Therefore, during the charity performance, they received letters and telegrams from various community organizations and schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon, requesting that they continue to hold reception performances to promote publicity. The troupe, feeling that it was difficult to refuse with enthusiasm, and due to the ship schedule, still had several days to stay in Hong Kong, so it was specifically scheduled to continue the 747th reception performance for three consecutive days at the Lee Theatre, with the great famous drama "The Light of Southern Shandong" performed at the night show tonight, "By the Yongding River" performed at the day and night shows tomorrow "July 7th", and "The Light of Southern Shandong" performed at the day and night shows on the 8th. The ticket prices are only set at three kinds of one dime, two dimes, and four dimes, in order to popularize it. After this public performance, they will leave for the Philippines and then the United States. Overseas Chinese compatriots who want to appreciate the highest level of dramatic art at the current stage should seize this last opportunity to reserve seats as soon as possible.

### A Street Fight Occurred in Wellington Street Last Night. More Than a Dozen Men Held Sharp Weapons. Six People Injured After a Long Fight.

At about 9 o'clock last night, at the intersection of Wellington Street and Pottinger Street, more than a dozen men suddenly had a conflict for unknown reasons. The two sides fought each other and drew sharp weapons as weapons. The momentum was fierce, and the crowd was noisy for a while, and the order was disrupted. Pedestrians fled in all directions, and some shops closed their doors for fear of being vandalized. The dozen or so men were entangled in front of the Fu An Factory at No. 45 on the street for a long time. Because both sides had weapons, several people were injured before long. Two of them fell to the ground, blood gushing out of their faces and staining the ground. Some passers-by nearby saw that the situation was not good and sounded the whistle to report to the police. At that time, the reserve policemen No. 30 and No. 100 who were on duty at the post heard the police and immediately telegraphed the police station to report. After receiving the report, the Central Police Station sent a large number of detectives led by the Chinese and Western inspectors to the scene to suppress the situation. When the detectives arrived, they heard that the fighters had fled in all directions, and only six injured people were lying in blood. Among them, two were seriously injured and fell in front of the Fu An Shoe Factory. Their abdomens and limbs were all cut by knives, and they were unconscious. After the detectives arrived, they first took care of the injured and searched the streets for the rest of the gang. The detectives then summoned the ambulance to the scene and first sent the injured to the Marie Hospital for treatment. A short knife sheath was found at the scene, which was probably left by the criminals. After the six injured people were sent to the hospital, two of them were unable to testify due to their unconscious state. The other four spoke with a Northern River accent and resembled stable boys. As of 12 o'clock last night, the police were still investigating. More than a dozen men from Shanghai and Shandong near D'Aguilar Street were taken to the police station for questioning.

### Seventh-Seventh Anniversary Meeting Distributes 250,000 Flowers

### Rumor: National Currency Price Has Recovered to County Standards, Legal Exchange Rate Set at Seven Pence, Trade Export Exchange Settlement Control to Be Implemented Soon

The legal tender of our country was originally set at a standard exchange rate of 14.25 pence per yuan, equivalent to slightly more than 9.5 dimes in Hong Kong dollars. However, with the outbreak of war, the number of excess imports increased significantly, leading to the emergence of a black market and a decline in the value of the legal tender. To balance foreign exchange, our financial authorities continued to calculate foreign exchange purchases for merchants at the legal exchange rate, resulting in a significant monthly burden, with speculators benefiting the most. Moreover, the × people issued counterfeit currency in the occupied areas to absorb legal tender and transport it to Shanghai, thereby acquiring our country's foreign exchange. Although × country's business community suffered first, even restricting its exports to China in North China, because our country's merchants were unwilling to use counterfeit currency, and immediately exchanged it for goods once received, our country's financial system was inevitably affected. To counter their acquisition of foreign exchange, the Bank of China stopped listing rates last month, temporarily suspending acceptance of merchants' foreign exchange applications, with the exception of necessary expenditures related to the current situation. In other words, the legal exchange rate of 14.25 pence was abolished. At the beginning of its implementation, the legal tender market saw considerable fluctuations, and × even spread rumors that our reserve fund was exhausted. However, knowledgeable people knew that our country had sufficient funds and solid credit. Nevertheless, to cope with the × people's acquisition of foreign exchange, this move was necessary. As expected, it soon stabilized and even rose sharply several times. Conversely, the price of the × started to follow the legal tender. Financial circles expected the financial authorities to find a suitable level in the market and re-establish the legal exchange rate for the national currency. Yesterday, it was heard that friendly countries had decided to continue their support for our financial problems as agreed, with no intention of changing. At the same time, we also decided to control export prices and prohibit the import of non-essential goods to strengthen our war resistance financial resources, with perfect measures in place. Therefore, the re-establishment of the legal rate, with each yuan equivalent to seven pence in British currency, is particularly urgent to implement the "export exchange settlement" method. Yesterday, the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China resumed listing rates, announcing the legal tender exchange rate as above. Merchants can apply to the Bank of China to purchase foreign exchange at this rate, and foreign exchange obtained by export merchants must also be sold to the government in accordance with the exchange settlement method. However, this news has not yet been confirmed by the Bank of China. Last night, the legal tender market rate fluctuated to 5.29 Hong Kong dollars, which is also equivalent to 6.5 to 6.25 pence in British currency, still slightly lower than the legal exchange rate.

### Current Epidemic

According to the Medical Department's report, in the past 24 hours, 15 cases of cholera, 39 cases of tuberculosis, 6 cases of dysentery, 3 cases of typhoid fever, 2 cases of meningococcal meningitis, and 1 case of measles were discovered in Hong Kong.

### Refugee Camp Population Decreases Again

According to official reports, in the week before July 1st, the population of government refugee camps was as follows: (King's Park) 1,430, (Ma Tau Chung) 1,021, (North Point) 1,593, (Lai Chi Kok Hospital) 1 soldier, (Kam Tin) 4,010, (Ma Tau Chung) 763 soldiers, (San Uk Ling) 883, totaling 9,701 people, a decrease of 154 people from the previous week, including a decrease of 24 soldiers.

### A Tour of Fudan Middle School

— Xia

Yesterday, the Hong Kong branch of Fudan Middle School held a graduation ceremony for senior and junior high school students and an achievement exhibition at the school. The reporter took this opportunity to run to Fudan Middle School, which had escaped from the clutches of the × people and reopened in Fanling, for a tour.

A little more than an hour's drive took people from the bustling city to the countryside, to Fanling. After getting off the car, walking along the Pak Chi Road, flanked by rice paddies, the rice fields in July, laden with heavy grains, were a tender yellow. Green trees and wildflowers intertwined to form a natural beauty. Not far away, one could see the majestic figure of Fudan Middle School standing beside it.

Outside the school gate, a bright and magnificent national flag was raised high, fluttering in the wind. This perfectly complemented the joy in the hearts of the students in the school. After gathering and singing the national anthem, the graduation ceremony began. The principal earnestly exhorted the graduating students, followed by congratulatory speeches from the representatives of the senior and junior second grades, and finally a reply from the graduates. In the evening, there was also a entertainment program, with a performance of the play "Process" to add to the fun and welcome the guests.

Before the exhibition opened, the reporter inspected the crystallization of the students' hard work. The small room with a long area had walls neatly lined with students' history and geography achievements. The library, the animal and plant specimen room, the physics and chemistry instrument room, and the anatomy room were all arranged with very rich equipment. Many of these instruments were bought from the United States by Mr. Li Taichu and rescued from Guangzhou.

In the school's pavilion, the reporter talked with the person in charge of the school about their painstaking management. The beauty of the school's environment and the various facilities really make it a very perfect middle school.

Ninety-nine percent of the students there are boarders. The fees charged are only HK$110 per semester for senior high school boys and girls, and HK$100 per semester for junior high school boys and girls. These fees are not considered expensive compared to the original schools in Hong Kong.

In addition to working hard on the textbooks, the students in the school are even more active in extra-curricular research. There are now journalism research societies, speech research societies, morning art research societies, history and geography research societies, history, geography, and chemistry research societies, physics and chemistry research societies, and physical education and national arts research societies, so that they can develop their research spirit in their own way.

In addition, in order to enrich the summer life, the school has specially organized a summer reading club. In addition to the guidance of all the teachers of the school, academic celebrities are invited to the school to give lectures. Students from other schools who join the reading club, in addition to food and accommodation (food costs $7 per month, accommodation costs $2), only pay a small membership fee of $2. Activities are divided by week and include English literature, social sciences, dramatic arts, and academic trips, and the program is very rich.

### Ministry of Finance Orders Four Banks to Provide Legal Tender as Much as Possible, Increased Chips Will Eliminate Premium, Check Exchange Will Be Centrally Handled

Since the banking and finance industry association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting that it provide legal tender to the industry as much as possible, it has been approved by the ministry and ordered the four banks to comply. The number of chips in the market has increased, and the financial situation will become more stable in the future. The transfer premium will be cancelled, and the exchange of checks in the silver industry will also be handled centrally. The details are as follows:

Check Exchange to Be Handled Centrally

In addition to handling the exchange of checks for member banks, the Bankers' Check Exchange also collects checks from other financial institutions and the financial industry. The financial industry's check exchange specializes in handling the exchange of checks for member financial banks. The two exchanges have been quite effective since their establishment. According to the reporter of Xin Sheng She's inquiry with the banking and finance industry, it has now been decided by the two industries after consultation that the check exchange of the banking and finance industry will be handled centrally starting on July 4, 1939.

Ministry of Finance Agrees to Provide Legal Tender to the Industry

The Ministry of Finance has agreed to the request of the banking and finance industry association to provide legal tender to the industry and has ordered the four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China to comply. In addition, the payment of wages to various industries will not be subject to the Ma telegram's restrictions, but an application form must be filled out and approved by the joint office of the four banks. In addition, the transfer of deposits to the interior, or the transfer of deposits to banks in the interior, and the use for the development of real industries, will also not be restricted. This is the government's encouragement of the transfer of funds to the interior and the development of agriculture, industry, and mining in the interior, so as to avoid excessive funds in Shanghai for improper speculative transactions.

Transfer Premium Will Be Eliminated

Regarding the implementation of the transfer check system, an improper transfer premium has been created. Although the Ministry of Finance has ordered the prohibition of this practice, general money exchange banks have violated the ministry's order and arbitrarily charged a premium. Fortunately, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee, entrusted by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, has maintained the premium at about 50 yuan per thousand. Now that the four measures to stabilize the market have been implemented, the number of legal tender chips has increased, and the Bank Reserve Committee has stopped maintaining the transfer premium. It is expected that the transfer premium will be eliminated by itself in the future. At the same time, it is hoped that the Money Exchange Industry Association will advise member money exchange banks to stop the improper transfer premium business.

Foreign Banks Are Not Bound

Regarding the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram restricting deposit withdrawals, foreign banks are not bound. As a result, some people are deeply concerned that funds will flow into foreign banks, but according to the reporter of Xin Sheng She's inquiry with the banking and finance industry yesterday, foreign banks do not have transfer deposit accounts, and all are in cash. However, the interest rate is lower than that of Chinese banks and financial banks. Most of the deposits are from foreigners living in Shanghai and foreign companies operated by foreigners, while there are very few Chinese deposits. As for Chinese banks, their credit is well-known, so there is no concern that funds will flow into foreign banks.

Four Banks Try Their Best to Regulate Finance

The Loan Committee of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China has been effective in regulating interbank finance and handling loan business. Member banks of the banking and finance industry association who wish to apply to the committee for loans must be transferred through the two industry reserve banks, directly regulating interbank finance and indirectly helping all industries. It is heard that as of the end of May, the outstanding balance of loans was still more than 14 million yuan. The discount rate of the committee has always been 7.5%, and the loan interest rate has always been 25%, which has not fluctuated due to market stability.

### Shanghai's Radio Stations

— David

At present, the number of radio stations in Shanghai has opened a new era that has never been seen before, but most of them were established after the unannounced dissolution of the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications after the retreat of the National Army to the west. There are more than 20 stations. In the past, broadcasting special programs on the radio could arouse the interest of millions of listeners. Now, in addition to charity programs, Hakka broadcasts are often only broadcast once every four or five days. The programs broadcast are nothing more than comic Shanghai opera and storytelling, etc. I am afraid that after a long time, listeners will want to abandon it. The so-called special programs must of course be special. Now broadcasting back and forth is the old tune, which cannot be called special.

The broadcast of special programs on radio stations often causes losses to the Hakka people who broadcast fixed programs, but there are also a few radio stations that are willing to make up for the days for the Hakka people, but this is also a minority. Therefore, Hakka people would rather pay more expensive radio fees and not broadcast programs on radio stations that broadcast special programs. There is a reason for this.

Most of the radio stations that broadcast special programs were established after the August 13th Incident. In addition to charity special programs to appeal for refugees, the remaining old radio stations sometimes have one or two commercial public broadcasts. The East China Radio will not broadcast special programs except for charity programs, so it is very popular with fixed customers and discerning listeners. The Guohua Radio has more special programs and other listeners.

In the early days of Shanghai's radio stations, except for three or four Western radio stations, they were entirely operated by Chinese merchants. After the retreat of the National Army to the west, several famous Chinese radio stations had to temporarily transfer to foreign merchants, that is, East China, the Mainland, and the East. The three companies were unwilling to lose their business and transferred management to British merchants. The Shanghai Fuxing Two Radio Stations have voluntarily closed down, and the remaining newly established radio stations will not be mentioned here. As for advertising, the business of several old radio stations is of course not a problem, because Hakka people would rather pay more expensive radio fees to broadcast in the warehouse in order to have a large audience. Several new radio stations have cheaper prices, and customers are also unwilling to pay higher radio fees. It is not uncommon for them to slightly pay for radio fees to broadcast programs because of difficult emotions. As far as I know, the highest radio fee is East China, but old radio stations such as the Mainland, East, and Guohua are not cheap either. The best performing radio stations are the Mainland, East China, and Guohua, etc. They can be received in many places outside the city, and they are extremely clear in the local city. In particular, East China can broadcast to Beiping and Chongqing. Storyteller Yan Xueting often receives letters from the audience in Beiping on the station, requesting to sing opening verses. This is really commendable.

### Waterloo Prison – Overcrowding

— Birmingham

More than at any time in history – A prisoner deliberately commits a crime to enter prison to quit smoking

Waterloo Prison—the world's largest prison—has broken another record. The total number of prisoners inside is no less than 7,377, more than at any time in its history. For the past five years, the prison's population has not exceeded 7,000. During wartime, the total number indeed decreased to 4,674. However, in the past few months, the number of prisoners has surged, reaching the 7,000 mark again just a few days ago, and it seems the trend of increase continues.

Waterloo Prison is well-known and densely populated. A small number of prisoners commit minor crimes in order to stay inside for a few weeks. Last week, there was a case where a prisoner admitted he deliberately entered prison. It turned out this person was addicted to opium and was suffering from the pain of wanting to quit but being unable to. His friends told him to commit some petty crimes and get imprisoned in Waterloo Prison, guaranteeing he could definitely quit his addiction. Therefore, this person stole some things and was sentenced to three months in prison. He is now quitting smoking. According to prison officials, he can quit his addiction.

In January 1932, Waterloo Prison had 6,745 prisoners, all Chinese. Foreign prisoners were not included, because they were in the Xiamen Road Prison. But within a few months, Waterloo Prison reached its highest ever prisoner population of 7,251. Although there were many fluctuations afterward, the number decreased as some were pardoned or conditionally released. As time passed, the war came in 1937. During wartime, many prisoners were released. Originally, more prisoners were to be released, but this plan was stopped. Shells hit the prison, killing several prisoners. Fewer prisoners were brought in, so the population plummeted to 4,674. This was in October, when the war was about to move away from the Shanghai area.

Then, the number began to gradually increase again, but according to the figures, it would not reach the previous high level again. Since 1932, the prison has been expanded, adding a foreign prisoner section, replacing the Western prison on Xiamen Road. The current number of Chinese prisoners is 7,140, which is less than the previous highest record, but when combined with the 111 foreign prisoners and the 126 inmates in the reformatory, the total is 7,377, which is the highest prisoner record in the prison's history.

This situation was not expected. At the beginning of this year, there were a total of 6,312 Chinese in the prison. The prison authorities estimated, based on the possible increase in crime, that the number of prisoners this year would not exceed 7,000. But it is now known that the estimate was wrong, because the increase in crime (as seen in the Shanghai Municipal Council's police and litigation reports) resulted in the number of prisoners in the prison exceeding the actual number. Since March of this year, it has continued to increase without interruption, only when prisoners are released every week, and no new ones are brought in, does the number decrease slightly.

The current total number of prisoners includes 25 prisoners who have been sentenced to death and are waiting for execution, 79 with life sentences, 200 with sentences of 15 years or more, 563 with sentences of 10 years or more, 902 with sentences of 7 years or more, 761 with sentences of 5 years or more, 682 with sentences of 3 years or more, 524 with sentences of 2 years or more, 886 with sentences of 1 year or more, 1,207 with sentences of 6 months or more, 828 with sentences of 3 months or more, 167 with sentences of 2 months or more, 146 with sentences of 1 month or more, 169 with sentences of 7 days or more, and there is also one prisoner whose case has not been decided.

### Domestic Sales of Woolen Fabrics

Shanghai is undoubtedly a commercial center in our country. Whether it is export or import, most of it passes through here. Large quantities of our domestic raw materials and goods are transported to foreign countries, or large quantities of goods are ordered from foreign countries and then transported to other commercial ports in the country. Therefore, it is correct to say that Shanghai's commerce is the hub of our national industry and commerce.

The woolen fabric industry in Shanghai should naturally be regarded as the hub of the national woolen fabric industry. This can be proven by looking at the sales situation of the Shanghai woolen fabric industry in recent decades. In the past, most woolen fabric firms not only supplied the needs of consumers in the city, but also regulated the demand of many other commercial ports in the country. Therefore, in the annual sales figures of many woolen fabric firms, transactions in other ports accounted for half of the total, and this proportion has even exceeded when transportation was convenient. The sales areas in North China included Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, Yantai, Jinan, etc. Before the September 18th Incident, Liaoning, such as Shenyang, Yingkou, and other places, also had sales. In Central China and South China, the area was even wider, such as Hankou, Changsha, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Guilin, Nanchang, Guangzhou, Shantou, and other places. Transactions were busy every year. Places such as Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, and Hankou had particularly large annual sales. The January 28th Incident gave a great blow to sales in other ports. At that time, it was not only the woolen fabric industry, but other industries such as hardware and cotton yarn also encountered the same situation. However, because the war ended soon, the woolen fabric industry and other industries generally resumed sales in other ports not long after, and the situation did not decline much.

But finally, the August 13th Incident, the full-scale war of resistance, suddenly broke out in Shanghai. At that time, the woolen fabric industry was in the winter business season. Although Pingjin was already in a tense state, customers from Qinghan were coming to allocate goods one after another. At this point, they had to temporarily suspend purchases. As the war intensified, in early September, the woolen fabric industry, even local sales, fell into stagnation. Many employees also returned to their hometowns to avoid the war. By early December, when the national army withdrew from Shanghai, the woolen fabric industry and other businesses generally began to operate. At this time, the sales of other ports were cut off, and many places were in ruins, and transportation was not possible. Local sales were also very bleak. During this period, the woolen fabric industry can only be said to be maintaining the store, and everyone was sorting out their business after the shock subsided.

In the following year, the Jinpu Railway mail delivery in Pingjin and other places resumed. In North China, there were occasional deliveries, but no longer in the form of whole bolts and boxes like before the war. It was just a few yards and a few sets, etc. However, at that time, sales in Hankou and Wuchang suddenly became active. This was because our full-scale war had expanded to the inner perimeter of the Yangtze River, which created a deformed prosperity in Wuhan. Some Shanghai woolen fabric firms sent people to Wuhan via Ningbo and Wenzhou to "sit in the village" and supply spring and summer goods as much as possible. Therefore, the domestic sales of the woolen fabric industry at this time almost became one-sided - to Wuhan.

But finally, at the end of summer, Wuhan was lost again, and sales in Wuhan disappeared again.

Since then, the domestic sales of woolen fabrics have become stagnant. Now, the postal transportation in North China has almost been restored. Customers from Pingjin, Qinghan, and other places have also come to Shanghai to allocate goods this spring, but the quantity has been reduced to half of what it was before the war. Wuhan and other places are tightly sealed off by the Yangtze River, and transportation is even more unpredictable. They all unanimously declared that British and American goods will soon have no place in North China and the Yangtze River. This is, of course, the inevitable result of being squeezed out by others. The future of domestic sales of woolen fabrics will certainly not escape this tragic encounter.

### Starless Grand Gathering – Sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association – Charity Tea Dance Competition

In the great Shanghai, which has become an isolated island, the atmosphere is extremely dull. The disaster relief movement in a passive sense is what everyone should do. Many flexible daughters revolve in the jazz music and neon lights every day. It seems that although they are full of smiles, they are like a group of merchants who do not know the hatred of the subjugated country. But in reality, the flattering smiles and greetings are their professional duties and the attitude they should have. And they should also not lag behind in all public welfare matters. In the past, they have done a lot of work in charity drama performances and assisting in fundraising, creating several outstanding achievements.

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in order to seek the best use of people's talents and to enable the dance girl group to have an effective opportunity, after the fundraising committee under its dance hall group initiated, plans to unite all the dance stars in various dance halls to hold a grand "Charity Tea Dance Competition" for a continuous month. After contacting various parties in separate ways in recent days, everyone was happy to hear the news and felt great excitement, and all the methods were quickly agreed upon, and starting from July 1st, they were able to mobilize and engage in it as a whole.

The location of the tea dance conference was decided to be held at the former Xianle Dance Palace, starting on July 1st, temporarily limited to one month, and the time was set from 3 pm to 8 pm every day. The dance tickets are specially printed as a kind of fruit voucher, one yuan per ticket, one ticket for three dances. These fruit vouchers are divided into two types: ten yuan per book and five yuan per book. Please ask the dance girls from each venue to enthusiastically recognize and sell them. Regarding the distribution of dance girls, each dance hall will assign 30 to 35 excellent dance girls, with seven days as a period. Each period is divided into seven groups, and each group will send four people from Monday to Friday, and five people each on Saturday and Sunday. A mixed organization method will be adopted to allow the red dance stars from each venue to participate equally, just like a grand gathering of famous actors, with a general gathering every day. The conference will have commendation methods for each star who enthusiastically participates. In addition to preparing various honorary trophies, certificates, and thank you awards, the association's various commercial industry groups will also collect a large number of gifts from major stores and national goods factories, and borrow a location in advance to display them publicly. After the tea dance conference ends, a closing ceremony will be held to distribute them to the dance stars with excellent results, as a glorious memento.

Entertaining for disaster relief, this kind of entertainment is really good. And for the enthusiastic sisters in the dance world, this is a good opportunity to serve the victims of the disaster. At the same time, their competition for the first place among all Shanghai dance stars and the first place among the excellent stars in each dance hall is even more different from the unconscious "dance country election". Because everything is for the relief of refugees, that is a very glorious thing, and it is also a conscientious work that everyone should do their best to do. Therefore, during this month, under the competition of the general mobilization of all Shanghai dance stars, the result will definitely be very satisfactory, and it will be enough to create immeasurable blessings for the disaster victims. It is definitely something that can be guaranteed. (Xin Shi)

### Service Record of "Safety Movement"

— Chi Xian

Grandmothers and nannies often say that we are illiterate. Special residents swagger around.

For the sake of the safety movement, I was assigned to serve at the corner of Simalu and Guangxi Road.

Before departing, the principal specially gathered us together. In addition to giving us an armband, a small flag, and dozens of leaflets, he also gave us a brief lecture.

I arrived at the designated location at 8:20, just in time for office hours. Cars drove from the racecourse one after another, and there were also many pedestrians. The grandmothers and nannies returning from the small vegetable market walked along with large baskets and small baskets, talking to their companions. They often walked side by side in groups of three or four, so one or two of them would leave the sidewalk and walk on the side of the road. They were talking in a low voice, and they would not stop until the car was about to hit their feet. I specially distributed leaflets to these people, but most of them refused to accept them. Some said, "I don't know how to read," and some said, "I don't know how many times I've seen this thing." Unfortunately, the leaflets issued by the safety movement have only been of this kind for the past few days. The pictures are not very moving, and the words are not popular enough. Especially because there is no color, even the children are not interested – but we know that in ten traffic accidents, at least seven of the victims are ignorant children.

Around nine o'clock, the special residents of Shanghai who carry birdcages came from the racecourse in droves with their coats open. Their chest-out and stomach-out walking posture forced the women coming from the opposite side to give way. However, even when the women's feet stepped on the side of the road, either a car rushed in front or the Dongbao coachman shouted for them to make way from behind. But the special residents still swaggered forward, sometimes even bumping into the women next to them with their buttocks, and then turned their heads to look at the victims and grin.

I said, "Sir, please don't walk so horizontally."

"What! Is there even a style to walking?" He still swaggered forward.

The road surface of Simalu, from the "Zhungan King" to the intersection of Guangxi Road, is narrow enough to only allow two small Austins to pass. However, to the east of this section of road, there is a small vegetable market and the famous Qingpeng Pavilion. After ten o'clock, there are very few people coming and going to the small vegetable market. However, the Qinglian Pavilion has many people entering and exiting all day long. In addition, there are several teahouses and restaurants arranged opposite each other. The cars for wedding and funeral celebrations are constantly coming and going on this road. To the west of this section of road, in addition to the same number of restaurants, there are also two theaters, the Da Luotian and the Tianchan Stage. When the show starts and ends, it is either cars driving through the crowd or people walking through the cars! At such a crowded intersection, the two arms of a single police officer are naturally not enough to guarantee safety! Speaking of police officers, I found many shortcomings in my short service time. First, he condoned the chess players to gamble on the sidewalk. Even after my request, he did not intervene. Later, several of us serving classmates insisted that he drive them away. He then lazily whispered to a man in a black Indian silk long gown standing next to the chess stall, and the chess stall was immediately removed. This is really puzzling. Secondly, his traffic control seems to be particularly tolerant of cars. Sometimes, when the car is still at the entrance of the racecourse, he ignores the rickshaws and free cars waiting at both ends of Guangxi Road, so the vehicles on both sides of Guangxi Road are gathering more and more.

Because Wangping Street was blocked, people going from Simalu to Wumalu had to detour through Guangxi Road. Therefore, the number of pedestrians on Guangxi Road increased sharply. I believe that the reason why there have been so many traffic accidents in Shanghai recently is not only due to the faults of pedestrians and drivers, but the biggest reason is still that the area of the road cannot accommodate so many people and cars. Therefore, under such circumstances, simply passively organizing a safety movement will not achieve perfect results, and the opening of several alleyways and passages will definitely contribute more to the safety of pedestrians than us standing under the hot sun for a few days.

But in terms of the current environment, the safety threats faced by the people of Shanghai are indeed greater than traffic accidents. However, this does not seem to be a problem that can be solved by issuing a few leaflets and pasting a few slogans. When I was tired and passed in front of the Fulai Hotel after serving, it seemed as if several cars were preparing to devour my flesh and blood – so I felt that this safety movement organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council gave us another powerful inspiration: "If we are content with 'safety', we can hardly hope for 'total safety'."
