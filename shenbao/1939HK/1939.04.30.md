### The Qualitative Change of Wartime Journalism

— Fan Changjiang

(1) Political Capital Replaces Commercial Capital

What are the similarities and differences between the news work in the second phase of the War of Resistance and the first phase? We can determine from many aspects that the journalism in the second phase of the War of Resistance, compared with the first phase, has changed not only in quantity but also significantly in quality. It can be said that it is different from the first phase of the War of Resistance and also different from the period after the victory of the War of Resistance. During this period, although the Japanese invaders are at the end of their rope, they will try their best to make a final show of strength. When the dying embers of the enemy glow brightly, many inland cities may be harassed by them. Newspapers built on commerce, relying on advertising and distribution for their survival, will inevitably be shaken and gradually decline. Except for the two special zones of Shanghai and Hong Kong, although commercial newspapers still exist, advertising and distribution revenues have sharply decreased, the sources of paper and ink have become difficult, and the distribution network and readership have shrunk day by day. Therefore, local governments and stationed military units, in order to satisfy the spiritual food of the military and civilians, have to publish small, even mimeographed or lithographed newspapers in their respective locations. The political capital of the newspaper industry then replaces commercial capital. Therefore, we predict that the upcoming newspaper work will be very difficult and the form will also be very special.

(2) Human Foundation Replaces Material Foundation

After fighting for a full twenty months, the general newspaper industry in our country is still built on a material foundation. The most important thing for the newspaper industry is material resources (including financial resources). If we have money, we can hire editors and workers to run newspapers, and there are no other difficulties. In the latter half of the second phase of the war, the material foundation became unreliable. On the one hand, commercial capital was destroyed, and there was no extra financial resources to do as one wished. On the other hand, the necessary materials for newspapers were painfully felt to be unavailable, and there was no way even with money. Will the loss of the material foundation of the newspaper industry hinder its existence value? No, not at all. Instead, the newspaper industry shows a new posture and steps into a new era. Human activity replaces the material foundation, and human skills make up for the lack of material. In the future, as long as there are people, there will be newspapers, and the abundance or scarcity of materials is not important. With a radio and a mimeograph, one can publish brilliant newspapers. At this time, the newspaper is fluid, human-centered, and relies on the human spirit to make up for the lack of material.

(3) Unity-Based Replaces Region-Based

After the newspaper industry is built on a human foundation, new types of newspapers will appear throughout the country. Although their circulation is not wide and their economy is not good, their distribution is extremely even and deep, reversing the old problem of being lopsided and adjusting the bad phenomena of expansion and anemia. The most intense color of this period is human activity, requiring tens of thousands of news practitioners to open up this special new world. In the past, the news organizations, which were rich in regionalism, will be washed away and changed by the raging torrent of the great era. After that, new cadres are urgently needed. With the new cadres as the core, unite the surrounding members, and absorb young men and women who are enthusiastic about the newspaper industry to form an organic whole of news practitioners across the country, adjusting surpluses and deficiencies, communicating what is available and what is not, and distributing them reasonably and appropriately throughout the country, regardless of before or after the Japanese surrender, and regardless of the front or the rear. The current tasks of news practitioners are first, unity, second, unity, and third, still unity. Only by taking unity as the foundation can we break through the current difficulties, achieve arduous missions, and contribute to the War of Resistance and national construction.

### World Trends in a Week

— Pan Lang

From April 23rd to 29th, Year 28 [1939]

The last week of April can be said to be a frightening period of calm before the storm.

In Europe, the struggle between the two fronts has shifted from a head-on conflict with arrows drawn and bows strung to each side's diplomatic activities. Among them, Germany and Italy's attempt to entice countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, the United Kingdom and France's consolidation of the Balkans, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and Romania, and the Soviet Union's expansion of the anti-aggression front movement are most noteworthy. And it ended with Hitler's speech on the 28th. At the same time, in the diplomatic struggle, the war preparations of both sides are even more tense.

In the Far East, our active and advantageous War of Resistance against Japan continued to make significant progress. At the same time, the voice of expanding the anti-aggression front to the Far East shook both sides of the Pacific. Therefore, the Japanese aggressors were even more embarrassed. Although there were no important activities this week, new military and especially political conspiracies were being actively planned and even promoted.

The United Kingdom and France Suddenly Seek Divine Help

Under the intensified threat and attack of the fascist aggressors, the capitalist governments of the United Kingdom and France adopted a policy of "suddenly seeking divine help." On the one hand, they tried their best to win over the Soviet Union, on the other hand, they vigorously promoted war preparations, and at the same time, they tried their best to maintain the small countries on the periphery?

This week, the United Kingdom and France continued to implement the above policies. First, regarding diplomacy with the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and France invited the Soviet Union last week to support peace in Eastern Europe. At that time, the Soviet Union had put forward concrete proposals (see "One Week" last Sunday). The United Kingdom and France immediately conducted consultations. According to a Reuters report from London on the 2nd, the United Kingdom and France are reviewing and can establish a compromise plan. Maisky, the Soviet ambassador to the United Kingdom, returned to Moscow on the 22nd and had important talks. Maisky left the Soviet Union and returned to the United Kingdom on the 23rd. People generally believe that the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union are very smooth. Approximately the United Kingdom and France will each conclude a new agreement with the Soviet Union. Second, regarding the various small countries, the British government first attempted to create a neutral group in the Balkans (including Bulgaria) so that the countries could help each other and stabilize the eastern Mediterranean. The second is to stabilize Poland and Romania. The London "Sunday Times" on the 23rd stated that the attitudes of the two countries, Poland and Romania, have become clear and decided to revise the joint anti-Soviet agreement to meet the trend of the times. On the 24th, talks between the United Kingdom and Romania were held in London with the theme of expanding the relationship between Poland and Romania. According to the British announcement, the talks between the United Kingdom and Romania ended on the 26th with extraordinary success. However, in fact, whether the United Kingdom can seize these satellite countries from the hands of the German and Italian demons depends entirely on the United Kingdom's determination and strength to oppose aggression. Therefore, we see third, the British government hastily announced the implementation of conscription on the 26th, and formally notified Germany and Italy on the same day, expressing its firm opposition to aggression. The French cabinet also examined an important defense plan on the evening of the 21st, asking the people to continue to sacrifice. This kind of armed defense of democratic peace by the United Kingdom and France can indeed inspire people.

Important Statements from the United States and the Soviet Union

The United States' attitude against fascism and aggression is more thorough and clear. First, it expressed its full support for the cooperation negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union (Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd). Second, the revision of the Neutrality Act has made great progress. The majority of congressmen advocate assisting the United Kingdom and France and implementing economic pressure on Japan (Washington, 14th). Third, US President Roosevelt submitted a bill to Congress on the 25th to create a new agency. He said: "In this autumn of lawlessness, when people are trying to destroy democratic governments, there are shameless people who believe that the institutions of democratic countries are becoming weaker and weaker due to the maintenance of democracy, so they are trying to act rashly. This reorganization of government institutions is also to answer their challenges!" Fourth, the United States is actively preparing military work to resist aggression and is promoting a great plan to increase the army, navy, and air force. In addition, it is also planned to mobilize 1.2 million people to participate in wartime work within a few months. The large fleet, which was ordered to return to the Pacific, passed through the Panama Canal on the 27th. Fifth, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is improving day by day. Air force cooperation negotiations are going smoothly, and the Soviet Union's non-stop flight also departed for the United States on the 28th.

The entire Soviet Union, from the Party, the government, to the vast masses, in the past, present, and future, is the most loyal member of the democratic peace front and the most heroic vanguard of the anti-aggression front. Recently, the facts show that first, it solemnly suggested to the United Kingdom and France to establish a broad collective security system to guarantee each other's territorial integrity with mutual assistance agreements, and its scope should also include the Far East (see the French Foreign Ministry mouthpiece "Le Matin" on the 22nd). Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov also advocated that the general staffs of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union should discuss concrete measures to assist the invaded countries. He also stated that if the general staffs of the three countries can determine the responsibilities shared by each country, the Soviet Union can prepare to assist Romania, Poland, and any countries in the British and French group (Associated Press, London, 22nd). Second, the Soviet Union has been working hard to organize a collective security system recently. Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin has visited various Balkan countries. On the 26th, he consulted with Bulgaria, which is being incited by Italy. On the 28th, he arrived in Ankara and discussed the Black Sea defense issue with the Turkish authorities. Potemkin will also go to Romania and other countries for talks. Third, Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom Maisky left the Soviet Union for the United Kingdom on the 23rd due to the cooperation between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. On the 27th, he went to Paris and first consulted with Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu on aid to Romania. He will also have talks with France.

These actions of the United States and the Soviet Union are naturally of great help to the anti-aggression movement.

Germany and Italy are Struggling Hard

The German and Italian aggressors naturally have their countermeasures against the resistance of the democratic and peaceful countries. What's more, in the democratic peace front, the governments of the United Kingdom and France, while vehemently stating that they will no longer retreat, are still secretly opening the back door, hinting that there is still room for discussion! (The main fact is that the British and French ambassadors to Germany, who were once recalled due to Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, have now returned to their posts one after another. British Ambassador Henderson also met with the German Foreign Minister on the 25th, stating that if Germany has any further acts of aggression in the future, the United Kingdom will resist.) Therefore, the German and Italian aggressors can continue their aggression plans. The first is to implement a policy of threat and deception against the British and French group of countries. They are trying their best to win over Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, Poland, and other countries. They are using the restoration of Bulgaria's lost territories as bait to lure Bulgaria into joining the anti-communist group; they are using the German-Romanian economic agreement to persuade Romania not to join the anti-aggression front; Italy is even using Hungary to win over Yugoslavia. Germany is also actively preparing to conduct direct negotiations with Poland (but Poland has refused). In addition, activities against Turkey, inquiries to Northern European countries on whether they feel threatened by Germany, etc., are all attempts to attack the anti-aggression front and reduce the value of Roosevelt's proposal. The second is to strengthen the unity of the aggression group. The first is to use Italy to make the South and Hungary understand each other; the second is the scheduled visit of the Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to Germany on the 28th. The purpose is to closely cooperate between Germany and Italy. In addition, an Associated Press report from Paris on the 25th also stated: Recently, Japan plans to return some of the mandated islands in the Pacific to Germany so that Germany and Japan can use them as naval bases; this plan is not only to strengthen the unity of the aggression countries, but also to prepare to launch a pincer attack on the democratic and peaceful countries such as the United Kingdom and France from the east and west! Third, Hitler delivered a long speech on the 28th, stating five points; "(1) Germany has not destroyed peace, and Roosevelt has no right to reproach Germany; (2) Germany has not participated in any world wars in the past 20 years. The National Socialist Party has repeatedly requested disarmament after taking office, which shows that Germany really loves peace; (3) All the countries mentioned in Germany's telegram to Roosevelt replied that they were not threatened by Germany; (4) The German government will no longer send representatives to any meetings that resemble the Locarno Treaty in the future; (5) Germany believes that the Anglo-German naval agreement and the German-Polish treaty have both become invalid." His speech, which tried his best to cover up his faults and manipulate his tone, first rejected the US peace proposal and then announced the Anglo-German naval agreement and the German-Polish agreement. The democratic and peaceful countries should give up their illusions and take a stronger anti-aggression front to strive for the establishment of a collective security system with strength!

Japan is Panicked

Under the increasingly fierce resistance of China, the Japanese aggressors were already trembling! How could they withstand the active progress of the international anti-aggression front! Therefore, the Japanese aggressors had to show their panic. First, after the news of the expansion of the anti-aggression front to the Far East spread, the Japanese authorities became anxious. On the 22nd, Tokyo's "Kokumin Shimbun", "Miyako Shimbun", etc., all attacked the democratic and peaceful countries with rogue scolding and intimidation, especially attacking the United Kingdom. "Miyako Shimbun" even claimed on behalf of the military: "The United Kingdom's actions of assisting China and being close to the Soviet Union have made the relationship between the United Kingdom and Japan increasingly tense, and have reached the point where the United Kingdom and Japan may fight each other." Then, the anti-foreign movement in the occupied areas of the Japanese army in China, especially the anti-British movement, became even more rampant. Second, the Japanese Five Ministers held a meeting on the evening of the 23rd to discuss their attitude towards the European situation. Although there was no concrete decision, they all felt that Japan would become increasingly isolated internationally, and they felt that the return of the US fleet to the Pacific posed a serious threat to Japan. The Tokyo "Hochi Shimbun" on the 24th even said that this was: "An act of provocation by the United States against Japan." Third, the opposition of the Japanese people to the anti-communist group and the internal divisions of the Japanese government became increasingly serious. As the Tokyo correspondent's report published in the London Times on the 27th said: "All the people of Japan, except for the military, are unanimously opposed to concluding a military alliance with Germany and Italy. The majority of members of the Japanese cabinet also hold this view."

From this, we can see the large number of enemies that Japan has made internationally today and the dangerous environment in which it is in; from this, we can also see the seriousness of the internal divisions in Japan and the vague disappointment in the future of aggression. This is the first achievement of our adherence to unity and the War of Resistance, and it is also the first achievement of our opposition to Wang Jingwei and other "anti-communist peace" activities.

Of course, the Japanese aggressors still have new conspiracies. These conspiracies can be roughly divided into three points; first, with the German and Italian aggressors, under the rule of military阀专制, they can only increase unity. Although Hitler's speech on the 28th did not mention the Far East, in fact, they will divide and force non-aggressive countries from the east and west. The Associated Press report from Paris on the 25th, which stated that Germany and Japan colluded to build naval bases in the Pacific, can be regarded as a clear example. Second, Japan is further implementing intimidation and temptation against the United Kingdom and France in order to frustrate the United Kingdom and France's policy of uniting with the Soviet Union to aid China, and then to coerce the United Kingdom and France to mediate the Sino-Japanese War and force China to submit. Although this possibility has been reduced due to the increase in China's War of Resistance strength, it is indeed an unchanging strategy of Japan. As for the United States, it is trying to avoid conflict to avoid the interruption of the source of munitions and raw materials. As for the Soviet Union, it is making factual concessions to avoid suffering immediate losses. Third, against China, it will intensify the use of Wang Jingwei and others' "anti-communist peace" movement to sow discord between our government and the people and the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in order to undermine the cause of the War of Resistance and national construction and to coordinate with the plan of "consolidating the occupied areas and establishing a puppet central government" to prepare for the launch of a new military offensive.

The Situation of the War of Resistance in a Week

The above has briefly described the recent plans of the Japanese aggressors against China. As for the military aspect, the main purpose is still to open up the Pinghan and Yuehan railways and consolidate the occupied areas east of the two railways. At present, on the one hand, it is intensifying disturbances along the coasts of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. The situation in Wenzhou, Fujian, and Shantou is still very tense; on the other hand, it is moving towards northern Hunan in an attempt to seize Changsha and control the Yuehan Railway. All these actions are the factual manifestation of the above-mentioned operational objectives. In addition, in the northwest, it has been defeated and there is no possibility of taking the offensive for the time being. In the southwest, although there are still disturbances everywhere, especially the threat to the Siyi area, there is no active attempt to move it to the main battlefield. As for the North Ping electric transmission on the 28th, the Japanese spokesperson said that 25,000 new soldiers will continue to be added to the war in North China, the purpose of which is probably to deal with our operations behind enemy lines.

In order to break the military plans of the Japanese, increase the difficulties of the Japanese army, stop the Japanese army's offensive, and boost the morale of our army, we began a counter-offensive on various battlefields two weeks ago. This counter-offensive is going quite smoothly. There have been significant victories in North China, Central China, and South China. It has not only greatly boosted the morale of the people in the rampant activities of traitors such as Wang Jingwei, but also greatly improved the combat effectiveness of our army and greatly improved our country's international status. The Japanese military plan, especially the new offensive plan, has been severely hit and frustrated.

In the past week, we have still maintained an active and advantageous position, and the counter-offensive on various battlefields has made new progress. What is particularly important is that our army has repeatedly counter-attacked and rushed into Nanchang. On the afternoon of the 27th, our army rushed into Nanchang for the third time and launched fierce street fighting. At the same time, our follow-up troops also arrived in the suburbs, converging from inside and outside, and encircling and annihilating a large number of Japanese troops. This victory not only broke the propaganda of the Japanese and traitors such as Wang Jingwei that "the Japanese army has not been defeated and is still invincible", but also stopped the Japanese army's offensive against northern Hunan, which has significant political and military significance. And the valiant fighting of our army and the improvement of the combat effectiveness of our army have deepened the understanding of people all over the world. In addition, our army threatens cities such as Beijing and Jinan in North China; on the Longhai Railway, it re-entered Kaifeng on the 20th and surrounded Xuzhou since the 22nd; on the eastern battlefield, it once entered Hangzhou on the 7th and fought street battles with the Japanese army for several hours; in South China, it continues to threaten the suburbs of Guangzhou. In other areas, such as southeastern Jin, our army recently annihilated more than 10,000 Japanese troops (Central News Agency, Tongguan, 28th), and our air force also showed great power and was active on various battlefields for several consecutive days, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese army. This is completely different from the past, when only our side was bombed.

At present, we have made strict arrangements in northern Hunan, the future center of the war. Commander-in-Chief Chiang decided to concurrently serve as the Supreme Commander of the Central China Region, personally directing the armies of the X, X, and X war zones to stop the Japanese army's offensive. A temporary headquarters has also been set up in a certain place in Hunan Province. The defense arrangements in the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi areas for three months have now been fully completed. The fortifications in the Hengyang, Changsha, and Zhuzhou areas are particularly strong. Secondly, there are also important deployments along the coasts of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. (1) The combat effectiveness of the New Fourth Army on the borders of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Fujian is growing day by day. (2) In the past, there were many rumors about the war preparation in Fujian Province, but recently, after Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong of the X War Zone and Director Bai Chongxi of the Southwest Headquarters went to Fuzhou in person, although they "brought the bombing of Japanese planes", they swept away the "atmosphere of peace" and quickly prepared to resist Japan, which may be able to avoid danger. In addition, the situation in Chaozhou and Shantou is quite urgent. Although General Hua Zhenzhong is leading with all his strength and preparing for the war of resistance, it is hoped that the government will pay attention to the strengthening of the front-line combat effectiveness and the reform of political institutions in that area, and the development of mobilization work. Chaozhou and Shantou are important strongholds in the War of Resistance in South China and Southeast China. They are also currently the key to the sea outlet from Chongqing, Guilin, Hunan, and Shaoguan in the west. We must do our best to defend them!

What is the Future of China?

Whether from the domestic and international situation or the War of Resistance situation, the future of China is bright! Especially after Commander-in-Chief Chiang published a statement last week, announcing that Wang Jingwei and his accomplices were traitors to the country by colluding with the enemy, and announcing that Wang Jingwei and his like had been sentenced to death in spirit, "the future of China is bright" has become a common sense for every Chinese and international public opinion.

Soviet newspapers were the first to publish the full text of Commander-in-Chief Chiang's speech, expressing great satisfaction, and believing that the Chinese supreme leader's determination to fight the War of Resistance to the end is also the expression of the determination of the entire Chinese people. The Soviet Union's movement to sympathize with and assist China has unfolded more enthusiastically.

British public opinion also unanimously praised our heroic War of Resistance. On the 22nd, the British Manchester Guardian also commented, praising: "Observers with clear minds and far-sightedness all believe that a new and powerful culture that has a significant impact on the youth of the world is now developing in the Far East. The source of this new culture is the active development of its Far East territories such as Siberia by Soviet Russia and the decision of the Chinese government to develop the western provinces." The newspaper also said that "China is fighting the War of Resistance independently without any signs of defeat. China's contribution to peace-loving countries is no less great than the disarmament of the United Kingdom or the peace proposals of President Roosevelt."

In politics, there is the plan expressed by Commander-in-Chief Chiang in his interview with the Dagongbao reporter on the 25th regarding the reform of lower-level administrative institutions and the establishment of the foundation of democratic politics. In economy, there is the importance of emphasizing the land policy of the Three People's Principles in wartime in Commander-in-Chief Chiang's speech to the Land Administration Society on the 22nd. In diplomacy, there is the telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Madame Chiang on the 24th congratulating the Pacific Northwest Conference for urging the embargo on munitions to Japan, and Ambassador Guo Taiqi's appeal in Europe to the great powers to expand the anti-aggression front to the Far East. In the construction of the west, there is the active promotion of the Western Sichuan reclamation plan and the enthusiastic support of the border people for the construction of the new Western Sichuan. In the military, there has been greater progress in the construction of the new air force movement, and there are also news of large purchases of aircraft materials. All these news this week are enough to make people excited and dance.

However, this progress and efforts of ours are obviously far from meeting the needs of the objective situation. Whether in politics, economy, diplomacy, front-line military affairs, or rear construction, we have not yet reached the necessary degree to end the transitional period of the War of Resistance, overcome the difficulties of the stalemate stage, and prepare to advance the general counter-offensive; on the contrary, the enemy and traitors' conspiracies of sowing discord, spreading rumors, and framing, especially the activities of "anti-communism" and "peace", are being promoted in various ways that are difficult to prevent! The recent news of the extension of the recess of the National Political Council and the failure of the lists of provincial senators to fully reflect the democratic spirit and cooperation between the parties is not only inconsistent with the intentions of the supreme leader and the national policy of the central government, but will also give the enemy and traitors a chance to spread rumors! We hope that the government will make quick and appropriate remedies, and that the necessary degree of improvement in the people's lives and the promotion of the wartime democratic spirit are the prerequisites for overcoming difficulties and winning victory. They must be turned from resolutions, declarations, texts, and outlines into facts in order to achieve the practical effect of mobilizing the whole people and ensuring victory, and to live up to the high expectations of all countries in the world for us!

### The Gan, Hubei, and Hunan Provinces are Under Our Control; The Enemy Has New Designs on the Provinces of Shanxi and Henan; Sugiyama Holds a Military Conference in Xinxiang

(Special dispatch from our Chongqing office, 29th) Fierce battles between our forces and the enemy continue several miles outside Nanchang. The enemy reinforcements are putting up stubborn resistance, so the struggle is particularly intense. After the enemy invasion of Heshan in southern Guangdong, we reinforced our forces and attacked, and the situation has stabilized. The mountains of Heshan, Gaoming, Kaiping, and other places are steep, making it difficult for the enemy to advance. We continue to fight the enemy in the areas between. After the enemy invasion of southern Shandong was repelled, we took advantage of the momentum to push forward, already approaching the Jinpu Railway Line, constantly launching attacks on the enemy. Our guerrillas are also extremely active in the Xuzhou-Lianyungang area, and the eastern section of the Longhai Railway has been cut off by us.

[Dispatch from our Chongqing office, 28th] Although the enemy is busy shifting forces on various battlefields, there has been no significant increase in troop numbers. Most of their supplemental soldiers are Taiwanese, Korean, Mongolian, and puppet troops. The total number of enemy troops in China is still less than one million. Their morale is declining, so even if they launch another major offensive, there is nothing to fear. Our troops in Gan (Jiangxi) have attacked and reached Qingyunpu, a scenic area in the southern suburbs of Nanchang, and are advancing towards the county seat. Wuning is only four or five miles from the city, and Fengxin is a little more than ten miles from the city.

[Special dispatch from our Chongqing office, 28th] In southwestern Shanxi, the enemy has retreated to various transportation hubs to put up stubborn resistance, and we are still attacking. General Sugiyama, commander of the enemy's North China Dispatch Army, arrived in Xinxiang by plane on the 22nd to inspect and hold a meeting, and returned to Beiping on the 23rd, seemingly with new designs on Henan and Shanxi. The commander of the enemy's 21st Division, Shiozu, is in Kaifeng, where there are currently more than 4,000 enemy troops. From the 23rd to the 27th, we attacked the western gate and railway station of Kaifeng every night, achieving many victories. The enemy's invasion of Changying resulted in the massacre of over a thousand civilians, and the burning of eight out of ten houses in the village. They have now been repelled by us.

Northern Jiangxi and Southern Hubei

[Special dispatch from our Guilin office, 29th] With the defense of Changsha as our operational objective, we simultaneously launched offensives in Jiangxi and Hubei, launching fierce attacks on the enemy who had not yet established a firm foothold. Currently, the following routes are seeing rapid progress by our forces: (1) The main force of our army attacking Nanchang is still engaged in fierce battles with the enemy north of Xiebu and Liantang. Our advance plainclothes troops reached the suburbs of the city on the 18th, surrounding Nanchang on three sides. The enemy transferred several thousand troops from the Nanxun Road, attempting to make a desperate stand behind the city. (2) The troops on the west bank of the Gan River, after recovering Gaoan and Dacheng, engaged in fierce battles with the enemy at Wanshou Palace on the afternoon of the 27th, and then advanced to Shengmi Street. On the 28th, they advanced again to the vicinity of Niuhang. The enemy transferred about a thousand troops from Nanchang, bypassing Shengmi Street and attacking Gaoan City, attempting to attack our flanks. We are currently blocking them. (3) A certain unit west of Fengxin once attacked Fengxin and engaged in street fighting with the enemy, then retreated to a certain place in the northwest. This route of our army was originally intended to be used for an imperial system, causing the enemy to tie up a portion of their forces in that area, unable to rescue Nanchang. (4) Our army, having recovered Tongshan, is advancing towards Chongyang. In the Battle of Baichang Bridge, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated to Chongyang. We are currently pursuing them. Although the enemy in Yueyang has increased by several thousand troops, due to the setbacks in southern Hubei, they are in grave danger, and are therefore extremely panicked. Considering the overall situation, the enemy's attempt to attack Changsha has not only completely failed, but is now completely under our control, and they are paying the price.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Zhangshu, 28th] This afternoon, an enemy plane flew low over Gaoan to reconnoiter, and was hit by our anti-aircraft machine guns and crashed in the suburbs of Gaoan. We are currently searching for it.

[Dispatch from Associated Press, Chongqing, 29th] According to Chinese sources, Chinese guerrillas attacked Nanchang, breaking through the Japanese army's outer defenses. The flanks enveloped the Japanese army from the east and west. The vanguard of the Chinese army entered the city and engaged in fierce street fighting for several hours. According to the latest reports from the Chinese side, the Chinese army is still firmly holding the Japanese army's positions outside Nanchang. The left wing of the Chinese army has captured Jiaji, Xincunxu, Wuliuji, and other places. The right wing of the Chinese army crossed the Wu River and counterattacked Zhongheyi, Fulunji, and the Nanchang Japanese army airport, with considerable success. Two thousand Japanese troops are currently extending along the Gan River to reinforce, attempting to break through the Chinese army and suppress the flanks of the Chinese army. They were defeated by the Chinese army south of Nanchang. The fierce fighting in the suburbs of Nanchang is extremely intense, and the Chinese army has forced the Japanese army to retreat into the city to defend. A authoritative military official told an Associated Press reporter that it is currently difficult to speculate when the Chinese army will be able to recover Nanchang, because the strength of the Japanese army coming from Jiujiang to reinforce has not yet been ascertained. The Chinese army's counterattack is not intended to recover Chang, because Nanchang is only the capital of a province and has little to do with the Chinese strategy. The true value of the Chinese army's counterattack lies in shattering the Japanese army's attempt to attack Changsha, and at the same time proving the rumors that the Chinese side is preparing to make peace are untrue. This counterattack has announced to the world that China will continue to resist to the end without compromise. At the same time, Chinese sources also stated that the Chinese army is currently surrounding Fengxin to contain the Japanese army and prevent them from providing reinforcements. The Japanese army in Songbu once attacked the Tianjin line of the Chinese army and was immediately severely damaged by the Chinese army. The Chinese army also attacked Taru and engaged in fierce street fighting with the Japanese garrison for several hours before retreating. The Japanese army in Wuning is actively building defensive works to hold firmly. Yesterday, 500 Japanese troops, supported by 12 tanks and 3 aircraft, attacked the Chinese army's front line near Wuning from Ruoxi, and were repelled by the Chinese army. Fierce fighting resumed today, and was still ongoing at the time of dispatch.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Dongxiang, 28th] Our troops attacking Nanchang from the southeast of the Gan River are making unusually rapid progress. A certain mobile unit of our forces, after recovering Wuduanxu and Dafota, advanced rapidly to the northwest, and on the evening of the 28th, crossed the railway line, bypassed Liantang and Xiangtang, cutting off the enemy's rear in Liantang and Xiangtang, and trapping them in a four-sided encirclement.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Fengcheng, 29th] After our recovery of Shengmi Street, we have continued to make progress and are advancing north. The enemy in Wanshou Palace, although supported by reinforcements at one point, barely managed to hold on, but after our repeated encirclements, the time of their collapse is not far away.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, East 29th] The enemy's two strongholds of Liantang and Xiangtang are under heavy siege by our forces. On the 29th, more than a thousand enemy troops marched south along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to reinforce, attempting to save Nanchang from its perilous situation. This reinforcement of enemy troops is also under our siege.

Southeastern Shanxi Province

[Dispatch from a certain place in southern Shanxi, 27th] In order to end the mop-up operation in North China, after invading central Hebei, southern Hebei, and southern Shanxi, the enemy then invaded southeastern Shanxi, attempting to attack our base areas. They launched fierce attacks simultaneously on three routes, northwest, south, and south, first occupying Fushan and Anze, then capturing Wanghe and Dajiang (south of Tianjingguan in Jincheng). The northern route was particularly fierce. The enemy, with a force of one division, personally commanded by Division Commander Anan, occupied Wanghe on the 3rd and then advanced eastward, attacking various important places south of our Fen Shui Ling (Watershed Ridge). On the 11th, they moved towards Gucheng, intending to threaten our Wuxiang and Yushe. To the north, they directly drafted Zihongkou in five routes from Huima Wangjiapo and the valley entrance. A certain unit of our forces was surrounded. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of the unit fought bravely, using the strategy of fighting from the inner line to the outer line, and fought fiercely for six days and nights, managing to break through the encirclement in the evening. At the same time, a certain unit of our forces also dispatched troops north to Taigu, causing the enemy to rush around without rest. They have now retreated step by step. Gucheng, Fen Shui Ling, Wangtao and other places are free of enemy traces. They are stubbornly resisting in the three strongholds of Wanghe Nanguan Zihong.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Xi'an, 28th] Military news, on the 17th, over two hundred enemy troops and four artillery pieces from Xikaikou (north of Hejin) advanced towards our positions on three routes. They fought fiercely with us until evening, and routed the enemy on the two routes of Lao Junguan and Eighty Turns. The other route is currently confronting us.

### A Great Victory in the Air Battle over Hanzhong; Our Planes Sortie to Southern Shanxi to Assist in the Battle; Three Accomplishments in One Day

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Yuanqu, 29th] Amidst the fierce battles in southern Shanxi, our brave air force once again came out to assist in the battle this morning, demonstrating their great prowess. A total of our aircraft sorties to the Zhongtiao Mountain area at 8:00 AM this morning to cooperate with our army in attacking the enemy, achieving remarkable results. They then flew over the city of Yuncheng and the airfield occupied by the enemy in the suburbs of the city, dropping many bombs, with nineteen hits. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses, and the details are being investigated. After our air force accomplished their mission, they flew back to their original defense. At around 10:00 AM, they encountered seven enemy aircraft bombing Hanzhong near Hanzhong. Meeting on a narrow road, we met the enemy with planes and launched a fierce air battle. Our air force's superb technology, despite the enemy's aircraft outnumbering ours, still resulted in one enemy aircraft being shot down. The remaining enemy aircraft fled in panic. The wreckage of the aircraft we shot down is being searched for. According to our air force, one sortie has resulted in three achievements, and their heroic spirit is truly admirable.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, ××, 29th] At 7:45 AM, seven enemy aircraft invaded the airspace over Xi'an. Our aircraft immediately went to intercept them. At 8:30 AM, we encountered our aircraft in the airspace over Nanzheng. We bravely attacked and, after a fierce battle, shot down two enemy aircraft, which both fell in the area east of Nanzheng. One of our aircraft was slightly damaged and forced to land, but the pilot was unharmed. The rest returned to their defense safely. According to the Anti-Aircraft Command, seven enemy aircraft came, and five returned, and their formation was in disarray. It is now confirmed that an enemy Type 97 fighter plane crashed south of Lantian at Jin Gong Temple with the plane destroyed and the pilot killed. Investigation shows that during the air battle of Nanzheng, its fuel tank was hit by us, causing excessive leakage, and it crashed midway. Another aircraft is still under investigation. Also, at 7:30 AM today, a certain unit of our elite aircraft bombed the enemy's advanced headquarters and air force base in Yuncheng with pouring bombs, hitting the target. The enemy suffered significant losses. Our aircraft completed their mission and returned safely side by side. According to our air combat personnel, the number of aircraft parked at Yuncheng Airport is less than before. This is clear evidence that our attacking troops are near the suburbs of Yuncheng.

### Enemy Warships Reconnoiter Chaoshan; Shell Hedu Gate in Chaoyang; Enemy Planes Heavily Bomb Shanwu Bridge in Shantou

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Shantou, 27th] At 6:00 AM on the 27th, five enemy warships suddenly appeared at the mouth of the Shantou Ma Gorge and fired several shells at Hedu Gate in Chaoyang. They also sent armed ships to reconnoiter the coast around Shantou and Chaozhou. Up until 12:00 PM, enemy aircraft took off three times from the enemy warships there, attacking Chenghai, Shantou, and Chaoan. They heavily bombed Shanwu Bridge in Shantou, dropping twelve bombs, destroying more than ten civilian houses and injuring more than ten civilians. The enemy warships are still hovering in the waters off Shantou and have not left.

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 29th] On the morning of the 27th, a unit of enemy cavalry attacked Zhuliuhe, about 20 kilometers north of Heshan City. We fired calmly, killing more than ten enemy soldiers. The enemy then fled in defeat.

### British Press Observes the Overall Situation in the Far East; British Attitude Remains Extremely Active; Enemy Morale in a Steep Decline

[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 29th] The local newspapers today are paying unanimous attention to the recent fierce debate within Japan regarding the issue of turning the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance. The majority opinion is that, despite frequent pressure from Germany, it will still be difficult to conclude a military alliance. Hitler's speech did not mention Japan's willingness to participate. Some newspapers believe that Japan is willing to conclude a military alliance with Germany at most to resist the Soviet Union. This observation is completely in line with what well-informed Japanese sources in London told Reuters reporters. They said that Japan would only be willing to get involved in the European war if it was attacked by the Soviet Union. The information obtained by these Japanese claimed that the Japanese Navy Ministry opposed the alliance proposal most strongly, believing that it was completely inconsistent with traditional policies. President Roosevelt's peace proposals to the dictators and the simultaneous dispatch of the British fleet back to the Pacific undoubtedly surprised Japan and made it dare not resist Britain. Political figures also agreed with the observation that it is difficult for Japan to conclude an alliance with Germany. Japan's recent attitude towards Britain has obviously eased greatly compared to before. The fierce and threatening anti-British attitude of a year ago has now subsided greatly. They are now willing to listen carefully to Britain's protests and notes. It would be a supreme mistake to assume that Europe's busy affairs have made Britain forget its interests in the Far East. According to what Reuters has learned, the opposite is true. The methods and scope adopted will depend on the progress of events. The "Financial Times" published a lengthy commentary, stating that Japan's attempts to forcibly exchange currencies and import controls in North China "have almost completely failed." The reason why commerce in North China has not been completely interrupted is entirely because the Japanese side either knows the importance of this issue or is unable to enforce all of its new regulations. Close attention is also being paid here to the Chinese army's major counteroffensive, believing that China has indeed achieved a great deal of success. Military observers told Reuters reporters that, regardless of whether the Chinese army's current counteroffensive to recover Nanchang and Guangzhou is a wise move, the impact on morale is enormous. This is enough to make Japan fall into a steep decline and prevent them from making any further progress. Although the air of peace is still frequently seen, the fact is that there is no room for compromise among the combatants.

### The Enemy in Shanghai Threatens the Concessions; Forbids the Hanging of National Flags

[Dispatch from Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 29th] Regarding the request to ban the "pro-Chiang" remarks of various Chinese-language newspapers in the Shanghai concessions, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai yesterday made another request to prohibit the hanging of the national flag of the Republic of China on the anniversary days of May Fourth and May Thirtieth to avoid "terrorist incidents."

### Order from the National Government

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, Chongqing, 29th] The National Government issued an order on the 29th appointing Luo Wenmo as the Secretary-General of the Provisional Senate of Sichuan Province. This is the order.

### Counterfeit Money Will Become Waste Paper; Market Price Has Been Plunging for Days

[Dispatch from Reuters, Beiping, 29th] The market price of counterfeit currency issued by the counterfeit United Reserve Bank has plummeted for days. There were no transactions today.

### Stabilize the Foreign Exchange Market; Control Foreign Trade; Increase Exports; Prohibit the Import of Luxury Goods; The Government is Currently Considering Effective Measures

[Dispatch from Associated Press, Chongqing, 29th] Local financial figures stated that the Chinese government is currently working to adopt effective measures to control imports into China. The method will mainly focus on our customs and the management of foreign exchange. The Chinese government is currently concerned about the excessive number of imported goods, especially luxury goods. Therefore, it has ordered the customs to restrict the import of such goods, and the purchase of foreign exchange will only be approved if the goods are absolutely necessary. This policy is fully in line with the government's aim of stabilizing foreign prices. At the same time, the Chinese government is also planning to increase foreign trade in order to obtain foreign exchange.

### On the Northwest Shanxi Battlefield with the慰勞Inspection Team (Part 1)

—Ji Chang

[Dispatch from Min Ge She, Northwest Shanxi] Last October, when the enemy once again launched an offensive in Northwest Shanxi, and occupied Xinling in Ningwu Shenchi and other counties, the front line慰勞 inspection team composed of various agencies and organizations in the Second Administrative Region of Shanxi, set out from Kelan under extremely tense battle conditions, embarking on their journey. In the icy and snowy Northwest Shanxi, they trekked for over a thousand miles, reaching the true front line of national defense, spending over fifty days, and returning to Kelan fully loaded with valuable gains and victorious achievements, which was completely unexpected for them.

The sixteen members of the 慰勞 inspection team, in order to be able to conduct guerrilla warfare when necessary, equipped themselves with weapons. Kelan was under constant alert threats when they set out. Most of the residents in the city had already completed the "clearing the houses" work. On the way to the front line, they only saw retreating residents and the families of some troops, but did not see people returning. The news from the front line was sometimes bizarre and terrifying, but in order to complete the sacred mission, they were still rushing forward. Because most of the troops in front were stationed in the mountains, they had to take mountain paths. On the snow-covered mountain roads, they climbed, jumped, and advanced bumpily. Sometimes they walked in thick snow, exposing only the upper half of their bodies; sometimes, because they could not find the path, they wrapped their heads in leather jackets when going downhill and slid down. One day, they only walked thirty miles from morning to night, which shows how difficult the journey was. But it was precisely on these "high hills" that our guerrillas were active.

The footprints of the 慰勞 inspection team crossed the borders of six counties and慰勞ed more than twenty units of troops. Their 慰勞 work methods were: (1) Talking with all the soldiers, (2) Holding a joint military-political gala, (3) Singing and performing art, (4) Presenting national flags. When they talked with the soldiers, the soldiers were all encouraged and grateful, and shouted slogans. At the joint military-political gala, all levels of the entire group could raise some meaningful questions and valuable suggestions. For example, when they were慰勞ing a certain guerrilla troop, it coincided with the double "Twelve" anniversary, so they discussed the meaning of the double "Twelve" incident. Although opinions differed slightly at first, after discussion, they unanimously believed that the double "Twelve" incident objectively determined domestic unity and laid the foundation for the united front.

### How Xie Stole the Enemy's Military Mail: Account by Sergeant Wang Shulin

— Notes by Zhang Changren

When I was in Changsha, I heard that Sergeant Wang Shulin of the ×th Division of our army in northern Hunan had penetrated the enemy's lines and returned with a large amount of the enemy's military mail. Therefore, on April 2nd, I departed from Changsha to inspect the front lines in northern Hunan, intending to visit the soldier's unit's location for an interview. Upon arriving in Miluo, I learned that the unit was guarding the front lines on both banks of the Xinqiang River. On April 10th, I reached the division headquarters near the Xinqiang River, but he had just been ordered to set off for Yueyang to scout the enemy situation. I missed him. It was not until April 16th that I finally met him in ××× south of Miluo Jiang, as he had already completed his mission and safely returned with enemy documents and books.

Mr. Wang has delicate features and a moderate build. He was wearing a black short shirt and trousers, and he answered the reporter's questions with sincerity and clarity, and was very humble. However, his demeanor and bearing immediately revealed that he had received military training for many years. After completing his report, he still deeply regretted that while he had the desire to serve the country, his education was insufficient. I happened to have the book "Japanese Spies" with me on my journey, so I gave it to him, hoping it would slightly increase his knowledge of espionage.

According to the Chief of Staff of the ×th Division, Mr. Wang is very courageous and ambitious. Each time he goes on a mission, he always tries to achieve more than the original task. When he detects any counter-espionage activity in his espionage operations, he will eliminate it with all his might. He is truly a genius spy. - A note by Changren

My name is Wang Shu; I am from ×××, Yueyang. I am twenty-three years old this year. My father has passed away, and my mother is over sixty years old. She and my elder brothers and sisters-in-law are still farming in ×××, barely managing to make a living.

At the age of fourteen, I graduated from a small school in my hometown and joined the Yueyang County Government Security Team as a messenger. A year later, I became a formal member of the security team. At the age of seventeen, I felt that the security team had limited prospects, so I was introduced by a friend to Nanjing to join the machine gun battalion of the Garrison Headquarters. In December 1937, the machine gun battalion was placed under the command of the 51st Division of the Army. On December 13th, I was wounded in action near Yuhuatai outside the capital of Nanjing. I was treated in wounded soldier hospitals in Huanggang and Wuchang, Hubei. At the end of January last year, I returned to my home in Yueyang to recover from my injuries. By March, I had fully recovered. I saw that the country had reached this point, and there was no better thing for a young person to do than to join the army, so I joined the Yueyang Regular Army again. In November last year, the ×th Division was fighting in the Xinqiang area, and because I was a local, I was recruited as a plainclothes soldier with the rank of private first class.

For the past five months, my comrades in the plainclothes team and I have often entered the enemy's rear in the Yueyang area to scout the enemy situation. I have been arrested four times, but I have escaped each time. The incident of me stealing the enemy's military mail was an opportunity I stumbled upon after my first arrest.

It was on January 9th when I was ordered to set out from the guerrilla camp near Yuan Shaozhong Village to scout near Yunxi Station, about thirty to forty li from Yueyang. I disguised myself as a farmer in Pingdi Li Village, carrying a load of sweet potatoes northward into the enemy's security line. I had previously obtained a so-called "Good Citizen Certificate." (It was four inches long and two and a half inches wide. The words "Identity Certificate" were written horizontally on top, followed by "Name," "Address," "Occupation," and "Age." Below was the signature of the "××× Autonomous Committee." In addition to the committee's seal, there was a small circular stamp with "Naito" on the corner of the cloth.) Because the enemy wanted to lure the people back to their hometowns, they let me pass when they saw this cloth strip. In the area between the front lines of our two armies, there were more than ten li where the common people were still farming. The enemy's general fortifications were not much different from ours, but the strongholds were mostly constructed with reinforced concrete, and there were two or three layers of wire mesh outside. They could only be destroyed with artillery. They were well concealed, and sometimes it was difficult to detect them even up close.

When I arrived at Yunxi Station, I was surrounded by a dozen Japanese soldiers. At first, they ate my sweet potatoes casually. Finally, a military policeman came and tried to persuade me to become a puppet soldier, and forced me to walk with him with a gun. The streets of Yunxi are close to the railway station. After walking not far, we turned into a city house. The house was also surrounded by barbed wire. As I walked in, I paid attention to finding a way out. It was a row of three rooms. He led me into the middle one and locked the door.

There were already five or six farmers in their twenties and thirties in the room, sitting on the hay, both angry and scared. Although they didn't know me, they expressed sympathy for my misfortune. Looking at the lattice windows, they didn't seem very strong. I thought that escaping might be the only way.

I went in at around 3 PM. After 5 PM, another military policeman suddenly opened the door and ordered me to come out. He gestured for me to sweep the house for them. I gladly picked up a dustpan and broom. There was a sign reading "Great Japan Post Office" hanging on the door of the room on the left. I peeked in through the window and saw that the narrow, long table by the window was piled with many letters and paper rolls. I guessed it was the military post office. The room on the right was the kitchen. I caught a glimpse of a shiny kitchen knife on the chopping block, seven or eight inches long and two inches wide, looking somewhat like a butcher knife. I swept the floor. Taking advantage of the Japanese soldier's unpreparedness, I grabbed it and hid it in my coat, then he locked me back in the middle room and gave me a small tube of steamed rice with a small piece of rather fishy salted fish on top.

I silently hid the knife in the hay without anyone in the room knowing. Then, I sat near the wall, watching the sky outside the window gradually darken, listening to the sounds of the Japanese soldiers' leather shoes and horses' hooves. With my hands behind my back, I dug a small hole in the ground with the knife and buried the knife inside. When it was dark, the people in the room all fell asleep on the hay. Listening outside, the number of people walking had also decreased. I took out the knife in the dark and slowly began to cut the window bars. It took me more than two hours to remove three of them, enough for one person to squeeze through.

It was about 11 PM. ××××× was snoring loudly. I jumped out of the window, determined to steal the military mail before escaping. I walked to the window of the "Post Office", pushed it, but it was locked inside. Using the knife, it didn't move. The two large packages of mail on the table were tempting me in the dim light. I gently broke the glass first, then reached in and opened the window. I grabbed a package, but I don't know if it was because I was panicking or because the narrow table was not stable, but it fell to the ground with a "boom." At that point, I could only "take the best of the thirty-six strategies, which is to leave." I immediately dashed out of the house, crossed the barbed wire short fence, and ran wildly into the darkness to the southwest. The Japanese military police chased after me. A gunshot rang out, and the Japanese soldiers hiding in the fortifications also blindly fired into the darkness like the saying "one dog barks at a shadow, and a hundred dogs bark." After running three or four li, the enemy bullets were still whistling over my head. At this time, I felt that carrying the items was too heavy—each package of mail weighed about eight or nine pounds—and would definitely not be fast, so I decided to reluctantly abandon one package. After walking another six or seven li, the dense gunfire faded far behind.

So I rested in a small pine forest on a small hill, and then slowly carried the package of mail back.

At dawn, I had to cross the new highway that the Japanese had built south of Yueyang. I saw six or seven sentries walking towards me half a mile away. I crossed it as if nothing had happened. By the time they noticed me and shouted at me to stop, I had already entered the woods on the side of the road. They chased for a while, but in the end, they did not dare to chase into the woods.

Two days later, I returned to the division headquarters, presented my spoils, and reported the situation in detail. That package of mail was wrapped in Japanese reeds. Inside, there were more than four hundred letters and dozens of rolls of newspapers and magazines. It was immediately forwarded to the higher-level military headquarters. Later, I learned that there were many materials inside for us to use as reference. There was also fresh evidence of the enemy soldiers' war-weariness. Among them was a list of the names of enemy soldiers who were wounded in action with us in Nansuzhou. In one battalion (Note by the reporter: A Japanese battalion consists of four companies, each with more than two hundred and ten people. There are more than seventy light and heavy machine guns, with stronger firepower than our regiment), the number of wounded reached one hundred and fifty, not including those who died. I also saw the "Wuhan Daily" published by the enemy for the first time.

The division commander awarded me twenty yuan at the time. A few days later, the army headquarters and the army corps headquarters also awarded me one hundred yuan each. They also promoted me from private first class to sergeant. I am really very grateful. However, rewards and promotions are not the purpose of my work. I only regret that I have not studied enough and cannot help the country more.

When I was in Yueyang, I often met the commander of the Ritsuda Regiment, riding a warhorse alone, carrying a pistol, to the house of our female compatriots that he had forcibly occupied. I really wanted to find a way to take a gun and finish him off. But for the greater purpose, I have not yet received the order to do so. (April 27, on both sides of Miluo.)

### Tensions Rise in Eastern Europe: Germany Revokes Treaties and Threatens Poland, Britain Steps Up Defense Preparations

[Reuter Berlin, 28th] The German envoys in Britain and Poland today presented memorandums to the British and Polish governments respectively, revoking the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German-Polish non-aggression pact. The memorandum to Britain recalls Chamberlain's statement from Munich, that "Chamberlain and Hitler both regard the agreement as an expression of the hope of Germany and Britain never to wage war against each other." The document added that Germany regrets that Britain's policy of reconciliation with Germany has been increasingly distant recently. Although the Anglo-German Naval Agreement has been abolished, Germany hopes that this move will not affect the qualitative rules of the navy, so as to avoid unlimited naval building by various countries. The document revoking the German-Polish treaty states that Poland's agreement with Britain clearly contradicts the solemn declaration made when the German-Polish treaty was signed a few months ago. The German government is only surprised by the sudden change in Poland's policy. The Anglo-Polish agreement is a direct action against Germany, and is also a direct opposition to the declaration of 1934, which mutually agreed to oppose the use of force. Poland has expressed its willingness to abandon the peace guarantee given by the German government and accept the promise of assistance from a third country, which is to endorse the policy of encircling Germany. In fact, Poland has implicitly revoked the declaration of 1934, but Germany is unwilling to abandon its original intention of German-Polish reconciliation. If Poland does not forget the old friendship, Germany still wants to conclude a new treaty with Poland under the condition of providing each other with clear covenants.

[Associated Press London, 29th] After Hitler's speech, Britain has stepped up its defense preparations as a response to Hitler. Many men in various military departments in Britain have automatically enlisted. Former Foreign Minister Eden has also enlisted. Hitler's announcement of the abandonment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is regarded here as a political bluff. However, Hitler's abolition of the German-Polish agreement is considered a serious move. It is expected that Germany will infringe on Polish interests and incite Britain and France to implement their guarantee of aid to Poland. Also, diplomatic circles here believe that Hitler's announcement of the abolition of the German-Polish agreement will force Poland to re-edit its foreign policy and closely cooperate with the Soviet Union.

[Reuter Berlin, 28th] Although the newspapers here enthusiastically welcomed Hitler's speech, foreign political circles have frankly expressed pessimism. A diplomat told a Reuter reporter that the question now is no longer whether war will occur, but when war will occur. The general interpretation of Hitler's speech is that although Hitler knows that the fate of Europe depends on how he resolves the Danzig issue, he is still determined to follow his own path to resolve it. Most people are now comparing Hitler's anti-Polish methods to his methods of destroying Czechoslovakia. If the two are parallel, it is believed that his second step will be to make broader and more forceful demands on Poland.

[Reuter Warsaw, 29th] The authorities here have not criticized Hitler's announcement of the abandonment of the German-Polish treaty, but Hitler's abandonment of the treaty was expected, so it is not surprising. According to reports here, Poland's national policy is based on its own strength, not relying on the guarantee of treaties. The government newspaper "Polish Express" stated that Danzig must maintain its current state, and Poland will never allow any other nation to usurp its rights and sovereignty in Danzig. The newspaper said, "The only point that can be revised is the abolition of the League of Nations' power," meaning that Poland is prepared to jointly establish a German-Polish joint management agency to replace the current domination of the League of Nations.

[Reuter Berlin, 28th] In addition to the 888 members of the German Parliament, Hitler's speech also reached countless listeners around the world via radio. Hitler's reply to President Roosevelt's suggestion was expected and did not cause surprise, because everyone expected Hitler would never accept President Roosevelt's suggestion and would explain the reasons for his refusal. General observation: Following Hitler's speech, German newspapers will launch a fierce attack on Poland. In the past few days, newspapers have repeatedly published news of "Germans being abused in Poland." Political circles explain Hitler's statement that Germany is willing to provide guarantees to any country that needs them should not be regarded as accepting President Roosevelt's suggestion. This guarantee only involves Germany and the guaranteed country, so in the event of a breach of contract, it has nothing to do with third countries.

[Central News Agency Danzig Free City, 28th] In the speech delivered by Hitler today, there was a section involving Danzig. National Socialist Party members all expect that the city will be merged into Germany on May 1st. The police here have temporarily canceled their holidays, and the National Socialist Party's stormtroopers have also been ordered to come.

[Central News Agency Lithuanian Capital, 29th] According to observations in Lithuania, the current situation has not eased due to Hitler's speech, because the tense situation between Germany and Poland may engulf Eastern Europe in a vortex.

[Central News Agency Berlin, 29th] Hitler's speech yesterday lasted two and a half hours, with a very slow pronunciation, and accompanied by various gestures. The two main points were attacking Britain and abandoning the German-Polish treaty. When Hitler read the names of more than 30 countries listed in President Roosevelt's telegram, the whole audience burst into laughter. When he mentioned Palestine, the auditorium was filled with laughter for half a minute.

[Associated Press Warsaw, 29th] Officials declared that they rejected any unilateral attempt to resolve the Polish-German issue through pressure, but Poland attached great importance to the points mentioned in Hitler's speech and the German note, and considered them to be a sign of goodwill. Although the Polish side strongly stated that the German side, not the Polish side, abandoned the Polish-German non-aggression pact, well-informed sources believe that the possibility of continued negotiations has not completely disappeared.

[Reuter Warsaw, 29th] The "Warsaw Daily" declared today that "Poland will never agree to Germany's proposals for Danzig and building roads in the Polish Corridor." The newspaper also stated that Poland had not received proposals regarding the 25-year non-aggression pact and guarantees for Slovakia.

[Central News Agency Berlin, 28th] Hitler's speech has just been commented on by experienced observers. They all said that Poland is in the same situation as Czechoslovakia in 1938 and will become a sacrifice to Germany's eastward expansion policy. However, Hitler will go to his villa in Hudesladen after the celebration of National Labor Day on May 1st. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will also go to Hungary next month to return the visit. It can be seen that Germany may not take immediate action against Poland. As far as the German plan is concerned, it should start with propaganda to incite various ethnic minorities within Poland. This is no different from what was done to Czechoslovakia in the past. At the same time, it will also carry out diplomatic activities in Southeastern Europe, especially Romania, to isolate Poland. This plan takes a long time and is more difficult than dealing with Czechoslovakia before. This is also acknowledged by German political circles. Observers also said that Germany has long coveted the Ukrainian region and recently proposed to Poland to jointly invade it, but Poland refused to accept it because it feared that it would become a vassal of Germany.

[Associated Press London, 28th] Before leaving for his weekend holiday, Chamberlain met with Foreign Minister Halifax for 45 minutes. It is reported that the two discussed Hiller's speech and the abandonment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement.

### Reactions to Hitler's Speech from Various Countries: Britain and France Are Not Surprised, Balkan Countries to Hold a Meeting

England

[Reuter London, 8th] London is now carefully studying Hitler's speech. Officials are unwilling to express their opinions temporarily before studying it in detail. Regarding the abandonment of the naval agreement, it is believed here that since there is no exchange of information, maintaining the proportional rules is of little value. From a legal point of view, the unilateral declaration of the abandonment of the treaty is invalid. The German document stated regarding the declaration of abandonment of the naval agreement that the agreement was concluded on the principle that Britain would not interfere in Germany's policy in Europe. This concept is completely wrong, because the negotiation process never involved this matter. Britain strongly denies that British newspapers have been encouraged to adopt anti-German attitudes. Britain does not need to oppose all of Germany's future problems in Europe. Britain's actions are definitely not based on anti-Germanism, but are determined to oppose aggression. People generally believe that Germany should have invited Britain to discuss together before abandoning the agreement, instead of taking unilateral action. It is reported that Britain is ready to respond to Germany at an appropriate time.

[Reuter London, 29th] According to a Reuter naval reporter, Hitler's decision to abandon the Anglo-German Naval Agreement did not cause much surprise. Officials have not criticized it. However, according to those who pay attention to current affairs, the agreement has no major impact. Anyway, in terms of the current ratio, the German navy cannot catch up with Britain. If Germany wants to draft a large-scale naval construction project, its exhausted economy will inevitably feel more difficult. Moreover, the construction of giant ships cannot be completed overnight, so even if Germany implements the construction of additional warships, it can only focus on submarines.

France

[Reuter Paris, 28th] The first reaction in Paris to Hitler's speech was "Hitler is still delaying." The content of the speech was not as rude as imagined. Hitler has repeatedly defended the reasons for forcibly annexing Czechoslovakia, which is indeed influenced by world public opinion. The firm attitude of Britain and France has led to the British conscription, but this is just the beginning of expressing the attitude of Britain and France. The abandonment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is not surprising, because this move was expected. The cancellation of the German-Polish agreement proves that the key in the future is still Poland. At the same time, there is no reason to form the belief that the efforts of democratic countries to maintain peace have been discouraged.

[Associated Press Paris, 29th] French senior officials listened to Hitler's speech in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister's residence yesterday. It is said that the speech was not as fierce in form as previous speeches. The two points of Hitler's announcement of the abandonment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the Polish-German agreement are considered extremely serious. However, there is no direct attack on France in the speech. They expressed indignation at Hitler's attack on Britain and the United States. As for the attitude towards the entire speech, it is said that it can only be published after detailed study.

[Associated Press Paris, 29th] It is heard here that officials regard Hitler's speech as a cunning defense, which does not help the European crisis. The French Ministry of the Army has confirmed that the French-Polish alliance has been completed. Officials here are not surprised by Hitler's abandonment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, and said that Germany's naval power is difficult to surpass Britain and France. Germany may only be able to build more submarines.

Romania

[Reuter Romanian Capital, 28th] Germany's announcement of the abandonment of the German-Polish agreement is just enough to promote the cooperation and connection between Poland and Romania. It is reported that after Romanian Foreign Minister Fenco returns to the country, the Balkan Pact countries will hold another meeting in the Romanian capital to discuss the issue of Bulgaria's territorial demands. It is expected that the Balkan Pact countries will maintain their firm attitude towards the claim of territorial change as in the past. However, economic cooperation will be allowed for Bulgaria.

Italy

[Reuter Rome, 29th] Caida published an article in the "Italian Daily" expressing extreme support for Hitler's speech, saying that "This shows that Germany and Italy will not passively be placed in a policy of being encircled."

[Associated Press Washington, 29th] "Italian People's News" declared today that Roosevelt is a foolish and speculative person. Hitler's rejection of his rogue and cunning suggestions has made the chaotic situation in Europe clear. The newspaper repeated Roosevelt as a "hippopotamus" and said that it hoped this lesson would be enough to make Roosevelt dare not interfere in other people's affairs again.

Japan

[Reuters Tokyo] The newspapers here published Hitler's speech in a prominent position and vigorously promoted it. "Asahi Shimbun" wrote an article criticizing that Britain, the United States, and France had attributed the responsibility for any war to Germany and Italy. Observing Hitler's speech this time, it can be proved that this is unfounded. Germany and Italy are now trying to avoid using this terrible method to complete their demands. However, Britain and France still hope to maintain the status quo, which will eventually lead to international war.

### Italian Cabinet Passes Increased Military Spending, Air Force Reservists Ordered to Enlist, Italian-German Military Talks to Be Held

[Haitong News Agency Rome, 29th] According to official announcements, the Italian Prime Minister informed the cabinet of the resolutions on the meeting with the Army Director and the Minister of Finance in Locagadra Gamena, which were unanimously passed by the cabinet meeting on Sunday morning. It was decided to increase the strength of the Italian army, and it was also said that the military budget would also be added to meet the expenses of expanding armaments and national defense organizations.

[Associated Press Rome, 29th] The Italian government has recently ordered all reserve pilots below the rank of captain in the air force to resume military service. This order will include those who have not been active in the aviation industry for three years and those who are over 45 years old and work on civil aircraft. It is reported that Mussolini is now considering cooperating with Germany to resist British conscription. This matter will be passed by the cabinet today. Mussolini will discuss everything with the German Chief of Staff on Sunday. The chairman of the German Aviation Association has arrived in Genoa.

### Hitler's Speech in Response to U.S. Proposal; Delivered to U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Germany; U.S. Congressional Members Extremely Dissatisfied

[Reuters, Berlin, 29th] It is claimed here that government authorities have delivered a copy of Hitler's speech to the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Germany as a response to President Roosevelt's proposal.

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] Some members of Congress have expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the tone of Hitler's speech, describing it as ranting and grandstanding. Representative Bloom, acting chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said, "Hitler talks grandly about world peace while simultaneously issuing a serious ultimatum to Poland." Senator Pittman believes Hitler has regarded his speech as "an act to terminate world peace negotiations."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] Sources with inside knowledge say that Hitler's speech offers only a glimmer of hope to those full of illusions. Hitler's abrogation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement and the German-Polish Treaty is the most appropriate standard for commenting on the full text of the speech. Hitler's response to President Roosevelt's peace telegram is sufficient to show that Hitler's concept of values ​​is contrary to the traditional concept of the West. Every person with Western thought, who would not be heartbroken? Although we cannot abandon all hope because of this, it is evident that the work of maintaining peace must rely on the full efforts of mankind.

[Central News Agency, Hyde Park, NY, 28th] The President's press office has announced that Roosevelt was asleep when the German leader delivered his speech today and did not wake up until 8:20 a.m., when the speech had ended. This incident will not affect state affairs.

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] It is reported that President Roosevelt may respond to Hitler's speech during one of his domestic broadcasts.

### Hitler Announces Gains from Annexation of Czechoslovakia; Astonishing Numbers of Military Supplies

[Reuters, London, 28th] In Hitler's speech, he stated the following military supplies were obtained by Germany after the annexation of Czechoslovakia: 1,582 airplanes, hundreds of anti-aircraft guns, 2,175 artillery pieces, 469 tanks, 43,876 machine guns, 1,000,000 rifles, 1,000,000,000 bullets, 3,000,000 shells, and a lot of specialized motorcycles. He is expected to visit various places for public review and meet with Italian Air Force Minister Badoglio.

### New York World's Fair to Open Today; President Roosevelt to Deliver Speech

[Reuters, New York, 28th] President Roosevelt will not mention Hitler's speech at all during his address at the opening ceremony of the World's Fair on the 30th.

[Associated Press, New York, 28th] Although the White House does not acknowledge that Hitler's speech is a response to the United States, observers believe that when the President attends the opening of the New York World's Fair on the 30th, he may again denounce dictators for endangering peace in Europe.

### Soviet Pilot Kokkinaki Flies to America

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 29th] Soviet pilot Kokkinaki departed from Skolkovo yesterday at 9:00 PM (GMT) via Estonia and Greenland, flying to America without landing along the way.

### U.S. Fleet Passes Through Canal

[Associated Press, Panama, 29th] The U.S. fleet has now completely passed through the Panama Canal, and its auxiliary vessels also followed the main force this morning. Twenty-one merchant ships were thus obstructed and must wait for all the warships to pass before proceeding. At the same time, it is announced that the U.S. fleet is scheduled to return to the Pacific on Tuesday of next week.

### Franco-Dutch Commercial Treaty Initialed

[Central News Agency, Paris, 29th] The Franco-Dutch commercial treaty was initialed last night.

### Report That Britain Will Offer Germany a Non-Aggression Guarantee

[Associated Press, London, 27th] It is reported that Britain will offer Germany a non-aggression guarantee as a response to Hitler's speech, expressing that Britain has no hostility towards Germany. After Britain takes the lead in proposing this, the 31 nations listed by Roosevelt will also participate. While these negotiations are underway, Britain will continue its efforts to conscript troops and organize a large European peace front as a guarantee for negotiations with Germany.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 29th] According to sources with inside knowledge, the British Ambassador to Germany will meet with the German Foreign Minister in the coming days. One of the British proposals will be to guarantee Germany against foreign attack, in an attempt to ease British-German tensions. Political figures here say that given the current public debate in Britain, it is difficult to reopen negotiations with Germany, so British-German relations are unlikely to improve.

### British Chancellor's Speech Warns Germany; French Foreign Minister Meets with Soviet and U.S. Ambassadors; Soviet Union Supports Collective Security Policy

[Reuters, London, 29th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon gave a speech at the Royal Albert Hall last night, warning Germany to pay attention to the changes in British policy. Simon detailed Prime Minister Chamberlain's efforts to establish a friendly agreement in Europe and testified that Britain was not to blame if this agreement failed. Britain has now established new treaty obligations with Poland, Romania, and Greece, and what has caused Britain to change this policy is Germany's actions. The so-called German policy, that only Germans should be incorporated into Germany, is in fact incorrect. Recent events are very different from this. If the purpose of such actions is to dominate all of Europe, Britain will inevitably resist.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 29th] French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with the Soviet and U.S. ambassadors today. According to informed sources, the Soviet ambassador told the French Foreign Minister that if the Baltic countries encountered unprovoked aggression, the Soviet government was prepared to provide military assistance. He also said that the Soviet Union still supports a collective guarantee policy to maintain peace. The U.S. Ambassador, after hearing the results of the French Foreign Minister's talks with the Soviet ambassador, then stated Washington's attitude towards the German leader's speech. It is heard that Bonnet wanted to explore Foreign Minister Gafencu of Romania's views on accepting Soviet aid.

### U.S. Government and Public Unanimously Advocate Economic Sanctions Against Japan; Embargo on Munitions, Restriction of Trade; Increased Wartime Loans to China

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] Senators who support the government's tough diplomatic policy in the Far East are actively pursuing economic sanctions against Japan in Congress, while also seeking to protect U.S. agricultural exports to Japan. Congressional observers say that Pittman's proposal authorizes the President to prohibit the shipment of raw and processed sugar from the Philippines to Japan, but hemp, coconut, and rice, which are staple products, are not included in the prohibition. Pittman's proposal stipulates that the President shall not impose any restrictions on foreign importers who purchase American agricultural products.

[Associated Press, Washington, 27th] If Senator Pittman's proposal is passed, then an embargo and restrictions on U.S.-Japan trade will become a possible reality. At that time, President Roosevelt can make this bill effective through an executive order. This order will take effect ten days after being submitted to Congress, and Congress has no power to veto it. Pittman told reporters that this proposal is essential because the government can use it to lift the restrictions on overseas Chinese in China. In the two years since the war of Japanese aggression against China, the property and lives of overseas Chinese have been repeatedly endangered, their legal rights and interests have been repeatedly undermined, and the language of the Nine-Power Treaty has also been violated by Japan. The government has continuously protested to Japan because of this, but to no avail. The purpose of this proposal is also to authorize the President to assist in reaching an understanding with Japan." Senator Guffey today requested the Foreign Affairs Committee of Congress to pass this proposal so that the President has the power to implement an embargo on Japan and at the same time provide material assistance to countries that have been invaded. For example, "If we continue to supply munitions to the violators of the treaty, how is this different from supplying the enemy with food and strengthening the strength of our future enemies?" Mr. Chase, President of the World Peace Religion Joint Association, requested President Roosevelt to convene a meeting of the signatory nations of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. "We cannot avoid war, but we can only make the whole world avoid war. If Stimson and the United States could have issued a warning to Japan in 1931, then Japan would not have invaded China today." Professor Fleming of Vanderbilt University advocated immediately recalling the U.S. ambassador to Japan, increasing wartime loans to China, and revising the neutrality law to prevent it from being used by aggressor nations. Guffey advocated accepting Thomas' amendment to the neutrality law. If this is implemented, the Far East will also be greatly affected by this, and the terror of war with Japan will no longer exist. Because Japan is already overwhelmed by China, he then condemned Japan for violating the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Mr. Jane, chairman of the Korean Overseas Chinese Federation in Honolulu, attended the House Foreign Affairs Committee today and strongly supported Thomas' amended neutrality bill and the Guam fortification plan (Note: Thomas' amendment proposes to authorize the President to implement a five-currency embargo against any country deemed to be an aggressor). Jane said that this action would eliminate the fear of war in the Pacific, and Hawaii, Alaska, and the Panama Canal could be free from threats for a long time. Thomas' amendment is enough to eliminate Japan's arrogance and increase the morale of China. At this point, Koreans and liberal-minded Japanese will work hard to establish a peaceful phenomenon in the Far East to restore the prosperity of American trade in the Far East. Japan's expansion is a threat to the Western Hemisphere. Jane then quoted the words of the Japanese Consul in Honolulu as follows: "The U.S. President said that in a few years, Japan will eliminate American commercial interests in China, but the U.S. Congress is very wise and does not agree with the President's words, which proves that the U.S. Congress wants peace, and Japan also needs peace." Jane also quoted the speculation of Suzuki, secretary of the Information Bureau of the former Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "Five years later, Japan will demand that the United States allow Japanese immigrants. Even if the United States does not allow it, Japan will at least obtain the right to immigrate to Alaska, Samoa, and Hawaii."

Short Commentary

### U.S. Aid to China, Sanctions Against Japan

In recent days, the U.S. movement to aid China and sanction Japan has been developing actively. A Washington dispatch on the 28th stated that U.S. senators who support the government's hard-line diplomatic policy in the Far East are actively pursuing economic sanctions against Japan in Congress. Senator Guffey requested the Foreign Affairs Committee on the 27th to authorize the President to implement an embargo on Japan and to provide material assistance to countries that have been invaded. Professor Fleming of Vanderbilt University advocated immediately recalling the U.S. ambassador to Japan, increasing wartime loans to China, and revising the neutrality law to prevent it from being used by aggressor nations.

The growing movement in the United States to aid China and sanction Japan is primarily because the Japanese aggressors are stepping up their advances, threatening the United States. As Mr. Jane, chairman of the Korean Overseas Chinese Federation in Honolulu, stated to the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee on the 27th: "Five years later, Japan will demand that the United States allow Japanese immigrants. Even if the United States does not allow it, Japan will at least obtain the right to immigrate to Alaska, Samoa, and Hawaii"! Second, our country's perseverance in the united resistance and the rapidly improving situation have increased the United States' confidence in our country's victory and its determination to provide assistance.

We must now do our utmost to support and promote this U.S. movement to aid China and sanction Japan. At the same time, we must also step up the development of countries such as Britain and France. Japan is currently desperately promoting an anti-British movement. If it is said that "five years later Japan will force the United States to allow immigration," then Japan's current actions towards Britain and France are already forcing Britain and France to withdraw from the Far East! The objective environment is already forcing Britain and France to come out and resist. We must adapt to this situation, promote Britain and France to catch up quickly after the United States, and then establish a Far East anti-aggression front and establish a Far East collective security system.

Telegraph communications are also maintained as normal, but cargo transport between the two places has been reduced to a minimum.

Recently, banditry has been rampant, and robbery and theft have become commonplace. Although the police have been making every effort to investigate and severely punish robbers, they still cannot completely eradicate lawless elements, which has a great impact on public security in Hong Kong. On the 28th of this month, two more major burglary and robbery cases occurred in Kowloon and the New Territories. The details of each case are recorded as follows:

Major Burglary

The Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Youth Day Celebration held a preparatory meeting yesterday at 2 PM at the YMCA.

The important motion of the day was a proposal by Zheng Dechao, representing the YMCA, to incorporate the Self-Renewal Movement into the commemorative ceremony to ensure that Hong Kong youth earnestly fulfill it. Zheng Dechao first reported:

Self-Renewal Movement: Great Significance

Briefly explaining this movement, it has been prevalent in Shanghai for a long time. Those who practice it can improve their personality, gain proper thinking, and eliminate bad habits, benefiting society and the nation as well. It is proposed that after the commemorative meeting that day, each young student in Hong Kong receive a copy of the Self-Renewal Movement Pledge to place on their desks. Student unions of various schools will lead review meetings for a certain period to report on the results after the meetings and learn from each other. [Section Missing] Allowing youth to receive pure thought training is deeply beneficial for the future of the war of resistance. It was then resolved to add a swearing of the Self-Renewal Movement Pledge to the commemorative ceremony, and to consult with student unions of various schools to request their practical leadership and implementation.

Discussion on Implementation, Expanded Event Continued Discussion (1) On how to expand the event, requesting practical leadership and implementation, it was resolved to send letters to various vocational youth groups, intellectual youth groups, worker youth groups, women's youth groups, and student bodies of various schools to participate. The YMCA, YWCA, Student Relief Association, Huiyang Youth Association, and Youth Relief Fundraising Association were appointed as preparatory committee members.

### Factory Association Annual Meeting Yesterday Report on One Year of Association Affairs, Promoting Domestic Goods to Protect the Interests of Fellow Businesses, Cutting Expenses and Continuing to Donate to the Nation

The Chinese Manufacturers' Association held its annual member meeting yesterday at 2 PM to elect the fifth board of directors and discuss amendments to the association's constitution. More than one hundred manufacturers attended. The chairman was Ye Lanquan, and the recording secretary was Han Suixuan.

Chairman's Report When the meeting began, Chairman Ye Lanquan delivered a speech, briefly stating that the present was the annual meeting for the association members and the election of the fifth board of directors. The association was established in April of the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934], and its affairs have been developing daily. In the early years, there were only 51 members, but the number has increased year by year, reaching nearly two hundred members now, which is the highest record since the establishment of the association. During the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], the board of directors held 23 meetings. Important works included the following:

Promoting Domestic Goods (1) When Hong Kong-based Chinese-funded factory products were transported to the mainland, they were taxed as imported goods. Last year, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance approved that products from association members, if transported back to Guangdong Province for sale with a certificate from the association, would be exempt from 20% of various special taxes. (2) After the establishment of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government, all investigations into Hong Kong factories were officially commissioned by the association with official letters. Recently, the ministry issued certificates of origin for domestic goods, and the initial review was also handled by the association. (3) Last year, in order to promote the use of domestic goods and to make compatriots recognize and discuss domestic goods, the association jointly held a Chinese Goods Exhibition in Hong Kong, which was quite successful. In January of this year, to adapt to the environment, it was held again in Kowloon, on a scale several times larger than before, which can be called an unprecedented event in Hong Kong.

Visiting Macau for Investigation (4) In mid-month, at the invitation of Macau officials and gentry, the association organized an inspection team to Macau to investigate industries. Now, there is also a proposal in Macau to organize a Hong Kong-Macau committee. If this matter can be realized, it will truly benefit the industrial and commercial circles of Hong Kong and Macau. (5) Since the "July 7th Incident" occurred, the association immediately joined with the Electrical Appliance Merchants Association to organize a long-term diet and salary donation to raise funds. The association used the funds to purchase Guangdong Province National Defense Public Bonds, donated ambulances, and provided over ten thousand winter clothes to relieve refugees. In addition, there is a request to reduce electricity bills to ease the burden on manufacturers, which is currently underway.

Special Report by Our Newspaper

### After the Wuhan Chorus Left Hong Kong, They Spread the Anti-Japanese Propaganda to Singapore and Beyond

— Qi Zhuo

Mentioning the "Wuhan Chorus," the moving patriotic songs seem to still resonate in my ears. At any singing event, upon hearing, "Fight back to the Northeast! Fight back to the Northeast!" "He killed our compatriots!" "He invaded our land!" [Section Missing], these majestic and rhythmic songs immediately remind people of the "Wuhan Chorus."

Hong Kong's musical standards are not low; it is like a fertile soil in the land of music. However, the Wuhan Chorus cannot be denied as being a gardener, planting seeds of anti-Japanese songs here and sprouting them.

Since the troupe left Hong Kong for Singapore in mid-December last year, the Hong Kong singing community has suddenly become active. Their work in Singapore has also been progressing very smoothly. Recently, the troupe's drama team leader, Mr. Xiang Kun, came to Hong Kong from Singapore, and the reporter had the opportunity to meet and chat with him at the Hotel des Six Nations. During the conversation, Mr. Xiang was filled with the joy of work, and the reporter was also happy with him.

When the Wuhan Chorus set off from Wuhan, they did not have much preparation for drama, so the public performance in Hong Kong last year was just an experiment and attempt, and the results were not as good as the singing, which was not entirely satisfactory. Although the troupe is named "Chorus," it is actually an ordinary propaganda team. In order to strengthen the drama lineup, Mr. Xiang came to Hong Kong from afar to recruit troops, planning to recruit two female roles and one male role. In just a few days, dozens of people applied. Unfortunately, most of the capable actors have already joined group work. Speaking of the criteria for admission, in addition to speaking fluent Mandarin, they should have a high degree of enthusiasm and sincerity for anti-Japanese dramas. After being admitted, the new actors will be provided with food, clothing, housing, and transportation by the troupe. During the day, they will return to the team in Singapore with Mr. Xiang. Under the hard work of Mr. Xiang, the future of the troupe's drama is already showing unlimited dawn.

They have worked in Singapore for four months, performed more than one hundred times, and raised 300,000 national currency for the local relief fundraising association. The anti-Japanese climax in Singapore has become even more surging. They not only moved the upper classes in high-end theaters, but also had a great effect on the common people. They did not just sing choruses. Each performance appeared in the form of singing and drama complementing each other, which is their improved style. Many anti-Japanese groups have grown up in this way.

The love of the overseas Chinese for them is truly meticulous. The wealthy opened their gardens to entertain them warmly, and the vast overseas Chinese donated whatever they had. The Relief Association said that the shoes of the Wuhan Chorus members were broken, and someone sent shoes. Even barbershops often came to offer their services. Their lives have simply become the "public pig" of the overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese are deeply gratified that the "public" has "pigs" to raise. The chorus friends are also deeply gratified that the spiritual comfort gained by the "public pig" is a joy that was unimaginable in their past university life and teacher life. They more deeply experienced how honored it is to serve the motherland and be a "public pig."

Recalling when they set off from Wuhan, Madam Chiang Kai-shek once comforted them: "The country is in urgent need of funds, and it would be best if you can be independent and not use the country's money. If you have economic difficulties in the future, we will definitely give you a helping hand immediately. You should do a good job!"

Now it seems that they not only did not use a penny of the country's money, but also donated all 300,000 yuan they raised to the public. Their daily lives were spent happily in the entertainment of the Overseas Chinese Relief Association and enthusiastic overseas Chinese. Here, we got an inspiration: "Spiritual comfort is better than material reward; efforts to be loyal to the country and the public will surely win the love and help of compatriots."

In addition to engaging in propaganda and fundraising through singing and drama, they have not relaxed their self-education and local liaison work. The overseas Chinese groups in various states of Singapore have heard the news and have asked them to perform. Statistically, it would take two or three years to travel to all the ports of the Malay Peninsula, so the scheduled time for all aspects was cut in half: February was changed to January, January was changed to half a month, and two weeks was changed to one week. They had already left Singapore for Johor in early this month and are still working in Johor. It is expected that they will be able to complete the mission of traveling to the Malay Peninsula in February next year and return to Singapore.

When they were about to leave Singapore, they once held a grand music conference with local music groups and once performed "Thunderstorm" alone. The purpose was to let the overseas Chinese understand that the art of the motherland has progressed to this point, so as to inspire the national self-confidence of the overseas Chinese after the anti-Japanese propaganda. When they performed "Thunderstorm," they specifically publicized that its intention was the advocacy of "art" and "ethics," which was only a side effect and did not conflict with the original anti-Japanese propaganda mission. After gaining the understanding of the overseas Chinese, the fundraising income also increased suddenly, and the overseas Chinese also requested them to continue performing.

According to Mr. Xiang to the reporter: the Mandarin level and music level of Singapore are very high, but the drama is like sand. Their original 28 male and female team members have added several music talents in Singapore, but drama talents have to be found in Hong Kong. One of the main reasons why they were able to have such a harvest this time is that it was the first time that a sound propaganda team and art group went to Singapore.

Their work moved the overseas Chinese, and the patriotic enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese also moved them. In particular, the millionaires generously encouraged their children to join the machine workers' team and return to the country to serve. The patriotic blood flowed into each other; the patriotic sincerity resonated with each other. Wherever there are Chinese, there are interwoven scenes that can be sung and wept. How great the motherland is! How bright the future of the motherland is!

### Kowloon YMCA Establishes Free Schools in Various Districts to Accommodate Homeless Poor Children, Currently There are Six Schools with Twenty Teachers, and Over One Thousand Street Children have Enrolled

In view of the fact that poor children living on the streets in the Peninsula lack education, the Kowloon Chinese YMCA, fearing that they would enter the wrong path and harm society, joined with the headmistress of the Mat Tau Kok Association for Mutual Thought Girls' School, the Western Miss Bu, and many philanthropists to establish many night schools in various places on the Peninsula. The teachers and staff in the schools are all volunteers from enthusiastic families. According to the teacher Hua Zhuoquan, these schools have been opened for four months and are set up in Yau Ma Tei, Mong Kok, Sham Shui Po, Hung Hom, Kowloon City, and Tsim Sha Tsui to accommodate children sleeping on the roadside to enroll and study. The teachers impart civic education and various courses, as well as singing and other knowledge. When the school was first established, it was very difficult. Now, the children have realized that this measure is beneficial to them, so they have enrolled in large numbers. The school sites in each district are donated by enthusiastic churches or schools. If there is no site, it is held in other people's gardens or on the streetside. As for the teachers and staff of each school, they are all volunteers from enthusiastic people, and everyone has a job, so they cannot come out to take charge every night. Now, it is scheduled to start classes from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM every Thursday and Sunday evening. Currently, there are over one thousand children from various districts who come to study, with twenty teachers. On holidays, they lead the children to travel to various places to increase their knowledge. As for the expenses of the school, they are donated by generous donors.

### New Stage of Hong Kong's Drama Movement

— Hu Chunbing

"Huanghuagang" is a glorious monument!

Hong Kong was exposed to Western drama earlier than the mainland; however, that was limited to foreigners and a few "Chinese gentlemen," and had nothing to do with the general public or even intellectuals. Apart from the fleeting appearance of "vernacular drama" of Shanghai's civilized drama, Hong Kong intellectuals' acceptance of drama, generally speaking, came after accepting movies (especially domestic movies imitating Western ones).

Like other cities, drama was initially practiced by school art lovers as a way to experiment with dramatic literature. Then, it became one of the less important but indispensable items in the recreational events. Again, one or two good Productions staged public performances here to raise funds. After the September 18th Incident, drama became a movement among the intellectuals in Hong Kong. After the July 7th Incident, drama gradually influenced citizens, influenced the public, and movies and Cantonese opera, at least in content, had to accept its suggestions. In the past six months, due to the deepening of the war, the southward migration of professional drama troupes, the increase in the number of mainland workers staying in Hong Kong, and the increase in the public's need for drama, the drama movement has written a glorious and brilliant page.

Undoubtedly, the scale of performances has greatly increased, the technology has advanced to a high degree, and gradually, drama can also become an industry, can be constantly worked on, can develop normally, and can provide audiences seeking entertainment with disinfected and nourishing spiritual food. This situation has become more and more obvious since Guangdong became a war zone.

However, in order to make drama a gospel of national liberation, to make drama an enlightenment for the masses, to make drama obey and serve national interests, and to make Hong Kong's drama movement an organic part of China's national salvation drama movement, we have no way to be optimistic and no way to be satisfied with our own work. We need self-examination, self-criticism: we need greater solidarity, more planned division of labor; we need to strengthen self-education, we need the Stakhanovite spirit of blitzkrieg.

We must unite: only in this way will everyone be loving and sincere, and work together, so as not to be infected with the poison of the commercial theater of "actors despising each other" or "competing for business." We must divide the labor: the waste of manpower and material resources of fighting separately, the effectiveness limited to one corner, and the loss is incalculable. Only through common will and precise allocation can drama serve the people and the country more directly and powerfully. We must establish self-education: only in this way can we consciously and firmly fight for the freedom of the nation, and not fall into the quagmire of the "actors" of the past, and become the dregs of the war of resistance. We must practice the spirit of blitzkrieg: only in this way can we stand upright and establish our work in the current difficult environment; only in this way can we, after training, deeply enter the interior or enter the front line, and contribute and sacrifice everything for the survival of the motherland with arrows and stones.

Hong Kong's drama movement does not only belong to drama workers, but also belongs to the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, and belongs to the future of the Chinese nation.

The establishment of the Hong Kong Youth Association is an epoch-making event in the history of Hong Kong's drama movement. Young and pure, enthusiastic drama workers have united, and they will become a team like copper and iron. Workers from Guangdong who have been tempered by the War of Resistance have added even more fresh troops, and they will work together with several drama troupes with relatively rich performance experience in the Chinese Art Troupe of the Era. The united front of the Hong Kong drama community can be said to be established.

The performance of "Huanghuagang" mobilized all the drama groups, and hundreds of people enthusiastically participated in the work. There was no distinction between this border and that border, and there was no thought of the importance of interests. Everyone only had a passionate and heroic heart to seek liberation for the motherland! This is an unprecedented phenomenon and a glorious monument to the drama community's efforts to resist the war and the drama movement!

We must remember this new stage of the drama: choosing scripts that can match the current political situation, concentrating all the workers to perform, striving for the practice of popularization, so that the artistic effectiveness and political effectiveness are organically and uniformly instilled in the people and the public, and the result of the performance directly contributes to the relief of the suffering compatriots, or strengthens the manpower and material resources of national salvation: this is the characteristic of the current stage of the Hong Kong drama movement, and it is also the right path that should be set for the drama work in the second phase of the War of Resistance.

### Tentative Essay on Realism in Film

— Jie Ru

Realism is a creative method that permeates all artistic fields. It represents the pinnacle of creative methods attainable in artistic activities and creative practices since the beginning of human history. It is the highest stage in the development of artistic techniques throughout human history, guiding all writers to truthfully reflect and express reality. It leads writers to discover and create complete art forms. It is the most powerful approach to objectively and truthfully depicting "typical characters in typical environments." By grasping it, writers can deeply approach objective reality, discover and correct errors in their worldviews. This method of realism is the highest comprehensive and critical achievement of the entire history of human art. It not only exists in all artistic fields outside of film today, but it also penetrates film art with an extraordinary force.

Film, this most modern art form, has unlimited adaptability and need for modern realism. Film art itself is a product of the era of highly developed science and technology in human society. On the one hand, it organically integrates the positive elements of various artistic fields of mankind. On the other hand, it possesses its own unique technical (mechanical) characteristics, thereby establishing its complete form through the mutual exchange and combination of general artistic elements and special technical conditions. This form carries a strong sense of complete comprehensiveness, novelty, imagery, and mass appeal. Undoubtedly, such a form is only suitable for applying realism, and only under the guidance of the creative method of realism can it achieve its development and success. Realism, as a superior guiding force and as the basic method of film creation, gives film artistic depth and refinement, making it a complete art form and endowing it with realistic artistic content. Therefore, realism is an organic component that deeply enters film art and becomes the main life of film art.

Realism in film is sufficient to produce a completely decisive effect on the entire film creation process. On the one hand, it guides filmmakers to recognize reality, leading them to grasp the fundamental things from complex reality, and dominating the cognitive process of film production. On the other hand, it also guides filmmakers to express reality, influencing their techniques, methods, and styles, enabling film art to truthfully reflect objective reality in the most sound, perfect, and clear image, dominating the expression process of film production. However, this decisive power of realism for film is completely the same as the power it can exert on other artistic fields. This is originally the common function of realism on all artistic departments, not unique to film art. If we want to understand the basic characteristics of realism in film art, we must explore the essence of film.

The special characteristic of realism in film exists in the essence of film art. Film art is an organic synthesis of general artistic factors and special technical conditions. From the perspective of being a synthesis of all arts, film has not only images, but also colors and sounds. These images, colors, and sounds are the basic tools for film to reflect objective reality. However, if the images, colors, and sounds of film are only used as copies of realistic images, colors, and sounds, then it loses its special and independent artistic significance. The images, colors, and sounds in film art should not only be copies of reality, but should be a new creation of realistic images, colors, and sounds. The special characteristic of realism in film lies in executing this creative work of reality through the organic application of special film techniques. Realism must use its superiority in creative methods, cooperate with the special nature of film technology, to implement this creation, so that the positive elements contained in various artistic fields of mankind, and the special technical characteristics unique to film art itself, can obtain new cooperation and new integration on the basis of new creation. This is the basic characteristic of realism in film.

Film is an emerging, vigorous, and young art. It is a tender sprout rooted in the modern accumulation of highly developed culture. Only by obtaining the nourishment of the realistic creative method, which is also one of the accumulations of human culture, can it bloom beautiful flowers. Today, in order to endow film art with a more beautiful and complete form, and in order to make the creation of film art achieve overall success, filmmakers must strive to grasp new realism from their own artistic practice and the improvement of their artistic cultivation. Suddenly urged in the evening of April 26th.

### Active Struggle in the Motherland - The Dongjiang Mobile Opera Troupe

— Zhu Baishui

In the faint light of a dawn at the end of the previous two months, the Guangzhou-Kowloon train dragged a dozen young workers away, leaving the lewd Hong Kong Island and rushing into the embrace of the motherland full of flames of war.

A green velvet flag fluttered in the high sky, brightly embroidered with "Dongjiang Mobile Opera Troupe."

They were originally a group of service teams returning to the Dongjiang area to carry out anti-Japanese propaganda and organize the people. They took the form of songs and dramas as the central work, cooperated with all the strength and skills of a propaganda team, and carried out mobile propaganda work.

Obviously, after the first invasion of Dongjiang by the × people and their subsequent defeat, what was left behind was broken tiles and rubble and cruel and painful memories. Now, the × people are preparing for a second invasion conspiracy. Therefore, under the urgent call to defend Dongjiang, strengthening the organization of the people and the education of the people is urgently needed.

The "Dongjiang Overseas Chinese Returning Home Service Corps" organized by overseas Chinese in the Dongjiang area has established sub-groups in various counties and districts, and in a very short period of time, it organized a mobile singing and drama troupe to work in various parts of Dongjiang.

The "Dongjiang Mobile Opera Troupe" thus departed from Hong Kong on February 11.

...Courageously traversing the abdomen of the Dongjiang

Starting from losing the train in Shenzhen, a long trek began towards Pingshan. They arrived at Pingshan Market on the same day and were warmly welcomed by the Pingshan Guerrilla Area. After working there for three days, they moved to Danshui. This kind of movement allowed them to bravely traverse the abdomen of the Dongjiang in two months!

Starting from Pingshan, passing through Danshui, Zhoutian, Shuangtian, Maxixi, Liangjing, Pingshan, Sanduozhu, Chishi, Xiagang, Meilong, and finally reaching Haiyan County, and reaching Haifeng County.

What a long and arduous march this is!

In this long journey, they exerted the highest degree of singing and drama. Especially the effect of the latter was very successful. Every time they arrived at a place, they performed dramas to carry out propaganda and improve the people's awareness and enthusiasm for the Anti-Japanese War.

The best impressions gained along the way were Pingshan, Danshui, Zhoutian Shuangtian and Maxixi. These places have been harassed by the × people or bombed by × planes. Therefore, the people have a very clear understanding of the × people, and propaganda is easy to do, and work is easy to achieve results.

Especially Pingshan and Zhoutian are better. The Huibao People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Team is doing a good job in Pingshan. The people's awareness is very high, and Zhoutian has a relatively high level of culture, and the people's enthusiasm for the Anti-Japanese War is also very high. The Anti-Enemy Comrades Group organized there has already had more than 500 people participating, and women account for a particularly large number, and the future is very promising.

However, passing through places such as Sanduozhu showed that it was not as good. Taking Sanduozhu as an example, the people there have very little awareness of the Anti-Japanese War, and the concept of clan is also very strong. In particular, the "fear of Japan disease" is very widely spread. In the current stage of the Anti-Japanese War, it is very bad that this phenomenon is still spreading in the vast rural areas. This clearly points out that our people's mobilization is not enough, and we still need to urgently work!

...Igniting the flames of the Anti-Japanese War in Haifeng City

Haifeng County is a relatively large county in Dongjiang. In the era of revolution, it had experienced the baptism and training of the great era. However, precisely because of this, it now stubbornly inherits the old forces that can hinder the development of the new Anti-Japanese War situation.

However, when the Dongjiang Mobile Opera Troupe arrived in this ancient county on March 13, it bravely ignited a fiery flame of the Anti-Japanese War.

After contacting and liaising with the local government and various people's organizations, they immediately began work in various aspects. On the evening of the 31st, at the invitation of the party department, they participated in the performance of the "Haifeng All Circles Performing Arts Raising Funds for the Frontline Soldiers' Shoes and Socks Conference." The repertoire included "Blood Sprinkled on the Sentimental Sky," "Seeking Survival from Death," "Poison Noodles," and "Song of the Night," as well as the Haiping Middle School singing team, and the county-run No. 2 Elementary School children's drama "Memorial Hall," etc., and the results were very good.

Later, they performed "Those Who Have Strength Contribute Strength," "Seeking Survival from Death," and "Under the Sun Flag" at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall, and also held street lectures, a one-cent movement, and other work. Then, at the invitation of the local Second District and Fourth District, they went to those places to carry out patrol work, responsible for drama guidance and people's organization, and in a very short period of time, they set off the anti-Japanese wave at the bottom of Haiyan with the greatest strength.

Recently, it is planned to jointly perform "Thunderstorm" and "Defend Lugou Bridge" with local groups such as the "Weiming Drama Club," "Youth Anti-Japanese Comrades Association," and "Women's Association," and the proceeds will be used to establish a drama association, which is very important for the Haifeng National Salvation Drama Movement.

...A stronger struggle on the land of the motherland

In the two months of struggle, they deeply realized the importance of their responsibilities and felt that the vast work needed to be strengthened and developed. Therefore, the original partners were not enough, so the troupe sent people back to Hong Kong to supplement and increase new members.

The reporter met yesterday with Chen Yimin, the political instructor responsible for supplementing the troupe members on this trip back to Hong Kong, and learned in detail about the troupe's work process. He also talked about the urgent need for young workers to return to work not only in one place but everywhere. In fact, the vast masses of people need us to organize and educate them, especially in the final struggle of one person's dying gasp, it is urgent to mobilize the people to defend their hometowns!

How important is this precious and urgent call to the young workers in Hong Kong!

This time back to Hong Kong, five new young partners were found in a very short period of time to participate, two women and three men, all of whom were very capable and had great work enthusiasm in drama and singing. These new fighters will make their struggle stronger and more active on the land of the motherland!

Now, they have embarked on a new journey again and left Hong Kong by sailboat to Haiyan, and will work more fully in Haiyan for a month, and then move to Heyuan, Zijin and other counties for mobile and patrol work, hoping to travel all over the upper and lower reaches of Dongjiang.

Bless them: Struggle forever in the embrace of the motherland full of flames of war.

### An Unprecedented Grand Alliance of Hong Kong's Drama Circles - The Public Performance of "Huanghuagang" is Approaching

— Huo Xi

——Starting May 3rd at the Taiping Theater——

"Use hot blood to irrigate the flower of freedom, and build the triumphal arch with white bones." Without "March 29th," how could there be "October 10th"; without the foundation of the Republic of China, how could there be this national war of resistance; without this national war of resistance, how could there be a victorious tomorrow! In today's intense war of resistance, with victory in sight, it is time to sing the spirit of the martyrs who sacrificed themselves to become benevolent and leave a lasting reputation; to raise funds to comfort the families of the fallen generals and soldiers in the war of resistance to comfort the martyrs under the nine springs - this should be a great and righteous act!

Recently, the Hong Kong All Circles Relief Federation for South China Refugees, in order to comfort the families of the fallen generals and soldiers, specially invited all Hong Kong drama groups to hold a joint grand performance. The script for this fund-raising performance happens to be "Huanghuagang." The completion of this script is the collective creation of more than 20 progressive dramatists, an unprecedented achievement in the drama circles. It vividly presents the most tragic and greatest historical sites of the Chinese nation on the stage.

This fund-raising performance is a union of more than 40 drama groups, mobilizing more than 300 people backstage and front stage, fully demonstrating the unprecedented unity of the Hong Kong drama circles. The Hong Kong All Circles Relief Federation's active preparation and enthusiastic hard work are also writing a glorious page in the history of Hong Kong's overseas Chinese.

"Huanghuagang" was originally scheduled to be performed on the Huanghua Festival; however, due to insufficient preparation and careful arrangements, it was decided to be performed at the Taiping Theater for three consecutive days starting on May 3rd. This can symbolize even more that although the yellow flowers have fallen, we will never forget the merits of the martyrs.

The directing team of "Huanghuagang" consists of Ouyang Yuqian, Hu Chunbing, Zhong Qinan, Huang Chanlin, Lu Dun, Tan Guochi and other pioneers of the drama movement. They have been actively rehearsing for a month, and the future performance is expected to be amazing.

The Special Committee for the Huanghuagang Performance of the Relief Federation has been actively preparing these days, and the work has already begun to take shape. The only problem now is waiting for us to recognize and sell admission tickets and help sell admission tickets. The ticket prices are set at five yuan, three yuan, one yuan, and three jiao, four kinds, can we still refuse to do our best? The martyrs shed blood, the actors and workers sweat, but we appreciate the most advanced dramatic art and receive the most revolutionary baptism, is there still any reluctance?

It must also be remembered; the funds raised from this charity performance are to comfort the families of the fallen generals and soldiers in the war of resistance!

(Editor's note: A special issue of "Huanghuagang" will be published on May 3rd, the day of the performance. Readers are requested to pay attention.)

### Seven Hundred and Forty-One Performances

— Wang Ying

The First Performance After the Bombing—in Xuzhou

It was early autumn, and the yellow sand of Xuzhou filled the sky. The pulley cars rolled on and on, unfolding a kind of northern charm. The climate was particularly hot, and the streets and alleys were filled with shuttling people, bustling and bustling. From time to time, groups of armed brothers, political workers, and self-defense forces passed through solemnly. Large white-character slogans were posted everywhere on the earthen walls; the air of war had permeated this ancient city.

At the station, the armed brothers questioned us very carefully. When they saw the passport given to us by the military authorities, they let us pass through very kindly.

"The front line is fighting well, right? We can't retreat this time, damn ×× devils!" He said with a smile and straightforwardness, and the yellow hand grenade stood out vividly on the gray military uniform.

Out of the main road, the comrades of the People's Education Museum came to greet us hand in hand. A small newly built auditorium in the museum can accommodate 500 people. We lived in two rooms behind the auditorium. They were busy fetching water, pouring tea, and exchanging greetings; we were busy telling them about our departure, asking about the situation of the mass movement in Xuzhou, and the work we planned to do after arriving in Xuzhou.

"Very good, very good," said the curator, Zhao Jun. "This place needs you very much. Your arrival will definitely have a significant impact on the intellectuals and the masses."

"Regarding the audience, we entrust you completely to arrange the viewing of the show"; we said: "Because we are not familiar with the situation in Xuzhou. Our principles are one, not selling tickets, and two, not soliciting donations."

"How can it work not selling tickets?" Zhao Jun continued, "The venue is small, wouldn't it be unable to accommodate many people?"

We have always performed in two ways, one is on the stage, and the other is on the street. When performing in the auditorium, please print some tickets and distribute them.

This is how we decided on our performance in Xuzhou.

Near evening, the setting sun shone on the flower garden of the Education Museum, and the red flowers and white flowers looked even softer. The air was very quiet, and suddenly there was a very heavy and turbid roar in the distant sky, "What is this?" We stopped the rehearsal work and asked a comrade from the Education Museum next to us. "This is a bullock cart," he replied. When we first arrived in Xuzhou, we didn't quite understand what the sound of a bullock cart was like.

We continued to rehearse the play, and another group of comrades practiced singing, preparing for the evening broadcast. But in less than two minutes, six heavy bombers came towards us with their teeth and claws. Everyone looked up, pondering in their hearts: "This sound is unreliable, it's the × people!" Before we had time to think further, bullets rained down like rain; the high-shooting machine gunner in gray hurried to the position, and the woman ran around with her child in her arms. "Don't walk, lie down quickly!" Our comrades lying in the flower bushes shouted. "I'm the one who fires the machine gun"; the brothers in gray immediately exerted their firepower in the position inside the earthen slope.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Oh! Oh no, why are we lying next to the machine gun position! But, there's no way, we had to lie there motionless, shrapnel, fireballs, and mud, flying past us. Not far away, there was an deafening crashing sound from the top of a mountain. This aimless massacre continued for 20 minutes, and then the aerial bandits adorned with ugly sun symbols finally fled under the power of our machine guns.

The sky gradually darkened, and the assembly bugle from the North Station sent a clear message to everyone's ears. The fire brigade's whistle screamed loudly, and six trains safely left. The main purpose of the × planes was to bomb our train (the train was full of armed brothers heading to the front), but they dropped all the bombs on Zifang Mountain, destroying the house of the engineer living on the top of the mountain and his entire family, leaving only the elderly engineer alive and miserable. But later, the blood of his beloved family enabled him to exert an active and unimaginable efficacy in the work of the Longhai Road.

The alarm personnel of the Sili were immediately dismissed.

At night, there were no electric lights, no moon, no stars in the whole city. Patches of dark clouds moved in the sky, and the alarm was issued sharply twice in a row. The people were exceptionally awake and calm; they quietly walked to the air-raid shelter in the dark. One after another, we groped in the dark on the wet grass and walked into the small air-raid shelter built by the Education Museum. The comrades from the Education Museum were already there. At this time, we discussed the work in detail and decided to invite people from all walks of life to the auditorium the next night. The play was our collective creation, and the "Defend the Ancestral Country" was performed using the method of a living report.

### Film and Drama Information - Anti-Japanese Special Collection Six Episodes - Screening to Entertain the Cultural Circles - Morning of May 5th at the Cathay Theater -

The anti-Japanese documentary film "Anti-Japanese Special Subject" produced by the Political Department of the Military Commission and exported by the China Film Studio, from the first episode to the fifth episode, has been shown in Hong Kong and has received unprecedented praise. Under the ardent desire of thousands of overseas Chinese, the good news that the sixth episode has been completed and connected to Hong Kong has also spread to the ears of overseas Chinese. The sixth episode includes the victory of De'an, a final glimpse of Guangzhou and Wuhan during the retreat, the Nanyue Conference convened by Chairman Chiang to decide on the second phase of the Anti-Japanese War, as well as frontline generals from the east, west, north and south battlefields, such as Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Xue Yue, and Shang Zhen, all of whom are filmed on the screen. This is a film with rich content and great value, and this journal has solemnly recommended it in the previous issue. Now, the Liaison Office of the Hong Kong Members of the National Literary Association has specifically set the morning of May 5th at 10 o'clock at the Cathay Theater to entertain the cultural circles of Hong Kong to appreciate this rare anti-Japanese film.

"A Year" will be performed

Xia Yan is now convening the Performance Committee

Xia Yan, editor-in-chief of the National Salvation Daily and a playwright, has made many contributions to the national salvation drama movement in Hong Kong since his arrival. Recently, he plans to call on playwrights in Hong Kong to jointly perform his latest masterpiece "A Year" in order to raise funds for cultural undertakings in China. This matter was once used to entertain famous directors and actors in Hong Kong to discuss the performance. The Performance Committee was immediately established.

### First Division Football Championship Runner-up Battle: Eastern Club Defeats Navy, 3-2 Victory Ascends to Second Place, Among the Three Shanghai Players, Cao Qiuting is the Most Outstanding

[Our Correspondent] Yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock at Caroline Hill, the stands were packed with people, both Chinese and Western, numbering over half a myriad, making it the most popular match since the Eastern football team was promoted to the First Division.

This competition was of great importance, concerning the runner-up spot in the First Division League, to be decided here. If Eastern were to win, it would complete the feat of our Chinese teams taking both the championship and runner-up positions.

"Poverty reveals ambition, urgency reveals drama." Eastern indirectly created an opportunity thanks to South China, leading to this runner-up battle. Sure enough, united as one, victory was the goal. Despite the fact that many key players were injured after returning from the South, they fought bravely against the well-rested Navy, winning the battle and ascending to "second place."

In my opinion, Eastern's victory yesterday was entirely based on the success of strengthening the forward line. If the lineup had not been adjusted at the last minute, and had played as published in the newspaper, I fear it would not have achieved this result.

Xu Jingcheng and Liu Shizan performed extremely swiftly and logically. Although their positions were not ideally suited, their rapid running and daring, both in the back and suddenly in the front, were enough to compensate for any shortcomings. They rarely made mistakes, advanced and retreated in unison, and coordinated well, thus achieving the effect of communication.

Among the Eastern players, the three Shanghai players attracted the most attention. Therefore, it is worth describing how they performed. Right midfielder Jiang Shanqing can be described as having solid skills, not losing the demeanor of a famous general. However, his movements were slightly slow, which may be due to being away from football for too long. The second goal conceded in the second half and the major scare in the last second were both caused by Lao Jiang not being able to contain Morris, leading to a crisis. However, this is not solely Lao Jiang's responsibility, but he was the one who bore the brunt.

Xu Wenkui played as the right inside forward in the first half, and then switched with Yu Qiaxing in the second half. It seemed that Lao Xu's movements were very slow. He often lightly lost balls that he should not have missed to the opposing defender, and he was not good at sprinting. However, his passing was quite accurate, which was the only good thing we saw from him yesterday.

Left winger Cao Qiuting performed outstandingly, being the number one player in the forward line. His shots were powerful and his attacks were fast. The Navy defenders, Nigro and Collinson, had headaches when they encountered him and could not stop him. However, because he was good at seizing opportunities to advance, he often committed offsides, just like Hou Chengtang.

Eastern's first and second goals were unexpected gains and were quite lucky. The third goal was shot clearly and delicately, so his battle功 was half due to luck and half due to human effort.

Throughout the match, the most commendable act was Xu Heng's heroic effort in the last second, which can be described as a miraculous feat of saving the day. If he had failed, the game would have had to go into overtime, and then Eastern's runner-up position might have been lost due to the overtime. Therefore, Lao Xu's action was not only a great personal achievement, but more importantly, it maintained Eastern's glory.

The biggest reason for the Navy's failure was that goalkeeper Jashin's performance was abnormal. He must bear some responsibility for the first and second goals conceded. Secondly, the forwards were not good at shooting, and the team's overall performance was not as brilliant as it was in the match against South China last week. They only achieved an average level against Eastern, and it can be said that they were evenly matched. Therefore, Eastern's victory was not accidental.

After the two teams lined up, the battle began. Shi Zuan sent the ball to Deqi, and Xandi intercepted it and cleared the ball out of danger. Armstrong launched a counterattack, forcing a corner kick, which Tobin intercepted and cleared.

After four minutes, Armstrong passed the ball to Tobin on the wing, who approached and shot, grazing past the goal. Morse was too late to catch up, and Shizan forcefully pushed it out of bounds.

After five minutes, Eastern mobilized its entire army, and Deqi attacked. Wenkui supported from the middle, but he could not lift his foot near the goal and passed it to Bingtu, who fell to the ground, losing the opportunity.

From then on, the two sides went back and forth, like a tug-of-war, and the battle was quite spectacular.

At the 32nd minute, the Navy took the offensive. Weiquan kicked the ball back to his own half to save the urgent situation, but Tobin rushed in, which was very dangerous. Fortunately, Zhongyun's foot was skillful and sent the ball out. Deqi regained possession in the midfield, drew his bow, and advanced. From about 20 yards in front of the goal, he launched a cold arrow. The ball rolled in, and everyone thought it had gone out of bounds. Jashin also did not pay attention to it and treated it lightly. By the time the ball crashed into the net, Jashin was unable to save it. 1-0, Eastern took the lead.

The Navy, having lost first, was thinking of revenge. At the 34th minute, Armstrong was seen attacking, shooting from the side of the goal line with great urgency. Fortunately, Xu Heng hugged the ball tightly, and nothing happened. Soon after, the first half ended.

Five minutes into the second half, Bingtu quickly broke through and passed a wonderful ball. Wenkui was one step too late and was cleared by Xandi. Jingcheng intercepted the ball in the middle and slowly advanced, pretending to choose someone to pass to. While the Navy defense was slightly careless, he kicked fiercely with his left foot from 40 yards away. The ball left the ground by about one foot and flew into the Navy's goal like a cannonball. Jashin was helpless, stunned and错愕. The score became 2-0, and Eastern won again.

At the 15th minute, Armstrong 활團 defended the wing, passing and maneuvering with Tobin. They reached Eastern's territory. Tobin crossed from the goal line, but the Eastern defense could not stop them. Armstrong slanted out to fill Tobin's empty position. Watching the ball come down from above, he rushed to抢夺, and with the ball, crashed into the net. 1-2, the Navy reduced the deficit.

At the 20th minute, Bingtu, with the help of Wenkui and Deqi's transportation, cut into the middle on the wing. The ball fell to the corner of the Navy's goal. Qiushi arrived in time and, from a few feet away from the side of the goal, aimed at the goal line and shot fiercely into the net. 3-1, stabilizing the victory.

At the 33rd minute, the Navy's offensive was very strong. Eight armies advanced deep into Eastern's territory, doing their best to harass. Finally, center forward Morris 近射 scored, making the score 2-3.

The center circle reopened, and the Navy still took the offensive. Eastern worked hard to defend, and it was extremely thrilling. In the last second, Morris saw the ball and rushed forward. Shanqing did not watch him closely and was passed. At this point, Xu Heng was defending the isolated city, like a prisoner awaiting judgment. Fortunately, when Morris raised his foot to shoot, "Brother Heng" happened to hold the ball up with both hands, lifting the ball high and sending it out of the goal. He escaped this great disaster. It was truly fortunate, and before the Navy could take a corner kick, the ceasefire signal had already sounded. Eastern finally won 3-2,榮居 runner-up. The battle generals on both sides are as follows:

### Pui Ying Performs Excellently, Still Loses to South China, Great China Police Victory in Second Division

In the Open Men's Basketball Tournament, in the first match last night, Great China of the Second Division faced Hong Yuen. In the first half, Great China was forced to fall behind. As a result, they only narrowly defeated Hong Yuen by 30 to 28. In the second match, South China of the First Division faced Pui Ying. Since the start of the tournament, the former had only lost once to South China, and its record was unmatched. However, in yesterday's match against Pui Ying, under stubborn resistance, they forced a tie twice. At the end of the first half, they also only narrowly lost by 20 to 22. Unfortunately, Pui Ying did not have enough stamina, and in the second half, they fell further and further behind. As a result, they were eventually defeated by South China by 56 to 34. However, Pui Ying's defeat was not due to a lack of effort. The excellent performance of each player was unprecedented. Lin Wanli and Pan Jinhong attacked from the flanks, and with their agile turns, they were often able to break through the enemy's defense. Although their shots were not always accurate, they were much better than before. Center Li Lianze charged into the enemy's lines and was unstoppable, repeatedly posing a threat to the opponent. Qiu Yingbian and He Rirong firmly guarded the rear, and were often able to intercept the opponent's passes. It was unwise to舍何 and use Liu Zemin. Soon after entering the game, he suffered several球數次. On the other hand, South China's forwards, Chen Xinqiu and Xiao Jiemin, made the most contributions. Xinqiu repeatedly used rotating positions to lie伏于 under the enemy's basket, and his shots were as quick as lightning. Jiemin, on the other hand, made even more outstanding plays. Although Pui Ying was strong, they were ultimately no match for their skillful passing. Shi Zhenzhi was originally South China's shooter, but he performed poorly in the match, so Xiao Chen had to make the contributions. South China later used Zheng Wokun and Qian Jinghui one after another, but they were not outstanding. As for the defenders Lu En and Shi Zhenda, they often went straight to the enemy's basket alone and made many contributions, but the rear was empty, and at the same time, they gave Pui Ying the opportunity to attack. Although South China wanted to 回師, it was too late. In the first half, South China was forced to tie twice, one reason being that the attack was too rushed. After adjusting the lineup in the second half, the attack and defense were much more meticulous, so they were able to gain the upper hand. After the two sides exchanged blows, Lu En of South China opened the scoring. Shi Zhenda followed with a long shot, and Shi Zhenzhi again hung the ball in with a backhand. Pui Ying only recovered three points through Lin Wanli. South China took the lead with 8-3. As soon as Qiu Guangxie shot and fouled, Wanli and Lianze successively made contributions, and they followed closely with 9-10. Subsequently, they tied the score at 16-16. Shortly after, Chen Xinqiu of South China托入 the basket at the bottom, and Shi Zhenda侧击 from the side of the court. Wanli and Jinhong of Pui Ying were not to be outdone and also recovered their scores. At the end of the first half, South China占先 by 20 to 20. After changing baskets, they again drew level with 10 to 20. By the time Xinqiu of South China entered the basket to unleash his might, the score became 36-26 and 40-28. Pui Ying fell further and further behind. Afterwards, Xinqiu's锐气稍挫, but Zhenzhi and Jiemin again露头角, and they won again with 49-34. Until the end of the game, Pui Ying was eventually defeated by South China by 34-56. In the last match, the Second Division Police faced Qingzhi. The two sides fought fiercely. As a result, the Police won by 41-34.

### Women Under Oppression

— Luoxia

"Do you think that these guys who exploit and oppress us in this way will have a good end?" Two pale-faced girls cursed as they stumbled downstairs, trembling so much that they could barely stand. What a tragic scene!

They were girls selling ice cream. Because they fled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong, they could not endure the hardships of hunger and cold, so they took on this public-facing job on small steamers. The price they received each month was only ten dollars, and the working hours each day often exceeded nine hours. They also had to pay a deposit of five dollars and sign a six-month contract. In order to survive, no matter how difficult it was, they had to endure it. However, the boss was not satisfied with these harsh conditions and suddenly changed the employment system to a contract system. That is, the daily salary of thirty-three cents was changed to a commission of half a cent for every dollar's worth of goods sold, and the working hours were extended to more than eleven hours. This is something that an ordinary person cannot endure. Therefore, these two girls resolutely objected. After many quarrels, they finally managed to get back the seven-tenths discount on their deposits, but there were still dozens of girls who were in the same situation of oppression, without the conditions or ability to resist, and continued to be exploited.

How can they survive on a 毛錢 commission per dollar? Some people may be surprised to ask? In fact, there are too many similar incidents. A female worker in a weaving factory or flashlight factory often only earns half a 毛錢 to one and a half 毛錢 a day. If you work overtime, you get an extra half 毛錢. If the business is good and the orders are crowded, then you get one and a half 毛錢, and you have to work all night. After a few days of working all night, the boss will very kindly give you a few days of rest, but there is no salary during the rest period!

As times continue to evolve, the methods by which capitalists exploit hard-working workers are also constantly changing. They initially took advantage of the low wages of female workers, employing them with wages that were barely enough for them to live on. Later, in order to increase production, they adopted the contract system, which gave these female workers the idea of earning a little more money, and they命的 and worked with him. Finally, the capitalists felt that this contract system was not profitable enough, so they reverted to the employment system, employing these female workers with the lowest wages. Is this low wage enough to pay for housing and food? However, millions of miserable female compatriots continue to live like this. And many, many people are looking at the factory gates with envious eyes!

Hunger never forgives anyone for even half a second. In order to survive, in order for her whole family to live, if they have no work, they will only run on the last road,通 their lives to sell their flesh. Look at the prostitutes that are everywhere, and those escort agencies that are like stars in the sky? Where do these come from! In order to整饬市政 and prevent the spread of venereal diseases, the Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly reiterated the ban on suppressing secret prostitution and considering the abolition of escort agencies. However, the conclusion reached is that "starvation" and "prostitution" are only separated by a line. Therefore, the problem of "private prostitutes" is not a question of whether to eliminate them or not, but whether we want them to continue to live or not.

We are not saying that private prostitutes can never be eliminated. How to eliminate them? It is to enable everyone to have work and everyone to have food to eat. Now, the Labour Group of the YWCA is paying close attention to the problems of female workers. Setting up night schools to actively educate and train them is an important issue. However, there are no concrete measures to improve their lives. Of course, this is not an easy problem to solve. It requires the active assistance of the authorities and the combined efforts of enthusiastic people from all walks of life to achieve practical results!

The female compatriots who were liberated from the shackles of feudalism encountered this terrible oppression by capitalists. Therefore, female compatriots in the future must be more觉预起來, to relieve all玄 compatriots from the pain of being 壓炸!

### Three Many

— Qianli

"Three Many" is the standard of living that most people desire, at least most Chinese people think so. Places like Hong Kong are currently gathering places for the wealthy, and the practice of polygamy is also very prevalent. There must be many people enjoying this "Three Many" blessing. However, the "Three Many" I am talking about here is not the three blessings of abundant fortune, long life, and many sons. On the contrary, it is the dark side of life.

That is: many cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, many prostitutes, and many thieves.

According to a recent report from the Hong Kong Department of Health, an average of more than 150 new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis occur every week, and about 100 people die from it each week. A total of 52 weeks in a year, according to the report of the Department of Health, no less than 5,000 people suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis each year. This alarming number has forced the Hong Kong Department of Health to include it in the list of current diseases, and the public cannot help but feel uneasy. As a result, some people believe that such rampant situation is caused by ignorant people spitting everywhere, or they blame citizens for not knowing hygiene.

I think these gentlemen's opinions are very insightful, but in today's Hong Kong, where rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, and every inch of land is worth its weight in gold, how can ordinary middle and lower-class citizens, who are crowded into an apartment that can only accommodate a small family with three or four dozen people, talk about hygiene? This is something that deserves our attention. Moreover, according to the announcement of medical doctors such as those from Japan, the number of people suffering from lung disease in × country every year is no less than one million, and the number of deaths is also tens of thousands. The reason, it is said, is due to "lack of nutrition." It seems that the pulmonary tuberculosis in Hong Kong may not be unrelated to this aspect.

Secondly, the number of prostitutes is also very high. According to the report of the Salvation Army Commander, Mr. Burke Rice, at the Hong Kong Salvation Army Annual Meeting last month, more than 25,000 women in Hong Kong are forced to engage in prostitution due to economic circumstances, including many underage girls. In a city with a population of about one million, the number of prostitutes has reached such a figure, which is really surprising. Assuming that women account for half of the million people, the total is only 500,000. After excluding girls and old women, even if we assume that the age suitable for being a prostitute is from fifteen to forty years old, it is at most only half, that is, 250,000 people. Think about it, more than 25,000 out of 250,000 are prostitutes. Doesn't that mean that one out of every ten women of suitable age is a prostitute? What kind of ratio is this? I simply dare not think about it anymore.

In short, many, many, many, so many that it makes moralists cry out, and makes those men who have always looked down on women very proud. However, if you compare it with the recent robbery and theft cases, I am afraid it will still be insignificant.

Just open a corner of the newspaper and take a look, and you will immediately find that there is robbery there, and there is robbery there. Here someone is picking pockets, and there someone is picking pockets. Go to any public place or post office or boat station, and you will immediately see a few very eye-catching words: "Beware of pickpockets!" Otherwise, just run around on the street, and you can easily see some children snatching cigarettes, or stealing things from grocery stores or candy stalls. People call these "worthless" children "child bandits."

Alas, in addition to "child bandits," there are "child prostitutes," and in addition to child prostitutes, there are "child tuberculosis." These are the three major characteristics of Hong Kong. And the many thieves, the many prostitutes, and the many tuberculosis have become the "Three Many" of Hong Kong.

How to eliminate these "Three Many"? Some people say that this is "the decline of morality," so we must start with morality. Others say that this is "poor education," so we must strive to educate the youth. Still others say that this is because citizens "do not pay attention to hygiene," which is why there are so many cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, so we must promote hygiene. Everyone's words are reasonable and logical, but I only remember an old saying, "Only when clothing and food are sufficient can one know shame." If clothing and food are insufficient and there is no way to make a living, it is impossible for citizens not to become prostitutes or thieves, and it is also impossible for citizens not to suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis.

Who would be willing to stand on the street in the middle of the night, braving the cold wind and rain, and soliciting love from strangers, suffering all kinds of insults? Who would be willing to risk their lives, full of fear, just for a few dollars? And who would not cherish their body, willing to eat food without nourishment in a dark and airless room, causing their body to weaken and easily contract pulmonary tuberculosis? No one, no one wants to do this. As long as every citizen has enough food and clothing, these unpleasant "Three Many" will disappear invisibly.

But in Hong Kong, can this be done? Let's not talk about anything else, just take the rent as an example. From last year to now, the average rent has risen a lot. Among them, the rents of various houses under the jurisdiction of a certain bank, the largest landlord in Hong Kong, have increased by an average of more than 100%, and some have even increased by 200% or 300%. In such a situation of rising rents, just the rent alone is enough to force the entire city to become prostitutes, thieves, or tuberculosis patients. And this unreasonable rent increase is not prohibited in Hong Kong. This is why Hong Kong has become a place of "Three Many."

### Breaking Free from Imprisonment

— Ding Di

"Time" is like a stream. From here, I trace it back to the dangerous rapids, where rocks cut off the water flow. Thus, old dreams are separated from me, and I forget the calm waves, the peaceful banks, the green mountains on the river, and the tranquility of the ferry crossing. The rapid sounds of the rapids fill my ears, and the cliffs rise thousands of feet from the ground, forming an insurmountable barrier, blocking the sunlight. All around is vast and desolate, and I am imprisoned in a dark, deep pool. Coming from "yesterday," there are still faint traces of disappearing waves. I touch them with questioning hands: does the dark, rapid stream firmly seal this light boat, making seclusion and darkness forever?

"There are no continuous rapids, no eternal dangers, and no endless imprisonment." As if stepping over the green of the mountains, someone's voice is reminding me.

Wandering in an isolated environment, situated on a lonely island, the life in a water country for six months is like the setting sun sinking into the sails at dusk. Riding a light boat, stagnant at the head of the rapids, protruding reefs are scattered like stars, isolating the old flowing water, making me lose warm memories. Even in these dangerous rapids, it is impossible to linger. I feel the threat of change - the imprisonment of time and space.

Silently enduring, watching the fallen leaves intertwine in the soil, seeking warmth and hiding in the quilt, it is clear that the seasons are telling me that things are changing. On the withered branches, one or two new green shoots sprout. "It should be the spring of growth!" We must open the lock of light cold and open up the vitality of life. Spring, the season of growth, we can no longer hide in silence, confined to imprisonment, restricted under the eaves, enduring tyranny, submitting to shackles, surrounded by traps, and obeying the whip.

"Spring, the season of growth," every sinew is wriggling like a silkworm crawling on a mulberry leaf. Gradually, I feel that the inner strength needs to erupt. Black streams, black mountains, and black skies surround me, making it impossible to break free. Therefore, I will drive my light boat, cut through the dangerous rapids, from the reefs, from the sobbing waves, from the weeping banks.

Who can endure this cruel imprisonment—no freedom, no wandering, no crying or laughing, no sun, no warmth, no growth.

The wild cries of thousands of families, the barbarian songs in several places, the footprints of life, rolling in a few feet of square earth, closely connected to the edge of death, are so close and simple. The prisoners in brown clothes and shaved heads are locked in darkness and cold, their eyes are ashamed to see the light, and their bodies are abnormally sluggish. "Time" locks the old days, and "time" also cuts off the distance.

The lingering dream that wakes up often cannot be believed on the pillow. A piece of spring light leaks from the stone wall of the sky. Then I remember: the light smoke on the lake, the willow catkins of the river city, the meditation room deep in flowers and trees, the "countable rain" in the mountains when picking tea——

When I yearn for the beauty of wandering, someone whispers in my ear again: There are no continuous rapids, no eternal dangers, no endless imprisonment.

Cross the dangerous streams, cross the rapid water, cross the deep pool. Black wind, black mountains, black sky, pass by both ears, retreat behind me. Try to move a step to change the shape, and I see the shadows and rosy clouds, the morning mist and the rising sun.

### The Art of Pushing

— Quanzhi

"The frost on his roof" can simply be "swept away by ten thousand brooms," which is great. However, "everyone should sweep the snow in front of their own door," which is a laborious task after all. So, it's not good not to sweep. What should we do? Well, you can "push" it to others: if you can't push it, you might as well learn how.

There are many ways to push: for example, if there is a house across the street, you can righteously announce to them that the snow is in front of their house and they should sweep it. If there is no house across the street, you can also confidently say to the left and right neighbors that the snow is near them and they should sweep it. If there are no neighbors on the left and right, you can even solemnly say to passersby that the snow is on the road they have walked and they should sweep it. If you can go a step further and prove that the snow fell because of these people, it will be even more justifiable to ask them to sweep it, making them have no choice but to obey. If you can go to the last step and prove that the snow was brought down by them, or brought by them from somewhere, then you can easily ask them to sweep it clean, achieving great success, and even if they die from sweeping, they can only die without complaint.

This method, "pushing" onto others, means pushing all the faults, mistakes, misfortunes, losses, and bad things onto others, while you are carefree, open and upright, and enjoy the fruits of their labor. How wonderful! Today, there are many great people with great careers, high positions, broad reputations, rich properties, and powerful influence, whether in the political, cultural, or business circles, or in any circle. A large part of the reason why they have reached this point is because they are proficient in this "push" principle.

When something comes into their hands, eyes, faces, or hearts, they never immediately deal with it. The first step is to see if it is beneficial to them. If it is not beneficial, they will "push" it away. They will not hesitate to use all their brains, spend all their thoughts, and exert all their energy to push this matter onto others, saying that it is not their responsibility. Even if it only requires a little brainpower, thought, or effort, saying that they can handle this matter, they are unwilling. They still have to push it away.

Of course, they are not born to be able to push, they learned it successfully. Maybe at first, they couldn't handle things without pushing, so-called "biting off more than you can chew." They learned this lesson, and since they are determined to establish their careers, they have no choice but to learn, to learn this "push." Over time, it becomes a habit, so there is no push that is not used, and no push that is not effective.

However, there are always exceptions: What if there is snow in front of your door, covering the ground, but there is no one to push it to, not even a passerby? Could it be that you really have to trouble yourself to sweep it in person? Well, you can still push it, push it to someone who doesn't exist, a Mr. Crow, a Ziluzi. In other words, all learning requires investment, which is never worthwhile. Since no one can be pushed for the responsibility of this snow, it is better to leave it there, ignore it, or pretend not to see it, let it melt by itself, let it freeze there. If you say that it is inconvenient to walk through the front door, you can simply go around the back door. If there is also snow on the back door, you can simply go through the side door, horizontal door, side door, or side door. There are many doors; you would rather put more effort into going around than to use a little effort to sweep, because one sweep will lose your dignity, will change your consistent policy, will destroy your unshakeable doctrine, and even if your shoes slip and your body falls, you will still not sweep, practicing your "push."

This kind of "push," when applied to all things, is procrastination. Pushing today to tomorrow, and pushing tomorrow to the day after tomorrow, and so on. If a bad thing turns into a small thing because of this "push," and a small thing turns into nothing, the pusher can congratulate himself on having foresight and avoiding disaster. If, because of the "push," nothing turns into a small thing, a small thing turns into a big thing, and a big thing is also unfavorable, he can also say, "Pushing is already like this, what would it be like if I didn't push?" Anyway, there are reasons for everything, and everything can be pushed.

This kind of pushing is also not something that can be achieved overnight. It also requires learning. Once learned, it is infinitely mysterious: it can avoid disasters, and it can turn bad luck into good fortune; at least to a limited extent, although there is no success, there is no failure either!

The above two kinds of pushing, the former is a "living push" that can be pushed away, and the latter is a "dead push" that cannot be pushed away. Combining the two, the art of pushing is almost complete.

Finally, we remember that there is also this "Confucius declined due to illness," which must also be learned. This is to tell lies, fabricate rumors, be shameless, and cheat people to death. When poor friends come to see you, you must pretend that you are not at home; when you have to serve as a soldier, you must pretend to be disabled; when you have to donate money, you must pretend to be poor; when you have to participate in patriotic movements, you must… have no time; if there is something in advance, you must pretend that it did not happen; when you are in a melon field, you must pretend to adjust your shoes, when you are under a plum tree, you must pretend to adjust your hat… Learning this push, you will have mastered the great achievements of the art of pushing, and you can be compared with Zai Yu, and be called the supreme sage in pushing!

However, when there is nothing to push, pushing the cart to a wall and getting your head broken is also a common occurrence. It seems that those who want to learn this also need to be careful.

### Fengchuan Estuary (Continued)

— Zhu Wenhui

Some people pulled a long rope tied to the mast, dragging it step by step on the riverbank. The bare arms exposed from their sweaty clothes were extraordinarily bright red and strong in the morning sun. Their swarthy faces showed a kind of farmer's loyal and resolute expression, a sense of struggle. Our hands and feet were covered in blue veins from years of labor, and there were wrinkles on our foreheads: these were obvious traces of the hardships of life.

However, they were happy. Whether young or old, whenever they had free time, they would hold a large bamboo pipe, smoking it puff by puff, talking about the trivial matters of the countryside or the stories of their ancestors, and sometimes they would also talk about love affairs between men and women. They also loved to sing folk songs. They were conservative about life. Therefore, they loved the fields even more than their own lives. Among these partners, there were a few who had lost their homes and wives due to the bombing of × machines and had come to the boat to do this hard work. They often told of their experiences with a tone of resentment. Sometimes they would treat it as just an unfortunate fate.

The river water was even more turbid, and the boat often ran aground on the silt. Beads of sweat dripped from the foreheads and foreheads of the partners. They were a bit exhausted, and the boat was moving very slowly. It wasn't until we saw smoke rising from the villages that our boat arrived at the Fengchuan Estuary. This was the last border of Fengchuan County. The villages were separated far apart. I looked as far as I could on the deck, and the shore was completely a field of tea-brown land after autumn. On the edge of the sky was a desolate mountain with overlapping peaks. The sun was almost hanging in the sky. Our boat had stopped completely at this estuary, preparing to start making breakfast.

### Snow in Manchuria

— Shuqun

He seemed to want to cheer her up, hoping to find some funny material for her. So he said:

"No—"

"What else do you want to eat?"

"I don't want to eat anything—"

Although he said this as a joke, it was also the reality for him and his comrades.

"Why?" Her thoughts were completely focused on her hypocritical smile. She immediately said again, "Tell me!"

"It's very simple, no money!"

"Where's your money?"

"We've never had much to begin with."

"Then this time you must get a lot from my family, enough to eat well!"

"This money cannot be eaten!"

"How so?"

He replied humorously…

"This money is not for food, it's for fun!"

"Is someone sick?" She asked with a naked heart, "Is it very serious?"

"Very serious, almost dead. Don't you know?"

"I don't know. Tell me. Who is it?"
