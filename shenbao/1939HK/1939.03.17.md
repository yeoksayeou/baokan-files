### Current Financial and Economic Issues: On the Achievements of the Second Local Financial Conference

Since the commencement of the second phase of the War of Resistance, new changes have taken place in military and political affairs. Financial and economic issues have been elevated to a critical stage. The most pressing difficulty to address is the tax revenue problem. In the past, China's annual income relied heavily on indirect taxes such as customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes, accounting for over 70% of the total annual income. However, since the War of Resistance, the successive fall of important ports and economic centers such as Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and Hankou, as well as the blockade or disruption of other ports, has hindered foreign trade, severely impacting customs revenue. Salt-producing areas like Changlu and Lianghuai have been occupied, resulting in significant losses in national salt tax revenue. The successive fall or disruption of coastal industrial centers has also led to a sharp decline in consolidated tax revenue. Second is the foreign exchange problem: In an attempt to undermine China's legal tender system, the Japanese established a puppet reserve bank to issue overseas Chinese currency, using it to absorb legal tender in exchange for foreign exchange. More recently, on the 15th of this month, they implemented a ban on the circulation of legal tender and enforced foreign exchange controls in occupied areas. Their various despicable methods to undermine our currency system and exacerbate our foreign exchange difficulties can be described as leaving no stone unturned. Third is the price problem: Since the successive loss of major trading ports, prices in various regions have undergone drastic scissor-like changes. On the one hand, the prices of all imported goods have skyrocketed; on the other hand, the prices of agricultural products have plummeted due to the inability to export them flexibly to other regions. Therefore, the adverse impact on the wartime national economy is incalculable. Furthermore, as a result of the development of the War of Resistance, transportation in various regions has become more difficult, and the country's financial economy, the people's economic livelihood, and production enterprises have all suffered considerable adverse impacts. These are extremely serious problems that urgently need to be resolved for the entire nation's War of Resistance and national reconstruction.

The Ministry of Finance convened the Second Local Financial Conference a few days ago. Its main task was to seek to strengthen local financial institutions, expand their business, and foster close cooperation between the central government and local authorities, in order to assist production enterprises, promote local financial strength, and adapt to the new needs of the new stage of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. The significance of seeking to resolve the financial and economic problems of the second phase of the War of Resistance cannot be ignored.

The conference closed on the 10th of this month and issued a declaration on the 15th. We express our utmost respect to the leadership spirit of the supreme leader and the financial authorities, as well as to the economic and financial leaders from all regions who, after receiving their orders, traveled to Chongqing for the meeting, regardless of distance or danger, to fulfill the duties of people from all walks of life during wartime. We also wish to express our views on the achievements of this conference and the expectations after the meeting for reference. The main theme of this financial conference was to address the important financial and economic problems at the current stage and to discuss plans to increase production, promote exports, balance prices, provide relief to the people, and develop resources. Furthermore, it explored the wartime financial and economic connections and cooperation with each other, in order to mobilize our country's financial resources, utilize the economic power of the entire nation, and crush the Japanese conspiracy to blockade the economy and undermine finance, in order to achieve the goal of winning the War of Resistance and building the nation. Based on the basic principles of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction Program and the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session and the Third Session of the People's Political Council, the conference, taking into account the specific environment and conditions of various regions, largely decided on concrete measures and formulated various plans for the original tasks. Among them, the following items are particularly noteworthy:

First, it was firmly recognized that "economic mobilization is a key factor in determining victory or defeat in modern warfare, and the sound organization and promotion of business of financial institutions are essential for strengthening the economy and striving for victory." Therefore, it was decided that all participants, upon returning to their respective regions, should do their best to promote local financial strength and economic development, that is, to concentrate the scattered economic forces of various regions to assist the central government in the success of various financial policies. Concrete decisions were also made on how to resist the use of Japanese puppet banknotes in the war zone, prevent the utilization of materials from the war zone, stabilize prices in areas outside the war zone, develop production enterprises, and concentrate the scattered gold and silver hidden among the people. Second, it was firmly recognized that "the prosperity and decline of the financial industry is a matter of overall interest: in the past, the financial industry in various regions may have focused solely on the interests of one province or one bank without paying attention to the overall situation, which was the main reason why the national financial and economic policies could not be implemented." Therefore, it was decided that the financial industry in various regions should henceforth uniformly follow the overall national policy, move towards the overall national economy, and provinces and the central government, provinces and provinces, and provinces and counties should further strengthen their ties, eliminate barriers, and work together. This can be said to be a major resolution for establishing a united anti-Japanese front in the financial sector. Third, it was firmly recognized that "to win economic victories in the rear of the Japanese, the first priority is to control the economic center of the war zone and consolidate the economic barrier of the war zone." Therefore, it was decided that financial operators in various regions must work together to ensure that the various industries operated by compatriots in the war zone can provide us with economic or financial convenience, and that materials in the war zone can be absorbed as much as possible for our exports, and that personnel needs can be fully met. Fourth, it was firmly recognized that the supreme leader's instruction that "the Japanese blockade of our economy is an opportunity for our economic revival" is the basic principle for national economic revival. It was also decided that the financial community in various regions should, with concerted efforts and continuous efforts, enable the inland economy to quickly revive through division of labor and cooperation in the shortest possible time, and that the mining, industrial, commercial and other industries should be provided with ample capital to improve their operations, so that the production enterprises in various sectors can achieve the greatest prosperity and the fastest growth under the economic conditions and economic environment that are most suitable for us now. In addition, the conference also clearly expressed two points in the declaration: First, regarding local finance, it was decided to sincerely follow the outline of measures to improve local financial institutions announced by the First Financial Conference, the measures to adjust local finance adopted by the Fifth Plenary Session, the various plans for the financial and economic handling of the war zone, and the resolutions of the Third Session of the National Political Council on finance and economy, and to work together to further implement them concretely. Second, regarding the acquisition of foreign assistance, it was decided that the financial institutions of each province and region should do their best and fulfill their duties, and work together under the principles advocated by the supreme leader and inspired by the central authorities, in order to obtain more cooperation from friendly countries, so that our economic revival can be even faster.

We firmly believe that after this financial conference, the financial and economic problems in our country's second phase of the War of Resistance will be resolved to a considerable extent. However, in order to thoroughly solve these problems and truly achieve the goal of mobilizing the entire nation's financial and economic power to serve the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, it seems that we should also require the people and the government to make greater efforts to realize the following points, namely: First, we must perfectly achieve the requirement of "those who have money contribute money," resolutely expand the income tax, implement the inheritance tax, and increase the tax rates on all luxury goods, while abolishing the harsh and miscellaneous taxes and the apportionment system, in order to ease the burden on the people and benefit tax revenue. Second, we must combine political mobilization with government decrees to expand the solicitation of public bonds and the donation movement, and mobilize the people to voluntarily donate money and grain to supply the anti-Japanese army and enrich financial revenue. The recent donation movement in Chongqing has achieved excellent results, especially among women, whose donations have been exceptionally enthusiastic. We believe that as long as the publicity is appropriate and the mobilization is good, this movement is a major force to help the country successfully implement its financial and economic policies in the future, so it should be promoted more widely under the unified leadership of the government, especially among overseas Chinese. Third, we must promote the thrift movement, especially focusing on improving the past corrupt lives of people above the middle class, limiting their waste, and presenting all their wasted money as donations to the nation. At the same time, we must pay attention to (1) vigorously practicing incorruptibility, revising the salary system, and stipulating an equal salary system according to the minimum living standard; (2) abolishing feudal and wasteful customs and improving social customs, not only to preserve vitality for the national finances, but also to establish a foundation for future national construction in advance. Fourth, we must step up international publicity and strive for foreign loans and other practical assistance. In addition, regarding the development of production and construction undertakings and the establishment of new economic centers, we believe that we still need to focus on the following points, namely: (1) National banks should expand the provision of low-interest loans to assist the development of production undertakings and the circulation of commodities; (2) continue to persist in the struggle to eliminate the Japanese policy of undermining the legal tender, and at the same time assist isolated areas in establishing local banks and issuing local paper money; (3) protect the free business of private industrial and commercial enterprises, and at the same time pay attention to the development of cooperative enterprises; (4) in the future, production undertakings should focus on national defense industries necessary for the War of Resistance and the industries of necessities for the people during wartime, and at the same time improve the labor law and factory management system to protect the material treatment of production workers, so as to ensure the practical improvement of productivity.

### Prospects for Foreign Investment in China

— Translated by Liang Chen

Translator's Note: The original author is Ner Man Hanwell, and the original article was published in "Asia Magazine" and reprinted by the Shanghai Miller's Review (Issue No. 9, January 28, 1939). The author believes that there are three possible outcomes of the Sino-Japanese War: the first is Japan's complete conquest of China. The author believes this is impossible; the second is a temporary armed truce after Japan occupies part of Chinese territory, but China will inevitably continue to resist until it recovers its lost territory; the third is China's ultimate victory. In the first two possible outcomes, foreign commerce in China has no future. Only if China wins the war of resistance will foreign investment in China be profitable. From this, it can be seen that China's victory in the war of resistance is not only what the Chinese people are hoping for day and night, but also what foreign capitalists are happy to hear. Foreign capitalists clearly see that only if China wins the final victory will their investments in China have hope. Therefore, for their own benefit, they will inevitably help our country as much as possible.

Although the current Sino-Japanese War is far from its end, some people are already discussing future problems, especially regarding the role foreign enterprises will play in future reconstruction. Neither China nor Japan has sufficient capital to engage in construction, so the position of foreign investors seems very important. This is similar to the situation in Europe after being devastated by the last World War. If we review the past and analyze current trends, we can roughly predict the potential future of foreign investors.

Let's first assume that Japan will win in the future—an assumption the author believes will not come true. However, some people believe that although Japan will inevitably lose all its vitality, victory will still belong to her. If this is the case, what investment or trade opportunities will countries other than Japan have? Japan's economic structure was already unsound before the war, and now it is even more exhausted due to the prolongation of the war. Of course, it can only allocate a very small portion of capital to reconstruction. However, is providing capital to Japan to enable it to exploit the Chinese people beneficial to foreign investors?

The result of the Sino-Japanese War is generally this: closing the door to foreign direct investment. This can be seen from Japan's establishment of new enterprises and expansion of existing enterprises. Most of these exaggerated plans come from Tokyo, with the aim of establishing a monopolistic system in all aspects. This not only serves as an advance warning to non-Japanese investors who want to enter China, but also severely threatens foreign enterprises with a long history in Chinese territories that have fallen into Japanese hands. The right to navigate inland rivers is now only enjoyed by Japanese shipping companies. In addition to forcing existing Chinese enterprises to practice "Sino-Japanese cooperation," the Japanese have also established huge new joint-stock companies in China. The Huazhong Development Company has a capital of 100 million yen and has the right to invest and coordinate the finances of various enterprises "for public welfare and industrial development." These so-called industries include transportation, electricity, gas, water, minerals, aquatic products, and "other industries related to public welfare." A larger but similar organization has been established in North China with a capital of 390 million yen. Obviously, these all-encompassing semi-official organizations only create large-scale monopolies like those in "Manchukuo." Given this situation, can we blame foreign businessmen for feeling that investing in Japanese-occupied areas is unreliable?

Many people feel that the most detrimental sign for foreign commerce in China if Japan wins is the attempt to link Chinese currency with the Japanese yen. There is ample reason for this. If Chinese currency is attached to the Japanese yen group, foreign countries will be forced to abandon a large portion of their existing trade with China. After the currencies of the two countries are linked, economic management and restrictions will inevitably be implemented, and foreign trade will decline. As a certain political commentator pointed out: "Strict restrictions and political rule will result in the misfortune of foreign commerce in China." Imports from countries other than Japan will be suppressed in order to maintain the managed currency, which will give Japanese goods a good opportunity to enter. Furthermore, according to the already announced procedures for demanding reparations from China after the war, it is enough to foresee that China's import and export trade will be strictly managed and occupied by Japan.

Indirect investment may have better prospects, that is, providing capital to these huge Japanese monopoly enterprises. The Japanese have worked hard to attract foreign capital to develop "Manchukuo," and they will use this attempt to develop Central and Western China in the future. Naturally, many Japanese feel that if they want to complete their plans, it is necessary to attract foreign investment. A leader of a large-scale enterprise in China once admitted: "The economic development of Shanghai and South China requires huge investment. Japan itself does not have such great strength, so it hopes to obtain low-interest capital from Britain, the United States, and France." There are countless similar statements, and they are undoubtedly sincere. Needless to say, not all Japanese people hold this view. The business leader just mentioned also admitted this, saying: "Some Japanese people oppose the use of foreign capital because investors tend to take excessive actions." He also said that when the extent of these excessive actions by foreign investors is too great, "we will try to improve the situation." This kind of restriction by the Japanese on foreign investment only makes investors hesitate and consider before investing. When Japan's monopoly destroys foreign commerce, even the "die-hards" in Shanghai will think: "It is impossible for foreign capitalists to watch their interests being destroyed and at the same time help the Japanese to exploit their interests with funds."

We have found that many influential Japanese people firmly advocate that the right to invest in China should belong entirely to them. These Japanese people, like those who advocate "Asia for Asians" (the idealistic saying is "China for the Japanese"), want Japan to monopolize the benefits of victory. Their excuse is that if there are benefits, they were obtained by the Japanese military spending huge amounts of Japanese lives and Japanese money on military operations. The Japanese people are sacrificing their lives and bearing extra taxes because of the war, and propagating this gospel to them is obvious. Nationalism is not a specialty of Japan, but nationalism will have a strong impact on foreign investment in China, whether direct or indirect.

The Japanese also have a long-standing belief that the Chinese are incapable of self-government. Therefore, promoting a Chinese government will lead to foreign oppression, and the force influencing China should and must be Japan. Even the authoritative Japanese industrial publication "Oriental Economist" has said: "If China's economy is to develop smoothly, Japan needs to be dominant in China." Even the less nationalistic publications in Japan adopt this attitude, which is naturally not a good omen for non-Japanese investment, especially when observing the position of foreign investors in areas directly or indirectly governed by the Japanese government, it is even less optimistic.

As China continued to lose larger cities, especially after losing Guangzhou and Hankou, Japan's attitude of wanting to monopolize China became more aggressive than before. Japan has regarded China as a Japanese vassal, like Manchukuo. Konoe's statement last November declared that Japan's purpose was to "establish a new order that guarantees permanent stability in East Asia," "establish political, economic, cultural, and other mutual assistance and equality between Japan, 'Manchukuo,' and China." One of the main goals is to realize the "economic close connection" of all of East Asia. Regardless of whether this goal is right or wrong, it will not have the results they want if it does not destroy existing foreign enterprises or damage their potential future markets in the Far East. The new chairman of the Huazhong Development Company, when the company was formally established, declared that Japan had no intention of monopolizing China, nor would it interfere with existing foreign enterprises. At the same time, he denied the urgent need for foreign capital. Although he made statements that would not exclude foreign interests, the implementation of the actual plan is tantamount to closing the market for existing or planned foreign enterprises.

In short, the merger of all-encompassing monopolistic enterprises, strict currency management and unavoidable commercial restrictions, restrictions on allowing foreigners to participate in indirect investment, and the threat of establishing superiority in newly occupied areas all make people feel that foreign enterprises are unsafe in China under Japanese rule.

Above, the author expressed a personal opinion that Japan will not win the current war. What is the reason for this? The most obvious reason is the slow progress of the Japanese army and the neglect of organizing the occupied areas. From this, it can be seen that it is very questionable whether the Japanese army can achieve complete victory. The geographical difficulties of the three provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan can determine that Japan will not achieve complete victory. Furthermore, conflicts on the Soviet-Japanese border may occur at any time. This spark on the border between Manchuria and Siberia could become a prairie fire. If this becomes a reality, then the main force of the Japanese army will probably be used to deal with a more powerful northern enemy.

If Japan does not win, what will happen? One possibility is that the situation will remain temporarily unchanged, with Japan occupying certain areas while China retains its inland provinces. This is nothing more than an armed truce.

Under these conditions, what are the prospects for foreign investors in Japanese-occupied areas? This will generally not be better than the result of Japan's victory, or even worse. The vast guerrillas in the rear of the Japanese army will never stop their activities because Japan has stopped its offensive. Even now, Japan can only occupy important cities and railways in China, and outside of cities and railways, it is completely dominated by Chinese guerrillas. They often sabotage Japanese military and supply lines. When large Japanese troops invade, the guerrillas are relatively silent. When the main force of the Japanese army passes or the garrison forces are reduced, the guerrilla attacks begin again. They will not stop attacking, allowing the Japanese to calmly consolidate and build up the economy in the occupied areas.

The Chinese guerrillas themselves are not only very active, but also receive government assistance and encouragement to recover the lost territories seized by the Japanese army. Japan is incapable of conquering China, but China will not be incapable of continuing to harass the Japanese army, making Japan's aggression unprofitable. In fact, China will temporarily disrupt all Japanese economic plans from its unconquerable base, just as the guerrillas do. Such a prospect is certainly not conducive to foreign investors, even if investors only want to invest through Japanese-managed organizations, such investment is unprofitable.

China will be greatly weakened by this war, and after the war, it must use its weakened economic strength to shoulder the responsibility of reconstruction. There is considerable reason for this frugality. The Japanese aggression has caused extensive damage to China, and China itself has destroyed it due to military needs. Various bombings and tens of thousands of refugees have migrated and become displaced due to the war. These reasons combined will inevitably cause extremely serious problems for China. A large part of China's productive capacity has been destroyed, and at the same time, consumption power has increased, and this consumption demand must be satisfied from the weakened productive capacity. This situation seems to be enough to prove that the view of a British China expert is correct, who said: "The Chinese countryside is once again falling into ××××, and the chaos we are accustomed to is once again before our eyes." That's right, last spring, the area north of the Yellow River fell into chaos due to the rapid southward advance of the Japanese army. There was a period when there was no government rule. However, what do we find in the north now? According to reliable sources, the chaotic situation there has not only reached a very small extent, but everything under the management of the guerrillas is more advanced than before the war. If such a movement can grow up behind the Japanese army, then in the areas ruled by the Chinese, can't the same organization be established to replace the rule of bandits and warlords?

Mr. Maco, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in Hankou, said in a speech last year: "A government in such difficult and difficult circumstances, in such urgent need of funds to support itself, will eventually resort to extreme means." The author does not agree with this view. Any tendency to autocratic monopoly cannot resist the Chinese people's tendency towards democracy. In this war of resistance, which requires the whole nation to support it wholeheartedly, Chinese farmers have already enjoyed certain rights. Once they are satisfied with these rights, they will naturally fight to insist on these rights without letting go. Therefore, the author believes that political dictatorship will not occur.

If Mr. Maco meant the economic policies prevalent in extremely nationalistic countries, then from the perspective of foreign enterprises, it is worth considering. The difficulty of China's currency management will inevitably force the Chinese government to further restrict foreign exchange; and this restriction is still increasing. In the end, it will force the implementation of barter trade with foreign countries. The government's commercial organizations will also continue to increase at the same time, and trade will be transformed into government or semi-official monopolies. Even before the start of the Chinese War of Resistance, foreign merchants were concerned about the Chinese government's attitude towards trade. The tea trade and tung oil trade are now managed by government agencies. Regarding the former, the Chinese government's original intention was to improve the export trade of tea, and a British tea expert was hired to do the work. However, this Chinese Tea Company has now become a competitor of merchants. The Chinese Vegetable Oil Company has also developed into a competitor of merchants, rather than a purely improving vegetable oil purpose organization. These new government organizations will continue to compete with merchants. As Mr. Maco pointed out in his speech: "Due to the difficulty of balancing barter trade, more and more commodities are controlled by the government. At the same time, high interference will be imposed on private enterprises." In addition to these organizations, there are also several enterprises completely monopolized by the government, and the tung industry and antimony industry are two of them.

If we want to determine the future of foreign enterprises in China, we must know that the Chinese government's ultimate goal is to recover lost territories. Therefore, purely profit-seeking foreign enterprises have few opportunities in a divided China.

The third possibility—China's victory—is the final outcome of the Sino-Japanese War. Because of the second possibility, that is, a part of Chinese territory is ruled by Japan, it is only a temporary armed truce. China will inevitably continue the war of resistance until it completely recovers its lost territories. However, a completely independent China after victory will make people suspicious, fearing that China's extreme nationalist ideas will hinder foreign interests.

China has repeatedly stated that she will devote herself to internal construction and has no aggressive intentions of modern nationalism. However, they may use nationalistic ideas internally. They can build an economy that completely belongs to China and try their best to avoid foreign management, which will conflict with the interests of foreign investors.

Generally speaking, commercial restrictions and controls implemented for military convenience are necessary in countries at war. It is a matter of course to implement various policies for the sake of national survival. China's destruction is so great that it will naturally need all available resources for future reconstruction. China's needs are so great that she will naturally try her best to establish a new modern economy, to produce and maintain a favorable commercial balance, and to increase foreign exchange to purchase materials that China does not have. This will cause official companies to conflict with foreign commercial interests to some extent.

Now let us study the issue of investing in the form of loans. For example, loans to repair or extend or build new railways. These new plans are of course implemented by the government or semi-official companies. However, it is also obvious that China needs foreign funds or credit assistance. The profits of investors will not come from monopolies but from the increase in commerce and production. Legitimate foreign investment can obtain reasonable profits, and this profit is almost certain to be obtained. However, this kind of investment cannot be compared with any previous loans, which could generate extra huge profits at once.

Therefore, regarding the future of foreign enterprises in China, we believe that in any case, it will never be the same as before, when China had internal strife and people boldly dared to plunder. Of course, there are few investment opportunities if investors want to invest in the form of previous loans. Among the three possible outcomes of the Sino-Japanese War discussed above, if two of them become reality, there are few opportunities for large-scale foreign investment to gain a foothold. Whether China will be occupied by a part of Japanese territory and China will first recuperate and then continue the war of resistance, or China will be completely conquered by Japan, neither of these two possible outcomes has opportunities for foreign investment. China's victory in the war of resistance, although everything will be considered for the benefit of the Chinese people, is still the most favorable result for foreign investment.

To put it simply, from the purposes of China and Japan, we can know that under certain circumstances, there will be more opportunities for foreign investment: Japan is determined to keep China in a semi-colonial state and forever dependent on Japan. She wants to use China as her market and source of raw materials. On the contrary, China only wants to regain independence and establish a self-sufficient economy. If there are opportunities for foreign enterprises in China to develop, it will only be after China wins the war of resistance and when China rebuilds its economy.

### The Demise of Japanese Liberals

— Originally by贺赛尔 (He Sai'er) (1) Originally published in "Asia Magazine"

Japanese liberals have now disappeared. In a country ruled by soldiers who are engaged in a war of aggression, there is naturally no room for liberals. Thought itself is contraband, and the minds of general liberals are full of dangerous ideas. This is naturally very suspicious in Japan. A communist who organizes radical farmers, or a troublemaker who incites labor strikes, is certainly quite dangerous, but a liberal is much more dangerous than them. Because his thinking is essentially part of an imported worldview.

Who represents this dangerous stage? There are no definite boundaries or standards. We cannot say that every intellectual is a liberal, and in fact, many intellectuals have already transformed and are singing "sincere cooperation." But the intellectual circle is still the main base of free thought. General professors have become the number one enemy of the country because of their own education and their close contact with the youth.

In Tokyo alone, there are now almost twenty university professors detained there, and the number in other places is unknown. The person in charge of the ideological department of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department once said that most of these criminals are stubborn and cannot be changed. They have tried every means to transform the thinking of those most unwanted young professors, but they have not succeeded. Previously, a young professor of economics was arrested for ideological problems. Every day, a senior official went to the prison to talk to him, and later told him that as long as he published an article in a magazine denying his previous views, he could immediately regain his freedom. But until now, he has not agreed to this method. There is also a professor of political science who was forced to resign for ideological problems. Later, he had to write film criticism to make a living, but he still continued to express his opinions between the lines, so he was eventually arrested. Now in Japan, there are several universities, including Tokyo Imperial University, that must first seek the consent of the police department when hiring faculty and staff. In other words, the current university professors are all appointed by the police department.

Naturally, it is the general students who are most severely suppressed by the police. Before Hitler fully established his authority in Germany, he had already firmly grasped the national student circle, but the situation in Japan is the opposite. Now the young intellectual circle in Japan is being driven by an amazing spirit of freedom. They do not believe in the benefits of fascism, and they generally disapprove of imperialism and the policy of aggression. They secretly hide Marx's books and like to joke with the current rulers. It's even worse if you have a private conversation with them. Several students told me that according to their method, Japan's monarchy will be "cleaned up" in a few decades. People who are familiar with how dignified the Japanese royal family is will be surprised when they hear them say such things.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department certainly knows these things, so arrests often occur near various universities. Many students are arrested by the police in coffee shops without being able to say what crime they committed, so they have to waste their studies. Several places in the Tokyo University district where people play mahjong have even hung up signs saying, "We guarantee that we will not arrest people again in the future."

Japanese students do not live in dormitories, so the above places have become places for them to gather in public and exchange ideas. These fiery young people have various ideas, but most of them are not dangerous. They are not organized, and after leaving school in a few years, they are absorbed by various professional groups. In these professional groups, their spirit will naturally undergo a new round of molding. As for those famous troublemaking leaders, there are also clever ways to deal with them, that is, first lock them up in a police station, release them after a considerable period of time, and then immediately have another police station arrest them. This makes it easy to waste some years, and they don't have to spend a penny.

In addition to various academics, liberal ideas can also be found among businessmen. Not long ago, two important figures in the business world had a private dinner in the private room of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations to discuss the best way to regulate the national economy. One of them could not agree with the current government's various methods, such as wasteful systems, and as a result, he came to a shocking conclusion that "the budgets of the army and navy should be reduced to a reasonable level." His companion also expressed great approval after hearing this. Looking out from the window there, he could see the new building of Mitsui & Co., but construction had been stopped because the military could not approve it. (To be continued)

### Great Victory of Our Army in Northwestern Shanxi Province; Annihilation of Thousands of Invaders at Liminbao; Bai Chongxi Discusses the War Situation

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 15th] Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwestern Headquarters, hosted over eighty people from the cultural sector on the 14th, including Ma Junwu and Li Siguang. During the gathering, Bai Chongxi stated that the nature of the current war against Japan is one of resistance and response. We are in a semi-colonial position, and the key to victory lies in total war, fighting on all fronts – political, economic, and cultural. Although the work of cultural figures is primarily in the rear, their contribution to the war effort is no less significant than that of the brave soldiers at the front. He noted that since the fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the Japanese have not been as aggressive militarily as before. Their intention is to establish puppet regimes in our guerrilla areas and engage in economic aggression. Therefore, in the second phase of the war of resistance, we have decided to adopt a defensive posture militarily and an offensive posture politically. At the Fifth Plenary Session, resolutions were passed to establish the Supreme National Defense Council and the Political Affairs Committee, aiming to make political measures more flexible and to strengthen political institutions in various guerrilla areas. Furthermore, we will use military and political power to implement anti-blockade and anti-suppression policies to thwart Japan's economic aggression. As for areas along the Yangtze River, such as Nanchang and Changsha, it is not impossible for the Japanese to advance further, but the gains or losses of small areas are not significantly related to the future of the war. Regarding the northwest, although the Japanese claim they will attack Lanzhou and seize Xi'an, the success of our comprehensive war tactics in Shanxi means that the Japanese ambitions will be difficult to achieve. This can be predicted. As for the southwest, we do not fear the Japanese coming to attack us; rather, we fear that they will not advance. The terrain and manpower of these two areas alone are more than enough to strike the Japanese. As long as the Chinese people can establish a strong sense of determination, without fear or retreat, regardless of status, everyone should be willing to die for the cause. We will never be conquered by other countries, he concluded.

[Central News Agency, Xingji, 15th] After a certain fresh force of our army arrived in Shuoning, Northwestern Shanxi immediately achieved an unprecedented victory this year. On the evening of the 11th, Japanese troops invaded Liminbao south of Shuo County. Our army, taking advantage of the Japanese's unstable footing, preemptively launched a surprise attack, killing over a thousand enemy soldiers. On the 12th, we successfully recovered the fort, and the remaining Japanese troops fled. At night, our army launched an attack, occupying various suburban areas northwest of the city. The Japanese troops retreated into the city. When the Japanese reinforced, our army voluntarily withdrew, capturing many guns, flags, and food supplies. Further news stated that on the 13th, the Japanese were defeated by our forces in Qiangjiagou and the northwestern mountains of Heilongguan, suffering heavy casualties and fleeing back to Heilongguan.

[Minge News Agency, Xingji, 16th] On the evening of the 11th, Japanese troops from Ningwu invaded Liminbao. According to a pre-arranged plan, our army launched a large-scale night raid that evening. After fierce fighting until the 12th, the Japanese forces collapsed and fled towards Xinzhuang. Our army recovered Liminbao. In this battle, over a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed, and many spoils of war were captured. The Japanese troops in Shenchi are extremely panicked.

[Special Dispatch from our newspaper, Chang'an City, 15th] On the 5th, our army launched a counterattack on Zhongyang, destroying two enemy communication lines and approaching the suburbs, engaging the Japanese in fierce fighting. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 16th] In the past week or so, battles have occurred in Xushui, Gaoyang, Hejian, Raoyang, Xianxian, and other places east of the Pinghan Railway, as well as in Yixian, Mancheng, and other places west of the Pinghan Railway. The Japanese attempt to "mop up" our guerrilla forces in these areas. However, due to the mobility of our army, not only were we not "mopped up," but we also launched counterattacks, inflicting significant blows. In total, it is estimated that over a thousand Japanese soldiers have been killed in various locations, and many spoils of war have been seized. During these guerrilla battles, we have received assistance from the people. The people risked artillery fire to transport food and ammunition. This has become a common phenomenon. Even elderly women in their sixties and seventies bravely provided food, drinks, and comfort items, greatly encouraging the courage of the soldiers.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 16th] In Ding'an Longmen City, Japanese forces recently clashed with our guerrillas, resulting in over four hundred Japanese soldiers killed. The bodies were transported to Fucheng for cremation. It is estimated that over a thousand Japanese invaders have died in Qiong.

[Central News Agency, Changde, 16th] According to the Air Defense Department, yesterday, when two Japanese planes bombed Pingjiang, the Pusu Hospital, which was run by the British, was completely destroyed. Doctor Li Jieban was killed in the bombing. The Peiyuan School outside the hospital was also completely destroyed, and about forty students were killed. Over a thousand houses were damaged. The entire city has been turned into a scorched earth.

[Central News Agency, Weisha, 16th] Nine Japanese planes, in two groups, reconnoitered over Shanggao, Pingxiang, Wanzai, and other counties in Jiangxi Province on the afternoon of the 16th. Six of them wreaked havoc in the Xinyu area.

### Weekly War Situation

—March 8th to 14th—

Published by the Military Affairs Commission

In the past week, the Japanese forces on various fronts in the north and south have shown signs of exhaustion. Our momentum is increasing, and the Japanese strength is diminishing. A summary of the battles is as follows:

Guangdong Province

The Japanese troops in the suburbs of Guangzhou have continued to increase recently, and they are still constructing fortifications to defend to the death. Japanese troops who occupied Dagangling and Mao'erling on the 7th were attacked by a part of our artillery on the 8th, resulting in over three hundred enemy casualties. After capturing those two locations, the remaining Japanese troops retreated to Shengang. Over four hundred Japanese troops came to reinforce them from the countryside. On the 9th, they advanced towards Gangkeng and Zhengguo to probe our strength, while another unit scurried towards Xianggangling, but they were all defeated. In the battles of Xianggang and Taikeng, the Japanese suffered over four hundred casualties. The Japanese now dare not act rashly. On the 11th, our attacking forces, along with the troops of unit ten, jointly attacked the Japanese entrenched near Wei, resulting in a fierce battle lasting until noon. Over two hundred Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Japanese forces, unable to withstand the assault, retreated towards the street. On the same day, a unit of our air force bombed Xin Street and Taipingchang, causing heavy losses to the Japanese. On Hainan Island, our troops launched fierce attacks on Longmen City in Ding'an and Dongxi in Qiongshan on the previous two days, killing a total of five to six hundred Japanese soldiers. They have now directly approached the suburbs of the two county towns, besieging the Japanese. In anger, the Japanese have indiscriminately massacred able-bodied men in the cities, causing widespread suffering among the people. The Japanese troops in various parts of the island are intensifying the construction of fortifications to defend against our attacks, while our troops and civilians are cooperating to kill the Japanese, and their momentum is growing stronger.

Hubei Province

Since the Japanese forces in central Hubei occupied Zhongxiang last week, they have suffered over six thousand casualties and are now at the end of their strength. Our troops in various areas have been actively engaging them. Changshoudian, Yangzizhen, Yonglonghe, and Xiantaozhen have all been successively recovered by our forces, with many spoils of war captured. The arrogance of the Japanese has been greatly diminished. Although we only briefly recovered Yangjiaze, Yanjiazhen, Taipingchang, Lujiayan, Renjiaji, Yanmenkou, and other places, the losses suffered by the Japanese were beyond their expectations. Currently, the Japanese forces in the east are being pressured on the east bank of the Xiang River and are constantly firing artillery westward in an attempt to hold their ground. As for the Japanese troops in the Zhe River area, they once advanced west of Yujiadian this week, but were met with a fierce counterattack by our forces, resulting in over two hundred Japanese casualties. They have now shrunk back and are not making any further movements. In southern Hubei, our army has repeatedly attacked the Japanese troops, inflicting heavy casualties, especially on the Japanese entrenched at Tanyuan Pass on the border of Yangxin and Daye. It is estimated that over six hundred Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Japanese abandoned over one hundred bodies. After the repeated mutinies of the puppet troops in various places in eastern Hubei, the Japanese have been unable to maintain the puppet regime. Currently, all the county towns and towns are under the control of our guerrillas. Including last week, the total war results achieved by our guerrilla units in the past month are estimated to be over two thousand five hundred Japanese soldiers killed and a large number of prisoners captured. The elite Japanese troops are nearing exhaustion and cannot be replenished.

Shanxi Province

Since last week, our troops and the Japanese forces have engaged in fierce battles on various fronts in Shanxi Province. Japanese troops from Yangqu Haicheng in western Shanxi once attacked Gujiao in three routes, but they were all met with fierce counterattacks by our forces and retreated to Zhengjiazhuang. After repeated attacks by our forces, Dawu has been formally recovered recently, and our forces have taken advantage of the victory to advance towards Lishi, launching fierce attacks on Jinluozhen, Jiaokou, Lijiawan, Lianghui, Hejiata, and other places. Our officers and soldiers are in high spirits and have killed over two hundred Japanese soldiers, occupying Jiaokou, Hejiata, Lijiawan, and other places. Japanese troops in Jiexian, Ershililing, Anyi, Cun, Houwangcun, Zhangdianzhen, and other places have been repeatedly attacked by our forces. The Japanese have suffered heavy casualties and are showing signs of collapse. The Japanese troops in Cun have already retreated to Anyi. The Japanese troops entrenched in Jiangxian have suffered heavy casualties and are extremely panicked. They recently destroyed the Yigou Bridge east of the city and constructed fortifications west of the ditch to defend against our attacks. Since our army began surrounding Heilongguan, the Japanese troops have gradually become shaken. Recently, our army launched a brave attack, killing many Japanese soldiers. Heilongguan has been recovered, and the remaining Japanese troops have retreated to Linfen. After occupying Jingrong and Ninghuabao last week, the Japanese troops in northern Shanxi were arrogant. This week, our army launched an active counterattack and achieved significant gains. Jingle and Ninghuabao have been successively recovered. In short, although the Japanese troops in Shanxi Province have repeatedly tried to act recklessly, they have suffered heavy blows. The overall situation is under the control of our large army, and the Japanese attempt to cross the river and attack westward will be extremely difficult to achieve.

Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces

Since last week, our troops and the Japanese forces in northern Jiangsu have engaged in bloody battles in Huaiyin and Baoying. After our army made a strategic shift, we have been actively preparing for a counterattack this week and launched large-scale guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, resulting in significant gains. Xianying County has been formally recovered, and the Japanese troops have fled north. Huaiyin has been surrounded by our forces. Japanese troops from Yangzhou once attacked north of Zhaoguan Dam, attempting to threaten our rear, but our army used skillful tactics to annihilate most of them. Zhaoguan Dam has been captured, and we are now vigorously advancing south, relentlessly pursuing the Japanese. In the Jinan-Quanxiang area of Shandong Province, our troops and the Japanese forces have engaged in fierce battles this week, killing over four hundred Japanese soldiers and capturing many spoils of war. Our army has been particularly active along the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways. The railways have been cut off by our forces from time to time, causing great fear among the Japanese. The people in various counties have formed anti-Japanese self-defense forces and attacked the Japanese everywhere, making it difficult for the Japanese to cope.

Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces

The Japanese troops in northern Zhejiang have been increasing, attempting to clear out our guerrilla forces. Currently, the troops of Japanese officers such as Kumagai, Kikuta, and Koizumi are advancing towards our army in three routes, by land and water, from Huzhou, Jiaxing, Tongxiang, and other places. They have been met with separate counterattacks, resulting in countless Japanese casualties. Koizumi was killed on the spot, shattering the Japanese so-called "mopping-up plan." As for the Pinghu-Haiyan area, the Japanese forces have been entrenched in the city walls, daring not to act rashly. A certain unit of our army, with combat readiness, advanced quickly and launched a surprise attack on Haiyan. The Japanese troops were caught off guard and fled in panic. Haiyan and Shendangyu have been recovered, inflicting a major blow on the Japanese troops in northern Zhejiang. Although Japanese warships frequently appear in the waters of Haimen and Zhenhai in eastern Zhejiang, firing shells indiscriminately, in reality, they are merely putting on a show. Our guerrillas have been attacking the Japanese troops in the rear from time to time, capturing spoils of war.

In addition, there have been many small-scale battles between our troops and the Japanese forces in Jiyuan Mutoudian in northern Henan, Taikang in eastern Henan, Taolin in northern Hunan, south of Hukou Pingfeng in northern Jiangxi, and other places, causing heavy losses and threats to the Japanese, making them afraid to act. They are forcibly conscripting able-bodied men everywhere to replenish their ranks, but as a result, the people are resisting to the death, and they have achieved no results.

### Chen Wanliang, a Traitorous Bandit Leader Collaborating with the Japanese in Western Hunan, Executed; Attempted Escape After Capture; Shot Dead While Being Escorted

[Central News Agency, Yuanling, 16th] The bandit leader Chen Wanliang was a traitor.

### Public Sports Ground in Southern Shanghai; Landmine Explodes Suddenly; Four Japanese Soldiers Killed and Three Wounded During Morning Exercise; Our Plainclothes Team Attacks Puppet Police

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Shanghai news: On the 12th, a platoon of Japanese soldiers was conducting morning exercises at the public sports ground in the southern district of Shanghai when a landmine suddenly exploded, killing four Japanese soldiers and wounding three. That evening, a plainclothes team of over ten people, carrying weapons, surrounded and attacked the patrolling Japanese military police and puppet police. The Japanese military police and puppet police fled in disarray. By the time reinforcements arrived, the plainclothes team had disappeared. Although the search continued until dawn, nothing was found.

### Documents on Japanese Use of Poison Gas Obtained Near De'an; Nefarious Deeds Exposed; Efforts Futile

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th] In October of last year, our army seized two types of documents on Japanese use of poison gas near De'an. Both documents were issued by the "Central China Expeditionary Army Headquarters" of the Japanese. One was "Examples and Results of Special Weapon Usage in the Xuzhou Campaign and Anqing Operations," printed in July of Showa 13 (1938), and the other was "Usage and Effective Utilization of Special Smoke Tubes and Special Smoke Shells," printed in August of Showa 13 (1938). The former document explains the examples and results of poison gas usage, while the latter explains the methods of usage. The main points are summarized as follows:

According to the documents, the Japanese used the following three types of poison gas: First, white simple-packaged gas, used to generate smoke to determine wind direction; Second, green simple-packaged gas, acting as a lacrimatory special poison gas; and third, red simple-packaged suffocation-inducing special poison gas. The first type is non-toxic, while the latter two contain toxic substances.

Regarding the duties when the Japanese use poison gas: 1. Reconnaissance and smoke-releasing plan; 2. Agreement of the first-line commander; 3. Speed of issuing orders; 4. Weather observation; 5. Communication and liaison; 6. Alert and concealment; 7. Transport of supplies; 8. Arrangement of supplies; 9. Ignition; 10. Forest utilization; 11. Disposal after ignition (i.e., transport of gas canisters). Also, the Japanese put on gas masks immediately after releasing the gas and launch a general attack. The gas is only effective in the air for 30 minutes, so gas must be continuously released after the smoke canisters are ignited. A charge must be launched immediately after the poison gas is dispersed to achieve effective gas usage.

The documents also list the battle results achieved using gas. The documents state: "On June 2nd, during the attack on Suixian County, when advancing to the south gate, we could not capture it due to our army's strong defense, so we used poison gas, but without results. We attacked again on June 4th, using gas extensively." "During the siege of Guzhen on May 18th and 19th, which failed, we were subjected to a fierce counterattack by our army. Seeing the situation was critical, the Japanese again released poison gas." "In the Battle of Xiangkou on June 2nd, gas was used." Later, in the Battle of Dangsi Bridge, when our army launched a counterattack, the Japanese were unable to resist and again extensively used gas. In addition, gas was used extensively in various battles on the Shanxi battlefield, such as Jiyuan, Jiangxian, and Wenxi. Each time, our army lost its fighting power and suffered failure due to the Japanese use of gas. Therefore, the Japanese used large amounts of gas whenever they could not win an attack or could not resist our counterattack, but the results were often ineffective. As a result, the Japanese are actively encouraging and training their troops in how to use gas.

The documents also stated the points to be noted when using gas: (1) The various smoke tubes used must be kept secret after use; (2) Smoke tubes and poison gas must not be exposed, but rather thrown into riverbeds or buried underground; (3) Poison gas must not be used in areas inhabited by foreigners; (4) Tests must be conducted indoors, and poisonous smoke must not be allowed to escape; and stated that because improper usage had previously harmed their own soldiers, improvements must be made to prevent problems.

The Japanese troops carry gas masks mainly for protection, but as a cover, they claim they are to guard against our army's use of poison gas. This kind of self-deceiving act is truly pitiful. In short, the Japanese use poison gas to brutally kill our officers and soldiers, but on the other hand, they fear exposing their atrocities and avoiding condemnation from the world, so they try every means to cover up. This shows their efforts are futile.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Hosts Dinner for French Ambassador

### Japan Plans to Monopolize Chinese Aviation Industry; Various Countries Deeply Affected; Shipping in North China Already Monopolized; Inland Waterways All Blockaded

[Shanghai News] Since Japan blockaded the ports along our coast, state-run and private ships have been forced to suspend operations. Japan wants to dominate the aviation industry in China, such as controlling the inland waterway steamships in central China, monopolizing shipping in North China, planning to open routes to Southeast Asia, and refusing to open the Yangtze River and Pearl River. The aviation industries of Britain, the United States, and other countries in China are all affected.

British Aviation Industry Ranked First in China

Britain's aviation power has the largest influence in the aviation industry along the coast and inland waterways of China. For example, in 1936, the number of ships and tonnage entering various ports in China by Britain, Japan, and the United States were: Britain, 48,154 ships, 57,345,515 tons; Japan, 17,911 ships, 24,913,576 tons; United States, 3,973 ships, 3,771,479 tons, which proves that Britain's aviation power in China is more than twice that of Japan. However, after the war began, the situation changed drastically. In 1937, the number of British ships entering and leaving China decreased by 12,831 ships, 21,239,720 tons.

Japan Attempts to Monopolize After the Start of the War

After the war, aviation companies from Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Greece, and Brazil bought Chinese ships and expanded their aviation businesses in China as much as possible, but Japan attempted to monopolize aviation in China, such as refusing to open the Yangtze River and Pearl River, hindering foreign ships from sailing in Funing, northern Jiangsu, and Haimen, eastern Zhejiang, and unreasonably detaining and inspecting British ships. At the same time, Japan used military force to monopolize shipping in North China. In central China, Japan has already replaced Britain's position. The large and small steamships in the inland waterways of central China are controlled and operated exclusively by Japan. In addition to opening routes from Shanghai to Xiamen, it is also planning to open routes between Shanghai and Southeast Asian ports.

British Aviation Industry Suffers a Crushing Defeat

Since the fall of 1938, Japan's aviation industry in China has seen a sudden rise, and the aviation industries of Britain, the United States, and other countries in China have been extremely affected. For example, last year, the number of Japanese ships entering and leaving various ports in China increased to 5,473 ships, 6,484,620 tons, ranking second. In January of this year, Japan had 478 ships, 759,889 tons, while Britain had 304 ships, 840,302 tons. The number of ships for Britain decreased compared to Japan and the tonnage did not differ much, which proves that Britain's aviation industry in China is gradually declining, while Japan's aviation industry in China is gradually advancing, which is clearly affected by Japan's monopoly on aviation in China.

Dalian Nisshin Actively Expanding

In China's aviation industry, shipping in North China is controlled by the Dalian Steamship Company, the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are exclusively sailed by the Nisshin Company, and inland waterways in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are monopolized by the Inland Waterways Steamship Company. In order to expand its aviation business in China, the Nisshin Company has not only illegally confiscated the ships of Chinese merchants but has also built new ships of over 1,000 tons to join the coastal and middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River routes. The Japanese military authorities have given it all kinds of conveniences, and the Japanese government has issued operating subsidies. The Shanghai-Yantai line, the Shanghai-Tongzhou line, and the Shanghai-Yangzhou line are all operated by ships sent by the Nisshin Company. The ships of third countries are all prevented. It is also heard that Japan wants to build a modern port near Hong Kong, in which case Hong Kong's shipping will also be in dire straits.

### Auction of Fishing Grounds Held in Vladivostok; Soviet Government's Stance Strong; Japan Helpless Will Issue a Statement

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 15th] Tokyo news: The Soviet government auctioned off 293 fishing grounds this afternoon, some of which were previously leased to Japan by the Soviet Union in Vladivostok. At today's Soviet auction of fishing grounds, Japanese fishing industry representatives refused to participate. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita will issue a statement after receiving the official report on the Soviet auction of fishing grounds, explaining Japan's attitude. Arita may report the progress of the Soviet-Japanese fishing negotiations to the Cabinet. Currently, the Japanese fishing industry is maintaining a calm attitude but is fully prepared to protect the fishing rights it has obtained under the treaty.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 15th] After the talks between Japanese Ambassador Togo and Litvinov regarding the fishing issue failed again yesterday, they did not continue negotiations today. It is heard that the Soviet authorities have proceeded with the scheduled auction of various fishing grounds in Vladivostok, but this has not yet been confirmed. Political and Japanese figures here are all extremely calm. Soviet political figures have also said that the current environment is very different from last year, and that all border disputes are not of great significance and will not resort to force, such as the Zhanggufeng Incident.

Speech by Soviet Defense Commissioner

[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] Defense Commissioner Voroshilov said that fascist aggressors, recently intoxicated by effortless success, are even more thinking about finding new targets to realize their ambitions of aggression. Although the Soviet Union is the most peace-loving country in the world, it is also constantly threatened by aggressors.

### British Chancellor's Report in the House of Commons: Our Country's Foreign Exchange Fund and Explanation of the Fund Committee's Organizational Law

[Reuters, London, 15th] Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon today presented a bill to the House of Commons to balance the Chinese currency system fund. The fund totals £10 million, intended to prevent unnecessary fluctuations in the exchange rate between British and Chinese currencies. HSBC will advance £3 million, Chartered Bank (formerly Mercantile Bank of India, London and China) £2 million, and the remaining £5 million will be the responsibility of the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China. The authority to manage the fund's affairs will be vested in a 15-member committee. Two members will be jointly appointed by the Bank of China, and HSBC and Chartered Bank will each appoint one member. The remaining member must be a British expert and will be appointed by the Chinese government with the consent of the British Treasury and the endorsement of British banks. The committee's task is to determine daily policies to prevent unnecessary fluctuations in the exchange rate between British currency and Chinese currency. HSBC and Chartered Bank will receive interest every August, calculated at a rate of 2.75%. If the profit from investments in the London fund account is insufficient to cover the interest, the two Chinese banks will be responsible for clearing the debt, guaranteed by the British Treasury. If the fund is exhausted, the Treasury guarantees the British banks repayment of £5 million. In the event of liquidation in the future, any excess of pounds sterling received by the British banks beyond the original amount advanced, excluding interest, will be returned to the British Treasury. This provision is valid for one year and can be extended for six months upon expiry. British banks can terminate participation by giving seven days' notice, subject to the consent of the Treasury or the Chinese banks.

### Jing-Sha Youth Battlefield Service Corps (Part 1)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya

That Shashi has been able to grow stronger amidst adversity, while possessing objective conditions – that is, the enemy lacks the strength to invade – is due to the appropriate military and administrative measures taken subjectively, especially the newly formed and extremely effective mass service organization, namely the Jing-Sha Border Anti-Japanese Support Association Youth Battlefield Service Corps, which, with its extremely pure patriotic zeal, has diligently achieved many satisfactory results internally, almost occupying a major decisive factor.

Now that various popular movement efforts are being launched, it seems necessary to provide a clear account of the organization, life content, and work achievements of each department of the Corps for others to learn from.

The Corps was established just a few days after the retreat from Wuhan. The people of Shashi were panic-stricken, and the atmosphere was tense. Relying solely on military and police forces to maintain order was no longer feasible. The Anti-Japanese Support Association then planned to organize a Youth Battlefield Service Corps (Shashi had been designated as a war zone), and began recruiting. Many refugee youths enthusiastically signed up, and approximately XX male and female students above the high school level were selected (women accounted for about one-third or more). To meet the needs of the surrounding environment, the plan was to seek training through work. Once reorganized into teams, they immediately began practical service work.

Corps members' compensation: A monthly allowance of ten yuan in national currency covers everything. In addition, the Corps leader, deputy leader, instructor, secretary, general affairs officer, and messenger, one each, and three team leaders, totaling nine people, receive the same treatment as the Corps members and are completely unpaid. However, the meals for these nine officers and soldiers are personally subsidized by the Corps leader. There are also seventeen staff members, whose compensation is also the same as the Corps members. All of the above personnel must regularly work within the camp. They all eat, dress, live, and live together, fully embodying the spirit of equality.

The establishment of the Corps differs from ordinary mass organizations. Ordinary mass organizations must first have some regulations as a standard for organizational work. Due to time constraints, the Corps truly recruited at any time and started working at any time, seeking training in the work and correcting errors in practice. Work methods also varied at any time and any place. In the early days of its establishment, the central task was to stabilize public sentiment. However, during air raids, immediately after the all-clear signal, they would publicize air defense knowledge to the people and methods for eliminating traitors. In short, for every new problem that arose, they would only explain the coping methods to the people and not talk about empty principles.

Key points of the Corps leader's usual instructions to Corps members: First, in terms of spirit, take the nation first and the people first as prerequisites, and take military affairs first and victory first as the goals; unite sincerely under one government and one leader, expel the Japanese pirates, and revive the Chinese nation. Second, in terms of life, ideologize thoughts and politics; militarize actions; scientize work; and artisticize achievements. Promote bottom-up momentum, cultivate the spirit of self-determination, autonomy, and fighting on one's own; lead from top to bottom to prevent thoughts and actions from violating government laws and regulations. In short, revolutionize life.

Organization: The entire headquarters is located in a secluded location. Corps members are divided into three teams according to lifestyle management methods. The first team is for older males, the second team is for younger males, and the third team is for females of all ages. Each team leader is hired from military instructors, and there is also a team assistant who is elected from among the Corps members.

The Corps' work methods are divided into nine groups: 1. Drama, 2. Wall Newspaper, 3. Comics, 4. Lectures, 5. Singing, 6. Comfort, 7. First Aid, 8. Eliminating Traitors, 9. Civilian Connections. Each group has a group leader, who is elected by the Corps members, and there is also an honorary instructor to guide each group's specialized work. Each Corps member can work in several groups concurrently, but must choose one group as their primary work.

Examples of the Corps' work performance include the wall newspaper organization: 1. Self-provided radio; 2. Special telegrams and telephone provided by the Garrison Headquarters – therefore, news is well-informed, earning social praise.

The lecture group has mobilized the entire city's population to carry out traitor elimination work and has uncovered several traitor cases. They have implemented the New Life Movement, promoted cleanliness campaigns, swept away dust, manure, and weeds throughout the city, and cleaned up advertisements posted on various streets and lanes, giving the city a completely new look. They do not use many slogans, only using three or one or two at a time. The meaning strives to be simple, clear, and relevant to the times, and stimulating. The slogans are like this, and the writings are also like this. When rumors were rife, two banks prepared to relocate elsewhere, but the Corps sent people to dissuade them, and they immediately dispelled the idea.

The comfort group, in addition to raising nourishing foods to comfort wounded soldiers, also used vests, cloth shoes, towels, etc. to comfort soldiers doing national defense work.

The first aid group's targets, in addition to rescuing wounded soldiers and refugee children, also provide relief to refugees. A total of more than 2,300 refugees have been registered and evacuated. The strong men are sent to Jiangling (Jingzhou) County to be organized into transport teams, young children are sent to orphanages, the elderly are sent to nursing homes, and those with special skills are sent to the Hubei Association in Chongqing to find work, to increase the vitality of the rear.

### Hitler Arrives in Czech Capital and Issues Annexation Declaration, Dividing Bohemia and Moravia into German Territory, Slovakia Also Becomes a Protectorate

(Reuters, Czech Capital, 16th) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop today delivered a radio address on behalf of Hitler, declaring that Germans in the new protectorate would be naturalized, and that the Nuremberg anti-Jewish laws would be extended to Moravia and Bohemia. The Czech customs system would be linked to Germany.

(Reuters, Czech Capital, 16th) German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop today broadcast Hitler's declaration, dated March 16, stipulating the organization of Bohemia and Moravia, stating that "Bohemia and Moravia, as part of the German people's living space, have existed for thousands of years. Force and folly caused these two regions to break away from their historical environment and be incorporated into the artificially formed Czech, which has caused a major and continuous unrest. The danger of this unrest increases year by year and may at any time cause a threat to European peace. It has now been proven that Czechoslovakia cannot survive and has collapsed." The declaration also stated that the land formerly belonging to Czech and now occupied by German troops in 1939, is part of Greater Germany and is under German protection, named the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The German residents of the region are German citizens and are under German judicial protection. The protectorate will have autonomous administration and exercise sovereignty within the limits of the protectorate. The German head of state will appoint a German protector to safeguard German interests and abolish any steps that are unfavorable to Germany. Foreign affairs will also be handled by Germany. The protectorate may have a representative in the German government in Berlin. The German government will provide military protection and supervise transportation and telegraph services. If necessary, the German government can seize any administration of the protectorate and establish German power.

(Associated Press, Czech, 16th) Official announcement that Moravia and Bohemia are formally incorporated into the German Empire, renamed Ozekia, and the swastika flag is designated as its flag. German troops occupied this area, including the famous Skoda armaments factory.

(Reuters, Berlin, 16th) An official gazette has been published here, stating that Hitler has formally placed Slovakia under his protection.

(Reuters, Berlin, 16th) German troops are currently entering Slovakia. It is reported that Slovakia will adopt the same political system as Moravia and Bohemia.

[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] After consulting with Hitler, Holtz declared that in order to achieve lasting peace, the fate of the entire Czech nation has been entrusted to Hitler, who has accepted this and has annexed the Czech nation to Germany and will guarantee the Czechs an opportunity for autonomy and development in accordance with their national character.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 15th] Hitler, accompanied by his entourage and guards, crossed the Czech border by car at 4:00 PM today and arrived in Prague at 7:15 PM, staying at Hradčany Palace (i.e., the Czech Presidential Palace). German soldiers immediately raised the German flag at the palace at 8:00 PM.

[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] Hitler traveled to Prague this afternoon via Bohmisch-Leipa (in Bohemia), accompanied by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, General Keitel, General Stumpfnagel, and Secret Police Chief Himmler, as well as many senior generals and party officials. Former Sudeten Party leader Henlein has been appointed Czech Civil Administrator, while Berkel has been appointed Moravian Civil Administrator. According to reports from the Slovak capital, the Little Russian Assault Troops have disarmed most Czech troops. The German troops entering Slovakia have been confirmed. The troops entering Moravia and Bohemia encountered heavy snow, and visibility was limited to ten yards, making it extremely difficult for mechanized units to advance.

[Central News Agency, Prague, 15th] German mechanized units entered the city this morning, and an hour later, German infantry also arrived. All government buildings, such as the Ministry of Defense, were immediately occupied. Germans shouted "Heil Hitler," while Czechs sang the Czech national anthem. Moravia and Bohemia are now effectively in the hands of German troops, but the number of German troops is small. Czech police and German troops are very polite to each other.

Gajda Appointed Leader of Czech People

[Reuters, Prague, 16th] Czech Fascist leader Gajda has been appointed leader of the Czech people and issued a declaration today, organizing a labor committee consisting of representatives from all classes. The secret police have begun to perform their duties. Czech residents are staying indoors at night and can only communicate with each other by phone, and even then, they must be careful because the phones are being tapped. Also, the Czech cabinet has resigned.

[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] Hitler has authorized General Blaskowitz to handle matters in Bohemia and Moravia on an interim basis.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 16th] After Germany occupied Czech, its territory has increased by two provinces of extremely wealthy land. Bohemia and Moravia are Czech territory. Although they may still retain a considerable degree of autonomy, they will become German people, and the two provinces will become German provinces. As a result, Germany's population has increased by seven million people, and it can also easily obtain the agricultural products of the two provinces. After this, Germany will carry out five things in the occupied territories: (1) Unify the currency and customs duties of Bohemia and Moravia, (2) Extend Goering's Four-Year Plan to the two new provinces, (3) Take over all gold reserves of the Czech National Bank, (4) After disbanding the rebellious troops, the defense of Bohemia and Moravia will be the responsibility of the German army, (5) Implement anti-Jewish regulations.

[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] German Freick is flying to Prague today to "clarify international legal issues regarding Bohemia and Moravia."

[Reuters, Berlin, 15th] Germany's first official comment on today's events appeared in the Foreign Office's News Agency, stating that "History has never given Czech any independent demands. Czech government leaders have now come to the conclusion that the Czechs' experiment of governing Bohemia and Moravia alone has failed."

German Troops Continue to Advance Towards Slovakia

[Reuters, Czech Capital, 16th] It is reported that several German troops, in conjunction with the Linke Guard, have invaded Slovakia to "protect the Slovak people." Residents remain silent and cope with the ongoing events. Military operations in the streets have ceased. The situation throughout the city has now returned to normal. All military equipment and radio transmitters, except those used by the official city, are owned by the military authorities. The authorities are monopolizing food to obtain undue profits. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is currently in Prague and had a long talk with Italian Ambassador Fransani this morning.

[Haitong News Agency, Vienna, 16th] It is claimed that German troops entered Bratislava yesterday afternoon and are now continuing to advance into Slovakia.

[Haitong News Agency, Bratislava, 16th] After being appointed Minister of the Interior of the new cabinet, Sidor has left here for a four-week vacation. The duties of the Minister of the Interior are temporarily taken over by Prime Minister Tiso. After Sidor leaves, he may not return.

### Ruthenia Declares Independence, Appoints Volosin as President, Resists Aggression and Inflicts Heavy Losses on Hungarian Troops

(Associated Press, Bratislava, 15th) The Ruthenian Parliament has formally declared Ruthenia completely independent and decided to resist the Hungarian invasion.

(Haitong News Agency, Hust, 16th) After the Ruthenian Parliament declared independence, it has reorganized the new government and appointed Volosin as President. The new government has contacted various foreign countries seeking recognition.

(Haitong News Agency, Prague, 15th) After the establishment of the new Ruthenian cabinet, Prime Minister Volosin telegraphed the Polish authorities for cooperation, but Poland did not respond.

Ruthenia Orders Mobilization

(Haitong News Agency, Bratislava, 16th) Fierce fighting has taken place in the border areas between Ruthenia and Hungary. Hungarian troops invaded and occupied 18 towns in the morning, but they have now been expelled by Ruthenian national defense forces. At the same time, the railway between the Ruthenian capital and the Hungarian capital has also been destroyed, preventing the Hungarian army from transporting troops. The war extended into the afternoon, and the national army was unable to withstand it and gradually retreated out of the territory. The attack by the Hungarian army on the village of Silisi was also repelled with heavy losses. It is reported that the young people of Ruthenia are rushing to the front lines to defend the country. Slovak soldiers residing in Ruthenia have also joined the army to serve. President Volosin has ordered a general mobilization, and all men in the country will be enlisted.

[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] The Ruthenian National Defense Force is now doing its best to resist the Hungarian invasion. Volunteers and civilians in various places are grabbing various objects as weapons to fight for the independence of the country. Because the Czech army does not allow the supply of military supplies and is obstructing it, there are many difficulties in the war. It is claimed that the Hungarian army has occupied four towns and is now attacking the fifth town.

[Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 16th] The Hungarian army was originally scheduled to arrive at the Polish border yesterday, but due to the fierce resistance of the Ruthenian army along the way, it failed to arrive as scheduled, but it is believed that it can arrive today.

Hungary Does Not Allow Cessation of Aggression

[Haitong News Agency, Prague, 16th] Two platoons of Czech troops in Ruthenia were forced to retreat to Polish territory due to the Hungarian invasion. They were disarmed and taken in by Polish troops.

[Haitong News Agency, Budapest, 15th] Ruthenia's reply to Hungary's ultimatum was delivered here last night. The reply stated that Ruthenia has sent three representatives to Hungary as quickly as possible to request the Hungarian government to immediately order a halt to military operations. Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky replied that if the Ruthenian representatives come to Hungary, the Hungarian government will entertain them with the courtesy of a distinguished guest, but it is impossible to stop military action. At the same time, Csaky asked Volosin to do his best to avoid bloodshed.

Romania Takes Military Measures

(Associated Press, Czech Capital, 16th) Hitler and his troops are now advancing eastward. The Czech Republic no longer exists. Hungarian troops are advancing without encountering resistance from Czech and Ruthenian troops, reaching the Polish border, so a common Polish-Hungarian border has been established. It is rumored that Romania is now reinforcing its border garrison, and Yugoslavia has also decided to take necessary military measures on its northern border facing Hungary.

[Reuters, Prague, 15th] This denies that Romanian troops have invaded the Ruthenian border.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 16th] Hungarian patrols arrived in heavy snow in Warsaw today and were welcomed by Polish sentries, so the common border sought by Poland and Hungary has become a reality. The Hungarian army said that the snow in the Carpathian Mountains was waist-deep, and it was a mistake to arrive at the expected time. More Hungarian troops will arrive at the border today. When the Hungarian patrols appeared in the heavy snow, the waiting Poles gave them a warm cheer.

Polish Troops Enter Slovakia

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 16th] According to German official explanation, this time Czech exercised the right of self-determination to request Germany to place it under protection. As for the Vienna Arbitration (the arbitration by Italy and Germany to delineate the Hungarian-Czech border), it should be abolished due to the recent development of the situation, so if Little Russia is incorporated into Hungary, Germany will no longer express opposition as in the past.

[Central News Agency, Slovak Capital, 15th] Hungarian troops have occupied the gold mines of Little Russia. Hungarians and Slovaks clashed in Slovakia yesterday, with slight casualties. Hungarian guerrillas have invaded Slovakia. Tiso has mobilized members of the Linka Vanguard to resist Hungarian aggression.

[Central News Agency, Slovak Capital, 15th] Polish troops have entered the Bratislava City Hall in northern Slovakia.

### Terrifying Czech, Fearing Nazi Retaliation, Many Jews Commit Suicide

[Associated Press, Czech Capital, 16th] The people of Prague, especially the Jews, are now afraid that the Nazis will take retaliatory measures, and many have committed suicide. Eight thousand German secret police have already arrived here, so the people's fear has deepened. German troops have imposed a curfew after 8:00 PM and set up machine guns at various key points.

### Anglo-French Naval Cooperation, General Staff Continues Negotiations, US Defense Plan Expected to Pass

[Reuters, London, 15th] Naval Secretary Shakespeare replied to questions in the House of Commons today, saying that future Anglo-French alliances in wartime would be based on the completion of naval cooperation. Negotiations between the naval general staffs of the two countries are still ongoing.

[Reuters, London, 15th] Minister for the Coordination of Defence, Chatterfield, gave a powerful explanation of Chamberlain's recent statement at the House of Lords Defence debate today, that the so-called defence policy does not refer to Britain's will and method of counter-attacking when invaded, saying that military developments in recent years have reduced the power of offensive. The country's existing bombers can be called one of the best in the world. At the same time, the government is determined to enrich both combat and counter-attack capabilities. In short, if war breaks out in the future, the people of the country can trust its air force as before.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] The current situation in Czech should prompt all parties to quickly pass the government's defence plan. Although this is not an official comment, it is the first reaction of the United States to the Czech incident.

### Eden's Stirring Speech Suggests Forming a Coalition Government and Making a Great Decision Quickly

[Reuters, London, 16th] After Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech on the Czech situation at the House of Commons meeting last night, Eden followed with a speech, standing up amidst enthusiastic cheers, saying that the nature of Germany's actions is now beyond doubt. To his knowledge, there is no evidence of any mistreatment of the German minority in Czech, and Germany has not followed the provisions of the Munich Agreement that should be notified to the Czech or British and French governments if any serious or urgent events occur. He believes that Germany's excuse is simply absurd, even if the excuse is true, Germany's actions are still not justified. Eden asked whether there were still members who thought that after the Czech incident, we should still be patient and wait for Germany to make threatening demands on other weaker countries, and that the country is now facing a situation of rapid decline in its international status. Eden then issued a warning, saying, "I firmly believe that if the current method is not stopped and allowed to develop, the world will fall into chaos and complete tragedy, and our country will not be spared." Eden suggested forming a coalition government of all parties. He said that the result of the establishment of a coalition government would be to concentrate the strength of the largest democracy in Europe to an unprecedented extent. He believed that nothing could be more important and beneficial than this. Eden continued, "We must examine the military strength and strategic strongholds of Europe, and consult with those who share our views, regardless of their country or who they are. At this point, we must decide our policy and where we are determined to act. Then, we must quickly decide on a military plan to promote the completion of our policy." Finally, Eden especially pointed out in conclusion, "A great country should sometimes make great decisions. I believe now is the time. I truly believe that only by making this decision can our people be freed from the constant threats and terrors of the present era."

### British Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary Condemn Germany for Endangering Peace: Destroying Agreements and Forcibly Occupying Czech Territory, Which is Bound to Cause a Chaotic Situation

[Reuters, London, 15th] Prime Minister Chamberlain, when attending the House of Commons tonight, made a statement on the Czech incident, stating briefly that the British government's recent efforts to solicit joint guarantees from the countries of the Munich Conference for the new Czech territory have already failed. The British government has no separate guarantee responsibility. After briefly explaining the Czech loan and the postponement of Hudson and Stanley's visit to Germany, (the Foreign Secretary once mentioned this in the House of Lords), he declared that he deeply believed that the Munich Conference was appropriate and believed that the world also felt this way. Regarding Germany's current actions, he absolutely did not believe that the other countries of the Munich Conference were involved. The Munich Agreement was established as a solution to the dispute. Subsequent changes to the original agreement's actions and methods are absolutely inconsistent with the Munich Agreement. Germany's occupation of territories unrelated to its nation by force is the first time. This incident will inevitably cause a chaotic international situation, and its result will be a severe blow to the belief in peace. It is most regrettable that the world's belief in peace is gradually recovering, and tangible steps are expected to lead to practical benefits, but such a bad incident has occurred. The Prime Minister then reiterated his recent speech, saying that to this day, other countries should also contribute to the progress of peace together with the countries concerned. Chamberlain said sadly, "Therefore, I cannot help but feel sorry for this incident, but we must not let this shake our progress. We must know that the wishes of all mankind are still focused on restoring peace, understanding, and harmony. Therefore, our country's goal today is the same as before, to resolve disputes by negotiation instead of force, to realize the desire for peace, although we must be prepared to encounter difficulties and disappointments at any time, but the goal I hold is of great importance to human happiness."

[Central News Agency, London, 15th] The Foreign Secretary declared to the House of Commons that although the Czech government has agreed to the incident that occurred in the Czech Republic, I have to admit that it violates the spirit of the Munich Agreement.

### Labor Party Member Glenfield's Speech: Can Munich's Promise Still Be Called Faithful?

[Reuters, London, 15th] Labor Party Member Glenfield declared in the House of Commons today, "Today is a time when Britain should feel ashamed. We have disregarded the truth and allowed violence to replace public reason and justice. Mr. Chamberlain believes that the promises of Munich are faithful, and the head has already said so. Czechoslovakia has now been occupied, and there is no difference from being occupied without the Munich Agreement. We are not only not entering an era of peace and security in Europe, but are moving towards a period of serious danger. Those who will immediately suffer military disadvantages tomorrow may be Poland, Hungary can be overthrown in a matter of hours, and Romania will also be invaded." Liberal Party leader Sinclair said that what was previously announced was not the independence of Slovakia, but the subordination of Slovakia to Germany.

### It is rumored that Memel wants to join Germany. The future fate of Danzig is also rumored.

[Paris, 16th] According to foreign news, the Berlin branch of Havas reported that it is rumored in Berlin that the German residents of the Memel region and the Free City of Danzig in Lithuania, encouraged by the situation in the Czech Republic, will soon request Hitler to incorporate the two places into German territory.

[Haitong News Agency, Memel, 15th] According to general observations here, the 150,000 residents of the Memel Autonomous Region will soon declare their desire to be incorporated into Germany. Dr. Neumann, the leader of the German people here, declared that forcing Memel to separate from Germany is a far cry from national self-subordination. He said that he has led 87% of the residents and is about to take the necessary steps to change the national system.

Brief comment

### A Heartbreaking Scene: The Fall of Czechoslovakia

March 15, 1939, after Austria, the Czech Republic declared its own death sentence under the policy of compromise and submission, and officially fell! How did Czechoslovakia fall? What will be the European situation after the fall of Czechoslovakia? This is something that every Chinese compatriot who seeks liberation for the nation and happiness for himself cannot ignore. Let us make a "brief commentary here!

Hitler's Brilliant Entry into Prague

According to the Associated Press report from Prague on the 16th, Hitler, the demon king of the German invaders, arrived in Prague on the 15th in the wind and snow. On the 16th, he led a "celebratory parade." The current situation in the Czech Republic is:

(1) The Slovak region declared "independence", but in reality, it has become a vassal state of Germany, and everything is controlled by the German invaders.

(2) The Ruthenia region was annexed by Hungary. However, the Hungarian and German armies are already in confrontation. Because after Hungary annexed Ruthenia, it bordered Poland, which may form a direct conflict to stop Germany. This naturally reveals the contradictions between Italy and Germany, and the disputes are still evolving.

(3) The two remaining wealthy provinces of the Czech Republic, Bohemia and Moravia, have actually become provinces of Germany, and seven million people have become slaves of the country. Hitler's methods of disposal are: 1. The financial and tariff systems of the two provinces of Bohemia are combined with Germany; 2. Germany takes over all the reserves of the Czech National Bank; 3. Dissolve the Czech army, and Germany operates all national defense affairs; 4. Implement the Nuremberg Jewish Law in both.

Here, we hope that the compatriots who have mistakenly heard the arguments of "anti-communism", "peace", "compromise", and "international mediation" will wipe their eyes and see the tragedy of the Czech Republic's subjugation under the policies of "anti-communism", "peace", "midway compromise", and "international mediation"!

British Noise and Cheers

The fall of Czechoslovakia is clear evidence that the German aggressors have shattered the Munich Agreement and the failure of the Anglo-French compromise policy. Prime Minister Chamberlain of England also had to admit this point in his report to the House of Commons on the evening of the 15th, saying: "I never believed that the countries that signed the Munich Agreement could have foreseen what Germany is doing today." In fact, the recent vigorous anti-XXX movement promoted by the people of Britain and France is evidence of "prediction", but unfortunately, Mr. Zhang is unwilling to see and say it! In addition to "expressing extreme regret," Mr. Zhang still encouraged his people to "not act rashly." We should know the pain of his intention and situation—the noise of opposition party members can be said to be a reflection of public opinion. As Labor Party member Telanfield said, "We are now truly moving towards an era of peace and stability. The crisis is imminent. Today, the Czech Republic can be destroyed, and Poland will be destroyed tomorrow, and then Hungary and Romania. What can the outcome be?" Does Chamberlain not know this? Mr. Zhang finally announced that he had appointed Overseas Trade Minister Hessen to pay a return visit to Warsaw, Moscow, and Helsinki, Finland. The crowd cheered when they heard this. We can assert that the sound of British abuse and cheers is the sound of the entire British and even the world's righteous and peaceful people. If the Chamberlain government does not want to lead to a reversal, it should first know what to choose in this sound of abuse and cheers.

Warning from the Chief of the Soviet Red Army

A dispatch from Moscow on the 15th stated that the Soviet People's Commissar for National Defense, Voroshilov, for the Red Army's military preparation, denounced the rumors about the weakening of morale and disintegration of the Red Army to foreign reporters. Mr. Fu declared loudly: "The fascist army that recently invaded Lake Hassan (referring to the Japanese army's invasion of Zhanggufeng) was also misled by this kind of rumor. At that time, they thought that the opportunity could not be missed and could not wait, so they invited frustration. The result of Lake Hassan has become common knowledge. If the fascists still think it is not enough and want to receive a greater lesson, then the Soviet army has been waiting for a long time, why not try it!" The Associated Press also reported on the 16th that Fu also reported at the Communist Party Congress on the 15th that since 1934, the Soviet military strength has doubled, and all officers and soldiers have received strict training, cultivated internationalist spirit, and have been prepared to complete it, and can give aggressors a painful blow at any time. This is a major warning not only to Hitler, who is marching eastward, but also to Japan, which is clamoring for a challenge. We also want to warn those who are stubborn and willingly promote XXX, under the manifestation of the Soviet Union's strength development and anti-aggression declarations, you should quickly clean up all malicious criticisms and stop making fools of yourselves in front of the broad masses!

### European Outlook: Will Germany Reach Out to Eastern Europe Again? Will Italy Create Disaster in the Mediterranean? Britain Attaches Great Importance to the Czech Incident and is Working Hard to Complete the Expansion of Military Procedures

[Reuters, London, 15th] The Czech incident is the focus of today's British Cabinet meeting. Everyone attaches great importance to this issue and is working hard to complete the military expansion procedures. Although British policy still aims to resolve disputes peacefully, it must be prepared for Germany to take further action outside its borders. Today's developments have greatly surprised all parties, but all believe that under these circumstances, it is difficult for Britain to implement any effective action. Former Foreign Secretary Eden's proposal to form a coalition government of all parties has very few supporters. According to the observations of diplomatic observers, the disintegration of the Czech Republic was faster than expected, but Hitler's swift and rapid occupation of Bohemia and Moravia was not enough to surprise anyone. The method used by Germany this time is no different from the successful method it has used to expand outward once or twice in the past twelve months, that is, it is fully prepared, and once the preparation is completed, the incident will break out, and the German army will only complete the occupation diplomacy and what it has gained above. However, what the German army has gained this time is not flowers and cheers, but jeers. It is said that the two provinces of the Czech Republic are fat meat, and Germany may find it difficult to swallow, but Germany's strong digestion ability has been revealed before. Whether Hungary's forceful seizure of Little Russia had Germany's prior consent is not known. Generally, Germany will not pay much attention to this, because Hungary itself does not have much strength to resist Germany's eastward advance. Poland and Italy expressed satisfaction with Hungary's move, but the Netherlands was very annoyed by the changes in the Slovak situation. Diplomatic observers are now watching the second major change in the world: Germany has something to do with Eastern Europe, or Italy is creating disaster in the Mediterranean. According to general observations, Germany once promised Italy full assistance when it annexed other groups in the past, but on this slim basis, Italy can hardly have excessive hope. At the same time, according to news from France, the French ambassador to Germany has formally inquired about the true meaning of Hitler's declaration and the Czech incident. French Foreign Minister Bonnet spoke with the Polish ambassador and the ambassadors to Britain and France this morning. In the evening, the French Foreign Minister received the German ambassador. At that time, he will convey to the French Foreign Minister that Germany's actions regarding the Czech Republic were all agreed to by the Czech government. The sudden turn of events in the Czech incident has made the impression in the French capital extremely deep, but what makes the French the most uneasy is Hitler's declaration that the Czech Republic is Germany's lifeline and that it has belonged to Germany for thousands of years. This declaration clearly abandons the principle of national appeal in the book "Mein Kampf" and Hitler's declaration after the Munich Conference, saying that the German National Socialist Party does not allow non-Germans to participate in advocacy in Germany.

National Review

British

[Central News Agency, London, 16th] This morning, all newspapers had extremely detailed discussions on the meeting between Hitler and Czech President Hacha. The diplomatic correspondents of the newspapers and the German visitor of The Times all said that during the meeting, Hitler said that if the Czech side did not accept Germany's demands, he would send planes to Prague for bombing immediately.

American

[Reuters, New York, 16th] "The New York Times" said today, "Hitler has shattered the only army that can resist his plans between Berlin and the Danube. He has stretched out the hand of a robber and added it to gold, which is what he urgently wants to hear. He has given a lesson to the small countries of Central Europe and has shown the world the value of Nazi promises and Germany's true purpose."

Soviet

[Reuters, Moscow, 15th] The Truth Newspaper published an article commenting on the Czech incident, saying that "Czechoslovakia's complete submission has made Germany's threat to Poland and Romania even greater, and there is a possibility of new friction and conflict in Central Europe." The newspaper also said that Germany has again shown its inferiority of not keeping promises, and this is the result of the weak diplomacy of Britain and France.

Italian

[Reuters, Rome, 5th] The official kept silent about the recent changes in Europe. The newspapers here roughly published general opinions. The "Telegraph" reported that the Munich Conference was convened in September last year to stop the entire Czech war. Munich may have a great influence on the situation, but its spirit has now been lost.

Japanese

[Reuters, Tokyo, 16th] The newspapers here explained Germany's actions as another step in the eastward advance. The "Asahi Shimbun" said, "Stalin said in his speech at the Communist Party Congress that Germany has changed its plan to advance eastward and turned westward. This is a big mistake. Poland and Romania will be the most threatened in the future."

German

[Reuters, Palind, 16th] Today, all newspapers here believe that abandoning the principle of national self-determination is a legitimate move, saying that in view of the long history, Czechoslovakia can only prosper under Germany's jurisdiction. The "People's Inspection Newspaper" welcomed this matter, saying that "Chamberlain has participated in aimless demonstrations to Germany despite the pressure from the opposition."

### The Famine in Guangdong is Severe: Hong Kong Township Associations are Discussing Relief: The Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce Asks a Central Committee Member to Fly to Chongqing to Appeal for Tax Exemption on Foreign Rice: Township Associations Will Jointly Organize Fundraising to Purchase Rice and Operate Price Controls

Since the smoke of war has spread in Guangdong, traffic has been blocked, and the import of foreign rice has completely stopped. Moreover, unscrupulous merchants are seeking profits, ignoring the livelihood of tens of millions of people in the interior, and massively collecting and exporting grain and rice in an attempt to make huge profits. As a result, rice shortages have formed successively in the four counties of Chaozhou, Shantou, Nanhai, Panyu, Zhongshan, and Shunde, and the situation is becoming increasingly severe. If considerable relief cannot be obtained in a short period of time, tens of millions of people in the above-mentioned counties will be reduced to starving corpses, which is beyond remedy. Therefore, township chambers of commerce in Hong Kong have individually sprung up in recent days and are actively planning relief for their hometowns. On the one hand, they urgently telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Central Government and Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to take practical relief measures as soon as possible and to allow the exemption of import taxes on foreign rice as a temporary measure of relief, so as to quickly purchase a large amount of foreign rice to be transported to the interior and carry out large-scale price controls, so as to curb the spread of the rice famine and save tens of millions of people in various counties in the interior from dire straits. However, yesterday, the Chaozhou and Shantou Chamber of Commerce first obtained a reply from Chairman Chiang, stating that in order to maintain foreign exchange relations, the request for exemption of import taxes on foreign rice was not approved, and it was still advisable to purchase domestic rice from neighboring provinces. Yesterday, the Zhongshan and other chambers of commerce and clan associations in Hong Kong stated that although the Chaozhou and Shantou Chamber of Commerce had received a reply, the exemption of foreign rice from import taxes was not approved, but the rice famine in the interior was becoming increasingly severe, and the people's food was worrying, and relief could not be delayed.

Zhongshan Chamber of Commerce Representative Flies to Chongqing

Therefore, the Zhongshan Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce is still not negligent in its affairs. According to the previous decision, it is rapidly raising huge sums of money to purchase and transport foreign rice back to the interior for price controls, stepping up the promotion, hoping to achieve results. On the other hand, it is still appealing to the central government to ask for urgent action and temporarily exempt a considerable amount of foreign rice from import taxes, so that various effective relief plans can be implemented in the short term. In order to achieve this goal, yesterday, it specially requested a certain central committee member from the county to personally write a poor letter and immediately take a flight to Chongqing to meet with Chairman Chiang and Finance Minister Kong and various Cantonese politicians of the central government, asking them to understand the difficulties of the people and prevent tens of millions of people in Guangdong from falling into desperation, examine the urgent needs of the situation, and allow one million ancestral rice to be imported duty-free in order to save the people of Zhongshan County from hunger.

Preparing to Raise Funds to Transport Rice to Macau

According to what the reporter learned from Guo Quan of the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, after deciding to raise funds to purchase foreign rice and transport it back to the county for price controls, the process of raising funds has developed rapidly. As of yesterday, a considerable number of funds have been raised, and those who have generously contributed are still coming. It is expected that after a few more days, a considerable amount of funds can be obtained, which is not much different from the originally planned amount. Because Chairman Chiang replied to the Chaozhou and Shantou Chamber of Commerce, refusing to exempt foreign rice from import requests, the Chamber of Commerce immediately sent representatives to Beijing to personally visit the authorities and appeal in order to take quick action and relieve the suffering of the people in their hometowns. At present, the only hope is that the representatives will have a satisfactory result in this trip, and that the authorities will allow them to identify foreign rice and return it to the county for price controls duty-free. Once a definite telegram from the representatives is received, they will begin to purchase a large amount of foreign rice in Hong Kong and transport it to Macau, and then transport it back to various towns and markets in Zhongshan County for price controls.

Township Chambers of Commerce Jointly Provide Relief

According to a reliable investigation by our reporter yesterday, people in the Siyi, Panyu, and Shunde overseas Chinese communities stated that the rice famine in the counties was equally serious. If the overseas Chinese communities in Hong Kong take individual actions and launch relief efforts in their own counties, they will feel that they will be greatly hindered in appealing to the central government and all other activities. It is necessary to take joint and consistent action. Therefore, it is proposed that the overseas Chinese communities in Hong Kong and China jointly unite to organize a general relief organization for the rice famine in the interior to be responsible for promoting everything. On the one hand, they will follow the example of the heads of the rice famine county governments and contact the central government for an appeal. The overseas Chinese communities in Hong Kong will jointly send a telegram to the central government, even if they are not allowed to import an unlimited amount of foreign rice duty-free. , please also weigh the pros and cons and allow each county to stipulate a certain amount under the principle of not harming our internal and external financial institutions, such as the previous method of registering foreign rice for duty-free import. If this wish is achieved, the funds jointly raised by the overseas Chinese communities will be used to purchase rice stones, and a fair distribution will be made according to the rice panic situation and import figures in each county, and they will be transported back for price controls. It is believed that such action will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort. Yesterday, the overseas Chinese leaders of Siyi, etc., contacted their respective related overseas Chinese communities, and it is expected that this will become a reality during the day.

Xinhui Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Finance Minister Kong

The rice famine in Siyi is most severe in Taishan and Xinhui. The people of the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong are concerned about their hometowns. Yesterday, they specially convened a meeting to discuss relief measures. Yesterday, they telegraphed the Ministry of Finance asking for exemption from foreign rice tax, and at the same time sent a letter to the magistrate of Xinhui County, asking him to cooperate with various groups to organize price controls. The letter and telegram said: Kong Minister of Finance of the National Government of Chongqing, Xinhui County is now in a period of green and yellow shortage, and the price of grain and rice is soaring. In addition, someone is searching for exports within the territory, which further promotes the lack of people's hunger, which will lead to starvation. I implore you to save the lives of the people immediately, temporarily exempt the import tax on foreign rice, and prohibit the export of rice to avoid the rice famine and maintain the people's food supply. I can't help but feel grateful. President Qu Zesen of the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, Zhang Lanzhou Qian Kou,

Heshan Chamber of Commerce Allocates Funds for Price Controls

The Heshan Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong held a meeting at 8:30 last night to discuss the matter of remitting funds back to the county to organize price controls. Deng Yutang reported that the current price of rice in Shaping Market is 30 yuan per unit, and each yuan of note can only buy about nine catties of rice. If price controls are not implemented quickly and grain and rice are not transported to provide relief, the villagers will have to eat grass roots to satisfy their hunger one day. It was unanimously decided to determine the national currency of 10,000 yuan and hand it over to the county magistrate for management, organizing price controls, and allocating a large amount of funds to purchase tens of thousands of dan of grain stored in Macau by the South China Rice Industry Company, trying to transport it to the county for storage as soon as possible, so as to put forward price controls when the rice famine is more serious. Then discuss the matter of allocating 2,000 yuan for the Shui Kou Township. When Wu Chaoming and the head of the township reported that the township was currently at the forefront of the shops, the disaster was severe. It was decided that the head of the township should first report the situation in the township in detail in writing, so as to forward it to the county government for verification, and then allocate funds from the remittance of 10,000 yuan for assistance.

The official meeting period will begin next week. Mr. Hang's visit here clearly carries important suggestions from the central authorities.

### Alarming Number of Tuberculosis Cases! Over a Thousand Cases in Seven Weeks, Averaging 21 Cases Per Day

Recently, Hong Kong health authorities, in order to clearly understand the exact number of tuberculosis cases, specifically announced that tuberculosis is a disease that should be reported to the government. Only seven weeks have passed since this measure was implemented, and according to information gathered by reporters, in these seven weeks, up to the evening before last, 1,080 cases of tuberculosis have occurred in Hong Kong, averaging 150 cases per week and 21 cases per day. The numbers are indeed alarming. Upon investigation, Hong Kong has a dense population, and many ignorant people spit everywhere, which can be a medium for transmission. Currently, Hong Kong lacks sufficient tuberculosis hospitals. It is hoped that the responsible authorities will pay close attention to this issue.

### Evacuation of Refugees Completed in the New Territories and Sha Tau Kok Area; Huizhou Merchants Association Sends Refugees to Kailong Mountain to Reclaim Wasteland; Refugee Camps in Hong Kong and Kowloon Increase to Over Ten Thousand People

Since the recovery of Dongjiang (East River), Huiyang, Luo, and other places, the refugees stranded in the New Territories have returned to the mainland one after another. The organizations responsible for rescuing refugees are actively finding ways to provide funds and evacuate them. The refugees who fled to the New Territories a month ago were mostly from Huiyang, Dongguan, and Bao'an, scattered in Tai Po, Sha Tau Kok, and other places. Except for the refugees in various parts of the New Territories, who were completely evacuated two months ago, there were still several hundred refugees in the Chinese area of Sha Tau Kok until recently, who have now also been completely repatriated. The refugees there were managed by the Pinggang Huiyang Merchants Association. The refugee evacuation office of the association issued appropriate travel expenses and food allowances based on the refugees' return journey, so as to prevent them from suffering from hunger and cold. As for some refugees who lost their families and had no place to return to, they were completely moved to Kailong Mountain in Huiyang County to reclaim wasteland. This plan was decided before the start of refugee evacuation and has now been implemented and is progressing smoothly. The land in Kailong Mountain is fertile and very suitable for planting and production. Therefore, it is hoped that the refugees who are resettled there will have a good harvest in the future. In addition, there are also refugees who returned to their hometowns via the Bao'an border, stranded in Dapeng, the fifth district of Bao'an, and unable to return to their hometowns. There are still several hundred people. The authorities dispatched personnel yesterday to investigate the actual situation in order to carry out resettlement and relief. According to an official Hong Kong investigation report, on the 11th of this month, the number of people in each refugee camp increased by 300 compared to the figure from last week (4th). Specifically, 1,444 people in the UK camp, 993 in Ma Tau Chung, 1,608 in North Point, 2,840 in Kam Tin, 813 in Fanling (North), 1,021 in Fanling (South), 659 in Gilruth, 1,116 in Man Kam To, 35 in the Chinese, Lai Chi Kok Hospital, and 767 in Ma Tau Chung, totaling 11,296 people.

Since its establishment last year, the Hong Kong Shanghai University Alumni Association has always paid close attention to social undertakings and encouraged its members to participate in various social organizations and devote themselves to social work. For example, in last year's performance of "The West Chamber" by the Chinese Women's Association, most of the actors were Shanghai University alumni. This year, the association's members also participated in the New York Miss event of the Chinese Youth Ambulance Corps, which was highly praised by society. There are also many members of the association who preside over various charitable organizations and social service agencies in Hong Kong. It is reported that the association, in view of the increasing number of compatriots coming to Hong Kong to take refuge, some of whom came to Hong Kong hastily due to sudden changes, resulting in

### Shanghai University Alumni Association Holds Dinner Dance to Raise Funds for Relief; Tomorrow Night at Kowloon Tong Garden Club

### Shenzhen Refugee Camp; Nine Enemy Planes Bombed Shenzhen Again Yesterday; Suddenly Caught Fire Last Night; Most of It Was Destroyed, and the Yousheng Hotel Was Also Affected; More Than a Thousand Refugees Have No Place to Go, and Their Cries Shake the Heavens

The Yousheng Company in Shenzhen, which used to be run by the Free Federation, was built into a refugee camp and all the refugees from various stations in the New Territories were moved there. It was only in the process of making various efforts in construction that on the 21st of last month, enemy planes suddenly flew over the area and dropped bombs, and the refugee camp plan was shattered. Subsequently, the authorities ordered the Free Federation to transfer the refugee relief work that was originally handled to the Sino-Western Emergency Refugee Association to continue its measures. Therefore, the refugees who had temporarily moved to Fanling and other places to avoid relief were all returned to Shenzhen. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 PM last night, the Sheung Shui Police Station suddenly received a telegram from Shenzhen, stating that the refugee camp in Shenzhen had suddenly caught fire. The fire was so bright that it lit up the sky, and in an instant, a large part of the refugee camp was burned down, and there was a danger of affecting the Shenzhen Hotel. Unfortunately, because the area is not under British jurisdiction, although the police station received this news, it was unable to provide assistance. However, there were still more than a thousand people being housed in the refugee camp. With the camp on fire, the refugees had no place to go. For a time, they supported the old and carried the young, fleeing for their lives. Their cries to the disaster site could be heard on the British border, and the situation was extremely tragic. As for the number of deaths and injuries, it is difficult to ascertain the exact number due to the inconvenience of traveling to and from the border. It was also reported that nine enemy planes flew over Shenzhen yesterday morning and constantly dropped bombs. It is not clear where the losses were.

### [Flying Hotel] Flight Delayed by One Voyage; Will Only Set Sail at the End of the Month

The Boeing-style giant aircraft of Fan American Airways, which made its first trial voyage to Hong Kong on the 3rd of this month, flew back to the United States that day. Originally scheduled to depart from San Francisco yesterday (15th) and carry passengers to Hong Kong, it was suddenly announced that the flight would be postponed to the 29th of this month. It is reported that the aircraft was delayed for two days in the middle of the Pacific due to atmospheric influences on its return journey to the United States. Therefore, the trial flight report could not be submitted to Washington, D.C. on time. Therefore, the date of the official inaugural flight must wait for the review and approval of the Civil Aviation Department. In addition, the aircraft set a new record of 10 hours and 16 minutes for the Guam to Wake Island segment. Also, the Philippine Clipper can arrive in Hong Kong from Manila today.

### Six Thieves with Weapons Rob Two Farmhouses in Tai Tau Leng Village, Sheung Shui; The Jian Uncle and Nephew Lost Over Two Hundred Dollars

In Tai Tau Leng Village, Sheung Shui, New Territories, two farmers, Jian Shou (61 years old) and Jian Gui (31 years old), uncle and nephew, live next to each other, only eight houses apart. Yesterday morning at midnight, they were successively robbed by eight bandits with weapons. At that time, Mr. Jian and his wife were fast asleep when they were awakened by the sound of prying the door. They were about to go outside to investigate, but the thieves had already entered the house with weapons, threatened them, and forced them to lie on the ground, covered with a quilt. Mr. Jian's wife came out to help, but was threatened and not allowed to make a sound. Then, they robbed extensively, for about 20 minutes, before joining the two bandits outside the door and going to Jian Shou's house to rob. They left a bandit with weapons to monitor Mr. Jian and his wife. After the five thieves arrived, they threatened Mr. Jian and his family in the same way, plundered them, and left with a whistle. After the thieves left, the Jian uncle and nephew ran out to report to the police. The villagers heard the news and came out to chase the thieves, but they had already lost track of them. They went together to the Sheung Shui Police Station to report the case. The stolen items included 14 ten-dollar Hong Kong banknotes, 12 five-dollar Hong Kong banknotes, loose silver dollars, a headdress inlaid with 90 pearls, a gold butterfly worth $15, a hairpin inlaid with 2 pearls worth $2, five silver bracelets worth $5, a black velvet coat worth $4, a woman's clothing worth $3, a red felt worth $3, and a hairpin worth $2, totaling about $264.

### Story of a Thief

— Falling Sunset

A Serious Social Problem

In the dark and heavy atmosphere, a shouting sound came, awakening the sleeping people around from their beautiful dreams. Everyone rushed out of the door, vying to see what was happening. It turned out that a thief had climbed into the worker's room on the second floor and was stealing things, and had been caught. So, seven or eight burly men surrounded the thief, who was only a teenager and of short stature, and beat him, punching his chest and ribs like raindrops. The thief rolled around and shouted like a slaughtered pig, and the shrill cries stimulated everyone's nerves. Soon, the onlookers could not bear to hear or see this tragic scene and gradually dispersed. The reporter returned to the bedroom, covered himself with the quilt, and still could not forget this tragic scene. After this thief was beaten, he was still tied up. In his sleep-filled eyes, he heard several people interceding for the thief: "Let him go!" Then the thief also cried miserably, saying that he "did such a thing because his family was poor and had no food to eat. Please have mercy on me and let me go!" However, in the end, the thief was sent to the police station at dawn.

What we should pay attention to is not the thief's stealing, but why he wanted to steal things. Naturally, he was not a thief from birth. Before he became a thief, he had experienced many things: - Let's look at the newsboys and shoe-shining boys running around on the road, struggling on the edge of hunger and cold. They also have warm families and kind parents, but because of the poverty of their families, these young children began to struggle on the line of life; because there are too many children with the same fate, competition has become fierce. In fact, many shoe-shining boys and newsboys cannot even maintain their own lives. What a miserable situation they are in!

In order to rectify the city's appearance, the police authorities have severely arrested them, hoping to eliminate these children. However, when they are caught and sent to the juvenile court for trial, fines, imprisonment, whipping, and various other punishments are imposed, it is still difficult to eliminate them; on the contrary, because the prison has good clothes, good food, kicking balls, playing games, playing, and having fun, everything is too beautiful for them. They would not even dream of such a beautiful environment. They are a little unwilling to leave that prison! A shoe-shining boy secretly told the reporter the story of how he deliberately tried to get caught by the police and sent to prison, because his family was really so poor that they had nothing to eat! What a sad story this is!

Obviously, these children cannot be caught. Therefore, the incidents of arresting small thieves have gradually decreased. Instead, their shoe-shining tools are destroyed, which only increases the hatred in their hearts. Moreover, because too many arrests have been made, they no longer think that being arrested is a strange thing. We can easily see that a group of shoe-shining boys are often chased by the police like a dragon dance. This is an equally humorous scene!

Education has become estranged from these wandering children. What they learn day and night is gambling, and what they play day and night is poker. Poor gambling and excessive eating are their daily courses. They grow up in this environment. It is not a blessing for society, but a bane for society; thugs and ruffians, thieves and robbers, are hatched from these wandering and uneducated children. What a serious social problem this is.

In conclusion, can we eliminate these thieves by beating thieves like the above, abusing private punishment, and using terrorist means? No, unless we remove the bad seeds that have not yet germinated, that is, make these wandering children have food to eat and have the opportunity to be educated!

### A Guest from Guangzhou Talks About Our Air Force Bombing Guangzhou; Many Bombs Dropped Near Baiyun Mountain; It is Said That Our Eastward Counteroffensive Startles the Enemy Several Times a Day

Our Planes Attacked Guangzhou in the Morning

The Jinshan steamer returned from the province for the second time yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. According to passengers on the steamer, the steamer sailed from Hong Kong to the province on Tuesday morning of this week and arrived at 5:00 PM, docking at the Taikoo Wharf as before. At about 6:00 AM yesterday (15th), an air raid warning was issued. The enemy military mobilized and guarded the city, preventing pedestrians from passing. In an instant, our planes were seen flying in formation over Guangzhou, dropping many bombs near Baiyun Mountain. The enemy panicked and fought back, firing high-altitude artillery and high-altitude machine guns indiscriminately. The rumbling sound was endless. In an instant, more than a dozen enemy planes were seen taking off from the enemy airport near Baiyun Mountain, but our planes flew very high and the enemy planes could not rush down. They only guarded at low altitude and were still strafed by our planes. The enemy fought for about a quarter of an hour. Our planes were all the latest models and their speed was far superior to the enemy planes. At about 7:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy issued another air raid warning. As for their method of issuing the warning, it was that enemy planes patrolled at low altitude and released the warning.

It is Rumored That We Are Counterattacking Guangzhou

It is widely rumored in Guangzhou that our army is counterattacking Guangzhou. The enemy issued an emergency martial law order and transferred enemy troops to the suburbs to defend. At the same time, the No. 18 and No. 17 enemy warships sailed out of the provincial river and berthed at Humen yesterday morning. It is said that when the Jinshan steamer was exporting, it saw two enemy merchant ships entering the port near the Lianhua Mountain sea area, fully loaded with enemy soldiers. It is said that they were new troops transferred from Taiwan to reinforce Guangzhou.

Chaos is Even Worse Than Before

The chaotic situation in Guangzhou is even worse than before. There are dozens of robberies every day. In this panic, it is truly like a hell on earth. Most of the shops open on the streets are opened by enemy people who forcibly occupy people's houses. When passing through Deye Road, I witnessed enemy Japanese shops being renovated, and the renovation workers were all old, weak, and disabled enemy soldiers. A Mr. Fan took this boat to bring $20 in legal tender back home, but when he delivered it home, his wife refused to accept it, fearing that it would be robbed by the enemy. The uneasy situation in Guangzhou can be imagined.

### Jiangmen, Our Army Advances to Sanshui, the Enemy Attempts to Cross the River and is Attacked; The Enemy Makes Empty Threats and Retreats in the Guise of Advancing; We Wait for the Opportunity in a Relaxed Manner and Strike When the Opportunity Arises

[Quick News from Zhaoqing] Since our troops arrived in the Xijiang area last month and deployed a strict defense, the strong soldiers north and south of the Yangtze River have prevented the enemy from making any progress in the current situation. Over the past week, our troops have advanced to Heshan and Xinhui, posing a threat to the enemy, and commanding guerrilla teams and special operations teams to penetrate deep into the enemy's rear. The Fourth Theater also ordered the taxation regiment to be under the control of Deng Zhiyi. Tens of thousands of soldiers in Xijiang are closely connected. The enemy army has been transferring troops to Hainan, and its forces are already insufficient. Moreover, it is constantly afraid of our troops' attacks. It deliberately steals across the river at Ma Kou and Ma Fang from time to time, and builds pontoon bridges, making a show of attacking. It is nothing more than a plan to retreat in the guise of advancing to cover up its weak forces. However, our army has long recognized this plan, and every time it approaches, it immediately attacks with mortars, causing the enemy to suffer losses and unable to succeed. Therefore, it has been in a defensive state in recent days. Although our side judges that the enemy cannot launch an offensive on this line, during visits to the Xijiang waterway, enemy shallow-draft warships must harass from all sides. By re-deploying along the river, this trip can be guaranteed to be safe.

### Our Army in Daliang Prepares to Counterattack; The × Bandit Troops at Daliang Are Raising Funds

[Rongqi Express] After × again occupied Daliang, their troops retreated to Rongqi. At the same time, they sent urgent dispatches to various parties to assist. All local forces belonging to the First Guerrilla Zone, regardless of boundaries, are urged to quickly send troops to assist. On the one hand, they are to defend the Ronggui area, and on the other hand, prepare for a counterattack. × claimed they would advance towards Ronggui again, but whether this is true is uncertain. Recent information about ×'s situation is approximately as follows: Daliang is not necessarily a place of strategic importance in terms of warfare. The reason × has spared no effort to attack it is actually due to funding difficulties. ×'s army in the Shunde area is without adequate provisions. The so-called Guangzhou-dispatched military headquarters is only able to raise 8,000 yuan per day, which is far from the required military expenditure. They are forced to allow × troops in various places to raise funds locally. The × Xiaolin unit in Nanhai, under the instigation of Li Daoxuan, the Nanhai administrative commissioner, believes that Daliang is a wealthy area where much money can be raised. Therefore, they dispatched troops, together with Liang ××, a captain of the Shunde police force, and local thugs, to invade Daliang. Li and Liang, two traitors, want to take the opportunity to make a fortune. The × troops currently stationed in Daliang are divided into four units: (1) the Xiaolin unit, (2) the Songben unit, (3) the Fuchuan unit, and the puppet Shunde police force. The Fuchuan unit is stationed at the Tai Kee store on Haibang Street, the Xiaolin unit is stationed at Baolin Temple, and the Songben unit and the Shunde police force are stationed at the county government and the Xishan area. On the 34th and 35th days, six × speedboats sailed from the Taipinghai waters to Daliang, transporting a large number of bullets. In total, the × army has more than 200 people, with two small cannons and eight heavy machine guns. The puppet Shunde police force has approximately 200 people, all armed with rifles. Judging from the × army's transportation situation, × definitely intends to occupy the area for a long time. As for our side's troops and police force, they are still firmly defending the Rongqi area. Various guerrilla teams going to assist have arrived from Zhongshun and are stationed in Xiaolan, Zhongshan. Yuan, commander of the First Mobile Unit of the First Guerrilla Zone, has, in addition to ordering the 9th Detachment of his unit originally stationed in Rongqi to strengthen its vigilance, also transferred two more detachments to reinforce. On the 3rd, Chief of Staff Jie Renqian was sent to Rongqi to command. On the 14th, Commander Yuan himself went to Rongqi to discuss everything with County Magistrate Su. Gu Dinghua, the administrative commissioner of the First Zone, also sent personnel to Rongqi to jointly plan military affairs, and ordered nearby local forces to set off to designated locations and await orders. At present, a large army is gathering in the Ronggui area. × will not only be unable to invade, but our attack on Daliang is not far off.

### Anti-War Sentiment of Invading × Soldiers Intensifies

[Zhaoqing Express] The × army entrenched in the Xijiang area has a very complex composition. Most of them are Taiwanese and Korean soldiers and Northeast puppet troops. The so-called formal "military academy" soldiers only account for a small number, and many are merchants forced to come to China to die. Lately, our intelligence agents have often mixed into Sanshui and other occupied areas to talk to × soldiers. They expressed sorrow about the endless war and being forced to invade China unreasonably. Taiwanese, Korean soldiers, and Northeast puppet troops are also extremely dissatisfied with the × commanders due to unequal treatment. Therefore, anti-war sentiment within × is extremely high. According to intelligence, Gao Jianmu and others, members of the Anti-War League, have secretly come to Guangdong and are actively working in Sanshui. The anti-war atmosphere in the military has become even stronger. Anti-war leaflets and publications are spreading rapidly. Incidents such as soldiers committing suicide are constantly occurring. Although × commanders have ordered the execution of anyone who opposes the war and dispatched teams to search for Gao Jianmu and others, all efforts have been ineffective. Therefore, anti-war incidents in the × army have become acute and astonishing actions are expected soon. Furthermore, Koshiki and other investigators dispatched by × to South China to investigate anti-war incidents among the × army arrived in Hekou on the 8th of this month. They were accompanied by × Commander Miyatada and inspected Zhennan, Xinshui, Heqing, Jiujiang, and Southwest, before returning to Guangzhou from Hekou on the afternoon of the 10th.

### Gutian on the Second Line of Eastern Fujian

[Fuzhou South China News Agency] The highway from Fuzhou via Gutian to Jianning in northern Fujian has recently been completed and opened to traffic. This is a contribution to the transport construction of Fujian Province. In the past, the only route from Fuzhou to the interior of the province was via the Min River. The Gutian-Oulu route adds another land route.

The reporter took this land route from Fuzhou to northern Fujian for the first time. At six o'clock that morning, the sky was covered with dark clouds and the ground was frozen. The Fuzhou station was still very deserted. After waiting for an hour and a half, the passengers packed the carriages, and then the train rushed through the rain-soaked streets of Fuzhou and drove west out of the city.

The rain was heavy, and to prevent raindrops from attacking the soldiers, the train windows were closed. A layer of water vapor condensed on the glass, and the scenery of the fields outside the window gradually became blurred and eventually invisible. When the train entered the boundary of Minqing County, the heavy rain gradually stopped. Looking out the window, a green expanse of fields and mountains unfolded before me. As the car passed, patches of blooming peach blossoms appeared in the green, like piles of snow - particularly cold and beautiful. The wheat seedlings in this area are lush green, the fruit trees provide shade, and the forests on the mountains are dense, mostly pine and fir. Compared with the counties in northwestern Fujian, the production is much richer. The villages seen along the way are also cleaner than those in northwestern Fujian, indicating that the residents in this area must be relatively affluent.

The car passed through Baisha Town, which belongs to Minqing County. Although the town is small, the scene is not deserted. Passengers got off the bus and bought some small cakes and pastries from vendors in the town to satisfy their hunger. From the residents' leisurely expressions, I can gauge their living conditions. The indirect suffering from the war must not be too severe. The Chinese nation is resilient. Although the War of Resistance has lasted for twenty months, there is still unlimited driving force hidden in the vast countryside, which can be used for endless struggles. Compared with industrial countries like Japan, which are prone to collapse, the inherent conditions for a protracted war are clearly much stronger. However, this is also partly due to the government's calm response, which has practically strengthened the nation's internal strength, leading to the current situation where we can cope with composure.

Traveling in the rain, I felt depressed and fell asleep on the train. I don't know when, the train arrived at Gutian Station. The rain was heavy, and there were no acquaintances in the city. I didn't know where to go for a while, feeling at a loss. Later, with the care of a station worker, I was able to find a way to settle down in a simply equipped inn.

At this time, it was the beginning of the first lunar month. Every household in Gutian City was posting bright red Spring Festival couplets, but the traditional auspicious words had been replaced with slogans of national revolutionary struggle such as "Resist to the End" and "Ultimate Victory." This phenomenon proves that the public's understanding of the War of Resistance has gradually become widespread. I remember last spring, when Fujian Province gathered high school students from the entire province and sent them to various counties to engage in civil training work, the students of Yinghua Middle School who were assigned to Gutian County worked especially hard. At that time, their performance was the best in the province. Now that the spirit of resistance in the public of Gutian is flourishing, those young partners from that time should be given a large part of the credit.

Gutian occupies an important strategic position in Fujian's War of Resistance. It is a necessary route from northern Fujian to central Fujian. Assuming the × army lands in Fuzhou and attacks the inland, they must pass through Gutian if they go north along the highway. Also, if × troops land in Sanduao, they will attack central Fujian via Fu'an or Luoyuan, and Gutian will naturally bear the brunt. If the war in Fuzhou occurs in southern Fujian, Gutian can support it. If it occurs in eastern Fujian, Gutian will undoubtedly be the second line of defense for protecting the inland. At present, Fujian Province has already made arrangements for coastal defense, and the deployment of the second-line forces has also reached a considerable level. Regardless of whether the equipped forces will be put to use in the future, the military authorities' foresight and planning are truly admirable.

The reporter visited the Gutian County Magistrate in the rain. In the dim electric light, we talked for an hour. County Magistrate Huang Chengyuan is from Longxi County in this province and has been in office for more than eight months. When talking about his administrative experience and future plans with the reporter, he was clear and organized, indicating that he has a considerable grasp of his work. Of the dozen or so county magistrates in Fujian that the reporter has met in recent months, all are young and strong, and none are old and stubborn bureaucrats. This shows the new spirit of the Fujian provincial authorities in appointing officials.

The public security in Gutian is relatively stable. Occasionally, scattered bandits appear, but they are mostly thieves who rob people on the road. As long as the Baojia system is strictly organized, it will not become a problem. Rural banditry is largely a byproduct of poverty, but the public economy of Gutian is relatively self-sufficient and cannot be considered poor. According to investigations, Gutian produces more than 700,000 dans of rice per year. With a population of 180,000, and each person consuming 3 dans per year, the county has a surplus of 160,000 dans, which can be transported and sold to Fuzhou and Luoyuan and Ningde Counties in eastern Fujian. In addition, there is timber production, which is transported to Fuzhou via the Min River for export, and the income is also considerable. Although Gutian is an import county with an annual import surplus of about 400,000 yuan, there are 6,000 overseas Chinese from the area who do business in Southeast Asia, and the remittances they send back each year can offset the aforementioned import surplus and more. Therefore, in general, Gutian's public economy is sufficient to be self-sufficient. Since public life is easy to solve, public security can of course be assured, and other facilities can also be easily promoted.

However, although Gutian is close to Fuzhou, transportation was blocked in the past due to the lack of roads, and the social atmosphere is still extremely closed. This can be seen from the fact that foot-binding is still very common among women who are sixteen or seventeen years old. Now that transportation is convenient, and education in the form of intensive indoctrination during extraordinary times is implemented, this barrier of the old society will inevitably be quickly overthrown.

"Prosper the interior and build the rear!" This is the highest national policy, and also the only important administrative guideline for Fujian Province at present. Under this decision, Gutian County will undoubtedly be able to enrich its content in the shortest period of time and exert the strength of the second line. By Zheng Wei

### A Tour of New Tamsui (Continued)

— Fu Ran

(II) Feudal Forces and Stubborn Prejudices

Tamsui has always been a society with multiple heads. Among the leaders of this society, there are outdated soldiers, frustrated politicians, newly emerging national capitalists transformed from landlords, gentry in the large villages, and respected members of certain clans... But the most important thing is the opposition between the so-called youth and the old age faction, which is actually the opposition between the youth and the feudal capitalist class. The struggle during the Great Revolution was fierce.

Although the new figures who have taken the stage this time are faithful executors of the united front, they only have national interests in mind, and only one attempt: to mobilize all men and women, young and old, regardless of class or party affiliation, in all of Tamsui. However, because they are all young, some people see it this way: "The youth faction who oppose the old age faction have taken the stage. They will never compromise with the old age, and will always oppose the old age." In fact, this prejudice is really very serious. This is a painful thing. This prejudice makes it difficult for these newcomers to obtain their active help, and they will even not cooperate, or even obstruct and attack them.

(III) Shortcomings of the Salvation Workers Themselves

Indeed, although the group of salvation workers in Tamsui have been tempered by constant work, the shortcomings among them are still unavoidable.

(A) Liberal Style - This is not only reflected in the sloppiness of personal life, but mainly in the lack of enthusiasm in learning and work, which is a lazy, objectively negligent liberalism.

(B) Failure to Make Full Use of the United Front - They believe that every salvation worker in Tamsui understands what a united front is, and is willing to exert their strength to the end for a united front. However, they only passively avoid taking a confrontational or discriminatory stance against all parties, and avoid evil. However, they did not actively strive to win their sympathy and cooperation.

### Jacques Nay's Talk - Creating a Unique Screen Persona

Four years ago, while James Cagney was working on a film set, a gatekeeper walked over and whispered to him, "There's a kid named Frankie Burke over there who wants to see you. He says he's written you a lot of letters."

A moment later, James Cagney saw Frankie Burke standing in front of him, as if looking in a mirror. He was about ten years younger and four or five inches shorter. Other than that, his face, figure, and expression were exactly the same as Cagney's. Even his voice and wording were not different at all. He was an extremely similar replica. "I'm sorry, may I ask," he couldn't help but laugh, "Haven't we met somewhere before?"

In this meeting four years ago, Frankie told James his hope of becoming James Cagney professionally. First, he had a lot of acting experience, and imitating James was his main job. At that time, James was surprised and amused that the child could imitate himself so vividly. However, he did not say a word of praise for his future hopes.

Then four years passed. For Warner's new film Angels With Dirty Faces starring James Cagney, a child was needed to play James' childhood. Frankie was found again. He played so much like James that it was almost impossible to tell the difference. So many spectators believed it was James himself after makeup during the audition. Later, in The Oklahoma Kid, he further imitated James' recent movements, twisting his shoulders urgently and vigorously waving his hands. However, he felt pain for such imitation. He said to James,

"It's so annoying, I can't find anything else to do, everyone says I look too much like you," twisting his shoulders.

"There is only one way to think about it," James said calmly, trying to stop his own shoulders from moving,

"What way?"

"Don't imitate me anymore."

"Stop learning from you, but this won't work," he moved his shoulders again, "Or maybe I should, but... I've looked like you for so many years, I can't do anything else."

"Look," James said with a quiet smile, "I do my job longer than you do mine. I can always change myself. I think you can definitely change too. I've learned a very important rule, never let the audience see you repeating a similar role, and a similar actor, just like a similar role, can never have good box office power. It can be done occasionally, but it becomes a habit..." He shrugged meaningfully,

"I think we understand what you mean, let me think about it again." Then the director came to call for filming, and the conversation ended.

Frankie only noticed James' appearance, but ignored his personality. We know that James is full of ideals and dares to try. He can create a new character himself. That is why he has today's success. All the successful roles he has played have been created in this way. Frankie can learn Cagney, but he must never become a second Cagney. Cagney's present is made by his past. You can't learn his past, so you can't have the same present and future as him. Of course, Cagney's acting skills also have imitations, but his imitations are taken from his own daily life, this point here and that point there, put together and adopted after many refining operations.

There is an example that not many people know about. That was when James was still a child and lived with his father and brother Bill. The brothers had a trick they often played. Bill grabbed James' neck, clenched his fist, and shook it in his face, saying in a rude tone, "If you're telling the truth, I'll beat your brains out." Then, maintaining this position for a while, the crude air suddenly disappeared, and the brothers embraced each other warmly.

James liked to play this trick since he was a child. After his father died, he still often thought of it. This trick is a symbol of his screen personality in the future. Even after he became an actor, he tried his best to find an opportunity to perform this set in a play. Finally, such an opportunity came. In a film called Taxi, co-starring with Loretta Young, they should always be quarreling. Every time they quarreled, he would grab her neck and say the same words as above. He was so familiar with it that the result was very satisfactory and received great praise. Why, why does a small action have such great success? (This whole action was really 120,000 points successful. People who have seen this film grab other people's necks and learn from him when they walk out of the theater.) It is precisely because it imitates everyday life, and does not imitate the actions in other dramas, so it is fresh and not old. James will never dare to perform it again in other plays after performing it once. "You can't let the audience see you playing repetitive good actions, otherwise it will lose its authenticity."

In Angels With Dirty Faces, James always says a verbal greeting, "Did you hear something? Did you hear it?" This sentence had also been hidden in James' consciousness for fifteen years. He used to know a rude Easterner, and whenever he saw someone, he always said these two sentences as a greeting. It never changed for ten years. James also heard it well, and finally got the opportunity to show it in this film. This is proof that he has studied every character. Similarly, a certain sentence is only suitable for being spoken by a certain character, and a certain expression is only suitable for being used on a certain character. Just as the twisting of the shoulders mentioned above, it also has its origin. A few years ago, he met a friend he had met once, who always twisted his shoulders like this. James asked him,

"Is something biting you?"

"Clothes," he said, "I'm not used to it, it seems a lot smaller than when I used to wear it. You probably don't know... I've been locked up for a long time."

He had just been released from prison. James remembered this and only pulled it out to apply it now. There is also a point that Frankie should know. As mentioned above, James' success today is the result of his past efforts, but this is only part of the reason. The most important thing is his individual character. For example, he is often a brute on the screen, but the James Cagney of Ping Su is completely the opposite, so military people always criticize him for his unreasonable strength and will soon fail.

Here is another thing to prove that he is usually not as unreasonable as he is on the screen, although he was born with such a face.

James' face.

When James first came to work at Warner, a technician named Wallace Wes Moore only exchanged very simple greetings with each other. Later, the two slowly deepened their friendship. During a conversation, Wes Moore said to him, "I think I can say it now," "What?" "Remember the first time we met? You know, I really wanted to punch you at that time," "Why?" "Because of your face, I always thought you were an unreasonable guy. Of course, I know you're not like that now, otherwise I wouldn't tell you,"

What's more, it is enough to prove that he is a modest gentleman, and that is his low soft voice. Whether on the screen or in everyday life, he always speaks in a low voice, so that sometimes, people have to listen carefully. He himself does not like to shout loudly, and at the same time does not want others to do so.

From this, it can be seen that it is very rare for Frankie Burke to imitate him so vividly for a long time. However, he will never be able to achieve the same voice and status as Cagney. What Cagney said to him also told many people who specialize in imitation and hope to become famous, "Develop your own character and build your reputation." At the same time, "I think Frankie has a lot of hope in the future. He has full energy, and full energy and hard work are the most important elements, and he has both." Naturally, the additional condition is not to get the wrong direction. And some of a true "self".

### A Casual Result; South China South Defeats Little Brother; Unexciting Battle Situation; Score is Four to Two

[Report from this newspaper] South China South has won the highest position in the Group A League after five months of competition. It is bound to win the championship.

Yesterday at 5 p.m., the team played against South China Hua at Jashan. This was a war that was carried out as an example, equivalent to practice. The younger brother also had no need to win, and the victory of the older brother was of course not an attempt to deceive. The general audience knew in their hearts that this battle would definitely be less exciting, so most of them stayed away, and the traffic was sparse and very deserted.

In the South China South lineup, random matchmaking was done. This move was not to underestimate the younger brother, but in fact to understand that the younger brother would definitely concede two points, so the lineup was randomly arranged.

Yang Shuiyi, who had been missing for half a month, reappeared yesterday and looked calm.

When competing, it was casual. Although there was no tension to speak of, there were still one or two things worth watching. As a result, the older brother won by four to one. This was an expected thing.

The first half was two to zero, of course the older brother took the lead. Jingxiang and Manrong made the achievements. The second half was two to two. Jingxiang and Douwen scored on the older brother's side. Shuiyi and Jinhong scored on the younger brother's side. (Taisui)

### Open Tennis Tournament: Chen Zhiqiang Loses to Da Xu; One Singles and One Doubles Match Held Today

The Hong Kong Cricket Club's Hong Kong Open Singles and Doubles Grass Court Tennis Tournament has been underway for several days. After eliminating the weaker players and retaining the strong, it is gradually entering a tense stage. The organizers of the club have hired workers to build a shed and rush to construct the seating area, which should be ready by the fourth week of the competition, allowing spectators to watch the matches in a concentrated area without having to run around. According to past practice, those who sit in the stands pay a seat price, but the general public still has the opportunity to watch the matches until the semi-finals and finals. It is expected that this year's arrangements will be the same as in previous years. Further reports will follow.

Yesterday's program was quite interesting. The most exciting match was between Xu Weipei, the current Hong Kong singles champion, and Chen Zhiqiang, the former singles champion of the South China Athletic Association. In the first set, Chen Zhiqiang lost his composure and was unable to cope, especially with his backhand. Xu exploited this weakness, repeatedly hitting to the left, and won the set 6-0 in one go. In the second set, Chen calmed down and his forehand shots became exceptionally sharp, winning two games in a row. Xu did not dare to slow down and fought hard at the net, leveling the score. At this point, Chen resisted fiercely, saving balls with his backhand, but Xu, with his powerful style, found it difficult to gain the upper hand. The score was tied at 5-5. In the seventh game, Chen was exhausted from running around and lacked the strength to counterattack, ultimately losing the game.

The match between Li Anna and Situ Bi was also quite interesting. Situ Bi initially asserted dominance, winning the first set 6-1. However, he lacked stamina in the following sets, losing both and being eliminated. Overall, the skills of the two players were evenly matched. Although Li was usually impatient, he played very carefully and calmly yesterday, and his stamina was also sufficient. Situ Jian was not good at net play but frequently went to the net, ultimately causing his own defeat.

Yesterday's Results

Singles

Na Xi defeated Ao Linzhen, 6-3, 6-3. Xu Weipei defeated Chen Zhiqiang, 6-0, 7-5. Chen Jinman defeated Cai Bingfen, 6-3, 6-4. Xu Runpei defeated Wang Zesen, 6-1, 6-1. Li Anna defeated Situ Bi, 1-6, 6-2, 6-2.

Today's Schedule

Today, there will be one singles and one doubles match. Da Linzhen is a well-known and experienced player who should defeat Yi Yunshi. In the doubles match, Luo Dingxian and Liqi's team should also defeat their opponents. Both matches will be held at 4:30 PM.

### Mini Soccer Match: Kitchee Defeats Han Ying

In the Rong Yip Brand mini soccer match, Kitchee played against the Han Ying team at Soton Stadium yesterday at 5 PM. The competition was fierce after the start of the match. Han Zhi's weak defense allowed Kitchee to score goals by Li Zhaorong, Ye Guoying, and Zhu Jincheng, while Han Ying's Tu Bingtu also scored one goal. At the end of the match, Kitchee won 3-1.

### Tonight's Table Tennis Matches

Tonight, there will be three table tennis matches in the Jianquan Lin Table Tennis Competition, held at the Confucius Society.

### Ye Beihua Returns to Hong Kong; May Return to the Field

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The name Ye Beihua has been rarely seen in the sports section of newspapers in recent years, but many fans have not forgotten him.

Everyone agrees that Ye is the best left winger in the history of Chinese football and a key contributor to the revival of South China.

After returning from the World Games, he continued to play for South China in the 1936-37 football season. However, because he always played with his best effort and was known for his bravery, he suffered serious foot injuries and had to rest. At the same time, he was working in the Guangdong Provincial Government, which kept him busy. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he was still a civil servant and could not often ask for leave to come to Hong Kong to play football. As a result, Ye retired from the football field for almost three years.

Yesterday afternoon, I suddenly met Ye at the Jiashan Hotel and happily reminisced with him. He said, "I just returned to Hong Kong from Shantou this morning."

He told me that last year (lunar calendar) he met old football friends Liang Yutang, Li Huiguan, Li Shengguan, and Li Qiming in Lian County and Shantou. He also played football with them when he had time, but he felt that he was not as good as before because he had been away from the game for a long time. He expressed a sense of nostalgia for the past.

He will be staying in Hong Kong for a considerable period of time this time, and his heroic spirit as an athlete is still evident. It is not yet known whether he will have the opportunity to return to the field and meet the fans again. I believe this is possible. (Donglang)

### Li Anna Applies for Leave; Willing to Join the Eastern Football Team on Their Southern Expedition

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The Eastern Football Team is currently preparing to embark on a southern expedition (Haiphong, Hanoi) after the end of the current football season. To strengthen the team, they are recruiting players from outside. Shanghai players Xu Wenkui and Cao Qiushi have also been invited. It is said that Xu and Cao have replied by telegram, expressing their willingness to join the expedition. It is also said that Li Anna and Sousa (a member of the St. Joseph's team) have received letters of invitation from a person in charge of the Eastern team, asking for their opinions on whether they would be willing to accompany the team. Yesterday, the reporter happened to meet Li Anna at the Hong Kong Cricket Club and asked him if this was true. He frankly admitted that it was true and said that he had applied for leave. If approved, he would be happy to go on a trip.

### Let's Also Talk About Children's Sports (II)

— Zou Falu

In ancient China, it was said, "Things have roots and branches," and "If the root is strong, the branches will flourish." There are countless lessons on strengthening the foundation. Many Chinese people know these lessons by heart and should pay full attention to all fundamental undertakings, so that they can be promoted and achieve their missions. However, there are endless contradictions in reality, which I find very perplexing.

Let's start with mothers. Women who are bound by old etiquette embrace the concepts of the "three obediences and four virtues" and "remaining faithful to one's husband until death," seeking only to be good wives and mothers. They only know how to manage the seven daily necessities of firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea, and serve their husbands, children, and in-laws. They never leave their homes. If you ask them to do gymnastics or play ball, they will say that you are creating monsters and doing something immoral.

Women who are infected with romantic habits embrace what they consider hedonism, living one day at a time. They spend their days playing mahjong and painting at night. Their energy is either consumed in mahjong or in bamboo forests, or even in lying in bed and smoking opium, the most harmful habit, which they treat as a way to seek pleasure.

Women who are driven by the concept of beauty only have ideas like "petite and exquisite," "too weak to wear clothes," "graceful and charming," "moving," "lotus-like face," "willow-like waist," etc. They believe that the more delicate and weak they are, the more fairy-like they are. Therefore, they fear that their bodies are not petite enough, their postures are not graceful enough, and their voices are not gentle enough. Thus, strength and development run counter to them and become their enemies, which they refuse to look at.

The evolution of these three aspects—etiquette, romance, and beauty—has made the women of the Chinese nation, the future masters—the mothers of children—weary and lifeless. How can you expect such dying mothers to give birth to lively and energetic children?

Let's talk about children. A person's growth depends on metabolism, which produces fresh blood through breathing and promotes blood circulation through exercise. Then, the blood circulation transports nutrients to the whole body, nourishment is developed, and waste is excreted. Obstacles in the body are completely removed. Therefore, breathing and exercise are indispensable for a growing person.

Growth is a person's natural phenomenon. All the skills necessary for growth do not need to be learned; they come naturally. This is called nature. Since birth, children's daily work is: eating until they are full, moving, sleeping when they are tired, and eating again when they are hungry. They sing the three movements of eating, moving, and sleeping all day long, without ever showing boredom, because they want to grow. The nature of movement is not only related to growth, but also to a person's future. If this activity is not suppressed by human force but guided into a regular way and promoted, it can serve as the basis for all undertakings.

Children's exercise does not require any materials, fixed times, or limited areas, like adults. Their crying in the cradle is natural deep breathing. The actions of stretching and contracting their fists and legs because of crying are natural exercises. The profuse sweat they produce from crying, stretching, and contracting is the same as the profuse sweat that adults produce from jumping and jumping on the sports field. Their unguided exercise is a manifestation of their nature. We should not only not suppress it, but also guide it accordingly.

Parents often misunderstand the meaning of children's crying and movement because they value their children too much. They think that children's crying and movement must mean that they are feeling uncomfortable, and that too much crying and movement will harm their bodies. They even give them something to eat or play with because they are crying and moving, so that they will not cry or move. They misunderstand that the purpose of children's crying and movement is to eat. Therefore, as soon as they cry, they quickly put milk into their mouths, so that they cannot cry. As soon as they move, they hold them and shake them randomly, so that they cannot move. They do not know that their crying and movement are to meet the needs of physiological growth. Eating is also one of their needs for growth. If they are given food and they no longer cry or move, it is because there is milk in their mouths and they cannot cry, or because they have obtained an alternative to the requirements of growth and do not need to move anymore. However, these do not meet the demands of their nature. As a result, their active nature is eliminated from then on and never has the opportunity to develop. Those wooden-headed friends are all raised this way.

When children can walk and move, their movements never stop. Sitting cannot meet their needs, so they climb on chairs and stools. Walking cannot meet their needs, so they want to run and jump. They fall from chairs and stools, or they fall on their heads from running and jumping, cry a few times, and then continue to climb, run, and jump. It is not that they are not afraid of falling, but because they want to express their nature, they feel that not climbing, not jumping, is more terrible than falling. So even if they fall, they still want to climb, run, and jump. Parents often scold them for not sitting properly and not walking properly. Whenever they climb, run, or jump, they use angry words to prohibit them. If angry words cannot stop them, they use beatings. As a result, their lively and active nature is buried under angry words and beatings.

Speaking of the materials for actually implementing children's physical training, there are very few families that can follow children's nature and let them develop. As mentioned above, it is even rarer to use appropriate physical training materials to train children. Before the full development of family education in our country, we should not be too demanding. However, there are physical education classes and physical education teachers in schools. What kind of children's physical training materials do they use?

Based on my experience of teaching physical education in normal schools for more than ten years and what I have seen from guiding normal school students to practice in primary schools, although I dare not say that this is the case everywhere, it is at least so in most places. The only purpose of the children's physical training materials they use is to save trouble. They can be said to completely ignore whether the materials meet the needs of the children.

The most common application is playing ball. The only tools teachers use in class are a ball, a whistle, and a few red ribbons. Playing ball is not absolutely forbidden in primary schools, and it can be effective if taught legally. However, they start teaching how to play ball as soon as students can change balls, regardless of whether the students' physical strength can handle it. They use official rules for teaching how to play ball, regardless of whether the students can learn it. The responsibility they fulfill for teaching how to play ball is to divide into groups and blow the whistle. They do not care about anything else.

The second most common applications are gymnastics and games. It is rare to be able to use these teaching materials. These teaching materials seem to be equal in degree, but in reality, the difficulty varies greatly. The procedures for the physiological and psychological development of children are different at different times. Whether the selection of teaching materials is appropriate greatly affects their physiological and psychological development. What I have seen in various primary schools is that they use the same kind of material regardless of which grade it is suitable for. It can be said that no one truly chooses suitable materials in the order of children's development, or conducts research on whether a certain material is suitable or not after trying it out.

Free Talk

### Talking Parrots

— Zhang Xiangtian

In the second volume of "Reading Mirror," there's a quote from Xie Shangcai saying:

"Only when one transcends the realm of fame and fortune can one find a place for respite. Today's scholars and officials are truly nothing more than talking parrots."

This criticizes the inferior behavior of most scholars and officials, who only know how to talk but not act, likening them to "talking parrots." The great Song Dynasty philosopher Zhu Xi also saw this point clearly, saying, "Today's scholars only know how to speak of integrity and righteousness, but when it comes to action, they are neither honest nor righteous." This perfectly illustrates the "talking parrot," capable of speech but incapable of action. How different are these "talking parrots" from the general educated class of our time?

Recently, wasn't there a group in Hong Kong loudly advocating "preserving strength through peace"? But in reality, their goal isn't peace, but rather the pursuit of their own selfish interests. They want to see internal strife and mutual slaughter in China. Their so-called "preserving strength" is merely a desire to see China's mutual destruction be even more ruthless than Spain's. At the same time, they are recommending the Chinese nation to a bloodthirsty demon king, making it forever prostrate at the feet of that demon. The response to Konoe's statement is merely the first step in enslaving the Chinese nation.

If you ask them why they've become so insane, there's no grand reason; it's simply their inability to transcend the "realm of fame and fortune." This corresponds exactly to Xie Shangcai's words, and also to Zhu Xi's statement about "dishonesty and unrighteousness."

If you further ask how parrots can talk, it's simply through learning. As long as it benefits the fame and fortune of a person or faction, they are very willing to be someone's echo. At the same time, they will worship that person as their master and parents, and all notions of righteousness and duty will be forgotten. However, there are exceptions to the talking parrot phenomenon. In the third volume of Liu Yuanqing's "Wise and Extraordinary Anecdotes," there's a passage that can be cited as evidence:

"Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty kept hundreds of parrots in his palace. One day, he asked them, 'Do you miss your hometown?' They replied, 'We miss our hometown.' So he sent eunuchs to return them to the mountains. Several years later, envoys passed by Longshan, and the parrots asked, 'Is the retired emperor well?' The envoys replied, 'The retired emperor has passed away.' Upon hearing this, the parrots all cried mournfully without stopping. The envoys composed a poem: 'Deep in the grass, the birds sing desolate songs; travelers here break their hearts. I cannot bear to hear the parrots still perched on the branches, speaking of the late emperor.'"

If this kind of story wasn't fabricated by spineless literati trying to show loyalty and flattery, then it could be considered an exception. Because these parrots not only could talk, but they could also answer questions fluently, just like humans. However, if we expand on this point, there is really no exception, after all these parrots were merely the echo of a loyal master, eating the emperor's food, they would not be concerned with the safety of the late emperor and upon hearing the news of the master's death, they could actually cry mournfully without stopping. At the same time, the literati, being inspired by the story, started writing "heartbreaking" echo poems, resulting in more and more people intentionally or unintentionally becoming mere echoes.

In the third volume of "Wise and Extraordinary Anecdotes," it is also written:

"Emperor Ming of Tang Dynasty taught elephants to dance. During the An Lushan Rebellion, at a grand banquet for the barbarian chieftains, the dancing elephants were brought out... but the elephants all glared and remained motionless." This is another piece of evidence of animals' loyalty to their masters. In the same book and volume, there is also:

"Emperor Zhaozong had a monkey who could follow the court's routine, and was given a robe and the title 'Sun Attendant.' Later, when Zhu Quanzhong usurped the throne, he ordered the monkey to follow the court's routine, but the monkey went straight up to the throne and jumped and fought fiercely..."

This is another anecdote about animal loyalty. If we ask if all these are true, we cannot know for sure. This is likely another trick of spineless literati.

The above examples all seem to be related. Although animals are of a lower order, they are full of desires for fame and fortune and know how to flatter. The stories are crafted very well. If we judge others by our own petty standards, then the baseness of the spineless literati who fabricated these stories of animal loyalty, filial piety, and gratitude is self-evident.

The same book, volume three, also says:

"Cheng Bochun was traveling in the mountains, and a monk told him that when Yan Yuanxian came south, the monkeys filled the mountains. Yuanxian composed a quatrain: 'I heard that monkeys are fond of salt, when the carriage comes, they fill the mountains to greet it. Where would one see the whipped monkey? Only then I realize that even hairy creatures are worldly.'"

In fact, the last line of the quatrain, "Only then I realize that even hairy creatures are worldly," was conceived by people who judge others by their own petty standards!

Are there any parrots who can "transcend the realm of fame and fortune"?

"The third volume of 'Wise and Extraordinary Anecdotes' says: 'Someone in Dongdu raised a parrot and, out of compassion, gave it to a monk. The monk taught it to recite scriptures. Often it would sit motionless on the shelf, and when asked why, it would reply, "My body and mind are unmoving in devotion, seeking the supreme path." When it died, it was cremated and yielded relics.'"

This, like the parrots' mourning for their master, is all fabricated. Talking parrots who can't act are sometimes ridiculously embellished.

Some people still believe that if things are "correct in name" and "reasonable in words," then they can be done. But after seeing the parrots' mimicry, they will probably laugh it off, especially when those who advocate are a flock of parrots whose names are not correct and whose words are not reasonable!

### Recent Work

— Hu Weizhou

His eyes watch the birth, life, death, and destruction of things, but he himself stubbornly and stubbornly lives in the turbid atmosphere of suffering.

His eyes already carry a deep sorrow.

Staying here for a long time,

is like suffering the branding of pain.

He also loved the dimpled smile, the dancing piano music, the joy of youth, but after all, it was disillusionment and the past. Today, cherishing overflowing love, he throws himself into the depths of the motherland's pain, leaping and frolicking in the clear morning of the night.

Go, quickly, catch up with the magnificent battlefield to enjoy it! Here there is the beauty of modern fire, the beauty of blood, the beauty of steel, the fragrance of gunpowder, the fragrant abundance of gas. Humanity originally evolved in struggle, go revive your youthful vitality.

Break free from everything, silently step from here onto the horse's back, without the slightest attachment to this decadent place and shout generously: We only have the vanguard!

### Random Notes on War Dogs

— Lü Ping

Ever since humanity has had wars, dogs have begun to join their ranks.

When primitive people lived in caves and the wilderness, dogs served as their guards, helping them to resist all external invasions.

The Zhou Dynasty established the official position of "Dog Handler," belonging to the category of "Harmful Elements," specifically in charge of the training of dogs. Although it cannot be confirmed that dogs were used in warfare at that time, it is clear that dogs were being trained by humans.

From murals, we can see that the Egyptians were using dogs as tools of war as early as 4000 BC. The Celts used sharp steel blades to attach to the dogs' collars, driving them to assassinate the enemy. King Henry VIII of England sent four hundred fierce dogs to Charles IX, helping the Spanish defeat the French army. As for dogs serving in modern warfare, engaging in rescue, communication, sentry duty and other tasks; it was Germany who created this in the First World War.

A dog's sense of smell and hearing can reach within half a mile, eight times more acute than humans. They have a strong memory and can recognize more than two hundred kinds of slogans.

A German army dog was used under heavy fire to find the locations of five wounded soldiers, and the soldiers were able to survive because of it. A Belgian police dog created a record of teaching two thousand people in one year.

In Belgium, war dogs are incorporated into mechanized units; using them to drag machine guns is even more reliable than war horses. In the Soviet Union, dogs wear gas masks to rush to the front lines, specializing in pulling mine carts. Each war dog can carry forty-five pounds of ammunition. If equipped with simple devices, they can also install telephone lines for convoys.

A French war dog named "Bing" can be considered one of the most glorious war dogs. In addition to being able to do the work that other war dogs can do, it can also identify the smell of poisonous gas shells, and the lives of thousands of soldiers have been saved by its warnings. Therefore, it has received many honors and awards, and it is also the first war dog to receive a state pension. When it died of old age, it was buried with military honors.

In Europe today, war dog training has become a common thing. The Ashchurch military dog school in England is the largest training ground for war dogs, with two thousand war dogs graduating each term. Other countries, such as Russia, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands, all have war dog school facilities, and there are even many hospitals specifically established for war dogs, just like hospitals for wounded soldiers.

### The Sorrow of the Old Man

— Lin Ling

The sharp, cold north wind savagely swept through the bamboo forest outside the village, and a kind of sorrowful sigh constantly spread into the distance with the wind, just like the complaints of all the unfortunate in this era of suffering.

Since yesterday, the people of this village have been fleeing like frightened birds, for who knows how many times. Perhaps the war has taught them to be smart? The women and children must all be taken away, and as for the local militia, some cowardly fled, while some brave ones entrenched themselves on the hilltop, waiting for an opportunity to kill the enemy. Those who remained, apart from some stubborn old men and some old women who were determined to defend their homes to the death, were only many ownerless livestock.

The goose's cry announced the rising sun. The group that had fled only stopped their weary steps after traveling for some distance. They looked back at the fields and houses they had left behind just the night before, twenty or thirty miles away, and only saw clouds and smoke filling the air, the distant trees and mountain peaks woven into a hazy image. A terrible riddle was painted on their hearts: What will the enemy do with our homes and belongings? But no one could give them an answer.

On this day, those old men who did not leave also did not sleep well. The village head, Yang Shangyi, that old fellow, was even preparing to welcome the enemy. Doing this job was really not easy. On the one hand, he had to entertain those messenger traitors; this didn't seem too difficult. But on the other hand, he also had to tell those young men not to resist, which was problematic. However, in any case, he had decided to do so.

The next day, as the dismal sun was about to rise, a dozen enemy soldiers arrogantly came to this village. The traitor led them straight to the village ancestral hall, where a hideous "welcome meeting" had been prepared.

Several senile old men, wearing long robes and mandarin jackets, and even wearing red hats, bowed and kowtowed three times to welcome the enemy soldiers to the banquet.

The enemy soldiers gleefully sipped their wine and, taking advantage of the alcohol, stood up with beaming smiles, muttering unintelligible sounds. Following this, a traitor, shamelessly putting on a smiling face, translated:

"The Great Imperial Army needs chickens..."

The old men in long robes and mandarin jackets hurriedly replied:

"Uh, uh, uh... good, good, good..."

"The Great Imperial Army needs pigs..."

"Uh, uh... good, good..."

"Need white rice..."

"Uh, uh... good, good..."

"Need cows..."

"Uh, uh... good, good..."

After a moment, the translating fellow said again:

"Also, need girls..."

"..."

When he said this, the old men looked at each other, silently, their faces covered with a layer of desolate gloom.

Before long, the enemy soldiers arrogantly left, giving strict instructions before leaving:

"All these things must be delivered by noon today!"

When the time came, the old men listened to a lot of people, leading cattle, carrying chickens and pigs, and carrying white rice, and sent five old men who were so-called "skilled in dispatching" as leaders - naturally, the village head was one of them. According to the location previously specified by the enemy soldiers, they presented these many "hard-earned" things to the enemy soldiers.

The time was neither early nor late, the long and short hands of the clock coincided exactly on the Arabic numeral twelve. But the enemy soldiers shouted impatiently:

"Huh, why are you so late!"

"It's just twelve o'clock, sir!" The old village head said in a gentle, womanly voice.

Another enemy soldier, with a special mark on his shoulder, probably some kind of captain, inspected the delivered items, then raised his thick eyebrows, made a face even more terrible than the devils, snorted, and then cursed:

"Why didn't you send the girls!" These words came from the mouth of that shameless traitor.

The five old men were all so frightened that their faces turned green and then white, and their beards trembled with shaking. The old village head shivered and said in a trembling voice:

"Sir, because the daughters have left, we cannot send them for a while, later..."

Before he could finish speaking, he was interrupted by an unintelligible word.

The enemy soldier with the mark on his shoulder said something to the other enemy soldiers, and several enemy soldiers responded by waving their shiny bayonets and approaching the old men whose souls were not attached to their bodies.

With a sound like a sword piercing clay, followed by several screams in the air; thus, on the desolate, withered grass, lay five withered corpses. The cold wind whistled and sang their elegy.

But the enemy soldiers, smiling, put away the delivered items and planned another new action.

### Manchurian Snow

— Shu Qun

The maidservant lowered her buttons and wiped the snow off his shoulders again. The more experienced servants were, the more they would show small acts of diligence in front of the guests; sometimes, it would not stop until it was nauseating. Like her. The guest being served by her was almost cramped from the service. Finally, he evaded her and asked:

"Where is Miss?"

"Oh, how muddle-headed! I forgot to find Miss for you, sir."

"No hurry."

"Yes, that's what I thought too. Sir, you might as well sit for a while longer. The weather outside is really cold!..."

"You should go and ask Miss to come first!"

"Yes, I'll go right away."

He called her back again. He asked:

"Where is Miss?"

"In the living room."

"Are there any other guests?"

"No. She's practicing the piano there alone. Sir, don't you know that Miss loves to play the piano? Her friends all know! Speaking of her friends, they are really too good, I have never seen a bad person. Our Miss really didn't grow those phoenix eyes for nothing, she really knows friends!" This talkative maidservant seemed to never stop talking. He listened absentmindedly, thinking:

"You talkative old woman, were you mute when you were young?" She thought her words could please the guests, but she didn't know that the result was the opposite. So she continued to say: "Speaking of her friends, they are really too good! And they all seem like big shots!" At this moment, he wanted to say:

"I look like your ancestors!"

"For example, sir, your blessed appearance must be that of someone who does great things, with both sons and daughters, all the way to old age. At that time, sir, don't forget that there is also a poor old woman here, who has talked with you." He was already angry listening to her, he wanted to shout:

"This old woman, only the genitals of a male horse can shut her mouth!" (Nine)
