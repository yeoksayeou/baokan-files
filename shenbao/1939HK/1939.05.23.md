### The Influence of the Anglo-Soviet-French Military Alliance

According to a London dispatch yesterday, the British government has officially confirmed that the United Kingdom has agreed to form a defensive military alliance with the Soviet Union; it is also rumored that France will be a member of the alliance, and Turkey is also in a position to join. In this way, the establishment of the volatile European anti-aggression front can be considered clear, and the foundation of the anti-aggression front has been completely consolidated from here. Therefore, the establishment of the Anglo-Soviet-French military alliance is of great significance. Its impact will also be very broad, not only limited to Europe, but also extending to the Far East.

According to British sources, the Soviet Union will most likely join the alliance under two conditions: first, to determine common measures for the three countries on the basis of mutual action, which means that if any one of the three countries is subjected to aggression, the other two countries should immediately come to their aid; second, with regard to guaranteeing the issues of other countries, the three countries will agree that if any other country is invaded, and has indeed tried its best to resist the aggression, and has appealed for assistance, the three countries should devote all their efforts to assist the invaded country. Judging from this content alone, the Anglo-Soviet-French military alliance will have at least the following impacts:

First, the European anti-aggression front will be soundly established on the basis of this Anglo-Soviet-French military alliance, and other small and weak countries will compete to join this alliance, or be affiliated to this alliance group, because they will have sufficient and reliable guarantees from now on. Previously, small countries in Eastern Europe, and even some small and weak countries in Northern and Eastern Europe, hesitated because the UK's past guarantees were not very reliable, and coupled with the enticement of Germany and Italy, there was a possibility of defecting to the aggressors. However, if the Soviet Union's conditions are adopted now, the guarantee can be sufficient, and they will naturally be willing to leave the tiger's den and enter a comfortable home.

Second, the Anglo-Soviet-French military alliance will greatly affect the Far East, meaning that our emphasis that the anti-aggression front must include the Far East will also develop from here. Our argument is that the alliance will stipulate that if any one of the three countries is subjected to aggression, the other two countries should immediately come to their aid, and the UK, Soviet Union, and France all have the possibility of being invaded by Eastern aggressors in the Far East. Therefore, the world's anti-aggression front cannot be limited to Europe alone. Here, because there are also many small and weak countries in the Far East that hope to be guaranteed by strong countries, and the United States' advocacy is the strongest, the United States will also very naturally join the anti-aggression front sooner or later, which will be further strengthened.

Third, the alliance groups, that is, the aggression group and the anti-aggression group, will be more centralized, and their opposing situation will be clearer, forming the opposing situation of the alliance before the First World War. The German-Italian military alliance was officially signed yesterday morning, and this situation forced the Anglo-Soviet-French military alliance. Secondly, it is expected that Germany and Italy will force Japan to join the tripartite military alliance in the near future. Again, countries with anti-aggression or being in danger of aggression will continue to join the Anglo-Soviet-French alliance group.

In this situation, the most noteworthy thing is the diplomatic trends of our × people. Their diplomatic policy up to today is indeed to establish two factions: (1) The elders and important ministers of the stable faction still do not approve of rashly joining the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance, thereby offending democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, and France. (2) However, the young military officers strongly emphasize joining. Recently, the consistent advocacy of "National News" and the active anti-British sentiment in the occupied areas of China are clear evidence of this. However, it has troubled the old man Hiranuma, who is in a dilemma, and to this day he is still ambiguous, saying that "Japan's national policy is based on justice and morality," alas!

### Recent Developments in China's Education and Culture: Continued Increase in Funding for Frontier Education and Further Advancement of Facilities

(Special dispatch from Chongqing) Since the Ministry of Education established the Mongolian-Tibetan Education Department in the 19th year of the Republic (1930), it has been actively carrying out frontier education and has achieved considerable results over the years. A summary is extracted below:

(Frontier Education Funding)

Regarding the planning and allocation of frontier education funding, the Ministry of Education and the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission discussed it several times in the 20th, 21st, and 22nd years of the Republic (1931-1933) to promote the frontier education program. In the end, the annual budget was only 50,000 yuan. In addition to the Mongolian Affairs Commission separately subsidizing the existing schools with excellent results in the frontier areas, subsidizing frontier students to study further, and providing appropriate subsidies to frontier cultural groups, there was no surplus available for distribution. The proposed plans were not realized. The Ministry of Education, in view of the complexity of the frontier issue, believed that if a cultural foundation was not established urgently, political and educational construction would be impossible. Therefore, in the 24th year of the Republic (1935), it designated 500,000 yuan within the subsidies to remote and poor provinces for the purpose of handling frontier education. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), it was increased to 640,000 yuan, designating six uses: (1) subsidizing schools with excellent results, (2) training teachers, (3) increasing the number of primary schools, (4) increasing the number of social education institutions, (5) subsidizing frontier students to study further, and (6) compiling and printing textbooks and books.

(School Education)

The frontier schools subsidized by the Ministry of Education include one Mongolian-Tibetan-Hui teacher training class attached to the Lanzhou Rural Normal School in Gansu Province, 55 primary schools, one Xining Mongolian-Tibetan Simple Normal School in Qinghai Province, two middle schools, 143 primary schools, two Mongolian Banner Normal School classes in Ningxia Province, 14 primary schools, one Kangding Simple Normal School in Xikang Province, 5 primary schools, three Border Simple Normal Schools in Yunnan Province (reported to be ten, but no detailed report has been received by the Ministry, so only those that have been reported are listed), 35 primary schools, one Guiyang Rural Normal School in Guizhou Province, 12 primary schools, two Pingshan and Maoxian Simple Normal Schools in Sichuan Province, 15 primary schools, one teacher training class in the Xiangxi Special Zone in Hunan Province, 100 short-term primary schools, five Mongolian-Hui normal school classes attached to the Dihua Normal School in Xinjiang Province, and one Aksu Simple Normal School, 1,412 primary schools, one National Suiyuan Mongolian Banner Normal School in Suiyuan Province, subsidizing one Tumote Banner Middle School, 29 primary schools, 13 Mongolian Banner Primary Schools in Chahar Province (all closed down in Chahar, only four primary schools in Suiyuan continue to operate), one special teacher training institute in Guangxi Province, 541 primary schools, and one Lhasa First Primary School in Tibet. In total, there are 12 normal schools, plus nine classes, two middle schools, and 3,270 primary schools.

(Social Education)

The social education institutions subsidized by the Ministry of Education include one Ningxia Provincial Mongolian Banner Education Touring Work Group, one Labbuleng Tibetan Cultural Promotion Association Touring Education Team, one Mongolian Cultural Center (now closed), one Chahar Second Touring Social Education Center (now closed), and one Chahar Twelve Banner Group Mongolian Translation Center (now suspended). Temple Education: In order to improve temple education, the Ministry of Education, together with the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission, issued a notice to the education departments of various border provinces and the Mongolian-Tibetan local governments to urge local temples to establish public schools or supplementary schools for the nearby people and monks to study. In Islamic mosques, Awen schools attached to them were also ordered to increase subjects such as national language knowledge and arithmetic, and to use the time of lecturing on scriptures in various temples to give spiritual lectures and carry out literacy campaigns, and to find ways to train lamas, monks, and Ahongs.

(Preferential Treatment for Students)

In order to encourage Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui students to enter specialized schools and above in the interior, the Ministry of Education has allocated special funds to subsidize them since the 25th year of the Republic (1936), with a subsidy of 300 yuan per person per year. In addition, travel expenses are also issued at the Ministry’s discretion. On average, dozens of people are subsidized each year. Cultural Lectures: In order to communicate Han-Tibetan culture, the Ministry of Education added Tibetan cultural lectures to five universities, including Central, Tsinghua, Wuhan, Sun Yat-sen, and Peking Universities, in the 26th year of the Republic (1937), and specially hired Geshe Sherab Gyatso of Tibet to teach. Textbook Compilation and Translation: The situation in the frontier is special, and the languages are different. Ordinary textbooks cannot be applied. The Ministry of Education separately compiles, translates, prints, and distributes them for application. At present, "Han-Mongolian Bilingual" textbooks, eight volumes of primary school national language, four volumes of common sense, four books of the Three Principles of the People Thousand-Character Text, four volumes of short-term primary school textbooks, "Han-Tibetan Bilingual" textbooks, four volumes of primary school national language, four volumes of public school textbooks, and three volumes of "Han-Hui Bilingual" primary school textbooks have been compiled. In addition, eight volumes of Han-Tibetan bilingual textbooks submitted by Xikang and five volumes of Han-Tibetan readers submitted by the Han-Tibetan Buddhist Academy have been reviewed, but the content is not perfect, and methods are being sought to revise them.

(Improvement Matters)

(1) "Expansion of the Scope of Frontier Education Facilities." The frontier ethnic groups are complex, the culture is backward, and the situations in various places are different. Not only the Mongolian areas must adapt to the environment to implement education, but also the Hui people in Xinjiang, the Tuban people in Qinghai, and the various ethnic groups in the southwestern border areas, their languages, customs, and habits are very different from those in the interior. We should proceed from their actual needs to promote education in various places, so that it is easier to achieve results. Therefore, the scope of work of the Mongolian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education has spread to various border areas. (2) Correct the name of mixed teaching. The purpose of frontier education is to integrate national and cultural identity. If each establishes its own name and marks punctuation, it is no different from dividing the entire Chinese nation. If students of each ethnic group are taught separately, feelings cannot be connected. Therefore, the Ministry of Education ordered various border schools to use the place name as the school name, and enroll students regardless of ethnicity, and implement mixed teaching to eliminate the boundaries between ethnic groups. (3) "Taking the national language as the center of teaching." The main reason for the emotional separation of ethnic minorities is the difference in language. Therefore, the first task of frontier education must be to make the frontier people understand the national language, so that there is no so-called barrier, which can be eliminated invisibly. (4) "Frontier education" is gradually changed from a subsidy method to direct management by the central government. Because the politics of various frontier areas are not on the right track, there are many obstacles to the promotion of frontier education. Therefore, on the one hand, the old educational institutions are being reorganized and subsidies are continuing to be provided. On the other hand, national normal schools are being gradually established to control teachers, experimental primary schools are being established to guide local education, national middle schools are being established to absorb young people, border schools are being established to cultivate construction talents, and frontier schools are being established as the center for researching and promoting education in various regions. In this way, frontier education can be gradually controlled by the central government, so that it can proceed smoothly under a certain plan and direction.

Adult Education

Guangxi Pays Attention to Promotion, Which Other Provinces Can Emulate

[Guilin Correspondence] Liujiang is a very important county among the ninety-nine counties in Guangxi. The total area of the county is 7,182 square miles, divided into five towns and thirty townships, 429 villages and streets, and a population of over 238,800. Among them, there are 18,767 adults who have dropped out of school (according to the statistics in March of the 27th year of the Republic (1938)). After the Liujiang County Government was ordered to hold adult education, it decided on the following seven methods.

Establish a Promotion Committee

(1) Establish a promotion adult education committee. The committee was officially announced this month and is specifically responsible for promoting adult education, striving to eliminate illiteracy, popularize public education, strengthen public mobilization, and exert the power of the war of resistance and national construction within this year. (2) Publicity: Village and street chiefs, school teachers, and enthusiastic educators will work hard to publicize the importance of adult education at village and street people's congresses or other gatherings. The Liuzhou Daily has also published a "Special Issue on Adult Education for War," expanding publicity to encourage the public to actively participate in group activities.

Train Adult Education Teachers

(3) Training of teachers: There are a total of 429 villages and streets in the county, and each village and street must have one full-time adult education teacher, requiring a total of 429 adult education teachers. Moreover, because this year's adult education is different from the past narrow literacy campaign and remedial education, it is necessary to establish a teacher training class for teachers and conduct short-term training for all teachers. In the first phase, in addition to separately transferring teachers from township primary schools for training, an examination system will be implemented to select true talents. It is estimated that more than 160 teachers will be trained in this phase. The class has already started. After completing the class and training for ten days, they will go to the villages and streets of the township to take on adult education work. (4) Establishment of adult education classes: There are a total of 429 villages and streets in the county. Each village and street is scheduled to set up one or two adult classes, with one full-time teacher, with a monthly living allowance of 10 yuan in national currency. After the two classes are over, there will be an additional subsidy of 5 yuan in national currency. The number of people is stipulated to be at least 30 people per class and no more than 60 people. (5) Establishment of model adult classes: This is stipulated in Article 8 of the adult education program of this province. Each county should specially invite secondary schools and central schools with excellent performance to hold model adult classes to set an example for other schools. Now, the county has decided that the Liuzhou Provincial Junior High School and the private Longcheng Junior High School will each establish a model adult class as an example for other schools. (To be continued)

### Japanese Economic Plunder in North China (Continued from Yesterday)

In addition to excessive issuance of paper money, they also try their best to absorb it. There are also many ways to absorb it. Gu Yina Huaxiong, the head of the Taiyuan Special Affairs Agency, announced: Chinese Bank and Bank of Communications banknotes circulating in the market, except those printed with Tianjin, Qingdao, and guerrilla designations, must be exchanged for banknotes of the Chinese Reserve Bank before June 10 (last year). But in reality, the Chinese people's distrust of counterfeit banknotes has negated the effectiveness of this method. The common people would rather hoard them at home than exchange them for counterfeit money. Therefore, the Japanese method of absorbing legal tender can only rely on exorbitant taxes and wanton plunder.

B. Establishing Agricultural Loan Institutions:

The widespread establishment of agricultural loan institutions by the Japanese in various places is also, in fact, for the purpose of carrying out exploitation.

In June of last year, the puppet Hebei Provincial Bank handled agricultural loans in Cang County, Hebei, investing a total of 150,000 yuan. Farmers who borrowed money had to follow the established regulations, using land deeds as collateral, and repay the loans within a limited time. If they failed to repay the loans by the deadline, the land would be confiscated.

How could the vast majority of farmers under the oppression of exorbitant taxes imposed by the Japanese be able to repay loans with interest doubled on time? As a result, their land was only confiscated by the Japanese.

II. In the Industrial Sphere

A. The Puppet Provisional Government Restructuring Existing Mining Rights:

In June of last year, the puppet provisional government abolished all the provisions of the current mining law revised in the 21st year of the Republic of China. According to the original regulations, more than half of the shares of a mining company must be owned by Chinese, more than half of the directors and the chairman and general manager must be Chinese, and coal, steel, copper, kerosene, etc., should be state-owned in principle... These regulations, of course, hindered the Japanese economic conspiracy. The puppet provisional government, using the excuse that "these regulations are exclusionary," simply abolished them all! Existing mining rights were completely dissolved, and a fake "Mining Law Ordinance" was re-promulgated. The transfer of mining rights and other related dispositions are invalid without the special permission of the puppet government. Therefore, all coal and iron mines and other enterprises operated by tens of thousands of people were completely transferred to the Japanese.

B. Actively Developing Industries in North China:

In May of last year, the puppet Japan-China Economic Association drafted concrete plans for developing industries in North China. The following is a special introduction:

1. "Rural Rehabilitation Plan"

The North China Rural Development Nine-Year Plan aims to increase cotton production by 10 million dan and wheat production by 128 million dan...

2. Cooperative Organization Plan:

The North China Agricultural Implementation Agency Cooperative is a unit cooperative based on each village. Above it are the county federation, the provincial federation, and the central federation, forming a systematic cooperative organization. The Department of Industry and the Xinmin Association are responsible for technical guidance.

3. Cotton Production Increase Plan:

Establish the North China Cotton Production Association as a direct guidance and incentive agency responsible for implementing the cotton production increase plan, and decide on the "Nine-Year Production Increase Plan."

4. Agricultural Experiment Station Unification Plan:

The agricultural experiment stations formerly scattered in various provinces will be integrated and reorganized under the management of the provinces or counties, and placed under the control of the Cultural Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to improve agriculture..."

5. Industries in North China, such as transportation, communications, electricity, iron ore, coal mining, salt production, soda industry, and coal liquefaction, are of crucial importance and are designated as controlled joint ventures.

6. Welcome the participation of third-country funds.

In September of last year, the puppet Japan-China Economic Association decided on three items of the "Economic Cooperation Outline" at its fourth meeting: 1. Increase cotton production, 2. Promote trade, and 3. Develop industries. In the item of developing industries, it specifically pointed out that "the five important industries in North China, coal, iron, electricity, salt, and coal liquefaction, must be developed as much as possible." These five industries are necessities for military industry, which shows the Japanese preparation for a long-term war of aggression. In addition to this, the development of other industries also has wartime characteristics. The purpose of the Japanese is, on the one hand, for exploitation, and on the other hand, for military purposes. Now, we will briefly describe the Japanese industrial institutions that have been established in several provinces in North China and the exploitation situation to show the conspiracy of Japanese economic aggression.

(1) Coal Mines: The salt deposits in North China's coal reserves are the richest, with Shanxi being the foremost. The coal quality is divided into bituminous coal and anthracite. The production areas are divided into those inside and outside Niangziguan. The coal produced in Jingxing and other places outside the pass is "bituminous coal," commonly known as "smoky coal." The coal produced in Yangquan and other places inside the pass is "anthracite." After the fall of Taiyuan, the Japanese actively mined it. Last year, it was assigned to the management of the Fourth Factory under the puppet army. After the factory took over the Yangquan Baojin Company, it divided the mining area managed by the factory into fourteen areas, and recruited a large number of workers to actively excavate.

The coal mining area of Dongshan Xishan near Taiyuan also has quite rich reserves. It belongs to the Fifth Factory developed by the puppet army. After the Japanese implemented an economic blockade in October last year, they designated the puppet Liu Da Company as the sole agent for exclusive sales. The Liu Da Company opened a large coal storage factory outside the Shouyi Gate in Taiyuan to operate sales.

The Datong Kouquan Coal Mine in northern Shanxi is managed by the puppet North Autonomous Government. The Fujia Coal Mine between Ling Shi in Jinan County is also designated as the Forty-Second Factory under the puppet army, preparing for excavation.

Hebei is also quite rich in coal production. The Japanese have a close relationship with the Kailuan Yanhmei and the ironmaking industry. In September of last year, they invested 5 million yuan and formulated a production increase plan. The current annual production volume is more than 5 million tons.

The Shandong coal mines along the Jiaoji Railway are all managed by the puppet Qingdao Luda Mining Company. The company also took over the various coal mines formerly managed by Chinese businessmen. In the past, the company's annual production volume reached more than 3 million tons. After the Incident, sales were hindered, and it dropped to about 1 million tons. Recently, the Japanese decided to revive it and invested 7 million yuan. The monthly coal output of each mining area is currently 400 tons in Boshan, 800 tons in Dakunlun, 200 tons in Hongshan, and about 500 tons in Pule, Kengzi, etc. (2) Iron Ore: The Japanese attach great importance to the mining of iron ore. At the end of the twenty-sixth year, the Siyekou Xingzhong Company began to develop the Xuanhua and Longyan iron mines, and established a company management in the Yanjianshan mining area, expanding the material factory as well. In addition, they also mined ore in the Sanxakou-Xinyao mining area under Longguan County.

In addition, the Japanese deeply felt the need for iron ore. In November of last year, the Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Okura companies extensively collected scrap iron, ancient bronze, coins, scrap lead, shell casings, etc. in various parts of North China. The collection was extremely large.

(3) Gold Mines: The gold mine in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, is extremely rich in reserves. In the past, during the Jidong government era, there were many small-scale mining companies. However, due to weak capital and the use of indigenous methods, they were almost completely shut down. In July of last year, the Xingzhong Company and the Sumitomo Corporation jointly formed a North China Gold Mining Company, which was established in Tianjin to engage in the mining of gold mines in Zunhua.

In the past, the gold mine in Dai County, Shanxi Province, was also mined using indigenous methods. It is heard that recently the Japanese have sent technicians from a certain company to conduct a thorough investigation. It is thought that they also have excavation plans.

(4) Electrical Undertakings: The Japanese have not developed any electrical undertakings in North China. Recently, the Japanese claimed that they will establish an "Electricity Committee" in Beiping. There has been a slight improvement in the electrical aspects. In July of last year, telegraphic contact began between Chahar-Suiyuan, Manchuria, and North China. However, the contact method relies not only on the external telecommunications contact method adopted by the Directorate General of Posts, but also on the wireless telegraphs of the Zhangjiakou and Datong telegraph offices for contact between Chahar-Suiyuan and Manchuria. For contact between North China and Suiyuan-Chahar, the original telegraph lines between Zhangjiakou and Beiping are used. Later, in September, a two-layer automatic telegraph line was erected between Zhangjiakou and Chengde.

Petroleum, the raw material necessary for the electrical undertakings, is controlled by the Japanese. In July of last year, the "North China Petroleum Control Company" was established, purchasing the old Dahua Petroleum Company and purchasing crude oil for refining and sale.

(5) Salt: The Changlu Salt Field, which has been a case for a long time, was decided by the Xingzhong Company to be developed in June of last year. The plan is to develop a new salt field of 5,000 '町步' (chōbu), and the capacity of the salt washing factory will also be increased. In early July, the abandoned salt flats of Dongda Gaozi Salt Ziqiaonan were also reorganized, and it was scheduled that salt could be officially produced in the spring of last year.

Since the Japanese controlled salt, the people have felt a lack of salt. At the same time, under the deception and oppression of Japanese merchants, market prices have risen sharply, and it has become difficult for the people to eat salt. Since last year, in the coastal areas of Hebei, farmers in Cang County, Yanshan, and other places have mostly made saltpeter privately. People nearby scrambled to sell it. Later, it was discovered by the Japanese, who thought that it greatly affected the sales of Changlu Salt, and they completely confiscated the salt fields and salt ponds in various places. The Xingzhong Company also decided to use the original salt farmers in the Cangyan area to develop industrial salt, which would be specially supplied to domestic 亶達 industrial, nitrate, and all chemical industries.

The Yuncheng Salt Pond in Shanxi has a large production capacity. In the past, in addition to supplying Jinan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, and other places also relied on it. In March of last year, the Japanese occupied Yuncheng and completely confiscated the Hedong Salt from the salt pond. They also recruited workers to engage in production, but because the area around the salt pond was where our guerrillas haunted, the working hours of the general salt workers and the area of the salt fields they worked on were not far away. Therefore, the production volume was not high. Currently, most of the edible salt in Shanxi is still Changlu Salt.

There is also a lot of salt produced along the coast of Shandong. Qingdao, especially near the sea, produces more salt. The annual export volume of Qingdao salt to Japan and Korea reaches about 1,000 tons.

(6) Agricultural Products: In addition to the above-mentioned departments, the agricultural development of North China is also actively underway. The Japanese lack food and attempt to collect it from China. Therefore, after seizing Chahar-Suiyuan, the puppet Meng district United Weaving Association and the puppet Chanan Menglian Jinbei three autonomous governments first amended the land law and land consolidation law, setting a three-year plan. Each puppet government set up a central test.

In Taiyuan, since the beginning of July last year, the export of miscellaneous boxes has been controlled, and a "Miscellaneous Grain Transportation Association" has been established, but in fact, it is all manipulated by the Japanese. Chinese merchants who joined the association all lost money. Later, the Chinese merchants repeatedly requested that many exports be made outside of the members of the association, but they were all rejected. As a result, most of the Chinese merchants withdrew from the association, but secretly transported food to the guerrilla areas. The Japanese felt panicked about food and often sent soldiers to the countryside to plunder. This is a serious military problem that the Japanese feel most anxious about.

(7) Cotton Production: Cotton products are also one of the military supplies. The Japanese have always relied heavily on China. After capturing Hebei, they set up the "Hebei Cotton Production Improvement Association" and formulated a five-year production increase plan, established the "North China Cotton Company," and actively reorganized cotton markets and factories in Zhengding, Zhangde, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, and other places.

The Japanese did not expect that most of the Chinese people would participate in the war. Although they worked hard, the result was that the production volume in the year after the war was far less than before the Incident. Supply could not meet demand, and cotton prices soared. The price of North China cotton delivered in Osaka was about 1,000 yuan higher than that of American cotton. The Japanese tried to increase exports to Japan several times, but the result was a complete trade export cutoff. The Japanese are at their wit's end, as can be seen from this.

At the end of last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Special Affairs Bureau of the puppet provisional government planned to establish a North China Cotton Production Increase Guidance Agency, with the general headquarters in Beiping and branch offices in various provinces. Branch offices will also be established in various counties, and it is planned to be established this year.

(8) Flour: The Taiyuan puppet army manages the Second and Seventh factories, the former sites of the Electric Light Company and the Flour Company, to supply flour to various puppet military and political institutions in Shanxi. Although the current output is not as high as in the past, the Japanese often do not have to publicly purchase wheat when they buy small wheat, so they can of course make a profit. This is the general method used by the Japanese.

In addition to Taiyuan, there are still three flour factories set up in Shanxi. Linfen is the Thirty-First Factory managed by the puppet army, equipped with decorative electric wheels. Zaoyuan is the Thirtieth Factory managed by the puppet army, which is smaller in scale and has only dozens of workers. Yuci (outside the North Gate, the old Jinfeng Flour Factory) is also assigned to the Twelfth Factory managed by the puppet army. In December of last year, the Seventh Factory managed by the puppet army repaired and restored the Second Factory of the old Jinfeng Flour Company in Yuncheng, and attempted to start production recently.

Among the largest flour factories in the Japanese-occupied area of Shandong, the Qingdao Sanji Flour Company of the Mitsui Group is the most important. Currently, Sanji's directly affiliated factories include the Qingdao, Jinan, and Tianjin factories. The factories whose operations have already been entrusted to it include the Jiazhiyan in Jinan, and the Zhongyang and Shuangfu factories in Qingdao.

(9) Tobacco and Alcohol: After the War of Resistance, 19 of the paper cigarette companies in Pingjin went bankrupt because most of the raw materials for various paper cigarettes were collected from the interior. After the widespread development of guerrilla warfare, it became impossible to transport raw materials to the Japanese-occupied areas, so the companies were unable to work due to lack of raw materials. At the same time, they were unable to exist under the strong seizure and theft of the Japanese. As a result, they could only go bankrupt. The general price increase of paper cigarettes is based on this reason.

The Pingjin liquor industry is also the same. Chinese liquor merchants have gradually disappeared, and the imported Western liquor has also decreased compared to before. Almost all the liquor flooding the market is imported from Japan, especially the Kirin and Asahi brands.

In September of last year, the Kowa Tobacco Company of North China initiated the organization of the North China Tobacco Control Company, with the general headquarters in Qingdao and offices in Beiping and Tokyo. The buying and selling of tobacco leaves, the warehousing industry, and the management of the transportation industry are all controlled and operated by the puppet company. At the same time, the puppet Shandong Tobacco Co., Ltd. was also established in Shandong, with Sunguo Haruhi, a Japanese national, as the chairman. It was jointly formed by the East Asia and Manchuria Tobacco Companies.

Shanxi tobacco leaves also adopted control methods, and the import of silk cigarettes from other provinces was prohibited. The 13th Factory managed by the puppet army (the former site of the Jinhua Cigarette Factory) was extremely meticulously operated, but due to lack of raw materials and stagnation of sales, the business was in a very dilapidated state. The brands produced include Xu, Liming, Xiehe, and Xingfu. They are sealed in beautiful packaging boxes with propaganda pictures, and injected with drugs. In June of last year, the public ate and smoked. Such cigarettes often caused death from poisoning. The danger of the Japanese conspiracy has reached this point.

(10) Alcohol and Foreign Coal: Among the alcohol factories with a slightly larger scale in North China, the Datong Alcohol Factory is the most important. The puppet Jinbei Autonomous Government reorganized the alcohol manufacturing factory operated by the Northwest Industrial Company, renaming it the "Jinbei Xingnong Alcohol Factory." It began operations in early August last year. The local puppet organization tried its best to collect beans, sorghum, and corn as raw materials for manufacturing.

In the past, the North China cement industry was mostly monopolized by the Tangshan Qixin Cement Company. The annual output was about 300,000 tons or more. After the incident, due to security and transportation, its output was greatly reduced. In Taiyuan, the Japanese entrusted the operation of the old Northwest Cement Plant to the Asano Cement Company. It is currently under repair. In Jinan, the Zhijing Cement Company was also taken over by the 盤城灰 Company, but the output is very small.

(11) Match Industry: In November of last year, the puppet provisional government of Beiping drafted a concrete plan for the "Match Joint Operation Society." The outline is divided into three points: (1) Restricting production, (2) Banning smuggled goods, and (3) Centralized sales. However, its purpose is nothing more than to control the entire North China match enterprise. Qingdao is the most developed place for matches. The North China Match Factory, the Zhenye Match Factory, and the Qingqing Match Company have all been exclusively occupied by Japanese merchants. They started operations in September of last year. Most of the weaves in the Pingjin area are sent here.

Among the largest scale of the Qingdao Match Company and other scale companies, the "North China Match Company" is the largest. It was reorganized from the former Qingdao Match Company. The chairman is Utagawa, a Japanese national, and the vice chairman is Yang Zungui.

(12) Leather and Wool: The North China leather is most prevalent in Suiyuan. Now that the military is busy, leather, wool, and military necessities are very important, so the Japanese attach great importance to the livestock industry in Jin-Sui. The purpose is to grab large amounts of leather and wool for his combat needs.

Due to the importance of leather and wool, attention is paid to livestock. The Japanese conduct control methods as usual. In August of last year, the Civil Affairs Department of the puppet Chanan government prohibited the export of livestock. While instructing various police agencies to strictly monitor, it also set up a livestock monitoring station at the Kangzhuang Station on the Ping-Sui line to strictly prohibit private entry and exit.

The exclusive purchase right for the control of West sheepskins belongs to the 16th Factory managed by the puppet army (the former site of the Northwest Industrial Company Woolen Factory). A purchasing headquarters is set up in the factory, and purchasing offices are set up in Yuci, Xin County, Pingyao, Xinjiang, Quwo, Xiaoyi and other counties. The purchase price is determined by the Japanese Special Affairs Bureau in Taiyuan. If the factory does not need it, the rest can be exported, but it must be implemented with the permission of the Japanese Special Affairs Bureau.

Shanxi's leather production is the first in North China. In 1936, there were 2,454,000 pieces of cowhide and 8,956,000 pieces of sheepskin. Due to the Japanese conspiracy to capture and provide for military supplies, the purchase office has been entrusted to the 17th Factory managed by the puppet army (the site of the Northwest Industrial Public Company), and purchasing branch offices have been set up in Yuci, Shouyang, Fenyang, Linfen, Xinjiang, and other places. The transaction is mainly bartering. When the goods arrive, gold tickets are exchanged. Leather is an important military raw material, so it is necessary to contact the Japanese military authorities during the purchase and follow the instructions and orders of the Japanese army.

The Construction Department of the puppet provincial government of Shandong established the "Livestock Breeding Improvement Farm" in September of last year, and also set up a livestock disease prevention and control institute, but because the scale is very small, there are no achievements.

Finally

Looking at the various conspiracies of the Japanese in North China, in the economic sphere, they are intensifying the exploitation and development of the resources and wealth of the occupied areas, and at the same time using various methods to destroy and disrupt China's economy and finance, in order to destroy the material basis of China's resistance. In international trade, after the Japanese seized control of customs and key transportation routes, they tried their best to exclude British and American commerce and dumped Japanese goods. In the financial sphere, they tried their best to issue counterfeit banknotes of the United Reserve Bank, forced the people to use them, and pursued the exchange of sand coins, attempting to buy legal tender and counterfeit legal tender for private exchange of foreign exchange, and forcibly set the exchange rate of counterfeit currency, hoping to disrupt China's gold standard. This is the general conspiracy of the Japanese economic strategy. The department of aggression belongs to the activities of the Japanese company and has considerable achievements, as far as far. It belongs to the secret nature, although it is actively planned, and there is no result, so it is temporarily absent. Wait for the next day to continue. (Minge Society)

### British, American, and French Consuls in Xiamen Protest to × Consul, Demanding Rapid Withdrawal of Landing × Troops, × Consul's Reply Still Evasive

[Gulanyu, 22nd] External Dispatch: The Consular representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France jointly lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul in Xiamen yesterday, stating that the Japanese side, under the pretext of suppressing terrorist activities, has dispatched troops to forcibly occupy the Gulangyu International Settlement in order to attack the Chinese army defense line on land. The dispatch from the three powers demanded the prompt withdrawal of Japanese troops and the restoration of the settlement to its pre-occupation state. The main points of the protest letter are as follows: (1) Anti-Japanese terrorist incidents in the settlement are not as prevalent as the Japanese side claims. Before the Japanese troops landed, only two incidents occurred, one of which was committed by a Taiwanese person. Since the landing of Japanese troops, the order and tranquility of the settlement have been disrupted by the illegal searches and arrests of Japanese patrols. (2) The Japanese side claims that the landing of Japanese troops is to protect Japanese residents and pro-Japanese elements, which is merely a pretext to build machine gun positions on Gulangyu to attack the Chinese army positions on the mainland opposite the island. (3) The need for protection of residents is not limited to Japan. If the original state is not immediately restored, other relevant countries will take effective measures to protect the residents, interests, and rights under law of their respective countries on the island. The Japanese Consul in Xiamen, Uchida, has already replied to this protest, but his reply remains evasive and provides no definite answers.

### Public Places in Beiping Forbid Discussion of Current Affairs, Attempting to Deceive the Public

[Reuters, Beijing Dispatch] The local police bureau has ordered each branch bureau to select officers to patrol public places and prohibit criticism of current affairs. Those who "deliberately spread rumors to disrupt public order" may be arrested. This measure is clearly an attempt to deceive the public, fearing that news of Chinese victories will spread among the people, and also to conceal the Japanese army's × actions.

### Shaanxi Middle School Students Volunteer to Kill ×

The students have joined the ×× unit, and the military command has issued a commendation order.

### Central Commemoration Week, Yu Youren Reports on the Current Situation

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] Committee Member Yu Youren reported at the Central Commemoration Week on the 22nd, stating in essence that the flames of the War of Resistance over the past two years have forged the scattered Chinese nation into iron. The recently convened production conference is like the engine of a huge machine. The President's instructions, President Kong's speech, and the suggestions of various experts at the conference have already demonstrated the highest principles and implementation steps for our production and construction. This is the great gain of this production conference. He concluded that war is cruel but also the mother of culture. Therefore, he hoped that scholars, experts, and all working compatriots across the country would mobilize their spirits, work hard to produce, and strive to create a new China of culture, which will soon arrive.

### Severe Disaster in Northern Jiangsu, Han Deqin Requests Funds for Relief

[Central News Agency, Somewhere in Northern Jiangsu, 20th] Chairman Han, in order to provide relief for the water and war disasters in Northern Jiangsu, after consultation with Audit Commissioner Cheng Jingsheng, allocated 350,000 yuan from the 100,000 yuan allocated by the Central Government, together with 331,500 yuan in wax funds from the International Relief Committee. This will be used for relief during the winter and spring. However, the disaster situation in various places has expanded, the number of refugees has increased sharply, and the restoration of Mufu County, which suffered particularly heavy damage, requires more assistance. He requested the Central Government to allocate an additional 200,000 yuan to be used as special funds for central government consolation to the recovered counties. Mr. Han has also telegraphed the Central Government for instructions.

### Shanghai × Attempts to Revise Tax Rates Again, Excluding European and American Goods, Forcibly Burning British Goods in Occupied Areas, Instructing Puppets to Expel British Residents

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] Shanghai dispatch: After the entire tariff of our customs was altered once under the pressure of the × side on June 1st of last year, it is now learned that the × side is not satisfied with this and will once again alter the entire tariff of the Jianghai Customs, further reducing the tax rate on × goods entering the country. If this matter materializes, the goods of European and American countries will be completely excluded from the Chinese market. Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States are paying close attention to this.

[Reuters, Shanghai Dispatch] Burning British goods has become a regular activity in the anti-British movement in Japanese-occupied areas of China. In some cities, they have even gone so far as to search houses for British goods. The supporters of this movement claim that the United Kingdom is responsible for the current Sino-Japanese War. This move is clearly instructed by the Japanese military authorities. The puppet government in Nanjing under the command of the Japanese military is the puppet of this movement, expressing the need to prevent British influence from penetrating China. There are three steps to this movement: (1) Instilling anti-British education in the Chinese people. (2) Boycotting British goods. (3) Expelling British missionaries and merchants from the country. Although the third task mentioned above is still pending, the puppets responding to this movement hope to first lay a certain foundation, shouting anti-British slogans at anti-British rallies.

× Sabotages the Settlement, Three Consuls Issue Warning

[Shanghai, 22nd] The British, American, and French Consuls jointly issued a warning to the × side yesterday, demanding that the × side immediately cease all illegal sabotage activities in the settlement, otherwise the United Kingdom, the United States, and France would take direct and effective action to protect the safety of the settlement.

Shops in the Settlement Receive Intimidation Letters from ×

In the past two days, various shops in the settlement have successively received intimidation letters from the × side printed in ink, stating that all shops must accept the counterfeit banknotes of the Huaxing Bank from today and must not discriminate against them, otherwise drastic measures will be taken. The various shops believe that this move by the × side is clearly intended to disrupt our financial system and sabotage commerce in the settlement. They have reported to the police and requested their utmost protection. They have also reported to the Chamber of Commerce and will convene an emergency joint meeting soon to discuss countermeasures. As a result, they unanimously resolved to firmly refuse to use counterfeit banknotes and to not fear any intimidation.

Results of Search in the Settlement Reportedly Lead to Multiple Arrests

[Reuters, Shanghai, 22nd] The settlement authorities are remaining silent regarding the results of the large-scale search of residents by military and police personnel on Friday. According to usually reliable sources, twelve people were arrested. It is heard that they are related to politics and are engaged in anti-Japanese activities in the Shanghai settlement. Among them, eight people were arrested in the French Concession, and four people were arrested in the International Settlement.

× Forbids Residents from Moving from Yuyuan Road Area in Shanghai

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] Shanghai dispatch: In the alleyways of the Yuyuan Road area in western Shanghai, × military police suddenly erected wooden signs at the entrances and exits, posting announcements prohibiting residents from moving, otherwise they would be dealt with under military law.

### The Ta Mei Evening News and Morning Post Continue to Struggle

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 22nd] The American-owned Ta Mei Evening News continues to publish and struggle, even after its morning post, Ta Mei News, was banned from distribution by the authorities of the two settlements. It also sent a telegram to Secretary of State Hull in Washington, urging him to quickly stop the illegal interference of the two settlements in Shanghai.

### Sketches of Haifeng

— Xiao Ming

Haifeng is a major county in the Dongjiang region. During the revolutionary era, it had some amazing feats. When the Guanghui-Shantou highway was ×, the market was prosperous. × People scolded travelers if they were going to Shantou (or from Shantou to Guangzhou), they must stay here for one night, and then catch the car early in the morning. Unfortunately, after the landing of the Japanese × people at Daya Bay, the highway was destroyed, and it was difficult for the market to return to its former prosperity.

The author recently made a brief stay in the county and will do his best to provide readers with an honest and concise report on the local customs, culture, and education. Although the report contains more pessimism than optimism, the author still fervently hopes that local authorities and Haifeng's professionals will be able to jointly overcome difficulties and move towards the road of construction!

I. Culture, Education, and Construction in Haifeng

Haifeng's local taxes are levied heavily, but its culture, education, and construction are all beyond people's expectations. Haifeng County only has one bookstore. The bookstore also sells old clothes. The glass cabinet is full of books, ancient texts, Tang poems, and large-sized books on history and classics. I × bought a "Sing Together" songbook. I searched the entire Haifeng County but couldn't find it. From this, it can be seen how low the county's cultural level is. Magazines certainly need not be mentioned. Even newspapers such as Hong Kong's Shen Bao and Ta Kung Pao are not available for single purchase. The total number of Hong Kong newspapers subscribed to in the county is less than 30 copies. The entire × has a Kuomintang branch that publishes a Republic of China Daily (a four-page newspaper, most of the news is reprinted from Shantou newspapers and Hong Kong newspapers). Other culturally related undertakings (radios, movies, public sports grounds, etc.) are mostly lacking.

Haifeng County's education funds were usually 170,000 yuan per year. After the outbreak of the South China War, it was reduced to more than 70,000 yuan. Now, it is said that because the tax × is known to be inept, the education funds in the county's budget for the 28th year account for only more than 30,000 yuan. From this budget, we can imagine the state of education in the entire Haifeng County. Even 30,000 yuan is not enough to run a junior high school, and this 30,000 yuan is still the entire county's education funding. How can education be popularized among the people of Haifeng? How can illiteracy be eliminated? Although Haifeng has a Mass Education Center, it is also limited by funding and cannot make any great contribution to mass education. Furthermore, Haifeng's primary school teachers only receive 9 yuan per month for food (this refers to county-run primary schools). I don't know how many primary schools there are in Haifeng County. As for district-run and township-run primary schools, it is said that teachers can only get a maximum of 50 yuan per semester. It is said that middle school teachers are only volunteers (Haifeng County only has one junior high school and one fisheries school). With such meager treatment of teachers, how can they have the spirit to teach?

Haifeng has many × fields and wasteland. If someone were to cultivate them, I think it would increase a lot of income every year. Unfortunately, the local propertied class is abandoning this natural and excellent environment. Nine-tenths of Haifeng County's mountains are bare. Why not promote a large-scale afforestation movement? Because there are too few trees, Haifeng, although close to the sea, has a cold climate ×. It means Central ×, wind disasters, and floods. There is no year to be great.

The local people are very conservative ×. The buildings of the shops are at most two stories high. It is said that the reason why the general wealthy families dare not build Western-style buildings is because they have seen Chen Jiongming's Western-style buildings become dilapidated ruins. They believe that Haifeng's land is not suitable for building large Western-style buildings!

I am very reluctant to criticize the local authorities in the Liaodong area, because it is really disappointing. Taking Haifeng's construction as an example, the sounds of repairing the road have been going on for more than a year, but the road cement is still breaking day by day. Not long ago, a Councilor Yao from the ×th War Zone Command came to Haifeng to inspect and saw workers repairing the road. Three days later, Councilor Yao × went to Yuning, and the people repairing the road also disappeared.

II. Haifeng's Customs, Habits, and Products

Living near Guangzhou, I suddenly rushed to Haifeng and felt that there were many facts worth reporting. For example, the local dialect is called "Hoklo," and there is one word that is completely different from Cantonese. Cantonese calls a person beautiful "gwaan" (觀), while here they call a person beautiful "seui" (衰). Cantonese friends should pay attention to the use of this word when they first come to Haifeng to avoid misunderstandings!

Speaking of social interactions, in Haifeng, the great principle of "men and women should not touch hands when giving and receiving" is emphasized. Even if you meet a female classmate from the same school and class on the street, even if you are willing to greet her, she will bow her head and not look at you. Naturally, women receive even more old × education. Although the sign of the Women's Association is nailed up, the work cannot be carried out. × (To be continued)

### Brave Men of Southern Fujian Cross the Sea in Light Boats, Night Raid Kinmen, × Troops Wake Up in Terror and Are Mostly Annihilated, Officers Award and Console the Triumphant Return

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 21st] The islands of Kinmen and Xiamen in southern Fujian are isolated in the sea and have been occupied by × invaders for a year. Our coastal military and civilians have been attacking the violent × and are filled with endless hatred. Brave and enthusiastic warriors × Tie ×, Chen Dayuan, and others, ×× organized a brave death squad. On the evening of the 20th of last month, taking advantage of the dark night, they crossed the sea in small boats and launched the first daring raid on Kinmen × bandits. That night, the moon was dark and the tide was surging. It took four hours to cross the Kinmen Strait and reach the other shore. After landing, they split into three teams. One team was responsible for destruction, pretending to be a decoy force. Another team went straight to the red Western-style building in Guan'ao, which was occupied by ××. They immediately killed the × sentry and × arrived downstairs. They concentrated their firepower to fire, and the sounds of machine guns and grenades were simultaneous. The × troops woke up from their dreams, panicked and fought back. In the dim light, they were annihilated for the most part. As our brave men retreated, they suddenly heard women waking up and screaming upstairs. The third team sneaked to the southeast corner of the city and took swift action, breaking into the × army's No. 10 barrack. They immediately killed 14 × soldiers, destroyed their artillery and supplies, and withdrew calmly. They boarded the boat together. As they moved away from the shore, they heard gunfire and artillery fire erupting on the island. Our brave men returned in triumph. In this operation, they captured two light machine guns, six rifles, two steel helmets, two × flags, six bayonets, six military uniforms, 142 bullets, and many other symbols and documents. The × troops annihilated were the 24th Company of the Onishi unit of the Sasebo Second Special Naval Landing Force. The names of those who can be verified are Hirabi, Pi Quan, Hasegawa, Yoshinari Kono, Tokuju Ueno, Sugimoto, Iwai Kozo, Hayashi × zo, Ito, and other 14 people, all of whom were ordinary seamen. The × troops annihilated in the Western-style building are not included. Our brave and heroic warriors only lost Zheng Liang and Chen Fu. After receiving the news, our officers commended and consoled them separately to show their sincere loyalty.

### "Anti-Aggression Movement" in Kunming

— Chen Shih-huai

[People's Revolutionary Society, Kunming Dispatch] Kunming, a key rear area, has had to bear the heavy responsibility of maintaining the rear due to the concentration of national commerce, culture, etc. there since the War of Resistance. Therefore, on May 13th, the Kunming City and County Air Raid Emergency Relief Joint Fundraising Office held a propaganda meeting in the Provincial Kuomintang Headquarters Auditorium. Anti-Air Defense Commander Lu Jie decided to carry out large-scale propaganda in the urban and rural areas on the 14th and 15th, respectively. On the 15th, the "China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression League Kunming Branch" also held its inaugural meeting. The establishment of this powerful organization to resist violent × in Kunming is of great significance. More than 800 people from various groups, agencies, schools, and provincial, municipal, and county Kuomintang Headquarters attended. First, Chairman Chen Chongren reported: "The establishment of the China Branch of the Anti-Aggression Movement League Kunming Branch is of great significance. On the one hand, it will convey the ××××××× methods to the world, so that all friendly countries in the world can understand and further give us sympathy and help. On the other hand, the purpose of the × people today is to make us suffer great sacrifices and threats, and to make us submit and be subjected to their oppression and exploitation. However, this continued result can only strengthen our determination to resist the war, and the × people have no effect to speak of. Therefore, we will also declare all this to the world and × report to the Geneva Headquarters. Vengeance for our compatriots and sanctions for ×× are the great significance of the Anti-Aggression League."

The Secretary-General then gave a brief speech on the topic of "The Current International Situation and Our Mission." Mr. Luo Wengan, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, further developed his grand theory from the historical perspective of China. He said: "Historically speaking, our country had the theories of 'non-aggression' and 'light troops' during the Spring and Autumn Period, which is the same as the meaning of anti-aggression today.

After Director Xi gave a speech, he read out the telegrams to the Geneva Headquarters and the China Branch, which were approved by applause from the audience. Our cry of "fighting for justice and humanity" and "fighting for the maintenance of world peace" will certainly inspire international people to further sanction international ×× aggressors, and the conference sent a telegram to Generalissimo Chiang and the front-line generals to pay tribute.

"The establishment of the China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement League in Kunming today has a great historical mission, because it is a link in the global anti-aggression movement... Everyone stands on the same line and unites to resist the aggression of × day... Strive for the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation and safeguard world peace!" This solemn declaration was also passed in warm applause.

Although it has been raining non-stop in Kunming recently, this "torch of anti-aggression" has been firmly raised in the high sky of Kunming, like a star that shines forever, unafraid of wind or rain.

At around 5 o'clock, the crowd of more than a thousand people left the venue. Everyone had the same feeling: "To uphold true peace, we must rise up and overthrow this human- ××××× ×!"

### Japanese Yen Repeatedly in Dire Straits, Counterfeit Money Unattended

[Reuters, Shanghai, 22nd Dispatch] The Japanese yen reported another drastic fall in the unofficial market today. One hundred national currency can be exchanged for 107 Japanese yen. Therefore, the Japanese yen is only worth eight pence, which is even more different from its official price of one shilling and two pence in Tokyo. Although rumors are rampant, financial circles believe that this drastic fall in the Japanese yen is of little significance.

[Reuters, Shanghai, 22nd Dispatch] The Japanese yen continues to fall, with each yen worth 93% of a national currency. The various gold and silver exchange offices in the occupied areas have recently decided on the "black market exchange rate" for counterfeit Huaxing Bank currency, that is, one yuan and six jiao is worth one national currency.

### Conflicts Between Mongolia and Puppet Regime Become Increasingly Tense, Report from Changchun

[Reuters, Changchun, 22nd Dispatch] According to local official reports, a Mongolian aircraft crossed the "Manchukuo" border on the 20th of this month and was shot down by "State of Zhou" machine gunners. It is said that the incident occurred near Lake Baikal. All the people in the aircraft died, but the number of people has not been disclosed. The aircraft was one of a fleet of bombers that crossed "Manchukuo." It is reported that conflicts on the Manchu-Mongolian border are becoming increasingly tense. Prior to this incursion by Mongolian aircraft, there was another conflict in which Mongolian troops crossed the × La River to the east of Lake Bano on the 15th of this month and began building fortresses on "Manchukuo" territory.

### Anti-Aggression League's Branch in Our Country's Academy, Generalissimo Chiang's Instructions, Containing Aggression Requires Resistance, Deeply Hope for United Action from All Countries

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] The China Branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement League held its second annual conference in Chongqing on the 21st. Hundreds of people attended, including representatives of various branches, members, representatives of party and government agencies, and guests from various groups. The atmosphere was warm and tense. First, Shao Lizi, the chairman of the presidium of the conference, reported in detail on the development of the International Anti-Aggression Movement over the past year and the great contribution of our country's heroic resistance to the Anti-Aggression Movement. Then, Chairman Lin's and Generalissimo Chiang's instructions and the congratulatory telegram from Li Shizeng, the chairman of the standing representative delegation of the League abroad, were read. Generalissimo Chiang's instructions stated:

The purpose of your League is to fight against the tide of aggression, to eliminate the threat and trend of war, and to lay the foundation for true world peace. However, to fight against the tide of aggression, we must not achieve results with gentle weakness and disorganized responses. We must base ourselves on the brave and resolute will of anti-aggressors around the world and use our greatest determination for peace to make active struggles in order to achieve results. All our compatriots across the country believe that our resistance is a concrete and effective action to contain aggression. All peace-loving countries recognize that the success of our country's resistance is the most effective warning to others who attempt to undermine world peace. If we unite to contain Japan's violent ambitions, then the work of defeating aggressors and avoiding the world's re-involvement in war will be completed sooner. Our resistance is not only for ourselves, but also for the world. The enthusiasm and heroism we have shown in the resistance is enough to encourage anti-aggressors around the world to ××× with us, inflict fatal blows on aggressors, and realize the goal of world peace.

After the reading, representatives of various agencies gave speeches in succession. Then, proposals and the conference declaration were discussed, and Ding Weifen, Zi Zuoren, and other 101 people were elected as honorary chairmen of the second session. Song Qingling was elected as chairman of the honorary presidium, and Song Ziwen and Shao Lizi were elected as chairman and vice-chairman of the second session. Finally, the conference ×× sent a telegram requesting the General Assembly to intensify its work to aid China and sanction Japan, and urging the League of Nations to implement sanctions against Japan.

### Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Continue: Military Alliance to Be Formed; British Cabinet to Decide Tomorrow; France and Turkey Will Join

[Associated Press, London, 21st] It has now been officially confirmed that Britain has agreed to form a defensive military alliance with the Soviet Union. The deadlock that has hampered the progress of the European peace front for two months has been broken. France will be one of the allied nations, and Turkey will also join. After making this decision, Britain will allow the Soviet Union to join the alliance under the following conditions: (1) An Anglo-French-Soviet treaty shall be established based on complete reciprocity, whereby if any of the three countries is attacked, the other two countries shall immediately provide assistance. (2) The three countries shall no longer declare guarantees to other countries, but agree that if any other country resists aggression with all its might and requests assistance, the three countries shall immediately provide full assistance with all their strength.

[Reuters, Geneva, 22nd] Halifax met with Maisky twice yesterday. Bonnet also separately visited Halifax and Maisky this morning. All newspaper diplomatic correspondents agree that there has been progress in the Anglo-Soviet talks, but as of now, no definitive decision has been made. Some newspapers say that nothing will be announced until the British Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. It is said that Bonnet has offered a compromise proposal including key points from both Britain and the Soviet Union. Under the current circumstances, the Baltic states may not be guaranteed.

[Reuters, Geneva, 21st] British Foreign Secretary Halifax held a three-hour talk with French Prime Minister Daladier and French Foreign Minister Bonnet in Paris last night. This morning, he met with the Soviet Russian Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, here. The two had an hour and a half talk, which was very sincere. It is known that Maisky came to Geneva yesterday afternoon, and when passing through Paris, he paid a visit to French Prime Minister Daladier. British Foreign Secretary Halifax is also meeting here with the League of Nations High Commissioner for Danzig, Burckhardt, and had tea with the League of Nations Secretary-General, Avenol. He plans to meet with Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler tonight. After Halifax and Maisky met, they each reported to their respective governments. There will probably be no further developments at this time, and we must wait until the British Cabinet meeting on the 24th, as Halifax will return to London on the 23rd to attend the Cabinet meeting. All parties are paying extremely careful attention to the current situation. Apart from a generally improved atmosphere, all other information must be carefully studied.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 22nd] This morning, London newspapers still made the most optimistic criticisms of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations currently underway in Geneva. The "Daily Telegraph" stated that it is almost bizarre that an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union has not yet been reached. However, the final decision may have to be made at the Cabinet meeting held on Wednesday, after Halifax rushes back to attend. Furthermore, the "Daily Express," which has always opposed an Anglo-Soviet agreement, published an article today stating, "Unfortunately, since Britain promised to guarantee the security of Central Europe, the conclusion of an Anglo-Soviet agreement is a natural result."

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] French Foreign Minister Bonnet said in a speech in Arras today that France's desire for peace has never changed. "The suffering from the absence of peace is enough to diminish human dignity and happiness. We believe that force cannot rule Europe." Bonnet emphasized that other countries are gradually agreeing with France's viewpoint, and said, "France has agreed with Britain to complete the guarantee system, and is negotiating with the Soviet Union and Turkey to seek peace. We hope to achieve satisfactory results soon."

### "Yankee Clipper" Crosses the Atlantic

[Reuters, Lisbon, 21st] The American Airlines' Yankee Clipper, which took off from Washington port for a transatlantic flight, arrived here tonight, taking 26 and a half hours. The crew consists of fourteen people and carries 100,000 letters, but no passengers, because the American civil aviation authorities stipulate that the company must carry passengers after five test flights.

### Serious Situation in Danzig: Nazi Party Rampant, One Person Killed; Poland Considers Attack on Customs a Provocative Act; Mutual Protests Demand Compensation and Guarantees

[Reuters, Warsaw, 21st] Polish Becker customs officers were attacked by Nazi stormtroopers yesterday and resisted behind closed doors. The Polish Commissioner in Danzig has lodged a strong protest with the Senate. These customs officers were rescued by Danzig police today.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 21st] It is reported that at 5 pm today, Nazi stormtroopers attacked the Polish Customs in Becker. According to the latest reports, the Polish customs supervisors resisted behind closed doors and requested assistance by telephone. It is heard that these stormtroopers had gathered in Danzig before the event. The Polish administrator has notified the Danzig Senate tonight, saying that the Polish government demands that the Senate immediately take necessary measures to restore the freedom of Polish officials in Becker. Polish sources say that today's German attack on the Polish Customs at Kassow, on the border of East Prussia, is a provocative act. However, it has not yet been determined whether the initiator was the Danzig Senate, the local Nazi Party, or Germany. It is reported that the five Nazi members who attacked the vehicle of the Polish Deputy Administrator came from Marienburg in East Prussia. According to a telegram from Berlin, Danzig Nazi leader Greiser has submitted a memorandum to the Polish Minister, demanding compensation for the Kassow incident, saying that when the Danzig Deputy Administrator sent by the Polish government to investigate arrived at the scene, the anti-Polish demonstrations had already stopped, and the innocent Danzig citizen Grubele was hit and killed by the headlights of the Deputy Administrator's car when he returned from Marienburg and exited the gate.

[Central News Agency, Warsaw, 21st] Regarding the anti-Polish incident that occurred in Kassow, Danzig, the Polish High Commissioner in Danzig, Chodacki, recently protested to the Chairman of the City Council, Greiser, stating that the municipal authorities had recently provided guarantees that they would take necessary measures to ensure the safety of Polish personnel so that they could freely perform their duties. However, this guarantee has not been fulfilled, indicating that the city authorities are unwilling or unable to maintain order, and should be held responsible for the Kassow incident. In short, the rights that Poland retains in Danzig in terms of taxation cannot be restricted by fait accompli. Therefore, three demands are made: (1) The municipal authorities should investigate the circumstances of the Kassow incident, obtain results, and notify Poland. (2) Polish customs officers should be compensated for damages. (3) Since Polish citizens and civil servants are frequently attacked, the municipal authorities should clearly and resolutely state to the Polish government whether they can maintain order and protect the safety of Polish personnel.

German Sources

[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 22nd] A citizen of Danzig, named Gdny Buler, was shot and killed by a Polish coachman for no reason on the 20th. According to the official statement issued by the Danzig municipal authorities, Buler hired a cab that evening to go to Danzig. Suddenly, a car with Polish license plate number VI-61.306 violated the road traffic rules and shone extremely bright headlights on it. Grubele was forced to stop the car, and the coachman, Hopo, got out of the car to inquire. Unexpectedly, the people in the car with the Polish license plate started shooting without saying a word. His head and chest were injured. Then, the coachman Pu and two other passengers went to the German-Polish border, Bert Hoff, and brought back the local police with medicine to the scene of the incident, only to learn that a car head that drove out of the Polish border Baosichao station has brought the killers away.

As for the tax decision on the Polish vehicle, it has been temporarily postponed. According to official confirmation, one was Pankowski, the secretary of the Polish Legation, one was Dr. Schuler (both are Polish diplomatic representatives stationed in Danzig), one was Wei Tai, the chief inspector of the customs, and one was a coachman whose true name has not yet been verified. After this incident occurred, Greiser, the Speaker of the Danzig Senate, immediately invited the Polish Minister to Danzig, Chodacki, to come and protested in the name of the Free City of Danzig. The protest "opposed in the strongest terms the perverse acts of Polish officials who enjoy extraterritoriality within the territory of Danzig, and demanded that Poland immediately investigate the truth of the case and implement compensation."

[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 22nd] According to the official announcement released yesterday afternoon, Grubele, who was tragically murdered on the evening of the 22nd, was shot in the back. In the Polish "murder" car that caused the incident, two Polish military pistols and one Mauser pistol were found. According to police investigation, one of the aforementioned military pistols had been recently fired. It is also particularly noteworthy that after the incident, a locomotive carried the murderers to the Baosichao station in Poland, and the driver was a Polish employee of the Kassow station in Danzig.

Polish Statement

[Haitong News Agency, Danzig, 26th] Yesterday afternoon, the Polish side issued an article to defend the Kassow incident. The article mentions the shooting incident on the evening of the 20th, saying, "On Saturday, a Polish customs officer in Kassow was suddenly attacked by a crowd and retreated into Polish territory. The Polish diplomatic representative stationed in Danzig planned to send two officials to Kassow to request protection from the local police, but was refused. The two then went to Bu Suofu alone and were threatened by the crowd. For self-defense, the coachman fired a shot into the sky as a warning, but it was still ineffective. The crowd was fired upon once more. As for how it started and what the results were, Warsaw of the Polish army has not yet learned of it. The Polish government has lodged a serious protest with Danzig."

### Soviet Union Will Fulfill Its Obligations in Future Wars: Destroy Aggressors With Strong Force

[Reuters, Moscow, 21st] A book about future wars has recently been published here for the public to read. It states that if a fascist invasion occurs, the Soviet Union should be loyal to its obligations and never abandon democratic countries. The book describes a hypothetical war in which Germany attacks France and Soviet Russia. The "Pravda" newspaper gave a three-column review of it, calling it "the most realistic and reasonable" work. The book describes the Soviet Russian Air Force rejecting the German Air Force's attack and flying to bomb the bases of the German Air Force, destroying the German Air Force. As a result of the defeat, a revolution occurred in Germany, and France was reorganized into a People's Front government.

### Canada Participates in the War: Memorial Tower Unveiled; British King Attends and Delivers a Speech: Peace and Freedom are Inseparable

[Reuters, Ottawa, 21st] This morning, a ceremony was held here to unveil the memorial tower for participation in the war. The British King delivered a speech, with the famous line: "There is no lasting peace without freedom, and no lasting freedom without peace." The British King said that we should pay attention to the symbolic meaning of the memorial tower: "The archway through which the national army passed is engraved with images of peace and freedom. This is not a mere juxtaposition, because peace and freedom are inseparable. It is a great event that one of the world's major capitals (referring to Ottawa) has this memorial tower to commemorate the great truth." The British King also said, "The memorial tower reminds me of Canada's contributions in the last Great War. Fortunately, my work has been largely completed. The exquisite artwork I unveiled (referring to the memorial tower) will surely vividly express the spirit of Canada forever. This memorial tower is enough to show the world the heart of Canada and is the best symbol, which is appropriately called 'Response.' When world peace was disrupted and human freedom was endangered in the last World War, the world expected Canada's answer, and Canada sacrificed 60,000 lives for this, and the number of those who were injured in their hearts was even greater. This memorial tower is indeed a good word to future times and all countries in the world." When the British King spoke, his words were clear, and a large crowd made statements at the memorial. The British King arrived at 11 am, and the crowd cheered incessantly. A guard of honor, dressed neatly, surrounded the memorial tower, holding military flags fourteen feet high, which was very spectacular. The crowd sang hymns, and then the British King and Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie presented wreaths and placed them next to the memorial tower. The British King walked around at will for about half an hour, and the couple were wildly cheered by the crowd before leaving. The memorial tower is built of granite and is worth 200,000 pounds. The location is excellent, facing the newly expanded Elgin Street, with the beautiful Laurentian Mountains as the background. A total of 200,000 people participated in this memorial tower event. The British King and his wife contacted Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret Rose by long-distance telephone this morning, and left here for Kingston at 6:36 pm (Greenwich Mean Time).

### German-Italian Military Alliance Signed Yesterday Morning; Permanent Committee Organized Simultaneously; Wartime Economic Cooperation to Be Carried Out

[Reuters, Berlin, 22nd] The German-Italian military alliance was formally signed here this morning by Ribbentrop and Ciano. The alliance treaty stipulates three points: (1) Both parties need to maintain mutual contact forever in order to obtain common opinions on disputes concerning the interests of both parties and the European situation. (2) If the common interests of one party are jeopardized due to international developments, both parties must immediately conduct consultations to decide on steps to be taken to protect the interests of both parties. (3) If the security and major interests of one party are threatened, the other party should do its best to provide assistance politically and diplomatically. If one party is at war or in dispute with Germany, the other party should provide assistance with all its naval, land, and air forces. The annex to the agreement stipulates that Germany and Italy will further expand cooperation between the two countries in military activities and wartime economy. The two countries will organize a permanent committee to receive instructions from the two foreign ministers to determine the provisions of Articles 1 and 2 of the agreement. Once a war occurs, both parties must fully agree before peace can be negotiated. The relations of the friendly countries of the two alliances, such as Japan, "Manchukuo," and Hungary, are highly valued. The term of this treaty is ten years.

[Reuters, Berlin, 21st] Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived in Berlin today. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop personally went to the station. Italian Ambassador to Germany, Attolico, German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, and military and political dignitaries also arrived at the station to welcome him. The signing of the agreement will take place tomorrow at 11 am in the Ambassador's Office of the New Reich Chancellery. It is expected that Hitler will not participate for a while, but Ribbentrop will guide Ciano to meet Hitler in his personal office after the signing. At that time, Ciano will hand over a personal letter from Mussolini to Hitler. The German and Italian foreign ministers will make short speeches after the agreement is signed, which will be broadcast by radio stations in both countries.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st] Hitler received Italian Foreign Minister Ciano this afternoon and held talks. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. A press release was issued afterwards, only saying that the talks lasted a long time, and nothing else was mentioned. In addition, Hitler also received Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys and held discussions. Ribbentrop and Lithuanian Ambassador to Germany, Škirpa, were also present.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 21st] The Foreign Ministry spokesman met with journalists today and remained silent on the inquiry regarding the "basic decision" of the Cabinet to decide whether Japan would participate in the German-Italian military alliance. He could not make any statement. The spokesman also refused to answer whether the Japanese government had notified any other governments of its "fixed policy," only saying that the Japanese government is closely watching the situation in Europe. General observers believe that Japan is currently unwilling to participate in the German-Italian military alliance, but agrees to amend the Anti-Comintern Pact to express Japan's sympathy for the policies of Germany and Italy.

### Status of Danzig: League of Nations Three-Nation Committee Decides Not to Change

[Associated Press, Geneva, 21st] The League of Nations' tripartite committee of Britain, France and Sweden has decided that under the current tense situation, the status of Danzig will not be changed and will remain under the protection of the League of Nations. Therefore, in theory, the League of Nations is still the protector of Danzig. However, the High Commissioner for Danzig has not returned to his post since reporting to the League of Nations in February.

Small Commentary

### Promoting the Anti-Aggression Movement

The International Anti-Aggression Movement Conference Branch met on the 21st. Chairman Chiang's speech aimed to promote the international anti-aggression movement and expand the international movement to aid China and sanction Japan.

Here, we must especially recognize that the current international situation is very conducive to our promotion of this anti-aggression movement. The second is because democratic countries all over the world and the vast majority of people who love democracy and peace have deeply felt the threat of fascist aggressors; the second is because of the success of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy diplomacy and anti-aggression movement, and the progress of the movement for Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States to establish an anti-aggression front; the third is China's struggle to resist Japan and save the country, which has been bravely supported for more than twenty-two months, and is becoming more and more enthusiastic. It is recognized by the world as the main force of anti-aggression, and at the same time it shows the world: the fascist aggressors who have been rampant for a lifetime can be defeated!

Under this favorable situation, we must follow Chairman Chiang's guidance, step up national diplomatic activities, launch a domestic and overseas Chinese public opinion mobilization and other propaganda mobilizations, and promote the international anti-aggression movement. In particular, we must strive to publicize the disasters caused by Japan × in China to Chinese civilians, to world peace, and to human culture, strive to publicize the unity and heroic resistance of all ethnic groups and parties in China and even all the people, and strive to publicize that unifying and developing the international anti-aggression movement and aiding China and sanctioning Japan is the common task of today's world justice and peace people. At the same time, in order to achieve these tasks, we must also redouble our efforts to clean up all remarks and actions that oppose the war and build the country, and clean up all remarks and actions that undermine unity, resistance to war, and the international anti-aggression front.

### First Sound of Municipal Improvement

In order to make Hong Kong an important city in the world, the local authorities have recently planned to improve it. Today's newspaper reported that the first step will be to demarcate industrial zones in Hong Kong and Kowloon, that is, factories originally located in commercial or residential areas will be ordered to move to areas such as King's Road, Cheung Sha Wan Road, or Ma Tau Wai Road starting from January 1 of next year.

This plan is not only the first sound of municipal improvement, but also can be said to be one of the benevolent policies to improve social security and protect people's lives at this time of increasing population and flourishing industry. However, when advising relocation, we should also pay attention to two points: First, to minimize the difficulties of industrial operators as much as possible, and to provide considerable and necessary convenience and protection when they withdraw from the old site and move to the new site. Second, for designated industrial areas, any factory should be differentiated according to its nature in order to ensure the safety and convenience between them. At the same time, each factory or factory unit should have considerable and necessary sanitary equipment, air defense equipment, sports equipment, and even cultural equipment to promote the morality and knowledge of workers. This is not only to protect the reasonable life of workers, but also to protect social tranquility and protect the lives of citizens.

### A Meeting With the Deposed German Emperor, Continued Conclusion

— J. V Kurenberg Wang Zhong'e

What made the visit very surprising was the German Emperor's alertness and strength. His face was extremely moving. When he spoke of the many books that recorded the German Emperor, only a few authors could understand him. There was a trace of mockery on his face, and his tone was satirical.

Talking is energetic and eloquent, and it is impossible to stop him. The reporter wanted to switch to another topic in a meeting - my chance came just right, the German Emperor was eating jam and bread himself - but he smiled at me and continued to talk! He never forgets a date or a name.

Their conversations are frank and sometimes mixed with slang, but they only talk about their own era, and never about things after November 1918.

These are his living conditions, which are very upright, and he never thinks about speculation or conspiracy rebellion. Gentle in character, with the joy of old age. He can often be seen being interfered with, and there is an old and solid look in his eyes, examining himself and maintaining a peaceful temper.

He spoke with warm love about the people who were loyal and sympathetic to his exile life, as well as his friends. Speaking of England, he was very happy. The German Emperor felt that he was half English. He loves the life of British relatives and imitates them with his own retirement. But he feels that there is often a feeling of resistance in his heart.

The German Emperor gets up every morning between 8:00 and 9:00. After breakfast, he walks in the garden for a while. When walking in the village, he first informs the police, so they follow him very carefully. In fact, there is no need for special protection. He is very popular with the villagers.

Logging is a thing of the past. He now likes gardening and taking care of roses. He often drives out to the countryside or goes to the North Coast to see friends and drink tea. And he often receives a lot of mail.

Therefore, after lunch, he goes to the study to end the day's work. He often invites the "work community" of Doorn: his friends archaeologists. After buying Corfn Island in 1903, antiquities became a beloved hobby. In twenty years of exile, he has completed his "events," and antiquities have indeed become his greatest love. He feels that it is very pleasant to be with scientists, and he only invites scientists.

These are the impressions of an exiled monarch. In short, he has the joyful tendencies of old age, a great interest in discussing ancient culture, and many thriving flowers in his simple Doorn residence.

### Can Europe Avoid the Scourge of War? Views of Foreign Residents in Shanghai

[Shanghai Correspondence] The majority of foreign residents in this port do not believe that a major European war is imminent. At least one French person believes that war is inevitable sooner or later, and one Italian person believes that the likelihood of war is greater than the likelihood of it not happening. However, one German person believes that all issues can ultimately find a peaceful resolution. Those few who do not believe that war is coming generally believe that hope may be the mother of thought. But the American community is certain that the United States will not participate in the war. As the European crisis becomes increasingly urgent, this reporter has sought the opinions of residents of several countries most closely related to the European situation and compiled them below. I believe this will be welcomed by those concerned about the current situation.

Germany Wishes to Live in Peace with France

Dr. William, a German lawyer, said, "I do not believe that war is imminent. Germany has a leader who is committed to peace and will not resort to force. I recently traveled to Europe and found that only Germany does not discuss war. People in other countries say that Germany does not trust the opinions expressed in the newspapers of various countries. Such statements are extremely ignorant. You should know that Germany is not like that. Germany has always wanted to live in peace with its neighbors. Leader Hitler recently made a special statement that Germany wants to live in peace with France. Germany is not shaken by the British newspapers' constant talk of war. Germany does not want any British territory. I think the Polish issue has the possibility of a peaceful resolution. I believe that Poland and other countries can understand that it is unreasonable for Germany to be separated by a corridor belonging to another country without providing Germany with convenient transportation. In a recent speech, the Leader stated that the National Socialist Party Congress in September of this year would be called the 'Peace Congress.' This point is worthy of attention."

The Situation in Italy Is Different Now Than Before

Mr. Richini, an Italian from the Sino-Italian Shipping Company, said, "There are two opportunities to prevent a European war: (1) the so-called democratic front and the Axis powers can reconcile; (2) the democratic front is powerful enough to intimidate Berlin and Rome. However, the latter is unlikely to succeed. Germany and Italy will fight for their rights. Italy has not forgotten what it was given by Britain and France after the last European war when negotiating peace. Britain and France took everything, while Italy got nothing. A hungry man will not be picky about food and must get it urgently. One thing is certain now: Germany and Italy will never be satisfied with what they have now. The Italian people are now being indoctrinated daily to believe that Italy's national power is strong. The authorities pay little attention to the lack of parties and money, nor do they pay attention to the fact that in the new era of war, economics is more important than weapons. The current situation is certainly far worse than in 1935 when the British fleet entered the Mediterranean to confront the Italian fleet. The Italian fleet's ammunition was only enough for six hours of combat. Now, Italy's army and navy are fully stocked with ammunition."

Japanese Impressions Focus on Britain

Mr. Sbibata, a reporter for the Domei News Agency, said, "I think there is a 50/50 chance of a European war happening or not. Britain has many concerns about war. One is that if a European war breaks out, Japan will take the opportunity to seize British interests in the Far East. Secondly, Britain wants to maintain the balance of power and the current situation, and wants to determine what the results of the German, Italian, and Japanese anti-Comintern pact will be in order to speak out, so at least for now, it will not launch an attack. In short, Britain is currently adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Most of its attention is undoubtedly focused on the possibility of Britain acting as a mediator to achieve peace between China and Japan, as this move would place Japan in an unfavorable position to participate in the European war on a large scale. Britain believes that in this way, it can proceed to build a democratic front. The overall situation is subtle and who dares to decide whether a European war will happen or not? Any event can affect the balance of power."

French Businessman Observes that War Is Inevitable

The import manager of a certain trading house in Paris said, "In my view, a European war is inevitable. It may happen in the near future, or it may happen some time from now, or it may even happen tomorrow, but I am sure it will eventually happen. I think all negotiations will not only fail to cure the disease but will also worsen it. The only hope lies in the democratic front being stronger than the Berlin-Rome Axis, but even so, it may not be able to eliminate the scourge of war. A letter from my Paris headquarters said that although war may not happen immediately, precautions must be taken. Therefore, orders for goods sold to China that require immediate delivery can still be accepted by France, while orders for delivery in the distant future must be rejected to prevent war, port blockades, or ships being sunk and goods being confiscated. Since the summer of 1914, Europe has never been more worried about the scourge of war than it is today. When the Czech crisis occurred last September, my trading house still accepted long-term orders, taking risks, but today it does not dare to. This has greatly damaged businesses that ship goods from Europe to Shanghai for sale. Since Chinese factories have been destroyed by artillery fire, sales of imported textiles have increased sharply. It would be great if we could accept long-term orders."

Democratic Countries Can Eliminate European War

A British stockbroker who recently traveled to Europe and returned to Shanghai said, "I think the sudden strengthening of the attitude of the democratic countries can largely eliminate the European war. Today, gunpowder is scattered all over Europe, and a single spark can easily start a prairie fire. But I think Hitler and Mussolini now both need security matches and intend to continue to take this precaution. They would rather engage in negotiations than risk failure, which would result in the loss of everything they have today. I think that since Germany has signed an agreement with Romania, it can obtain the benefits it would have obtained by recovering its old colonies, such as oil and wheat, which can be obtained at will without having to pay transportation costs and maintain maritime navigation. The tension in Europe cannot be eased for a while, but I believe that war will not happen."

Italian Wisdom Will Not Seek War

Mr. Ross, the Secretary of the YMCA of the American Navy, said, "In my personal opinion, there will be no war in Europe. European politicians today all know the meaning of war, especially Mussolini. Mr. Mussolini is extremely intelligent and patriotic and will never allow Italy to be destroyed. I served in the Italian YMCA for a long time during the last European war and gained a lot of experience. I know Mr. Mussolini very well, but I know very little about Hitler. However, I think Hitler would be powerless without Mussolini's help. Mussolini makes good use of his wisdom and is admired even by his enemies. I believe that Mussolini must know that if a major war breaks out, he will lose his power and destroy his achievements. Italy's financial resources cannot engage in a major war. Italy may be forced to be drawn into the whirlpool of war, like Austria in the last European war, but I personally do not believe that Italy will do this. I believe that Mussolini, because of his familiarity with economics and his love for his country, will never sign a declaration of war against Britain and France. He will find another way out, just like he did in Munich."

### First Sound of Municipal Government Improvement: Hong Kong Government Designates Industrial Zones in Hong Kong and Kowloon; Locations are King's Road, Cheung Sha Wan Road, or Ma Tau Kok; All Factories in Other Areas Must Relocate Starting Next Year

Recently, the number of residents in Hong Kong has increased sharply, and industrial plants in the mainland have also relocated to Hong Kong to survive, so the population density in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon has increased suddenly, leaving almost no vacant land. However, Hong Kong is a commercial port, and mixing factories in between not only tarnishes the city's appearance but also has a significant impact on the health and well-being of residents. Therefore, the Hong Kong authorities have drafted the 1939 Urban Design Ordinance and appointed multiple committee members and experts to manage the affairs of the Urban Design Improvement Committee. Once the ordinance is implemented, the first step will be to designate each district in the city as a residential area, an industrial area, or a commercial area. Currently, the industrial areas have been designated as King's Road on Hong Kong Island and Cheung Sha Wan Road or Ma Tau Kok in Kowloon. These areas have fewer residential buildings, and some factories have already been established there. The current priority of the government authorities is to relocate all factories mixed in with commercial or residential areas to avoid affecting the health and well-being of residents. It is understood that the authorities have decided to implement the above plan, starting from January 1, 1940. All factories originally established in residential or commercial areas must relocate in accordance with the order starting from January 1 next year and must not delay. Those who violate the order will be ordered to suspend operations. Currently, factories are paying close attention to this and have already sent people to survey the above locations to avoid being caught off guard when the time comes.

### Water Storage in Hong Kong and Kowloon Breaks Records; Water Released All Day Starting Today; Water Storage in Reservoirs Reaches 4.5 Billion Gallons; Silver Jubilee Reservoir Water Transported to Hong Kong Now Has New Pipes

This year's rainfall in April broke the previous record for the same period. The Water Department immediately extended the daily drinking water supply time from eight hours to ten hours. In the past three days, continuous heavy rain has further increased the water storage in the reservoirs of Hong Kong and Kowloon. Therefore, the Water Department officially announced yesterday afternoon that it had decided to resume the full-day supply of drinking water from today onwards, without any restrictions. The reporter received semi-official news the day before yesterday and published that the Water Department planned to implement the full-day water supply on Monday of last week. However, the implementation of a law requires certain procedures to be followed, so it was delayed until today. As for whether this full-day water supply method will change this year, it is still unknown and depends on whether the rainfall is sufficient in the next three months of the rainy season.

Water Storage in Hong Kong and Kowloon Reservoirs Increases Sharply

In the past three days, the amount of water obtained by the reservoirs in Hong Kong and Kowloon totaled 998,000,000 gallons. As of 6 a.m. yesterday, the amount of water increased in the reservoirs on Hong Kong Island within 72 hours ranged from 7.84 inches to 10 inches, and the amount of water increased in the reservoirs in Kowloon ranged from 9.1 inches to 13.1 inches. On May 12, the amount of water stored in the reservoirs on Hong Kong Island was 1,866,000,000 gallons, which increased to 2,296,000,000 gallons as of yesterday morning, an increase of 426,000,000 gallons. On May 12, the amount of water stored in the reservoirs in Kowloon was 1,657,000,000 gallons, which has now increased to 2,229,000,000 gallons, an increase of 572,000,000 gallons. Currently, the total amount of drinking water stored in the reservoirs of Hong Kong and Kowloon is 4,521,000,000 gallons, which is the highest record of water storage in the history of Hong Kong. This is due to the Silver Jubilee Reservoir's ability to store a large amount of drinking water. Before the reservoir was completed, the maximum amount of drinking water that could be stored in the reservoirs of Hong Kong and Kowloon was only 3,000,000,000 gallons.

Highest Water Storage Record in More Than Ten Years

In the past three days, a total of 11 inches of water has been obtained, and the amount of water obtained in May has reached 16.85 inches, the highest record since 1928. The amount of water obtained in May of that year was 18.41 inches. The highest record of water obtained in May was 25.445 inches in 1927. There is a great possibility that this year's May water record will break the highest record. The amount of water obtained this month is already about 5 inches higher than the average. Since January, a total of 25.445 inches of water has been obtained, about 15 inches higher than the average. The time with the most water obtained in the past three days was yesterday (22nd) morning, from 5:30 a.m. to 6:30 a.m., with a total of 2.74 inches of water. From 10 a.m. on Friday to 10 a.m. on Saturday, 2.75 inches of water was obtained. From 10 a.m. on Saturday to 10 a.m. on Sunday, a total of 2.965 inches of water was obtained. From 10 a.m. on Sunday to 10 a.m. yesterday (Monday), a total of 5.76 inches of water was obtained. In three days, a total of 11.5 inches of water was obtained, which is equal to the average amount of water in May. The pipes used to transport water from the Silver Jubilee Reservoir to Hong Kong have now been replaced with new pipes. The pipes are capable of transporting a large amount of drinking water and are placed on the seabed between Hong Kong and Kowloon. They will be completed soon. When they are put into use in the future, the water supply in Hong Kong will be temporarily suspended within a certain period of time each day. The Water Department will announce the date in a few days so that residents can be prepared.

### Betrand Speaks on the Latest International Situation at a Welcome Meeting in the Cultural Community

— Qi Zhuo

Democratic countries are uniting in development, and we must do our best to promote it!

The universe after the rain is clear and bright. Running outside from the depressing small room was originally the intention, not to mention this is a rare gathering—not only can you meet friends, but you can also listen to the speech of an international friend who has come from thousands of miles away. So, on Conduit Road and Bonham Road, there were many cultural figures from Hong Kong.

Mr. Betrand, a famous reporter for the Manchester Guardian in the United Kingdom, was assigned to come to China via Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Branch of the Chinese Youth Journalists Association and the Hong Kong Liaison Office of the Literary and Art Association held a meeting to welcome him at the St. John's Hall on Bonham Road at 4 p.m. yesterday and invited Mr. Betrand to speak on "The Latest International Situation." Mr. Betrand is a famous British reporter who expresses great sympathy for China's war of resistance. He personally inspected the front lines of Shanxi last winter and wrote books such as "The Front Line of North China" and "The New Life of China." More than 100 people from the cultural community in Hong Kong attended the meeting yesterday. It was really a full house. After Mr. Xu Dihans speech of welcome, the young and amiable Mr. Betrand began his lively speech, which was translated by Mr. Luo Yinpu.

Mr. Betrand said that in the year since he left Hong Kong, he spent half a year in London and half a year in New York. He was very happy to see the progressive China in the midst of the struggle again and to see all his dear friends. Before he began to talk about the main topic, he first explained his position: he did not represent any country or any government, but was a true friend of the Chinese people. He said that in Europe and the United States, the opinions of the general public on this issue are largely the same, so what he is saying now represents the words of most foreigners. Then, he turned to the main topic in a very organized manner:

There are two possible policies in the international arena: the first is "collective security"; the second is "the balance of power." The United Kingdom, the United States, and France often vacillate between the two. The collective security system was once highly praised, but it was finally destroyed by Japan in 1931. The serious problems that followed, such as the Abyssinian problem, the Spanish problem, the Czech problem, and other tragedies, were tantamount to giving a serious blow to "collective security."

The opposite of collective security is Chamberlainism - realism. This is what caused it. Under the rule of the Conservative Party oligarchy, Chamberlains fundamental attempt was to compromise with Germany and Italy, and then win over France to form a four-power alliance of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy, so as to squeeze out the Soviet Union.

Why do the British people oppose Chamberlain, but Chamberlain's regime has continued to this day? This should be studied from the relationship between the United Kingdom and France. Originally, the United Kingdom and France had counteracting forces that were mutually restraining each other. At the most tense time of the Czech problem, Germany occupied the Sudetenland, but he wanted him to do it slowly and quietly, without publicizing it. Hitler was unwilling to wait and publicized it in a hurry.

Today, the newspaper reported that the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union will form a new agreement. If this is true, there will be two possibilities: one is that Chamberlain's regime will continue; the United States may also be able to join the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union to re-implement "collective security." Although this is considered too late, it can still be salvaged. If this situation continues to develop, it will undoubtedly increase the power of democratic countries to help China, deepen Japan's difficulties, and the final victory of China's war of resistance can be brought forward by two years or one year.

The recent unanimous action of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France on the Gulangyu incident is also a symbol of this trend. Chamberlains transformation. In addition to hoping that the government will unite, China must also unite the people and expand the anti-aggression movement.

—A burst of warm applause thanked the international friend for his instructions.

If you have any questions, you can raise them for discussion, —Mr. Xu Dihans hope to liven up the atmosphere of the meeting. Mr. Qiao Mu immediately stood up;

" is not easy to achieve," Mr. Betrand said, "The situation is different now than before." "If the development of the new situation is successful, will Japan join the German-Italian front?" Mr. Betrand said this to Mr. Si Mu: "Japan may have two possibilities: one is to dismantle the union of the United Kingdom and the United States, and the other is to attack the Soviet Union. Both of these are difficult and will fail."

### Rain for Days Causes Wall Collapse: Six People Narrowly Avoid Being Buried Alive; Swift Rescue Ensures Everyone Survives; Landslides Common Throughout the Peak District

Continuous torrential rains have eroded soil in various areas, leading to frequent landslide incidents. On the evening of the 21st, a tragic incident occurred in a small house in Chueng Lung Hong, Sai Wan Ho, Shau Kei Wan, where a landslide crushed the structure, resulting in three deaths and two injuries. Just hours after this tragedy, a wall collapse occurred on Kennedy Road, also due to rain erosion. The wall's collapse buried six people alive. Fortunately, rescuers arrived in time, saving their lives. It is reported that the small house opposite 140 Kennedy Road was home to two couples, Zhang De and his wife, Huang Bai and his wife, and another couple, Ling Mei and his wife, totaling six people. Around 7 a.m. yesterday, the wall behind the house collapsed due to days of heavy rain and erosion. The collapsed wall completely buried the house. Residents nearby called the fire department, which dispatched fire trucks and ambulances to the scene. Liu, a resident of 140 Kennedy Road, and his family, along with Dennis, an employee of Tienshan Trading Company, assisted firefighters in the excavation. Soon, all six people inside the house were rescued. Zhang De told reporters, "We were awakened from our sleep by a loud noise. The roof collapsed, and we were trapped inside. Soon, all light was blocked out, and the air was filled with the smell of earth. We could hear digging, and we thought a long time had passed. When we were dug out, we realized we had only been buried for fifteen minutes." Additionally, (1) a large amount of soil collapsed on a side path on Stubbs Road yesterday morning, covering half the path; (2) near Kennedy Road on MacDonnell Road; (3) at the junction of Robinson Road and Arbuthnot Road; (4) on the hillside of Wan Chai East Hospital Road; (5) near 295 Gough Hill Road; and (6) on the hillside of Wong Nai Chung Road, landslides occurred yesterday morning, blocking traffic. It is reported that police stations in various districts have received reports of landslides. To maintain traffic flow, they have notified the Public Works Department to dispatch engineering teams to quickly excavate and clear the soil. Although traffic in various areas was temporarily blocked, it has since been restored to normal after the swift cleanup.

House Collapse on Caine Road

Also, a house in Caine Road suddenly collapsed last night, injuring an Indian resident. The incident occurred at 2 Caine Road. At 11:30 p.m. last night, everyone was sound asleep when a sudden loud noise occurred. The second floor collapsed, and one Indian resident, who was sleeping there, was unable to escape in time and was trapped under the fallen debris. Residents on the first floor, hearing the noise, panicked and fled, unsure of what was happening. After discovering the collapse, they called the Central Police Station to report the incident. The police station dispatched a fire engine, an emergency response vehicle, and an ambulance, along with a large number of Chinese and British detectives, to investigate. The injured resident received minor surgery and was then allowed to leave. It is reported that the injured resident only suffered a minor injury to his right foot and did not require hospitalization. It is also reported that the second floor of the house was made of wooden planks, so the pressure from the collapse was minimal, and the Indian resident only suffered minor injuries. Otherwise, he would have been buried alive.

### Former Government Army Pilot Discusses the Future of the Spanish War: Franco's Deployments Are Shaken; Public Resistance Remains

Lawahari, a former member of the International Air Force of the Spanish government army, arrived in Hong Kong yesterday. In a conversation with reporters, he discussed the Spanish war and his observations, stating, "I firmly believe that the Spanish war is not over. After the German and Italian forces withdraw from Spanish territory, General Franco will face a crisis on all sides. Many of Franco's subordinates are wavering, and the spirit of the Spanish people remains unyielding. Although they are currently subjected to violence, they will eventually rise up, and this force will not be easily suppressed." Regarding the main reason for the Spanish government army's defeat, he said that the food supply lines were blocked by the enemy, leading to a lack of supplies. In terms of defensive fortifications, the defense lines of Madrid are exceptionally strong, comparable to the Maginot Line.

### Escaping a Seven-Month Ordeal; Guangxi Ship Returns to Hong Kong from Guangzhou; Numerous Difficulties and Setbacks Before Departure; Fate of Tung On and Tai Lee Ships Still Uncertain

The Tung On and other foreign ships on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong route, which had been detained in Guangzhou for seven months, were released after serious negotiations by the British Consul in Guangzhou. Recently, the Chinese side proposed conditions requiring all cargo on the ships to be completely unloaded before being allowed to leave. It is reported that the Guangxi ship returned to Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 20th. However, due to cargo issues, the other ships were unable to leave as scheduled. The details are as follows:

Departure from Guangzhou

After the Chinese side proposed the conditions, all ships prepared to unload their cargo. The Guangxi ship sailed to Dien Bridge on the 19th to unload its cargo. However, Jardine Matheson Warehouse refused to unload the cargo because the ship had not obtained a permit from the Chinese authorities. The ship then negotiated with the navy. Several Chinese warships, seeing the ship crossing the police line, inquired about the situation and sent Chinese soldiers to assist. The ship was then able to unload its cargo. On the 20th, it departed from Guangzhou and arrived in Hong Kong at around 5 p.m. This was the Guangxi ship's escape.

News of Other Ships

Regarding the Tung On, Tai Lee, and Tai Ming ships, according to sources, they were still detained at the mouth of the Pearl River yesterday. The Chinese side's condition for allowing the ships to leave empty required inspection. Cargo that could be carried back to Hong Kong would be allowed, while cargo that could not would have to be completely unloaded. Therefore, the ships were delayed and unable to leave as scheduled. It is estimated that they may be able to escape and return to Hong Kong in the next day or two.

### Kowloon Factories Decide to Build Their Own Power Lines: Repeated Requests to Reduce Electricity Rates Have Yielded No Results; Three or Four Major Factories Have Already Negotiated to Install Generators

Major factories in Kowloon believe that the electricity company's charges are too high. Several days ago, they jointly wrote to the company requesting a reduction in rates. At the time, the company seemed receptive to the idea, but so far, there has been no concrete response. Yesterday, the factories sent another letter requesting a reduction, but there was still no result. It is reported that there are no fewer than twenty factories of considerable scale in Kowloon, with the three or four largest factories paying up to 2,500 yuan per month for electricity. The factories believe that the price of each generator is only over 10,000 yuan, and they can recover the cost in a few months by installing their own generators. Therefore, they have decided to install their own generators and are currently consulting with a British company. However, smaller factories are facing difficulties.

### Provincial Party Department Formulates Guidelines for Mass Organization and Training Work; Issued to Party Departments in Various Regions to Follow the Same Standards

(Qujiang News) The Provincial Party Department believes that the people's power in the province has not been fully utilized during the Anti-Japanese War, and in order to meet military needs, it is now urgent to catch up and carry out various tasks of organizing the masses, training the masses, and leading the masses. All 30 million men, women, and children in Guangdong can be incorporated into the organization's framework, receive the benefits of doctrine, and participate in various departments' Anti-Japanese War and national construction work under the leadership of the Provincial Party Department. Therefore, it has formulated a general plan and implementation measures for mass organization and training work, which will be issued to Party Departments in various counties and cities so that they can follow the same standards for organization and training work and establish the foundation for the mass movement in the birthplace of the revolution. The first step of the plan is to adjust the original civil groups in various regions, improve their organization, and strengthen their work. The second step is to expand the organization of grassroots mass groups and establish various agricultural, industrial, commercial, and student groups at the county, district, and township levels, penetrating into rural areas and organizing the masses from the bottom up. The third step is to expand guidance to the masses, organize wartime work teams, and organize them according to the characteristics of the masses to undertake various wartime service tasks to meet military needs. The fourth step is to universally implement the training of Anti-Japanese War and national construction knowledge and skills, mobilize Party members and intellectuals in various regions, adopt various forms of activity, and conduct training separately. In addition, various social activities, such as assisting in the promotion of military service, relief for disaster victims and refugees, savings campaigns, national economic construction campaigns, and donation campaigns, all have detailed plans and are being promoted step by step. There are also strict plans for the organization and training of the masses in guerrilla areas. The plan will be completed in all parts of the province within a month.

### Shantou Naval Vessel Moved Elsewhere Due to Xiamen Incident; Municipal Government Handles Relief Work

[Shantou Express] After repeated air raids on Shantou City, the violent acts of the Japanese planes have recently stopped temporarily. Only one alarm was issued on the afternoon of the 19th, when a Japanese transport plane passed through the area to the west. According to intelligence from military agencies, the Japanese aircraft carrier in the Chao-Shan sea area has long since moved elsewhere, leaving only one destroyer and one large cruiser patrolling between Ma Yu and Da Hao. According to investigations, the Japanese naval vessel was dispatched to the Minnan Sea because of the Xiamen incident. The Shantou Municipal Government is now continuing to handle the aftermath of the bombed areas, providing relief to the dead and wounded, and taking in refugee children and sending them to Ning for resettlement.

### People in Various Counties in Southern Road Continue to Destroy Highways

[Suixi Express] Since the invasion of Hainan Island by the enemy, the situation in the Southern Road has become increasingly tense and has entered a state of war. Suixi, one district, is close to the coast, but most of its territory is adjacent to the French Guangzhou Bay, and the terrain is flat. Since the spring of this year, the first district has been instructed by the county government to destroy highways, and has already instructed the township chiefs and deputy chiefs under its jurisdiction to complete the destruction within the prescribed time limit and report it. However, the township chiefs all feel that the terrain is flat and the destruction is not thorough. Now, they have been ordered to thoroughly destroy all highways within the jurisdiction of the district, and the nine townships and towns near Anliang, Xi'an, Nanmu, Donghe, Zhonghe, Xiluo, Zhonghuo, and Beijing have convened the village chiefs separately and urged the people to thoroughly destroy the highways in their respective jurisdictions every day, with more than 300 workers in each village. In addition, the section from Shentang Market in the county to Mao Tengdu Ferry has not yet been destroyed due to manpower constraints. In order to comply with military orders, a destruction team was specially dispatched yesterday to assist with the work and thoroughly destroy the section, while prohibiting vehicles from passing through. In addition, Xuwen, Qinlian, Hepu, and other counties have been ordered by the provincial government to continue to thoroughly destroy highways.

### Zengcheng Japanese Troops Plunder Grain Everywhere

[Shaoguan Special News] Since the Zengcheng Japanese troops were attacked by our troops a few days ago, many of their food and weapons have been seized by us. Now, due to lack of food, the Japanese troops in the city are plundering the nearby villagers everywhere. Where they pass, not a grain of rice is left, and the villagers are subjected to great suffering, and the situation is very tragic.

### Hepu County Buries Mother of Enlisted Soldier on His Behalf

[Hepu Express] Feng Zude, a citizen of Gaode Township in Hepu County, enlisted in the army a month ago and is now serving in a certain division. His mother, Ms. Su, who was in the village, died of illness on the 10th of this month, and the family was too poor to pay for her funeral. The township chief, Pan Junda, specially sent a letter to the 5th District Branch of the Committee for Preferential Treatment of Families of Anti-Japanese Soldiers in the county, requesting assistance in accordance with the preferential treatment regulations. After learning of the situation, the committee immediately allocated funds for the burial to show preferential treatment.

### General Bai Chongxi Has Left Northern Guangdong and Returned to Guangxi; Guangdong Generals Have Also Returned to the Front Lines

[Qujiang Express] Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Headquarters, arrived at a certain place in Northern Guangdong from Guilin on the 4th of this month, and immediately summoned Party affairs and military personnel in Northern Guangdong for instructions, and consulted with senior military and political generals in Guangdong on military affairs, and individually met with senior military personnel returning to Northern Guangdong from the front lines, inquired in detail about the war situation, and gave instructions on future Anti-Japanese War key points. Liang Hancao, Director of the Political Department of the Headquarters, who came with Director Bai, also discussed with the directors of the political departments of the army divisions of the Fourth War Zone on the promotion of troop and mass training in the future. Now that the inspection is completed, and important military affairs of the headquarters need to be handled, Director Bai, accompanied by Director Liang Hancao, has left Northern Guangdong and returned to Guangxi a few days ago, and the generals of Guangdong, Yu Hanmou, Deng Longguang, and Ye Zhao, have also returned to the front lines after Director Bai to plan and launch a counterattack.

### Provincial Health Department Sends Personnel to Inspect Local Health Reports; Busy with Wartime Work Everywhere, Unable to Take Care of It

[Qujiang Express] In order to understand the local health facilities and to provide separate guidance, the Provincial Health Department sent Su Liuzhao, Director of the Rescue Section, to inspect areas such as Yingde, Qingyuan, Sihui, and Guangning. He has now completed his mission and returned to the department to report. It is reported that the governments of the various counties are mostly busy with various wartime tasks, and funds, talent, and medicines are insufficient, so they have hardly taken care of health facilities. At the same time, they regard rescue and treatment as the entire health undertaking, because the responsibilities of the health department and the health office system are not very clear, and they have not widely prepared for it. As for various places, private doctors with a good reputation have moved far away for treatment, and pharmacies have raised the prices of medicines. For example, in Qingyuan County, vaccination costs one yuan per time, and Jianlian pills have risen to six cents per pill, and Jianlian injections cost more than ten yuan per time. However, many villagers in Qingyuan are willing to take on rescue work, so there are still enough rescue team members to dispatch. In Sihui City, only Huici Hospital can provide medical treatment and vaccination. The tax police regiment and its four corps regularly dispatch and assist in rescue work. Yingde Pingmin Hospital is currently preparing to reorganize into a health office and also run a hospital. Many local doctors in Guangning County have not been approved to officially practice, and the source of medicines is very small. During the inspection period, Director Su also convened discussion meetings at any time to discuss health issues in each county, and gave detailed instructions on the health offices, county hospitals, rescue teams, schools, health, and the establishment of rescue stations in each county, and the handling of guidance work was still smooth.

### The Southern Battlefield of the Dong River

— Shi Yuan

As for the fighting strength of the people here, it is also not weak. When Wan City and Shi Long fell and the [Japanese] invaders conducted their first mopping-up operation, the people of Da Lang Market, under the leadership of the Model Volunteer Corps, engaged in fierce street fighting with the [Japanese] invaders. More than one hundred armed volunteers struck over a thousand strong [Japanese] invaders. Although they suffered more than ten casualties, the [Japanese] army suffered several times more casualties than us, filling a whole truck to transport back to Wan City. This glorious and heroic resistance made the [Japanese] invaders feel very tricky and difficult. On the other hand, it greatly enhanced the confidence of the people.

Unfortunately, because they did not receive strong guidance and assistance, this vast civilian armed force could not be organized, and some that had been organized (such as the Model Volunteer Corps) could not continue due to funding and various difficulties.

Even more unfortunately, these great civilian armed forces, lacking proper organization and leadership, are sometimes incited by local bullies and ruffians to engage in armed fighting. Recently, there have been heartbreaking incidents of brutal armed fighting between two clans near Da Sha on the front line, using machine guns against each other.

(4) Hardworking Young Patriotic Soldiers: Although the environment is harsh and difficult, the national salvation work here will not stop because of this. There are still many enthusiastic young men and women scattered in various villages, supporting it arduously. They never give up their fighting positions, go to Hong Kong or other safe places to become refugees. Some even resolutely sever ties with their families because they oppose the shamelessness of their fathers and brothers becoming submissive citizens. Their ambition not only overcomes the oppression and deception of the [Japanese] invaders and traitors but also overcomes the attacks of hunger and disease.

Recently, they have transformed from individual combat to establishing a unified "Dongguan People's National Salvation Work" with the help of military and political authorities. This new force, which has grown up in arduous struggle, will surely set off a huge wave of resistance in Dongguan and shatter the [Japanese] invaders' new conspiracy.

However, we cannot hide the fact that many serious crises and weaknesses still lurk in the southern battlefield of the Dong River. They have caused us a lot of losses and difficulties, and we have missed many favorable opportunities.

(1) The [Japanese] Invaders' Appeasement Policy: Since suffering serious blows in the first phase of the war, the Japanese invaders have switched to a so-called "appeasement" policy. This policy is manifested in Wan City and Shi Long in the following ways: First, temporarily suspending the slaughter policy; second, selling a large number of inferior goods to the people at low prices; third, using traitors to implement enslavement education and deceptive propaganda; and fourth, establishing exchange offices where Japanese military currency can be exchanged for Chinese national currency at any time. Therefore, many backward people are deceived and willingly become submissive citizens.

(2) Activities of Traitor Puppets: For several months, the Japanese invaders in Wan City and Shi Long seemed to be very quiet on the surface, without any aggressive actions. But in fact, their conspiracy is even more vicious than in the past. Although they are adopting a defensive posture militarily, they are actively attacking politically, trying their best to buy and train traitors, and consolidate the organization of the puppet regime. They are also intimidating the people near the [liberated] areas in many ways, coercing them to establish puppet maintenance associations, attempting to gradually narrow the scope of our guerrillas' activities and even eliminate our guerrilla bases.

(3) Deterioration of Military-Civilian Relations: Speaking of the officers themselves, there are also many serious weaknesses. The fighting morale of the middle and lower-level troops is not strong enough, and the atmosphere of prostitution and gambling is more prevalent than in the past. Some newly formed guerrilla units are even more corrupt: issuing fake passes, extorting, robbing, and engaging in private activities like bandits (in fact, a small part of them were originally bandits, so the people are full of complaints, even saying that they are "more miserable than the Japanese soldiers"). Although this is only a small part of corrupt behavior, because they are carrying the banner of the guerrillas, ordinary people with simple minds have an extremely bad impression of the entire unit, giving the [Japanese] invaders and traitors a very good opportunity to sow discord.

(4) Weakness of Administrative Organs: Although we still retain a vast administrative territory in this guerrilla area, because of the difficult environment and the intimidation of [Japanese] invaders and traitors, many village heads and heads of pao-chia dare not take their responsibilities seriously and express their intention to resign. For example, many important laws and decrees of the government cannot be transmitted to the lower levels for implementation, forming a state of anarchy. This is also one of the reasons why traitors are more easily active.

(5) Unclose Relations Between Allied Forces: Because many of the troops here have been transferred from other places, and two units are newly organized armies, there are differences in education and combat capabilities, and there are good and bad military disciplines. Because of this, there are some gaps in everyone's daily relations, and they unintentionally despise each other. This phenomenon often affects the spirit of practical cooperation in combat.

The overall situation of the War of Resistance has entered a more favorable stage. Because of the increasing anti-war movement at home and the widespread development of our guerrillas, the [Japanese] invaders' conspiracy of a quick victory will become more active. Their plan to consolidate the rear and their attempt to attack the southwest and northwest are proceeding simultaneously. Therefore, we must not forget the [Japanese] invaders' conspiracy to open up the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway just because we see that the [Japanese] invaders in Dongguan and Shi Long are temporarily adopting a defensive posture.

Brothers and sisters on the south bank of the Dong River, fellow countrymen from Dongbao living abroad, let us urgently mobilize to assist the government army, to overcome the above weaknesses, to support the War of Resistance on the south bank of the Dong River, to crush the [Japanese] invaders' conspiracy to open up the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, and to support all forces!

...End...

May 13th, at the Front Line of Dongguan

### World's Fair Film Exhibition - For Example, the "Transportation and Traffic" Category is Divided into Political, Educational, and Commercial Categories

In the New York World's Fair, which opened on April 30th, film also occupies a considerable military position. However, among the fourteen items exhibited at the conference, it is neither independent nor belongs to the "Entertainment" or "Art" categories, but is included in "Transportation and Traffic." Why put film in "Transportation and Traffic"? This was decided by the conference authorities after deliberation because they believe that film can transmit news and introduce the customs and news of various countries to the audience. Its contribution to transportation and traffic is greater than "Entertainment" or "Art."

This film exhibition is completely free to visit and is divided into three categories according to its nature: political, educational, and commercial.

Among the political films, the most recommended is Cecil B. DeMille's "America in Progress." In addition, the British participated with several documentaries in the name of the Film United Federation. France has the most travel shorts, and the Soviet Union also has several feature films that combine technology and story. Among the smaller countries, Belgium's industrial and landscape shorts (21 in total) are the most worth seeing.

In terms of educational films, MGM, Paramount, RKO, 20th Century Fox, Warner Bros., Universal, and other film companies have entries. Various states in the United States also have films describing their state's scenery, products, culture, customs, etc., totaling 48 films.

In terms of commercial films, a short film from the world-famous American MacFadden Publishing Company is the most noteworthy. This short film is only four reels long, but it cost a huge sum of US$50,000. Child stars the Maz twins play key roles in the film. The story tells of a company's growing prosperity due to the power of advertising. Of course, the purpose of this film is to attract stores and companies from all over the world to advertise in the company's publications.

There are also two cartoons. One is Walt Disney's "Mickey Mouse Rally," made for the National Biscuit Company. The other is a rubber puppet film made by the American petroleum industry, depicting the importance of petroleum to human life. Because the performers are elastic rubber people, it has opened up a new path for film art. Therefore, in terms of creative value, this cartoon surpasses the "Mickey Mouse Rally."

The fair also set up a film review committee to classify and critique the exhibited films. The winners are awarded medals and certificates.

### Shaw's Famous Plays Continuously Appear on the Silver Screen - Clark Gable Will Star with Wendy Hiller in a Film

We have already enjoyed Shaw's "Pygmalion." The producer of "Pygmalion," the Hungarian Gabriel Pascal, was originally a friend of Shaw. The film rights to almost all of Shaw's famous plays belong to him. After "Pygmalion," at least the following three plays will continue to be filmed:

(1) The Doctor's Dilemma: This play chronicles an American revolutionary story. Wendy Hiller will still play the female lead. It is said that Wendy Hiller was personally recommended by Shaw to play the flower girl. She has now signed a five-year contract with Pascal, and her position on the silver screen will naturally gradually rise. The male lead belongs to the famous Clark Gable.

(2) The Devil's Disciple: Pascal has long wanted to film this script, but Shaw believed that the play was too intense and might be opposed, so he filmed "Pygmalion" first. It is now scheduled to be filmed after "The Doctor's Dilemma."

(3) Caesar And Cleopatra: This play is a romance set in Roman times. Cecil B. DeMille once filmed a "Cleopatra" based on this story. Of course, in Shaw's script, there are also his own views.

After these films are made, they will all be distributed by MGM.

### Hollywood Star Representatives - Continued

Jack Oakie: Jack is good at playing promoters, but he also played the "Accordion Player" once. "A Parisian Woman" gave a very good impression.

Jimmy Durante: The first thing that comes to mind is his big-nosed pranks, "The Passionate Plumber".

Joe E. Brown: The wide-mouthed star's "Alibi Ike" is the most comical.

Boris Karloff: What left the deepest impression on the audience was "Frankenstein."

Johnny Weissmuller: In "Tarzan and His Mate", his second Tarzan film, there is a most wonderful performance.

James Cagney: "Yankee Doodle Dandy" is of course his representative work.

William Powell: Powell has had few works in recent years. "My Man Godfrey", which he co-starred with Myrna Loy a few years ago, can be considered the most outstanding.

Paul Muni: It can be said that Paul's films are all of high quality. "The Story of Louis Pasteur" was selected as one of the top ten blockbusters last year. It is a pity that it cannot be shown publicly in Shanghai. Comparing "Scarface", "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang", "The Life of Emile Zola", and "Juarez", it is agreed that "The Life of Emile Zola" is the most outstanding and refined.

### Pygmalion (6) - Produced by MGM - Original by George Bernard Shaw - Starring Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller

Higgins did not know how to answer. Because, less than twenty feet away, Carpathia was talking to Eliza. He hated that man in his heart, but there was nothing he could do, and he could not get away for a while. When he did get away, Carpathia walked towards him, with a smug look on his face.

"Miss Doolittle is very humorous," he said and walked towards a group of reporters.

A female reporter asked, "Oh, Mr. Carpathia, who is Miss Doolittle?"

"I already know everything about her. She is—" He stopped talking, leaned down to the female reporter's ear, and whispered, "I think she's just a slum girl."

"Are you crazy!" Carpathia said mockingly, "I—Alexi Carpathia, your best student, know she must be a princess!"

Higgins breathed a sigh of relief at this time and calmed down. "Okay! Whatever you say," he said softly.

The next morning, when Mrs. Pearce brought in the tea, she said with a bitter face, "Eliza is gone."

"Gone?" he asked in return, and then woke up. He remembered that she insisted on going home last night.

When they got home from the dance party, although they were grateful that they had not failed, they were very tired.

"Thank God, it's finally over," he had said, yawning. "I can go to sleep in peace. Where are my slippers?"

"Here, here," Eliza threw the slippers over angrily, "You thank God it's over, but what about me? What about me?"

"You won't have any problems," he said worriedly.

Their arguments were not out of their own wishes. Higgins never thought that one day this matter would turn into nothing. But now Eliza is gone. Really gone!

He asked the police to investigate, but they could not find her whereabouts. "What are these police here for?" he angrily scolded the police on the phone.

### South China Football Team Painfully Defeats Foreign Sailors Yesterday - Score of 6-0 is a Comfortable Victory

Yesterday at 5:30 PM, the South China Southern Tour football team played a friendly match against the British Navy's HMS Gannet at Jia Hill. The match was originally scheduled to start at 5:00 PM, but due to the death of a colleague on the ship, the funeral was held in the afternoon, and all the crew members went to participate, causing a delay and postponing the start time.

The South China team was about to set off, but the players had not yet been selected. Team Leader Mo specifically scheduled this match to review the strength of the players as a basis for selection.

Liu Songsheng, who had been retired for a long time, played yesterday, acting as the right inside forward in the first half. His footwork was as good as before, and his dribbling was also agile. He played right midfielder in the second half, but his strength was slightly lacking. When Zhang Jinhai guarded the front line, his skills were mediocre and he did not show his talent, but after Songsheng changed positions, he was able to score two goals in a row, which was very active. Luo Douwenzu played the left wing and worked very hard. The two drawbacks of good dribbling and greed for credit were eliminated one by one, and the passing was also considered passable. Liang Baiwei performed quite well, and his position was also good. Tan Zhenhui had sufficient strength, but his experience seemed to be lacking. The rest of the generals were able to perform at their original level. Center Chen Dehui also stood out.

The foreign sailors focused on defense rather than offense. Old Man Bagu's skills were proficient, and he was able to advance and retreat appropriately. His skills were no less than the minister's. The two inside backs were also very likable. They blocked the South China forwards in the first half, preventing them from having any shooting opportunities, and lost 0-1 first. After about fifteen minutes into the second half, Martin had cramps and left the field and could not play anymore. The South China forwards scored several goals in a row, resulting in a huge score of 6-0. The battle situation is as follows:

After the two armies came into contact, Dehui, Beihua, and Songsheng divided their forces and advanced, and Kansi, Martin, Garia, Guba, and Dan Lister fought head-on.

In the fifth minute, Shuiyi attacked from the side, and Jili Daru blocked the ball out of bounds. South China took a corner kick, but it did not achieve anything. In the eighth minute, Shuiyi made a surprise attack on the side. Dehui also broke in at the same time, and shot fiercely at the attack. Jili Daru bravely扑the ball out. Shuiyi fired again, and Kansi defended and resisted, and the ball went wild.

In the tenth minute, Beihua and Shuiyi went east and west, Dehui crossed into the阵地, and fiercely shot. The ball was as fast as an arrow, and Jili Daru could not save it. 1-0 South China won first.

In the twelfth minute, Dehui came back, and Martin飞身力拒, De煇扫射攻门, and the ball hit the post, bounced out, and Martin力救得免. At the same time, McNerney Yunshi, Phirux, and others launched an attack, but they did not succeed.

In the nineteenth minute, Dehui sent the ball far to Douwen, and then took advantage of the emptiness to break in, approached the goal, and fired a shot, which hit Jili Daru's foot.

In the 21st minute, Douwen越过Martin, Shuiyi invaded at the same time, and shot strongly at the attack. Jili Daru saved quickly, and passed the dangerous pass. Already Shuiyi forced a corner kick, the landing point was适中, Jili Daru拒出门外, Douwen came to fire, and hit the斗柱, as if entering the treasure mountain, and returned empty-handed. The first half ended with the sailors losing 0-1.

After exchanging positions, South China changed the position of Songsheng to defend the center, and Jinhai was transferred to the front line, making the military appearance even more glorious. In the fifth minute, the sailors tried to recover the lost ground, and Somas made a side吊攻门, and Rongcai援救得力化险为夷.

In the tenth minute, the sailors went down in five ways, frequently园攻 South China's阵地. Yi Yunshi suddenly fired a cold arrow, and Rongcai bravely saved the sailors and retreated in frustration.

In the fifteenth minute, Douwen and Dehui rushed into the sailor's阵地, Kansi came to meet them, Dehui's foot head rose, and 2-0 won again.

In the eighteenth minute, Dehui raised troops, and Beihua策应赶来. Guba and Martin failed to effectively resist, and Beihua swept into the net, 3-0.

In the 20th minute, Beihua捲土重来

Jinhai奋身直入, and fell into another city, 4-0,

In the 22nd minute, Douwen傍传, and Jinhai immediately fired at the door, and the ball hit the door post. Only South China's锐气 was盛, and Songsheng intercepted Beihua and passed it to Dehui again, and it did not辱命, and built another achievement, 5-0,

In the 28th minute, Qingcai送一程, Jinhai斗前迎顶, and the ball卽进入网内, 6-0, at this time the sailors tried their best to hold on, and ultimately the general trend had passed and they could not do anything. When the gold was 收军, the sailors were慘败 with 0-6. The阵势 is as follows:

### Preliminary Floor Exercises

— Zou Falu

The history of floor exercises in our country is still very short. During this short period, it is certainly not easy to make it a common material for physical training throughout the country. However, this kind of exercise has its unique value, especially in today's all-out war of resistance, where physical education must be coordinated with military affairs, its importance is particularly evident. Let me first talk about its value and the matters that should be paid attention to in its implementation:

The movements of floor exercises, such as: rotation, somersault, handstand, somersault, etc., can develop the habit of tumbling and rotating, adapting to the needs of aviation technology, ingenuity, agility, and liveliness, can develop the technology of adapting to changes, adapting to the environment of close combat. It is a true full-body exercise. Between a jump, a leap, a roll, and a somersault, it is particularly beneficial to the stimulation of internal organs and the exercise of the torso. It can cultivate vitality and adapt to the final persistence of the protracted war of resistance. It does not require much equipment. In addition to a few mats, it requires nothing else, which can save money and conserve financial resources for the war of resistance. These are all directly helpful to the war of resistance. As for its lively movements, in addition to building up the body and defending the country, it can also develop the lively nature of the practitioners, especially the rest.

The most exquisite method of making mats is to use cotton wadding with palm fiber skin on both sides as the lining, and to use canvas as the surface. The surface must be sewn firmly every foot or so vertically and horizontally to prevent the cotton wadding and palm fiber skin from shrinking into a ball. If you are a little more careless, you can weave rice straw into a mat, and cover the surface with sackcloth and mats, which is economical. If you are simple, you can weave grass into a cushion, or you can do it on flat ground.

The storage of mats is also a very important issue. The most important thing is not to get wet in the rain, so that it cannot be used next time. After use, the dust must be wiped clean and placed in a high place to avoid contamination, which is detrimental to hygiene during exercise.

Before implementing floor exercises, some preparatory exercises must be done first to warm up the body. The best preparatory exercise is jumping. When doing it, the practitioners can be instructed to run around one side of the mat in a circle, and when they run to the mat, they will do several kinds of jumping exercises in sequence.

Floor exercise is a kind of exercise that combines skill and beauty, not an exercise that uses brute force. Therefore, the movements must be done according to a certain method; at the same time, it requires courage and meticulousness, so the movements cannot be rough and careless. If these two principles are violated, it is often easy to be dangerous.

The movements of floor exercise are done by one person, or by a combination of many people. The difficulty is clearly divided. Anyone can learn step by step, but the advanced and difficult movements require considerable practice. Some preliminary movements are introduced here. It is inevitable to miss something. Please correct me.

Before talking about the movements, I have a small statement that I hope the reader will pay attention to, that is, the following movements have a classifying nature, but it is not a strict classification. The difficulty of the movements is not in the order of the total order. Each category has different levels of difficulty. A movement has several ways to do it, and if the method is the same, or the method of this type of movement is the same as that of another type of movement, it will only be noted in the description, and it will not be listed one by one. Most floor exercises can be done continuously, although not every one is noted, the practitioner must know it.

### The So-Called "China and Commerce Bank" and Its Appointment

— Hanhui

The so-called "China Xing Commercial Bank," jointly established by the Nanjing "Reformed Government" and Japanese banks, was established in Shanghai amidst the disastrous fall in the price of "Lian Yin" notes in Tianjin. According to Chen Jintao, the "President" of the bank, and Tsuda of the Xingya Institute Liaison Department, "The bank has a capital of 50 million yen, half from the Japanese and half from the puppets, and will issue 'China Xing' notes with the same value as the legal tender," and "can freely exchange foreign debt." Tsuda also said that "Japanese residents will first use its banknotes." Many people believe that the disastrous fall in the price of "Lian Yin" notes in the north, which wanted to replace the role of the legal tender, has failed. Today, they still want to promote "China Xing" notes in Shanghai and the Jiangnan region, which is very incomprehensible. In fact, this issue is by no means as simple as people generally imagine, and it is worth careful study.

The development process of imperialist economic aggression is from commodity export to capital export. However, the era of capital export does not stop commodity export, but needs to expand its commercial export to increase its capital accumulation. The purpose of capital export is to control the finance and industry of the colony, especially the monetary system of the colony. The so-called US dollar group and pound sterling group are the most successful manifestations of capital export. Because Japan lacks raw materials for heavy industry and its industrial base is built on light industry, the balance of international revenue and expenditure depends entirely on the export of light industry, even the export of semi-finished rural products (such as silk), which is more than the export of capital. Except for some achievements in the three eastern provinces, it cannot compete with the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Moreover, its main raw materials for light industry, such as wool and cotton, still need to be imported from abroad. After the "September 18th Incident," the invasion and seizure of the four eastern provinces of China certainly solved its lack of raw materials for heavy industry, but the lack of main raw materials for light industry has not yet been solved. In order to solve this difficulty, there is the specialisation of Inner Mongolia and North China, and the so-called yen group movement jointly organized by Japan, "Manchukuo," and China. However, Japan's operation of the four eastern provinces has exhausted most of its capital, and it has no surplus to realize this conspiracy. Moreover, due to the success of the central government's legal tender policy and the firm support of the North China authorities, the so-called Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and the yen group plan have all failed. After the Japanese army occupied North China, the "United Reserve Bank" established by the "Peiping Provisional Government" issued "Lian Yin" notes. The plan was to fundamentally eliminate the legal tender and make it the only currency in the north, realizing its yen group conspiracy. However, in fact, the power of the legal tender in North China is by no means as fragile as that of Feng Piao. Therefore, the "Lian Yin" notes have been promoted under the force of the Japanese army for more than a year, and are still limited to some Japanese military strongholds, and have not become the only currency in the north. There are many reasons for its failure. Generally speaking,

(1) As a result of Japan's long-term war of aggression against China, public bonds were issued indiscriminately and the currency was inflated. The price of the yen fluctuated, and the price of the "Lian Yin" notes linked to the yen inevitably plummeted.

(2) The legal tender is fully prepared. Recently, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund has been established, and the "black market" in Shanghai is also relatively stable. The people have a consistent belief in it.

(3) The ruling power of the Japanese puppets is still confined to some urban strongholds, and most of the land is still under the rule of the central government.

(4) The silver in the Tianjin concession area has not been robbed successfully, and all foreign banks in the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have refused to accept "Lian Yin" notes.

(5) Lian Yin notes have no reserves, and the amount of issuance is very large, resulting in rising prices and plummeting note prices. (The Tianjin market price of counterfeit notes has fallen to only about six jiao of legal tender.

To (6) The recent victory of the central government's military counter-offensive.

Therefore, "Lian Yin" notes are only forcibly circulated in the northern cities occupied by the Japanese army, and once they enter the countryside, they become the world of legal tender, and there is no room for "Lian Yin" notes to circulate. Japan's conspiracy to issue "Lian Yin" notes to replace the legal tender can be said to have failed in the north. However, it has achieved considerable success in using "Lian Yin" to control foreign exchange, restrict import and export trade, and promote the sales of Japanese goods. This can be proved by the sharp increase in imports of Japanese goods and the sharp decrease in imports of goods from European and American countries in the first quarter of this year.

When the Japanese army initially occupied Shanghai and Jiangnan the year before last, it forced the use of some military tickets. Its original intention was that once these military tickets were used in the occupied areas, it would only cost some printing fees to exchange them for huge amounts of agricultural products free of charge to fill its light industry raw materials and food to save its collapsing economic structure.

Overseas Economic Conditions

As for the economic situation abroad, under the situation of tense diplomacy and arms race, the phenomenon of recession is also more common. Taking the United Kingdom as an example, the whole year has been in the process of recession. According to the London Economic Magazine's industrial activity index, it has fallen continuously from 111.0 in December last year (1935 as 100) to 100.5 in December this year, a reduction of about 10%. Prices have also fallen, while the number of unemployed workers has increased. The reason is that it was initially affected by the sharp fall in US prices and the stock market, and then foreign trade was increasingly sluggish due to the insecurity of world politics, resulting in the deterioration of the balance of international payments. The position of the pound sterling is particularly weak. In September, due to the Czech issue, the diplomatic crisis was urgent, and the exchange rate between the British and American currencies continued to decline, reaching more than four yuan and six jiao. In the United States, the economic situation in the first half of this year has not improved since the stock market turmoil in the autumn of last year. However, after May, President Roosevelt expanded the budget again and spent a huge amount of relief funds. Due to the increase in market chips, various industries gradually became active, and stock and commodity prices rebounded. At the same time, the inventory of bulk commodities has been greatly reduced since the production cut last year, and domestic and foreign preparations for war are becoming more and more urgent, and the need for military equipment is very high, so industrial production has been stimulated, and export trade can also slightly maintain the level of last year. The situation is better than that of the United Kingdom. In France, prices have continued to rise due to the devaluation of the franc, but the production index has only slightly increased by the end of the year, and the number of unemployed people has not decreased. Moreover, due to the expansion of armaments, the budget deficit has increased day by day. At the end of this year, a new fiscal and economic plan was implemented, extending the working hours of workers to increase production, reducing government expenditures, and improving tax collection in order to balance the budget and strengthen the government's financial organization in order to attract the return of funds. Various economic conditions are in the process of adjustment. As for Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and other countries, under the control of the economy, preparing for war is the only purpose, and various plans are being promoted to achieve economic self-sufficiency. Whether the people's lives are improved or not is no longer the current important issue. Looking at the economic conditions of various countries, although they are not as directly affected by the war as our country, they have lost their normal development due to the war and the war-related relations. They all sacrifice everything to seek the enrichment of military power. From now on, the hope of world peace is almost in danger. This is something that we cannot fail to bear in mind when observing the domestic and foreign environment. (End)

Free Talk

### Village Talk

— Zhuli

Without a hometown, letters from home are no longer as nagging as before, and they never mention a word about anything other than family matters: how the place was lost, how it was lost, and how another kind of "organization" is brewing, how it is being ruled.

However, I completely understand the reason for this silence. Letters that can slip from the inspector's hands into the mailbag, written in crooked characters with a long-abandoned writing brush, always say the same things: there can be no new horrors, new threats, and countless new taxes in the area. At the same time, there cannot be no growth of hatred, resistance, sniper cases happening everywhere, and guerrilla warfare rising up. The army that appeared in the posture of conquerors could not but bribe on the one hand and suppress on the other. A local gentry who once ran rampant with dozens of old Mauser pistols from the bandit era is now actually a prominent ruling class or represents the ruling class with a ferocious face; and a peaceful village may be burned down and become ruins because it is located on the retreat route of the guerrillas, or for no reason at all.

These are the expected disasters. But every time I finished reading the letter from home, I was at a loss. What I got was not what I had prepared for. Is this believable, everything in my hometown is still the same, the killing has stopped, and I can still live peacefully as before, is this also believable, the place is quiet, people are rearranging their lives and careers under the rule of the conquerors, without hatred, and without guerrilla warfare?

It cannot be like this. In the past, we were used to it. We were protected by our own army. We were familiar with the names of every tax and every person who collected the taxes. They came, handed over the money, the receipt, that was such a distrustful certificate, we felt no need, and refused to take it. Even if it was stuffed into our hands, we did not value it, and just stuffed it into a corner that we could not even find.

Now the people who come to knock on the door with money bags are no longer familiar. We heard the unheard-of taxes from the mouths of those wolves, and when we heard them, we had to hand over the same amount of money. We were not allowed to say a word we wanted to say. This is already a world of ghosts and demons. People have human relationships, but these relationships no longer exist. It is useless to argue, and it is impossible to argue.

In the past, we went out without any worries. We walked long distances, and it was night. We rushed home and knocked on people's doors, or stayed in temples on the way. Now even a traveling merchant has to be locked at home. Not necessarily at night, but during the day, stepping out of his own home, a white bayonet will block the way. "Pass," this is our own land, the road we built, but there is a yellow obstacle standing on the road, holding a sharp gun, and the bayonet on the tip of the gun is blocking people's way.

Even people who shut themselves at home all day long cannot live a quiet life. It is not as if someone breaks into the house for no reason, loots the house, and tears down women. Why? Even our own doors cannot be opened or closed as we please, and a quiet family will be interfered with. Not only outside, there are yellow obstacles standing at every pass, but the yellow obstacles are entrenched in every corner. They can break into the house at any time, loot the house, and tear down women. Why is this? Is it just to search for "good citizen certificates?"

There should be countless disasters, and these tragic encounters can happen to people at any time. In the past, we continued our lives to enjoy life, but now! There is endless pain in life, and life is so fragile and tragically covered with permanent shame.

Although we believe that this shame can be washed away with blood, it has been a whole year since we lost our hometown. At first, I was so anxious to see and hoped for some news from home, but the news was so cut off. Later, finally, like other places, letters were able to pass again. I eagerly unfolded every letter from home, but what I got was not what I had expected. I was at a loss.

I suddenly remembered from the confusion that the same pair of scissors can cut off the news of the activity of wandering in the war zone and the homesickness of the "conquerors" sent to their homes across the sea.

### Depression—In Hong Kong

— He Lijiang

This piece of happy land after the war of resistance. To me, it seems like a desert. On this desert, what I feel is: loneliness, monotony, spiritual hunger, mental depression, sorrow of encounters, and a bleak future; however, my will is like iron, and of course, we are not pessimists.

My depression, I believe many young people feel it too, because there really isn't much work to do here. The adverse environment, the darkness of society, the hypocrisy of human relationships, if you haven't mastered the art of flattery and boasting, it's very, very difficult to find something to do, truly as difficult as ascending to the blue sky.

Although the Westernized environment is liked and enjoyed by a large number of people, hedonists indulge in spending extravagantly, with gold and paper in a drunken stupor, amidst wine, green lights, theaters, dance halls, tour agencies, restaurants, etc., there's no shortage of places to get intoxicated. Of course, these stimulants and narcotics naturally suit their tastes.

Deception, constraints, lack of freedom, no work to do, a life without interest, and a lack of meaningful and proper entertainment, therefore, spiritual hunger and mental depression are what many young people feel.

Golden light and a foreign atmosphere envelop this place, confusing the minds of many people, numbing their nerves, and dazzling their eyes, making them forget their origins and why they left their beautiful hometowns to come here. And what banner is this under? What kind of politics? What kind of place is this? Why is it like this? They couldn't care less. The behavior of the upper class is even more jaw-dropping.

In short, in terms of living: rice is as precious as pearls, firewood as valuable as cassia, and every inch of land is worth gold. Except for certain inferior goods, the price index for many clothing and household items is very high. Capitalists and landlords are making a fortune from the national crisis. In Hong Kong, I only feel countless sorrows and depression.

### Draft Before Battle

— Li Liwen

1.  I Have a Gun

I have a gun, and it's a Type 79 rifle.

I can't help but feel proud...

The blood all over my body is boiling because of this, vibrating intensely,

I seem to be unable to hold back,

I want to fire the gun,

Whoosh——

I cocked the gun and loaded a row of bullets.

Then, I likened myself to a true soldier.

So, under the dark night, I quietly and alone remained in the plains, on

the banks of the paddy fields where the rice seedlings had just been planted,

I even climbed the earthen mound,

and also ascended the majestic mountain range:

There, I held the gun and looked out over the ground,

Towards those mountains, waters, and the green fields, I couldn't help but laugh softly,

I murmured to myself: I am indeed the guardian of the motherland!

2.  An Intense Battle Awaits Me

An intense battle awaits me,

But I am not flustered at all,

Instead, I am more calm and more encouraged,

I began to sever all attachments,

I only use an angry heart to call out to myself,

Therefore, my blood is even more boiling,

I eagerly await the arrival of the battle,

I can't bear to wait any longer,

I want to fight,

I want to annihilate my enemies,

I know very clearly: the motherland will grow in battle.

I gripped the gun tightly, so excited that I was almost crazy,

Motherland, the freedom and light of the motherland!

3.  I Cherish the Bullets

When I received the heavy bullets, I trembled with excitement,

I gently stroked them,

I stared at their light reflecting in the sun,

I cherish them,

I counted them carefully:

One two three four five...

I counted them again and again,

My hope rests on every single bullet,

I want every bullet fired to blossom with my flower of hope,

I want every bullet to exchange for the life of a × person,

How much I love them!

I circled them around my waist, like receiving a hug from a dear person,

And when I felt that burden...that weight, the joy I felt was indescribable!

### Literary Criticism in a New Stage

— Jie Ru

In the entire literary movement of China today, it is very obvious that creative practice cannot keep up with the objective reality of the war of resistance. However, there is something even more serious than this, and that is the great backwardness of critical practice. Since the start of the war of resistance to the present, the struggles of the past twenty-odd months have triggered infinite development and changes within our nation, greatly altering the appearance of China's reality. However, our literary critical practice and theoretical activities not only cannot keep up with the reality that is in a state of intense transformation at all times, but also cannot catch up with the creative practice that has already fallen behind reality. This undeniable backwardness is undoubtedly a loss for today's Chinese literary movement and a loss for the cultural struggle for the liberation of the Chinese nation.

Literary theoretical activities and critical practice should always stand ahead of creative activities, providing creative activities with constant guidance, review, and encouragement. Especially in today's newly emerging Chinese literary movement, whose foundation is still very fragile, creative activities need the cultivation of theory and criticism as much as an infant needs milk and a tender grass needs dew. It must have the guidance and support of sound theoretical activities and critical practice in order to achieve rapid and normal development. However, the backwardness of theoretical criticism in today's Chinese literary movement has caused creative activities to lose the milk and dew they need, and to lose their guiding center. This lack of nutritional materials is the most important reason why the Chinese literary movement has consistently failed to break out of the stage of immaturity and poverty, and has failed to keep pace with reality in every subtle and tortuous stage of development.

This serious backwardness in theory and criticism must be overcome quickly. For the sake of the development of our literary movement and the complete accomplishment of the anti-Japanese tasks in literature and art, people have often focused on strengthening literary theory and critical activities in the past. However, even today, as the war of resistance has increasingly deepened and moved into a new stage, and has brought many newer, more serious, and more urgent tasks to the current literary movement, our literary theory and criticism have still failed to achieve the truly expected strengthening or development. This is obviously a major defect. If we do not promptly carry out this aspect of supplementary work today, then the literary movement of tomorrow, which is also the literary movement of today, will inevitably lose its color and become greatly detached from today's intense reality of national liberation. Because reality is progressing, our theory and criticism must stand vividly at the forefront of every developing link of reality at any time and anywhere, enlightening literary creation with new paths that adapt to each link of reality, guiding its development, critiquing its work, and strengthening its struggle. Only in this way can the literary movement be closely linked to the reality of the war of resistance, mutually communicating and influencing each other, thereby enabling it to fully accomplish all the tasks it undertakes. Conversely, if theory and criticism cannot exert their leadership and critical responsibilities, then the separation of the literary movement from the reality of the war of resistance is inevitable, whether today or tomorrow.

Strengthening and deepening theoretical and critical practice in the literary movement has undoubtedly been handed over to all Chinese literary workers today. This is one of the greatest and most urgent tasks of our Chinese literary workers in the new stage of the war of resistance. We cannot neglect this work, just as we cannot neglect our combat on the action front. Today, we have a new necessity that compels us to adopt a comprehensive critical review of our past literary critical theoretical activities, targeting our current objective anti-Japanese sentiment, and adapting to the great historical tradition of our nation, to build new theories and new criticisms that adapt to the new situation and new stage; to improve the theoretical understanding of our literary movement, to deepen the understanding of the general literary workers regarding the essence and turning point of the current stage of Chinese history, as well as the center and trend of the new stage of the real situation, to construct the basic methods of purely realistic, sinicized literary creation and criticism, based on our national revolutionary movement, based on the characteristics of our nation, and based on the content of the life and habits of the Chinese masses who are in hard struggle today, to lay the foundation for the complete system of Chinese literary theory - this is our greatest work today, the most meaningful work.

The increasingly serious and deepened real struggle in the new stage of the war of resistance demands that literature and art reflect and promote the struggle in reality with greater sensitivity and mobility. Therefore, the literary criticism in the new stage must first propose new creative centers in the course or development of every real struggle, point out the standard paths that current literary reflections need to follow, and regard the work of linking and coordinating the struggle of literature and art with the struggle of reality as its basic task. Therefore, our critical practice and theoretical activities today must complete its mission with a high degree of sensitivity, just as the famous Soviet literary theorist I. Bespalov said, it must "on the one hand, make a summary of the times, and on the other hand, review the habits of literature from the style and style, only in this way can it not only give the possibility of evaluating literature, but also give the possibility of proposing new topics to literature."

The demands put forward by the new stage for theory and criticism are not only to continuously propose new topics for literary creation ahead of every development and leap, and to help and urge it to complete the work of these new topics, but also to demand the deepening of theory and criticism itself, because if theory and criticism itself cannot be deepened, then it cannot effectively lead the literary creation and literary struggle, so it must intensify its own training work, actively study the new aesthetic relationship to reality, explore new aesthetic ideals and new forms of popularizing literary criticism that are being formed, and engage in the creation of new aesthetics that concretely express the demands of our current reality on art.

The literary workers group is a great educational group. They need to educate the Chinese masses today to live and struggle, but they also need to be educated themselves. They need to obtain education from the middle of literary theoretical activities and critical practice. Therefore, in the new stage of the war of resistance, I need to deepen the work of educating the educators.
