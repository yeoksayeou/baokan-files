### Internal Contradictions in Germany

— Mo Fu

Fascist Aggression: Germany, after annexing Czechoslovakia and Memel, continues its aggressive atrocities. However, this mad nation is strong in appearance but weak in reality, and its very existence is collapsing. Its aggressive atrocities advance more fiercely, deepening its own contradictions and difficulties. Moreover, its mad actions are precisely driven by the deepening and sharpening of domestic contradictions and difficulties.

The fascist German rulers and spokespersons always claim that Germany has no crisis. This is simply untrue and a lie to cover up the facts. In reality, it is the complete opposite of their lies.

It is true that Germany does not yet have a crisis of overproduction. But this is not because Germany's economy has truly "prospered." No, it is because Germany, ahead of other capitalist countries, especially other fascist aggressive nations, has completely transformed its economy on the principle of war. The lives of workers, peasants, and the general working masses have not only not improved in the slightest (which is impossible), but have greatly deteriorated amidst Germany's frenzied arms build-up and violent aggression.

German workers work more than sixty hours a week. And wages are constantly being reduced. Five years ago, Hitler clamored for women to return to the kitchen, completely dismissing female workers from factories. Now, because of the frantic expansion of armaments and the need for men in the army and in military factories, women are being called back to the factories. Moreover, not only are women being called back to factories, but handicrafts are also being destroyed, and handicraft workers are being dragged into factories. According to official German statistics, the number of self-employed handicraft workers has decreased by more than 100,000 in the past year alone.

Speaking of production, it is generally declining. In the past five years, the growth rate of industrial production has been decreasing every year, eventually stopping completely. In 1934, industrial production increased by 33 percent, in 1935 by 18 percent, in 1936 by 13 percent, in 1937 by 10 percent, and in 1938 by 5 percent. This 5 percent increase is not a real increase, because not only is the Saar region included, but Austria is also included, with a population increase of more than six million. So, in fact, Germany's industrial production did not increase at all in 1938. As for the production of consumer goods, it has increased by about 2.5 percent each year in the past five years. However, if we consider the increase in the country's population (that is, Germany's population has increased by more than ten million after occupying the Saar and Austria), then it has not only not increased, but has decreased.

Although Germany has not yet been embroiled in a large-scale war like Japan, the German workers, peasants, and general working masses have suffered the pain of poverty and hunger and the hardships of the First Imperialist War under six years of fascist rule. Goering wants to "replace butter with cannons" and "replace bread with cannons," which is to prepare for aggressive war by sacrificing the lives of the masses and lowering their living standards. For the sake of aggression, raw materials for textiles needed for war are imported from abroad, while the people are made to use all kinds of expensive and inferior substitute raw materials. However, the actual wages of the masses continue to decrease, and they cannot even afford such things. Not to mention buying ordinary military supplies, even the food needed every day is not enough. According to the official statistics of the fascist authorities, in 1939, Germany itself could only guarantee the supply of 82 percent of the food needed. That is to say, even if this statistic is reliable (the statistics of the fascist authorities have always been falsified), there is still a shortage of 18 percent. Does this not tell us in fact what "replacing bread with cannons" means? Furthermore, Germany, in order to "replace bread with cannons," makes the masses grit their teeth, tighten their belts, and eat less. A kind of food coupon is issued, not for equal distribution to ensure that everyone gets enough necessary food, but to make the masses eat less.

Attempts to increase agricultural production have all failed. Under fascist rule, the lives of peasants are extremely difficult. The fascist authorities have, in fact, prohibited free trade in rural areas. The crops that peasants have worked so hard to obtain cannot be freely sold on the market. Peasants must "contribute" all of their produce to the fascist authorities' grain stations, or "sell" it to merchants entrusted to collect tribute grain. And the banking sector does not provide any loans to peasants, and peasant debt is increasing day by day. In 1938, only 3 percent of peasants were not in debt, and the amount of debt owed by general peasants was as much as 70 percent of the value of the peasants' property.

The lives of workers, peasants, and the general working masses are deteriorating, while military spending is increasing in proportion to the suffering of the people. Fascist Germany has never published the amount of military spending. Even for general state expenditures, only income is published, and not expenditures. Military spending from 1937 to 1938 was about 24 billion marks, and from 1938 to 1939 it was 35 billion marks. With state revenue of 71 billion marks in 1937, military spending accounted for about 33 percent of the total. This is the huge military expenditure that can only be obtained in a situation of hunger and poverty for the people. This is the truth of "replacing butter/bread with cannons" and the most concrete numerical expression.

The resignation of Schacht, the president of the German national bank, clearly shows the difficulties of the German economy. This is a manifestation of the development and sharpening of contradictions. Schacht advocated easing the arms build-up. However, Hitler would not agree. Hitler would not ease the arms build-up because of domestic economic difficulties, but would instead increase armaments and invade other countries more vigorously because of economic difficulties and the deepening of domestic contradictions. For this, he would not hesitate to adopt any means, even adopting inflationary policies, to achieve his goals. In this situation, Hitler granted his resignation.

The internal contradictions in Germany are deepening in this way. The more the masses suffer, the more it will arouse the people's anti-fascist and anti-aggression sentiments. And the increase of this sentiment will develop more strikes economically, further increasing the difficulties of fascist rule. Politically, it will cause larger-scale strikes and anti-fascist and anti-aggression mass movements, and this movement will become increasingly powerful, and will have practical results for curbing aggression. At the same time, it will increase military difficulties. This is not only because the growth of the clandestine anti-fascist movement will inevitably extend to the soldiers in the army, greatly affecting the morale and combat capabilities of the soldiers, but there will also be many difficult to overcome difficulties in the quantity, quality, supply, and transportation of munitions. In short, the contradictions within Germany, first of all, the contradictions between the German proletariat and the fascist financial oligarchs, the general people who love and are semi-opposed to aggression, and the fascist rule, as well as the internal shields of the rulers, will all unfold completely. If, when Germany advanced into the Sudetenland, South Korean workers and the general people, as well as soldiers, launched powerful movements to prevent the departure of troops and the departure of trains, then without a doubt, today, when Germany is carrying out large-scale aggression, this anti-aggression action must be carried out effectively. We have not obtained these materials, mainly because of the brutal censorship of the German fascist authorities. In the continued development of this situation, German fascist rule will walk into its grave.

### A Week in World Affairs

— Pan Lang

From April 2nd to April 8th

During the first week of April in Hong Kong, although there was a sudden cold spell, the sun had already shone across the land, inspiring people's hearts.

During the first week of April internationally, although the clouds of war remained dense, the dawn of light had also begun to break through, invigorating the spirit of the soldiers.

In Europe, the London Anglo-Polish negotiations resulted in the formation of a defensive and offensive alliance between the two countries. Britain's proactive movement for an anti-aggression bloc is gradually making progress, refreshing the eyes and ears of the world. However, fascist aggressors remain arrogant and domineering. Italy has already launched a military offensive against Albania, and Germany, after its eastward European offensive has somewhat stabilized, is preparing to turn its spearhead westward!

In the Far East, Japan's military adventures in China have suffered setbacks, and the situation in various war zones is becoming more favorable to us. Moreover, the exposure of the secret Wang Jingwei-Hiranuma agreement reveals the treacherous plots of anti-communist peace negotiations, which will also encounter major blows. Looking at the overall situation, we can still feel reassured. However, Japan's ambition to dominate China has not suffered a fatal blow. The occupation of the French-owned New Southern Islands (Spratly Islands) further illustrates Japan's provocations against Britain, France, and the United States, as well as its behind-the-scenes conspiracies.

1.  The Anglo-Polish Defensive and Offensive Alliance and the Anti-Aggression Bloc Movement

After British Prime Minister Chamberlain declared at the end of March that Britain would firmly guarantee Poland's independence, Polish Foreign Minister Beck immediately traveled to London on April 2nd. The Anglo-Polish conference opened on the 4th, and it is said that a defensive and offensive alliance between the two countries was signed and established on the 6th. On the 6th, Chamberlain announced the progress of the talks in the House of Commons, saying: "The scope of the Anglo-Polish talks is extensive, and the two countries have agreed to conclude a permanent and reciprocal agreement to replace the guarantee that the British government recently offered to Poland. Both sides also agreed that the contracting parties are free to enter into treaties with other countries for the purpose of securing peace." Mr. Chang also reported that the Anglo-Polish agreement is similar to the Anglo-French agreement, while Britain and the Soviet Union continue to maintain close contact and have informed the American authorities of the progress. Looking at the Anglo-Polish negotiations, the German authorities' angry condemnation and anti-British movement after the fact, and further threats to Poland, urging it to withdraw from the Anglo-Polish alliance, show that this diplomatic activity of Britain is quite resolute in striking at aggressors. According to a Havas News Agency dispatch from London on the 4th, "Britain is considering using military means to consolidate the peace front. War Minister Hore-Belisha reported on the 4th that the General Staff is conducting negotiations with France, Poland, and other countries participating in the anti-aggression bloc to establish a 'Military Strategy Bureau'." A Central News Agency dispatch from London on the same day also stated: "The British government is now striving to organize an anti-aggression bloc, the nature of which is like the various Holy Alliances of the Napoleonic era. The main significance of the anti-aggression bloc is to establish a relationship of solidarity among the participating countries, mutually defending independence." The objects of negotiation will also include countries such as Romania. British diplomatic authorities have also held talks with the ambassadors of Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Greece on April 1st. Similar negotiations are also planned with Bulgaria, Turkey, and even the Scandinavian countries. From this, we can see more clearly Britain's trend toward confirming its position on fascist aggression, abandoning its policy of appeasement, and adopting a policy of active resistance. However, its determination is not yet strong enough, and its measures are not yet thorough enough. Therefore, in order to effectively prevent aggression and ensure peace, the first requirement is to truly consolidate and expand the anti-aggression front, which must include at least the Soviet Union; the second requirement is to expand its application to the entire world, which must include at least the Far East. At the same time, this movement cannot be led by Britain alone. At the very least, it is necessary to promote a united front of people from all countries against fascism and aggression, in order to guarantee the development of peace in all countries, especially the active policy of the British government.

2.  The Soviet Union and the United States Promote the Democratic Peace Front

As for the Soviet Union and the United States, their enthusiasm for uniting democratic countries against fascist aggression has recently become even more fervent. The Soviet government's official newspaper, "Izvestia," pointed out that Chamberlain's guarantee of Poland's independence was "ineffective," while quoting the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a conference to establish a comprehensive anti-aggression declaration. In addition to the countries concerned, the conference should be attended by various democratic small countries and the Soviet Union, and its scope should be extended to the Far East. The Soviet Union declared that only the rapid establishment of a collective security system can guarantee world peace. Soviet Deputy Defense Commissar Kulik clearly declared: The Soviet Union is prepared to cope with any contingency. The Soviet Union does not fear any foreign threat, and the Soviet Union does not seek help from alliances with any foreign country. This declaration is a timely blow to the few who suspect that the Soviet Union will be exploited, and it has a significant driving force for consolidating and expanding the peace front.

On the American side, under the leadership of President Roosevelt, the anti-fascist, anti-aggression movement is continuing to surge. Former Secretary of State Stimson has further advocated that "if Soviet Russia and Britain join forces and are drawn into the vortex of war, the United States should also enter the war to aid Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in defending democracy and world peace." The conspiracies of some isolationists and reactionary elements in the United States, although they have not suffered a fatal blow, have been greatly reduced in their ability to do evil. For example, Pittman's proposed amendment to the Neutrality Act was unanimously attacked by the country, and the "cash and carry" provision in the Neutrality Act was the focus of the attack. Stimson sternly pointed out: (1) Pittman's proposal would allow the United States to become the main supplier of raw materials for Japan's military, and the restrictions of the Neutrality Act would be even more relaxed than at present; (2) If China wants to buy goods from the United States in the future, it must rely on ships from other countries to transport them, and the United States will not be able to provide loans in the future; (3) The commercial and cultural relations between the United States and China in the Pacific will decline day by day. Our country has also launched a campaign to urge the United States to pay attention, and to demand that the Neutrality Act be repealed, distinguishing between aggressor and victim countries, and adopting different policies. The European and American anti-aggression societies have also jointly called on relevant groups to respond to our country.

3.  German, Italian, and Japanese Military Plans and Italy's Invasion of Albania

The aggressive powers of Germany, Italy, and Japan have begun to tremble under the surging anti-fascist, anti-aggression tide. Their current problems, in addition to the increasing contradictions between them, and the increasing internal crises in their respective countries, are mainly how to strengthen mutual coordination, and intensify military adventures and speculations, so as to break through and suppress the democratic peace front before it has reached the necessary degree of consolidation and expansion. Reuters finally reported on April 5th that German and Italian military leaders are conducting staff talks! It was also said that "German Chief of Staff General Keitel held talks with the Italian Minister of the Navy and Chief of Staff in Obersalzberg on the 5th and 6th." According to a Havas News Agency dispatch from London on the 1st, "Official communiqués indicate that large German and Italian armies are massing on the borders of Yugoslavia and Italy. It is said that Italy has launched a diplomatic offensive against Yugoslavia to ensure that it does not take military action when Italy makes a request to Albania for Italian protection." A dispatch from Rome on the same day stated: "Hitler spoke to Mussolini by phone at length this morning, and it is said that Hitler expressed his agreement with Italy's military preparations."

According to various reports, while Germany is assisting Italy's development in the Mediterranean, the second step of its offensive is being actively arranged. Now that it has obtained considerable satisfaction in Eastern and Northeastern Europe, it is beginning its Northern European and westward offensives, not only intensifying its seizure of small countries dependent on Britain and France, but also preparing to attack France. The latest plans of the three countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan, are for Japan to first threaten Annam, and then threaten the interests of France, Britain, and the United States in the Far East. Now the first step is to occupy Hainan Island, the second step is to occupy the New Southern Islands, and the third step is also being prepared. Germany, in addition to plundering the small countries of Northeast and Central Europe, will further threaten the communication between Britain and Africa. Italy, on the other hand, is launching military operations in the Mediterranean. This invasion of Albania is also considered the first step in implementing its new plan!

Italy has already implemented a total mobilization of its naval, land, and air forces to annex Albania. This military speculation and adventure stems from the predetermined steps of the aforementioned new plan of the aggressive bloc, and its ultimate goal is not limited to annexing Albania, but also has the significant implications of threatening Yugoslavia, Greece, and even the Balkan Peninsula countries, and controlling and blockading British and French communications in the Mediterranean. In fact, the positions of Britain and France in Europe and even the Near East have been subjected to even greater persecution! It is reported that Albania is determined to resist to the end. Fierce fighting has occurred in Albanian territory on April 6th and 7th, and Britain has declared that it will take retaliatory action, from the Anglo-Polish defensive and offensive alliance to the conclusion of a military alliance, and the active development of the anti-fascist movement, etc. The struggle between the two fronts has begun to be staged dramatically.

4.  Japan's Forcible Occupation of the New Southern Islands Alarms Britain, France, and the United States

The fascist aggressors first choose to attack the weak. The German aggressors, who advocate anti-communism and anti-Sovietism, are now approaching the Soviet Union, but suddenly turn their artillery to prepare for a westward advance; while the Japanese aggressors, who shout the same slogans of anti-communism and anti-Sovietism, do not hesitate to submit to the Soviet Union with a second northward approach, but suddenly turn their warships southward to launch a fierce attack on the spheres of influence of Britain and France, forcibly occupying the French-owned island of "Typhoon" (Spratly Island, known in Chinese as the New Southern Islands) at the end of February. Japan forcibly occupied Hainan Island, then the Xisha Islands to the south, and now it has forcibly occupied this Typhoon Island. The various countries of Britain, France, and the United States cannot but be shocked by this sudden storm. The island is located in the center of Annam, the Philippines, Singapore, and Borneo. After Japan occupies the island, it maintains contact with Hainan Island and Taiwan. First, it naturally threatens the security of French Indochina. Second, it may be possible to control the Philippines, which is an important base for the United States in the Far East. Most importantly, Britain's "lifeline" of Far Eastern strategy, the communication network from Singapore to Hong Kong, is in danger of being severely cut off. Japan's collusion with Siam (Thailand) can become closer, and the Indian Ocean and even the entire Nanyang (Southeast Asia) are under Japan's threat.

Japan's forcible occupation of the New Southern Islands, as mentioned above, is also a predetermined step in the new offensive plan of the fascist aggressors, in order to contain Britain and France, and coordinate with Germany and Italy's offensives in Europe, Africa, and the Near East. The main goal is to threaten Britain, France, and the United States to abandon their policy of aiding China, and to induce Britain and France to mediate the Sino-Japanese war in order to force China to submit. The biggest and final attempt is to exclude all the forces of Europe and the United States from the Far East, in order to achieve its so-called "East Asian New Order." Looking at a Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing on the 6th, "The Japanese government has also decided on several political conspiracies against us, and ordered its military leaders in China to implement them earnestly: (1) to blockade the rights and interests of Britain, the United States, and France in China as much as possible, and to try to coerce and lure Britain, the United States, and France to act as mediators; (2) to express extreme goodwill to Britain, the United States, and France on the surface, while secretly preparing to seize all their territories in the Far East at the opportune moment; (3) to vigorously propagate anti-communism and anti-Sovietism as a smokescreen to deceive the world."

The various countries of Britain, the United States, and France have expressed close attention to Japan's atrocities and conspiracies. France has also lodged another protest, but it has been rejected by Japan. Now Britain and the United States have jointly managed Canton and Enderbury Islands in the Pacific, which fact is an unraveling of the contradictions between Britain and the United States in the Pacific over the years, and a powerful response to Japan's atrocities. However, the thorough and effective step lies in the active cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Pacific, and must also include the Soviet Union and China, establishing a collective security system to jointly resist the aggressors. Objective conditions are gradually becoming available, and we must intensify our efforts!

5.  The Exposure of the Secret Wang Jingwei-Hiranuma Political and Military Agreement

After Wang Jingwei responded to Japanese Prime Minister Konoe's declaration and committed the crime of betraying the central government and leaving the motherland, he accepted Japanese economic support and military and political orders, and constantly planned conspiracies of "anti-communism," "peace," "mediation," and "direct negotiations." We have repeatedly pointed out that his actions are contrary to the interests of the country and the nation, and contrary to the will of the people, and pointed out that such conspiracies will never succeed. However, we cannot allow him to continue to do evil and cause harm. He is extremely bold and launches even greater conspiracies. Unfortunately, some people value personal relationships, and blind and shameless people are willing to directly or indirectly echo him for some kind of satisfaction. The general public still believes that Wang and his followers, and the words and actions of his propaganda organs, still have some humanity, and still have some concern for the country and the people. But since "Mr. Riji" published "An Example" in April, it has clearly declared that it is willing to help China and Japan negotiate directly as a pro-Japanese faction! It has also publicly stated that if the Chinese government does not negotiate peace, then "even if I leave the country, I will definitely come back," that is, come back to be a Japanese puppet to organize a puppet central government. At this point, Wang has already proven his traitorous identity, and even a few blind people cannot but admit that they have been deceived, and express their hatred. Following this, Wang's conspiracy with Japan has also been partially exposed, especially the "Secret Agreement between Wang and Hiranuma" published by various newspapers in Hong Kong on April 6:

First, Japan should launch attacks from three directions: (1) In North China, Japan must occupy Xi'an in order to secure Sichuan and cut off communication between China and the Soviet Union; (2) In South China, Japan should occupy Nanning in order to suppress the anti-Japanese situation in the province and cut off communication between the province and Vietnam; (3) In Central China, Japan should occupy Changsha in order to cut off the Xianggan Railway, and occupy Xiangfan in order to block communication between Shaanxi and Hunan.

Second, after Japan completes the above arrangements, Wang himself will lead the anti-Chiang and anti-communist war.

Third, Wang will be responsible for organizing an Anti-Communist National Salvation Alliance, with himself as the head of state.

Fourth, discuss the conclusion of an agreement to restore peaceful and friendly relations between China and Japan.

Fifth, in order to realize the second and third points, Japan should pay 2 million yuan. It is reported that the Japanese side has already paid twice. It is also said that the content of the secret agreement was reported by a Mr. Xia (transliteration), who was a Japanese translator at the time, and that the Chinese authorities only learned of it then. (Reuters, Chongqing, 5th) It is also reported that Wang's conditions for taking office as a puppet leader are:

(1) The abolition of the two puppet organizations in the north and south; (2) The establishment of a new national government in Nanjing; (3) The establishment of an Anti-Communist National Salvation Alliance first; (4) An activity fund of 2 million yuan per month; (5) The organization of 12 divisions of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army; (6) A loan of 2 million yuan for military expenses; (7) Wang and the Japanese side will re-establish a new agreement based on Konoe's statement; (8) In international relations, the original principle is to contact Germany and Italy, and to win over Britain and the United States; (5) To join the Anti-Comintern Pact.

Although this secret agreement has been exposed, Wang and his followers and propaganda organs continue to exist, and Wang's conspiracy with the Japanese may inevitably produce even more shameless and shocking performances! Therefore, all parties are calling for the purge of pro-Japanese traitors, confiscating their property, banning their newspapers and magazines that are used by them, and expelling them from all nationalities of the Republic of China. The central government has also announced news of severe punishment. People in all areas, especially the press, should be extra vigilant against pro-Japanese traitors! Because only by thoroughly purging all traitors can we guarantee that the War of Resistance will be victorious and the nation will be built successfully!

6.  A Week's Situation in the War of Resistance and Progress in Military and Political Affairs

The War of Resistance Against Japan in the past week has shown the increasing strength of our army's combat effectiveness, and Japan's new military adventures and speculations have again suffered setbacks.

First, looking at North China, as a result of the war of resistance in the past week, the Japanese offensive in Shanxi has collapsed, and the plan to "sweep away" the Zhongtiao Mountains has again been frustrated; on the contrary, the guerrilla warfare we have launched in North China has made progress, and there have been dramatic battles in various places in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces, and our army is particularly active in the Suiyuan area. A telegram from Wuyuan on the 6th said that our army has broken into Bailingmiao. According to statistics released by the responsible agencies in the Northwest Region since the start of the war (see the third page of today's newspaper), the ratio of casualties between our army and the Japanese army has undergone a dramatic change. Before March of the 27th year of the Republic (1938), when positional warfare was the main form of warfare, for every three soldiers we sacrificed, the Japanese sacrificed one. However, after March, when we adopted mobile warfare and fought under the leadership of the united front, when we attacked the strong, we exchanged 1.4 of our soldiers for one Japanese soldier; when we attacked in transit, we exchanged two of our soldiers for five Japanese soldiers; in night attacks, we exchanged one of our soldiers for four Japanese soldiers! This scissor-shaped difference is now developing, which proves that we are getting stronger as we fight, and that a prolonged war of resistance will surely be victorious.

Next, regarding Central China, after capturing Nanchang, the Japanese originally planned to advance on Changsha, cut off the entire Yuehan Railway, and consolidate the occupied areas in the southeast. However, due to the excessive sacrifices made during the capture of Nanchang, and the main force being divided and weakened, coupled with the terrain being favorable to us, and the proper use of our military strategy, the main force of the Japanese army is now trapped and unable to advance. Subsequently, they retreated and attempted to intensify the "sweeping away" of the occupied areas, especially the New Fourth Army attacking the border areas of Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu. However, since the central government sent Mr. Zhou Enlai to Zhejiang to inspect the eastern front and convene important military conferences in Tianmu Mountain and other places, not only has the fighting on the Qiantang River developed (such as firmly defending the south bank and the coast, breaking into the north bank, and attacking Wukang and Hangzhou in separate groups), but also around Taihu Lake, all the Shanghai-Nanjing, Nanjing-Shanghai, Suzhou-Jiaxing, and Nanjing-Hangzhou lines will also have important developments. It is not surprising that the Japanese army has made no progress in the past week.

Finally, the situation in the South China theater is still extremely tense. In the past week, Jiangmen has been lost and regained twice, and Xinhui has been gained and lost again. The fighting has been fierce, breaking the combat records of the South Guangdong battlefield. After suffering heavy losses in South Guangdong, the Japanese should begin to recognize the true expression of the Guangdong spirit. Now, our army in the southwest is actively launching a general counter-offensive, and the air force is heavily mobilized to assist in the battle. The situation in the North River has suddenly become tense, and the momentum of our army in the East River is even greater. If this counter-offensive can continue, contain and consume the Japanese army in and around Guangzhou, then militarily, we can strike at the Japanese plan to aggressively attack the southern route and threaten Guizhou and Yunnan, and politically, we can strike at the emergence of a pro-Japanese puppet regime in the southwest that is actively being brewed. However, after the Japanese army was defeated by us in places such as Jiangmen, Jiujiang, and Xinhui, they are now fleeing to Taishan and Guanghai, and the Japanese army's movements to land in places such as Fangcheng are becoming more and more fierce. The situation in the southern route is now urgent, and Guizhou and Yunnan are threatened. This is something we cannot ignore.

The central tasks of the recent Japanese invasion plan in China are nothing more than (1) strengthening the rule of the occupied areas so that their outer edges are not attacked by our army; (2) eliminating guerrilla teams so that their oppression and looting are not hindered; and (3) organizing a puppet central government that is enough to command the people and launch a large-scale "new life" and "construction" plan.

In various places, party and government committees and sub-branches have been announced as established, and the central government is also striving to improve the military and political affairs in the guerrilla areas, such as unifying the administration within the guerrilla areas, strictly handling personnel appointments and removals, abolishing exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, improving people's lives, and developing local products. These are the main conditions for guaranteeing that the current war of resistance will enter the stage of victory and eliminating the Japanese offensive. In addition, the provincial councils of Jiangxi, Henan, Guangxi, and Guangdong are also following the example of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and are preparing for establishment one after another. If the public opinion organs in various places can be established and improved as soon as possible, they will be able to truly mobilize the vibrant power of the broad masses of the people, smoothly overcome the current difficulties, and consolidate the foundation for final victory.

### Night Talks on the Xiang-Gui Railway: A Friend of China in China (2)

— Ye Juesun

Li Meng and his wife both wore a round badge on their chests with the words "Friend of China." This was a souvenir given by the International Association. The outside was a red circle with the white Esperanto words "Amiko'e Clno" on the upper arc, and the Chinese characters "中國之友" ("Friend of China") on the lower arc. In the center of the outer circle was a small circle with a blue background, inside which were two large hands clasped tightly together, and in the space behind the hands, half of the sun from the Party emblem. Many coolies at the ×××× station and soldiers waiting for the train gathered around these two guests who could not speak Chinese. At half-past seven, the train slowly left Guilin Station, and we leaned against the side, taking advantage of the remaining light of the setting sun to survey the cliffs on both sides of the railway. The carriages from the Beining, Pinghan, Miaoji, Jinpu, and Zhegan railways were gathered on the Xiang-Gui line, a situation symbolizing wartime cooperation in China.

The Hengyang-Guilin section of the Xiang-Gui Railway was opened to traffic on August 1, 1938, coinciding with the first anniversary of the outbreak of the War of Resistance. Therefore, we cannot but admit that the Xiang-Gui Railway was truly a harvest in the midst of the war. Without the war, this major north-south transportation artery spanning Hunan and Guangxi provinces would not have been completed so quickly! The original plan was for the Xiang-Gui Railway to run from Changsha to Guilin. However, because of the completion of the Yuehan Railway, the Xiang-Gui Railway could be connected to the Yuehan Railway in Hengyang. Therefore, the old plan was changed, which not only helped transportation but also saved a lot of time and materials. At the same time, the southward shift of the Xiang-Gui Railway's terminus was also very significant from a military point of view. Otherwise, after Wuhan fell and Changsha was plunged into chaos, Guilin would have been greatly affected, and it would certainly not have been as stable as it is now! On the other hand, if the Xiang-Gui Railway had stopped in Changsha, it would have increased Changsha's military importance, because the Qian-Xiang Highway also ended in Changsha. Then, if Changsha were to fall one day, the enemy's mechanized units could directly threaten Guiyang and Guilin, and control South China. Therefore, although the change of the Xiang-Gui Railway's terminus was a small matter, its significance was great.

The sky gradually darkened, so we returned to our room to rest. The tea attendant lit a candle. This attendant used to work on the Jinghu Railway. His attitude was very kind, and his service was very thoughtful. He seemed to feel it necessary to explain to these two foreign guests why there were no electric lights in the first-class carriage. This kind-heartedness moved the Li Mengs very much. Mrs. Li said, "Chinese people are indeed better to Westerners. Everyone is very warm." Hearing the tone of this sentence, I continued to ask them about their impressions during their two months in China. Li Meng said: "We have been to very few places in China, only a few major cities such as Kunming, Chongqing, and Guilin. In Chongqing, our impressions were mostly of the government. In Guilin, my observations focused on the people. Now, we are going to the Guangdong front line, and we hope to see more of the soldiers' lives and heroic combat situations. When I first arrived in China, I felt the same as other foreigners who had just arrived: is this group of scattered farmers, chaotic small handicraftsmen, and small merchants... truly conscious of the nation and a sense of national identity? This is certainly a very important question. The answer to this question can not only indicate the course of the Sino-Japanese War, but also relate to the entire destiny of China. My answer is that the national spirit of the Chinese people is constantly growing and strengthening! From this point of view, we can see: first, there is no so-called "split" between provinces here; second, every political party has put national interests first and is working solely for the future of the country; third, all military officials have been concentrated under the leadership of the central military supreme authority. Of course, in Shanghai and Hong Kong, we have no way to find any signs of a new China being produced. We can only collect these new phenomena in the central provinces of China, in the interior of China, and in areas close to the war zone. The first place I saw was Yunnan Province. In Yunnan, I noticed that this was a place that had been isolated from other provinces for a long time, but after the start of the War of Resistance, it consciously and automatically contributed its greatest strength to this war to drive out Japanese imperialism. This courageous dispatch of troops proves that Yunnan can become China's greatest force in supporting the War of Resistance to the end..."

"After leaving Yunnan, I arrived in Chongqing and was honored to be able to visit this wartime capital of China. At the same time, I also had the opportunity to discuss various issues with many important officials in the central government. I met the leaders of all parties and factions, and the leaders of many mass organizations. I not only talked to the leaders of all aspects, but also discussed with many members of the groups! I not only talked with friends who were members of the Kuomintang or sympathetic to the Kuomintang, but also with many people who had previously been regarded as enemies of the Kuomintang, or who had lost their freedom of political activity before the War of Resistance. However, everyone said in unison, 'We are willing to carry out the program of resistance and national reconstruction under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and to fight to the end for the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation!'..."

### The Focus of the War is Still in Jiangxi and Guangdong, with Fierce Counter-Attacks on All Fronts

[Special Dispatch from Guilin, This Newspaper, 8th] The focus of the war is still in Jiangxi and Guangdong. Our efforts to counter-attack are making steady progress. On other battlefields, we are currently engaging in guerrilla warfare. The enemy is actively attacking and searching for guerrilla teams in the occupied areas.

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 8th] According to reliable sources, the current war situation is stable. The number of enemy troops in China, except for a continuous stream of reinforcements, has not increased. There are currently a total of thirty-two divisions, together with special forces and naval landing forces, totaling 900,000 men. They are distributed across various battlefields and are only capable of attacking on one or two fronts, without the ability to launch a full-scale attack against us.

[Special Dispatch from Changsha, This Newspaper, 8th] The enemy has been concentrating forces from Nanjing and Shanghai towards Wuhan, and is shifting to reinforce Xiang and Hubei, attempting another fierce attack. We are on high alert.

The puppet troops in eastern Henan were terrified when they heard this.

The Enemy in Shanxi Encounters Setbacks Everywhere

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 7th] The enemy in Shanxi has been acting up recently, with the aim of blockading the Yellow River crossings in southwestern Shanxi. The enemy currently has no ability to cross the river. We have begun to attack the enemy.

[Dispatch from Xingji, Central News Agency, 10th] The enemy in Shanxi, northern Shanxi, and southern Shanxi has repeatedly carried out its so-called "mopping-up" operations. After encountering setbacks everywhere, it has recently drawn heavy troops from the Tongpu, Zhengtai, and Pinghan lines to besiege our southeastern Shanxi. Enemy chieftain Sugiyama arrived in Jiexiu a few days ago to plan this conspiracy. At the end of last month, the enemy in Pingyao reoccupied Dongquan Town (20 li southeast of the city). Four or five thousand enemy troops in Jiexiu advanced on Wanghe Town in five routes on the 3rd. Our troops fought bravely to block them on the Ziziping line (north of Qinshui), engaging in three hand-to-hand combats. After a fierce battle for half a day, more than 300 enemy troops were killed. Subsequently, the enemy released poison gas, and many of our officers and soldiers were poisoned, so they moved slightly south, attacking Hongdong, Fushan, Anze, and Taigu. The enemy also moved towards Zihongkou and Maling Pass, attempting to jointly attack Erqin (Qinxian and Qinyuan). The enemy has also increased its forces in Pinglu, Hesun, Jiezikou, and other places south of the Zhengtai Line. The enemy in northern Henan, Wuzhi County, She County, and Hui County has also increased its forces by more than 2,000. In the spring of last year, the enemy's "nine-route encirclement" suffered a disastrous defeat. Now, it is attempting to invade again and will undoubtedly be crushed by us.

[Dispatch from Xingji, Central News Agency, 8th] One of our companies, in cooperation with a unit of plainclothes troops, ambushed the area between Lishi and Dawu on the morning of the 1st. At about 7:00 AM, 160-70 enemy troops were marching north. When they were about 40 meters away from us, we launched a surprise attack, concentrating our fire on them. A unit of our ambush troops on the highlands also fired with machine guns. The enemy was caught in a crossfire and was unable to counterattack, leaving corpses strewn across the field. The enemy in Dawu heard the alarm and sent more than 300 reinforcements. The enemy's blockhouse also provided artillery support. We achieved our goal of annihilating the enemy and quickly disengaged from the battlefield. A total of 60 enemy troops were killed, including Captain Son Sam, Deputy Captain Bai Chao Hairetsuro, and Kakitsubo Hakuzo of the 3rd Machine Gun Company of the 119th Infantry Regiment. We seized six machine guns, one pistol, a camera, and a large number of documents, totaling 25 items.

[Dispatch from Xingji, Central News Agency, 8th] The Anze County Magistrate reported in a telegram on the 4th that our Ji Shi, in cooperation with the Dare-to-Die Corps, recovered the county seat at 2:00 AM on the 3rd. Fierce fighting is currently taking place on the highlands near the suburbs.

[Dispatch from Chongqing, Central News Agency, 8th] Military sources report that the enemy in Shanxi has repeatedly attempted to clear the Zhongtiao Mountains, launching repeated attacks, but all have been severely defeated and routed. Recently, the seventh attack on Zhongtiao Mountain was defeated by our army's brave counterattack. The details are as follows: Since the 20th of last month, the enemy in the southern Shanxi, Jiaodi area has launched a major offensive against our Zhongtiao Mountains from Hanyang, Yuxiang, Yuncheng, Anyi, Xia County, and other places, attempting to break through our army in one fell swoop with a divided and combined force. The enemy in Hanyang and Yuxiang fell into our inner city and joined the enemy in Jie Zhou on the 30th to attack Mona, engaging in fierce fighting with our army in Dagou Nan. In order to lure the enemy deeper, we voluntarily retreated to Xiaogou Nan. The enemy used aircraft and artillery to launch a fierce attack. Our troops fought to the death. We also used a strong force to outflank the enemy on the side from Jicun, launching a counterattack from both sides. Many enemy troops were killed. The enemy was defeated and retreated in a panic to Mona Town. Taking advantage of the victory, we launched a resolute pursuit and captured Mona on the 1st and recovered the inner city on the 2nd. The enemy fled back to its lair. The enemy in Anyi first launched an attack east from Gangu Kou with a partial force, but failed. Then, it attacked south from Zhangdian Town, engaging in fierce fighting with us at Fengxiekou and Li Cun. After repeated charges and counter-charges for more than ten times, the enemy ultimately failed. On the 30th of last month, our troops suddenly shifted their attack, defeating the enemy in front of them in one fell swoop and launching a violent pursuit, nearly disintegrating the enemy. The enemy retreated in disarray along two routes, through Dachen Cun, Yangzhao, Zhangdian Town, Xiangshu Qi, and Wu Jiagou, like dogs that have lost their homes. Our troops recaptured Yangzhao, Niucun, Baishu Qi, Wu Jiagu, and other places. In total, our troops shot down one enemy aircraft in this battle and killed more than 1,500 enemy troops. We seized countless weapons and ammunition.

### The Tragedy of the Shanghai Puppet Regime: It is Said That the Traitor Made a Fool of Himself

[Dispatch from Shanghai, People's Revolutionary News Agency] The Shanghai puppet municipal government has repeatedly tried to seize the Chinese courts in the two concessions. On the 10th of last month, Fu Xiao'an, the puppet mayor of Shanghai, presented the authorities of the Public Concession with so-called "five demands," one of which was to reclaim the Special District Court. As a result, the authorities of the Public Concession did not agree to his request because the identity of this "mayor of Shanghai" was highly questionable. After making a fool of himself, the puppet mayor Fu Xiao'an did not give up and submitted a so-called "protest" to the Public Concession authorities on the 29th of last month. The "protest" contained a set of nonsense, simply wanting the Public Concession authorities to acknowledge his "five demands." Regarding the item on reclaiming the First Special District Court, the text stated: "It is hereby noted that the agreement between the Shanghai First Special District Local Court and the related countries will expire on the 31st of this month. Before this government (the Shanghai puppet municipal government) takes it over, all civil and criminal lawsuits decided by the court will be deemed invalid from April 1, as stated in the protest of the 10th." What was the Public Concession authorities' attitude towards the "protest" submitted by the puppet municipal government? We can know by reading the words of a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council said: "The Municipal Council has no right to make any decisions regarding the jurisdiction of the First Special Court and the Jiangsu High Court. In 1933, the Chinese government and foreign representatives signed a court agreement, but the agreement did not expire on April 1, because the signatories had not issued a notice of termination. Therefore, this agreement will automatically be extended for another three years. The agreement on the Chinese Court in the Shanghai Public Concession was signed on February 17, 1930, and expired on March 31, 1933. After the expiration, it could be extended for three years with the consent of both parties. After the three-year extension period expired, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and the six countries of Britain, the United States, France, Brazil, Norway notified each other that they agreed to an indefinite extension. However, if any party wanted to revise the agreement, they should notify each other sixteen months in advance. Otherwise, it would automatically remain in effect. Now, neither party has given notice of revision in accordance with the regulations, so this agreement naturally remains in effect." This puppet mayor did not ask about his own identity and stubbornly "protested," making a big mistake. Fortunately, the traitor had a thick skin and did not care about the mistake.

In order to prevent accidents, the Public Concession police department dispatched Chinese detectives to strictly guard the court. British defense forces stationed in the court also added armed soldiers inside the court gate to assist the Municipal Council in guarding the area. All personnel entering and leaving the court were strictly questioned before being allowed to enter. As for criminal cases belonging to the various police stations under the Municipal Council, they were still sent to the First Special District Court for legal trial as usual. The traitor's dream of taking over the court for many years has been shattered by the facts.

Today (April 1) is April Fool's Day. An English mainland newspaper published a cartoon of Dr. Fessenden, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, riding a horse and inspecting the traitor. In the picture, Dr. Fessenden was wearing a Japanese military uniform, escorted by four Japanese soldiers. People who were unaware thought that Dr. Fessenden was really going to see the traitor. Then they realized that today was April Fool's Day. The traitor's dream of taking over the court and this picture are of the same nature - empty words. (Huang Jing)

### The Past of the Puppet Northwest Border Defense Army's Uprising in Sui: Political Workers Secretly Went to Promote It, and Guyang Uprising Inflicted Heavy Losses on the Enemy

[Dispatch from Xingji, Central News Agency, 8th] A certain military officer who recently returned from Sui reported on the process of Yu Zhiqian, Jun Chuan, and Jun Chuan's uprising in the puppet army. In July of last year, our army sent several officers, including Xu, to secretly enter the Yu Zhiqian's unit of the puppet Northwest Border Defense Autonomous Army to persuade them to revolt. At that time, Xiao Youtang, the commander of the 2nd Cavalry Division of the army, and Xia Junyong, the commander of the 4th Cavalry Division, expressed their acceptance. Xiao and others then led more than 2,000 officers and soldiers in an uprising west of Guyang on January 26 of this year, killing the two enemy advisors, Daga and Sato. After attacking the enemy's 3rd Regiment, they moved east, engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in Wuchuan, Baishen, Jining, and Fengzhen, and greatly destroyed the transportation, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Yang Zhen, the regimental commander of Xia Division, was gloriously wounded in the battle of Fu Shengzhuang. The Xia's two units have now arrived near a certain city. Our commander-in-chief recently sent someone to bring funds to inspect and comfort the officers and soldiers.

### Our Troops Attack the Enemy Near Guangzhou

At that time, eighteen Japanese journalists and photographers were returning by car after inspecting the war zone when they were attacked by the "remnants of the Chinese army" midway. The car overturned, causing one female photographer to die from her injuries.

### Wang Jingwei Scolds the War of Resistance and Issues Another Ridiculous Statement, Attempting to Gain the Appreciation of the Enemy

[Hong Kong News] Wang Jingwei's propaganda outlet in Hong Kong published an "important statement" on Wang's behalf last night, attempting to cover up the secret agreement he made with Hiranuma to sell out the country. The first point of the statement claimed that his advocacy of surrender was due to "unbearable" suffering, in order to prevent the country from being destroyed by the "Communists." The second point attacked the war of resistance, describing it as "destructive." The third point claimed that before the Lugou Bridge Incident, the Japanese originally intended "peace." (He did not mention a single word about Japan's occupation of the Northeast and its attempt to destroy our entire country). He further hoped that the "Japanese authorities" would give him the opportunity to make a "contribution" to "peace" in East Asia. At the same time as Wang issued the statement, the Hong Kong Japanese Daily, run by Japanese people in Hong Kong, greatly appreciated Wang and published a cartoon praising him.

### Peace and Tranquility in Eastern Zhejiang; Provincial Government Issues Order for Province-wide Household Registration Check

[Shanghai Dispatch] Since the turn of events in the Nanchang war, traitors have taken the opportunity to spread rumors and disturb the people. According to military leaders in Zhejiang Province, there have indeed been changes in the Jiangxi situation. Whether from a military or economic standpoint, [the enemy] lacks targets for invading Eastern Zhejiang. Moreover, the enemy forces in Western Zhejiang are weak, and our army's forces south [of Zhejiang] are several times greater than the enemy's. We can launch surprise attacks at any time, and the enemy is too busy protecting themselves to even think about crossing the river. Therefore, Eastern Zhejiang can be described as a defensive posture ready to strike and is absolutely safe. As for the rumors in the Ningbo area, they are all misunderstandings. In fact, the situation in various counties of Eastern Zhejiang is as peaceful as usual. Furthermore, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has stipulated that a province-wide general household registration check will be conducted from April 1st, and all counties have received orders to comply.

### British Ambassadors to China and Japan Discuss Rights and Interests in China; Archibald Clark Kerr Leaves Shanghai for Hong Kong and Chongqing Yesterday; Sir Robert Craigie Issues Statement Before Departure

[Reuters, Shanghai, 8th] British Ambassador to China Archibald Clark Kerr left here today aboard the Swire Shipping vessel "Taiyuan" for Hong Kong, en route to Chongqing.

Many of my predecessors traveled via sea to assume their posts, but I traveled via Canada, so I never had the opportunity to come to Shanghai before. I would like to state unequivocally that this trip to Shanghai has no political significance and no mission whatsoever. Ambassador Clark Kerr's trip to Chongqing is a separate decision and has absolutely no connection with my visit to Shanghai."

### A Glimpse of Chongqing

—Jun Sui

Xinjiang Travelogue, Part Two

(Special Correspondent for This Newspaper) Chongqing is located in the southeastern part of Sichuan Province, at the confluence of the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers. It was originally a mountain city and merely a relatively important commercial port on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Since the War of Resistance, the National Government moved from Nanjing to Chongqing, making it the provisional capital of China. Since the retreat from Wuhan last year, it has become the transportation hub for the southwest and northwest, and is regarded as the most important metropolis in the country, both politically and economically. Although I have been in Chongqing for five days, the inconvenience of transportation has prevented me from visiting everyone I wanted to see, especially the locations of the various ministries and commissions, which are mostly in the Shangqingsi area, more than ten li away. Every day, going back and forth takes up most of the day without finding the people. Now, let me report to the readers on the current situation of Chongqing in various aspects that I have seen in the past few days.

Chongqing is the continuation of the mountains of Lushan and Lutou Mountain. It extends towards the middle of the Yangtze River and Jialing River, surrounded by water on three sides and connected to land on one side. The north city is located on its northern side, separated from the Jialing River by a narrow strip of water, and the south faces the Yangtze River. Looking down on the entire city from the highest point, it is like autumn leaves floating in the middle of the two rivers. Fifteen li away from the land, there is Futu Pass, which is shaped like an owl's head. If Futu Pass is cut off, Chongqing can become an isolated island. Chongqing occupies a key position for water and land transportation, leading eastward to Hubei, westward to Chengdu, southward to Guizhou and Yunnan, and northward to Hanzhong. It is not only a hub for transporting goods between the southwest and northwest, but also a strategic point that military strategists must contend for, and can be regarded as the throat of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. An ancient poem says: "A leaf floats and sinks in the land of Ba, the two rivers embrace Futu Pass," which truly captures the essence of Chongqing.

The population of Chongqing was only over 400,000 before the war. Since the National Government moved to Chongqing, the number of officials and their families who came with the various ministries and commissions has greatly increased. Therefore, the population of Chongqing has recently increased to over 600,000. Since the enemy aircraft bombing on January 15 this year, evacuation has been vigorously carried out, but the floating population increases and decreases at any time, and it is not easy to achieve the effect of evacuation. Walking on the road, pedestrians rub shoulders, and the sidewalks are full of pedestrians. The narrower streets are simply like a theater after the show, and pedestrians have the difficulty of not being able to find a place to stand. Coupled with the complexity of transportation and the lack of public transportation, there are only rickshaws and sedan chairs as a means of transportation. Moreover, the roads are uneven, sometimes uphill and sometimes downhill, and private cars rush recklessly, so pedestrians have a "Sichuan Road is Difficult" sigh.

The weather in Chongqing is also extremely strange. For example, usually every day is in the thick fog of miasma, and the air pressure is extremely low, which simply makes people feel suffocated. However, it is precisely because of the clouds and fog covering the sky that it serves as a natural air defense barrier. Now it is already the middle of spring, and except for rain, there are days of high sky and clear air with the rising sun. Therefore, except for rainy days, many people take the old and the young to the south bank to avoid air raids every morning, so as to avoid the chaotic situation when the alarm sounds. The local people welcome sunny weather. However, the residents of Chongqing are not only bothered by the muddy roads on rainy days, making it difficult to walk, but also afraid of the threat of enemy aircraft coming on sunny days. It can be said that the people have a mixed feeling of gain and loss regarding the weather, which is truly an undesirable attitude.

The people of Chongqing include officials of all sizes in various government offices, executives of banks and companies, as well as employees of various levels in transportation agencies, public utilities, and private factories. There are also singers, dancers, prostitutes, and socialites who came upstream from Nanjing and Hankou. It can be said that there are many talented people, so theaters, cinemas, hotels, restaurants, tea houses, and cafes are crowded with people. Although the New Life Movement Committee stipulates that each banquet should not exceed eight yuan in national currency, in reality, the cost of a banquet is actually two or three times the price. It is truly said that the Tao is one foot high, and the devil is ten feet high. If we do not fundamentally find ways to eliminate the causes of extravagance, merely limiting the price of banquets will have the suspicion of encouraging corruption. On the one hand, we are restricting the evacuation of the population, and on the other hand, there are also a few who are making a fortune from the national crisis, indulging in singers, dancers, prostitutes, and socialites. In the future, we can only intensify the control of prices, increase the wartime excess profits tax, and thoroughly clean up officialdom, so that corruption is eliminated and those who enjoy excessive and undue profits due to the war of resistance will disappear from now on. Then, all kinds of intervention and suppression methods will naturally not have the phenomenon of outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant.

Chongqing is full of students from large, medium, and small schools. The schools in the city have changed their class hours to 8:00 to 10:00 in the morning and 4:00 to 6:00 or 7:00 in the afternoon. However, students may not all enter air raid shelters or go to distant places immediately after class. Then, why not concentrate teaching in the countryside farther away from the city, so as to avoid unnecessary sacrifices when enemy aircraft bomb the city in the future.

There are still more than ten newspapers in Chongqing. The sources of news all come from one source. In addition, the prices of paper and ink have skyrocketed, and most of them are printed on local paper. If two or three newspapers are left to publish twice a day and night as the main daily newspapers for reporting news in the city, the rest can be changed to be set up in various counties farther away from Chongqing. With the talents who have always been running the central newspapers, they can be distributed to various counties to develop local newspapers, and their effectiveness and achievements will definitely be more considerable than before. There is no need to crowd together, echo each other, and suffer from being at a loss.

What people in Chongqing are talking about, in addition to the news from the front and the future of the War of Resistance, is also the hope of the general public for the government to clean up officialdom. They always feel that there is still a need to reform the government aspect, so as to keep pace with the military. They also hope that the government will levy wartime excess profits taxes to stop hoarding and monopolies, so that the people who cannot be evacuated will be affected by the difficulties of life. Since the reporter has some knowledge, he is reporting to the responsible authorities incidentally.

### Italian Troops Occupy Albanian Capital, King and Queen Already Fled, Broadcast Before Departure to Defend Homeland

[Reuters, Rome, 8th] Italian troops invaded Tirana, the capital of Albania, at 8:30 this morning (Greenwich Mean Time). King Zog and key members of the Albanian government have already left Tirana for other destinations. The destination is believed to be or already have gone to Elbasan. The situation in Tirana tonight is extremely chaotic, with many armed rioters causing disturbances. The Italian embassy also encountered threats, but order was restored by the constabulary and the Italian military attache, and many rioters were arrested. Italian troops invaded Tirana from the port of Durazzo today and encountered brief resistance, as the Shijak Bridge between Tirana and Durazzo was automatically destroyed by Albanian constables. Italian troops also encountered resistance from Albanian guerrillas, but it is heard that the guerrillas have now returned to Tirana to surrender their weapons. An Italian military communique issued this morning stated that radio and telephone services in Tirana have been restored. Before Tirana was occupied by Italian troops, there was the possibility of a provisional government being organized by "responsible elements." These "responsible elements" will govern Albania based on just principles and under the jurisdiction of Italy.

[Associated Press, Rome, 7th] It is learned that since King Zog refused to make Albania a protectorate of Italy, Mussolini has dispatched more troops, warships, and aircraft to invade Albania. Italian officials claim that they can occupy all ports of Albania by noon today, capture Tirana, the capital, in the afternoon, and occupy the entire country within forty-eight hours. According to reports from Albania, Italian troops first landed at the port of Vlorë without encountering any resistance. It is also learned that Italy will control Albania's future foreign policy and be fully responsible for defending Albanian territory. The Italian occupation of Albania is expected to be extremely rapid, as the troops that have landed are all mechanized units and are assisted by seventy-nine three-engine bombers (which were used in the Spanish war). It is generally estimated that there are currently about 40,000 to 60,000 Italian troops in Albania.

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 8th] The Italian Ministry of Military Affairs issued a notice yesterday afternoon instructing reserve personnel from all infantry, cavalry, artillery, and engineering units to participate in all military operations this year.

[Reuters, Rome, 7th] A communique was issued here this afternoon stating that Santi Quaranta, Vlorë, Durazzo, and San Giovanni di Medua have been completely occupied by Italian troops. King Zog I of Albania had sent a delegation with full powers to meet with General Guzzoni and present conditions, which have been forwarded to Rome.

[Reuters, London, 7th] The Albanian Embassy in London announced at 1:30 PM today that Santi Quaranta, Durazzo, Vlorë, and other places had been seized by the aggressors after fierce fighting, but the constabulary and civilians will continue to defend the homeland.

[Reuters, London, 7th] This morning, 35,000 Italian troops attacked the Albanian coast and encountered strong resistance in the ports of Durazzo and San Giovanni di Medua. Italian aircraft flew all over Albania, distributing leaflets ordering Albanians not to resist, threatening them with "military violence," and stating that the Italian king could restore order in Albania. Italian vehicles, under the cover of naval gunfire, landed on Albanian soil. Albanians claim to have driven Italian troops out to sea twice in Durazzo. According to a report from Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, Albania has requested assistance from Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia has rejected the request because it has a treaty of friendship with Italy. At the same time, the Albanian shortwave radio station constantly broadcast in five languages, calling on Albanians to unite and resist the enemy, even to the last drop of blood. The Italian Embassy in London issued an official statement this afternoon stating that Italian troops are currently advancing inland, only having brief contact with irregular troops, and that Albanian troops are offering no resistance anywhere. Italian aircraft distributed leaflets stating that Italian troops would withdraw as soon as the disturbances that occurred yesterday were quelled, and that Italian aircraft had not bombed civilians. The Italian statement claiming that Albanian vehicles offered no resistance contradicts the statement issued by the Albanian Information Bureau this morning, which stated that the morale of the Albanian military and civilians was extremely high and that despite the disparity in military strength, they were able to fight bravely, preventing Italian troops from gaining a foothold on Albanian soil.

[Reuters, Yugoslav Capital, 7th] According to Albanian news, the government has telegraphed all representatives abroad, informing them of the Italian act of aggression. The notification denies the Italian claim that Italians in Albania were being mistreated and states that Durazzo and Medua have been completely destroyed by Italian air raids and shelling. The Albanian ambassador to Yugoslavia has informed the Yugoslav government of the incident, but the Yugoslav-Albanian treaty does not constitute a basis for Albania to request assistance from Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav government is currently in negotiations with the Italian government and hopes to seek a solution that prioritizes the interests of all three countries.

[Reuters, Yugoslav Capital, 7th] According to Albanian broadcasts received here today, there are a total of 170 Italian warships gathered off the Albanian coast, with 75 anchored off Santi Quaranta, 40 off Vlorë, 38 off Durazzo, 28 off San Giovanni di Medua, and about 10 off Bishti i Pallës. According to the aforementioned report, Italian warships shelled Durazzo four times, and Medua was completely destroyed by bombing. The Albanian broadcast called on the "magnanimous French" to not stand idly by as a small country with only a million people is wiped out.

[Reuters, Paris, 8th] According to a dispatch from Salonica, King Zog of Albania and his sister arrived in Vlorë today. The Albanian queen and her infant child are also there.

[Reuters, Athens, 7th] The Queen of Albania has fled into Greece with her young son to seek refuge.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 7th] King Zog of Albania broadcast a speech in Tirana today, stating, "The Albanian government is determined to defend the homeland with all its might. The spirit of resistance among the Albanian people is now extremely high."

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] The Albanian ambassador here held a meeting with Secretary of State Hull today. He said, "King Zog of Albania will vow to resist to the death and will never surrender. I would rather burn the archives of this embassy here than surrender to the Italians."

### British and French Governments Conduct Close Discussions, Watching the Future Situation in the Mediterranean, British Cabinet Also Held Meeting Yesterday

[Reuters, Rome, 7th] British Ambassador Sir Percy Loraine visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano today to inquire about the impact of the Albanian events on the Mediterranean status quo.

[Reuters, London, 7th] The news of the Italian invasion of Albania did not come as a complete surprise to the British side. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax received information sent to the Foreign Office today. The British and French governments have been conducting close discussions.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 7th] After the Albanian incident occurred, the French government was extremely active in diplomacy. Ambassador Corbin to the UK had talks with Sir Alexander Cadogan, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and then reported the developments to French Foreign Minister Bonnet by long-distance telephone.

[Reuters, Paris, 7th] French officials here are closely monitoring developments in the Albanian situation. While the general public is extremely concerned, judging from the situation, France may not be able to take new action. In principle, Britain and France had permitted Italy to have Albania as a protectorate, and Italy's actions in Albania today do not involve any significant implications for France. Although the Adriatic Sea will soon become an Italian lake after Italy occupies Albania, which seems to violate promises in principle, at the same time, if Italy has designs on Trieste, then German interests will also be threatened. However, no matter what, what is worried about is not the Albanian incident itself, but whether Italy's occupation of Albania is the launch of a joint Axis plan to invade the Mediterranean. If so, then the situation should be regarded as extremely serious. It is said that Italy's move was triggered by the successful conclusion of Polish Foreign Minister Beck's visit to the UK. If Mussolini's invasion is purely a show of taking face, then the Western powers should wait and see to determine whether Mussolini and Hitler are aware of the cooperation between Britain and France or are still determined to go their own way to achieve their goals.

[Reuters, London, 8th] 10 Downing Street will hold a cabinet meeting this morning to discuss the Albanian situation. Prime Minister Chamberlain is still on vacation in Scotland, so Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon will chair the meeting in his place. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and his colleagues will report on the Albanian situation in the last 24 hours.

[Reuters, London, 7th] Regarding the Albanian situation, the British official view is that a definite assessment can only be made after the entire situation has developed and the official reports have been carefully considered. Much of the information received in London today is contradictory and confusing. Other governments, such as Yugoslavia, are also experiencing similar difficulties in obtaining reliable information. However, the Italian government notified the British government on April 4 that it had no intention of changing Albania's existing status, and that it only intended to achieve close relations between Italy and Albania through legitimate diplomatic channels, based on the steps previously notified to Albania, without harming Albania's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax is currently staying in London in order to closely monitor the situation there. It is heard that other cabinet members are also on standby nearby. Today, visitors to the Foreign Office included the ambassadors of France and Turkey, the ministers of Romania, Greece, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria, and the Italian charge d'affaires.

### British Newspapers Comment on Italy's Violation of Agreements

[Reuters, London, 8th] The Manchester Guardian commented on the Italian invasion of Albania today, stating, "The German and Italian plan to control the Mediterranean has gradually been exposed. In any case, Italy must dominate the Mediterranean. Before General Franco achieved victory, Germany and Italy had already consolidated other positions in Spain. After the development of German and Italian power in Majorca, Spanish Morocco, and other Spanish ports, they are now seeking to seize hegemony in the Western Mediterranean. Germany is advancing southward, striving to seize political and economic power in Yugoslavia, while Italy is invading Albania. All this is preparing to create German and Italian superiority in the Eastern Mediterranean." After discussing the impact of the German and Italian "conquest" of Albania on Yugoslavia, Greece, and Romania, the newspaper said, "It is ridiculous to say that Italy's actions have not changed the situation in the Mediterranean. This is an act that violates the Anglo-Italian Agreement." The newspaper concluded, "The British government must pay attention to Mussolini's actions, just as it pays attention to Hitler's actions."

### US Attitude: Condemning the Untrustworthiness of Aggressor Nations, Will Not Recognize Italian Occupation of Albania

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] It is expected that the United States will not recognize Italy's occupation of Albania. Sources say that this Italian "aggression" has ended the illusion of being able to appease or buy off the Axis powers, and it is now clear that both sides of the Axis are aggressors and untrustworthy. Although Britain is currently organizing an anti-aggression group, much work remains to be done.

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] Secretary of State Hull had a long telephone conversation with President Roosevelt, who is staying at Warm Springs, discussing the Albanian events. The conversation involved the impact of this matter on US-Italian and US-Albanian relations.

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] Secretary of State Hull has received a telegram from the US minister to Albania stating that all US citizens in the area are currently at the US embassy and are all safe. Hull told reporters today that he does not believe there is significant American damage in the dangerous areas of Albania, so sending warships to Albania seems unnecessary. He also said that the US government is currently gathering important facts to determine its attitude towards the Italian-Albanian conflict.

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] The resistance of Albania to the Italian invasion has raised the question of whether the United States should prohibit the transport of weapons to Italy and Albania under the provisions of the Neutrality Act. There is much speculation here as to whether President Roosevelt will take this step to express his opposition to the Italian-Albanian war. The US government believes that the development of the Italian-Albanian war will not cause a European war, as Britain and France recognized Italy's special interests in Albania during the European War.

### Reports of British Navy Landing on the East Coast of Greece

[Haitong News Agency, Rome, 8th] It has been reported that the British Navy has occupied various islands off the east coast of Greece. As of noon, there is still no confirmed news. It is heard that two teams of the British Mediterranean Fleet were off the coast of various islands on Friday.

### German Accomplice Attempts to Defend Aggression: Japan Discusses European Situation

[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] The German Foreign Ministry held a meeting, seemingly to discuss Italy's actions in Albania. Foreign diplomatic circles suggest that this action by Italy is related to recent negotiations between the German and Italian general staffs, and believe that Italy's actions would not have been possible without Hitler's approval.

[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] German officials stated, "Western democracies have no sphere of influence in Albania. Any misguided intervention by them in the legitimate and unassailable position and actions of our Axis partners will not be understood or tolerated by Germany."

[Reuters, Rome, 7th] An Italian spokesman, Gaviglioli, in an article in "Italian Newspaper," declared that Italy has completed a new achievement in the Near East and Europe. He stated that in response to the appeals of Albanian patriots unwilling to endure the oppressive rule of King Zog, and to protect the lives and property of Italian residents in Albania, Italy has today launched an expedition into Albania with irresistible force and has occupied many key points. Several days ago, King Zog requested Italy for new loans, assistance, and guarantees, and asked Italian troops to enter certain areas of Albania. However, the government ultimately discovered that King Zog's need for Italian troops was merely a conspiracy to commit aggression against Yugoslavia. The purpose of this conspiracy was to provoke animosity between Italy and Yugoslavia. Italy was not deceived, and King Zog and his officials became enraged and even violated Italian residents. The Italian government urged King Zog to take responsibility and pay attention, but King Zog ignored them and instead intensified the situation. Italy's righteous expedition has restored peace, order, and freedom to Albania. Neighboring countries need not be alarmed, as Italy only wishes to cooperate amicably with all its neighbors and guarantee peace in the Balkans and Europe.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 8th] Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Navy Minister Yonai held a meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM to discuss the European situation after Germany and Italy's actions and to exchange opinions.

### Albanian Crown to be Given to Italy by Germany

[Associated Press, Vienna, 7th] As Albania has become a part of the Italian Empire, Hitler may present the Italian King with the Albanian crown of historical value. This crown is a leather helmet that once belonged to the former Albanian King, Shahada Beg, and is currently housed in the Vienna Museum. It is said that King Zog has requested the return of this crown several times over the years, but without success.

### Netherlands on Alert: Romanian Foreign Minister to Turkey to Discuss British and French Support

[Reuters, The Hague, 8th] The Dutch government is currently considering the international situation following Italy's invasion of Albania and has taken steps to protect its coast and borders. Some reservists have also been ordered to be prepared.

[Reuters, Bucharest, 7th] Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu, after several hours of private discussions with Prime Minister Calinescu this afternoon, is scheduled to depart for Istanbul tonight. It is generally speculated that Gafencu will meet with Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu to discuss the Albanian war and the situation in the Balkans.

[Associated Press, Bucharest, 7th] It is learned that the Romanian Foreign Minister will board a Romanian warship tonight and pass through Istanbul. It is reported that his mission is to discuss with the Turkish government the permission for British and French warships to pass through the Dardanelles Strait to assist Romania in the event of threats or aggression.

[Associated Press, Bucharest, 7th] Officials here told the Associated Press that Romania has not yet decided on its attitude towards Italy's invasion of Albania but is closely monitoring the developments. Furthermore, relations between Vienna and Hungary remain tense, so Romanian troops along the Hungarian border have not yet been disbanded.

[Associated Press, Yugoslavian Capital, 8th] Officials here are maintaining strict silence regarding the Albanian incident.

### Franco Government Joins Anti-Comintern Pact

[Reuters, Burgos, 7th] The Spanish Franco government today announced its accession to the Anti-Comintern Pact, declaring that this move is to strengthen the government's resistance in a dangerous environment. The agreement was signed in Burgos by the Spanish Foreign Minister, with the German and Italian ambassadors and the Japanese Minister participating.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 7th] Political figures here discussed after the Spanish Nationalist government joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, stating that this action is another demonstration of the strength of "countries that maintain order." This action is noteworthy as it coincides with Germany's conquest of Czechoslovakia and the recovery of Memel, Japan's occupation of the Spratly Islands, and Italy's invasion of Albania. After Spain joins the Anti-Comintern Pact, the offensive adopted by poor countries towards rich countries will inevitably be strengthened.

### American Gas Masks Shipped to Europe: Ames Urges Government to Study Aircraft Manufacturing

[Associated Press, Washington, 7th] It has been learned that the U.S. State Department has shipped 1,550 gas masks to the embassies and legations of various countries in Europe, so that embassy staff can use them in the event of a European war.

[Reuters, Washington, 7th] Ames, Chairman of the U.S. National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, told the Senate Appropriations Committee today that "While we are displeased, the United States is indeed second to Germany in excellent aircraft." Ames believes that the excellence of German aircraft relies on the advancement of aeronautical research, so he strongly urged the government to allocate $1,140,000 for the research of aircraft manufacturing.

### Germany to Exert New Pressure on Poland: Britain to Accelerate Anti-Aggression Efforts, Has Begun Talks with Romania

[Associated Press, Paris, 7th] Local radio stations reported that there are significant military movements in Pomerania and Silesia, leading people to believe that Germany will exert new pressure on Poland after Colonel Beck returns home. Also, French Foreign Minister Bonnet met with the Yugoslavian Ambassador to France tonight.

[Associated Press, London, 7th] It is believed here that Italy's invasion of Albania and the Axis countries' attitude towards Poland's joining the British and French "Stop Hitler" coalition are indications that British Prime Minister Chamberlain has (1) begun negotiations with Romania to have them join the anti-Hitler group and (2) indicated to Hungary that if Hungary agrees to resist German invasion, Britain may offer Hungary an independence guarantee. The Romanian Foreign Minister, carrying King Carol's instructions, has begun discussing Romania's joining the "Stop Hitler" group. Polish Foreign Minister Beck has also advised Chamberlain to invite Hungary to join the group, saying that Hungarian Regent Horthy will not allow Hitler, and that Hungary is willing to help Austria.

[Reuters, London, 7th] Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck set off to return to Warsaw today after completing the Anglo-Polish mutual assistance agreement.

### Page Succeeds as Australian Prime Minister: New Cabinet Formed

[Reuters, Australian Capital, 7th] Australian Minister for Commerce Page has been appointed as Prime Minister to succeed the late Prime Minister Lyons. He has formed a new cabinet, with little internal change, mostly because the new cabinet is a temporary expedient.

Brief Commentary

### Another Act in the European War of Aggression!

Italian troops launch a large-scale invasion of Albania!

Mobilizing over 20,000 troops and 400 aircraft!

Under the fire of aircraft and artillery, key Albanian ports have fallen!

The tragedy of a small country, the shame of mankind, another act in the European war of aggression! What else can we say here?

First, we admire Albania's nationwide anti-aggression sentiment and determination to shed the last drop of blood. Albania's current situation is extremely difficult. The aggressors are determined to conquer, neighboring countries Yugoslavia and Greece are standing by, and Britain and France are silent! However, Albania would rather be shattered like jade than surrender. If this spirit can be maintained to the end, even if today's suffering is unavoidable, it will surely lay the foundation for a truly independent future.

Second, we mourn for small countries such as Yugoslavia. If Albania is destroyed, then Yugoslavia, Romania, Greece, Bulgaria, and even Turkey will be subject to the dictates of the German and Italian aggressors.

Third, we are even more saddened by Britain and France. According to last night's news reports, "British officials remain silent" and "France will not take action," as if they had a tacit agreement with Italy. In fact, this action by Italy is clearly the first step in a further conquest plan by Germany and Italy. Not only will the aggressors' iron heels soon drive into Britain and France after several small countries have been sacrificed, but Germany is already actively preparing to advance westward, and France itself will immediately become the front line!

Finally, we must recognize that if democratic countries, especially Britain and France, immediately and thoroughly abandon their non-intervention policy, immediately abandon their hypocritical policy of opposing aggression while leaving room for aggression, immediately announce a thorough anti-aggression foreign policy, and strengthen the unity of the Soviet Union, the United States, and small democratic countries in Europe, taking active steps to sanction aggressors, then the European situation can still be saved.

### Rectifying Security in Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia

A Chongqing dispatch on the 7th stated that Sha Wangduerzhapu, the commissioner of the Suiyuan Mongol Political Council, has repeatedly met with central authorities in Chongqing to discuss the improvement of Suiyuan Mongol political affairs and has reached a concrete decision. The central government will soon rectify security in Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia and organize and train strong men of all ethnic groups. This work should have been completed long ago during the war preparation period. The fact that this plan is only being made today is regrettable. However, from this fact, on the one hand, we can see the hatred of the Suiyuan Mongol people towards the Japanese and their warm support for the central government, and on the other hand, we can see the central government's emphasis on the interests of the Suiyuan Mongol people. We know that in this new stage of the war of resistance, the focus of the Japanese invasion plan is on the Northwest and Southwest strategy, and before and during their large-scale military operations, they will intensify the use of false "ethnic policies" to divide the ethnic minorities of our country. Although this poisonous strategy has gradually been seen through by the public in Suiyuan, Chahar, and other places, we cannot ignore their ever-changing activities. The fact that the central government is able to effectively rectify security in Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia and organize and train Suiyuan Mongol strong men today is a major blow to the Japanese poisonous strategy. However, those engaged in this work must have a clear understanding of national revolution and strong determination, and be highly respected among the Suiyuan Mongol people. They must also educate, organize, and train the Suiyuan Mongol people with a truly equal attitude in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People's ethnic policy, and at the same time effectively help them solve all practical problems, unleash their initiative and enthusiasm to fight for liberation and freedom, and consolidate and expand the national united front, contributing all their efforts, strength, and resources to strive for the final victory of the Chinese national revolution. In addition, the scope of this work should also be extended from Suiyuan to various ethnic minorities in the Northwest and Southwest regions.

### A Glimpse of Albania (Continued and Completed)

— Dong Ping

Three

The people of Albania are mostly Albanians, with a small number of Kurds in the east. There are many dialects in the country, there is no unified writing system, and the cultural level is extremely low. The textbooks in schools have to be written by themselves temporarily.

The mountain people are brave, warlike, and hardworking. They are also extremely hospitable. Regardless of whether you are familiar or not, you will be warmly welcomed when passing through their villages, and they will not accept any money. If you stay overnight and try to pay, they will consider it an insult.

The people living on the plains are completely different. They are lazy, cunning, stingy, and cowardly, and spend their days doing nothing. Their greatest hobby is spending the day in the barber shop, indulging in the three-step process of shaving, scraping, and trimming as the greatest pleasure in the world.

Albania does not have a specific religion. About two-thirds of the people believe in Islam, and one-third believe in Christianity. King Zog himself is a Muslim, but since his marriage to Countess Geraldine Apponyi de Nagy-Appony on April 27 last year, he has abandoned Islam and greatly respected Roman Catholicism because the countess is a Roman Catholic.

His wedding day, April 27, is a historically significant day. Five hundred years ago, Skanderbeg, the leader of the Albanians, also got married on this day. Skanderbeg is considered a great figure in Albania. Even today, many Albanian ladies wear black tops to mourn him!

Four

Speaking of Albanian customs and habits, they are simply bizarre. For example, if you offer an Albanian a cigarette, if he is a smoker, he will shake his head and reach out to take it. If he does not smoke, he will nod his head and politely decline. Does this nodding and shaking of the head confuse you? There are many things like this in Albania.

Gambling is supposedly prohibited in Albania. However, during religious holidays, the gambling ban is lifted, and the most frugal residents of the mountainous areas also rush to the villages to gamble their life savings on a single throw of the dice.

The strangest thing is Albania's preference for sons over daughters. Traditionally, women were considered worthless. There are currently only two so-called girls' schools in the country, and naturally, they have to copy their own textbooks. They are run by foreign women because Albanians believe that no Albanian woman is qualified to run an education. If an Albanian woman wants to open a school, no one will care, and it will be shut down.

King Zog has ordered the prohibition of women wearing veils, but Muslims are still not allowed to show their legs. Therefore, many girls wear black stockings and large outer shirts while playing basketball in the sun.

Five

Although Albania and Italy signed an agreement in 1937, in which Italy lent several million to Albania to develop everything in the country, the transportation and public works in Albania are still very backward today.

Albania has no railways, no radio stations, and not even running water. Every drop of water is drawn from wells dug by themselves. Ordinary transportation is by slow oxcarts, and occasionally, new-style cars speed on muddy roads.

You can make phone calls and send submarine telegraphs to every country in Europe from London, but Albania is not included. It cannot be connected to any country. The telephones in its own country are also the simplest in the world. You can pick up the phone and immediately ask to speak to Mr. So-and-so, and the operator will immediately connect you to that family without any mistakes. Are you surprised? No need to be, because there are only two operators and a handful of telephone subscribers. They have long memorized them.

Although the capital of Albania, Tirana, seems important, there are only two bustling streets, the government agencies, parliament buildings, and foreign embassies are very simple. The only things that can be considered luxurious are a few dilapidated hotels and two cinemas.

Albania has no film censorship, so any film can be shown. Albanians, who have never seen the world, all come here to enjoy it.

Durazzo, bordering the coast, is a harbor of natural beauty, but it is always empty. Albania has no navy or merchant ships. Therefore, Mussolini has set his sights on this place.

Six

Albanian King Zog, who changed from president to king, is still well-regarded by the people, but his confidant, Kloshi, is extremely unpopular and has been assassinated countless times. He now lives in the Ksel Gardens, guarded by many fierce bodyguards. The people are constantly cursing him. His friends have all been promoted and made a fortune, and his enemies are all dead. Every day, in tea houses and taverns, you can hear people ranting about his history of crimes.

King Zog himself has three brothers and six sisters, but only three sisters remain in the country. The others dare not return because they are afraid of being assassinated. However, these three sisters are free and unrestrained and do not care at all. Because, you must remember, Albanians believe that women are not worth wasting bullets on.

They also have female soldiers, all enjoying gorgeous uniforms. A year ago, they went to the United States to buy fashionable items. Naturally, they could not be bought in Tirana. They took the Royal Steamer home, bringing back ninety pairs of shoes.

King Zog is trying his best to promote thrift, but in fact, it has little effect. Corruption remains rampant. A young cabinet member said, "The King's own sisters are setting such an example, how can we expect the people to be thrifty? Six spending women will really bankrupt our small country!"

### Hong Kong Authorities Prepare to Requisition Ships to Evacuate Residents in the Event of War: Civil Defence Actively Plans Various Evacuation Schemes: Bomb Shelters Built in Many New Buildings in Hong Kong and Kowloon

With the crisis of World War II imminent, the Hong Kong authorities are not only actively strengthening military defense equipment but also paying particular attention to preparations for air raid defense. Since the arrival of Civil Defence Commissioner Stewart Blofeld Perkins, he has spared no effort in planning various civil defence tasks. Recognizing that civil defence work must be carried out in close cooperation with residents in order to achieve good results, the government is taking steps to implement this cooperation, such as establishing civil defence training courses in various districts and expanding civil defence propaganda to instill civil defence knowledge in residents. After several months of effort, considerable progress has been made in various tasks, and Hong Kong's air defence capabilities are also increasing daily.

Actively Carrying Out Population Evacuation

According to reporters, the civil defence authorities are currently actively carrying out population evacuation work. The authorities recognize that densely populated urban areas are easy targets for enemy air raids, so they should plan evacuation methods in advance. The civil defence authorities have commissioned a small committee to be responsible for planning this. The first step is to conduct a census of the population density in all districts of Hong Kong. Significant results have been achieved, confirming that the most densely populated housing areas are Central, Wan Chai, Sai Ying Pun in Hong Kong and Yau Ma Tei and Mong Kok in Kowloon, which should be evacuated first. As for evacuation methods, suitable locations are being surveyed in the New Territories, Kowloon, and Lantau Island to build civil defence tents to accommodate residents when evacuation is implemented in the event of war.

Considering the Use of Ships in the Port

The above is one of various evacuation methods. In addition, the committee is constantly considering methods, and the civil defence committee has recently received a suggestion from a certain party to mobilize large and small ships parked in the port in the event of a sudden war to transport residents for evacuation, in order to avoid the threat of air raids. This method can provide considerable assistance in evacuating residents, but it must be fully prepared, and the evacuation must be carried out quickly in order to be effective. The civil defence committee has considered this suggestion and is conducting a detailed study to see if it is feasible. If the results of the study are deemed feasible, the committee will draft a detailed plan for implementation. If necessary, the Hong Kong government will consult with ships parked in the port to transport Hong Kong residents for evacuation.

Bomb Shelters Built in Hong Kong and Kowloon Buildings

As for the residents of Hong Kong, they now have a deep understanding of the importance of civil defence work and can cooperate with the government to automatically make various civil defence arrangements. Recently, residents of buildings in Kowloon Tong and Ho Man Tin and other districts have negotiated with landlords to add bomb shelters or trenches to each building, and new buildings are also mostly built with bomb shelters. If all new-style Western-style buildings in Hong Kong and Kowloon can be built with bomb shelters or trenches, even if war breaks out and Hong Kong is subjected to air raids, the lives of residents can be guaranteed. In addition, the civil defence authorities have now added a civil defence siren to Sheung Wan Market. The siren was tested yesterday afternoon at 2:10 PM, sounding twice for about ten minutes, with excellent results. The sound traveled far and wide, reaching areas such as the Marine Department and the YMCA pier in Sai Wan.

### Children's Handicraft Training Institute Achieves Extremely Satisfactory Results in Three-Month Trial: Children's Welfare Association Decides to Take Over Direct Management in the Future

The Hong Kong branch of the China Wartime Children's Welfare Association, in order to implement life education and cultivate children's handicraft skills, has specially established a children's handicraft training institute attached to the Second Branch (National Hospital) to implement various handicraft teachings. Hospital Director Ho Ailing obtained personal donations from enthusiastic overseas Chinese Xu Rangcheng to establish the institute, and Mr. Xu agreed to serve as the director of the institute. The institute was opened in January this year, with a three-month trial period planned. If good results can be obtained after the expiration of the period, the Welfare Association will continue to operate it. The institute was opened on January 9. As of yesterday, the three-month trial period has ended. During these three months, the number of students has increased steadily. The children's interest in learning handicrafts such as woodworking, paper flower making, and cloth work has become increasingly strong. The satisfaction of the results exceeded expectations. The institute's products began to be sold in major department stores in Hong Kong a month ago. Mr. Xu, believing that the predetermined plan had been implemented and achieved satisfactory results, and in order to expand development in the future, should be handed over to the Welfare Association for direct management. He immediately consulted with Hospital Director Ho Ailing and agreed to hand it back to the Welfare Association from yesterday. The handover was held at the hospital address at 4:00 PM yesterday. The institute's products, such as wooden toys and paper flowers, excluding those that have been sold, still had more than 230 pieces, and more than 60,000 paper flowers, along with furniture, utensils, and other items, totaling several hundred pieces. All of them were sent out by Mr. Xu and personally received by Hospital Director Ho, and they gave a speech to the children, encouraging them to continue their efforts to learn crafts in the future.

### Central Government Sends Personnel to Verify Fishermen's Shipwreck: Avoid Unscrupulous People from Reporting Abuse: Stop Ambition to Misappropriate Relief Funds

Recently, shipwrecks of fishing boats have occurred once or twice a week. The general public has doubts, thinking that it may be because the central government has agreed to allocate huge sums of money to help the disaster-stricken fishermen in Hong Kong, which will be distributed by the representative of the Central Relief Committee stationed in Hong Kong. This has led some unscrupulous people among the fishermen to covet this relief fund and deliberately exaggerate their words in order to achieve their deceptive plans. It is heard that the central government has also faintly heard of the frequent occurrence of fishing boat disasters and cannot tolerate the untruths. Therefore, they are immediately investigating the details and reporting them to them for verification.

### Members of the Literary Association Staying in Hong Kong Hold Fellowship Meeting Yesterday: Will be Divided into Four Groups to Study Literary Work

The Hong Kong office of the Literary Association held a fellowship meeting for members staying in Hong Kong at the Lee Garden yesterday at 2:00 PM. The venue was elegant and the air was fresh. The bamboo fence had a unique style. Those attending on that day were all well-known literary figures, such as Xu Dishan, Chen Hengzhe, Ouyang Yuqian, Dai Wangshu, Yan Jicheng and his wife, Ye Lingfeng, Jin Zenghu, Ye Qiuyuan, and Lou Shiyi. After tea, they held a group photo, and then Ms. Chen Hengzhe reported on the method of dividing into groups to study literary work, including magazine literature, art literature, Western literature, and film drama. Each group will also appoint Lu Danlin, Lou Shiyi, Ouyang Yuqian, and Xu Dishan to convene on a regular basis. Every Friday is a research period for a certain group. At that time, the conveners will separately notify the group members to join a certain group according to their research interests. Then Lou Shiyi reported on the submission and publication methods of the Editorial Committee. The meeting was dismissed at about 5:00 PM.

### The Chinese University Service Corps Hosted Representatives from All Sectors Yesterday; The Dongjiang Task Force Will Soon Depart

The Chinese University Northward War Zone Service Corps held a tea party at the St. Seta Hotel yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to host representatives from various social groups and the press. They reported on the corps' work over the past year and announced the imminent departure of the Dongjiang Task Force. The hosts included Ms. Liang Dinghui, Feng Boheng, and Fang Shaoyi, while the guests included over fifty people, including Mr. Liu Haiping, representing Chairman Xu Shiying. Ms. Liang Dinghui gave a welcoming speech, stating that the corps was established after the outbreak of the war of resistance and has been active for over a year. Last February, a team was formed to serve in the war zones to the north. Now that the members have returned south, they have reviewed the work of the past year and compiled it into a volume to present to those who are enthusiastic about society. Currently, the corps has formed the Dongjiang Task Force due to the outbreak of the war in Dongjiang. It was originally scheduled to depart on the 10th of this month, but the preparations have been delayed and will be completed soon. She hoped everyone would provide guidance. Feng Boheng then reported on the corps' work in various battlefields over the past year, briefly describing the situations they had experienced in the past twelve months, stating that the corps has always focused on connecting the front and rear, and has adhered to this principle for over a year. Representatives of Chairman Xu and guests then delivered speeches, expressing deep appreciation.

### All Ships' Radio Stations Must Modify Spark Transmitters; Those with Power Over Three Kilowatts Cannot Be Used After January Next Year

According to a notice published in the Hong Kong Government Gazette yesterday morning, from January 1st of next year, all spark transmitters currently installed on ships' radio stations with a power of three kilowatts or more will be prohibited from continued use. Therefore, all relevant ships should make the necessary modifications by the end of this year in accordance with the new radio traffic regulations. Otherwise, the responsible authorities will not issue passenger transport permits or safety radio certificates, meaning that these ocean-going ships will not be able to go to sea. Spark transmitters easily interfere with modern four-stroke transmitters, which have a fixed frequency and do not disturb nearby or distant frequencies. This is why they are used for radio broadcasting. In addition, four-stroke transmitters can broadcast more widely and can use short or extra-short waves. Spark transmitters cannot use waves below 200 meters. For these reasons, the International Radiotelegraph Conference held in Washington in 1930 stipulated that all ships should install the above-mentioned new equipment before 1940. This decision has not yet been implemented by hundreds of ships currently docking in Hong Kong, including those sailing along the coast of China, especially passenger merchant ships registered in Hong Kong, which rarely comply with the new regulations to install new transmitters.

### Another American in Hong Kong Builds a Sailboat to Ship to America, Carrying Special Chinese Goods to Participate in the Golden Gate Exhibition

Recently, an American built a sailboat named "Sea Dragon" in Hong Kong, intending to cross the Pacific Ocean to participate in the Golden Gate Exhibition in San Francisco. However, after reaching Midway Island, it disappeared without a trace, suspected of being lost in a storm. This has already been reported in the newspapers. According to investigations by reporters, another American, Mr. Chandler, formerly of the Da Lai Company, is currently building a sailboat at a shipyard in Aberdeen. It will soon be completed and shipped to America to participate in the Golden Gate Exhibition. If it is too late, after the ship arrives in America, it will transport special Chinese goods, such as antiques, porcelain, camphor wood trunks, and Chinese tea, to various places for sale, hoping to attract the curiosity of people there with the appeal of a Chinese sailboat. Currently, Mr. Chandler has hired Feng Ji, a former crew member of a President Liner ship, as an assistant to travel to America together. The sailboat will be named "Wanli" (Ten Thousand Miles) to signify a bright future.

### Expediting Emergency Relief; Two Representatives from Xinhui Went to Macau Yesterday; Investigating Transportation Routes from Macau to the Mainland; Will First Provide Relief to Refugees in Wan Chai, Macau

After the outbreak of war in Jiangmen Huicheng, tens of thousands of local compatriots fled to Macau through various routes. Since receiving 8,000 yuan from the Central Relief Commission, the Xinhui Association here has immediately started work, purchasing a large amount of rice and medicine. To assess the disaster situation and investigate transportation routes, Liu Yuyun and Zhang Lanzhou, two representatives, were specially sent to Macau yesterday morning to investigate the transportation routes between Xinhui and Macau, so as to transport rice for relief. They will first provide relief to the refugees living in the open in Wan Chai, across the sea from Macau, within the next ten days. Furthermore, according to someone who came to Hong Kong from Taishan yesterday, there are still small waterways between Sanbu and Macau that can be used. However, according to their information, these small waterways are already within the war zone, and it is questionable whether they can be maintained for long. According to Mr. Ou Ziqi, the head of the Xinhui Chamber of Commerce, the electric boat traffic between Sanbu and Macau used to take the route from Sanjiang Mu through Aoyu Sha to Qianshan. It did not stop after the outbreak of the war in Jiangmen, but there were military police guarding along the way, making passage difficult. Therefore, the association first sent Mr. Zhang Lanzhou to Macau, also to ask the Zhongshan County authorities to provide protection along the way, so that relief supplies could be transported in. If protection for the transport of relief supplies is guaranteed, four or five hundred thousand dan of rice should not be a problem.

### Construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway is being Accelerated; Central Government Stored Sleepers in Hong Kong Being Transported to Yunnan and Burma; Ten Giant Lighters Will Be Leased to Transport to Burma and then Yunnan; 120,000 Workers on the Entire Line; Expected to Open to Traffic in the Autumn

Before the interruption of transportation between Hong Kong and Guangzhou, all goods ordered by our central government from European and American countries were transferred through Hong Kong. No matter what kind of goods were imported into China, they were transported to Hong Kong by ship and stored, and then transferred to various parts of the country in batches. Therefore, since the changes in the situation in South China, the central government has stored a large number of goods in Hong Kong that could not be transferred, with railway sleepers alone numbering in the millions, piled up in the open spaces of Seven Sisters and the Peninsula, resembling buildings. However, these sleepers were purchased in advance to supply the needs of various railway trunk lines in the southwest of the country. At present, the construction of various trunk lines is in full swing, and the need for these sleepers is extremely urgent. It is impossible to allow them to remain in Hong Kong for a long time, affecting the construction of transportation in the southwest. In particular, the advancement of the Yunnan-Burma Railway trunk line project is particularly urgent. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications of the Central Government, in order to meet the current needs and enhance the efficiency of the Yunnan-Burma Railway project, telegraphed personnel of the Hong Kong transportation agency yesterday, ordering them to quickly find ways to move the stored sleepers to Yangon and transfer them to the main stations of the Yunnan-Burma Railway. After receiving the order, the person in charge of the agency contacted a lighter company yesterday to lease a large number of lighters to transport all the sleepers stored in Hong Kong to Yangon. It was found that a Panama ship had been leased a month ago to transport several batches of sleepers to Yangon, but it was suspended due to an incident. Now, due to urgent needs, the Ministry has ordered a rapid turnaround and had no choice but to lease giant lighters to undertake transportation. According to a person in the agency, it is estimated that it will take three or four months for ten lighters to complete the transfer. As for the Yunnan-Burma Railway project, it is now being accelerated. The number of British technical experts responsible for guiding the project has increased to more than 270, and the total number of men and women working on the line has increased to more than 120,000, working in shifts day and night. It is expected that the construction of all sections of the line can be completed successively in the short term, and the railway can be officially opened to traffic this autumn.

### Hong Kong Movie Star Chen Yunshang Returned to Hong Kong from Shanghai Yesterday

Chinese movie star Ms. Chen Yunshang's reputation soared after starring in "Mulan Joins the Army" and "Fairy Yunshang" in the north, causing a nationwide sensation. She returned south yesterday on the Canadian Empress ship, arriving in Hong Kong at 8:30 yesterday morning. Relatives and friends welcomed her enthusiastically. Dozens of people from the film industry, such as Luo Mingyou, Zhu Qingxian, and Zhao Shushen, also came to welcome her. Ms. Chen briefly spoke with reporters, saying that this return south was to fulfill an old contract and that she would have to travel north again in June or July to continue working for Xinhua Company. She had a very good impression of Shanghai. Although people in Shanghai are in a special environment, they still spare no effort in patriotic movements and welcome national films with national consciousness. The sensation caused by "Mulan Joins the Army" was due to this. The grand welcome party planned by the Hong Kong film industry has been canceled because Ms. Chen believes that the national crisis is at hand and refused to attend.

### The Current Affairs Symposium Held by the Young Journalists Association

— Luo Xia

The Current International Situation and Our Tasks

In order to study journalism, conduct collective self-education, and actively enrich the news front, the Hong Kong branch of the Young Journalists Association held its first symposium the other day. The topic of discussion was "The Current International Situation and Our Tasks." Dozens of people attended the discussion, and everyone expressed their opinions freely, making the symposium an exceptionally successful one.

It was a gloomy afternoon. The weather was cold, and the biting wind was blowing. The meeting was originally scheduled to start at 2:30, but several people had already registered by 2:30. Then came reporters from various newspapers, and editors from various newspapers. Many were long-lost friends, or even new members. It was inevitable that they would shake hands, exchange greetings, and talk and laugh heartily. The spirit of cooperation filled the venue. After a while, the director of the learning department appeared with a smile, inviting everyone to take their seats. Then, he briefly explained the topic of discussion, and then invited Mr. Luo Yinpu to first give a simple report on the issue of the anti-aggression front in the face of the dramatic changes in the European situation.

Mr. Luo moved his chair and ran to the center of the venue. He said in a firm tone, "After the fall of Czechoslovakia, Germany still thoroughly implemented its plan of aggression. This result prompted fear in England. On the one hand, it concluded an agreement with Poland, and on the other hand, it wooed Italy, thinking of breaking up the German-Italian axis and forming a large encirclement of Germany. However, the success rate of this hope is very low. Due to the urgency of the situation, England finally took the path of the anti-aggression front." A burst of enthusiastic applause sent him back to his seat.

Then came another round of applause as Mr. Jin Zhonghua stood up. He analyzed in detail the impact of the European situation on the Far East. He reported very gently, "Germany's aggressive actions in Europe have given Japan an opportunity to engage in crazy activities in the Far East. It first occupied Hainan Island and continued to annex the Bali Islands. This aggressive behavior is, of course, a great stimulus to the United States. Its future policy towards the East will, of course, be to further assist China. Moreover, not only the United States, but also countries such as Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, will step up their assistance to us because of their interests in the Far East. Therefore, the formation of an anti-aggression front in the Far East is very likely. Judging from the current international situation, it is undoubtedly beneficial to us." After speaking, he slowly sat down, and a comrade sitting behind him offered him a cigarette as a sign of comfort.

In the hazy atmosphere of light blue smoke, they entered the third topic: "The diplomatic policy that our country should adopt at present." Only then did the symposium begin. Liu Simu stood up again with a smile and said, "The current international situation is favorable to us. This is undeniable. However, on the one hand, the pro-peace argument is very rampant. Recently, Wang Jingwei colluded with × Fang, ×××××. From these points of view, we have obtained a concrete basis for discussion. That is to say, we should now discuss whether we should choose the path of peace or war. There is nothing to say about advocating peace. Will the war be suppressed by external forces, and how should we take diplomatic measures to win a more favorable position in the international community for our war of resistance?"

As soon as he finished speaking, Mr. Guo Butao, the oldest person present, resolutely said, "There will always be external mediation pressure, but the key to peace or war is in our hands. If we work hard to resist the war, external pressure will never subdue us. We should intensify our war of resistance!" The whole audience cheered and applauded enthusiastically.

Following this, Mr. Pan Lang explained this issue in detail, and Mr. Wang Jiyuan also expressed his opinions on our diplomatic policy. However, he believed that we should further unite with the Soviet Union at this time in order to obtain further assistance from the Soviet Union. Jin Zhonghua believed that our current diplomatic policy should not be biased towards one side. Tan Siwen also elaborated on this issue, and the conclusion was: "On the one hand, we must obtain more assistance from the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, we must actively unite with Britain, France, and the United States."

The topic of the discussion turned to the fourth one: "What should the news media pay attention to at present?" Mr. Tan Siwen first put forward their experience. He believed that the editors should pay attention to the fact that rumors about mediating the Sino-Japanese War and other peaceful atmospheres should be interpreted as much as possible to explain the possibility of this matter, and there is no need to exaggerate the headlines of this news!"

Hua Simu took out a manuscript from Mr. Xia Yan's gift and read it out in public, enriching the topic of discussion. The meaning of this manuscript is: "He saw the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life for the national oath of office from Guilin all the way to Hong Kong. He unexpectedly came to Hong Kong and also saw thousands of young people enthusiastically take the oath of office, but at the same time, the remarks of traitors were extremely rampant. At the same time, various newspapers also published advertisements for Zeng Zhongming's country, and at the same time, he pointed out that several newspapers in Hong Kong had already been ×ed by pro-peace elements ××, and actively spread poison to our overseas Chinese. Therefore, all of us newspapers with serious attitudes should unite and enrich ourselves to fight the ×× traitorous newspapers. Finally, he proposed that all the outstanding young journalists in Hong Kong should immediately hold a large gathering to take the national oath of office. He also added two articles on the news media after the convention. This proposal was enthusiastically approved, and a method of raising the national oath of office was immediately decided upon. Finally, everyone put forward the report that among the Zeng You of the Society, there were already several members who said that they had left these ×× newspapers and moved to other places to make a living. This is the attitude that the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation should have, and this is the glory of young journalists.

### A Discussion on Historical Films

— Jie Ru

In today's Chinese film field, there is a popular trend, that is, the production of "historical films."

"Historical film" is a film with a historical theme. Since "Diao Chan" and "Mulan Joins the Army" and other historical costume films have achieved great box office records, "historical film" has established its transcendent position in the field of Chinese films, forming a new trend. A large number of audiences have a strong interest in the emerging "historical films;" and general film producers are also reluctant to easily let go of this "business opportunity," and are enthusiastically carrying out and planning to produce "historical films." Thus, historical films have caused considerable fluctuations in today's Chinese film industry.

Today's Chinese reality needs to re-estimate all past history, because today's China is on the verge of an epoch-making historical change. The flames of national revolutionary war are surging on the vast land of China. In the face of this rapid historical change, it is necessary to re-evaluate the past history. Therefore, the historical film that gives history a re-expression and re-estimation in an artistic image has gained its realistic foundation. But the main reason is that today's Chinese film market is restricted by various conditions, the domestic market is completely stagnant, and the overseas market is controlled by foreigners, unable to clearly reflect the reality of today's war of resistance, and unable to express its attitude towards the current historical change, so it can only draw on past historical themes for expression, so that the audience can see the reality of today from the perspective of past history, and look forward to the future of today's history from the development of past history.

Historical film is not a refuge from reality, but only a cloak of reality. Within this cloak, there is still a reflection of objective reality. The creators of historical films should make it connect with the development law of the historical process from the development of those historical themes, and through the association of this historical development law, the truth of objective reality can be embodied in the historical film. Although the historical film depicts the truth of past history, it has a clear connection with the truth of today's reality. As long as it can vividly depict this connection, the audience can perceive the truth of the current reality from the historical film, so that the historical film can properly perform its combat mission under the special circumstances of today.

The central task of historical films is to reproduce history, to re-evaluate history, not to retell history. A truly valuable historical film should present history truthfully from all kinds of distortions and misunderstandings, and thus give history a new estimation and a new evaluation from a correct realistic perspective, so that history can be revealed in a brand new and correct posture in the form closest to the public, so that the audience can see the truth of history and gain the lessons left by history. Of course, the so-called re-presentation of history and re-evaluation of history does not mean that the creators of the film use a ready-made worldview to impose on history, but with the help of the correct historical methodology, to excavate the truth of history from the chaotic historical phenomena, to deduce the lessons of history, so that the past history gains new colors and realistic meaning in the historical film.

The re-creation of historical figures and the re-portrayal of historical figures should be an important work of historical films. Since the art of mankind can create typical characters as its main task, the film, a new type of art, is no exception to the creation of characters. The characters in historical films must also be newly re-created, given complete character, and given human nature and realistic value, so that those characters who have died in history can gain new life and become living people with flesh and blood, so that the reproduction of history can be more realistic, and the reflection of history can be more clear.

Historical film is a new path for Chinese films today. From this path, new artistic gains can be brought, and the same destination that all Chinese arts should reach today can be reached—a fighting destination. This requires the redoubled efforts of all Chinese film workers. However, at the same time, we must clearly recognize that this path is absolutely not the only path for Chinese film career today, and it is absolutely not the only working line for all Chinese film workers. On the contrary, if the historical film once deviates from its duty to re-evaluate the past reality, leaves its duty to provide the experience and lessons of class struggle, and abandons its duty to promote national self-esteem and self-confidence, then it will immediately lose its due position. Its existence is not only meaningless, not only a waste, but also a sin of evading reality! At the same time, in the process of war of resistance and national construction, in the great revolutionary struggle, the scope of China's film career is very broad, and the materials are very rich. Any attempt to promote it throughout the country in a special environment in a special way is actually not only a mistake!

### The China Travel Service Under Reconstruction

— Qi Che

The disintegration within "China Travel Service" is an unfortunate event for the entire drama movement. However, within this misfortune, there may also be a stroke of luck, as it is already growing new muscles amidst the corrosion. The disintegration of China Travel Service is indeed a severe lesson for us in the drama and writing fields; and the rebirth of China Arts is indeed adding a new force to the drama movement. Currently, under the leadership of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, a veteran fighter in the theatrical world, China Arts is diligently working hard, further recognizing the correct path of the drama movement, and moving towards a promising future day by day. Mr. Tang Huaiqiu of China Travel Service is also working desperately hard to rebuild the China Travel Service. After this turbulence, he should be able to learn from past experiences, live up to the glorious history of the past, and pursue this great era, taking on the mission of the drama movement once again. In this way, after everyone takes a breather, they can continue to work together for the drama movement, still struggling amidst hardships and difficulties, which may not be a major benefit for the drama movement!

We are unwilling to revisit those unbearable old memories. We have no selfish motives, nor any prejudices. We love "China Arts" as a lively and energetic new force in spoken drama, and we also love "China Travel Service" as the pioneer of Chinese spoken drama in the past. The fervent expectation of almost every drama movement enthusiast is that they will understand each other and develop together. However, regarding "China Arts," we seem to know a lot. Regarding "China Travel Service," for many months, apart from seeing some sporadic news about its organization in the newspapers, everyone seems very unfamiliar with it. In order to understand the current situation of "China Travel Service," this reporter specially visited their new headquarters at No. 11 Fengzhi Terrace in Wan Chai.

Fengzhi Terrace is a quiet and beautiful environment. Their headquarters are located high up, separated from Wan Chai like an island, offering a distant view of the sky and the sea. In response to my knock, a young partner opened the door to welcome me. Secretary Tang came out to greet me. He was rehearsing a play with many like-minded people. The reporter asked him to continue their work, and Ms. Tang Ruoqing, who had just returned from Guangxi, took the reporter upstairs to sit and chat.

After exchanging pleasantries, we got to the main topic. First, regarding her feelings about the China Travel Service family, Ms. Tang said: "When I came back, I felt that everything had changed. The emergence of a new China Arts troupe is a good phenomenon in the drama movement. I am very unwilling to dwell on those minor misunderstandings, and I hope to see each other again in our work. After arriving in Hong Kong, I have been busy, but I will take time during the day to visit my comrades at China Arts. Currently, the feelings between us are still very good. As for myself, my work in Guangxi was very meaningful and promising, but for the sake of China Travel Service, I had to come back."

So, what are the recent activities of your troupe? "All the time of our China Travel Service is now spent busily rehearsing. There are seven or eight new national defense plays. Some of them are performed in Cantonese. We are scheduled to perform for the Women's Four Associations Conference at the end of this month, and then we will have a formal public performance next month. After a month, we will return to our motherland."

The lineup of their new China Travel Service is as follows:

Male — Tang Huaiqiu, Li Xiaoyun, Fei Jiabao, Zhang Xuefeng, Zhao Shu, Huang He, Liao Fan, Zhang Yufeng, Zhang Darong, Zhang Ying, Lin Lin, Wen Cun, Chen Suzhou, Chen Yulin, Fan Qiuran, Li Changyan, Zhong Jun, Hong Chengfu.

Female — Tang Ruoqing, Tang Ruoying, Wu Jing, Xu Suxue, Ye Deli, Ouyang Yan, Peng Guohua, Xia Meixi, Wu Chunzhen, Deng Zhujun, Zhang Xuemei, Li Bingyi, Liu Meng, Rong Zhenni, Gong Xueman. Their organization is as follows: In addition to Tang Huaiqiu serving as the head of the troupe himself, they have also hired two full-time directors and instructors. The work is divided into four departments: 1. General Affairs Department, headed by Li Xiaoyun, including accounting, general affairs, documentation, and storage. 2. Publicity Department, headed by Fei Jiabao, including writing, photography, and advertising. 3. Theater Affairs Department, headed by Tang Huaiqiu concurrently, including costumes, makeup, cues, and effects. 4. Stage Design Department, headed by Zhang Xuefeng, including lighting, scenery, and props.

They have decided to stage a total of twenty-five to thirty scripts. They have already started rehearsing, and the first performances will include "Tears of a Flower," "Phoenix City," "Motherland," "Cold on the Frontier," "Original Sin," "In the Beginning of Man," and "Our Hometown," among others. Among them, "Tears of a Flower" is Mr. You Jing's latest work, depicting the painful life of a dancer, pointing out the path for urban fallen women to participate in patriotic work. It has a tight structure, vivid techniques, and correct ideology, even better than "Night Light Cup." China Arts places great emphasis on this play, and rehearsals are already halfway done.

The conversation has been quite extensive. Ms. Tang then took the reporter downstairs to see their rehearsal. After interrupting the tense scene and introducing me, the reporter sat down, and they continued their rehearsal.

This place was originally the dormitory for the staff, and it is also the "stage" for rehearsals. On one side are rows of old canvas beds, and on the other side are tables, chairs, and various stage props. This scene is called "Phoenix City," a national defense play brought by Tang Lishi from Guangxi. Mr. Tang Huaiqiu himself plays the leading role, disguised as the commander-in-chief of the guerrillas, holding a mimeographed script while gesturing and making expressions. Ms. Ruoqing, playing the spy, is the most familiar and vivid character. Under the atmosphere of solemnity and liveliness, those acting, watching, memorizing lines, and helping to direct fully reveal the arduous life of theater people, which is also a life of art.

—— Work hard and rebuild the glorious China Travel Service under the great mission of the national salvation movement! On the way back, the reporter silently prayed!

### In Commemoration of the First Anniversary of the Chinese Cultural Association: What Have Theater Workers Done?

After the heroic action of the nation began on July 7, 1937, thanks to the timely gathering and heroism of literary and art workers, the "All-China Literary and Art Association" was established in Wuhan on March 27, 1938. Since then, all literary and art workers across the country who were unwilling to be slaves have gathered under the sacred banner of "Resisting Japan," working for the victory of the united front through a unified front approach.

In the theater and film industries, many heroic records have been created over the past year. Due to technical and industrial organization constraints, there are not many good films, but efforts can still be seen. In terms of screenplays, works such as "Hot-Blooded Loyal Souls" and Cai Chusheng and Situ Huimin's "Blood Splattered Baoshan City," "Guerrilla March," etc., are all good creations that would not have been produced before "July 7th."

The achievements of theatrical creation are even more radiant. Theater is inherently an art of struggle. The more magnificent the social reality, the more theater cannot but have leaps forward. In terms of plays, Ouyang Yuqian's "Behind the Green Gauze Tent," Tian Han's "Final Victory," Hong Shen's "Flying General" and "Escaping Death," A Ying's "Spring Breeze and Autumn Rain," Yang Hansheng's "The Night Before," You Jing's "Night Light Cup," Tang Naishi's "Long Live China," Chen Baichen's "The Devil's Cave," Xia Yan's "Within a Year," Wang Zhenzhi and others' collective creation "Bandit Captain," Hu Chunbing and others' collective creation "No. 77," the Guangdong Theater Association's twenty-two writer's collective creation "Yellow Flower Mound," Yu Ling's "Women's Apartment" and "Tears of a Flower," Wu Zuguang's "Phoenix City," and Hu Chunbing's "Chinese Sons," are all glorious milestones.

In terms of action, there is even more accumulation of countless efforts. Taking Guangdong and Hong Kong as examples, from the heroic sacrifice at Huanghuagang on March 29 of last year, through countless joint performances, donation performances, and the "Drama Festival," to the countless performances of specialized theater troupes this year. The practice of large-scale joint performances, the establishment of the Hong Kong Youth Theater Association, the establishment of a general communications station by the Guangdong Theater Association in Qujiang, and the establishment of communications stations and the First Theater Troupe in Hong Kong are all achievements of the warriors within a year, and they are also in line with the work of the National Literary Association.

In the past year, our theater workers have used actions to cooperate with the tasks of the Literary Association. In the future, to commemorate the glorious year of the Literary Association, we must have more work to serve the resistance war.

### Technical Research: Speaking on Stage Technique

— Dun Lu

7.  How to Recite Lines

The art of drama is a visual art, and at the same time, it is an auditory art.

Opera performers must know how to sing, and spoken drama actors must know how to speak. Speaking is originally a daily life activity for people. Except for the mute, everyone knows how to do it. Logically, there is no need to learn it, so some people think that it is easy to perform spoken drama and opera. This seems to be correct. Speaking originally does not require learning, but the way of speaking on stage—reciting lines—does require learning, because everything on stage is no longer everyday life. Moreover, learning to recite lines is even more difficult than learning to sing. Because opera words are accompanied by music, with a fixed beat and a fixed tone. Once you learn the notes and tones, you can sing, and when you sing, the timing will never be wrong. You only need to add some emotion. However, spoken drama lines have no fixed tones or notes, but although they don't, they seem to be fixed invisibly. It's just that the person who makes the score is not a musician, but the actor himself. Judging from this, reciting lines on stage is probably not much easier than singing, right?

The meaning of reciting lines, Bosworth said: "The actor uses the technique of reciting lines to interpret the role he plays." This illustrates the importance of reciting lines in performance. It not only helps, but is the best tool to express the character of the character and convey emotions. The famous actress Dousi reciting the multiplication table (some say she recited the multiplication table) moved the listeners to tears. This is the best example!

When an actor is studying the role he is playing, he should also plan the intonation, strength, rise and fall, and pauses of the lines.

Pronunciation is one of the essential conditions for becoming a successful actor. A good voice can make his lines successful. It is best for an actor to have a mezzo-soprano voice, which can be high or low, making it easy to use rhythm and change when reciting lines.

There are two things to pay most attention to when reciting lines: intonation and tone. Intonation is the rhythm of a sentence, and tone is the rise and fall of each word. This is a lesson that spoken drama actors must practice. Usually, we hear some actors reciting lines on stage like reading a book, which is harsh to the ear because they don't understand intonation. An actor who doesn't understand the method of reciting lines, no matter how beautiful his posture and facial expressions are, is still useless. Unpleasant lines will make the audience drowsy, destroying the mood and effect.

The key to using intonation is not to lose the sense of reality. A few years ago, theater actors deliberately lengthened the sound of words, trembled continuously, and used a monotonous, turbid tone, as well as reciting in a memorized style, a medicine-selling style, a lecturing style, etc. These methods are all unacceptable, because they don't sound like speaking and lose the sense of reality.

However, it must also be remembered that "life on stage is not real everyday life." In order to achieve stage effects, everything on stage has inevitably been embellished and exaggerated. Although reciting lines on stage should not lose the sense of reality, it is not really real life, but only stage reality.

The use of intonation must sound smooth to the ear, so that it can be heard smoothly and seem real. However, the main purpose of reciting lines on stage is to convey emotions, so it must be moving, touching, and at the same time, it must be used to grab the audience's attention. This all depends on the use of high and low, strong and weak, and rising and falling tones. (To be continued)

### A Performance of "Dogs": The Red Stage Troupe's Charity Performance Last Night

— Wei Ling

Since the outbreak of the "August 13th" War of Resistance, the creative output of multi-act plays reflecting the war has been quite considerable (referring to published works). However, the only ones that I find relatively most satisfying are Chen Baichen's "Dogs," also known as "Demons Dancing Wildly" (Note: That is, "China Arts"'s performance of "Carried Away" and "The Times"'s performance of "New Official Takes Office," originally named "The Devil's Cave"), and Wu Zuguang's "Phoenix City." Of course, strictly speaking, the script is not in the book, but belongs to the theater. Whether a script is good or not can only be determined after performance and multiple performances. However, although the latter has not been performed here, its quality as a literary work can still be glimpsed; the former has been performed here many times by various theater troupes, and is undoubtedly one of the most excellent works in terms of the play's own techniques and performance effects.

This performance of "Dogs" by the young Red and White Troupe was a charity performance for the YWCA's San Guang Troupe to provide disaster relief for refugees. At the same time, compared to "Phoenix City," which writes from the front, this is the only excellent work that writes from the opposite side, and it is worth watching. Last night (the 8th), at the Confucian Hall on Caroline Hill, after four hours of performance, I felt a bit of emotion and some opinions:

The play itself: Whether in the material, theme, or characterization, everything can be said to have escaped from formulaic writing. The best thing is the colloquialization of the dialogue—its vulgarization. The material roughly writes about a group of cold-blooded traitors in the occupied areas, performing a puppet show while fighting for power and profit, highlighting the cruel oppression of our people by the enemy, and the heroic counterattack of the guerrillas. Interspersed between them are the traitors' jealousy, incompetence, and foolishness... The whole play uses dog barks to symbolize a group of traitors, adding satire, profound humor. It is very vivid and concrete, just as the author said: "It is really a depiction of a fallen city, a typical record of the rise and fall of a traitorous regime." From this point, its theme is indeed very urgent and needed now, but the tone of the whole play does not seem to be very unified, and some parts are too exaggerated, so it is difficult to reconcile with a normal tragedy—especially in the third act. Secondly, there is too much use of indirect writing, for example, the smuggling of goods and the activities of the guerrillas are not very clear. Finally, the ending scene should not break the mime style, in order to give the masses a greater stimulus. However, small flaws do not obscure the overall strengths. On the whole, the script is successful.

Performance aspect: First of all, it is worth congratulating that it was performed by a newly established troupe with insufficient material conditions, relying solely on the efforts of a group of young, emotional workers, and the achievement is commendable. What is particularly worth mentioning is the stage design, which uses a new realistic style to handle it—such as in the first and second acts, a tofu shop destroyed by artillery fire and ravaged by the enemy. The peeling and mottled earthen walls and gray skin, bullet holes... The distant view of red leaves in the autumn suburbs, farmhouses, withered trees, firewood stacks in the third act... The surprisingly complete basement in the war zone in the fourth act, with interwoven brick marks... All of them are vivid and quite novel, quite attractive to the audience.

However, in terms of lighting, perhaps due to a lack of materials (seeing that there were no dimmers, overhead lights, only a row of footlights, and three or four side lights), the light intensity often failed to meet the requirements of the script, which did not match the stage design, resulting in a significant loss of perspective for the entire play. Especially in the outdoor scene of the third act, if the lighting is used to enhance the distant view, the effect would definitely be better; if there were dimmers available, it could further help the expression and coordination of the atmosphere and rhythm of the entire play.

The sound effects are good. The play is titled "Dogs," and the barking and howling of the dogs are exaggerated clearly and appropriately. The other calls, cheers, laughter, and frog sounds are all very similar. In the third act, the symphony of frog sounds and dog barks as the night of the wilderness... helps to add color to the originally desolate parts of the script.

Acting aspect: I feel that—Liu Dianyuan (played by Xu Guoyu), apart from lacking some small movements, has reached a certain level in terms of expression, voice, and emotion; Sun Danniang (played by Li Lang), appearing as a female hooligan, is fierce enough but not charming enough, lacking small movements, saying "Damn it" too often and too loudly; and likes to blink and raise her heels on her toes, otherwise she would have been quite successful. Li Buyun (played by He Mantang) has too heavy of a local accent, not flexible enough in his movements, and did not cooperate with others, but is still competent. Pan Qishan (played by Ye Zhongzhi) is not strong enough, only rude, his stage movements are too mechanical, and his local accent is too heavy; it is still possible to cooperate. Wu Congzhou (played by Ling Ke) has a general voice, lacking rise and fall rhythm, did not fully express the arrogance of citing classics, but his hand movements and posture are quite lively, able to cooperate with others on stage, and his emotional grasp is quite appropriate. Qiao Dayou's (played by Shu Lun) dull state fully expresses a mental patient who has been overstimulated, and he is successful in his facial expressions, movements, and emotional grasp, but his voice is a bit lacking. A Ying, that is, Xiao Yindi, played by Zhong Ying, is quite successful, her crying is very artistic, but unfortunately not very cooperative. In addition to the female workers and policemen being perfunctory and passable, A Xiong, that is, Xiao Kou'er, played by Hu Ruihua, Chen Wanxing, played by Chen Peifang, and Hua Yuehong, that is, Xiao Baicai, played by Lulu, are all very competent.

Conclusion: The advantages of this play's performance—the coordination of atmosphere and rhythm, the voice is quite loud; overall, it is very cooperative and performed vigorously. Disadvantages—lack of small movements (in general), and the positions are a bit messy, especially when lying down. In short, for such a young troupe that has only been established for more than three months, the performance of this play has reached such a level, which is commendable.

In great haste late at night on April 8th

### Spring in the "Isolated Island" Theater Scene

— Lan Zi

Spring has come, and the flowers of spring have begun to bloom in the languid and lonely "isolated island." The theater people of Shanghai are preparing to decorate a long spring season.

As a training center for new drama movement cadres, the "Franco-Chinese Drama and Art School" held its first public performance at the labor bureau auditorium in the French Concession on March 18th and 19th. It was restaged for the second time on the 25th and 26th, and received good reviews from the public.

The plays performed by the Franco-Chinese School this time included: first, the new-style dance drama "Poppy Flower," choreographed by Wu Xiaobang and composed by Chen Gexin; second, the children's drama "Little Fisherman," written by Xu Xingzhi and directed by Wu Xiaobang; and third, Molière's comedy "The Affected Young Ladies" (Les Précieuses ridicules), adapted by Feng Zhizhong and directed by Xu Xingzhi. In this performance, in addition to receiving good reviews for their acting skills, they also discovered an excellent actor, namely Ms. Chen Cuidi, who played the role of "Little Fisherman." The performance of "Poppy Flower" has also opened up a new path of development for Chinese new song and dance dramas. Currently, Wu Xiaobang and Chen Gexin are working hard to create their second play, "Good News in Spring," and everyone hopes for even better achievements.

One new event in the "isolated island" theater scene is that Li Jianwu took the stage to play a character in his own play.

It was the first Sunday practice performance of the "Shanghai Theater Art Society," which took place on the morning of March 26th (Sunday) at the New Light Theater. The play was Li Jianwu's "This Fading Spring" (a two-act play), directed by Chen Xihe. As a result, not only did the playwright go on stage, but the director also went on stage and became an actor. At the same time, excellent actors such as Xia Xia, Bai Li, Xu Li, and Wang Mingsun co-starred. It goes without saying that this performance received excellent reviews, and the acting skills of Li Jianwu and Xia Xia were particularly praised.

They decided to restage it once more on Sunday, April 2nd.

Although the "Friendship Society," which had been dormant for a long time, also began to develop in the spring. That was their "Acting Competition," which was scheduled to be held every Saturday afternoon "in any place that can be used for performance." The first time, it was held in the classroom of the affiliated middle school of Jinan University, with the "Longmen Theater Society" and the "Snow Shadow Theater Society" each performing a one-act play. "Longmen" performed "Lesson," and "Snow Shadow" performed "Executioner." You Jing and Lu Si and others came to serve as judges. As a result, "Snow Shadow"'s performance was better and won the championship flag (retained for one week).

This method can be said to be a shortcut to "discovering new talents" and promoting the development of small theater troupes.

Various small theater troupes have also had many performances during these days, and each theater society is rehearsing, preparing for continuous performances.

Who would have thought that most Chinese theater publications have short lifespans, as if they must be so. However, destinies are different. The "Drama" weekly in "Guidance Report" was published until the fortieth issue (March 26th) and was discontinued due to circumstances. This publication was originally the closest to the small theater troupes. Its discontinuation made many people feel sorry.

What is pleasing is that the "Film and Drama" weekly in the "China-US Daily" sponsored a Sino-American Readers Club: This is a group of film and drama enthusiasts, with more than two hundred enthusiastic young people gathering together to study the art of film and drama, led by theater person Chen Lusi.

Recently, after the establishment of the "Club," they also created an "Amateur Experimental Theater Troupe," which decided to rehearse "Smuggling," "By All Means," and "The Affected Young Ladies." It is rumored that this film and drama weekly may be changed to a daily.

Silently, a new theater publication has been published, namely the "Drama Outpost" weekly in the "Wenhui Evening News." Few people know about its appearance. It was already the fourth issue on March 27th. Although the space is still small, with only more than three thousand words per issue, the layout is very lively, and the content is rich, with correct theories and reports. There are also translations of famous theories from time to time. The writers include Zhang Geng, Zhang Min, and Lü Gang.

It can be said that "Drama Outpost" stands on the island's theatrical scene with the posture of a simple worker.

Spring brings new hopes, and the theater people of the "isolated island" are decorating a long spring season.

March 29, 1939, Shanghai.

### The China Salvation Drama Troupe

Various Organizations Extend Warm Welcome

The China Salvation Drama Troupe is preparing to go abroad to propagate and has passed through Hong Kong. Since arriving in Hong Kong, various cultural organizations and salvation organizations, recognizing the troupe's efforts to participate in the War of Resistance in China over the years and its long-standing contributions, have held warm welcomes. In addition to this publication first convening a film and drama forum at the Saile Garden on the 1st of this month, warmly welcoming and discussing the issues of the salvation drama movement, the China Women's War Disaster Relief Association also held a tea party at the Kyoto Hotel at 3 pm on the 7th to welcome all members of the troupe, and invited celebrities from the local cultural and art circles to participate, and the situation was very enthusiastic. (Please refer to the local news of this newspaper yesterday for details). The Hong Kong Youth Drama Association has also mobilized youth theater troupes and drama workers throughout Hong Kong to hold a grand welcome party at the auditorium of South China Middle School in Mong Kok tonight (9th) at 7 pm, and a forum for exchanging opinions on the drama movement will be held at the association's address on Connaught Road Central on Tuesday of this week (11th). It is said that the Chinese Arts Progressive Association, the Student Relief Association, the Amateur Friendship Society, and other cultural organizations and women's organizations will also hold separate welcomes during the day. In addition to Ms. Wang Ying, the deputy head of the troupe, giving a lecture on "The Rebirth of China" at the YWCA last Thursday afternoon, she will accept the invitation of the Amateur Friendship Society this morning (9th) at 9 am to give a lecture there. This Thursday afternoon at 3 pm, she will give a lecture at the China Women's War Disaster Relief Association. It is understood that the troupe will stay in Hong Kong for a month and a half, and will exchange opinions with various cultural organizations and salvation organizations as much as possible before going abroad, and engage in salvation propaganda work. It is hoped that the salvation workers in Hong Kong, in addition to warmly welcoming them with the feelings of brothers and sisters returning from the front lines of the war, should also respond and help in practical work, so that they can achieve greater results.

Film and Drama Mini-Reviews

### An Encouragement to Ms. Chen Yunshang

— Pan Lang

Ms. Chen Yunshang was originally a major star in the South. Recently, she returned from a trip to Shanghai with great acclaim, and there are even calls to take the "Movie Queen" position nationwide and replace the current holder. Speaking from the standpoint of the press, we naturally rejoice and celebrate the achievements and progress of a star, especially for the cultural future of our Chinese nation. However, seeing those gaudy promotional materials that resemble the past adoration of actors, and hearing those sickening words of "personal praise" that have deviated from the realm of film and drama, we feel compelled to say a few words. For the sake of truly cherishing Ms. Chen's artistic achievements, and for the sake of sincerely caring about the future of China's film industry, we believe that Ms. Chen and those who genuinely care about her will be able to pay some attention to this.

What are the main factors that have contributed to Ms. Chen Yunshang's past success in film and drama? I think it is unnecessary to list them one by one, as everyone already understands. The most important reason for Ms. Chen's recent "rise in reputation" in film and drama is, first and foremost, that Ms. Chen dared to say when leaving Hong Kong for Shanghai: "I will not act in plays that are detrimental to the country and the nation." Moreover, the film "Mulan Joins the Army" has also factually proven that Ms. Chen has "not broken her oath." A star, especially a female star in such an environment, who can possess such national consciousness and revolutionary sentiments, will inevitably be loved and admired by all parties. Secondly, it is due to many conditions in the objective environment, such as the fact that since the War of Resistance, famous female stars from the North have either wandered around or escaped from theaters into their families; the collapse of the Shanghai film center and the change in the situation in the South China film industry; and the special preference of the Chinese people for films and plays with national consciousness and national defense and revolutionary themes. All of these have helped Ms. Chen's success. However, at the same time, it should also be known that: First, although Ms. Chen's past subjective efforts are admirable, there are shortcomings—it is hoped that in the future, she can break through the encirclement of all "excessive praise," work harder to move forward, continue the spirit of not acting in films with "romantic encounters," and actively play a role in films related to national revolution and social transformation movements, striving for progress. Second, Ms. Chen's past success is due in no small part to her appearance, posture, knowledge, skills, and attitude in dealing with people—Ms. Chen herself must admit this. In the future, to maintain and enhance her past success, the most important thing is to be able to avoid getting caught in love affairs, not be swayed by vanity and generous rewards, stand firm in the position of a female star leader and role model, contribute her efforts to national revolution and social reform, and participate in practical mass movements at any time, even to the extent of Ms. Wang Ying's efforts for the national revolution. At the same time, she should also strive to learn, pay attention to self-cultivation, and in addition to caring about current affairs, she should also possess basic knowledge of history, philosophy, and general social economics. Leaders grow up in the masses and in constant struggles. Ms. Chen certainly won't consider our expectations as excessive, right?

For those who love Ms. Chen Yunshang's film and drama art, excessive praise out of genuine love is also a matter of human sentiment, and it is not necessary to suspect them of having other intentions. We are even less willing to criticize them harshly. However, in such an unreasonable society, in this society where people have become commodities and lost their humanity, we cannot allow all excessive praise to hinder Ms. Chen's future progress in film and drama art. Gaudy promotional materials similar to those used to adore actors, and absurd "personal praise," not only cannot add glory to Ms. Chen but are also sufficient to obscure and insult Ms. Chen's past genuine successes, and even trigger all obstacles on Ms. Chen's path to struggle and progress! Honest film and drama critics, in the future, on the one hand, should clear away all the smoggy praise and adulation that surrounds successful artists and stars, and on the other hand, should establish correct critical standards. We want to praise the success of any artist or any star, and at the same time, we must also point out their possible shortcomings and their future path to progress. We not only want to help promising stars achieve greater success, but also help promising stars become popular revolutionary stars, so that they can play a leading and exemplary role in the film and drama industry and even the cultural world. At present, we should do our best to advance the national revolution against Japanese fascism, and in the future, we must also complete the great project of building a new country and a new society. Every member of the film and drama industry, and every critic in the film and drama industry, should never forget their sacred mission at any time!

### Important Correction

In the last issue of this publication, due to the rush in typesetting and the fact that the proofreading staff forgot to correct the typesetting sample, there were numerous errors, for which we are deeply sorry! For example, in the article "Welcome the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe," which was originally written by "The Era Drama Troupe," Mr. Jin Shan's signed electrotype was used, which is particularly laughable. As for the captions for the photographs, the first frame was "Mr. Jin Shan and Ms. Wang Ying in the battlefield," the second frame was "Group photo of participants in the symposium to welcome the Chinese National Salvation Drama Troupe," and the third frame was "The Second National Salvation Drama Team departing from Shanghai," all of which were omitted. Moreover, the symposium record contained countless typos and omissions. In addition to severely punishing the negligent staff, we hereby sincerely apologize to Mr. Jin Shan, all members of The Era Drama Troupe, and our esteemed readers! Also, the issue of this publication dated March 16th was the 15th issue, but it was mistakenly typeset as the 16th issue, which is also corrected. — The Editor

### South China Team Breaks the Stalemate and Finally Wins the Silver Shield Championship Back Home. Police were Lucky but Lacked Real Strength, Losing After Leading. Scots Beat Middlesex 4-3 to Win the Second Division Championship

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] The special Silver Shield Football Final was held in two acts, first and second division, in the Hong Kong Stadium on a fine and sunny afternoon yesterday. As it concerned the battle for the championship, it was highly valued by the fans. The stands on all sides were packed, forming a "city of flesh".

The second division match between Scots and Middlesex started at 2:15 pm. The soldiers were eager to win the top spot. The match was fiercely contested. The Middlesex team often revealed flaws in both offense and defense, while the Scots team had high morale and performed better coordination, so they defeated the Middlesex team 4-3 and won the championship. The score was 2-1 in the first half and 2-2 in the second half.

The first division match between South China and the Police Association began at 4:00 pm. The situation was full of suspense and very intense, but not very exciting. South China finally won 5-3 with superior skills, winning the championship for the fourth consecutive year. Such glory is rare in the football world.

The Police team took to the field with the same lineup, ambitious and intending to make things difficult for South China. In addition, they had very good luck, reaping two unexpected rewards in the first 20 minutes of the first half, taking a 2-0 lead. This greatly affected the morale of the South China team. However, luck cannot be relied on for long. In the end, the outcome was determined by the superiority of football skills. In the second half, the South China team's performance improved, and they finally broke the stalemate and completed this great achievement.

South China's first goal conceded was very unfair. The first goal was an own goal by Li Tiansheng. At that time, seeing the enemy approaching, he wanted to pass the ball to Bao Jiaping, but in the rush, he lifted his foot and kicked it into his own net. The second goal was a mistake by Jiaping. When he was catching the ball, he lost his footing and fell to the ground, and the ball slipped out of his hands, allowing Huang Yougui to rush up and shoot, hitting the target immediately. "The old cat burns the stove" was truly unexpected.

Mai Shaohan's absence due to a foot injury was one of the reasons for South China's initial slump. Although Li Guowei, who filled Shaohan's position, performed quite satisfactorily in this battle, the entire defense line was initially disrupted due to the relocation of several players. For example, Tiansheng's reassignment to right inside and Liu Qingcai's reassignment to left forward both felt out of place, especially Qingcai, who also couldn't last the whole game.

Guo Yingqi's performance as right forward was excellent, worthy of praise. Even though Mills was so fierce, he was marked tightly and not allowed to relax. He was able to attack and provide supplies, and the front line benefited greatly from his support.

Among the front line, Deng Guangsen, Li Zhaorong, and Feng Jingxiang performed the best. Li Enliang also worked hard, but his control of the ball was not perfect and he hoped to improve it. Luo Douwen was still slow and missed opportunities, and he no longer had the skills to cover up his shortcomings and charge forward.

South China's comeback victory was the expected result, but the technical level of the performance was very low. For such an important final, the lack of good contribution was somewhat disappointing.

The Police team knew that their football skills were not as good as South China's, so their tactics did not emphasize "routines" but relied on hard work, resulting in a mediocre performance with no special features.

In general, domestic football fans are very grateful to referee Mr. O'Mara, because he was discerning and impartial in his awards and punishments. Therefore, the Police team's hard work was unsuccessful, and several offside shots were also ruled invalid.

South China fought with an incomplete lineup and still won a great victory. This not only proves South China's strength but also reflects that the Police team is not a strong team. Their ability to win the final was mostly due to luck. However, they did not show the style of a community team and had to sign the treaty of surrender, allowing South China to dominate.

First half

Five minutes: The Police team was unusually dominant. The front line broke through South China's defense twice and approached the goal, causing South China's defenders to be very busy.

Ten minutes: Mills passed diagonally to Hall. Hall dribbled and shot, but Jiaping caught it high, giving up a corner kick.

Fifteen minutes: Rongzhao took a long shot from the center. McDade didn't take it seriously, but the ball landed in front of the goal and bounced up again. At this time, McDade hurriedly slapped it with his hand, and the ball went over the bar, giving up a corner kick.

Twenty minutes: The Police's front line was like a whirlwind, fiercely attacking South China's territory. Qingcai and Tiansheng retreated to defend. Wengui got the ball and crossed it to the center for Guicai and others to attack. Tiansheng arrived first and, without waiting for the ball to land, bent his foot and wanted to pass it to Jiaping, but the ball kissed the tip of his shoe and went into the net. At this time, Jiaping was standing a little far away and couldn't save it, watching helplessly as he gave away a gift. 0-1 South China lost first.

Thirty minutes: Mills advanced rapidly along the side, charging straight in. He passed the ball at the right time, but Tiansheng failed to block it. Jiaping ran out to grab the ball, but he got it and then lost it. Shicai took advantage of the situation and kicked it in. The ball hit the left post and bounced into the goal. 0-2 The Police took the lead.

Thirty-three minutes: South China counterattacked fiercely. In the chaos, Zhaorong got the ball and headed it to Jingxiang. Jingxiang took advantage of the opponent's unpreparedness and shot into the net. It was very beautiful. At this time, 1-2, South China was still losing.

Forty-three minutes: South China's players continued to attack. Luo Douwen and Nov fought for the ball on the left. During the entanglement, Nov mistakenly committed a handball foul in the penalty area and was penalized with a penalty kick. Zhaorong took the shot and scored, making the score 2-2.

Second half

Two and a half minutes: The Police's five-man front line advanced into South China's key area. Hall received Guicai's pass in a crowded area and shot in a goal, but he was already offside, and the referee ruled it invalid. (At the beginning of the second half, Li Siliang and Hall respectively represented their teams as center forwards)

Seven and a half minutes: South China did not slacken their fighting spirit because of the thorny road ahead. Jingxiang dribbled the ball, and Zhaorong also got his help. Ten yards away from the left of the goal, he flicked the ball into the net, making the score 3-2, turning defeat into victory.

Nine minutes: The Police launched another general counterattack. Hall and Guowei, about fifteen yards in front of South China's goal, both jumped high to head the ball. Huang Wengui, who was behind, caught the opportunity and shot without waiting for the ball to land, making the score 3-3 again.

Thirty minutes: The two sides were locked in a fierce battle, and the strength was not yet determined. The fans supporting South China were anxious. In a flash, they suddenly saw Enliang get the ball and rush past Bilibao and Guangyu, running alone at an astonishing speed. He finally didn't disappoint and shot the target, making the score 4-3, turning defeat into victory.

Forty minutes: Hall returned to defend as left center back, and Parker became right inside forward. Guicai acted as center forward. Then Guangsen intercepted a ball from the center and moved forward. Hall picked up his pace to intercept, but was judged to have committed a foul, and was penalized with a free kick. Guangsen took the kick from more than 30 yards outside the goal, shooting straight towards the goal. Bilibao lifted his foot to block it, and although the ball's momentum was slightly deflected, it still went towards the goal. McDade hurriedly deflected it, hoping to make it a wild ball, but instead he knocked the ball into his own net, making the score 3-5. As a result, South China maintained this record and won the championship. After the match, Mrs. Bret, the president of the Football Association, personally presented the awards.

### South China's Lineup Determined for Tomorrow's Asahi Cup Match, Mai Shaohan Not Selected Due to Illness

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] In tomorrow's second Asahi Cup football match, South China will play against the Army at 4:00 pm at the Naval Stadium.

The Army's lineup has already been decided. South China's team was drafted the day before yesterday, but there are still changes.

The goalkeeper was originally intended to be Tan Junqian, but he said that his injury had not yet healed, so Zhang Rongcai was selected to take on this battle.

Mai Shaohan has a slight illness and needs to rest, so Li Guowei was transferred to play inside back.

Liu Qingcai has been quite tired recently and cannot last the whole game, so Guo Yingqi was selected for right forward, and Xie Jinhong was used for left forward. There is no change in the front line. The lineup is as follows:

South China Athletic Association

Zhang Rongcai, Li Guowei, Li Tiansheng, Xie Jinhong, Liang Rongzhao, Guo Yingqi, Luo Douwen, Li Zhaorong, Li Huitang, Feng Jingxiang, Deng Guangsen

Reserves: Liu Mao, Hua Weipei, Chen De, Yang Shuiyi, Liu Qingcai, Bao Jiaping, Deng Qin

Fraser, Sheehan, Mays, Sorso, Dillies, Daffy Road, Si, Coludi, Gurney, Amberson

Reserves: Mossam, Bo, Jay, Frank Dirsch, Wilkinson, MacDonald, Ling

### Eastern Expedition Off to a Good Start, Beats Hanoi French Army 4-1

The Eastern football team played against the Army team in Hanoi on the afternoon of the 7th of this month. In the first half, Chen Bingtu opened the scoring first. In the second half, Zhang Jinhai also scored a goal. After a while, the Army's left winger broke the duck egg. The Eastern players worked hard throughout, and Chen Bingtu scored again. Finally, Li Deqi made a strange contribution. In total, the Eastern team had four goals and the Army had one.

### Yesterday Evening Basketball Game, First Division, Star Island Defeats Pui Ying ... Second Division, Kwong Chung Defeats Pui Ying... Three Games Scheduled for Today, First and Second Division

The first game of the public men's basketball tournament last night was between Kwong Chung and Tsing Tsao in the second division. The two teams fought, and the strength difference was obvious. Kwong Chung had the upper hand throughout. Although Tsing Tsao tried its best to counterattack later, it finally lost to Kwong Chung 30-49. In the second game, Star Island played against Pui Ying in the first division. Although Pui Ying tried its best to compete with them, it still lost 26-52. However, Star Island's victory was already expected. Moreover, the team's performance last night was better than the previous two times, especially Li Pei Chi, Dai Fu Cheng, and Xin Yalang, who made brilliant performances one after another. Although the others were slightly inferior, the team's coordination was well received by the audience. When passing the ball, they took advantage of each player's position and used feints. At the same time, the ball handlers were able to understand each other's intentions, causing the opponent to run around and unable to defend effectively. The adjustment of reserve players did not affect the original formation, which was also an advantage of the team. As for the opponent, Pui Ying, except for Pan Jinhong, who had some shooting skills, the rest had no purpose. The team's coordination was even more scattered and full of flaws. Passing the ball could not avoid interception by the opponent, and receiving the ball could not achieve the effect of closing in. Therefore, although there were opportunities to penetrate the opponent's territory, they lacked agile passing, and soon they were surrounded on all sides. The low shooting accuracy was also the reason for their great defeat.

Game process: Star Island's Li Pei Chi opened the scoring. Then they took the lead with 11-4 and 20-7. At the end of the first half, Pui Ying was down 9-26. In the second half, Pan Jinhong of Pui Ying showed his talent and made contributions repeatedly, but his efforts were to no avail and he failed to impact the overall result. Therefore, they lost successively with 13-36 and 17-44. Until the end of the game, Star Island won by a large margin of 52-26.

In the last game, Pui Ying played against Tsing Chi in the second division. Pui Ying had good coordination and shooting. Chen Xiyang scored repeatedly. Although Tsing Chi tried their best to resist, they lost 23-26 in the first half. The competition in the second half was fierce. As a result, Zeng Ying defeated Tsing Chi with 50 points against forty. The results are recorded below.

A Stupid Sports Method That Kills Without Drawing Blood? Wang Xuezheng
Any kind of exercise, if the method is wrong, is not only useless but also harmful. Not only is exercise like this, but everything else is too.

After reading Mr. Chengbo's article "Dumbbells and Rubber Bands Killed My Brother" in the Youth Garden of the Circulation Daily, Mr. Chengbo not only weeps for his brother but also "weeps for countless enthusiastic and motivated young people who want to improve their fitness." I certainly sympathize with him. However, Mr. Chengbo actually attributes his brother's death from acute pneumonia within a short period of twelve days to dumbbells and rubber bands, denouncing them as "a stupid sports method that kills without drawing blood" and "a harmful and foolish method."

Mr. Chengbo's brother suffered from acute pneumonia and died within a short period of twelve days. If the exercise method is wrong, it can indeed weaken or even severely damage the major organs of the heart and lungs, reducing the body's resistance. However, dying from acute pneumonia within a short period is not necessarily the result of an incorrect exercise method, nor is it caused by correct dumbbell and chest expander (i.e., the rubber bands Mr. Chengbo mentioned) exercises. Many people who never engage in any kind of exercise also die from pneumonia. The cause of death of Mr. Chengbo's brother may have an indirect relationship with exercise, or even if there is a direct relationship, it should be considered objectively. For example, automobiles are convenient transportation tools in today's civilized era, but we often see accidents or even fatalities caused by careless driving or mechanical failures. Can the inventors and users of automobiles also be said to be foolish for this reason? Can automobiles be called weapons that kill and draw blood (sometimes they don't even draw blood)?

Engaging in any exercise, if the method is wrong, is not only harmful to the heart and various parts of the body but can also cause insomnia, muscle stiffness, and hinder digestive and metabolic functions. To determine whether an exercise method is correct or wrong, clever or stupid, one should not only look at the flexibility or intensity of the exercise. Other factors such as posture, breathing methods, the body's reaction, and even various things directly or indirectly related to health or exercise are all very important.

Mr. Chengbo's so-called "European and American hard-working methods," I don't know what he means. Is it only dumbbell and chest expander exercises that are "hard-working"? Are the sprints of the 100-meter race, the endurance of long-distance races, and the charging and sprinting in football and basketball all "soft-working"? To determine whether an exercise is too strenuous, one should not only look at the external reactions of the body but also the reactions of the most important respiratory and circulatory systems. For healthy people engaged in dumbbell and chest expander exercises, if the method is correct, the reactions caused to the major organs of the heart and lungs are actually milder than those caused by sports such as running, football, basketball, and rowing. This is because dumbbell and chest expander exercises are almost entirely exercises for the upper body, while the exercises that cause the most intense reactions and the greatest strain on the heart and lungs are not upper-body exercises but leg exercises. During exercise, the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood increases, which is the starting point for various changes that exercise can cause inside the body. This change can make breathing rapid and increase the speed of blood circulation.

### Our Authorities Are Vigorously Restricting Exports: Tungsten Ore Exports Have Decreased Sharply; February Exports Were Over 8,000 Dan Worth 3 Million Yuan; Supply Shortage, Demand Exceeds Supply, Prices Will Continue to Rise

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Tungsten ore is a raw material used for military needs. The amount produced in Guangdong and sold to various countries annually is quite large. In recent years, due to the spreading war clouds, countries preparing for war, such as Britain, Germany, and Japan, are vying to purchase it, resulting in the price per dan rising from 123 yuan to over 200 yuan. This has led smugglers to risk stealing it for profit. During the first half of 1938, the average monthly export of tungsten ore from our country reached 10,661 dan, worth approximately 3,865,264 yuan in national currency. Among them, 1,500 dan were sold to Germany, worth 847,790 yuan in national currency; 500 dan to France, worth 146,389 yuan in national currency; 375 dan to the UK, worth 122,259 yuan in national currency; 7,895 dan to Hong Kong, worth 2,903,141 yuan in national currency; and 375 dan to the US, worth 144,038 yuan in national currency. However, since Guangzhou fell last year, our authorities have not only strictly prohibited smuggling but also vigorously restricted exports, leading to a sharp decrease in exports compared to before. The quantity of tungsten ore exported in February this year was only 8,187 dan, worth approximately 3,826,530 yuan in national currency. Of this amount, 6,614.8 dan were transported to Hong Kong for transshipment to countries such as Japan, Germany, Italy, and the UK, worth approximately 2,938,72 yuan in national currency. The remaining 2,039 dan were transported to other ports, worth 862,658 yuan in national currency. Recently, due to the shortage of supply, the demand in Hong Kong exceeds the supply. Foreign merchants in Hong Kong are also actively purchasing it, and it is expected that prices will continue to rise.

### Blessings to the Growing Literary Association

— Xiang Yu

Blessings to the growing Literary Association, blessings to the Literary Association warriors in the struggle, blessings to the national writers who are holding a grand annual meeting in Chongqing today!

The flames of the War of Resistance have eliminated those corrupt national dregs. All progressive writers have grown stronger and organized themselves in the flames of war, working for the War of Resistance and fighting for the people's suffering. Some have concentrated in Hankou from all over the country, and from Hankou to Chongqing, working hard to strengthen the spiritual mobilization for the War of Resistance. Some carry their pens, put on their military uniforms, and follow our loyal and brave soldiers, entering and leaving the battlefield, writing about the various postures on our battlefield, and giving great encouragement to the people of the whole country. Some go deep into the people, doing work to connect with the masses, so that the relatively backward masses can deeply understand the importance of the people helping the army, and provide many conveniences to the soldiers. Some join the rescue teams, rescuing our wounded soldiers, so that our soldiers who shed blood on the battlefield will not make unnecessary sacrifices. Some go far away from the motherland, go overseas, and do various propaganda among overseas Chinese and internationally, so that international people and overseas Chinese can understand the significance of our War of Resistance and how to serve the motherland, and not be harmed or slandered by the conspiracies and rebellions and the evil propaganda of the [missing word or character]. We would also like to take this opportunity to obtain substantial material and spiritual assistance from the international community and overseas Chinese. As the Literary Association opens its annual meeting today, we express our respect to all writers who are working hard for the country.

Under the current situation of the [missing word or character]'s continued offensive, the National Literary Association is holding an annual meeting in Chongqing, which is of great significance in itself. We can also take advantage of this period when the nation's outstanding writers gather together to review our past work and promote future work. What we have not done well enough in the past, what we should strengthen, more exploration, more connection; there is no doubt that our future work will be further developed.

Naturally, what we can use is still a pen, and the power we can exert is also on a pen, just as it was said in the purpose of the establishment of the National Literary Association last year, "We should unite the power of the scattered comrades, just like the soldiers on the front line using their guns, use our pens to mobilize the people, defend the motherland, smash the invaders, and strive for victory; the fate of the nation is also the fate of literature and art, so that our soldiers can exert their greatest power to illuminate the world and all mankind with the greatest brilliance of Chinese national literature and art." As for how to use our pens to exert the power of "striving for victory", such as making our "great brilliance of literature and art" "illuminate the world", this still depends on the individual efforts of each writer, under the great goal of resisting the enemy and under the leadership of the National Literary Association.

A few of us are on this isolated island overseas. This is a transportation hub between the mainland and overseas. This is a metropolis where people from all over the world gather. This is also a major base for shameless "literary vermin", traitor theorists, and national betrayers. Today, they oppose the War of Resistance, and tomorrow they advocate "thorough peace." Today, they respond to Konoe, and tomorrow they sabotage the group. Obliterating the facts and distorting the truth, without the mirror of the pen, the strange goblins that gather from all over the world will reveal their true forms nakedly, then their tricks will emerge one after another, and there will definitely be many obstacles to the future of the War of Resistance. In addition to our current enemies, our targets should be concentrated on this group of scoundrels. Because the publications run by the [missing word or character] make it clear that they are speaking for the [missing word or character], and only those publications that are disguised on the outside and decorated with color, but are actually full of poison inside, are likely to have a misleading influence. We should give these monetary humans and the fallacies written by these human monsters a head-on blow. This is the duty that we should fulfill by "defending the motherland with our pens." This is also the work that we cannot relax, in addition to expressing our warm support for the National Literary Association holding its annual meeting in China.

### What is Expected of Literary Organizations

— Lat

Literary activity is the action of people engaged in literary work. Whether literary activity achieves its due results depends entirely on the degree of effort and the correctness of the path taken. Without a high degree of exertion of subjective power, even good objective environmental conditions will not achieve good results. Therefore, in order to enable literary activities to obtain their due results, and in order to enable literary activities to cooperate with the current reality and become a powerful movement, first of all, the unity and organization of writers is the most important issue. Strengthening the unity of writers, improving the mutual trust between writers, and igniting the fire of work with a lively attitude are necessary foundations for promoting literary activities.

Although we already have such an organization on the island, the organization itself still has many weaknesses. The main reason is that it is only an agency for calling in the city, and it has not yet become an agency for promoting practical work in various places. This specific situation is reflected in the fact that the work between writers is limited to calling, and it has not yet been effectively promoted to various places. Therefore, the scope of our literary activities is very narrow, and it falls far behind the objective situation of the War of Resistance. This is an important point that we should pay attention to.

Secondly, in terms of organizational work, the promotion of mutual help, mutual research, joint responsibility, and common development among writers is also very insufficient and weak. The organization of mass literary activities and the discovery of new authors, especially the discussion and research of various theoretical issues and critical issues, also show a very lax and backward attitude. This is also something that we cannot but pay attention to. Therefore, we should urgently require the literary organization itself to become an agency for mutual help, mutual research, joint responsibility, and common development for writers; it should become an agency for organizing mass literary activities and promoting new authors; it should become an agency for calling for the discussion and research of various theoretical and critical issues; and it should also become an agency for promoting literary movements in neighboring areas. This is absolutely possible, and it can be accomplished, and it will never make our wishes become empty and delusional.

Strengthening the unity of writers is certainly important, and it is the only basis for solving work problems. But only by effectively unfolding all the work of the organization and seriously grasping the connection of all parts of the work can we guarantee that our unity will be more consolidated and deep.

### Two Poems

— Huang Lu

War Clouds

Lining up

Shouldering our rifles

Stepping forward

We

March forward

We cross mountains

We wade through water

We shed blood

For survival

For freedom

We are willing

To serve in this war

Before dying

The moment before dying

He still held his gun

To his comrades——

Like me

For you, motherland

Die on the battlefield

And then he closed his eyes

A smile on the corner of his mouth

Like the sunset outside the window

Hiding in the woods with infinite brilliance

### At Maojintai

— Dun Sheng

——Frontline chasing grass (part two)

Maojintai is located in a mountain depression on a small, unnamed branch of Dinghu Mountain. A gurgling stream flows through the village. Many slogans of resistance against Japan are posted around the trees, and large characters written in charcoal are horizontally arranged on the whitewashed walls, indicating that this village has been visited by many young people who have been saving the country, and that they have been propagandizing for many times.

Maojintai lies prostrate in the silent mountain depression. The people have already fled, and there is not even a dog or a chicken. The doors of every house are tightly locked with iron locks. In the past, this mountain village was a barren wilderness. We had been marching in the dry and desolate Dinghu Mountain for two days and nights, and had not eaten for more than a day. Everyone's faces were very dirty, revealing a layer of iron blue. They were thin and haggard, and their eyelids were black.

Suddenly, we discovered that the door of one house was open. Several of us brothers, some carrying large guns, some carrying box guns, some holding steel knives, and some carrying red-tasseled long-handled spears, walked into the doorway. Inside, it was as silent as a ruin.

"Is anyone there?"

We patted the door of the room inside.

A man who looked about thirty years old, wearing a farmer's clothes, with a thin face and a worried expression, walked out of the room and looked at us.

"Brothers! What do you want?"

"We haven't eaten for more than a day. We want to find something to eat."

"There's nothing good to eat, only some sweet potato jerky!"

The farmer moved a pottery jar from a wooden board cabinet. The mouth of the jar was stuffed with clothes. He pulled out the clothes. Inside were yellow, blackened sweet potato jerky. The hungry brothers each put it in their mouths, but it was too hard, and swallowing it blocked their chests and esophagi, causing them to hiccup.

"I'll cook some porridge for you, brothers. You've worked hard; there's nothing good to eat in these chaotic times. You see, there's no one else in this village. The grain has all been transported to the deep mountains, leaving only me to guard this village."

As he spoke, he took out a tattered package from the wooden board cabinet. He untied the package. Inside were some messy pieces of torn clothing and scraps of cloth. He took out a very small jar from inside. The jar contained yellow millet.

"I only have this little millet."

"Aren't you eating any yourself?"

"Tomorrow, I'm going to flee into the deep mountains too!"

He poured out the yellow millet and poured it into a pottery basin. The rice contained a lot of sugar, but now we didn't care about anything else. Several brothers helped him put the millet into the water basin and lit a fire in the stove.

At this time, everyone started talking. He asked us where we came from and what part we were from. He said that he was a member of the guerrilla team, and the [missing words or characters] guerrilla team was in the deep mountains. He often came to Maojintai village to scout out the enemy's movements. Their team was hiding in the [missing word or character] one or two li away from this village.

From his conversation, I knew that he was not a farmer, but a very capable comrade, a special affairs worker of the [missing words or characters] Route Army. (To be continued)

### The Season When Kapok Blooms

— He Chengjiang

Spring has arrived, and it is the season when kapok blooms again!

I love kapok, just like I love my hometown, because I love its striving heart. It is a tall tree in the South. Its personality is that it always grows taller than other trees, and the color of its flowers symbolizes the raging fire of youth. The shape of the flowers also seems to contain boundless passion.

When the spring breeze gently kisses heaven and earth, the fine rain floats lightly in the sky, the spring thunder faintly rumbles, and the swallows skim the water surface, the kapok flowers are then in full bloom with brilliant flowers. It is easy to see them in the suburbs of Guangzhou, especially on the top of Yuexiu Mountain. My hometown, the hilltops and fields, are all covered with many kapok trees. Every year in March, in the season of missing my relatives, I return to my hometown and am sure to look at the kapok flowers to my heart's content, or pick up fallen flowers.

Kapok is the provincial flower of Guangdong, and also the symbol of the revolutionary spirit. Guangzhou has many kapok trees, so Guangzhou is called Red Kapok City.

However, Guangzhou today has fallen into the bloody hands of the [missing word or character]. I don't know if our provincial flower has been chopped down? I think: if the kapok flowers are still unharmed, then the top of Yuexiu Mountain will be redder than blood, and the fire and beacon will illuminate the sky, complementing each other. Now, in the southern fields, it is the time when kapok is in full bloom, and the spirit of Guangdong is also stirring!

Last year, the storm of Daya Bay brought the smoke of gunpowder. Although it devastated the sand pears, lychees, star fruit trees, etc., it also devastated the kapok trees; the kapok is the only tall tree in the South, and it grows all over the mountains and valleys. Although Guangzhou has suffered, it is still alive. Although its spirit has been beaten down, it has not disappeared!

The kapok flower blooming is also the time when the spirit of Guangdong is greatly revived. The guerrillas downstream of Luofu Mountain are active, making it difficult for the [missing word or character] army to cope. Aren't the recent fierce battles in Tianjiangmen North Street and Lile Village the reappearance of the spirit of Guangdong?

Some people are saying: The spirit of Guangdong seems to have disappeared! I think: unless the southern kapok is completely withered, if the kapok flower can bloom with fiery red flowers on the green field in spring, the spirit of Guangdong will not disappear. However, we ask for more luxuriant kapok flowers. Then, we must arouse our spirits and defend our hometowns! Otherwise, when the kapok flowers are all cut down by the enemy, the hometown will be gone!

Now, it is the time when kapok is in full bloom, and it is also the time when the spirit of Guangdong should be greatly revived!

### The Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

She wasn't what he thought she was. She was clever, even though she was weak. Because she was a clever weakling, she dared not risk her life—she feared exceeding the limit of his tolerance for her; so she simply lingered, waited, and ignored, or had to ignore, whether the consequences of this lingering and waiting would be as she wished. Her only hope, of course, was to return from an unfortunate detour to the happy gate of her home. Secondly, she would rather, between this and misfortune, put off the inevitable for a while, and no longer leave. Further, she did not know herself, but only let her fate be sealed. She noticed that he was unwell and knew that he had fallen into hardship. In order to turn him from hardship to a dead end, she allowed herself to go from the edge of hope to the end; so her cleverness made her begin to threaten him.

'I'm going to leave!'

'What?'

'I'm telling you, I'm going back!'

'Well, I'm telling you, you'll only return as a corpse!'

'Do you still want to force me to go? ! The result of you forcing me to go is probably nothing else.'

He had considered everything about this job thoroughly. The predicted problems did not occur. What did occur was unexpected. So he hesitated and worried. Where he stood, he kept stamping his feet. The loose snow was stamped into a discolored snow cake, and after it broke, it came off the bottom of his shoe, causing his foot to sink deep into the snow, close to the ground. He seemed to be able to see the comrades waiting for him at home, the comrades fighting on the snowfield under the sky, longing for him with disappointed eyes. He seemed to be saying:

'Comrades, I have failed... a shirt, a pair of shorts, a postage stamp for a registered letter, a pack of cigarettes, and... and bullets, pheasants, bears... everything is gone... Comrades, I have failed, you can do whatever you want to me! ...Comrades, do whatever you want to me, I can't bear this responsibility, I have failed...'

'Responsibility - these two words were two iron burdens, pressing on his shoulders! He wanted to move them down, but move them to whom! Where to move them?

Finally, he took two deep breaths of the icy cold air, clearing his abnormal reason and emotions.
