### Political Education Work of a Model Division (2)

— Xiang Rong

There are current affairs issues, Chinese affairs, and world affairs. Then, what is considered "less"? I think, on the one hand, it should be appropriate to the level of the educated. For example, you cannot instill the education for cadres into ordinary soldiers, and you cannot instill the education for senior cadres into junior cadres. We must make different demands based on the different levels of cadres and soldiers, and junior and senior cadres. On the other hand, when implementing education, don't expect too much, thinking you can instill everything at once. There are often comrades like this who, when they start a class, ramble on from heaven to earth, from China to foreign countries, from ancient times to the present. Their intention is good; they hope that the educated person can immediately become proficient in ancient and modern China and foreign countries. But what is the result? The result will be the opposite, and the result will be that nothing is understood. Therefore, when implementing education, we should have a plan to "proceed step by step" and seek in-depth understanding within appropriate limits.

What is "refined"? I think there are also two aspects to this: On the one hand, we must grasp the core and understand a problem, mainly focusing on the fundamental aspects and grasping the main points of the problem. For example, taking the summary of the past 23 months of the War of Resistance as an example, if we were to calculate it like a running account, I am afraid that three days would not be enough to calculate it clearly, and one hundred small points could not be included; this is what is meant by grasping the core, which we should pay special attention to in our education. The other aspect is to go deeper, which means that the issue being taught should enable the educated to understand it in depth. How can we achieve depth? The main methods are: (1) The teaching method of the instructors, (2) Extracurricular supplementary education, and (3) Regular tests. I will leave the detailed content to discuss later.

(2) Linking Theory to Practice

It is often possible to encounter such things where the person being educated can be responsible for what is purchased in books, remembering every sentence; but when put into practice, he is no longer like that. There are also often comrades who can recite the articles very well, but they do not understand the content of the articles at all. Such things are not uncommon. What is the reason for this? I think there are also two reasons for this: On the one hand, the instructors only read from the books, without using facts to illustrate the principles and articles spoken about in the books, without forming a kind of hypothetical scenario within the possible range based on some original ideas in the books (just like the hypothetical scenarios in military education), and asking the educated to deal with it, in order to inspire their minds to acquire the principles of application. On the other hand, the person being educated does not pay attention to putting effort into "how to link theory and practice." Some even only seek to memorize the articles without seeking to understand them.

Therefore, our second requirement when implementing education is to require linking theory to practice, requiring both the instructors and the educated to pay attention to this issue.

(3) Step-by-Step Improvement

The content and progress of education should be based on the principle of gradual improvement, from shallow to deep, from the present to the future. Therefore, we need a unified and planned set of educational materials. Therefore, such phenomena are manifested in the political education of the troops: in the supply of teaching materials, there is a phenomenon of coping without a plan; in the content of education, only focusing on some current affairs issues, failing to enable our political education to progress and improve. This phenomenon should be overcome as soon as possible.

Regarding the compilation of political teaching materials, we have the following opinions:

For soldiers, the first is a soldier's textbook, including all aspects of army life, followed by a primary political textbook, divided into two volumes. The first volume is on the Sino-Japanese issue, including issues related to our current War of Resistance and striving for final victory, etc. The second volume is on unified fronts, including the unity of the entire nation today and the prospect of realizing a new China based on the Three Principles of the People in the future. Finally, there is an advanced political textbook, also divided into two volumes. The first volume is a brief history of the Chinese revolutionary movement, and the second volume is common knowledge of social sciences. The completion of this plan is expected to take three months for the soldier's textbook, which will be completed during new recruit training. The primary political textbook will take eight months to a year, during which the troops may suffer casualties due to combat, but it will not fundamentally change. The advanced political textbook will take one year, which is prepared to be used if the composition of the troops does not completely change after one year. I think such a plan is more suitable for our current environment and requirements.

For cadres, company and platoon cadres are one level, battalion and regimental cadres are another level, and brigade cadres are another level. Based on the different political and cultural levels of these three levels of cadres, we compile political teaching materials with different depths and progress. The central issues of these three levels of teaching materials range from Chinese issues, unified fronts, the Three Principles of the People, the history of the Chinese revolutionary movement, political economy, to philosophy, etc.

The above is about the content and progress of basic political education. The content and progress of cultural education will be discussed later. The education of current affairs issues is based on the actual situation, compiling explanations and lecture materials, and conducting it during extracurricular time.

Fourth, Promote Self-Study

The last principle is to promote self-study. The importance of promoting self-study is equal to the importance of establishing a regular political education system.

How to conduct self-study? First, we must provide reading materials suitable for soldiers and cadres with different political and cultural levels. Second, when formulating the schedule for daily life and training, we must stipulate the time for self-study. Third, we must provide organization and guidance for soldiers' and cadres' self-study. Finally, political organs at all levels must regularly supervise and inspect.

The content of self-study, I think, includes reading books and newspapers, keeping diaries, holding discussion groups or symposiums, and writing articles (such as summaries of work experience and lessons learned, and battle communiques, etc.).

Four Political Education System

According to our current political education system, the main points are as follows:

A. Soldier Political Education:

(1) Education time: Five political education sessions per week (Saturday morning is for cleaning weapons, afternoon is for rest) (each session is one hour, two lectures, two review sessions, and one current affairs education session?

(2) Attendance: All soldiers (including squad leaders and company headquarters buglers, communications personnel, medical personnel, and orderlies) are required to attend class except for those on duty.

(3) Instructor: The political instructor or instructor of the company is responsible for it.

(4) Classroom: When stationed, a relatively fixed classroom is set up and furnished with blackboards and benches. When marching, a relatively quiet open space is found to avoid noise and distraction.

(5) Classroom discipline:

1. Attendees must listen quietly to the instructor's lecture and are not allowed to do other things?

2. No private conversations are allowed?

3. No looking around is allowed?

4. No unauthorized changing of seats is allowed?

(6) Teaching method

1. Before class, the instructor should fully prepare the lesson, to the point of memorizing the main points, and prepare auxiliary materials for the listeners to read (such as maps, pictorials, tables, etc.)?

2. When lecturing, first state the general meaning of the entire content of the textbook, so that the listeners have a brief impression; then explain each sentence and paragraph; finally, use a question-and-answer method to summarize? This allows people with higher political levels to gain a little more, and even those with lower levels can get an essential understanding.

3. When lecturing, according to the content of the textbook, explanations with factual evidence must be added. One should not just read the articles, but one should not pull the scope too far, talking from heaven to earth, so that the soldiers are confused.

4. If the content of the textbook can be applied to model education (such as maps, pictorials, tables, etc.), it should be linked to the model when lecturing and shown to the soldiers' eyes, making it easier to understand and remember.

Editorial

### On the Issue of Guiding Returned Overseas Chinese

To demand that the War of Resistance and national reconstruction achieve final victory and complete success, we must mobilize all the living and material forces of the entire Chinese nation, especially the power of the vast overseas Chinese. This goes without saying. Even in the current stage of the War of Resistance, if we want to prevent the continued advance and deepening of the × people, if we want to enhance the combat effectiveness of the front lines, launch guerrilla warfare behind the ×, and step up the cultivation of new forces in the rear to prepare for the future general counter-offensive, to reduce and expel the Japanese × from China and establish an ideal state based on the Three Principles of the People, the prerequisite especially depends on the full mobilization of the vast power of the overseas Chinese. Regarding this point, I can obtain full proof just by looking at the spontaneous mobilization power of the overseas Chinese since the War of Resistance began more than twenty months ago.

However, the facts of the past two years have proven that we are still doing a very bad job of mobilizing the power of the overseas Chinese. The particularly serious phenomenon is that the vast number of overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to the country to serve and are willing to cooperate with the motherland's national reconstruction efforts often suffer from a lack of direction. Therefore, how to guide this kind of overseas Chinese who voluntarily serve in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction is not only the first step in mobilizing the power of the overseas Chinese, but also the most urgent task at the current stage to overcome difficulties and strive for victory!

Recently, Hong Kong's overseas Chinese organizations received a notice from the Overseas Department stating that the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has sent personnel to be stationed in Kunming for a long time to guide returned overseas Chinese. Their tasks are as follows:

(1) Matters concerning overseas Chinese returning to the country for inspection or engaging in the development of domestic production, providing investigation and introduction when passing through Yunnan, or contacting relevant local agencies;

(2) Matters concerning overseas Chinese returning to the country for service, providing consolation or guidance when passing through Yunnan;

(3) Matters concerning overseas Chinese students returning to the country for further education, providing guidance when passing through Yunnan;

This new facility of the Central Government can indeed largely solve the serious problem of guiding returned overseas Chinese at present. It will definitely be of great help to mobilizing the power of the overseas Chinese and to the cause of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction in the future. It is deeply believed that enthusiastic overseas Chinese in various places will feel a lot of convenience. However, if we want to carry it out effectively and realize it perfectly, we should also pay attention to the following points, which require the cooperation of all levels: First, this work should be led by the Central Government, appropriately absorbing the power of mass organizations and social leaders, and carried out on a planned and large scale. Sending commissioners stationed in Yunnan should be regarded as the first step, and it can be extended to overseas regions as needed and as possible in the future. Second, the current work of the special commissioner sent by the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is to comfort and guide, which is indeed a very important task, but it should also be supplemented by propaganda work in the future. This work should, on the one hand, provide concrete and practical explanations of the current internal and external environment and needs of the motherland, enhance the national self-esteem and self-confidence of overseas Chinese, and encourage overseas Chinese to return to the country to serve, return to the country for investigation, and cooperate in developing all production and construction undertakings. On the other hand, we should step up the promotion to the vast number of compatriots in the rear of the country, expanding it to the occupied areas, so that returning overseas Chinese will be warmly welcomed and assisted by their compatriots throughout the motherland, just like returning to their old homes and living with their parents, brothers, and sisters. Third, the institutions or personnel responsible for guiding the work of the overseas Chinese must not only have noble personalities, upright conduct, enthusiasm, and integrity, but also have a deep understanding of modern politics and the international situation; they must have strong confidence in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction; and they must have the determination to support unity and solidarity. Only in this way can they gain the trust of the people and overseas Chinese. Otherwise, the impact will be unimaginable.

### Our Troops Fight Fiercely in the Suburbs of Shantou Northwest Tension × Attempts a Desperate Gamble Pseudo-Army in Chahar and Sui Contacts for Rebellion

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 20th Dispatch] The military focus is still in the Northwest. × is transferring troops from various lines and transporting them north as much as possible. It is expected that × will launch a full-scale attack on our river defense line in Shaanxi and Henan. The purpose of × invading Shantou is largely based on political and economic considerations. From a military point of view, it only has a restraining effect. We have seen through the enemy's plot and made arrangements in advance. ×'s risky desperate gamble will inevitably suffer a fatal blow.

[This Newspaper, Xi'an, 22nd Dispatch] The current situation on each battlefield is stable. The entire situation in southern Shanxi is under our control. There have been local fierce battles in recent days. × in Chahar and Sui has slightly increased. The strength of our guerrillas is increasing day by day. The pseudo-army is contacting us for surrender. The area near Daqingshan is still within our sphere of influence. There are still fierce battles in southern Shandong.

[This Newspaper, Chongqing, 22nd Dispatch] The war in central Hubei is silent. Qianjiang × is surrounded by us and there is no movement. Wuhan × is busier in its movements, seemingly with intentions. We are fully prepared everywhere and there is no worry.

[This Newspaper, Guilin, 22nd Dispatch] Our army in Youtou has entered a new position. The overall situation on the Guangdong battlefield is extremely stable. There have been repeated guerrilla battles along the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line in the past ten days, killing 400 to 500 × people.

Fire in Shantou Not Extinguished All Night

[This Newspaper, Shaoguan, 22nd Telegram] Hua Zhenzhong, commander of the Shantou Garrison, is actively preparing to fight a decisive battle with × in the suburbs of Shantou. Our elite troops are concentrated in the Chaoyang, Jieyang, and Chao'an areas. Morale is high. If × continues to advance, it will be severely damaged. The authorities believe that our strength is strong and will not transfer reinforcements. According to reports, the × people originally wanted to feint to the east and attack the west, shifting our target, and then taking advantage of the gaps to attack in other directions.

[This Newspaper, Shaoguan, 22nd Dispatch] The number of × troops invading Shantou is too small and they will definitely not be able to penetrate inland.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st Telegram] Foreign news: The Japanese army landed in Shantou, starting at 4:00 am this morning. They landed separately on both sides of the river. The Chinese army resisted for a long time. Japanese transport ships sailed upstream along the river, and mechanized units also landed in large numbers. Now the Japanese army is advancing in two wings to surround Shantou, and the railway from Shantou to Chaozhou has been cut off, it is said.

[Continental News Agency, Urgent News from Xingning] On the morning of the 21st, the × army landed at Nangang, Beigang, and Dahao Wharf in separate routes. The × in the north and south ports slanted westward. From 7:00 am to 12:00 pm, they repeatedly charged, but were repelled by our army. More than 400 × people were killed. Subsequently, the × army surged in. At the same time, the × speedboats that broke through the blockade at Mayu Port had entered the port, occupied the China Merchants Bureau wharf, and landed multiple × army tanks, which were unloaded from here and rushed into the urban area. The garrison and police were ordered to defend to the death, and fierce street battles broke out. We used the major buildings to inflict heavy casualties on the × people. At 3:00 pm, our army ran out of ammunition and transferred its position to continue the resistance. The × army and traitors set fires everywhere. The fire pillars in the city center soared into the sky and did not extinguish all night on the 21st. Our local military and political authorities are now commanding in a certain place. Yesterday, they received an order from Acting Commander-in-Chief Zhang, ordering them not to give the × people a chance to penetrate inland. The × landing at Beigang intends to advance along the dike highway to Chao'an. The purpose seems to be the Xiangzi Bridge, because the Han River flow suddenly narrows and the water flow is turbulent in the Xiangzi Bridge area. Our authorities have also built a dam here, so × wants to destroy this dam to endanger the people. The movements of the × in Dahao are currently unknown, it is said.

[Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd] The Japanese regiment that broke into Youtou late last night has occupied the Shantou Municipal Government and other key points today. They are currently fighting with the Chinese army in the suburbs. Another landing force occupied the Shantou Customs and the naval air station. Before the Chinese army withdrew, someone set fires in three places in the city, resulting in several major fires, which have been extinguished this morning.

Great Victory in Shanxi The More We Fight, the Stronger We Become

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st Telegram] After the great battle in southern Shanxi at the beginning of the month, our army seized documents from the × army, which clearly stated that their invasion of Zhongtiao Mountain was made with the greatest determination, hoping to "eliminate" our army on Zhongtiao Mountain in one fell swoop. As for the troops they dispatched, they totaled four infantry regiments and one small artillery regiment, invading southward in a large scale. When the × army advanced to the vicinity of Pinglu, our army, in order to lure × deeper, abandoned Pinglu and retreated to the surrounding areas to set up positions, causing × to fall into a heavy encirclement. At this time, a certain army on the left wing attacked Zhangdian from Yuanqu in the west to cut off the × army's rear, further threatening the × army's base in Yuncheng. At the same time, our army in Pinglu also took the opportunity to launch a large-scale counter-offensive. As a result, a fierce battle broke out again in this mountainous area, with blood and flesh flying and corpses everywhere. The situation was tragic and unprecedented. The × army suffered extraordinarily heavy casualties, and our army also made heroic sacrifices. After this bloody battle, × saw that the retreat to Zhangdian in the east had been cut off, and there was also a risk of the base in Yuncheng falling. In order to ensure the safety of its retreat, × began to withdraw in three routes from Anyi, Zhangdian, and Jiexian. Our army then launched a large-scale attack, chasing and killing the fleeing enemies. Countless × people were killed. × fled everywhere. Now, except for several hundred remnants × west of Funan Town, the rest have retreated to their original positions, and some have even fled into Hejin. Our army then recovered Maojindu on the 10th and Pinglu on the 11th. At this point, ×'s attempt to invade Zhongtiao Mountain had failed again. Also, in the fierce battles in Liulin, western Shanxi, since the beginning of the month, × occupied Liulin with a division, and then invaded Jundu and Qikou. Later, our reinforcements attacked from Sanjiao Town, attacking the rear of the × army in Liulin from the left. × was deeply afraid that its rear would be cut off, so it fled in panic, with some retreating to Lishi and others fleeing back to Zhongyang. As a result, our army successively recovered Liulin, Jundu, and Qikou. There is no trace of × west of Liulin. As for ×'s invasion of southwestern Shanxi this time, attempting to "mop up" our army, our army implemented mobile guerrilla tactics, causing × to collapse. This is another victory after the great victory in northern Hubei. This proves that the more we fight, the stronger we become, and the more confident we are in victory.

Our Army Active in the Yangtze River Area

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd Telegram] Foreign news from Shanghai: There are now two things that prove that Chinese guerrillas are still continuing their activities in the Yangtze River area. It is reported that a large number of guerrillas have appeared on the Yangtze River bank near the port in southern Jiangsu. When the Japanese army landed and attacked, they retreated gracefully. Another thing is that the Japanese authorities have requested foreign ships not to sail in the Mingdao area waterway, because there are guerrillas lurking on the shore.

[Central News Agency, Boluo, 21st Telegram] On the morning of the 3rd of this month, five × soldiers, carrying two rifles, went to Linxiang to seize plows. Two people first drove them back, and the remaining three searched for women in civilian houses. Three women were captured on the spot. At this time, our guerrillas received the news and rushed to the rescue. They saw two × soldiers forcibly raping women indoors. In great anger, they immediately opened fire and shot them dead. Another × soldier was committing bestiality inside, and wanted to escape when he heard the gunfire, but was tightly held by the raped woman. Although × struggled desperately, he could not escape. At this moment, Wu Ying, a member of our guerrillas, stepped forward and captured the × alive. With the help of his comrades, he was tied up and escorted back to the headquarters. Wu was also stabbed by ×. The military officer, upon receiving the report, has issued an order to commend the personnel and women who contributed to this incident, and also gave Wu Ying a generous subsidy for his injuries to show encouragement.

### Dereliction of Duty by Civil Servants Referred for Disciplinary Action

[Chongqing, 22nd Telegram] The Central Public Officials Disciplinary Committee recently reviewed various cases. In addition to cases that were deemed to involve criminal suspicion and were transferred to the court for handling, those who were decided to be disciplined include Chen Yi, Magistrate of Naxi County, Sichuan; Li Fangqiu, Secretary; Sun Xiong, Warden of the Second Special District Prison in Shanghai; Gao Fan, Warden of the Detention Center; Wu Deyuan, Prosecutor of the Beiping District Court; Zeng Bingquan, Warden of the Zunyi District Court Detention Center in Guizhou; Tang Rixin, Magistrate of Ningyuan County, Hunan; Cheng Shenyuan Bangyan; Liu Zhizhai, Prison Guard of Qianjiang County, Hubei, and several others.

### Regulations on Foreign Exchange Sales: Ministry of Finance Promulgates New Rules to Consolidate Wartime Finance; Shanghai Banks Limited to Weekly Withdrawals of 500 Yuan; Interview with Zheng Tieru, Head of the Bank of China in Hong Kong

[Hong Kong News] Yesterday, news suddenly spread in Hong Kong that Chinese banks in Shanghai had been ordered by the government to close for three days to force foreign banks to sell foreign exchange. This caused considerable surprise in banking circles. It was verified that although the government initially considered a three-day closure, it was never implemented. However, to strengthen and consolidate finance, the Ministry of Finance yesterday promulgated new regulations, setting a fixed amount for foreign exchange sales at 500 yuan. Amounts exceeding this require a written application stating sufficient reasons. Yesterday, the Bank of China in Hong Kong received this telegram from the Ministry of Finance. Simultaneously, domestic banks in Shanghai were ordered by the government to limit withdrawals to no more than 500 yuan per week. To clarify the government's intent in issuing this decree, a reporter from the Hong Kong News Agency interviewed Zheng Tieru, head of the Bank of China in Hong Kong, yesterday afternoon, who kindly provided an explanation. The transcript of his remarks is as follows:

Addressing Wartime Finance: A Necessary Measure

Director Zheng said: "To strengthen and consolidate finance and counter the ×'s plot to seize foreign exchange, our government has now issued a clear order. The Ministry of Finance has instructed Shanghai government banks to restrict foreign exchange sales to no more than 500 yuan. Amounts exceeding this require sufficient justification. This is a necessary measure to address wartime economics. There is nothing strange about it. In Japan, people cannot buy even ten yen of foreign exchange. Even wanting to buy two US dollars to purchase a foreign book is considered insufficient reason and is rejected, with permission only granted after the war ends." The reporter asked: "Why is there a rumor circulating between Hong Kong and Shanghai about Shanghai banks closing for three days?" Director Zheng said: "The Ministry of Finance initially considered this, but later canceled it and adopted the current method instead. In short, this is a necessary measure for the government to address wartime conditions. In reality, our foreign exchange reserves are strong. As long as the people wholeheartedly trust in the national currency, we can certainly defeat the ×'s plot and gain the upper hand."

×'s Invasion of Shantou: Remittances from Overseas Chinese Not Affected

The reporter then asked: "Has the ×'s invasion of Shantou and the Chao-Mei region affected remittances from overseas Chinese?" Director Zheng said: "Temporarily, there may be slight inconveniences in transportation, but various financial institutions have already relocated inland and will find ways to continue operations. Consider that even after Xiamen fell, Fujian's remittances continued as before." The reporter further asked: "What is the status of overseas Chinese remittances this year?" Zheng said: "It can reach about 300 million Hong Kong dollars. Overseas Chinese should now vigorously implement austerity measures and remit more funds back home to replenish the nation's foreign exchange reserves."

National Currency Once Fell in Value: Later Recovered to Original Level

It was found that yesterday morning, due to the rumor of Shanghai banks closing for three days, and the lack of clarity on the truth, the opening rate fell to 39.5 (i.e., each yuan was worth 39.5 Hong Kong cents), hitting a record low. However, after news confirmed that the banks were operating as usual, the national currency looked promising and recovered to 4.49 at the noon close. The afternoon market was slightly weak, opening at 4.2 and then rising again to 42.3425. The evening close was 42.6, the same price as the previous day. As for the Guangdong currency, the opening price was 352, followed by 365, and the afternoon close was 358.

Wu Yisun Advocates: Stop Selling Foreign Exchange

The Ministry of Finance's current restriction on foreign exchange sales to consolidate finance is deemed appropriate by financial and economic experts in Hong Kong. Wu Xuanxun, vice chairman of the Hong Kong Gold and Silver Trade, even advocated stopping sales altogether. According to Wu, sales should be announced to stop in wartime, and let its price to naturally rise. If this policy were adopted, the national currency price would not have fallen to today's levels (initially, the government set the national currency price at one shilling and 25, then at eight pence and 25, and now it is set at six and a half pence). It would also minimize the import of goods, especially luxury goods. Purchases of various goods should be subject to government control, which would be more beneficial to the national economy. However, implementing this policy has one prerequisite: the personnel involved must be absolutely fair and honest to succeed," Wu said, showing no disagreement with the government's current limit on foreign exchange sales.

Fluctuations in Shanghai's Financial Circles: Exchange Market Falls and Rises Again

[Reuters Shanghai, 22nd] Shanghai's various Chinese merchant banks, on the orders of the Chongqing Ministry of Finance, have restricted withdrawals by depositors. As a result, the exchange rate of the legal tender (fa bi) against foreign currencies suddenly rose, followed by a sharp reaction. Transactions in gold bars and cotton yarn have been suspended due to a lack of cash. Stock exchanges have not been greatly affected, as those trading stocks have mostly adopted a "wait-and-see" policy, resulting in very few transactions. Today, when the market opened, the legal tender was selling at six and a half pence against the British pound and eleven-sixteenths of twelve yuan against the US dollar. Near noon, the uptrend was quite strong, with a small amount of cash transactions at a rate of seven pence against the British pound and five-eighths of thirteen yuan against the US dollar. After noon, the market situation changed again, and at the close, it was seventeen thirty-seconds of six pence against the British pound and twelve point seven five yuan against the US dollar. Because Chinese merchant banks have restricted withdrawals by depositors and money is tight, the future of the legal tender against the British pound is uncertain. The discount rate for remittance bills suddenly soared, opening at the usual six point five percent, then surging to around sixteen percent, before falling back to ten percent at the close.

### Important Statement by Ministry of Finance Spokesperson: Emergency Measures Taken to Stabilize Shanghai's Financial Market

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry has repeatedly received reports that due to the situation in Tianjin, × pseudo-elements are taking the opportunity to spread rumors, leading to deposit withdrawals and competitive purchases of foreign exchange in Shanghai, in the hopes of escaping funds and engaging in speculative profit-seeking. To stabilize Shanghai's financial market, the Ministry should take emergency measures to prevent this. On the 21st, it telegraphed the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China in Shanghai, as well as the Money Trade Association and the Chamber of Commerce, stating that starting from the 22nd of this month, withdrawals from Shanghai money businesses, except for essential government needs and wage payments, will be limited to 500 yuan per week, paid in legal tender. Amounts exceeding 500 yuan will be paid by remittance for interbank transfers only. Other ports outside of Shanghai will continue to operate as before. Those who transfer deposits to the interior will not be subject to this restriction. The above measures are temporary measures to cope with the current financial situation in Shanghai. The Ministry is confident that all sectors in Shanghai are patriotic and will fully comply with these measures.

### American Sympathy for China: Johnson's Remarks in Chongqing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] After American Ambassador Johnson arrived in Chongqing, reporters visited him this morning and had a cordial one-hour conversation. The Ambassador said that he traveled to Chongqing via the highway from Kunming through Guiyang and deeply felt that the construction of China's rear highway has made considerable progress, and the management is particularly outstanding. The anti-Japanese sentiments of the Chinese people seen along the way are very strong, which is beyond expectations. When he returned to his country last year, he had meetings with people from all walks of life in his country, and they have a clearer understanding of the Chinese issue. When he arrived in New York, even though it was only for a week, more than 130 people visited him every day, all inquiring about the situation of China's resistance. The same was true in other places, and no one did not sympathize with China's heroic resistance. In New York and Washington, he was welcomed by Chinese expatriates. Although Guangzhou and Hankou were successively lost, the assistance of overseas Chinese to their motherland has not diminished in the slightest. While in New York, the Ambassador was entertained by young overseas Chinese. These young people are actively promoting the anti-Japanese struggle for their motherland and are very active in various parts of the United States, often receiving a welcome from the majority of the audience, and the newspapers also praised them. In addition, the Ambassador also expressed his admiration for the efforts of various church groups to raise funds for China.

### British Merchants Donate Large Sums to Help China with Disaster Relief; Cooperatives in Various Places Donate Large Quantities of Goods

Rumors of Increased British Financial Aid to China

[Our Newspaper, Shanghai, 22nd] According to reliable sources, due to Japan's tough stance towards Britain, Britain's financial assistance to China is likely to expand. The British government previously requested China to increase guarantees before fully releasing the 3 million pounds of credit loan to China, but now it no longer insists.

[Reuters, London, 21st] John Swire & Sons, Ltd. of this city, has recently donated a large sum of 5,000 pounds to China for disaster relief. Cooperatives throughout Britain have also donated a large number of goods, valued at 1,000 pounds.

### League of Nations Comrades Association: Sends Telegrams to Various Countries Appealing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] The China International League of Nations Comrades Association, believing that the × bandits are at the end of their rope and are acting perversely, and recently blockaded the British and French concessions in Tianjin, harming the lives and property of foreigners, has sent telegrams to the World Federation of League of Nations Comrades Associations in Geneva, the British League of Nations Comrades Association, the French League of Nations Comrades Association, the American League of Nations Comrades Association, Sir Cecil of Britain, Sir Lytton, Mr. Herriot of France, Mr. Gout, Mr. Stimson of the United States, and Mr. Pitman, hoping to mobilize the people, urge the government, and take effective action in a timely manner to step up sanctions against Japan.

### × Demands Foreign Warships Leave Shantou: Britain and the United States Unanimously Refuse; Yan Ruhr's Attitude Firm; Some British Nationals Have Been Evacuated

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] According to foreign sources in Shantou, the Japanese naval authorities recently issued an ultimatum to the warships here, demanding that they leave Shantou by 1:00 PM today. Foreign nationals in Shantou should all evacuate on warships. After 1:00 PM today, Japan will hardly be able to guarantee the safety of foreign nationals ashore. It is reported that the British warship "Tarantula" and the American destroyer "Filesbre" are currently anchored in Shantou harbor.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] According to foreign sources in Shanghai, the ultimatum issued by the Japanese military authorities, demanding that British and American warships leave Shantou before 1:00 PM today, has been rejected by Yan Ruhr, commander of the US Far East Fleet. He stated that if the lives and property of American nationals are endangered due to the fighting in Shantou, the responsibility should be borne by the Japanese side.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] According to foreign sources in Shanghai, after the Japanese military authorities issued the ultimatum, the two British ships in Shantou have been prepared to carry the women and children of British nationals residing in Shantou, as well as nationals of other countries staying in Shantou, to other places. It is scheduled to depart this afternoon. As for the British and American warships anchored in Shantou harbor, they have all refused to move. The British naval authorities have stated that in order to protect British interests in Shantou, British warships cannot leave.

Tianjin: British Military Strength Increased; American Losses Not Insignificant

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd] According to foreign sources in Tianjin, a company of British soldiers arrived here yesterday by train from Beiping, Shanhaiguan, Beidaihe, and Qinhuangdao. As a result, the strength of the garrison in the British Concession in Tianjin has been further enhanced. It was previously rumored that the Japanese side intended to suddenly attack the British Concession, and British nationals were very disturbed when they heard the news. The Board of Works has now decided to step up various precautionary measures. In addition, the Japanese side continues to discriminate against British nationals in Tianjin, and the resentment of British nationals is increasing.

[Tianjin, 22nd] According to foreign sources, since the Japanese military blockaded Tianjin, the losses of Americans in Tianjin have amounted to 90,000 US dollars. Germans in the area have also expressed dissatisfaction with the Japanese authorities, saying that the Japanese side does not treat Germans as well as Americans, which is not in line with the German-Japanese axis.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] According to sources in Tianjin, 100 British women and children took a boat to Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe, and other places this morning. They all traveled by car from the British Concession to Tanggu, and then changed to a British ship. The Japanese side did not interfere with this.

Haimen: × Spokesperson's Remarks: Prohibition of Ship Navigation

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 21st] According to sources in Shanghai, a Japanese naval spokesperson said at a press conference this afternoon that the Japanese military has banned all ships from sailing in Haimen because Chinese guerrillas have recently been found there.

### Remarks by a Deputy Commander-in-Chief of a Certain War Zone on the Battle Situation in Southeastern Shanxi

[Newsletter from the Min Ge She (Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang)] After the news of the promotion of a certain commander-in-chief of a certain group army to concurrently serve as a deputy commander-in-chief of a certain war zone spread, the reporter specially ventured forward to ask about the recent aspects of the war of resistance in North China.

When the reporter entered the deputy commander-in-chief's office, he was reading a manual on infantry combat regulations. When he saw me enter, he closed it and placed it aside, receiving the reporter very modestly. The reporter first raised the question of "opinions on the past and future of a certain war zone." The commander responded with a calm and firm tone: "In the past, under the leadership of the commander-in-chief of the self-defense war zone, all aspects of the government, military, and people were very united. Everyone jointly dealt with the × people, the people also loved the army very much, and the regular army and guerrillas also had good cooperation. The government was run by some promising young people, the people also had organizations, and progress was very rapid in all aspects. We are very supportive of all of this, and now and in the future, we will still support these progressive plans and implement these plans."

"In a certain war zone, there are often more than 100,000 × people, but we can still plan so closely and fight so bravely, annihilating many × people everywhere. This proves that we will definitely be able to counterattack and achieve final victory."

"The cooperation between the government, military, and people in a certain war zone is a model for the whole country. Commander Yan is a great anti-Japanese leader in the country, and he is always generous to his subordinates, so we believe that various plans can be protected and implemented."

Secondly, the question was asked about "the × people's attempt to invade Southeastern Shanxi this time and our task of defending the Great Northwest."

Answer: "According to our estimate, the × people's invasion of Southeastern Shanxi this time is their last battle of 'mopping up' North China. In order to invade the Great Northwest, the × people must first invade Southern Shanxi. To invade Southern Shanxi, they must first 'mop up' the anti-Japanese bases in the Hebei Plain and Jin-Cha-Ji (Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei), so we must defend Southeastern Shanxi and insist on guerrilla warfare on the Hebei Plain, so that they cannot smoothly carry out their plans anywhere, dispersing and containing their forces, so that they cannot smoothly invade Southeastern Shanxi, and at the same time, defending Southeastern Shanxi will also break their attempt to invade the Great Northwest, fulfilling our task of defending the Great Northwest."

"We believe that if the government, military, and people of North China can all resolutely deal with the × people, we are confident in persisting in the war of resistance in North China, and the Great Northwest can also be defended."

Question: "What is the situation and characteristics of the × people's deployment for this invasion of Southeastern Shanxi?"

Answer: "This time, the × people are using more troops and more cautiously to invade Southeastern Shanxi than last time, and there are more routes of invasion. According to current estimates, the × people have deployed their forces to attack Southeastern Shanxi at various points along the surrounding railways: Daqing, Pinghan, Zhengtai, and Tongpu, gradually advancing along the road, adopting a steady and solid advance. In combat, they adopt the method of using superior forces to surround and outflank occupied points. After occupying a certain point, they intensify the construction of roads and bunkers to facilitate rear communication and consolidate the stronghold, sending troops to clear the area and deceive the people, and carrying out political conspiracies."

"Because Southeastern Shanxi is mountainous, it is more difficult for the × people to use rapid troops, so they will inevitably use more airplanes to bomb, first bombing every city and town, and gradually bombing every major village. Moreover, when the war becomes protracted in the future, they will often use large amounts of poison gas, which we must guard against. But no matter how brutal the × people are, they still have difficulties that they cannot overcome. The main one is the lack of troops. The × people must use several times our forces to attack us. Although there are now six or seven divisions transferred around, it is still not enough to allocate. Secondly, there is no popular base and no help, and supplies are very difficult."

Question: "What is our task under the emergency situation in Southeastern Shanxi?"

Answer: "Under this emergency situation, on the military side, everyone must work hard to kill ×, unite, and skillfully use the terrain and the power of the masses to cooperate with our flexible tactics to eliminate the × people. On the administrative side, governments at all levels must lead the broad masses to cooperate with the military in combat, whether it is reconnaissance of the × people, clearing out traitors, providing food, emptying the villages, destroying roads, blocking our news, leading the way for our army, etc., the government must have detailed plans, lead the masses to carry out the work in a self-sacrificing manner, and help in the battle. In times of difficulty, the government will work with the guerrillas, and in any protracted and arduous struggle, it must still carry out its own tasks. On the part of the masses, this war mainly depends on the masses to win victory. The broad masses should not only help the army, but also widely mobilize the masses of guerrillas, and cooperate with the army in a planned way, and carry out automatic warfare in a planned way. Every village should organize guerrilla groups, in groups of three and clusters of five, to contain the × people, fatigue the × people, first carry out road destruction to cut off traffic, and launch and implement the emptying of the villages. At this time, it is also necessary to produce a large amount, and mass organizations must lead in preparing to subsidize the army's use. In any case, it is also necessary to step up spring plowing and future harvesting, and participate in combat in the most emergency to win the final victory. As for public opinion, the main task is to expose the deception and conspiracy propaganda of the × people. We regard all kinds of propaganda of the × people as theories of national subjugation and race extermination. We use public opinion to promote the unity of the people and prevent traitors from implementing their conspiracies. The power of propaganda enables compatriots from all walks of life to truly unite to support the government, support Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and support the commander-in-chief of the self-defense war zone, encourage all troops to fight, and also print a lot of leaflets and slogans to mobilize the broad masses, so that the masses can play a great role in the war of resistance."

Then, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief replied to the reporter's estimate of the × people's invasion of Southeastern Shanxi this time:

"Although the × people have used great strength to invade us, it is possible to defeat the encirclement of the × people with the united and planned counterattack of our military and civilians in Southeastern Shanxi. We have good terrain conditions and mass base, which are the most powerful guarantees for defeating the encirclement of the × people."

"Of course, the × people will do their best to occupy some cities, destroy some of our material construction, and may also send some weaker guards to make long-term occupation attempts, so we estimate that this time is a long-term war, but as long as we persist in developing extensive guerrilla warfare and eliminating a large amount of the × people's manpower and material resources, the × people will still have to retreat to within the main railway lines, so the military and civilians of Southeastern Shanxi must unite and use all their strength to eliminate the × people's plan to invade Southeastern Shanxi this time."

Finally, the question was asked: "What is the outlook for defending the Great Northwest?"

He replied: "It is very likely that the Great Northwest can be defended. The main thing to defend the Great Northwest is to persist in the war of resistance in North China. As long as the government, military, and people of the Great Northwest can use all their strength to assist the troops and people resisting in North China, then the Great Northwest can naturally be safe in our rear."

"However, there are some people who do not understand the situation on the front line, and they are still talking about a set of great principles in the rear, and they do not come to help the front line of the war of resistance, but they are creating friction there. Now we very much hope that the government, military, and people of the Great Northwest will unite to assist the front line of the war of resistance. The future of the Great Northwest is very bright and good. Even if the Great Northwest is attacked, we are still in the rear of the × people. The deeper the × people go, the better the opportunity for us to encircle and annihilate the × people. We must never miss this opportunity."

The Commander ended this conversation with such powerful words, and the reporter left contentedly.

### British Response to the Tianjin Incident: Still Willing to Resolve Locally; If Japan Continues to Act Recklessly, Britain Will Consider Retaliatory Action

(Reuters, London, 22nd) According to sources within official circles here, the British government, while willing to resolve the current situation in Tianjin based on local events, will be forced to take corresponding steps to protect its interests if the current situation persists. The British government previously inquired about the Japanese government's attitude towards the blockade of Tianjin, but has not yet received a reply from Tokyo. The British government is now striving to move these negotiations from Tianjin to Tokyo.

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] The Cabinet held a meeting at 10:30 this morning to review the international situation, paying particular attention to the Anglo-Japanese dispute. Reports from diplomatic representatives stationed in the Far East were presented for discussion. It is widely believed that since the British side has already made suggestions to the Japanese side, advocating that the Tianjin incident should be resolved as a local matter, the Cabinet will not make any new decisions until the Japanese side responds.

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] The Tianjin incident was brought up for discussion during the Cabinet's regular weekly meeting this morning. Regarding this matter, the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has held talks with the Japanese Foreign Minister, Hachiro Arita. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax also met with the Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Mamoru Shigemitsu, to convey the British government's views. The British are now awaiting a response from the Japanese side. Therefore, the Cabinet has not yet made any decisions regarding the implementation of economic sanctions against Japan. The news of the Japanese army's attack on Shantou at this juncture has created a bad impression and caused considerable concern.

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] The Cabinet held its regular weekly meeting on the morning of the 21st, immediately studying the report submitted by the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, following his meeting with the Japanese Foreign Minister yesterday. The Foreign Secretary then reported on his conversation with the Japanese Ambassador, Mamoru Shigemitsu, yesterday. It is understood that the Foreign Secretary stated that there is still hope for a locally-based solution to the Tianjin incident. Therefore, the implementation of economic sanctions against Japan should be delayed for a few days. However, if Ambassador Craigie's renewed meeting with Arita proves that there is no hope for a satisfactory agreement on the Tianjin incident, the British government will definitely take action. Although several cabinet members expressed opposition to this, domestic public opinion is extremely agitated against Japan. Therefore, if the current negotiations fail, those cabinet members will undoubtedly change their minds, and the Cabinet will definitely implement sanctions, it can be asserted.

(Reuters, London, 21st) In response to supplementary questions about the Far East situation in the House of Commons today, Chamberlain said that if Japan has any grievances, he hoped it would state them specifically. Chamberlain later replied to Eden's inquiry, saying that Ambassador Craigie had clearly stated that the British government could not condone Japan's blockade and was preparing to take all necessary steps to ensure that the British people in the concession were not short of supplies. When asked if the government had considered transporting food by air, Chamberlain replied that the whole situation was under consideration.

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] The Prime Minister reported on the situation in Tianjin in the House of Commons on the 21st, saying that it was still difficult to understand what attitude the Japanese government held on various key issues. It has also not been decided whether this issue will be discussed in Tokyo or Tianjin. It is hoped that a report will be received today or tomorrow. Member of Parliament, Mr. Tan Halle, followed up with a question, stating that British nationals in Tianjin have been subjected to numerous acts of violence. Has the government received reports of this? The Prime Minister replied in the affirmative. Mr. Halle then asked whether the government had taken any action. The Prime Minister replied that this matter had been raised in negotiations. Opposition Labour Party MP, Mr. Henderson, then asked the Prime Minister whether what he had just said meant that the Japanese government had not clearly stated its grievances to Britain. If so, then it would not be too difficult to conduct negotiations. The Prime Minister replied that Britain hopes the Japanese authorities will explain what their grievances are. Conservative MP and former Foreign Secretary Eden then asked whether the British government did not intend to condone the Japanese military's blockade of the British concession and was prepared to take necessary measures to ensure the supply of food to British nationals there, and whether Ambassador Craigie had explained this to the Japanese Foreign Minister during their talks yesterday. The Prime Minister replied in the affirmative, stating that the blockade was definitely not something that Britain could condone, and that Ambassador Craigie had clearly stated this. Subsequently, Conservative MP, Mr. Heneage, asked whether it was true that Japanese nationals in British colonies could now have their jobs taken over by Indians. The Prime Minister did not answer. Communist MP, Mr. Gallacher, then asked whether the British government was prepared to negotiate with the Japanese side before they lifted the blockade. The Prime Minister again did not answer. Conservative MP, Mr. Adams, then asked whether the British government had considered using airplanes to transport food to the Tianjin concession. The Prime Minister replied that the whole situation was under consideration, and that the question was where the food would come from.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 21st] According to some newspapers in Paris, the United States is paying even more attention to the Tianjin incident than is being reported. *Le Figaro* stated that the United States is actually closely watching the situation in Tianjin. After the European War, Britain abandoned the Anglo-Japanese alliance to show goodwill to the United States, and the United States cannot forget this point. *Le Temps* stated that the representations made by the United States to Tokyo were worded very strongly. Other newspapers stated that the responsibility of the French people is very simple: we should fully support our British friends.

[Central News Agency, Sydney, 21st] Australia is currently closely watching the situation in Tianjin, as the authorities here are holding negotiations with the Japanese side to conclude a short-term trade agreement, and Japan purchased approximately £6 million worth of goods from Australia last year. However, according to *The Sydney Morning Herald*, if Britain deems it necessary to impose economic retaliation against Japan, Australia must support it. If Britain's position in the Far East is undermined, its impact on Australia will be greater than on any other part of the British Empire.

### British Foreign Secretary's Speech: Deplores Britain's Situation; Does Not Believe Japan Intends to Provoke; Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Will Be Completed

(Reuters, London, 22nd) British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax spoke in London today, addressing the Tianjin issue, saying that he dared not readily believe that the Tokyo government would resolutely provoke Britain's entire position and policy. On the contrary, he believed that the current situation seemed to be due to misinterpretations or differences in opinion. Halifax continued, "There are those who urge us to take action, but based on the current facts, we are unable to accept it. If the Japanese government were in our place, they might feel justified in launching such actions. Therefore, seeing that we have taken no action, they would be perplexed by our refusal to comply with their request, and would say that the reason we refuse is that we intend to harm their interests. But regardless of the general judgment of the British people on the China situation, from the British standpoint, we have never condoned anyone using Tianjin as a base of operations, and we have no intention of harming Japan's military interests. If we can get Japan to truly believe this point, and provide evidence to clarify that its repeated statements have no intention of undermining British interests in the Far East, then there is hope for a resolution of this incident. Not long ago, we deeply believed that we could have at least a few months of peace, but this is not the case. Just when a more peaceful policy is needed to break the deadlock, new complications arise, adding to our concerns and confusion." After briefly stating the recent policy of seeking to unite all countries willing to uphold the rule of law to oppose the lawless elements of Europe, Halifax then reported on the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, saying: "We firmly believe that the concerns and objectives of the Soviet government are no different from our own. The only difficulty lies in finding a proper way, but I absolutely believe that we will be able to reach an agreement. We have worked and progressed harder than anyone else in seeking an agreement. The reason it has not been achieved so far is simply that we have repeatedly tried to persuade others to participate in constructive steps to consolidate the foundations of peace on the basis of mutual effort. If all the efforts we have made to improve relations are unfortunately regarded as weakness, and are used to launch new invasions, then what the warmongers can understand is that others will also defend themselves strongly with force. We have long anticipated that various vile means will be constantly used to weaken the resolve of the British people, but these means will fail. The British people have reached a stage where the permanent foreign policy of Britain contains three important factors: (1) The strength of national unity is unprecedented in recent years; (2) The nation has clearly understood the goals of its national policy; (3) It is clear that the country is strong and is becoming stronger. More than anything else, I firmly believe that if the British people can remain true to their own spirit of freedom, they can work for the freedom of the world." Churchill spoke before Halifax, declaring that no one could foresee when the world's peace and freedom would be struck again, but he firmly believed that if there were any more acts of unwarranted aggression, the entire British Empire would resist with all its might, and three-quarters of humanity on Earth would respond. Churchill went on to praise the Foreign Secretary, saying, "Although we have different points of view, we all accept the policies that you and Prime Minister Chamberlain have just declared. Even if there are disagreements, they are only minor issues of degree and timing. The increase in British strength and preparedness is not only a real help to Foreign Secretary Halifax, but also an important factor for world peace. On the other hand, the whole situation has become chaotic, and the balance of Europe has been greatly changed to Britain's disadvantage. Other countries have also worked hard to prepare, so I feel that the policy I advocated last year may not still prevent war, but I still believe that policy can give us the best chance to prevent war, and at the same time, if war cannot be avoided, it can give us the best chance to win. But I would like to offer one reservation: At this time, 'half measures' cannot be tolerated. If an Anglo-Soviet agreement cannot be reached, there is no hope for the consolidation of Eastern Europe, and even if there is, it will not last long."

### British King Returns Home: Grand Welcome from the Nation

(Reuters, London, 22nd) As the British King and Queen are about to arrive here, preparations have been made for a grand welcome. Countless people will be waiting for the King and Queen in Southampton, and the people of London will also gather to welcome them. The King and Queen will drive directly from Waterloo Station to Buckingham Palace. The first to welcome the King and Queen will be the two princesses, who left Buckingham Palace this morning for Portsmouth, to board a destroyer to welcome the King and Queen. The "Queen Mary" will be escorted into Southampton Harbour by the warships "Southampton" and "Glasgow" and airplanes. The domestic fleet will fire salutes. Queen Mary and many other members of the royal family will be waiting in Southampton. The King and his party will arrive in London at 4:52 PM. The Prime Minister, cabinet members, and other prominent figures will be waiting there.

(Reuters, London, 22nd) The "Queen Mary" arrived in Southampton at 2:50 PM and berthed at the dock. Queen Mary, the Duchess of Gloucester, the Duchess of Kent, Harry Woodburn, and the commander of the British Navy all boarded the ship. The King and Queen disembarked at 3:20 PM.

### Germany and Italy Reach Naval Agreement: Contents Not Yet Disclosed

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st] Italian Undersecretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Domenico Cavagnari, at the invitation of German Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Admiral Erich Raeder, came to Germany to discuss naval cooperation between the two countries, and has now completed his mission, according to the semi-official German News Agency. The two sides have reached a complete agreement.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 20th] Italian Undersecretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Domenico Cavagnari, at the invitation of German Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Admiral Erich Raeder, came to Germany to discuss naval cooperation between the two countries. The two sides began talks this afternoon in Friedrichshafen, on the shores of Lake Constance. Naval staff officers also participated in the talks.

(Reuters, Berlin, 21st) The German-Italian naval talks were completed today. According to a published communique, the two navies' views are in complete agreement, and both sides are satisfied.

### Hitler to Give Another Speech

[Central News Agency, Berlin, 21st] Germany's fifth 10,000-ton cruiser is scheduled to be launched on July 1 in Bremen. At that time, Hitler will deliver an important speech on the international situation.

### Anglo-German Discord: Mutual Demands for the Recall of Consuls

(Reuters, Berlin, 21st) Germany has requested that the British government recall the British Consul General in Vienna. Britain recently requested that the German government recall the German Consul General in Liverpool because the consul was linked to a spy. Germany's action is clearly a retaliatory move. The German government also issued a statement saying, "The German government has learned that the British Consul General in Vienna is involved in leaking prohibited information, and therefore requests that the British government recall the Consul General." However, according to information obtained by Reuters' diplomatic correspondent in London, the British Consul General in Vienna has not been charged, as London officials consider the German allegations to be absolutely unfounded.

### Spain Denies Military Agreement with the Axis Powers

[Central News Agency, Paris, 20th] Spanish Ambassador Lequerica met with Foreign Minister Bonnet this morning to deny the statement made by the Spanish Air Force Commander, General Alfredo Kindelán, in the Italian press, endorsing a military agreement between Spain and the Axis powers. Bonnet then received the French Ambassador to Spain, Philippe Pétain. In addition, the French Resident-General in Morocco, Charles Noguès, also met with Bonnet to report on the relationship between the French and Spanish Moroccan protectorates in North Africa, which has recently improved.

### The Baltic Sea and Northern Europe (Part II)

— Dong Ping

An Analysis of the Sticking Points in the Anglo-Soviet Negotiations

First, she has built the Stalin Canal—connecting the Baltic Sea and the White Sea, a total of 142 miles, with a normal voyage of five and a half days. This way, the Soviet fleet can bypass the Sound and freely enter and exit the Baltic Sea here.

Second, she hopes to obtain military control over the three Baltic states, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. These three small countries are close to the Soviet Union's western border. If they unfortunately fall into the hands of the Nazis—the trend is already very dangerous—the Soviet Union and Ukraine will be attacked from both sides.

Therefore, in the Anglo-Soviet talks, the Soviet Union is determined to demand guarantees for the three Baltic states. The significance of this is the same as demanding guarantees for Poland and Romania, and its importance is even greater, because that way her forces can be pushed to the sea, forming a strategic stronghold with the Gulf of Finland.

Three

Now, let's take a look at why Britain refuses to guarantee the Baltic states.

First, we must state that we are not defeatists, but we are by no means optimists. We hope that the Anglo-Soviet negotiations will be successful soon; but as a matter of fact, we cannot say that they are already completed.

Why is Britain unwilling to guarantee the Baltic Sea? To sum it up in one sentence, Britain, no, it should be said that the British government does not have the sincerity to join hands with the Soviet Union.

Mr. Chamberlain, seeing that Hitler was acting too outrageously, invited Stalin out to bolster his position, with the aim of scaring Hitler and then bargaining. As a matter of fact, when the Anglo-Soviet negotiations were in full swing, Mr. Chamberlain said in the House of Commons: "The Imperial government is still willing to make peace with Germany."

Britain may be able to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union, but it would only be a piece of paper. Mr. Chamberlain will not allow Britain to be bound militarily, creating a truly so-called "encirclement of Germany."

Don't you know? To defeat the left neighbor and suppress the right neighbor is called maintaining the balance of power—the traditional policy of a great power.

Four

Why do the three Baltic states also oppose accepting guarantees and want to maintain neutrality? This is a lie. There is no such thing as neutrality in the world. Neutrality is a synonym for fence-sitting.

The three small Baltic states are in an extremely difficult position, caught between two forces. The only way is to sit on the fence. Of course, they also understand that if the war really breaks out, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, the United States and other countries will work together, and the Axis will be doomed. But now, so-and-so is still flirting with Hitler, who wants to offend people!

If Britain is willing to come forward and guarantee the three countries, there will be no problem. Because the three small countries themselves produce very little, they all have good trade agreements with Britain, and in some ways, they are still British vassals. However, Mr. So-and-so has seen the guns on the western border of Denmark, and thinks it is better to keep the peace.

Soviet newspapers say that the three Baltic states originally had no objection to the guarantees, but the British government sent someone to imply that they should raise objections, and Britain said: "Since people don't want guarantees, why force them to want them?"; this may not be completely unfounded.

We remember that Poland and Romania also did not want Soviet guarantees at first, but later they did; it is said that this was thanks to Britain's "persuasion"!

Five

Finally, we want to say that whether the Anglo-Soviet negotiations are truly successful depends on Mr. Chamberlain.

### Anglo-Soviet Negotiations: Still No Agreement; Britain to Send Cabinet Member to the Soviet Union; Resist Germany's Inducements

(Reuters, Moscow, 21st) British and French representatives held a meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov tonight, lasting two hours. The next talks will continue in a day or two.

(Reuters, Paris, 21st) A communique was issued after the French Cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee meeting today, stating that some points in the draft treaty of the three countries submitted by British representative William Strang to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov have been agreed upon. French Foreign Minister Bonnet stated at the meeting that there were still difficulties in the current Anglo-French talks with the Soviet Union, because some countries, due to their special circumstances, had not requested guarantees. However, the talks are continuing in a good atmosphere to obtain the necessary clarifications. In addition, Bonnet also reported that the Franco-Turkish agreement was about to be signed.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, the TASS news agency has issued a message stating that the recent suggestions made by the United Kingdom and France are not sufficient to constitute progress from the Soviet point of view.

[Central News Agency, London, 21st] During the House of Commons meeting on the afternoon of the 21st, several members asked whether the government had consulted the Soviet government on the situation in China. Chamberlain replied in the negative. Opposition Labour Party MP, Mr. Wedgwood, then raised an inquiry, stating that the news that came in this morning was quite serious, and asked whether the Prime Minister could allow the British General Staff to hold talks with the Soviet General Staff as soon as possible to supplement the mission of William Strang, Head of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office. The Prime Minister replied that this could only be implemented after the Anglo-Soviet agreement was reached. Liberal MP, Mr. Mander, then asked whether the agreement to be concluded between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union would be extended to the Far East. Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Butler, replied in the negative, and said that the current negotiations were limited to Europe, and the Soviet side had not raised the question of expanding the scope of the agreement. To promote the current negotiations, the United Kingdom intends to send a cabinet member to Moscow.

[Central News Agency, London, 20th] Sources close to the government here recently stated that the negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union have now entered a decisive stage. This is because the Cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee, when discussing the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic states this morning, decided to accept France's suggestion that if the vital interests of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union are threatened, the other two countries should provide mutual assistance. This suggestion differs from what Molotov proposed by only one point: the Soviet Union insisted that the names of the Baltic states should be explicitly mentioned, while the United Kingdom and France suggested that they should be omitted. In addition, various minor issues, such as the Soviet Union's request to immediately hold General Staff talks, have been resolved. The British government has ordered its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir William Seeds, to step up negotiations in the hope of reaching an agreement as soon as possible. According to reliable sources in Berlin and Moscow, Germany is tempting the Soviet Union to maintain a neutral position with the bait of concluding a non-aggression treaty, a commercial agreement, and even establishing a Locarno Pact for the Baltic Sea. However, it is heard that Hitler still suspects the Soviet Union, and is only allowing Ribbentrop to try to break through the "Eastern European Front" with diplomatic tactics. The suggestions made by Germany to the Soviet Union are only informal, and the Soviet Union has not expressed its position except to put them on record. Therefore, the British government is eager to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union to prevent Germany from reaping the benefits.

Franco-Turkish Agreement to Be Signed Today

[Central News Agency, Paris, 21st] According to information obtained by reporters from diplomatic circles, the Franco-Turkish agreement will be signed this Friday. The part of the agreement concerning mutual assistance when a Western country is subjected to armed aggression will be signed in Paris, while the part concerning France's cession of the Sanjak of Alexandretta will be signed in Ankara. The agreement had been stalled, and it is fortunate that it has now been completed. Therefore, people here are all delighted and rejoicing upon hearing the news.

[Central News Agency, Ankara, Turkey, 21st] Regarding the issue of the Sanjak region of the Syrian Republic being incorporated into Turkish territory, representatives of France and Turkey yesterday reached an agreement. After the text of the agreement has been finalized, it will be announced on the 22nd or 23rd of this month. The committee established by the Turkish government has also drafted a merger plan, which will be submitted to Parliament for discussion in the shortest possible time.

### Anglo-French Military Conference Commences, Subcommittees in Secret Discussions Focusing on Addressing the Japanese Navy

[Reuters, Singapore, 21st] Representatives attending the Anglo-French Singapore "International Joint Defense Conference" have all arrived. Indian Air Force Commander Sir John Babington and Major General Marriott arrived tonight. Lieutenant Colonel Henderson, Deputy Director of Tactical Intelligence of the British Indian Army, has also arrived in Singapore. The gymnasium at the Manchester Regiment camp will serve as the venue for the plenary session. However, the Army, Navy, and Air Force subcommittees will meet separately during most of the conference period. The general meeting will commence as scheduled to consolidate the conclusions of the various subcommittees. Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British China Fleet, will serve as chairman. Absolute secrecy will be maintained regarding the proceedings of the conference. Security around the conference venue is currently being tightened. Countries worldwide, especially Germany and Japan, are expressing great interest in this conference.

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 22nd] Generals from both Britain and France participating in the Singapore Anglo-French military conference have arrived successively. Admiral Noble, Commander of the British Far East Fleet, will chair the meeting. Discussions will be highly confidential, and the surrounding area will be closely guarded to prevent any unexpected incidents. Countries around the world are paying close attention to the Singapore conference, especially Germany and Japan. Important personnel from the French side participating in the conference include the Commander-in-Chief of the French Far East Fleet, the Commander of the French Annam Garrison, and the Chief of Staff of the French Air Force.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 22nd] According to the "L'Intransigeant" newspaper here, the Anglo-French General Staffs are meeting in Singapore, and it is expected that the outcome will include the organization of a joint Anglo-French military headquarters in the Far East. A new headquarters will be established, and a British officer will serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the Anglo-French forces in the Far East. The military supplies used by the troops of both countries will be jointly planned. The plan to deal with the Japanese naval invasion will prepare for the eventuality of war with Japan. The plans include leveraging Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam and the Singapore naval base to protect British and French concessions in China, methods to safeguard British and French merchant ships at sea in the Far East, and maintaining transportation routes with Siam, the Dutch East Indies, and the United States.

Brief Commentary

### New Regulations Restricting Foreign Exchange

According to news from Hong Kong, our government has already promulgated new regulations restricting foreign exchange. The fixed amount for selling foreign exchange is 500 yuan, and any amount exceeding this requires submitting an application stating sufficient reasons. At the same time, Chinese banks in Shanghai have also been ordered to restrict withdrawals, with a weekly withdrawal limit of 500 yuan.

Upon seeing this news, whether for the sake of the country or for one's own sake, if one is a patriotic and farsighted compatriot, one cannot but rejoice for the future victory of the nation and the people. This new regulation is a countermeasure to crush the financial conspiracy of the Japanese × and Chinese traitors, and a key strategy to consolidate the country's financial health and wartime finance. For genuinely patriotic compatriots, this not only causes no inconvenience to their property but also provides an additional layer of protection.

Of course, this new regulation will also cause discomfort and resentment among some, leading them to spread rumors and incite unrest. These are the Japanese invaders, the running dogs raised by the Japanese ×, the leaders of the traitors and the ilk of Wang Jingwei, and some unscrupulous, short-sighted money-grubbers and speculators, because all their conspiracies and evil tricks will face greater difficulties.

We should not only sincerely support this new regulation restricting foreign exchange, but also hope that the government and financial leaders can further effectively achieve complete control of foreign exchange and foreign trade, and can further cooperate with friendly foreign banks to encourage and compel foreign exchange holders to sell.

In order to defeat the Japanese invaders financially, and for the sake of everyone's future genuine peace and happiness, our compatriots, and even our friendly nations, will surely be happy to complete this great task!

### Locking the Stable Door After the Horse Has Bolted: British House of Commons Questions Submarine Rescue Equipment

[Reuters, London, 21st] In the British House of Commons today, someone questioned what equipment Singapore and the Chinese naval base have for rescuing submarine accidents. Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, Shakespeare, replied that Singapore and Hong Kong have some dockyards and various tugs, barges, and other equipment that can be used for rescuing submarines in distress.

The Battle of Shantou has begun. The × authorities have actually demanded that British and American warships and merchant ships of third countries all withdraw from Shantou before 1:00 PM on the 22nd. There are too many countries that cherish peace, and the × people are becoming increasingly arrogant. 1:00 PM this afternoon has already passed, and there is no news yet. Let's see, this time, who will return the favor?

The British House of Commons is in session. Mr. Acland questioned the Tianjin incident, asking if the British government is prepared to transport food by plane to the Tianjin concession. Mr. Acland, brave are your words! However, we don't know how many planes will be used to carry out this "great task." Because, within the concession, there are British, Americans, French, and even more Chinese, tens of thousands of them, who can starve to death?

The student unrest at Diocesan Boys' School, through the great efforts of Mr. He Minghua, Mr. Luo Zhaohe, and Mr. Shi Yulin, two solutions were proposed: abolish the Taiwanese class monitors and allow students to return to school on their own. As a result, the headmaster could not accept them. As for how this matter will develop, we can only say, stay tuned for the next installment.

The night before last, on Connaught Road, there was also a robbery. After the robbery, the bandits also had lookouts to intimidate people and prevent them from reporting to the police. This is called division of labor and cooperation, a super-scientific robbery method.

On a street in Berlin, two Nazi beggars had a dispute over the difference between capitalism and National Socialism. Therefore, this question could only be asked of the multi-talented Minister of Propaganda, Dr. Goebbels. Dr. Goebbels began to propagandize: "The difference is too obvious. Do you see that woman on the street wearing a mink coat? That is capitalism; if every woman in Germany had a mink coat, that would be National Socialism."

"Hmm!" The two beggars seemed to be insufficiently educated.

"What, you still don't understand?" Dr. Goebbels continued to teach patiently, "Let me give you another analogy: do you see that person sitting in the car over there? That is also capitalism, but if every German had a car, that would be National Socialism, understand?"

"Ah! I understand!" one beggar exclaimed in sudden enlightenment. "Report, Minister, for example, if he and I are beggars, that is capitalism; if the Führer, the ministers, and every German become beggars, that would be National Socialism."

### A Strange Sight in Kunming: White Ants

A huge building, proportionally, is dozens of times higher than the tallest skyscraper in New York. The climate inside is warm in winter and cool in summer, like spring all year round. The interior equipment is complete, with air conditioners, storage rooms, cemeteries, and breeding gardens, all available. Outside, there are also police and soldiers maintaining traffic and guarding.

Don't misunderstand, this is not a dream, or a prediction of some ten thousand year evolution. It's real. In Africa, there are already many such cities. Not only now, but they existed ten thousand years ago. The city is inhabited by a group of small insects—white ants.

White ants are probably the strangest insect in the world. When our ancestors were still hanging by their tails and doing somersaults on branches, they already knew how to build modern cities. Now, if they were to organize a united front or something and resist us humans, we might still be ashamed of being inferior.

White ant cities, like India, are divided into many classes, including worker ants, soldier ants, police ants, winged ants, and the king and queen.

Worker ants are the most important group. As the name suggests, they are responsible for all the work. Cleaning, cultivating, and building are all their responsibilities. They even have to digest other people's food for them. But unfortunately, these hard-working and capable creatures suffer from a defect: they have no vision, no wings, no pincers, and no sexual desire. Soldier ants are also neuter, cannot fly, and are blind, but they have several pairs of sharp pincers, which can be used to attack people or protect themselves. Police ants are also blind, but they manage the worker ants in an orderly manner.

Winged white ants seem to be particularly blessed, actually having vision. But their only task is to propagate. At one time, millions of winged ants flew out of their city to mate. Before mating, they tore off all their wings and slowly began to walk on the lawn. Unfortunately, they were spotted by a group of crows, eagles, beasts, and Africans, and a great massacre ensued. In a few minutes, only three or five pairs of white ants survived out of millions. Fortunately, they are famous for their reproduction, and soon those three or five pairs turned into three or five cities.

Now let's talk about the king and queen, they are really a pair of pitiful insects. The queen ant is almost 15,000 times larger than the worker ants, but she has neither the power of a queen nor the ability to give orders. She can only spend her days laying eggs, one per second, 26 million a year. This output cannot be discounted, otherwise the ant citizens will let her starve to death. The king ant is even smaller, only one two-hundredth the size of the queen ant, and is a character who is always abandoned on the sidelines and no one cares about.

The life of white ants is strangely short, born in the morning and dying in the evening, just like the customs of the Africans. The dead become the main food for the living, which is of course not enough, so the worker ants take on the responsibility of foraging.

Because they are afraid of light, worker ants always build tunnels to pass through, and they use complete traffic rules in the tunnels. Those going out walk on the right, and those coming in walk on the left. When they encounter a road that is too narrow for two-way traffic, they will build a detour on the side. When building the road, if they realize that there is someone coming, they will give way to the detour to wait for "passing cars." Isn't this as smart as us humans?

Speaking of their food, except for metal, stone, and cement, they probably have no taboos. Wood, clothes, trees, and grass are all welcome. If they once favor your mansion and stay at the door for a while, then the door will fall apart like snowflakes, and soon it will be hollowed out. Furniture, doors, windows, and gangplanks will all be treated in the same way.

The only enemy that white ants share is the black ant of the same species. Simone Su Zhini said it very clearly in his book "The World of Elephants." When a team of black ants comes to invade, the white ant guards will rush out of the city gate to resist, and a shocking battle will follow. Either the blacks die and the whites live, or the blacks live and the whites die, or perhaps both sides will be injured. During the fierce battle, if the guards are about to lose, the worker ants in the city will block the mouth of the city and defend to the death, letting the soldier ants sacrifice gloriously on the battlefield, killing themselves to achieve benevolence. How smart is this!

You may feel that black ants are too cruel, why do they always invade others? But then again, if white ants did not encounter this opponent, and let them dominate the world, what a catastrophe that would be? Life, culture, everything would probably be destroyed.

If you ask who the leader is among the white ants, that is hard to say. The king and queen are clearly a pair of useless fellows, but who is actually controlling this group? I think, let's leave it to them.

### Tidbits

Old Li has always had a large appetite. In the school cafeteria, he is the first to enter and always the last to leave. Once, when all the other students had finished eating and left, the cook came to collect the cups and plates, but he was still sitting high and chewing. The cook stood and watched him, waiting for him to finish this bowl of rice. He was a little embarrassed by this glaring supervisor, but there was no reason to sacrifice his stomach. He frowned and came up with a plan. He took the empty bowl and asked the cook:

"Guess, will I have another serving?"

"I guess you won't have another serving!"

"You guessed wrong, I will have another serving."

After filling the bowl with rice, he finished it in three or two mouthfuls.

"Guess again, will I have another serving?"

"This, you won't have another serving, right?"

"You're wrong again, I still want another serving."

The wind swept away the fallen leaves, and this bowl was again facing the sky. He raised the bowl, but hadn't yet opened his mouth.

"No need to ask, I guess you still want another serving." The cook got angry.

"That's right, you finally guessed right this time."

"Hey, eat two more mouthfuls, and I'll go next door to borrow two basins."

### Maritime Storms, Episode 20

—By Captain Lawton, translated by Yang Bi

Previous Summary: In the autumn of 1914, the German ship "Kronberg," carrying six million gold bars, sailed from New York to Germany. Jack, the wireless operator of the Cox Company, and Bill, the mechanic, also took this ship to travel to Europe. On the ship, they received news that Britain and Germany had declared war, and a British warship was coming to intercept the ship. The ship then ran wildly aimlessly. Soon, a message came over the radio that there was an iceberg nearby. The passengers asked to reduce speed, but the captain refused. Fortunately, the ice quickly passed by, but the passengers were so frightened that they became abnormal and caused a commotion.

The next morning, the fog had cleared, and the ship resumed its storm-breaking speed. When Jack went off duty and Bover came in to relieve him, a huge, dirty object blocked the door. This was a tall, yellow-bearded man. Jack "could remember at a glance that this man was the leader of the previous night's false alarm.

He glared at Jack angrily, a blue bruise visible under his left eye, a souvenir of the previous night.

"Why did you hit me last night?" he asked angrily. "I want to know your name and ruin your business."

"My name is Jack Reid," Jack said nonchalantly. "As for ruining my business, I'm afraid that's impossible, seeing as I'm here as a special crew member."

"Bah! Don't be so rude to me, you kid! I am a German professor."

"Ah, a schoolteacher," Jack said, smiling happily.

The yellow-bearded man was not happy, his pale eyes flashed fiercely.

"I am a professor—"

"Ah, yes, yes, I know, and it looks like you have a very bad temper."

"Boy, I think you'll get into trouble, I am a superior person."

"Really, it's easy to say that this morning, but it would have been hard to say that last night," Jack said very frankly.

"Be careful, young man, I've already told you, I'm a German professor."

"Ah, enough, don't bring out the sign again."

The man glared at him venomously, realizing that he couldn't gain any advantage here. He turned away roughly, but added a sentence before the door.

"I will immediately report your behavior to the captain, and you will know what the consequences will be for treating passengers so rudely."

"Even so, I can't tell him about your behavior last night."

"Why not?"

"Why? I have to be careful of him, because he has a very bad temper, and he might throw you out of the cabin—from the carpet to the deck of the aisle, enough to suffer."

"You'll get yours," the man cursed angrily, but he knew that he couldn't do anything to Jack, so he walked away full of resentment.

Bover looked at Jack admiringly, but at the same time with a hint of fear.

"I think you've made an enemy," he reminded him.

### Applications for Next Football League Now Open, First Division Still Limited to Twelve Teams, General Meeting on July 10

(Special Report from This Newspaper) The 1938-39 football season ended some time ago, and the Football Association is now starting work on the next season.

Applications for the next league season are now open, closing on the 31st of this month. The registration fee for each First Division team is $30, and for Second and Third Division teams, it is $25. An additional membership fee of $10 is required for each association.

As per regulations, no more than twelve teams may join the First Division League.

The reigning champions, South China, the runners-up, Eastern, and South China Hua, Kwong Wah, and the other four teams will of course join again as before. The composition of the Western teams will also remain largely unchanged. However, the Middlesex Regiment will be transferred at the end of the year, and the East Surrey Regiment, currently stationed in Shanghai, will come south to take their place. Therefore, the East Surrey Regiment will replace the Middlesex Regiment in the league.

It is said that two more British military teams, the Welsh Fusiliers and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, will soon be transferred to Hong Kong for reinforcement. Therefore, the number of army teams in the First Division League may increase compared to last season.

The Football Association is scheduled to hold its annual general meeting on July 10, and new officers will be elected at this meeting. (Stadium Taizui)

### Exciting Baseball Action This Weekend: China vs. Yu Pei, This Game is Crucial for the Championship

(Special Report from This Newspaper) After entering the second round of the public baseball league, the situation has gradually become tense. However, the championship issue is still far from being decided.

Currently, the Yu Pei team has the best record, invincible since the start of the season. Therefore, it not only maintains its undefeated status, but also has the highest hopes of winning the championship.

Yu Pei's strongest rival is undoubtedly the China team. Therefore, whether Yu Pei can ascend to the throne of the league depends on whether it can win both games against China.

The first game this week is between Yu Pei and China. This game is a championship battle. If Yu Pei wins, its championship position will be more stable.

China is the reigning champion and has great strength, comparable to Yu Pei. However, it is a pity that it was unexpectedly defeated by the Mindanao team in the first game of this season, which prevented its current record from keeping pace with Yu Pei.

This week's game between China and Yu Pei is important and must be won. If it is defeated by Yu Pei, I am afraid that this year's championship will no longer belong to China.

Regarding the South China Athletic Association's appeal to the baseball league, it is said that the league will hold a meeting during the day to discuss it. If South China's appeal is successful, then the game lost to the Westerners last week should be canceled and a rematch should be held.

The baseball team of the American warship USS Asheville plans to arrange a friendly match with Yu Pei, but according to the chairman of the league, Liu Guozhang, he has not heard of this matter. The schedule for this week's games is as follows: (Dong Lang)

Saturday, 24th, 2:30 PM

Westerners vs. Hong Kong Club

Sunday, 25th, 10:00 AM

(First Game) China Team vs. Yu Pei Team

(Second Game) South China AA vs. Mindanao

### From Ancient Greece to the Olympic Games

— Ding Law

——A Most Valuable History of Sports——

The Revival of the Olympic World Games

Reasons for the Revival

The developed modern Olympic Games makes us recall the lives of the ancient Greeks. The word "Olympic" is derived from the place name "Olympia." Therefore, "elyrrpiade" is a simplified name for the four-year period between two Olympic festivals, which is completely consistent with the modern term "Olymiac spele" for the quadrennial games. The Greeks, blessed with a mild climate and a system of having slaves engage in labor, made sports the center of their lives. Later, they turned sports into a life of pleasure, gradually becoming corrupt. The citizens lost their steadfast spirit and were eventually conquered by the culturally inferior Romans. The Romans were a practical people, focusing on the benefits gained from war. They lacked the aesthetic cultivation and its drawbacks of the Greeks, to the point where even children enjoyed watching lions devour people. Then, Christ suddenly emerged, vehemently advocating that the spirit is sacred and seeking to destroy the Romans' physical tyranny. Unexpectedly, the savior Christ instead imprisoned people's wisdom, suppressed freedom of thought, and turned the enlightened world into the dark ages of a miserable hell. It was not until the fifteenth century that a general humanism struck the dawn bell, breaking the dark forces of a thousand-year-long night. The leading figures of this era single-mindedly pursued the classics, failing to seek and discuss physical training. However, as people's knowledge gradually opened up and thought became free, not only was there no God in the universe, but some even advocated conquering nature. Indeed, the scientific evolution of several centuries surpassed the achievements of the previous thousands of years. We cannot even name all the benefactors who contributed to scientific inventions for the benefit of mankind. Originally, inventions such as automobiles, trains, and airplanes were intended to conquer nature and benefit mankind, but unexpectedly, humans, by overusing them, have pushed the matter of physical training to the back of their minds, thus degenerating to what extent? Seeing that humanity has developed a kind of aging sickness, people generally want to use medicine to remedy it.

### Countercurrents in the War of Resistance

— Lu Jing

Many young comrades working in the rear areas always believed that the air in the motherland was fresh and invigorating. This was because it was said that the stench that had hindered the War of Resistance—especially the extremely pointless friction—had long been burned away by the flames of the War of Resistance, and that mass work in various places would, needless to say, develop rapidly along with the progress of the War of Resistance. Therefore, many young comrades, full of enthusiasm and hope, abandoned their careers, left their warm and lovely homes, and ran from Hong Kong, from the far-flung regions of Southeast Asia, into the wilderness of the motherland.

However, the reality is not as we imagined. If these enthusiastic comrades are thinking of a rapid cure, I think they will definitely die of frustration and anxiety due to the difficulties of the work.

Millions upon millions of the masses—especially those masses in areas trampled by the enemy's hooves, or those close to enemy rear areas—are waiting for many, many enthusiastic young people to organize them, so that they can take action. This is a very true fact. Their anti-enemy sentiments, having been taught by the enemy's brutal reality, have been raised to the highest degree. They clearly know that without resistance, they will only be captured and killed. To be compliant citizens? That is also a dead end: yesterday they came to demand a certain number of chickens and ducks, today they come to demand a certain number of pigs, and maybe tomorrow they will come to demand a certain number of cows, and the day after tomorrow they will come to demand a certain number of 'flower girls'. What should we do? But when an order from the 'Imperial Army' arrives, you have no choice but to obey. They have witnessed this pain firsthand, or even experienced it personally. In many places, such as Futian on the front line of Bolo, Lianhe, and Dongbo, many moving and heroic stories have been enacted due to their inability to withstand the ever-tightening exploitation and oppression of the 'Imperial Army'. Anyone who has worked in places that have been occupied or are close to the enemy's rear areas will often hear these stories from the mouths of the common people. They are extremely eager to take action and fight to the death with the Japanese warlords. They do not know the difference between parties, nor do they have any preconceptions or biased views. They only know that the only enemy in front of them is Japanese imperialism.

However, the masses' anti-Japanese sentiments are so high, and the government has already opened up the mass movement. The Program for War of Resistance and National Reconstruction has a clear provision for the mass movement, and Chairman Chiang has also emphasized that in the second phase of the War of Resistance, the masses are more important than the army. Why is it that young people, full of enthusiasm, run from far away to the motherland, but instead feel the difficulties of the work and are anxious to die? This extreme contradiction is not without reason. It turns out that many local administrative officials often look at general youth work groups with suspicion. As the saying goes, 'decay breeds worms'. General traitors and spies take the opportunity to enter and sow discord, saying that a certain work group is led by a certain faction, or that a certain service group is organizing the masses for other purposes. Thus, those who harbor prejudices fall into the trap of traitors and spies without realizing it! Therefore, the more active a group is, the less likely it is to gain the understanding of local administrative officials.

In the more than twenty months of the War of Resistance, the fact has already proven that without widely launching a mass movement and bringing millions upon millions of the masses to the anti-Japanese front, the final victory will not necessarily belong to us. Now, many young people, full of enthusiasm, for the sake of rescuing the motherland from danger, abandon their comfortable lives and leave their lovely homes, running from far-flung and prosperous cities to poor and remote villages, or even braving dangers to go to the occupied areas, to the enemy's rear areas. And the hard work is unexpectedly subjected to setbacks, which may be some countercurrents in the War of Resistance.

It is undeniable that many young people, due to temporary emotional impulses, may have some excesses in their work, but we can only actively guide them and help them, and we should not passively prevent them or strike at them. This not only violates the instructions of the supreme leader and the provisions of the Program for War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, but also is enough to fall into the poisonous plot of traitors and spies.

### The Long March

— Shu Lun

At one time, I was forced to leave the area that was about to fall and run to the vast wilderness of the rear. I ran out of the heart of the southern capital and turned to its periphery. Thus, I became good friends with the yellow mud road.

Before, I was very much like a child who did not quite know how to walk. My feet could not trudge the road lying underneath in large amounts; but this time, the external changes stimulated its roots, and it began to use the most enduring strength to devour every small road. Gradually, the two tender feet developed into things that were as thick and strong as horses' hooves, often close together with the road surface, and often dropping it, kicking the dust on the journey far behind the body.

Every day, walking forty or fifty li, the road surface was left underfoot, as if exhaling a sigh of relief.

When it started, every small part of the body was such a great burden, not just the luggage, but even a heart, a drop of sweat, were burdens on the body's progress. We would rather have it all gone sooner or later, or maybe temporarily leave it by the side of the road, if possible.

Slowly, we asked for a bamboo pole to be an assistant to the two feet. We picked up a knife, braving sweat pouring down our heads, and went to the area near the bamboo poles, cut one or two bamboo poles to walk with, relying on it to cross one high mountain after another, and then flow from the low slopes to the flat ground, or, put it in a shallow stream to support the heavy body, using a jumping step to cross to the near bank.

Sometimes, it is extremely lonely, as far as your eyes can see, it is still a flat road, the extension of the road is endless, you can only lean the bamboo pole more heavily on the road.

Sometimes, I would rather leave the only bamboo pole, like leading a blind person, and lead me into a lush dense forest, I can think that the heroes of the green forest, had been animal-like in this wilderness, even pulling my thread of thought a little closer, thinking if our guerrilla team, is like this - I found my joy.

On the Long March, as long as you are willing to turn your head, you will feel happy, to abandon the road you have walked like abandoning some waste. Because in this way, you can maintain the desire to look ahead; but, you still like to look back at the rear road, at that time, you will secretly calculate the endless footprints and laugh!

### The Popularization of Local Literature and Art in Guangdong

— Luo Ying

Recently, many authors in literary and artistic circles have been energetically discussing the topic of "popular literature and art." The slogan "Return literature and art to the masses" has been enthusiastically put forward, with a tendency to sit and talk and then rise and act.

Naturally, popular literature and art aims for nationwide reach as its ultimate goal, but since the dialects throughout the country have not yet been unified, and the masses in various places still have a preference for local literature and art, it seems that it will still take a considerable amount of time to create a kind of nationwide popular literature and art.

For example, Northerners understand and love their "Dagu" and "Peking Opera," and Shanghainese understand and love their "Little Tunes." But when "Cantonese" listen to them, they are dumbfounded and feel bored. Conversely, when Northerners listen to the "Cantonese" things, the same trouble occurs.

Some may say, since the War of Resistance, haven't there been songs for national salvation produced, such as the "March of the Volunteers," "Protecting the Homeland," and the "Great Wall Ballad," many, many songs that are popular throughout the country? Yes, the so-called popularity throughout the country only means that they are popular in domestic metropolises and among the progressive masses. The backward masses in the countryside still have a sense of incompatibility with them.

From this point of view, to practice the topic of popularization of literature and art, local popular literature and art is just as important as national popular literature and art. During the War of Resistance, local popular literature and art should especially not be ignored.

The Guangdong masses have their own things that they love. What else can be advocated to them if we talk about popularization while abandoning the things that they love, need, and can accept? To be specific, besides using old forms such as "folk songs," "mountain songs," "Cantonese odes," "dragon boat songs," "Cantonese opera," "teaching rhymes," and "Cantonese opera" and filling them with new content, is there a more readily available method? If this method has the possibility of being accepted, then authors who intend to popularize Guangdong literature and art have the necessity to learn, explore, and discover from the original popular literature and art of Guangdong. At the same time, they should also discard its shortcomings and absorb its strengths to immediately produce a large amount of new anti-Japanese popular literature and art to meet the current urgent needs.

From the perspective of the current stage of popularization of Guangdong literature and art, new things like dialect "folk songs" and "mountain songs," such as Chaozhou songs and Hakka mountain songs, have already had attempted works published. The large-scale production of them still depends on the literary and artistic authors in various places writing more about the dialects they are familiar with.

Secondly, there are relatively few new "Cantonese odes" and "dragon boat songs" produced. The most difficult thing to overcome is the technical problem of writing. Because they have the limitations of ancient music and rhyme, writing cannot be hasty. If we want to abandon all the pedantic tunes of classical Chinese and use popular colloquial language instead, then there is the difficulty of losing those suitable colloquial languages when taking care of rhyme. Before the technical problem is clarified, writing lightly will even result in works that cannot be sung at all.

Writing "teaching rhymes" is relatively easier. The prerequisite is familiarity with its rhythm and the ability to use rich popular colloquial language. It is best to appropriately use more popular language.

The writing problems of new "Cantonese opera" and new "Cantonese drama" are very complicated. To begin with, one must learn Cantonese music. A large pile of specialized and strange terms such as "Er Huang," "Fan Xian," "Zhong Ban," "Man Ban," "Shou Ban," "Xi Pi," and "Gun Hua"... make people feel dizzy and have no way to start. Even if they are clarified, the question remains whether the decadent tones of the South can be infused with new content of struggle to arouse the masses' fighting spirit. To thoroughly complete the reform of "Cantonese opera" and "Cantonese drama," the fundamental reform of "Cantonese music" is indispensable.

There are currently about two types of new "Cantonese opera."

One is the new "Cantonese opera" that is sung or broadcast by general music groups, which still contains decadent tones and is full of hackneyed tunes. Whether such things meet the standards of popularization, the masses have their own public opinion.

The other type is the attempted work that uses a relatively rigid tune and purely adopts popular colloquial language. Whether it can be developed from the attempt depends on the efforts of more people.

In short, the work of popularizing Guangdong literature and art is the most difficult thing. It is doubted by a part of the new literary and artistic circles, and despised by the general old literary and artistic circles. Those cultural workers who are committed to this movement should of course overcome it with a firm will.

The above is mostly about drama and poetry, and the continued use of the old forms of essays and "biographical-style" long and short novels is also an essential part of popular literature and art and should not be ignored.

Sweeping away the smoke screen of the Japanese invaders

### From Chengdu to Xi'an

— Lin Huanping

VIII. Remembering the Past on the Hanbao Road

Leaving Hanzhong and arriving in Baocheng, at the intersection of the highway to Baoji, there is a large wooden plaque lying horizontally and vertically, on which is written: "This is the great road for anti-Japanese heroes to advance." The people in the car joked: "Are we also anti-Japanese heroes?" Because there were people from agriculture, industry, commerce, and other fields in the car, not just officers and soldiers.

About forty li from Baocheng is Madao, said to be where Xiao He chased Han Xin. Because Han Xin was of humble origin and did not gain popular support. Xiao He introduced him to Liu Bang, but initially he was not trusted by Liu Bang and his subordinates. Han Xin was furious and left alone on horseback. Xiao He was shocked when he heard the news and chased him on horseback from Hanzhong (at that time, Liu Bang occupied Hanzhong and confronted Xiang Yu's generals who occupied Chang'an). He chased him here, caught up with him, pulled him back, helped Liu Bang, and solemnly warned Liu Bang: losing Han Xin means not being able to win the world. Liu Bang immediately appointed Han Xin as General-in-Chief and handed over all military power to him. From then on, Liu Bang had three outstanding talents under him: Han Xin for military affairs, Zhang Liang for politics, and Xiao He for finance.

Not far ahead, beside the towering mountains and precipitous cliffs, there is a trestle road, which is a wooden narrow bridge that can lead to the north of the rain. In ancient times, when highways had not been opened up, the situation was extremely dangerous. Chang'an and Hanzhong have been famous cities since ancient times, and a place that contenders for the world must contend for. But from Hanzhong to Chang'an, or from Chang'an to Hanzhong, there is only this one road to take. It is precisely because of this reason that there is a wooden plaque in Baocheng that reads "This is the great road for anti-Japanese heroes to advance." At that time, the method for military strategists to pass through this dangerous road was to build a trestle road. According to legend, during the Chu-Han War, when Xiang Yu and Liu Bang competed for the world, Liu Bang was the first to enter the Pass and should have been crowned King of Guanzhong, but Xiang Yu violated the agreement and ordered him to be King of Hanzhong. After passing this dangerous pass, Zhang Liang burned these trestle roads to block the advance of Xiang Yu's chariot team. At that time, Liu Bang cried when he saw it. He was imprisoned because he felt that the people of Guanzhong were very grateful for his good governance, and his retreat to Hanzhong was temporary. If even the trestle road is burnt, will he not be able to return to Guanzhong? In fact, this was Liu Bang's foolishness, but Xiang Yu made this mistake even more seriously. He thought that since the trestle road was burnt, Liu Bang would never be able to return to Guanzhong. Later, Han Xin repaired the trestle road, and Xiang Yu laughed when he heard the news. He thought that it would not be possible to repair it without three or two years of work. By that time, my Xiang Yu's world would be as stable as Mount Tai. Xiang Yu's arrogance is evident here. Little did he know that Han Xin had repaired the trestle road in less than a few months, and within half a year, he had already led his troops to the Three Qins. Xiang Yu, the unparalleled hero and Overlord of Chu, after many battles, eventually became unmanageable and was surrounded by heavy siege at Wujiang. In the end, he had no choice but to compose a sentimental poem for his wife, Consort Yu: (To be continued)

### Foreign Nationals, Women and Children Evacuated from Swatow; First Group Arrived in Hong Kong This Morning; Business Staff Remain in Swatow Awaiting Developments; Hong Kong Teochew Community Urgent Consultation on Relief Efforts

Chinese and foreign individuals in Hong Kong are closely monitoring the development of the Swatow war situation. The British naval authorities have made proper arrangements for the safety of British nationals remaining in Swatow. Due to our army's counter-offensive and intense fighting, foreign women and children remaining in Swatow were evacuated to Hong Kong yesterday. One British warship and one American warship remain stationed in Swatow to provide immediate assistance. Three foreign merchant ships returned to Hong Kong from Swatow yesterday. The resumption of traffic between Hong Kong and Swatow is unlikely in the short term. As for Hong Kong, apart from rising food prices and reduced exports, there have been no major impacts.

Foreign Nationals' Evacuation, Arrived in Hong Kong This Morning

Currently, foreign merchant vessels anchored off Swatow include the Taikoo Company's Yingchow, which operates on the Hong Kong-Shanghai route (via Swatow), and Jardine Matheson's Polinmeron. Officials stated that these two merchant ships will be used to transport British women and children from Swatow to Hong Kong. Other nationalities of women and children who wish to leave Swatow will also be facilitated. The reason for the evacuation of British women and children is due to the rapid counter-offensive by our army in Swatow, with war seemingly inevitable. For safety reasons, the British authorities ordered the women and children to be evacuated first, while other business staff remain in Swatow for the time being, awaiting developments and only leaving when necessary. The Yingchow and other vessels departed Swatow at 2:00 PM yesterday and are expected to arrive in Hong Kong this morning. Hong Kong has completed preparations for the reception of the evacuated women and children from Swatow. It is reported that a foreign residential area opposite Swatow City, in [missing Chinese text], has been occupied, and some of the foreign residents there will be arriving in Hong Kong.

Foreign Merchants Returned and Arrived Yesterday

Several foreign merchant ships that returned from Swatow arrived in Hong Kong yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Suiyang, coming from Shanghai to Hong Kong, could not enter Swatow and came directly to Hong Kong, arriving safely at 3:00 PM yesterday. The Chee Soon Company's Chaochow departed Hong Kong for Swatow at 9:00 AM on the 20th and was prevented from entering the port by a [missing Chinese text] ship outside Swatow at 5:00 AM on the 21st. It returned to Hong Kong at 7:00 AM that day, arriving at 6:00 AM yesterday. The same company's Chaoan departed Swatow at 6:00 AM on the 21st and arrived safely in Hong Kong at 3:00 PM yesterday. According to the shipping company, both vessels will temporarily suspend service on the Hong Kong-Swatow route from today. The cargo on the Chaochow, which could not be unloaded in Swatow, was returned to the original ship and has been collected by the cargo owners. In addition, the Douglas Steamship Company's Haicheng, originally scheduled to depart for Swatow on the 21st, temporarily suspended its departure due to a telegram received from Swatow in the afternoon. It was initially planned to take a risk and depart yesterday, but this was cancelled due to the intense fighting in Swatow. The vessel has decided to suspend service temporarily.

Crew Members Describe the Situation in Swatow

According to the comprador of the Chaochow, the vessel departed Hong Kong for Swatow at 9:00 AM on the 20th and arrived outside Swatow at 5:00 AM on the 21st. Several [missing Chinese text] ships were anchored there and signaled the vessel to stop entering the port. [Missing Chinese text] soldiers then drove an electric boat to the vessel, stating that there were military operations in Swatow and instructing it not to enter. The vessel had to anchor outside the port and await news. At 7:30 AM, it departed for Hong Kong without unloading its cargo. There were about thirty or forty [missing Chinese text] cargo motorboats and seven or eight gunboats in the port of Swatow. When the vessel left Swatow, the [missing Chinese text] boats were continuously heading towards the mouth of the Swatow River, it was said. According to key personnel of the Chaoan, the situation in Swatow was extremely tense ten hours before the outbreak of the war. The city's residents had long been evacuated, and the whole city was in a state of desolation. The strong men guarding the doors of shops had also left to assist the military police in guarding and enforcing martial law. Foreign sailors walking on the streets were also advised by the military police to board their vessels as soon as possible. Street fighting was being prepared everywhere in the city. About two miles away from the ship after it departed Swatow, smoke and flames were seen rising into the sky in the city area, presumably a major fire had broken out in the city.

Teochew Community to Discuss Relief Tonight

The Hong Kong Teochew Association for Relief of War Disaster Refugees has scheduled an emergency meeting for 7:00 PM tonight to discuss various issues related to refugee relief. This association is jointly organized by the Hong Kong Chaochow Chamber of Commerce, the Chaochow Native Association, the Chaochow Mutual Aid Society, and other Teochew community organizations and leaders. It had been paying close attention to the tense situation in Swatow some days ago and had made preparations for emergency situations. Now that the war in Swatow has broken out, the relief work should be intensified. According to the person in charge of the association, since the evacuation work in Swatow was well-organized in advance, it is believed that not many refugees will come to Hong Kong. In the future, the relief work will focus on the mainland. The specific methods will be discussed and decided at tomorrow's meeting.

### Hong Kong and Kowloon Court Report; Number of Crimes Increased Sharply Last Year; Opium and Red Pill Cases Increased the Most; Number of Criminal Beggars Doubled, All Due to the War; Fines Received also Increased Significantly

The 1936 annual report of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Magistracy was presented at yesterday's Legislative Council meeting. The report stated that the Hong Kong Magistracy heard a total of 38,612 cases last year, an increase of 221 cases compared to 38,091 cases in 1937. The Kowloon Magistracy heard a total of 34,181 cases last year, an increase of 3,961 cases compared to 30,220 cases in 1937. Opium and red pill crimes were the most prominent, with opium cases in Hong Kong increasing from 500 to 936 and red pill cases increasing from 243 to 419. In Kowloon, opium smuggling cases increased from 351 to 1,259 and red pill cases increased from 84 to 681. The number of beggar cases doubled, all due to the Sino-Japanese War. Judging from the verdicts, the number of licensed hawkers decreased while the number of unlicensed hawkers increased. Hawkers cases accounted for half of all cases handled last year. In addition, the number of children committing crimes of cutting queues and snatching earrings increased. These children often gather in groups and are induced and exploited by adult bandits. Some children aged 12 to 16 have repeatedly committed crimes, which is a truly serious social problem.

The impact of the Sino-Japanese War on crime in Hong Kong is as follows: (A) A large number of poor refugees came to Hong Kong, leading to an increase in the number of beggars and hawkers; (B) Pickpockets increased; (C) Cases of keeping maids increased; (D) Cases of private possession of firearms increased.

Ms. Young recently starred in "The Three Musketeers" with Don Ameche and The Ritz Brothers and then embarked on a trip to the Far East. She will stay here for two days before taking the "Naldera" to Saigon and Australia on Saturday. In addition, another Hollywood comedian, Charlie Murray, and his wife also arrived in Hong Kong from the Philippines a few days ago. Murray praised Loretta Young as "an extremely lovely woman."

### Diocesan Boys' School Student Unrest Prolonged for Three Weeks; Mediation Efforts Ultimately Failed; Students' Compromise Not Accepted by the School; Deadline Has Passed, School Will Implement Notice

The student unrest at Diocesan Boys' School, caused by the school authorities' appointment of Taiwanese student Peng as head prefect, fearing it would hinder the patriotic movement, requesting the principal to appoint someone else, which was not accepted, resulting in a group of students leaving the school and suspending classes, has lasted for three weeks. After multiple attempts at mediation, there has been no effect. More than one hundred students have left the school. Recently, the Student Relief Association, in order to resolve the incident as soon as possible and enable the students to resume classes, decided to mediate again. After several days of efforts, the opinions of both parties gradually converged. The students, in order to consider the future of the majority of the students and resolve the matter as soon as possible, provided the most sincere advice to Bishop Hall, including class leaders Chan Chung-chiu, Chiu Kai-man, Wong Kwong-leung, Ng Ying-chung, Liu Tai-wai, and Kwan Hon-man, who were willing to return to school early and indicated two compromise solutions, requesting the principal to approve: (1) The original class leaders of the school, Chan Chung-chiu and others, had a vacation scheduled to last for one more week. During their vacation, the principal appointed Taiwanese student Peng as acting prefect, which caused student dissatisfaction. Now, the principal is requested to allow Chan Chung-chiu and others to return to school early during the vacation, and Peng's term of office will be terminated early, with [Liu] Tai-wai returning to the position, in order to show a satisfactory solution and enable more than one hundred students who left school to return to school. (2) The principal sent a letter to all parents a few days ago, limiting the students to return to school by the 21st of this month, otherwise they would be expelled. Now that the deadline has passed, the school is requested to cancel the previous decision and allow more than one hundred students to return to school to maintain their studies. The students put forward the above two points of view, and all parties have expressed satisfaction. The school board members were also quite close to this view. School board members Bishop Hall, Sir Lo Yuk-ho, and barrister Peter Shiu were doing their utmost to mediate and consult with the principal, but the principal believed that they could not accept the proposal, and the mediation failed. Yesterday, the Student Relief Association and the students who left the school sent representatives to see the three board members. The three gentlemen were very concerned about the Diocesan Boys' School students, but as they had authorized the principal to handle school affairs, and he objected, the students' solution could not be accepted. Therefore, the students' plan to resume classes today could not be realized temporarily. It is heard that the school authorities had previously advised all students who left school to return to school before the 21st, otherwise they would be expelled. It is believed that the school will decide to implement this notice today. As for whether there is any possibility of a final mediation in the future, it is still unknown.

St. Mary's Church Charity Bazaar

Reverend Li Kau-yan of St. Mary's Church of the Chinese Anglican Church in Causeway Bay has always been enthusiastic about public welfare undertakings. Now, in order to increase funding and promote Zhangwu's work, he has decided to hold a charity bazaar at 11:00 AM on the 24th of this month and respectfully invites Mrs. Pollock to officiate at the opening ceremony. All sectors are welcome to visit.

### Passengers to Australia Must Obtain Visas from Portuguese Doctors; Time-Consuming and Costly, Hoping the Authorities Will Improve

The Hong Kong and Macao authorities regard each other as sources of epidemic transmission and have issued orders that all passengers coming to Hong Kong must bring a certificate of injection against epidemics issued by the Health Bureau with their photo attached, or a certificate issued by any Western doctor registered in Hong Kong, before being allowed to land. However, certificates for passengers traveling from Hong Kong to Macao must be issued by a Portuguese doctor in Hong Kong to be valid. Even if a doctor registered with the Hong Kong Health Bureau obtains a certificate, it must be re-certified by a Portuguese doctor, with a handling fee of two dollars per certificate. There are only five or six Portuguese doctors in Hong Kong, while two to three thousand people travel to Macao every day, so it is extremely inconvenient. Moreover, those who have already obtained a certificate from a Western doctor must pay another two dollars to have it certified by a Portuguese doctor. The reason for this is difficult to understand. For the sake of travelers, the government should try to improve the situation to facilitate travel.

### Macao Government Suddenly Banned Food Exports Yesterday; Due to Daily Decrease in Vegetables Transported to Macao from the Mainland; No Food Was Transported to Hong Kong Yesterday

Since the seesaw battle between our [missing Chinese text] forces in Jiangmen and Xinhui, the Macao authorities, seeing a sharp decrease in firewood supplied to the city, ordered that all firewood be strictly prohibited from being exported. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM yesterday, they suddenly issued an order banning food exports. Therefore, the Hou Kong and other vessels sailing between Hong Kong and Macao did not transport any food to Hong Kong. According to the vessel's staff, the amount of vegetables transported to Macao from the mainland has decreased in recent days, so the Macao authorities' ban on food exports may be a measure to avoid a food panic in the city.

### [Missing Chinese text] Warships Shelling an Italian Vessel Near Cheung Chau; Shells Missed and Landed in British Territorial Waters; Italian Consulate Denies the Vessel Was the Target of [Missing Chinese text] Warships

On the 18th of this month, [missing Chinese text] warships fired artillery near Cheung Chau in Hong Kong waters. Yesterday, according to the Hong Kong Telegraph, although the owner of the Italian ship "Roma," which sails between Hong Kong and Macao, and the Italian Consul in Hong Kong both said that the purpose of the Japanese warships' shelling was not the vessel, reliable sources said that the [missing Chinese text] warships did shell the vessel. When the "Roma" was sailing near Cheung Chau in British territorial waters, it was chased by two [missing Chinese text] warships. This incident occurred on the 18th of this month. The vessel's owner is an American named "Miller." On the morning of that day, it was sailing from Macao to Hong Kong and, about a mile from British territorial waters, was about to enter the port south of Lamma Island when it suddenly saw two [missing Chinese text] warships hoisting signals. The vessel's owner initially thought that the Japanese warships were transmitting messages with the signals, but when the two Japanese warships fired two shots, the vessel realized that the signals were ordering it to stop. At this time, the vessel was about half a mile from British territorial waters. For safety reasons, it opened full throttle and sailed into Hong Kong waters. The [missing Chinese text] warships continued to shell with live ammunition. The vessel sailed into Hong Kong territorial waters, but the [missing Chinese text] warships continued to fire artillery, with the shells landing in British territorial waters, fortunately not hitting the vessel.

### Chamber of Commerce Decides to Promote the July 7th Bond Purchase Movement

The Hong Kong Branch of the National Salvation Public Bond Fundraising Committee launched a campaign to purchase national salvation public bonds to commemorate the second anniversary of the "July 7th" Anti-Japanese War, in order to complete the target of ten million dollars. Yesterday, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce held a regular meeting. During the meeting, Mr. Mok Pui-shang proposed that the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce promote the campaign. He personally declared that he would first purchase $1,000 in salvation bonds as a demonstration. The proposal was then passed, and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce sent a circular to its affiliated member organizations and guilds to find ways to comply.

### All Circles Relief Federation Prepares for July 7th Flower Sale; Flower Colors Strictly Kept Secret

The All Circles Relief Federation is preparing to hold a vegetarian meal and flower sale to commemorate the second anniversary of the "July 7th" Incident. A meeting had previously been convened to discuss the implementation. Yesterday, the second preparatory committee meeting was held. Representatives from the Chung Sing Benevolent Society, the Chong Zheng Association, the YWCA, the Chaozhou Eight District Chamber of Commerce, the Kwong Un Merchants Association, the Cattle and Sheep Merchants Association, the Fresh Fish Traders Association, and other organizations attended. After the chairman of the Lien Sing Society passed the minutes of the first resolution, he reported on the recent progress, such as the production of paper flowers and the distribution of letters. The association has decided to keep the colors of the flowers made this year strictly secret due to the numerous malpractices of last year, and to proceed meticulously. The method of distributing the flowers is that the organizations and schools will first pay the (flower production cost) and then collect the flowers, and they will be responsible for submitting the proceeds from the sale of the flowers to the conference. In addition to the decision made a few days ago that the members of the preparatory committee will take turns to be on duty, it was also decided yesterday to additionally invite Li Siu-kok, Chen Lui-lin, Li Fai-yu, Hon Man-wai, Hon Sui-hin, Ho King-bo, Wong Kai-hong, and Yau Wing-lau, who were involved in last year's event, to assist in the operation, in order to have experienced hands.

### Amateur Social Club Hosts Farewell Dinner for "China Salvation"; Club Launches Donation Drive for "July 7th"

The China Salvation Drama Troupe took the opportunity to promote national defense plays in Hong Kong while on their way to promote overseas, attracting tens of thousands of viewers. It has had a great effect on raising awareness and encouraging anti-Japanese sentiment. The Hong Kong Amateur Social Club hosted a farewell dinner for the troupe at the Eastern Little Garden in Wan Chai on the evening of the 21st. In addition to the "China Salvation" members and "Amateur" members, theatrical veterans also attended, a grand gathering. First, Chairman Yao Jianhou delivered a speech, followed by Wong Ling-man, representing the Amateur Social Club, presenting a banner. Jinshan, the leader of the China Salvation Troupe, received the banner, which was inscribed with "Propaganda for the Nation" to inspire. Then, Lu Fu, Li Jingbo, Jiang Ming, Wong Ling-man, Wu Wei-geng, and others spoke successively, elaborating on "the tasks that Hong Kong workers should undertake after the China Salvation Troupe goes abroad," and invited Liu Danqing, Wang Ying, Fan Zheng, and others from the China Salvation Troupe to speak. After the dinner, Jinshan, the leader of the China Salvation Troupe, gave a speech on unity, strengthening self-education, and serving the anti-Japanese war and nation-building, which was extremely insightful and moving. The atmosphere at the meeting was intense, and the results were good. Finally, Liu Ying led the singing, and everyone dispersed happily.

Furthermore, the club has worked hard in the past on fundraising and collecting慰劳品.

### Guangzhou in August Under Occupation

— Luoxia

Guangzhou, the transportation hub of South China and the sacred site of the revolution, has fallen into enemy hands silently for more than eight months. During these eight months, what has Guangzhou under the iron heel of the enemy become? This is a matter of close concern and yearning for all the compatriots in Guangdong, and even every descendant of the Chinese nation. In the past half week, the reporter interviewed more than ten merchants and villagers who escaped from Guangzhou, which is under enemy control, to Hong Kong, inquiring about the news of Guangzhou. From their conversations, we know very clearly that Guangzhou seems very quiet on the outside, but is in extreme chaos at its core. How our guerrillas are operating and how they are giving the enemy fatal blows further proves that we are absolutely certain of achieving final victory.

Like other places, after the enemy seized Guangzhou, they have been meticulously managing it: establishing puppet organizations, deceiving ignorant villagers to return to the city, and even vigorously collecting gangsters, ruffians, and local bullies in Hong Kong and neighboring commercial ports, transporting them to Guangzhou ship after ship to become their obedient citizens. In addition, they are implementing a kind of appeasement policy, giving small favors to ignorant citizens. However, this cannot conceal the enemy's hideous and ugly state, just like the scorched "Huadi". There, the enemy tried every means to encourage villagers to open shops, offering preferential treatment in the form of tax exemptions. As a result, no one has ever inquired, because everyone has not forgotten how this piece of land was burned. That is: When the enemy occupied Guangzhou, the owners of several rice warehouses there were afraid that the rice would fall into the enemy's hands, so they asked the villagers to freely transport large quantities of it. Later, when the enemy found out, they killed the villagers who were carrying the rice. Everyone was afraid that the rice would really be snatched by the enemy, so they set a fire at night and burned the entire "Huadi" to the ground. From this point, it can be clearly seen the degree of hatred of the people against the enemy.

The enemy does not seem to reduce their longing for the dream of prospering Guangzhou because of this. They fear using more than 30,000 Imperial Army troops and use all kinds of terror methods to iron-press the anti-Japanese sentiment of the citizens and "eliminate" those guerrillas that the enemy considers terrifying. Right in the middle of the enemy's "tight defense", more than 20 guerrillas came to the enemy's only financial institution, the Yokohama Specie Bank (inside the Aiqun Hotel), unceremoniously tied up the majestic "Imperial Army" outside the door, and then moved more than 100,000 yuan of cash from the bank to a small motorboat and left calmly. Such a ridiculous thing happened in a heavily guarded place, which is simply a great insult to the "Imperial Army"! No! This is not a big insult! There are more big insults. In a latrine in Dashaji in Xiguan, one "Imperial Army" soldier went in to defecate with great "majesty", but when he came out, his gun was gone, and his clothes were stripped off. He ran out naked, and his companions were dumbfounded when they saw him.

If three or five enemy soldiers are strolling in a quiet place, then their lives will inevitably be a little dangerous. To put it bluntly, our guerrillas did not miss this good opportunity. Two bombs in Sipaifang once resulted in the deaths of more than 20 enemy soldiers. In addition, in Baohua Road and Taikang Road, our guerrillas also left many achievements. This kind of terrible and terrifying situation occurs every two or three days, which makes the enemy feel a little chilled!

Also, in those prosperous teahouses, our guerrillas are often found promoting [their cause]. No matter how many shameless traitors are sitting there, the guerrillas do not pay attention. They only send two people to keep watch outside the door, and then speak freely inside, explaining our war of resistance in great detail to the "tea guests", hoping that they will "rest assured" and wait for our army's counterattack to be our internal support. This kind of intentional action has been discovered one after another in "Lumingju" on Taiping Road, "Qimeizhai" on Changdi, and "Fuxing" on Datong Road.

This series of vivid events is enough to give the enemy a headache. In fact, up to now, the enemy has not only failed to crack the organization of our guerrillas' activities, but has not even caught a single guerrilla. The enemy has announced that the methods of preventing guerrilla activities have been exhausted. They have also said very miserably to the merchants and civilians: "If we counterattack, their lives will only have a three-point hope." This is a desolate and tragic saying!

What did the enemy gain from occupying Guangzhou? Now, the enemy seems to know that they cannot gain a firm foothold in Guangzhou. They are already doing their best to manage their escape routes. We firmly believe that one day, when our army counterattacks, the enemy will definitely run out of the Pearl River like a flock of ducks. "The enemy's feet are deep in the mud!" Now, each of us should firmly believe in this truth.

### Night University

— Meng

Wealthy families have the economic strength to send their children to university, or even study abroad, to be gilded and return. But the children are not making progress, nominally studying medicine, but in reality wandering around, and cannot even get a middle school diploma. Poor families have children who are very smart and ambitious, and want to graduate from university, but the family's economic strength is not enough. They can only drop out of school halfway. At most, after graduating from high school, they have to leave school and find a job. This seems to have become a formula, which makes people feel the unfairness of creation. Why should mankind have poverty and wealth?

A young person, due to the environment, cannot receive the ideal education. Once they leave school life and enter society, sometimes they often feel difficulties in handling events due to insufficient knowledge, and sometimes due to qualification issues, they do the same thing, but the positions are very different, and the rewards they get are less than others. When encountering such things, the pain and resentment felt in the heart are unknown to those who have not experienced it.

All ambitious young people, being in such an environment, under determination, can only make up their minds to use their spare time to study and improve their education. However, most of the general tutoring schools are of secondary level. Vocational young people who already have secondary level want to use their spare time, serve during the day, and study at night, and often feel that the tutoring schools do not have university-level subjects. Even if they are ambitious, they have no place to study.

Indeed, all universities originally have classes during the day. However, perhaps those who run education also see the distress of vocational young people who feel insufficient in their academic ability and have nowhere to study. In Shanghai, there are also several universities that have classes at night, which are the night universities mentioned in this article. In this way, you can serve in society and at the same time seek progress, you can use your spare time, work during the day, and study at night.

Speaking of night universities, the oldest and most historical in Shanghai is probably Soochow? However, Soochow only has law courses, and the regulations are very strict. Only those who have graduated from university preparatory courses can take the exam. After graduation, the qualifications are exactly the same as those of the university classes during the day. Due to qualification issues, perhaps many vocational young people who have graduated from secondary schools sigh and cannot take the exam. However, on the other hand, Soochow's night university has always been a good opportunity for many vocational young people who have entered university and dropped out halfway and entered society. Over the years, Soochow has indeed created many great lawyers.

Following Soochow, Zhizhi Law School, Shanghai Law School, and Law and Politics College also had classes at night, and of course, they also created many legal talents. In addition to law courses, the National School of Commerce also had classes at night for a while, but later, due to the Ministry of Education's re-formulation of university regulations, those who had classes in the evening were severely restricted, so the School of Commerce cancelled the evening courses. After the "January 28 Incident", the late President Liu Zhan'en of Shanghai University, in order to enable general good young people to have a place to study in their spare time and receive university education, founded the Shanghai University City Urban District Business School on Yuamingyuan Road, mainly with business courses, and with special news courses and special courses, starting classes every day from 5 pm, and for a while, 500 to 600 ambitious young people used their spare time to enter the Shanghai University Night University. It is a pity that the night school was not officially registered due to the regulations of the Ministry of Education, which inevitably made the students feel dissatisfied.

The author also studied at the night university for two years, and went to class every night. I saw many vocational young people who were serving in agencies or foreign companies. They did not leave the office until 5 pm, and then they rushed to school with their books, each one in a hurry, walking into the school gate one after another, afraid of being late. If there were several nights when they had three or four classes in a row, they would study on an empty stomach and did not have to go back to eat dinner until nine o'clock. In the classroom, everyone quietly buried their heads and listened to the professor's explanation. This kind of spirit is not found in the students in the daytime schools.

After the "August 13 Incident", several universities in Nanshi and Zhabei were unable to continue classes. Some moved to the inland, and some moved into the concession. However, because there were too many people in the concession, there were problems with the school buildings. Several universities could not rent school buildings, so they borrowed the school buildings of secondary schools for classes. However, those secondary schools also had to have classes themselves, so they could only lend out the school buildings after class, which forced the universities that temporarily borrowed the school buildings to have classes after 4 pm. Most of the courses were scheduled at night, so the universities that had classes during the day also temporarily seemed to become night universities.

### History of the Shanghai Evening News

— Huoma

The interest of Shanghai people in reading evening newspapers does not seem to be as high as that of Beijing people. Before the War of Resistance, the World Evening News and other newspapers in Beijing were very popular. Mr. Cheng Shewo established his career by running the World Evening News, and later expanded it into a daily newspaper. However, the history of the Shanghai evening newspaper is not shallow, but many early evening newspapers were short-lived and failed, and everyone did not pay attention to them.

The earliest evening newspaper in Shanghai can be said to be the "Evening News" published by the North China Herald (the Chinese version published by the North China Daily News, which has now been discontinued). The time was in the early years of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. When the evening newspaper was sold every day, the residents of Nanshi had already closed their doors and rested, and the theaters and shops in Beishi were just coming on the market. No one had time to read the newspaper. Occasionally, some were sold in tea houses and restaurants, but the number was really limited, and finally, they stopped publishing due to losses.

However, when something happened, Shanghai people were eager to read the latest news. The morning newspaper was not enough, so they wanted the evening newspaper. The evening newspaper was not enough, so they wanted the noon newspaper. That was the golden age of the evening newspaper. In the 24th year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, the "Wuxu Coup" occurred in the Forbidden City. The Empress Dowager Cixi imprisoned Emperor Guangxu, and the Six Gentlemen were killed. Kang Youwei fled to Wusongkou on a foreign warship, causing a sensation in the city. At that time, the "Shanghai Evening News" took the opportunity to rise.

During the Xinhai Revolution, the war news in Ezhong changed several times in one night. Readers were waiting at the gate of the newspaper office for news. This newspaper even published five or six extra editions in one day, fearing that it was not enough, so it wrote a warning in large letters and posted it outside the door. "Those who gathered to watch were shoulder to shoulder, blocking the street." (See the Sea Chat in this newspaper on October 15th of the Xinhai year.) Also, the picture weekly of this newspaper on the Double Tenth Festival in the 19th year reprinted a photo, which was taken of the scene of the Xinhai Revolution when the door of this newspaper was crowded with people scrambling to read the express news.) At that time, other evening newspapers were also very active.

After that, during the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War in the 13th year of the Republic of China, the Feng-Zhejiang War in the Southeast in the 14th year, and when the National Revolutionary Army fiercely attacked Nanchang in October of the 15th year, the evening newspapers in Shanghai were all in a state of frenzy for a while. The Southeast Evening News, published in the 13th year, was originally the organ newspaper of Zhejiang-Lu. It was different from ordinary speculative evening newspapers. This may be the beginning of evening newspapers with a political background. At that time, Zhejiang-Lu also ran a Southeast News Agency to expand its influence. Sun Chuanfang attacked Zhejiang from Fujian, and Lu Yongxiang was defeated and fled. The evening newspaper and the news agency also quietly ended.

During the era when Sun Chuanfang dominated five provinces, the Central Government set up an evening newspaper in Shanghai, called the "Zhongnan Evening News", as a propaganda mouthpiece against the warlords. It was run with great spirit. Sun Chuanfang could not bear the painful scolding and cold discussions, so he borrowed the crime of "redification" and asked the concession authorities to seal the newspaper and imprison the organizer in the French Concession prison. A month later, the National Revolutionary Army recovered Songjiang and Shanghai and welcomed the organizer of the Zhongnan Evening News out of prison.

The history of Western evening newspapers in Shanghai is even earlier. The ancestor of Western agricultural publications was the North China Daily News, which was founded on July 1, 1864. Three years later, the first English evening newspaper in Shanghai was published, called the "Evening Express". The following year, the "Shanghai Evening Courier" was founded. In 1877, it merged with the "Jinyuan Daily". In 1879, it merged with the Shanghai Mercury. In 1930, it merged with the English Greater Shanghai Evening Post. Therefore, the body of the Shanghai Evening Courier, which was founded in 1868, has disappeared (the Shanghai branch library of the Asian Literary Association has a special collection of old newspapers of the newspaper, which is very precious), but the spirit still continues. Tracing the history of the English Greater Shanghai Evening Post, it has been 70 years.

(Note: Last week, this magazine published an article that was not much different from this article about evening newspapers. Because this article is more detailed and has many corrections, it is published without fear of repetition).

### Working Women in Shanghai

— Xinliang

Do you know that Shanghai is an unbalanced city? (In fact, it's not just the sea, many cities are), from any group of men, women, or children, we can easily find a contrast.

For example, take women.

A small portion of women have money, use silver spoons to eat, play mahjong, watch movies, dance, eat big meals, go to companies, or fall in love become their daily work,

However, contrary to them, there is another group of humble women who are fighting for their lives every day—in order to live.

This contrast declares that Shanghai is an unbalanced city.

The tens of thousands of working women in Shanghai not only have to work for their own food and clothing, but also, most of them have to maintain their entire families. Some mend socks for workers, some sell flowers, some are dancers and female office workers in companies, and some set up small stalls along the street, sell paper ingots, and work as servants in people's homes.

They all work very hard, and their efficiency is not lower than that of ordinary men, and sometimes they can even earn more money than men.

Since the outbreak of the war, countless men have lost their jobs. Due to the pressure of life, many women have had to go to various professional levels to work hard to find work in order to have enough to eat.

Now, let's see how they live,

In Shanghai, not all flower sellers are girls. Old women in their fifties also carry flower baskets and ask to sell them in the alleys. Unlike foreign countries, flower sellers do not have to dress well to attract customers. Of course, a pleasing young girl can always do more business.

Selling flowers in Shanghai is different from selling flowers in Suzhou. In Suzhou, some flower-selling girls pretend to sell flowers and do their real business. Pre-war Suzhou was originally a famous production site for greasy flower-selling girls!

The flower-selling girls in Shanghai are not from Suzhou. Nor are they pretty. Although a few also smiled and sold in low-end bars, most of them were standing on street corners, with messy hair, dirty and unable to attract people's pleasure.

We can most easily find them near the crowded playgrounds. In fact, they are everywhere—whether at bus and tram stations or at the doors of companies and theaters.

They sell, they even stuff flowers in front of our noses. Each gardenia flower only sells for a few copper coins, at most one or two corners, even those who work as servants in people's homes often put gardenia flowers by their hair,

These flower sellers probably earn from five cents to one yuan a day. Early in the morning, they first wholesale flowers from flower growers, and then take them to the streets to sell until the night is quiet. A Chinese thought. The reason why there are so few attractive flower sellers is because women with beautiful faces have turned to other profitable occupations.

Mending socks and sewing skirt ladies formed another group of working women on the street. Most of them are foot-bound and elderly Jiangbei people, and they are near the docks or factories. Workers can ask them to mend clothes or broken socks for a few copper coins. Their capital is just a small basket—including needles and threads, and a small short stool. With these, they can indeed earn more money for their families.

After the outbreak of the war, many sock menders also poured into the residential areas. We can often see them quietly sitting on small short stools on the edges of the steps, busily working old with needles and threads.

Next, it's the turn of the women who sell paper ingots. They carry paper ingots on their shoulders and go to each door to sell. On the first and middle of each month, many people buy paper ingots from them to burn.

Before the war, many thrifty Pudong women glued these paper ingots in their own homes and came to Shanghai twice or three times a week to sell them. Of course, the war has reduced their business a lot, but every festival, they can always feel happy about the large transactions.

There is also a large group of female office workers in the company. You will be sure to see many beautiful and smart girls at the company counter. They have to stand for eight hours in a row every day, but the monthly salary is less than fifteen yuan. However, they must wear beautiful clothes, use imported rouge to rouge their cheeks, and always wear a smile, even if the customer just looks and walks away. This is the life of an average female office worker.

Recently, there are also some charming waitresses in Chinese restaurants or tea rooms who wear uniforms. Countless girls are seeking work in this place. Female operators can earn twenty yuan a month.

Now, on the contrary, in the dance halls, there is another group of women wearing noble and luxurious silk clothes, with blood-red lips, who are immersed in money and wine all day and night, dancing wildly: they do not pay the slightest attention to those unfortunate sisters who are struggling in the cold streets. The money they spend in one night can maintain the lives of a group of working women for several months!

Shanghai is really an unbalanced city!

### Cigarette Paper Shops in Shanghai

I don't know from when! Some say that after the Opium War, cigarette papers surged into Shanghai like a raging tide. To adapt to this environment, a type of shop "called a cigarette paper shop" also began to flourish in Shanghai at this time, springing up in this metropolis like bamboo shoots after a rain. Even now, cigarette paper shops can truly be said to be "one every three steps" and "one every five steps," becoming the most numerous and widespread shops in all of Shanghai.

The name "cigarette paper shop" is deeply imprinted in our minds. In our daily lives, we can hardly separate from it for a moment. In addition to selling cigarette papers, some also sell incense, candles, tin foil, oil, soy sauce, kerosene, matches, soap, and toilet paper, and other daily necessities. Therefore, if Shanghai were to be without these "department store" shops, our lives would become unbearably uncomfortable!

Although we commonly refer to them as cigarette paper shops, based on their different business scopes and capital, we cannot treat them as a single entity.

Some are cigarette paper shops in the truest sense, specializing in the sale of cigarette papers. Besides making some retail sales in the storefront every day, they specialize in large-scale wholesale business. Some of them purchase various brands of cigars and cigarettes from major cigarette companies and then wholesale them in bundles or boxes to other smaller cigarette paper shops. In such a turnover, they earn a lot of money. Others have contracts with cigarette factories, buying up all the cigarettes produced by the entire factory. In this way, they can control the market price of such cigarettes, and the money they earn is naturally much more than the former. There are also those who are the exclusive agents for certain brands of foreign cigars or cigarettes. In addition to earning rich profits from buying and selling, like the first type, the foreign manufacturers of those cigars or cigarettes also give them a large commission every year, based on the amount they sell.

The above is a general overview of several large cigarette paper shops in Shanghai. Next, we can talk about the smaller cigarette paper shops. Of course, the business they do every day cannot be compared with those large cigarette paper shops, but in terms of the scope of business, they are much broader than those who specialize in wholesale business. Their business ranges from cigarettes to various groceries, including all daily necessities. Some even sell dried Mandarin fish, Bagua Dan, Wan Jin You (Tiger Balm), and other household medicines, as well as candy, biscuits, stationery, toys, needles, thread, stamps... In short, as long as you can name it, you can find it in a cigarette paper shop. Whenever it comes to the first day of the lunar month, the fifteenth, Qingming Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and the end of the year, the cigarette paper shops do a lot of business. Especially during the end of the year, business increases several times compared to normal, so that the original manpower in the shop is too busy to cope, and they need to find extra people to help out. Superstitious old women make cigarette paper shops earn a lot of money. Incense, candles, paper ingots, incense burners, paper sedan chairs to send the "Kitchen God Bodhisattva" to heaven, Jia Ma (paper effigies of horses and soldiers), and so on, consume an unknown amount every year, and indirectly, the cigarette paper shops get countless benefits.

All cigarette paper shops, regardless of their size, also engage in "exchange." The so-called "exchange" is the common practice of exchanging copper coins for legal currency or small change. On the other hand, many street vendors and vegetable vendors in small vegetable markets exchange the scattered copper coins they earn from selling goods in a day for legal currency at cigarette paper shops. This kind of "exchange" also makes cigarette paper shops earn a lot of money, because when exchanging copper coins for them, it is customary to raise the exchange rate by two or three copper coins according to the market price, as if it were the cigarette paper shop's handling fee. However, when they exchange copper coins for customers, they often give three or four copper coins less than the market price. We know that one yuan of legal currency is clearly one hundred copper coins, but in cigarette paper shops, we can only exchange ninety-nine cents. The money they earn in such buying and selling is truly astounding.

The location of a cigarette paper shop has a great influence on its business. Therefore, they are mostly located near small vegetable markets, tram and bus stops, and the exits of alleys, and rarely in quiet, dark corners. As long as it is in a bustling central area, even a narrow room or a small stall can do a lot of business. In Shanghai, there are countless such cigarette paper shops. If you are interested in counting them, you might find it interesting!

Regarding their organization and capital, because of their different scales, the organization of large cigarette paper shops is very complex, with shareholders, managers, and accountants, and the capital must be more than ten thousand yuan to operate. Other smaller ones only need two or three shop assistants and a few apprentices, and their capital is much smaller than the larger ones, probably between several thousand yuan. The smallest type, the "husband and wife shop," only needs the husband and wife to work together, plus an apprentice to do odd jobs, which is enough to handle the customers for a day.

For the sake of easier operation and less capital, Shanghai people with five hundred or one thousand legal currency all like to open a small cigarette paper and grocery shop. Therefore, in Shanghai today, such shops are everywhere.

### Recommendation Shops

— Fang Zhou

People in Shanghai can be roughly divided into two categories: those who are employed by others and those who employ others; however, among those who are employed by others or employ others, there are also differences in class and situation. Especially those who are employed by others also employ others, and those who employ others are also employed by others, such interlocking relationships, I think, cannot be understood by a simple explanation.

The relationship between employment and being employed in Shanghai is constantly going on, so there are special businesses such as employment agencies and recommendation shops in Shanghai. However, employment agencies that introduce legitimate occupations have not yet been found; although there have been a few speculative employment agencies in the past, they were only a kind of scam. As for those that introduce daughters-in-law, older sisters, and nannies, they are the so-called recommendation shops. Recommendation shops can be roughly divided into three groups: Suzhou, Shaoxing, and Yangzhou. Most of the areas they open in are in the north of the creek, such as North Zhejiang Road, Kenenghai Road, Kaifeng Road, Haining Road, and Avenue Edward VII. There are also a few south of the Old Rubbish Bridge. In the past, as long as we took a circle on those roads, we could see many recommendation shops with signs such as "Old Wang of Gusu Recommends," "Old Zhang of Shaoxing Recommends," and "Old Someone of Weiyang Recommends." And in those recommendation shops, there are always many old women or women sitting there, waiting to be hired by others.

As for the organization of recommendation shops, it is very simple. They do not need a lot of capital, nor do they need magnificent decorations. They only need to rent a storefront along the street, prepare a little furniture for use, and hang up a sign of a recommendation shop, and they are successful. However, some also prepare a loft so that those who have just arrived in Shanghai from the countryside and have no relatives to stay with can borrow a place to stay temporarily. However, they also have to charge a few room fees for borrowing a place to stay overnight. During the day, they put a few benches on the front so that those waiting to be hired can sit there and wait for employers.

But the owner of a recommendation shop must also have connections. Without connections, it will not work. For example, a certain group is familiar with the paths of a certain group. Several consulates or wealthy families almost always have their footprints; and each family has its own regular customers. The maids, older sisters, and nannies who enter and leave a certain consulate or a certain wealthy family must be recommended by a certain recommendation shop. In addition, there are naturally those who go to the recommendation shop to call for someone themselves.

After the recommendation shop sends the person to be hired, the employer has to pay the person sent a certain amount of travel expenses. However, the first three days are the trial period. If they are not satisfied within the trial period, they can ask the recommendation shop to send another person. However, some consulates notify the recommendation shop in advance of what kind of person they want to hire, and then let the recommendation shop find them on their behalf.

I have already said in the previous article that there were originally three groups of recommendation shops in Shanghai. Among these three groups, each has its own business paths. The employers of the Gusu group mostly always use the recommendation shops of the Gusu group to find servants. At the same time, those waiting to be hired in Suzhou, needless to say, must go to the recommendation shops of the Gusu group. So, invisibly, they are also clearly separated, but there are also exceptions, because sometimes employers from Jiangsu prefer to hire a Shaoxing maid, or a local employer wants to hire a Suzhou nanny, etc. But this situation is ultimately in the minority, perhaps because hiring people from the same hometown can reduce some of the misunderstandings in language and habits.

A woman, because she cannot live in her hometown or at home, has no choice but to come to Shanghai to find something to do. However, because she has no knowledge or specialized skills, the only way out is to serve others; if she has acquaintances in Shanghai, she can naturally ask them to find a way to introduce her. If she has no acquaintances, she has to go to a recommendation shop, but recommendation shops also have the rule of not recommending without a guarantor, so to introduce someone, you must first have a guarantor.

After the recommendation shop properly introduces a servant and agrees on the salary, they have a rule that the person being recommended must pay two-tenths or three-tenths of the monthly salary as a reward commission to the recommendation shop, for a period of three months or six months.

Four or five years ago, recommendation shops were once very popular, but now, job seekers are often introduced by relatives and friends, and employers directly hire them. Therefore, the fate of recommendation shops has also declined and is unbearable to look back on.

### Taxi Fares Increase: $1.40 per 20 Minutes

The four major taxi companies in Shanghai, Yunfei, Xiang Sheng, Tailai, and Yinse, due to the rapid increase in gasoline and other materials in Shanghai, which has increased costs, have increased taxi fares again from June 12 to $1.40 per 10 minutes and $4.20 per hour. Before the war, taxis in Shanghai were $1 per 20 minutes, and later increased to $1.20. This price increase is the second time.

### Snippets × Rumors of Threats Against the British Ambassador to China: The Ambassador Takes Necessary Precautions

A Haitong News Agency dispatch reported that, according to the "China Press," British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr has recently received many warning letters threatening his life. As a result, he is now constantly surrounded by multiple bodyguards. The ambassador and embassy staff are wearing bulletproof vests to prepare for unforeseen circumstances.

The North-China Daily News reported that, in view of the threats to the life of British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the Shanghai Municipal Police took special precautions at the British Embassy and the ambassador's residence at 50 Rue Duconsul on the afternoon of the 12th. The embassy offices are located in the Jardine Matheson Building. Uniformed Chinese and Western police officers were stationed at the entrance and in the lobby of the building. The entire sixth floor is occupied by the embassy offices. A Chinese constable was stationed in front of each of the two elevators on that floor, and five Western detectives were sitting in the waiting room, watching the entrance to the offices without shifting their gaze. When reporters asked a senior embassy official, he declined to disclose the nature of the threats, but it was heard that the threats were not from official circles. The British ambassador had received threatening letters. According to another source, the police had obtained intelligence about an attempted conspiracy, so they took precautions. At nearly 5:45 p.m. that day, when Sir Archibald Clark Kerr left the embassy, he walked to the car and sat on the right side. Two detectives wearing chainmail vests and the ambassador's secretary were sitting in the back of the car. Uniformed police officers rode motorcycles in front of the ambassador's car, and a police car with three detectives wearing chainmail vests and armed with pistols followed behind to protect the ambassador. Similar precautions were taken at the ambassador's residence, with Western detectives stationed inside and outside. It was also heard that additional permanent guards had been assigned, and a uniformed police officer and a Western detective were stationed behind the residence outside the iron gate. Inside the gate, a guard armed with a rifle and bayonet was stationed.

According to the Continental Daily News, British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr has received intense threats, so extra military police have been stationed at the ambassador's residence at 50 Rue Duconsul and the embassy offices at 27 The Bund to provide protection. The exact nature of the threats has not been disclosed, but an embassy official told reporters that someone had threatened the British ambassador. The threats received were not in the form of letters, but through external declarations. In addition to stepping up security, the police are now conducting a thorough investigation.

### Re-Export of Goods Purchased with Foreign Exchange: Re-Export Taxes Exempted: The Ministry of Finance Formulates Three Measures for Exemption to Facilitate the Export of Domestic Products

In order to facilitate the export of goods purchased with foreign exchange, the Ministry of Finance of the National Government has issued three measures for exempting re-export taxes, ordering them to be followed by all customs offices. At the same time, the Zhejiang Customs Office announced that cotton parcels transported from the occupied areas to the interior must be notified to the local tax authorities to levy consolidated taxes. The details are recorded below:

Measures for Tax Exemption on Exported Goods

The Ministry of Finance ordered all customs offices to state that the exemption from export taxes for goods purchased with foreign exchange and exported overseas has been implemented since January 1 of this year. In order to facilitate the re-export of goods purchased with foreign exchange, the Ministry has specially formulated three measures for the passage of re-export taxes, as follows: (1) Merchants pay the full amount of deposit and release, limited to a one-year period, and the customs verifies the certificate of purchase of foreign exchange or the Category A transportation permit and returns the deposit. If the deadline is exceeded, the deposit will be entered into the customs account. (2) Merchants obtain a guarantee from any bank of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, or the Farmers Bank, or other banks approved by the customs, and deposit it with the customs. If the one-year deadline is exceeded, the taxes will be cleared. (3) When starting to purchase goods, merchants consult with the Trade Commission to determine the transportation and storage measures. The commission issues a certificate to the customs, listing the name, quantity, estimated value, and the name and address of the owner of the goods, guaranteeing that they will be exported overseas within one year. If the deadline is exceeded and the goods have not been exported, the owner of the goods shall pay the re-export tax in accordance with the regulations, or the Trade Commission shall be responsible for paying it. Merchants are allowed to choose the above measures freely, and they will be implemented from the date of the telegram. In addition to telegramming the Director-General of Customs and the Trade Commission separately, a special telegram is sent to comply with the regulations and to notify everyone.

Additional Consolidated Taxes on Cotton Parcels

The Zhejiang Customs Superintendent and Tax Officer announced that, in accordance with the telegram order of the Ministry of Finance, in the future, all cotton yarn, directly woven finished products, and processed products transported from the occupied areas to the interior in parcels must be notified by the customs at the place of arrival to the local consolidated tax authorities to pay the consolidated tax in order to prevent leakage and maintain tax revenue. In accordance with this, the customs shall comply with the regulations. In the future, for the above-mentioned parcels, even if the customs re-export tax has been paid, a receipt for the consolidated tax must be presented before they can be released. This notice is hereby issued for general information.

Refund of Transfer Tax on Goods Purchased with Foreign Exchange

All merchants who have paid the transfer tax on the 13 categories of goods that should be purchased with foreign exchange within the past year, and which are exported after New Year's Day of this year, or are currently being prepared for export, are limited to three months to verify and register the original transfer tax payment. The original tax-collecting customs office, after receiving notification that the goods have been shipped overseas, shall verify the registered transfer tax bill and foreign exchange settlement documents, or the Category A transportation permit, and verify and refund the original transfer tax paid, but only for those who declare for export the original goods in the original package or in accordance with the regulations for repackaging within one year after the re-export to the second port of destination. This is to be followed.

Additional Consolidated Taxes on Cotton Parcels

In the future, all cotton yarn, directly woven finished products, and processed products transported from the occupied areas to the interior in parcels must be notified by the customs at the place of arrival to the local consolidated tax authorities to pay the consolidated tax in order to prevent leakage and maintain tax revenue.

### Reiterate the Previous Order Prohibiting the Use of Silver Coins: Consolidate the Credit of the Legal Currency: Exchange for Legal Currency at the Four Banks for Circulation: Establish More Collection and Exchange Agencies to Actively Collect and Exchange

The Ministry of Finance's Yu Qian Zi No. 3798 communicated to the governments of all provinces, stating that the Ministry's concrete plan for the implementation of the second phase of the wartime administrative plan, as well as the phased progress table, have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and transferred to the Supreme National Defense Council for review. Item E of this plan is financial matters: (1) Consolidate the credit of the legal currency; (2) Collect gold and silver. It is stated that remote areas in our country, such as Mongolia, Qinghai, and Ningxia, still use silver coins. They should be strictly prohibited from circulation and actively collected and exchanged. The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the military and political leaders of the respective regions to announce the prohibition of the circulation of hard currency again and to instruct the gold and silver collection and exchange offices of the four banks to establish more agencies to actively collect and exchange them, so as to complete the prohibition of the circulation of hard currency in the shortest possible time and increase the amount of silver collected. The phased progress table states that the prohibition of the circulation of hard currency will be continuously handled from the first phase to the eighth phase. The Ministry has repeatedly requested the governments of all provinces to inform their subordinates and announce it to the public. It should be reiterated that the previous order should be strictly enforced. In addition to separately informing and sending a letter to the General Office of the Joint Office of the Four Banks, instructing the gold and silver collection and exchange offices to plan to increase the number of collection and exchange agencies, it is appropriate to send a letter to your esteemed provincial government for review and instruct your subordinates to uniformly announce and strictly prohibit the circulation of silver coins. If hard currency users are found, they should be promptly guided to send it to the nearby branches of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank, or their entrusted exchange agencies, to exchange it for legal currency for circulation, and to report the handling situation to the Ministry for verification.
