### The Future of Our Country's Resistance

— Liu Zhenhuan

Since the fall of Guangzhou and the planned abandonment of Wuhan, the people of our country have been speculating a lot about the future of the resistance. People with common sense all understand that the deeper the × people go, the more advantageous it is for us; the wider the battlefront expands, the more dispersed the × people's forces become, and the more difficult it becomes for them. Not only do we not harbor pessimism, but we also believe that this is a future in which resistance is bound to win. However, up to now, there are still a few who suffer from "fear of Japan" and are taking advantage of our military setbacks to continue spreading rumors of defeatism, attempting to shake our central government's determination to resist and turn our sacred national liberation struggle into compromise and surrender, so that they can establish a puppet regime under the protection of Japanese imperialist force. This is worthy of our attention! I am writing this paper to give a clear and correct answer to this question from all aspects.

Naturally, in its continued progress, our resistance still contains many difficult and arduous factors, especially from the surface, we still seem to be trapped in a very large crisis. However, the problem is by no means so simple: the victory or defeat of the Sino-Japanese War cannot be seen from the surface, but must be determined by comparing the social and economic structures of the two nations; moreover, it cannot be determined in isolation by comparing China and Japan alone, but must be linked to the trends of international politics and economics in order to reach a final determination. That is to say, we cannot estimate this war from form, but must estimate it from substance. We cannot isolate the Sino-Japanese War from world relations and examine it, but must examine it as a part of the whole of world relations, and then we can obtain a correct understanding.

First, judging from the nature of this resistance, our resistance is neither a feudal civil war launched for the benefit of a few feudal warlords, nor an imperialist war launched for the benefit of a few capitalists, but a national liberation revolutionary war launched by every person of the entire Chinese nation for their own survival, the survival of the country, and the survival of the race. Japan, on the contrary, for the benefit of a few capitalists and landlords, drives a large number of the laboring masses, directly and indirectly, onto the line of death in an aggressive war. The longer the aggressive war lasts, the more it will be impossible to sustain due to the awakening of the broad laboring masses, until it reaches the inevitable failure of the war. Conversely, our anti-aggression national revolutionary war will become more and more awakened by the people, the more heroic to resist, and the more able to guarantee the final victory. Regarding this point, the example of Turkey in the past has definitely proven it. China has gradually overcome its previous weaknesses, and the growth of this power is not a problem. Facts have proven that the resistance of the past ten months has already shown an unprecedented awakening of our nation, created an unprecedented great unity of our nation, formed the unity of our national regime and national army, improved our nation's confidence in final victory, strengthened the spirit of our soldiers to sacrifice to the end, and also considerably hit ×××××× and despicable dreams, and thereby won the sympathy and assistance of the working masses and peace-loving countries all over the world. These are all proofs of the inevitable victory that has been brought out from our nation's self-reliance.

Second, our international environment is now developing in a favorable direction day by day. In these few months, we can see from all aspects that many facts that are beneficial to us are developing vigorously. We can summarize these facts into several aspects: (A) The internationalization of the anti-Japanese movements of the laboring masses and progressive political parties of various countries. They not only economically hit Japanese × products everywhere, but also refused to load and unload them, and politically urged their governments to implement effective sanctions against Japan. These movements were first launched in the United Kingdom and its colonies, and have now spread to any region in the world—except Germany and Italy. The great international anti-aggression conference held in London last winter was a general demonstration by peace-loving people all over the world against aggressionism. (B) Peace-loving democratic countries all over the world, such as Britain, the United States, and France, have gradually abandoned their isolationist policies and wait-and-see attitudes since President Roosevelt's famous speech was published, and have formed an international peace front against aggressionism. They deeply know that peace cannot be divided, and to guarantee world peace, it is necessary to guarantee peace in the Far East. Therefore, they have repeatedly used the collective security mechanism of the League of Nations, as well as specially convened the Nine-Power Conference, to support China. Not long after, Britain held naval exercises in Singapore, and the United States followed suit by resolving to expand its armaments. These facts are all indirectly giving China support. As for the Soviet Union, in essence, it is China's most sincere friend and the strongest fortress supporting human peace. Its support for China's national liberation revolutionary war is its consistent and unchanging stance. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact has given Japanese × another layer of concern. In addition, it uses all diplomatic means to strengthen the collective security system; consolidate the peace front; and universally mobilize the laboring masses and progressive political parties all over the world to give spiritual and material support to China's resistance. Its troops in the Far East have already given Japanese × a huge blow in the Zhanggufeng Incident. In addition, although Germany and Italy directly provide assistance to Japanese ×, they cannot do anything with the constraints of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Moreover, there are also mutual contradictions between them. Once Japanese ×'s aggression against China exceeds the limits they hope for, the aggression front itself is not without the possibility of disintegration. (C) The sympathy and assistance of the nationalities in various colonies for China is also becoming more and more widespread day by day. For example, the Union of South Africa and Australia, especially India and the Dutch East Indies, have launched economic sanctions against Japan, causing Japanese ×'s foreign trade to almost come to a standstill. They deeply know that the victory of China's resistance is a powerful prerequisite for the success of the ×× land revolution, and China's liberation is the most important link in the world ×× land liberation movement. Combining the above points, we can recognize and believe that we are fighting in an absolutely favorable international environment. It is very certain that this struggle will achieve victory. Moreover, the recent establishment of credit guarantee loans by Britain and the United States clearly shows that they are helping us and not allowing Japan to dominate East Asia. If Japanese × still does not realize this, perhaps Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union will unite to implement sanctions against this powerful × country!

Third, let us analyze our × people in detail again: Japanese × looks like a strong capitalist country on the surface, but if we carefully analyze its content, we can immediately see that it is a fragile country with congenital deficiencies. It lacks all the resources to build "aggressionism." The reason why it was able to complete the institutions of a capitalist country in just a few decades is entirely due to the use of historical opportunities and geographical advantages, and in these historical opportunities, it desperately carried out plunder wars using geographical advantages, so plunder wars can be regarded as having fulfilled the main task in the development of Japanese capitalism. It first obtained a large amount of monetary compensation and land cession in the Russo-Japanese War and the Sino-Japanese War, which formed the foundation of Japanese capitalism. Later, it used the opportunity of World War I to elevate itself to the stage of imperialism.

However, Japanese capitalism is still the most fragile link in international capitalist countries. Since the outbreak of the world capitalist economic panic in 1929, Japan's economy has fallen into a dead end. Britain, the United States, and other countries can still use economic policies to resolve their crises, but Japan is not qualified for this. It can only use × force to break out a bloody path. This is the reason for its recent active aggression against China, and it is also the reason for launching this large-scale aggression against China. It did not know that this aggression would be met with a bloody response from the Chinese government and people. It thought that it could complete its dream of conquering China in a short period of time, and it never imagined that China's long-term resistance would cause its national economic structure to collapse entirely. From the economic crisis reflected to the political crisis, ×

We know that the survival of Japanese × is entirely built on the invasion of China. However, since the beginning of the war, trade with China has completely stopped. Not only has trade with China stopped, but trade with other countries in the world has also suffered a serious blow from the anti-aggression movement and has been completely reduced. In addition, the orders returned due to the war are 100% in China and more than 50% in various parts of Nanyang. This surplus of foreign trade is completely gone. Secondly, the huge investment in China has also been completely destroyed in the war. For example, the properties of Japanese × in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Hankou have all been turned into ashes. As for the industrial aspect, only military industries are still struggling in Japan, while the remaining textile and gold industries have either encountered difficulties in the source of raw materials or have problems with sales channels, most of which have been completely closed down, and a small part has also greatly reduced production. In the agricultural aspect, the majority of farmers in rural areas have been forced to enlist, reducing the agricultural labor population, and production cannot continue to increase. Moreover, because of the collapse of industry, the sale of agricultural products has been affected, and because of the outflow of cash, the foreign exchange rate has fluctuated. The payment of differences in international trade and the purchase of military supplies all require cash payment; therefore, cash flows out day by day, thus affecting the depreciation of paper money and the fall of all securities. Especially after the closure of industries, the number of unemployed people will inevitably increase day by day. After the depreciation of paper money, the prices of goods on the market will rise, and workers will either be unemployed or have their wages reduced, thus increasing labor-capital conflicts and strike movements day by day. On the other hand, Japanese capitalists and warlords, for the continued progress of the war, still cannot but extract as much as possible from the poor peasants and workers. As far as we know, Japan's budget last year reached 5.47 billion yuan, of which military expenditure accounted for 70% of the total, and now it is more than this. Such a huge number has no second source other than being squeezed out of the Japanese laboring masses. Now the Japanese laboring masses have been squeezed dry. In short, Japan's national finances have lost the solid foundation of the national economy, the national budget has exceeded the extent that the people can bear, and public debt and all kinds of exorbitant taxes have reached the saturation point and can no longer be digested. Therefore, the money and materials extracted have all been squeezed clean, and it has lost the material basis for continuing the war!

Looking at it from the above aspects in summary: First, from the self-reliance of China's resistance itself; second, from the favorable international environment of China's resistance; third, from the economic and political crisis of our × people, we are confident in obtaining the final victory of our resistance. However, it is not enough for us to rely solely on the development of these objective conditions. What is important is that we must make the greatest efforts subjectively. What we should strive for is: First, how to make our strength grow and become stronger in the development of resistance. All theories and actions that are sufficient to hinder this self-reliance must be swept away. Second, how should we establish our victorious diplomatic line, quickly connect with people's organizations and progressive political parties of various countries, and promote them to oppose their governments' isolationist policies and wavering attitudes. Third, how should we get in touch with the oppressed laboring masses inside our × country and strengthen their anti-war movement. Now our resistance has entered a new stage, which can also be said to be a stage close to victory. From the failures of the past year and a half, we have learned many valuable lessons. The previous failures have formed the basis for our future victory. I believe that my assessment of the inevitable victory of our resistance is a correct assessment. As long as each of us holds the determination to fight for national liberation, the final victory will definitely belong to us!

### The Youth Salvation Movement in Chaoshan

— Zhang Wenqiang

Without a unified organization or unified leadership, this was a shortcoming of the Chaoshan Youth Salvation Movement in the past. Originally, the Chaoshan youth had long had the demand for a unified organization. Last year, in January, a representative conference of youth resistance associations from various counties and cities was held in Shantou. It was originally scheduled that the conference of representatives would produce the Lingdong Youth Anti-× Comrades Succession Association, but at that time, the Shantou people's anti-× support association, for some reason, actually sent a letter to the police station to stop the meeting. The conference could not be held, and the general association could not be produced. Only three people were selected by the representatives in an informal meeting to organize the Lingdong Youth Anti-× Comrades Association Correspondence Office as a substitute for the general association. However, due to the overly simple organization, the Lingqing Correspondence Office at that time could not assume the responsibility of leadership, and the Chaoshan youth were still working in a scattered situation.

China's politics have progressed with the development of the War of Resistance. Last year, on the anniversary of August 13th, the Chaoshan Youth Resistance Association's representative conference was actually held under the leadership of party, government, and military officers. Although the Youth Resistance General Association has not yet been successfully organized, the organization of the Lingqing Correspondence Office has been improved and has become a truly leading organ of the Chaoshan Youth Salvation Movement. At the same time, the Youth Resistance Associations in various counties have also been unified. Affiliated relationships have developed from counties to districts, and from districts to villages; the village Youth Resistance accepts the leadership of the district Youth Resistance, the district Youth Resistance accepts the leadership of the county Youth Resistance, and the county Youth Resistance accepts the leadership of the Lingqing Correspondence Office. The Chaoshan Youth Salvation Movement has been unified since then.

Cultivating Cadres and Allocating Cadres

"Cadres decide everything," this is a famous saying containing truth, tasted from the rich experience of revolutionary struggle. The developmental form of the Chaoshan Youth Salvation Movement is determined by the cadres. Therefore, the Chaoshan youth in the struggle pay extremely close attention to the cultivation of cadres.

Only youth forged in struggle can become a strong and capable cadre. Chaoshan youth have always cultivated cadres through practical work. In 1937, two work teams were organized to follow the army. One was a work team stationed with the 155th Division in Chaoshan, and the other was a work team going north with the army, following the 156th Division to work on the eastern battlefield. The purpose of organizing the two work teams was to take on the responsibility of bridging the military and the people, filling the past gap between the military and the people, so that the military and the people could cooperate closely, rise up together, and eliminate × people. At the same time, taking advantage of the convenience of following the army, the masses were more widely and deeply awakened and organized. The work team going north with the army was disbanded and returned after the fall of Nanjing. The work team following the 155th Division was changed to the work team following the 157th Division since the 157th Division took over Chaoshan last February, and was also announced to be disbanded this April due to economic reasons. The achievements of the above two work teams are of course indelible, and it is especially valuable that each team member has been forged into a strong cadre in the work.

In order to obtain richer struggle experience, the Chaoshan youth especially encouraged a large number of comrades to go to the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in northern Shaanxi to study. Go to the New Fourth Army to participate in guerrilla warfare. They have enriched their experience and strengthened their abilities in actual struggles in the Northwest and Jiangnan. When the Anti-Japanese War in Chaoshan needs them, they will come back to defend their hometown, because working in their hometown can exert more power.

In addition to cultivating cadres through work, Chaoshan youth can also seize every opportunity for short-term special training. Various training classes held by the government, such as the Civil Movement Work Cadre Training Class of the Guangdong Party, Government, and Military Joint Conference, the Self-Defense Personnel Cadre Training Institute and Women's Cadre Training Institute of the Eighth District Self-Defense Corps Command Office, the Training Corps of the Ninth District Self-Defense Corps, and the War Zone Service Corps of the 157th Division, the Youth Resistance Associations in various places in Chaoshan have planned to send members to participate in the training, so that they can become cadres with special skills and trusted by the government.

Another purpose of members of the Youth Resistance Association participating in various cadre trainings is to allocate cadres. The purpose of various training classes held by the government is to cultivate cadre talents for various civil movement work, and after graduation, they are assigned to work in various places. This will disperse the members of the Youth Association to various places, stand in a legal position, directly lead the broad masses, and earnestly implement all the government's anti-war orders.

Difficulties Felt

In a representative meeting, dozens of representatives of the Youth Resistance Associations of various counties and cities in Chaoshan gathered to report the difficulties in the progress of the Youth Resistance Associations in various places. Summarizing, there are roughly the following points: 1. Obstruction by feudal forces; 2. Lack of cadres; 3. Financial difficulties. (To be continued)

### Protesting × Invasion of Hainan Island, Britain and France Discuss Unified Attitude, Several French Warships Arrive at Haikou, French Ambassador Questions Japan's Intentions

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 11th] The French Foreign Ministry received definite information this afternoon that French warships are still anchored off Hainan Island and will be able to clearly understand all circumstances when the Japanese land. At present, Britain and France are discussing how to lodge a protest with Japan.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 11th] According to reliable sources, the French government has instructed the French ambassador in Tokyo to ask the Japanese government about the period of stationing of Japanese troops on Hainan Island and the extent of military operations.

[Associated Press, Paris, 11th] Regarding the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island, the French government had not yet decided last night whether to lodge a direct and separate protest, or to issue a "diplomatic declaration," or to coordinate with Britain and jointly protest to Japan. According to official sources, France currently does not seem to want to "cause trouble," but only to lodge a protest with Japan.

[Associated Press, Paris, 11th] French officials stated that France is currently working to avoid and eliminate the threat of German and Italian forces to its European territories, and the sudden occupation of Hainan Island by the Japanese army has made France even more difficult and anxious. At present, the number of warships stationed in Annam by France is not large, and the military strength is only about 35,000 people. The Foreign Minister stated last week that France is determined to do its best to protect its interests in various places, so this matter has attracted the attention of the general public. The Foreign Ministry is studying reports from all parties in detail.

[Local News] According to the De Chen Western Newspaper in Hong Kong yesterday morning, a radio report was received yesterday morning that several French warships had arrived at Haikou, the number and type of which are unknown, but all seemed to be from Guangzhou Bay.

Britain and France Take Consistent Action, French Opinion Leaders Make Suggestions to the Government

[Reuters, Paris, 11th] French newspapers have recently launched major attacks on the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island. They suggested that France should cooperate with Britain and lodge a serious protest with Tokyo. The "News" stated that Britain and France should take joint defensive actions in the Far East. Several other newspapers pointed out that the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island and the Italian occupation of Milos (located in the Mediterranean) are both "common conspiracies of the Axis powers."

Britain and France Take Consistent Action, French Opinion Leaders Make Suggestions to the Government

[Haitong News Agency, London, 11th] The newspapers here on Saturday morning carried lengthy articles on the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island. According to the Times diplomatic correspondent, the loss of the island affects British and French rights, as navigation to Vietnam and Guangzhou Bay will be restricted. Recalling that in June last year, British Foreign Secretary Butler declared in the House of Lords that the British and French governments had warned Japan that the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island would inevitably cause undesirable conflicts. It also stated that if the situation forced it, Britain and France must provide practical assistance to each other to deal with various disputes. It also stated that the government is currently reviewing whether the Japanese army's occupation of the island affects British and French rights, and whether the Japanese government's guarantee of no territorial ambition can be realized.

British House of Commons to Discuss, Members Plan to Ensure Government Takes Clear Action

[Central News Agency, London, 11th] British officials do not want to make any criticisms regarding the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island before receiving accurate reports. However, officials said that since Japan first threatened Hainan Island last June, Japan has repeatedly hinted that Japan would inevitably use military reasons as an excuse to land on Hainan Island sooner or later. However, Japan stated every time it hinted that Japan had no intention of permanently occupying the island. Japan's actions this time will inevitably arouse opposition from the British and French Houses of Commons. According to reports, some members of the British House of Commons do not pay much attention to Far Eastern events, but they are particularly concerned about the integrity of Hainan Island. The issue of the Japanese army's occupation of the island is expected to be raised for discussion in the House of Commons next Monday. It is heard that members will urge the government to immediately take clear action to implement the resolutions submitted by Britain and France to Japan last year. It is still recalled that after Japan first threatened Hainan Island last year, France immediately dispatched troops to occupy the islands under its jurisdiction.

### Qiongya's Isolated Army Fights Hard, × Suffers Fierce Resistance

[Guangzhou Bay, 11th] Foreign News. Late last night, a telegram came to Haikou, officially confirming that Japanese troops had occupied Haikou and Qiongzhou on Hainan Island. At dawn yesterday, Japanese troops landed at Lingao, west of Haikou, and Qinglan Port, southeast of it. Immediately, a fierce battle broke out between the Chinese and Japanese armies. Although the number of Chinese defenders was small, they resolutely defended the key points to resist, waiting for reinforcements from Qiongzhou. It is difficult for Hong Kong to transmit that the × army suffered deaths, but according to reliable sources here, the × naval landing force reached Lin Gao, and at least 100 people have died. Before the Chinese army retreated to the island, they continued to shoot at the Japanese army with machine guns. On the Qinglan Port side, the Chinese army also resolutely resisted, and both sides suffered casualties. When the Japanese army landed, in addition to the battleships firing artillery, Japanese planes also launched large-scale attacks. After the Japanese army landed, they used trucks to attack Qiongzhou along the highway. The Chinese army in Qiongzhou bravely resisted with small field guns and machine guns, but due to the small number of people, they had to retreat to the interior. Japanese planes carried out large-scale bombing in Haikou and Qiongzhou. It was reported last night that several houses caught fire, and the situation in the city was very chaotic. Residents moved to the interior one after another, leaving many items along the way.

[Guangzhou Bay, 11th] Foreign News. This morning, the wireless here received news that shelling could still be heard in Haikou, and many believed that the Chinese army was still resisting in the suburbs of Haikou and Qiongzhou.

Small Groups of Guangdong × Intruding and Harassing Fail

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 11th] On the morning of the 9th, more than 300 of the × infantry, cavalry, and artillery from Shilong, Dongguan, invaded Liuhe Market in Boluo County, and a part harassed Futian Chang. Our self-defense corps attacked in separate directions, capturing many of them. × could not hold out and retreated in the original direction.

[Central News Agency, Source, 10th] At 7 a.m. on the 9th, more than 1,000 × infantry, cavalry, and artillery, led by Fu He Xu, between Conghua and Zengcheng, advanced on Pai. Our army resisted bravely, and the fierce battle was fierce, with heavy casualties on both sides. Then, × fired hundreds of large cannons, and our positions were destroyed. There was no danger to defend. We withdrew from Pai Tan. At 2 p.m. on the 10th, our reinforcements counterattacked, and a fierce battle broke out with × near Gaotan Market, north of Pai Tan. They are still in stalemate.

### Intentionally Making Things Difficult for France

—American Observer—

[United Press Washington, 11th] Since the news of the Japanese army landing on Hainan Island was transmitted, people here are quite surprised, as it was generally believed that there had been a recent understanding between Japan and France. That is, the French side agreed to prevent Chinese military supplies from being transported through Annam, while the Japanese side agreed to guarantee the neutrality of Hainan Island. The Chinese authorities have long expressed dissatisfaction with Annam's prevention of Chinese military supplies from passing through, and overseas Chinese in Annam have also strongly opposed this matter. People here believe that the Japanese army's move is actually intended to make things difficult for France.

### He Guoguang Takes Office, Flies to Chengdu Yesterday

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 11th] He Guoguang, Director of the Chairman's Chengdu Provisional Headquarters, along with his entourage, left Chongqing at approximately 9:00 AM on the 11th to fly to Chengdu to take office.

### Muli Tusi Representatives Fly to Chongqing to Present Flag, Jin Citizens Pay Respects to Senior Officials, Long Yun Issues Statement Yesterday

[Our Newspaper Kunming, 11th Special Dispatch] The Muli Tusi has decided to send representatives to Chongqing to present a flag to the leader and the frontline soldiers to pay their respects. Long Yun issued an important statement this evening, which has been sent out by the Central News Agency.

[Min Ge She, 11th Dispatch] Last December, × invaded Jixian County. Yan Xishan, Commander-in-Chief of the Second War Area, used new national revolutionary tactics to crush the × people's siege. The local people praised the senior officer for his resolute command and heroic resistance to the ×. Therefore, they presented a satin plaque inscribed with the four characters "Meritorious Service." Representatives were sent to pay respects to the Commander-in-Chief, who personally received them. In addition to expressing his gratitude, he gave a speech to the people, declaring his determination to resist and his grasp of the final victory, and encouraged military-civilian cooperation and united resistance until the end.

### × Invasion of Hainan Island, US Government Attaches Great Importance, Defense Experts Study Western Pacific Situation, Defense Plans for Philippine Islands and Guam May Be Strengthened

[United Press Washington, 11th] According to US defense experts, if Japan establishes naval and air force bases on Hainan Island, then the new US defense plans for the Philippine Islands and Guam should be reconsidered. It is generally believed that the Japanese military's move is sufficient to encourage the American people to be more sympathetic to the government's plan to defend Guam in order to protect the Philippines. On the other hand, some people believe that the Japanese military's move is intended to coerce various countries to readjust the situation in the Pacific and stop the Sino-Japanese War. Perhaps the Japanese side wants to use this to coerce the United States to stop defending Guam. The US government is unwilling to comment until the true purpose of the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island is clear, as it is questionable whether the Japanese military will permanently occupy the island. If the Japanese military permanently occupies the island and establishes naval and air force bases on the island, US officials believe that the Philippines, Annam, and Hong Kong will all be threatened, and the military situation in the Western Pacific will need to be readjusted.

[Central News Agency Washington, 10th] The US government is unwilling to criticize the Japanese military's landing on Hainan Island until the Japanese side declares its true purpose and whether Japan will permanently occupy the island. However, if Japan develops a naval base on Hainan Island, the military positions of the Western Pacific powers will be drastically changed as a result. Therefore, the air force base will pose a threat to the Philippines, Annam, and Hong Kong. However, some officials believe that the Japanese military's occupation of Hainan Island is similar to its occupation of Shanghai and Guangzhou, that is, although it infringes on the interests of Western powers, it may not infringe on the sovereignty of the powers. However, if Japan permanently occupies the island in order to drive out Western forces, the situation will be very different.

### Twelfth Group Army Attacks × with Surprise Troops

[Wengyuan Quick Report] A certain division of the 12th Group Army dispatched troops on the night of the 5th to attack × from Honghe in separate directions towards Zhongluotan and Taipingchang. The First Battalion advanced to the vicinity of Zhongluotan at 1:00 AM on the 6th, bravely attacking and breaking into a corner of the ×'s position. The × troops responded in a panic and were extremely chaotic. Subsequently, the × troops transported more than 300 × soldiers from the Taihe City area in armored vehicles to reinforce them. For a time, the battle became more intense. Our army bravely charged and killed more than 100 × officers and soldiers, and the ×'s momentum was thwarted. After a stalemate until dawn, our army burned the ferry barracks and bridges near the ×'s position and withdrew to its original position. In this battle, our company commander Fang Zhongping was killed, company commander Lao Yaoming was wounded, and more than 20 soldiers were wounded. The Second Battalion advanced to the vicinity of Taipingchang at 3:00 AM on the 6th, catching the × by surprise and launching a fierce attack on them. The × stubbornly resisted by relying on nets, firing artillery aimlessly at us all night, firing a total of five or six hundred rounds. We believed that the purpose of depleting the × people had been achieved, and we also safely withdrew to our original position before dawn.

### Philippine Compatriots Respond to "One Yuan to Repay Debt" with Honor, $100,000 USD Remitted to Chongqing

[United Press Manila, 11th] Yang Guangsheng, the Chinese Consul General here, announced today that he has remitted $100,000 USD to Chongqing as a repayment of the US loan for Chinese export credit. This remittance was raised by overseas Chinese in the Philippines in response to the "One Yuan to Repay Debt Movement."

### American Dockworkers Help Us Sanction Japanese ×, National Diplomacy Association Sends Telegram to Thank Them

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 11th] Two cargo ships in the Long Beach port of California, USA, previously planned to load 1,200 tons of scrap iron to Japan, but the dockworkers refused to transport the scrap iron onto the ships. Several thousand workers also set up a cordon at the dock. The Chinese National Diplomacy Association recently sent a telegram to express its gratitude and hopes to continue its efforts to unite dockworkers across the United States to expand this movement.

### American Residents in Chongqing Send Telegram to Roosevelt, Requesting to Stop Atrocities

[United Press Chongqing, 11th] American residents here recently jointly sent a telegram to President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Senators Pittman and Reynolds, requesting that they stop the Japanese from indiscriminately bombing China. The original telegram stated: "Japanese bombing of Guiyang and Wanxian, the use of incendiary bombs, thousands of innocent civilians were burned to death, and women and children were strafed by machine guns. The past policy of the United States, following the same old routine, is tantamount to participating in the crimes of Japan. In the name of humanity and world peace, we ask you to quickly stop the export of oil, iron, and other materials to Japan."

### Japanese Consul General in Shanghai Protests to French Consul, Requests Interference in Concession Administration, Stepped Up Arrests of Patriotic Elements

[United Press Shanghai, 11th] The Japanese Consul General here has made an oral request to the French Consul General, requesting the French Concession authorities to step up efforts to eliminate terrorists within the Concession, as terrorists have been extremely active in the past two weeks, killing many pro-Japanese puppet officials. It is reported that the French authorities replied that some shootings occurred in Japanese-occupied areas and hoped that the Japanese authorities would pay special attention to them.

### × Izumo Battleship Violently Hit by French Ship, Chrysanthemum Crest on Bow Destroyed, Anchor Cable Broken

[Central News Agency Chongqing, 10th] Shanghai dispatch, the Japanese flagship Izumo nearly met with an accident in the Huangpu River today. At 4:00 PM today, the French merchant ship Asushima No. 2 sailed into the Huangpu River and, due to a navigational error, violently collided with the front of the Izumo battleship. The gold chrysanthemum crest on the bow was destroyed, and the anchor cable was also broken. Fortunately, the battleship immediately dropped another spare anchor, thus avoiding danger. According to reports, the French ship was sailing from the port to this area when it saw a sailboat sailing straight towards the engine of the ship. The ship stopped the engine's rotation for fear of an accident. Unexpectedly, the ship leaned over and could not be stopped. A hole was pierced in the starboard side of the stern of the Asushima No. 2. Afterwards, the shipowner, Mr. Kilin, personally boarded the Japanese battleship to apologize.

### Old Mr. Wang Delin, Who Died of Illness at the Front

— Liu Qiguang

(Xi'an Aviation News)

Speaking of Mr. Wang Delin, everyone will immediately think of the Northeast Volunteer Army, because he was one of the four leaders of the Northeast Volunteer Army that year. Moreover, he was different from the senior military officers turned volunteer army leaders such as Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, and Li Du. He was a grassroots hero who rose from the bottom and, with a call to arms, won the support of more than 100,000 sons and daughters of the borderland who were unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation. He had never read books, did not understand politics, had no airs, and was a thorough country old man in appearance. He was a good man to people, but a ball of fire to things. He didn't know what political parties were, let alone why "brothers should quarrel." He only knew, "We are Chinese, and Chinese should love China." If someone infringes on China's interests, it is his irreconcilable enemy. When Imperial Russia laid the Chinese Eastern Railway and invaded China, he once led troops to resist, causing the Tsarist government to send envoys to seek peace before giving up. However, if he knew that Russians had bullied Chinese compatriots, traffic on the Chinese Eastern Railway would usually be disrupted. Later, he helped the Bolshevik Party to eliminate the White Russians on the opposite bank of the Heilongjiang River. His only motive was to take the opportunity to retaliate against Imperial Russia, which had bullied the Chinese people. In fact, he did not know what the political position of the Bolshevik Party was, let alone approve of the revolution. His great sense of loving the country and loving his compatriots always controlled his lifelong behavior. Therefore, although he had been a ×× for more than ten years and had a strong influence along the Heilongjiang River, the local people never had any resentment towards him. The generous gifts that the Tsarist government sent him every season not only became the supplies for his subordinates but also became the food and clothing for the local poor. After the September 18th Incident, he disregarded everything and rose up to resist Japan, which was also the highest expression of his innate patriotism.

This admirable national hero has already bid farewell to his 450 million compatriots. He died in a guerrilla base behind the Japanese lines. Attending to him in his dying moments were forty to fifty of his close followers from Qilu who were unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation. Under the armed guard of his subordinates and under the constant threat of the Japanese, he ended his 64-year life. When he was on his last breath, he muttered, "× his mother, don't let a single × soldier go back."

Mr. Wang died. Mr. Wang, who first launched the war of resistance after the September 18th Incident, died for the survival of the country and the dignity of the nation. However, his lifelong spirit of unremitting struggle for the country and the nation will last forever. Inheriting this great spiritual heritage and sacrificing everything for the independence, freedom, and happiness of the country and the nation should be the inescapable responsibility of every Chinese son and daughter who dies later!

Mr. Wang Delin started the Anti-Japanese War about a month after the September 18th Incident. At that time, he was a battalion commander of the Jilin Provincial Defense Army, stationed near Yanji, Jilin, bordering Korea. After the Japanese occupied the Northeast, for strategic needs, they wanted to build a railway from Huining, Korea, to Yanji. The route predetermined by the Japanese happened to pass through Mr. Wang's defense area. At that time, the Japanese still thought that the Chinese could be bought with money and status, so they sent personnel to visit Mr. Wang at the defense post, respectfully sending a large number of gifts, and promised that after the completion of the Jihui Road, Mr. Wang would be promoted to the position of "Road Protection Commander." Mr. Wang pretended to agree. The next day, more than 200 Japanese soldiers escorted the survey team to start surveying the route. Mr. Wang took advantage of the Japanese's unpreparedness and mobilized his troops to surround the Japanese closely, firing the first shot of the Anti-Japanese War and sacrificing more than 200 Japanese as a flag sacrifice. Thus, he continued to fight with the Japanese army that was "suppressing bandits" until the first month of the 21st year. The Japanese not only failed to eliminate his strength but instead increased his strength from four or five hundred people to seventy or eighty thousand people. At this time, Mr. Wang was supported by everyone as the "Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese National Salvation Army" and fought in the territory of Jilin. The following winter, his troops had increased to 150,000 to 160,000, and the defense area was gradually forced to move from southeastern Jilin to the northeast. Finally, due to the lack of military supplies and the difficulty in supplying the soldiers, he was defeated and entered Soviet territory under the large-scale attack of the Japanese. Although Mr. Wang failed, more than 100,000 Northeast soldiers under his leadership still broke up into smaller units and remained in various parts of the Northeast to continue the Anti-Japanese War. The current leaders of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army, such as Zhou ××, Li ××, Wu ××, and Wang ××, were all cadres who followed him in the past.

In June of the 23rd year, Mr. Wang returned to China via Europe. Wherever he passed, he received a warm welcome from all walks of life, especially from overseas Chinese in various parts of Nanyang. In July, he assumed the new post of Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Volunteer Army in Guangzhou. In September, he left Guangzhou for Shanghai, running around Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, planning to take a boat to Vladivostok and return to the Northeast to continue leading the Anti-Japanese War. Due to various reasons, he was unable to succeed. Later, he was appointed as a consultant to the Military Affairs Commission and lived in Nanjing for a short time. However, his enthusiasm for the Anti-Japanese War never wavered. While in Nanjing, he twice met with the Soviet Ambassador to discuss the possibility of passing through the Soviet Union, but he was unable to fulfill his wish.

Mr. Wang was very poor. When he was in Nanjing, his family of seven and more than ten followers were crowded into a flat of 25 yuan a month. For daily life, in addition to the 90-odd yuan a month for travel expenses from the Electric Power Committee, there was a subsidy of 150 yuan a month from the Northeast Salvation Association. In the winter of the 25th year, the old troops who had retreated into Soviet territory with him returned from Vladivostok in a steady stream, and they all lived on the floor of Mr. Wang's residence, sending away one batch after another, simply exhausting him to the point where he could not even afford rice porridge. Fortunately, the old troops who returned to China later were all sent back to their hometowns by the Military Affairs Commission, so he was able to breathe a sigh of relief.

After the Battle of Suiyuan-East, Mr. Wang was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot, unable to settle down for a moment. "× his mother, ×× are getting more and more fierce. Are the Chinese people so uncompetitive? × his mother, we have to do it, we have to do it!" He always said this to every friend he met.

He had a very close relationship with Mr. Ma Xiangbo and Mr. Ding Weifen. Later, with their assistance, he took two followers and rushed to Suiyuan. He originally wanted to return to Jilin via Rehe from Suiyuan to lead his old troops to respond to the Anti-Japanese War. When he arrived in Guihua and met with General Fu Zuoyi, he learned that the Suiyuan War had ended in victory. He could not realize his wish to return to the Northeast for the time being. After visiting the officers and soldiers who participated in the Anti-Japanese War at that time, he quickly returned to Beiping.

When he arrived in Beiping, at the invitation of Mr. Song Zheyuan, he stayed in the old capital and was appointed as an advisor to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. While in Beiping, he sent people back to the Northeast to make contact, and the old troops outside the pass often sent people to Guan to report everything. At that time, he still tried every means to get out of Guan, but he never achieved his goal.

After the Lugouqiao Incident, he immediately sent people back to Shandong to recruit the old troops who had returned from Saibei in preparation for the Anti-Japanese War. However, unexpectedly, Tianjin and Beiping were abandoned, and the old man was left in Beiping, exposed to the direct threat of the brutal ××. At that time, his friends believed that the situation was ominous and tried to rescue him in every possible way, but his whereabouts were never known. Later, he disguised himself and escaped back to Nanjing in September.

In October, the Northeast ×× was established in Zhengzhou. At the urging of Chen ××, Mr. Wang took over as the Commander-in-Chief of the Second ×× Region's Restoration Army and once again prepared to go out of Guan to kill ×. Unfortunately, the ×× ended immediately, and Mr. Wang's plan had to be postponed again.

After countless failures, he knew that his wish to go out of Guan could not be fulfilled easily, and the situation of the Anti-Japanese War became more and more tense. Finally, he resolutely abandoned his original plan and went from Zhengzhou to Xuzhou, rushing back to his hometown in Yishui, southern Shandong, to gather the children of his hometown and the old troops who had returned from the north to begin guerrilla warfare against the Japanese after Han Fuju abandoned Shandong. At this time, he had no official title and no funds. He led his fellow villagers to fight the Japanese as an ordinary citizen, and his daily life was to supply his subordinates and the elders of his hometown. His subordinate Zhang × was a brave and good at fighting general. During the Anti-Japanese War in the Northeast, he had established the miraculous feat of rushing into the Japanese camp alone and capturing the Japanese captain alive. This tiger general also had brilliant achievements in the guerrilla warfare in southern Shandong.

After the retreat from Xuzhou, General Shi ×× led his troops to station in southern Shandong. At that time, Mr. Wang was suffering from illness due to years of running around and fighting the Anti-Japanese War. He handed over all his troops to Zhang × to be directly commanded by General Shi, and he only took a few close followers back to his relatives' home in Beishizhuang, Nanyong Township, Yishui, to recuperate.

Mr. Wang was originally very strong. When he first arrived in Nanjing, although he was already in his twilight years at the age of sixty-one, he did not have a single white hair. However, because his ambition was not fulfilled, his hair turned gray within half a year, and his spirit and body gradually became unsustainable. After suffering from illness in southern Shandong, although he left the army to recuperate, he finally died of a severe attack of old illness on December 20th of last winter due to old age and blood loss.

Mr. Wang's name was Huimin. He left Guan at the age of twenty and spent forty years in the Northeast. He knew the geography of the Northeast, especially the two provinces of Heilongjiang and Jilin, very well, and he had many friendships with the elders of the area. His wife, Liu Yujie, gave birth to three sons and three daughters, all of whom were young. They are now exiled in Xi'an, living at No. 653 Dongda Street. Mr. Wang was selfless and never considered family life. Now his family of six, widow and orphans, are extremely pitiful. It is hoped that the people of the court and the field will pity the descendants of the national hero who fought with ×× throughout his life and provide them with assistance.

### Special Feature: The New World War (Part 2)

— Chen Youren

The empires that Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and militarist-dominated Japan seek to establish can only succeed if the British and French empires collapse, the Soviet Union disintegrates, China is completely conquered and destroyed, and the naval power of the United States in the Pacific is eliminated. Germany has already annexed Austria, dismembered Czechoslovakia, and is now conspiring with Italy to subject Spain to foreign domination in a way that Spain has never seen before in its history. Italy has also conquered Abyssinia and forced Britain and France to recognize the conquered territory in a humiliating manner unprecedented in their glorious history. Now, it is actively preparing to provoke France formally over the issues of Tunisia, Nice, and Djibouti. As for Japan, it is not only ravaging China but, as Matsuoka Yosuke said, is implementing a policy of excluding white powers from Asia.

This is an explanation of the current world situation. This explanation can make people understand the violence of the aggressor nations, their illegal thoughts and actions, and their contempt for Britain and France—one aggressor nation even happily called Britain and France declining powers.

(6) Concrete Facts

The apparent victories of the aggressor nations and the missteps of British and French politicians, their inability to make decisive decisions, and their diplomatic humiliation can all be proven by concrete facts. When Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese military openly launched wars, and since the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact, this war has become a new world war. However, on the side of the peaceful nations, they regarded these actions as accidental diplomatic incidents and local struggles, as if they were unrelated to each other, like the people of Qin viewing the fat of the people of Yue. Thus, at the Beijing Conference, French Foreign Minister Daladier only referred to the brutal war of aggression launched by Japan in China as a local struggle!

In other words, Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese militarists are not only launching a world war, but also demonstrating in their actions and decisions the characteristics of historical military leaders. However, London, Paris, and Washington are not seeking ways to win this ongoing war. Sadly, they are still vainly trying to avoid war!

Preparing for a future war and preparing for an offensive in a war are not the same. To illustrate this difference, the last World War was launched in the summer of 1918, but the final offensive by the Allied powers to force Germany to sue for peace cannot be said to have been fully prepared before the summer of 1918. The Allied powers spent four years preparing for their final counter-offensive. Now, General Göring of Germany has been working for four years on the offensive of the totalitarian powers in the current war, which is surprising and noteworthy. According to the views of the Nazi and Fascist military, this war must be sudden, with a significant disparity in strength, and can be resolved in a short period.

(7) Fear Psychology

Is the democratic countries' failure to grasp the great reality of this new world war due to the fact that the previous European war has given British and French politicians moral or psychological trauma? Or is it that the democratic countries of greater Europe cannot produce leaders like Hitler, Mussolini, and the militarists of the Tokyo Shogunate? Are Hitler, Mussolini, and Itagaki truly superhuman beings beyond the reach of ordinary people?

No, Hitler and Mussolini are not particularly sound. However, when the leaders of the democratic countries loathe war and have an extreme fear of war—to the extent that they do not believe things they dare not believe—Hitler and others seized upon the mistakes of others and were able to step onto the stage of history.

This fear psychology led British and French politicians to misunderstand the historical facts created by Hitler, Mussolini, and the Japanese militarists, and they continued to suggest to them things like "overall solutions," "gentlemen's agreements," and "international concessions" to discuss what they called unfair issues. Hitler and others want to create their new empire with the Nazi blade, the Fascist aircraft, and the methods of Japanese barbarism. This will to create a new empire is certainly not something that can be controlled by diplomatic rhetoric and political fantasies.

(8) Non-Intervention Policy

What is more striking to people's intellect than the British and French policy of non-intervention in the Spanish war? German and Italian troops have invaded Spain, and according to Mussolini and the recent speech by the U.S. Secretary of State, the mission of the German and Italian troops is to overthrow democratic Spain. However, for the past two years, London and Paris have avoided mentioning the existence of these troops, in order to prove that their so-called non-intervention policy can avoid war—in fact, war would not have occurred if the combined strength of Germany and Italy could not have consistently matched the combined strength of the three major democratic powers of Britain, France, and Russia.

With the same purpose as the above commentary, let me criticize the attitude of the Western democratic countries towards the Japanese invasion of China. A year ago, I gave a speech in Paris, and I could not help but say to the audience: "Please forgive me, from the standpoint of a Chinese person, I feel that the principles adopted by the Western democratic countries are vulgar, foolish, selfish, and self-serving principles. Not only Britain and France are like this, but also the policy of the United States is the same. They all believe that the work of slaughter by Japan in China is only an undeclared local struggle, and that their interests are not related. Although more than 300,000 Chinese lives have been killed by Japanese aircraft and artillery, and tens of thousands of Chinese women have given birth to children on the streets of Shanghai and other open places, the principle of non-intervention must be observed if the interests of Britain, France, and the United States are not harmed. The suffering of the Chinese people is indeed difficult to calculate. In addition to the above, according to the Director of Intelligence of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, there are also 30 million Chinese people in the Shanghai-Nanjing area who are homeless in this severe winter. Think about it; 30 million Chinese people, equal to a quarter of the entire US population and three-quarters of the entire French population, are ravaged by cruel [omitted characters], causing them to be displaced!" Since I gave my speech in Paris, more than one million Chinese people have been massacred by the Japanese army, and more than 60 million have been displaced.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 11th] According to a responsible official here, Italy will present a demand to France on the condition of withdrawing its volunteer troops from Spain. Some believe that Mussolini is now quite willing to compromise with France as soon as possible, so his demand should not cause a serious crisis. According to reliable political circles, Italy has no intention of seizing Spanish territory or economic sovereignty. It only hopes to obtain considerable rewards in addition to assisting Franco.

[Reuters, Washington, 11th] Mrs. Roosevelt today published an article in her newspaper defending the Spanish government, which caused quite a stir here. Mrs. Roosevelt said that she "happily" accepted a copy of Goya's prints presented by the Spanish ambassador, regardless of opposing opinions. Mrs. Roosevelt concluded, "As far as I know, we should indeed call the Spanish government a democratic government. Although it once expressed opposition to religion, it has now been completely corrected."

[Associated Press, Valencia, 11th] Spanish Prime Minister Negrín and military leader General Miaja, after holding an important meeting, decided to continue the resistance to the end, defend the "central region," and immediately begin to recruit women to participate in military service.

[Reuters, Madrid, 11th] Since Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister Álvarez del Vayo arrived in the "central region," the people of Madrid have been engaged in various preparations to continue the resistance. The government has appointed General Miaja as the commander-in-chief of the army, navy, and air force, which shows the determination to resist to the end. The morale of the people is also extremely high. The newspapers here all pointed out that the government is still very strong, hoping that the military and civilians will unite and make the greatest efforts. Prime Minister Negrín declared today that the resistance will continue until the conditions resolved by the Spanish Parliament on February 2 are met. These conditions are the withdrawal of foreign troops and allowing the Spanish people to freely choose their form of government.

[Central News Agency, Madrid, 11th] Spanish Prime Minister Negrín announced today that Madrid is the capital of the government.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 11th] Last Friday evening, a report was received here from Valencia stating that the political and party organs in the central part of Spain had expressed their determination to continue fighting to the government and sent telegrams to all parties requesting them to do their best to resist any foreign oppression. It is rumored that the Director of Counter-Espionage of the Spanish government, Domingo, arrived in Murcia via Catalonia. It is also reported that a ship from Minorca carrying about 100 Spanish government officials arrived in North Algeria last night and will transfer to Aran. Also, after Spanish Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister Álvarez del Vayo arrived in Valencia, they used a radio broadcast to appeal to the people of the whole country, while announcing the government's return to Madrid, and saying that no matter how difficult it is, they must continue the resistance to defend Spanish liberalism.

[Reuters, Perpignan, 10th] The Spanish rebel army occupied Puigcerdà this afternoon. The town is still on fire. The rebels then occupied Bellver de Cerdanya. It is reported that Spanish Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister Álvarez del Vayo have gone to Madrid to meet with General Miaja and other senior commanders. They want to know the status of the military supplies and morale. This afternoon, rebel aircraft dropped hundreds of bombs on Valencia. A telegram was then received stating that Negrín and Álvarez del Vayo had arrived in Valencia.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 11th] German Ambassador Dirksen informed the British Foreign Secretary yesterday that Germany would continue to pay for the expenses of the Spanish War Non-Intervention Committee. Rumors from outside should not be believed.

### American Ships Concentrated in the Caribbean. Drills to Begin Next Week. The Largest Scale in History. British and French Naval Exercises Held Simultaneously.

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] Most of the American fleet has been concentrated in the Caribbean, preparing to begin drills next week. This is the largest American naval exercise in history. It is noteworthy that Britain and France will also hold naval exercises simultaneously. The exercise location for Britain is in the Mediterranean, and for France, it is in the area from Marseille to North Africa.

The black team will be responsible for defending the Panama Canal, and the white team will be responsible for attacking, attempting to establish a base there.

### National Defense Plan. Senate Military Committee. Resolution Not to Publicize.

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] The United States Senate Military Affairs Committee agreed to disclose all information obtained by the committee during its closed meetings in the future, except for military secrets, to all senators. A proposal was made to allow public hearings when the committee discusses the government's national defense plan. This proposal has been rejected by the committee. This decision by the committee was caused by a dispute arising from President Roosevelt's report to the committee last week.

[Associated Press, Washington, 11th] The Senate Military Committee has decided that all secret meetings in the future, except for military secrets, will be made public. However, after intense debate on the President's national defense plan, especially the US sale of fighter jets to France, it was still passed that it could not be made public.

[Central News Agency, East Hartford, Connecticut, USA, 10th] The United Aircraft Corporation said that the British government has purchased 200 aircraft engines and fixed-speed propellers from the company. Since Britain recently purchased 200 airframes from the North American Aviation Corporation, they are now purchasing 200 engines.

[Reuters, Rome, 10th] The Italian Fascist Supreme Council met this evening and adjourned after observing a moment of silence for the death of the Pope.

[Reuters, Washington, 10th] President Roosevelt's message of condolence to Cardinal Basilio Pompili was sent by Secretary of State Hull today, stating, "The Pope's great personality, his passion for peace, and his generosity and magnanimity have been deeply appreciated by people of all nations and faiths."

### American Ambassador to Britain Joseph P. Kennedy Returns to Post. Denies Predicting War.

[Reuters, New York, 10th] American Ambassador to Britain Joseph P. Kennedy, before returning to his post on the "Queen Mary," declared that he had spoken with President Roosevelt for two hours. He denied the rumor that on the 10th of last month, he and Ambassador to France William Christian Bullitt attended a meeting of the Congressional Military Committee and predicted that war would break out this spring. He said, "I have never predicted war. When I returned from Europe last time, I reported to you that I do not predict the stock market or diplomatic events. I am not a prophet, so I would not predict war." When asked if his return to Britain this time was related to the situation in Spain, he replied, "I am only returning to my post."

### Britain's Naval and Air Forces are Sufficient to Deal with Invasion. Home Secretary Hoare Delivers a Speech. Chamberlain's Declaration is a Roar.

[Reuters, London, 10th] British Home Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare (see photo) delivered a speech in Plymouth today, saying that "The British government does not want to adopt policies towards its colonies that are of no benefit to anyone." He said that he had clearly explained the issue of world raw material supply at the Geneva conference, and that explanation can still represent the government's views. If the issue of raw material supply is indeed sufficient to cause future disputes, he really does not understand why this issue and all commercial issues cannot be resolved through negotiations and discussions. Speaking of Prime Minister Chamberlain's guarantee to France, Hoare said, "This remark is by no means as weak and powerless as the opponents say, but is actually the roar of those who are determined to maintain world peace. Its purpose is not only to maintain the broad interests of the British Empire, but also to maintain the interests of countries that are closely related to Britain." Based on the experience of the Great War and the great progress made after the war, he believes that Britain will no longer be in danger of being threatened by submarines as it was during the Great War. He said that since the crisis in September last year, British aircraft manufacturing has made great strides. To this day, the British Air Force is sufficient to deal with any aggressor. He concluded, "We dare to say that our country is now safer than before. We believe that there is no reason to be pessimistic about the current situation of national defense and the international situation."

### Another Large Batch of European Gold Shipped to America.

[Central News Agency, New York, 10th] Recently, another large batch of gold from Europe has arrived in the United States. The last batch, about $60,000,000, has been deposited in the Federal Reserve Bank. The bank's foreign gold reserves are now over $600,000,000. Most of it came from Britain. Although the reason given on the surface is to stabilize the exchange rate, such a large amount is not really necessary. Its intention is obviously somewhere else. According to Wall Street financial circles, it is speculated that European countries may want to deposit gold in the United States as a reserve fund, so that in the event of war, they can purchase supplies and various raw materials in accordance with the principle of cash purchase and self-responsibility for transportation. The danger of transporting gold at that time will thus be avoided.

### (Continued from page 3) "The New World War"

(9) The Main Line of Defense

I continue to say: "Paying attention to Japan's invasion of China, I hope that the psychology and conscience of Western people will have a more accurate understanding of the actual importance of the Far East dispute, not to regard it as a local struggle, but to recognize it as an important part of the new world war, and to recognize it as the main line of defense of this war. This new world war is the war launched by Germany, Italy, and Japan to create their new empires by force."

Having described all the facts of the international situation as above, my personal opinion is that this new world war is still in a brewing state. In Europe, actual warfare has not yet openly broken out. Therefore, my suggestion is: if we want to prevent this war from brewing into an actual open outbreak, we must immediately, before the totalitarian powers' offensive begins, cause their line of defense in the Far East to collapse and disintegrate.

I believe that an unconquered China is a factor for peace in Europe. What China lacks now is armaments, but these armaments can be supplied by Western countries. The Chinese people have a firm will to resist, not just millions, but hundreds of millions. If Western countries provide China with modern armaments, the war consumed here will inevitably exhaust Japan and eventually cause it to collapse. A weakened or defeated Japan will not become a worrying war element for the Soviet Union's eastern defense line, and the Soviet Union will not have to worry about both east and west. With no need to worry about both east and west, plus the United States' endless fighting power to assist Britain and France, it can make Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy understand that war is still a delusion that cannot achieve its goals.

(10) Westernism

But opponents believe that the real problems in Europe do not allow Britain and France to take action in China or the Far East. This view is a recurrence of a strategic concept from the European War. This concept prolonged the period of the last World War, and if it were not for American intervention, Germany under the rule of the House of Hohenzollern would not have failed."

During the last World War, the French called this concept "Westernism." I believe that if it is not an absolute defense theory, this theory firmly advocates focusing on the Western front. At that time, most of the Allied military experts and realistic politicians advocated this strategy and opposed the theory of focusing on the Eastern front. According to the theory of those who advocated focusing on the Eastern front, since the enemy's main force was in the West, it was certain that the Western battle had to be won, but from the perspective of common sense and sound strategy, one should take advantage of the enemy's weaknesses and attack their East to achieve victory in the early stages of the war. This theory was later faithfully proven to be correct. The reason why General Foch was able to overcome the enemy on the Western front was undoubtedly due to the collapse of Turkish and Bulgarian military forces, which greatly affected and led to the failure of the German military forces in the East.

(11) Four-Power Intervention

If Britain and France were to intervene in the line of defense in China against the aggressor nations, they could not only protect the interests of their empires but also quickly fulfill their treaty obligations to China. The strength of the aggressor nations on the Chinese line of defense is actually less than their strength on the European line of defense. Therefore, if Russia participates in joint intervention, the safety of Britain and France in Europe will not be in any danger during any intervention period. Moreover, if the actions of Britain, the United States, France, and Russia take the form of Western intervention, it is also very possible. The so-called four-power intervention is to make tiered demands on Japan, demanding that it stop the slaughter in China and demanding that it participate in the Washington International Conference to resolve the Far East issues.

Japan may refuse these demands, but it is not certain. Japanese leaders have historically yielded to strength three times. The first time, American naval commander Matthew Perry forced feudal Japan to open the country and trade with various countries. The second time, before the European War, Japan was intervened in by Russia, Germany, and France and yielded, returning the Liaodong Peninsula to China. The third time, at the Washington Conference after the European War, Japan was forced by pressure from all sides to give up Shandong. Now the safety of all countries depends on the maintenance of the existing international system and the balance of power in the world. Therefore, if Chinese politicians can assist the great powers in creating a common action of the four powers, it is very possible that Japan will yield to strength for the fourth time.

### Four-Nation Anti-Communist Pact to Transform into Military Alliance: Japan Dispatches Three Commissioners to Berlin Conference to Clarify Opinions

[Reuters, London, 11th] Canning, in an article in the "News Chronicle," stated that the Japan-Germany-Italy-Hungary Anti-Comintern Pact is planning to transform into a military alliance. Japan has already dispatched three commissioners on the "Conte Verde" (which passed through Hong Kong last week) to Germany to clarify official instructions at the Berlin conference at the end of this month. The purpose is to transform the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance. All Japanese ambassadors to Europe will also attend at that time. It is said that the reason for the delay in transforming the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance is that Japan wants to target the Soviet Union, while Germany and Italy strongly advocate that Britain, France, and the United States should also be included as targets. The newspaper also stated that at a meeting of Japanese ambassadors to Europe in Paris last month, it was decided to ask the Japanese government to accept the opinions of Germany and Italy, hence the upcoming Berlin conference.

[Reuters, London, 10th] Today, Jewish representatives and British representatives attended the Palestine Conference. Colonial Secretary MacDonald reviewed the proposals of the Jewish Congress. It is understood that the Jewish delegation has agreed to provide a considered response to several points raised on Sunday. The Arabs issued a declaration stating that the Arab proposal aims to enable Arabs to enjoy their natural rights in a peaceful country, and to safeguard national independence and guarantee freedom and security, in accordance with traditional ideals. The Arab proposal does not express resentment towards the people of Britain or other countries. "The Arabs have been deprived of the independence promised by the British government in October 1915. The Arabs will never recognize the Balfour Declaration or the Mandate. The issue of Jewish refugees' settlement concerns the entire civilized world. The solution to this problem must be sought elsewhere, not in Palestine. The Arabs demand (1) complete independence; (2) abandonment of the attempt to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine; (3) abolition of the Mandate and its replacement with a treaty, making Palestine an independent Arab state; (4) an immediate halt to Jewish immigration to Palestine; (5) a ban on land sales to Jews." It is claimed that the current policy in Palestine is extremely unfair to the Arab people. Palestine cannot achieve peace until the principles of morality and equality are accepted to achieve true fairness.

### Spaak's Resignation; Not Yet Accepted by Belgian King

[Haitong News Agency, Beijing, 11th] Belgian King Leopold met with former Prime Minister Spaak yesterday afternoon for more than an hour. Prior to that, he had met with the presidents of the parliament and senate, as well as several other key government officials. According to political sources, the Belgian King greatly desires that Spaak's cabinet continue to exist, as the cabinet's resignation has not yet been formally accepted. Furthermore, according to a statement issued by Parliament President Hesman after leaving the palace, the Belgian King refused to accept the proposal for a coalition cabinet of Catholics and Socialists, and refused to dissolve parliament. Furthermore, local newspapers commented that due to racial and cultural conflicts between Walloons and Flemish, it may be difficult to completely resolve the current political situation.

### Spanish Rebel Government Plans to Join Anti-Comintern Pact

[Central News Agency, London, 10th] Colonel Luis, commander of the Nationalist forces on the Spanish island of Mallorca in the Mediterranean, was discussing the peaceful acceptance of Menorca with representatives of the Menorca government on the British cruiser HMS "Devonshire" (which was anchored in Mahon harbor on Menorca) yesterday when several aircraft suddenly flew from Mallorca and bombed Menorca. Members of the British Parliament have commented that, due to the resentment of the Nationalist authorities over the expressions issued by the Republican side to General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, the Duke of Alba, the unofficial representative of the Nationalist government in the UK, has been instructed to provide assurances to the British government that the Nationalist government may join the Anti-Comintern Pact, which is a matter of considerable concern. Britain is said to have discussed this with the Nationalist authorities.

### What If Franco Wins?!

— Translated by Shichang

Abridged translation of Paul Mc Gufre's original article from the February issue of Parade magazine this year.

The Spanish war has progressed to its final stages. People who are concerned about the Spanish war have clearly shifted their attention from the military aspect to a more important aspect—establishing a new Spain. Even those who strongly support Franco express anxiety about this issue: what kind of political system will the new Spain adopt? Will it adopt a fascist political system like Italy, or a Nazi political system like Germany? Will it be ruled by Italians or Germans? This is an important question after the Spanish war. Many people will raise this question. When I went to Spain, I also thought about these questions. According to what I can deduce, the answer is as follows:

I do not believe that Germany and Italy can rule Spain in the short term. Italy's purpose in participating in the Spanish war was to stop the development of communism in Spain. Of course, the defeat of the Spanish government forces gave Italy's policy an important victory. Germany's participation in the Spanish war helped Franco gain great benefits in terms of commodity production and transportation in Spain, but we still cannot see that Italy or Germany can rule Spain. They may be able to obtain certain privileges, such as developing mining, etc., but the power of other foreign capital in Spain is very significant and influential (such as Britain's power in Rio Tinto and Vizcaya). Whether Spain welcomes the expansion of foreign investment is also very questionable, and Franco, at the beginning of the war, even when he was most hopeless, firmly declared that he would protect the integrity of Spanish territory and not allow any other country to occupy an inch of Spanish land. The Spanish people are trying their best to support this statement. I believe that Spanish nationalism will definitely flourish. This phenomenon may have advantages and disadvantages. The new Spain is not the Spain we have been familiar with in recent centuries. This new Spain has a very active military and cultural evolution.

The strangest phenomenon I got from Spain is that people all over Spain, especially general political affairs personnel, pay very close attention to the issue of rebuilding Spain, and are more concerned about it than the war that is still going on. Spaniards have a special talent for handling their own affairs. War is a matter for soldiers, and the difficult work of political officials is to establish a new order. There is a close relationship between the strategy of soldiers and the governance of political officials.

When we think of the new Spain in the future and its political system, we must remember that the Spanish people are very eager for personal freedom. A political system that despises freedom can never appear in Spain, so Spain must absolutely not be fascistized or Nazified. In the process of restoring Spain, various failures are inevitable, but the spirit of those engaged in this restoration work is firm and pure. Therefore, it can be asserted that the new order in Spain will adopt a political system like Portugal, rather than like Italy or Germany. The Spanish people know that this new order must develop from the lower classes to the upper classes. Society is gradually progressing, and it cannot be manufactured all at once. Although the government must guide or supervise certain situations, it must encourage people to automatically develop their economic organizations. Spain's political institutions will gradually grow up like Portugal.

Franco is very clearly aware that he cannot create a political system and force the Spanish people to accept it. He must gradually cultivate the development of a certain political system, so that the people automatically tend to a kind of political system, such as paying attention to his family morality and social importance, and working hard to establish various situations, so that every family knows this importance. The new Spain will value the interests of civilians and promote the average distribution of property. Portugal is now rapidly moving towards becoming a country with an average distribution of wealth, and Spain will also move in this direction. Spain must continue to implement the wage system, and has accepted the principle of the family wage system. Efforts will also be made to improve undertakings with low wages, especially regarding home industries and clothing undertakings that employ female workers. Spain has now stipulated the minimum wage for home industries, and has also improved working conditions. The wages of car drivers have increased by 50%, and public health undertakings are also progressing rapidly. There are tuberculosis sanatoriums in all provinces of Spain, which are sufficient to accommodate tuberculosis patients across the country. In addition, there are children's hospitals to promote children's health.

Is the new Spain growing?

### Brief Comment: Japanese Envoy to Europe

[London, 11th Dispatch from the News Chronicle] "Three Japanese envoys have gone to Europe, and their task is to convey Japan's views on the meeting to be convened in Berlin at the end of this month." The "Berlin meeting" referred to here is a meeting where the three aggressive countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan will discuss how to make further developments in the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. From the Munich Conference to the fall of Catalonia, the European situation has undergone new changes. How will fascist aggressors enhance mutual contact in the future? How will they carry out the re-division of colonies under a unified strategy? And how to change the tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact into a tripartite military alliance? All these will be important topics of this meeting.

The foreign policy of × and ×× compromise has not only sacrificed Abyssinia, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, and is not only sacrificing Spain and some intermediate countries in Europe, but will also lead to adventurous actions by fascist aggressors directly demanding colonies from countries such as Britain and France. German and Italian aggressors are indeed attempting to use this Berlin meeting to achieve a dominant position in Europe, and Japan is even conspiring to intensify its collusion with German and Italian aggressors? Safely implement its "Japan-Manchukuo-China Group" and "East Asia New Order". Germany's Three B policy is being repeated in the old way, and is being promoted step by step. Italy's plan to dominate the Mediterranean and Africa has also begun its most intensive actions? And Japanese aggressors have even taken the military step of forcibly occupying Hainan Island due to the serious situation!

The situation of war on two fronts is becoming increasingly clear. All those who do not want to be slaves of fascist aggressors, all those who love peace and protect freedom and justice, should quickly stand on the side of the peace front and quickly use their strength to break the international ×× bandits ×' meeting and its plans!

### Japanese × Attack Hainan Island

The serious significance of the Japanese × attack on Hainan Island, especially the serious significance of the Japanese × beginning direct military action to threaten the Far East ××× countries, has been pointed out in detail in yesterday's editorial of this newspaper. According to dispatches from various parties, the authorities of France, Britain, and the United States have paid close attention to it and are discussing taking clear actions to deal with it. Although it is not yet possible to predict how the situation will develop, the following points should be noted by us:

First, the Japanese × attack on Hainan Island has two main intentions: internally, it is to cooperate with the anti-Soviet provocation incidents on the border of the puppet Manchukuo, creating a serious situation, in order to curb the mutiny of the Japanese army in the front and the anti-war sentiment of all sectors in the rear, in order to facilitate the parliament to pass the huge military budget of 730 million yen for the next year; externally, it is to cooperate with the adventures of German and Italian aggressors in Europe and launch a preliminary battle to exclude the powers in the Far East.

Second, the Japanese × action of attacking Hainan Island has inherent factors for inevitable failure due to its own lack of strength. Therefore, this action not only cannot be said that the × army's momentum is still great, but on the contrary, it exposes the × army's ×××× speculative adventure. This kind of Japanese action can be resisted and can be stopped.

Third, the important impact that the Japanese × action of attacking Hainan Island can have on the future of our country's war of resistance is to expand the battlefield, disperse the × army's strength, and increase our foreign aid and the × army's external pressure. Not only will our southwest war resistance situation not deteriorate, but it will develop more smoothly.

Fourth, we should not relax every opportunity to increase the × people's difficulties and develop the victory of our army based on these characteristics listed above. Our opinion circles should explain these characteristics to the people of the country on the one hand, break the peace and surrender propositions of × people, traitors, and pro-Japanese elements who are defeatists, and on the other hand, awaken the peace and democratic countries, pay attention to the serious threat of the Japanese × attack on Hainan Island to the Far East interests of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, quickly jointly and effectively promote the steps of aiding China and curbing Japan, and smash any absurd propositions of international conferences to mediate the "Sino-Japanese conflict". This is one point. Secondly, we should take emergency steps in military terms. On the one hand, we should massively supply the heroic resistance troops and guerrillas on the island with military fire, grain, and other supplies in order to persistently contain a large number of × troops in a corner of Hainan; on the other hand, we should step up the counter-offensive actions of our army in Guangdong Province, especially breaking the attack pride on the Yuehan Road and Xijiang. This is two.

### After × Lands on Hainan, Hong Kong's Economy and Food Are Affected; Huge Commercial Exchanges Between the Two Places Will Suffer Losses; Meat Supply Interrupted, Risk of Market Shortages in the Future

In order to implement its southward policy, × does not hesitate to violate the Franco-Japanese agreement and attack Hainan Island. When the telegrams came, people here attached great importance to it. The economic relationship between Hainan and Hong Kong is extremely close, and the number of commercial exchanges is quite large. Among them, the largest are livestock such as pigs and cattle, sugar, vegetables, and fresh fruits. Nineteen out of ten pigs and cattle in Hong Kong's daily meat supply come from Hainan. Now that the war has broken out, the source will inevitably be interrupted, and it will not be difficult for Hong Kong's meat supply to be in short supply. In the past, livestock such as pigs and cattle were transported from Taiwan, our Guangdong inland, and Wuzhou in Guangxi. Since the war began last year, merchants have automatically refused to source from Taiwan, and now transportation to the mainland Wuzhou is also congested. With the source from Hainan cut off, the future supply will be a serious problem. As for a large number of local Hainan products, which are transported and sold by various offices, they will also be lost after this. Moreover, a not small number of European and American goods are transported from Hong Kong to Hainan for sale every year. Therefore, this time the × army attacked Qiong, which invisibly caused major blows to Hong Kong's commerce and food. It is inevitable that European and American merchants in Hong Kong who have invested in Hainan in the past will suffer losses. It goes without saying that Hong Kong's commerce and food have suffered major blows from this action by the × army.

Hong Kong-Qiong Ships Still Set Sail Yesterday

Moreover, it is even more important in the shipping industry. It is found that the Qiongzhou Strait is a necessary stop on the shipping routes from South China to various ports in Southeast Asia, and it is the main route of Taikoo Jardine and other shipping companies, which is no different from the lifeblood of their business. If the scope of the war expands, it will not be difficult for × to blockade the strait, and various Yihs will inevitably be forced to suspend navigation. Yesterday, Taikoo company officials claimed that the company's ships had no intention of suspending navigation, unless it was until the Japanese side prevented navigation before a decision was made. Jardine Matheson and other companies also adopted the same attitude. Yisheng of Yi Si and Jiangsu of Taikoo both set sail from Hong Kong to Haikou yesterday afternoon, and Meinan is scheduled to set sail this morning. However, each ship temporarily suspended the delivery of goods, and various banks, trading houses, and merchants did not dare to deliver goods due to the unclear situation. There were also few passengers. It was also found that Yongsheng, Xinjiang, Meizhongmei and other ships arrived in Hong Kong from Haikou at 10:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. yesterday, respectively. All ships left Haikou for Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 9th. At that time, everything was as usual. However, when the ship Meizhongmei set sail, it encountered a Japanese warship outside the port. After the ship's crew answered each question in flag language to the crew members of the warship, it was allowed to leave.

Hong Kong-Based Qiong Overseas Chinese Initiate to Save Hometown

Also, since the news of the landing of × troops in Qiong spread to Hong Kong, the Qiongya fellow villagers living in Hong Kong have paid abnormal attention. At the same time, because the telegram exchanges are intermittent, the situation is very unclear, and everyone is anxious. Moreover, the outbreak of the war, the hometown is in trouble, and it is inevitable that they will be displaced, hungry, and cold. Relief and rescue are urgent. Therefore, yesterday, the Qiongya Fellow Villagers Association in Hong Kong held an urgent special meeting to decide on the various relief work to be carried out in the hometown. Now, they are determined to actively mobilize and appeal to various overseas Chinese groups and charitable organizations to assist in everything, so that all future relief work in the hometown can be carried out effectively.

### Imperial Airways General Manager in Hong Kong Returns to Hong Kong to Discuss Planning Hong Kong-Yunnan-Burma Line Stations; Mission Completed Yesterday, Returned to Hong Kong by Plane from Hanoi; Denies Going to Chongqing to Attend Opening Conference of Burma-Chongqing Flight

Our authorities signed an agreement with the British some time ago to open up the Rangoon-Kunming-Hong Kong line to facilitate contact. At the same time, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) is developing a new Chongqing-Burma line and dispatching giant aircraft to travel on it. Therefore, after the completion of the Hong Kong-Rangoon line, it will have close contact with the Chongqing-Burma line. Regarding the facts of the opening of the above two lines, Chongqing held a meeting on the 6th of this month. Mr. Meiri, the general manager of Imperial Airways in Hong Kong, left Hong Kong and flew to Penang before the meeting. It was rumored that Mr. Mei's trip was to attend the meeting in Chongqing. Mr. Mei returned to Hong Kong from Hanoi yesterday on a Danapo Bana Imperial Airways aircraft. The reporter asked about the course of this trip and denied going to Chongqing.

Meiri's Speech Denies Going to Chongqing

According to Mr. Meiri, he took a car from Kunming to Hanoi and then took a plane back to Hong Kong. It is not true that I went to Chongqing a few days ago to attend the joint flight meeting between China National Aviation Corporation and Imperial Airways. My destination this time was Kunming, not Chongqing. I did not know that there was such a meeting in Chongqing. I left Hong Kong for Hanoi on the 31st of last month and took the road to Yunnan. I stayed in Kunming for eight days. The task I was assigned was to plan the Kunming airport on the Hong Kong-Yunnan-Burma line in preparation for the future opening of flights. In addition, I did not participate in any group meetings. All matters regarding the opening of the Hong Kong-Yunnan-Rangoon line have long been discussed and completed by China and Britain. Now all preparations have been completed and flights will be opened in the short term. My inspection work in Yunnan has been completed and I am returning to Hong Kong specifically. I will send the information I have obtained to the head office for review on the Tuesday flight. Once I receive a reply by telegram, the airport work can begin immediately. The type of aircraft to be dispatched in the future and the date of the opening of flights will also have to wait for the approval of the head office. It has not yet been decided at present.

Flying Hotel Passengers Expected Soon

The Pan American giant Boeing aircraft on the Hong Kong-US line is scheduled to fly from San Francisco to Hong Kong on the 22nd of this month and arrive on the 1st of next month as scheduled. This flight is for test flight purposes and will not carry passengers on either of the round trips. After this test flight is completed, official flights will be opened to passengers on March 22nd. The Pan American authorities are now making some changes to the original flying scissor schedule in preparation for the opening of the aircraft. The revised time has been announced as follows:

The China Clipper will arrive in Hong Kong from the US on February 13 and return to the US from Hong Kong on February 14. The Philippine Clipper will arrive in Hong Kong on February 22 and return to the US on February 23. The Boeing (NX18760) will arrive in Hong Kong on March 1 and return to the US on March 2. The China Clipper will arrive in Hong Kong on March 8 and return to the US on March 9. The Philippine Clipper will arrive in Hong Kong on March 15 and return to the US on March 16. The Boeing (NX186701) will arrive in Hong Kong on March 22 and return to the US on March 23.

### Amateur Association Advocates: Year-End Economy and Donation Movement; Eliminate Wasteful Habits, Donate to Save the Nation; Donations to Be Submitted to This Newspaper for Remittance to the Government

The "Amateur Association" is one of the organizations in Hong Kong that vigorously promotes economy. Under the banner of fellowship, it advocates a reasonable lifestyle for the people of Hong Kong. It aims to replace extravagant pleasures with collective and wholesome entertainment. It is also enthusiastic about the war effort, encouraging various donation movements. With the Lunar New Year approaching, the people of Hong Kong may be preparing for festivities. However, happiness comes with conditions! The "Amateur Association" continues the spirit of the "One Dollar Movement" and "Charity Sales," proposing a "Year-End Donation Movement." Excerpts from their proposal regarding this movement are as follows:

"The Lunar New Year is approaching, and our compatriots will traditionally celebrate joyfully—but…we are currently fighting desperately against the enemy. This is not a time for individual pleasure-seeking…

"Holding firm to our belief in victory, we are delighted that our nation has embarked on a path of self-reliance during the war of resistance, advancing forward. We want to celebrate the future of China, so we cry out loudly! This twenty-eighth Lunar New Year [1939], we should donate all the money previously spent on banquets, gambling, gift-giving, firecrackers, and worshipping idols to the government to buy airplanes, guns, cannons, and bombs to fight the enemy. This would be a meaningful and easily achievable action. We now call it 'Year-End Donation'…

"We have now contacted the Hong Kong 'Shen Bao' and 'Ta Kung Pao' newspapers to collect these donations on our behalf. Once a sufficient amount is accumulated, it will be remitted to the government. We hope that everyone will send their saved money to the aforementioned newspapers!…"

Their enthusiastic actions to save the nation will surely receive the fervent support of the overseas Chinese. Compatriots! Let us enthusiastically contribute money and respond to this movement!

### St. John's Ambulance Brigade Survey Results: Number of Homeless Refugees Reaches 20,000; Hong Kong Government Still Lacks Comprehensive Relief Measures

Since the enemy's invasion of South China, a large number of war refugees have flooded into Hong Kong. People from all walks of life in Hong Kong have been busy with relief efforts, neglecting the original refugees in Hong Kong. The only remaining relief organization is the Street Sleepers Relief Society, which continues to operate refugee camps. However, although the various camps are open as much as possible, many refugees are still sleeping on the streets, huddled together with their children, presenting a pathetic sight. A month ago, the Hong Kong government, in order to provide relief, entrusted the St. John Ambulance Brigade to conduct a detailed survey in the Hong Kong and areas to prepare for the implementation of relief measures. The survey work has also been completed. Yesterday, the reporter visited Mr. Morris, the Superintendent-in-Chief of the Brigade, to inquire about the survey process and the progress of relief measures. He stated that the authorities believe that these refugees are forced to sleep on the streets and become displaced due to the difficulties in their lives and the lack of sufficient income to cover their food and housing needs. The authorities have a responsibility to provide such relief. A month ago, the responsibility for the survey was entrusted to the Brigade, with each division dispatched to conduct surveys in various districts at night. The survey was completed last month, and a survey report was prepared and submitted to the Hong Kong government for reference. However, according to a report published a few days ago, the total number of refugees in Hong Kong is 50,000, which may not be entirely accurate. According to reports received from various divisions, the total number is approximately 20,000. As for what measures the authorities will take to provide relief, there is still no overall plan. However, it is expected that these refugees will be moved to the refugee camp in North Point (Seven Sisters). The relocation will be carried out step by step, without coercion. Those who are willing to enter the camp will be sent there by the government.

Interview

### Progress of the Era Drama Troupe

— Jun

Organization, Art, and Spirit Have All Improved

After several months of separation, the "Era Drama Troupe" once again held its seventh expanded public performance at the Po Hing Theatre yesterday. Attending this performance felt like meeting old friends, filling me with warmth. Although I am not very familiar with the "Era Drama Troupe" of the past, I have witnessed its growth firsthand. I have seen how this "Flower of the Era" sprouted from a seed, how it budded, and how it bloomed. Furthermore, I have expressed earnest wishes for it to bear beautiful fruit. This is the "Era Drama Troupe's" seventh public performance. With the exception of the sixth performance in Macau, I have attended the previous five performances. Each performance showed improvement. This premiere performance of "Wilderness" in Hong Kong especially revealed the bright future of the "Era Drama Troupe's" rebirth.

To learn more details about the "Era Drama Troupe," I visited Li Chenfeng backstage at the Po Hing Theatre on the night of the "Wilderness" performance. The first act was already underway. In the backstage area, apart from the sound of actors reciting their lines from the front of the stage, everyone working backstage was moving quickly and silently. Upon seeing Mr. Li Chenfeng, I almost didn't recognize him in his gauze clothing and with an earring. He was playing the role of Jiao Daxing in "Wilderness." Afraid of disturbing the front of the stage, I whispered to him, and he could only briefly share the troupe's future plans. He said:

"Many friends who love theater art know the struggles of the Era Drama Troupe in the past, because running a professional troupe in Hong Kong is simply an adventurous undertaking. In the past, we held regular performances at the Central Theatre, but each time we suffered losses. Coping with these setbacks was the most difficult task. Many troupe members endured hardships. The only consolation was the praise and encouragement from the public, which boosted our morale. Despite the difficulties, we never dared to lose heart. This rebirth of the Era Drama Troupe can be said to have reached a second stage, bringing us closer to our goal.

"The Era Drama Troupe has greatly expanded its organization for this performance. Many new members have joined, most of whom are well-known in mainland China and came to Hong Kong after the war. There are also three students from the Drama Research Institute who are well-versed in theater art. Therefore, the current lineup of the Era Drama Troupe is stronger than before. We are also very grateful for Mr. Wu Chu-fan's guest appearance. One thing worth noting is that Mr. Ouyang Yuqian spent several months guiding us in rehearsing plays such as 'The New Official Takes Office,' which greatly enhanced our artistic skills.

"The Era Drama Troupe's plans for the future differ somewhat from the past. In terms of performances, we have decided to hold regular performances in Hong Kong and Macau, aiming for six or seven performances each month: two days in Hong Kong and two days in Kowloon. Previously, each performance was only staged once, and the timing was in the morning, which was not convenient for the general public. Now, we have changed to performing both matinee and evening shows, giving everyone the opportunity to attend. However, finding a performance venue at the end of the year is not easy, so whether our planned schedule will be realized is still uncertain, but we hope that we can achieve our goal. Performing in Macau is no longer a problem; the most difficult task is still finding a suitable theater in Hong Kong.

"The selection of plays is also the most important issue. Apart from plays that require special sets or too many characters, which are beyond our capabilities, we plan to perform two main types of plays: one that benefits China's resistance against the enemy, and one that is closer to our daily lives. At the same time, we will also pay attention to rehearsing new plays that have never been performed in Hong Kong. The 'Wilderness' that we are performing this time is a premiere in Hong Kong. The Cantonese performances of 'Sunrise' and 'The New Official Takes Office' can also be considered pioneering. The rehearsal time was too short, so perhaps there are imperfections, but we are determined to encourage ourselves and work harder to establish a solid foundation for the development of spoken drama in Hong Kong."

At this point, it was time for "Jiao Daxing" to go on stage. Li Chenfeng could not continue talking. He asked me to visit the troupe another day to chat and hurried onto the stage. After the interview, I took my seat to watch the "Wilderness."

Cao Yu's "Wilderness" is as brilliant as "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise." Although the story focuses on "Chou Hu's" revenge, the depiction of different human natures is also quite powerful. The main part is in the third act, and the best performance is also in the third act.

Old members such as Lu Dun, Ou Ai, Li Chenfeng, and Wu Si have all improved, especially Li Chenfeng and Lu Dun, who can be said to have achieved complete success. Li Yueqing, who played "Jiao Da's Mother," had very skilled acting and lines, which was refreshing and delightful. The climax of the play was when Chou Hu shouted, "Dark world—we are simply in hell!" This is the most brilliant line.

### The Market for Children's Toys

— Jun Ren

Domestic Toys Rise in Popularity

I remember when I was a child, I would be delighted and excited every time the Lunar New Year approached. There was good food, red envelopes, and especially toys given by my parents and relatives. Before the New Year, I would already stare blankly at the New Year's stalls on the streets and alleys. They were filled with toys, red and green, bizarre and colorful, whistling, blowing, and jumping—everything imaginable. You can imagine how tempting and attractive this was to children. After all, parents see through this psychology of children, so at this time they have to make an exception and buy some to win their children's hearts.

These children's toys seem not worth caring about. Many people believe that toys are not serious or valuable things, so they are unimportant. In fact, if we examine them carefully, they are a very important matter, because toys have a great influence on children's education. Good toys are equivalent to good children's education. Therefore, in foreign countries, experts study children's toys and make great efforts to improve them. In contrast, the Chinese have exactly the opposite attitude. They mostly ignore the relationship between toys and education, and they believe that toys are just small items, and the amount of money required for everyone to buy them is small. However, they do not know that small amounts add up to large amounts. The amount of money China spends on toys each year is surprisingly large. It can be seen that although toys are small items, they are directly related to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

Because the Chinese do not pay attention to toys, the narrow-minded Japanese have also coveted this path. They make small things into toys and sell them to China in large quantities. As a result, these small toys have become one of their major exports. Not only in China, but also in the markets of various countries around the world are filled with products. In the past, we saw Japanese tin toys sold in the markets at the end of the year and the beginning of the year. The stalls were full of them, and they even penetrated into rural areas. Almost all of China was filled with these oriental toys. In just one New Year, some of the toys consumed in the hands of children had already exchanged a lot of gold earned by the sweat of the Chinese people. Thinking of this makes people shudder.

One New Year after another has passed, and at the same time, funds have been flowing out of the country. Later, partly because the Chinese people had some awareness, and partly because of , they gradually began to pay attention to the manufacture of toys. Domestic toys have indeed made great progress in recent years. Up to now, although it cannot completely recover this loss, it has also been of great benefit.

However, because China's industry is underdeveloped, the manufacture of toys is still mostly handicraft production. Wooden ones, such as swords and spears, are painted with silver paint and decorated with red cloth. This is the most common toy, so even now, people still have a mentality. This is probably because of the influence of this type of toy. There are also figures carved from Yangmei wood, such as woodcutters, fishermen, and weavers. The workmanship is very fine, and the carving is beautiful. Not only can they be used as toys, but they can also be called works of art. Foreigners like these wood carvings very much, and many of them are bought. At the Jinmen World Expo, hundreds of kinds of wood carvings were transported for exhibition. The best at carving these figures are mostly from Fuzhou, but unfortunately, many of them produce various bad things, such as gambling and smoking, which have a negative impact on international audiences. There are also many paper toys, mainly windmills, masks, paper mice, and paper snakes. In addition to clay figures, clay ones include birds, fruits, and exquisite lucky items, but the fruit handles and chicken feet are made of iron wire, which is not convenient for children to play with. The work of ceramic and porcelain ones is very exquisite, but unfortunately they are easily broken, so sales are not widespread. Various animals made of sealing wax can float on water, but they are rarely seen now. These are all the inherent toys of China in the past. Few of them are currently popular. There are only some wooden and bamboo ones, such as bamboo machine guns and wooden geese and ducks, which are the only ones left.

Initially, none of the roads and toys were goods, but China only set up factories to produce them itself last year. The results are not bad, and the workmanship of the Great Ocean dolls is far superior to the goods. Unfortunately, there are too few products. Initially, the iron-printed toys were also completely goods. Currently, the domestically produced iron-printed toys are quite developed, and all the characters are modeled after Chinese people, so they are very popular and have replaced some goods. A new type of toy is a small tin army, which is made by model casting. There are various soldiers in various poses, artillery, broadsword teams, and tanks, all of which are available. One group is the Chinese army, and the other group is the army. When lined up, they look like they are fighting against each other. Because we are currently in the period of resistance against the enemy, this is considered the most timely toy, and sales are very good. There are even more orders from overseas Chinese, so on average, tens of thousands of dollars are transported from Hong Kong to other places every month. Imagine how amazing the number is! There are several companies in Hong Kong that manufacture these toys, and they can all make a profit. But unfortunately, some of the models are purchased from foreign countries, so the uniforms of the troops are not very similar to those of Chinese soldiers. These two points must be improved.

I once asked a toy vendor about the market for toys this year. According to him, this year, because the American film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" caused a sensation, all eight protagonists in the film were made into toys. Merchants are always good at seizing opportunities, so in addition to making plastic and road characters, they also use these characters as trademark patterns, such as on face powder, handkerchiefs, ties, bed sheets, New Year cards, and cigarettes. At the same time, this type of toy is also very popular. Snow White and the seven dwarfs are all lively and lovely, just like in the movie, and they are very popular with children. The toy market this year is particularly good, probably because of the increase in the population of Hong Kong. However, one phenomenon is very optimistic, that is, there are far fewer goods than in the past. During the New Year, every child is happiest when they have toys in their hands. If this toy can increase the country's resources and develop the country's industry, I believe they will be even happier.

### The Silver Conspiracy

— Pan Lang

Japanese fascists are invading China. In addition to military, political, and economic aggression, they are also spending huge amounts of money to carry out cultural aggression. The conspiracy against the film and theater industry was only brought to the attention of the Lei film and theater industry after the "Camellia" incident of the Shanghai Guangming Company's voyage to Japan not long ago. Since then, the conspiracies of Japanese fascists and their agents in China against the film and theater industry have been constantly exposed.

In terms of film alone, as the War of Resistance shifted from the first stage to the second, Japanese aggressors were eager to maintain and strengthen their control over the occupied areas, and their conspiracies became even more heated and intense. The purpose and content of their film conspiracy is to use film works to: on the one hand, numb the national self-esteem and self-confidence of our people in the occupied areas with pornography; on the other hand, guide our people's anti-Japanese and revengeful emotions in the occupied areas to the path of defeatism and fatalism; on the other hand, promote hypocritical and vicious appeasement policies, so that the people in the occupied areas not only willingly submit to Japanese rule, but also facilitate the exploitation of their blood and sweat by the puppet rulers to continue their invasion and achieve the conquest of China and the hegemony of the Far East.

Based on this conspiracy, Japanese fascists have determined the film's mainland policy. The specific guidelines and methods of this policy are, of course, absolutely secret, but according to a part of the plan that has been exposed, it can be divided into two points: first, to implement the "promotion" of Sino-Japanese culture on the screen, with the cultural departments of the Japanese military controlling the film industry in the Japanese-occupied areas and helping the political departments of the Japanese army to carry out the work of conquest; second, to use and produce Chinese film works that promote pornography, ghosts and gods, and the beautification of peace, and transport them to Japan and its colonies to promote the achievements of the "Imperial Army" and cover up its atrocities in China. (The above two points are based on the conclusions of the "Symposium on Japanese Mainland Policy and Its Trends" held by the Propaganda Department of the Japanese Special Service Agency on Changan Street, Beiping, on June 10 last year, the conclusion of Wen Fangsu, Director of the Cultural Bureau of the Puppet Provisional Government, that "Sino-Japanese friendship should start with film," and the proposals of Ichiide Aya, President of the Japanese International Eisho News, all of which are found in Japanese "International Eisho News" Nos. 1216 and Japanese Eisho Mainland Development Issue) The cultural traitor Zhang Liansheng (Donghe Film Company) advocated that "Japanese film activities in China must not add the names of Japan or Manchuria to the films. It is best to appear entirely in the guise of Chinese films, with no relationship to Japan or Manchuria on the surface, and to make it appear to be entirely a Chinese business." He also advocated that "no matter what, love must be the center, and this kind of inherited love must be quite rich. Whether it is acting or actors, there must be a considerable dramatic flavor, and it must be performed in a very vulgar way." This proposal was naturally adopted.

The conspiracy of the silver offensive has thus unfolded, and the minions who carry out this conspiracy are active at home and abroad, as well as in those special cities close to the motherland. According to a report in a Hong Kong newspaper on February 7, there are some speculative film merchants in Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and the Americas who, under the pretext of maintaining business, transport films to North China for screening at a price of about 4,000 yuan. This is, of course, just one example of the expansion of the silver conspiracy. There are many more facts that have not been revealed or made public! Here, we only dare to tell the relevant authorities, film merchants, and film and theater workers: First, Japanese fascists are carrying out cultural aggression against us, and even in terms of silver aggression alone, they have a fairly broad and complete plan, and they are spending a considerable amount of money. Just look at the Tokyo telegram from the Associated Press on February 7, saying that the Japanese government announced that it would soon send an entertainment ship to Guangdong, carrying 150 wireless radios, 600 phonographs, 12,000 Chinese propaganda films, 18,000 chess sets, and countless Japanese films. This shows one aspect of it. What we hold to win the final victory in the War of Resistance is the centralized leadership of the nation's vital forces. Although we are not afraid of any Japanese appeasement propaganda conspiracy, we should be vigilant in view of the active actions of the enemy and the inadequacy of our mobilization work. The highest leader has already determined the principle that political work is more important than military affairs and propaganda is more important than organization in the second phase of the War of Resistance. We should, under this principle, intensify the general mobilization of the cultural sector, especially the film and theater industry, which is closest to the masses, on the one hand, to eliminate the smoke and conspiracies of traitors, and on the other hand, to increase the power to centralize and lead the nation's vital forces. Secondly, we should widely and deeply carry out the movement to eliminate the old and create the new in film and theater, on the one hand, to eliminate the corrupt and evil elements in film and theater, and on the other hand, to strengthen the progressive elements, promote the backward elements, and establish a solid anti-Japanese united front, so that the national film and theater can serve China's War of Resistance and the world's anti-fascist aggression. In addition, since the fall of Shanghai, Chinese film practitioners have suffered a major blow. Since the fall of Guangzhou, film practitioners in South China have lost the markets of Shiqi, Jiangmen, and Taishan. Therefore, a small number of blind and unscrupulous elements are carrying out speculation and are willingly used by traitors. We should also make proper arrangements to prevent all dangerous tendencies and open up a righteous path. We believe that sensitive film practitioners will never willingly degenerate and be used by traitors. This relies heavily on the close cooperation of film and theater practitioners, cultural workers, and the media. May each work hard!

The "Era" Performs Cao Yu's Famous Play

Fanyi and Zhou Ping (played by Peng Guohua and Zhang Ying) in "Thunderstorm"

### Startle the Eyes, Raise Your Head, and Start Walking! The Past and Future of the Era Theater Troupe

— Qiu Luo

The "Era Theater Troupe" appeared in Hong Kong, where dramatic theory and practice were exceptionally weak, with a youthful and enterprising attitude. "Era" had no money, no backstage backers, relying only on the mouths of its members and the troupe leaders, and a spirit of hard work and perseverance. In half a year of arduous struggle, they surprisingly opened up a new chapter for drama in Hong Kong. The arrival of the China Traveling Theater Troupe certainly gave Hong Kong drama a new stimulus, but the one who planted the seeds was still "Era," and "Era" also yielded good fruit. Now, there are twenty or thirty drama groups in Hong Kong, expanding and developing.

The "Era Theater Troupe" is actually the successor of the drama group of the early Chinese Arts Association and the South China Drama Research Society. The number of people is the same; it's just a change of name but not substance. Years ago, "South China" performed plays such as "Lugou Bridge" and "Thunderstorm" at the Ko Shing Theatre. Although it was a business failure, it was at that time that drama began to gain the attention of businessmen. In the history of the drama movement in South China, they were no strangers to the audience.

Subsequently, the South China Drama Research Society planned to go to the South Sea Islands, attempting to fulfill a bit of propaganda responsibility for the country in an environment where they could make a living. "South China" sent director Li Zhiqing to negotiate with businessmen, but unfortunately, it failed. The reason for the failure was mostly that businessmen believed that drama would lose money, and they would rather use the capital for drama to make movies. Lu Dun Jun once told reporters, with the general meaning that drama would not and should not fail. It's just that drama does not have a fixed business model and is fundamentally different from movies. For example, a movie in the three regions of Nanyang, Annam, and Siam could sell for four thousand yuan, while drama does not have such a fixed price. Therefore, conservative businessmen do not treat drama and movies the same way, and the way out for drama is forgotten in the subjective and erroneous estimation of the businessmen's secret calculations. I agree with Lu Dun Jun's insightful view that if drama can gradually capture the audience, then, with good business, profit-seeking businessmen will be willing to consider it unconditionally.

After the failure of "South China's" trip to Nanyang, they filmed a movie, still using members of South China as the backbone. That movie was "Generational Feuds," directed by Li Zhiqing. After the movie was finished, "South China" also came to an end.

For a period, everyone waited quietly for an opportunity. Soon, the "Era Theater Troupe" began to organize and establish itself. "Era" first performed at the Central Theatre, successively staging "The Eve," "Roar of the Ancient City," "Night Luminous Cup," and "Paint Not Dry" from 9 am to 1 pm every day. Both business and performance were rapidly progressing upward, and businessmen held meetings to discuss the drama business. This was clearly a great improvement compared to the previous year.

Era's performances led to the continuous organization and emergence of numerous drama groups. The domestic drama atmosphere also surged rapidly to the island, with "China Traveling Theater Troupe" being the most prominent. The "China Traveling Theater Troupe" continuously staged many famous plays at the Taiping and Puqing Theatres, giving businessmen a new understanding. At the same time, under the influence of friendly forces, the Era Theater Troupe recently obtained the right to perform at night.

Their first phase of work—regular performances—coincided with the arrival of the renowned playwright Ouyang Yuqian, who agreed to be the director of the troupe, just as the fifth performance ended. After this planning period, promoting the Hong Kong drama movement became even more active.

Since December of last year, under the guidance of Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, they have been busy rehearsing. The sixth performance was in Macau. Now, starting from the 10th of this month, they will perform for four consecutive days at the Puqing Theatre in Kowloon, as the seventh grand performance of the second phase. The repertoire includes the famous trilogy by the national first-class playwright Cao Yu—"Wilderness," "Sunrise," "Thunderstorm"—and the recent national defense satirical comedy "The New Official Takes Office" by the famous playwright Chen Baichen. These plays are all outstanding works, coupled with their well-trained skills and Mr. Ouyang's leadership, success can be expected.

Currently, both business and performance are quite optimistic. Originally, those engaged in drama do not need to be concerned about business issues. However, theatre owners believe that without business, they will not allow performances. This is an ironclad fact. We who are engaged in drama should target this environment and first make the original performance a success, so as to gain the support of a broad audience. With the support of a broad audience, businessmen will be happy to cooperate. What else is in the minds of businessmen besides money? Therefore, we do not advocate high-sounding theories but must recognize the correct path, work hard, and the Era Theater Troupe is sure to have a future.

Therefore, I believe that since the "Era Theater Troupe" has gone through arduous struggles and arduous management, it should continue to pursue its original aspiration and seek a way out in the future. As for the people of Era, they also have good training. As long as they keep going, they will surely achieve complete success. Finally, what I hope for from "Era" is to be neither arrogant nor complacent, to be calm and courageous, to recognize the mission of wartime art, and to start walking towards the bright road with eyes raised and heads held high.

### Special Recommendation: "The New Official Takes Office," Performed by Era Tonight

"The New Official Takes Office" is a four-act national defense satirical comedy recently written by the famous playwright Chen Baichen, depicting the ugly state of shameless traitors in the occupied areas vying for power and profit, highlighting the cruel oppression of innocent people by the enemy. The content is substantial, profound, and humorous. It was noticed by both the Era Theater Troupe and the China Art Theater Troupe at the same time a month ago, and both began carefully rehearsing it under the direction of the great drama master Ouyang Yuqian. Last month, it was performed separately in Hong Kong and Macau, with each achieving its own merits. We have already had an article introducing this in the seventh issue of this magazine. Now, "Era" has specially scheduled a grand performance for tonight (Sunday) during its seventh expanded performance. Here, the performance in Cantonese is considered a first. With Mr. Ouyang's directorial style and their refined art, it is worthy of our special recommendation. Please remember: 8 pm tonight, at the Puqing Theatre in Kowloon.

### Era's Task

— Hu Chunbing

While drama workers in the mainland are bravely and collectively participating in the battle, coordinating with military mobilization to inspire the fighting will of the people and strengthen the political education of soldiers, drama workers on the isolated island feel a little bewildered. On the one hand, in the safe rear of the rear, solidarity is not as solid as in the mainland, the work is not as intense as in the mainland, the target audience is different, and the environmental conditions are different. As a result, a united front has not been established. Where should drama workers go?

Mainly, drama appears as a form of entertainment, and this entertainment has not yet gained the universal support of the masses with low cultural levels. On the other hand, because of its revolutionary nature and technical immaturity, it cannot gain the understanding and appreciation of the "higher-class Chinese." It remains among the progressive intellectuals, and is a more powerful tool for self-education, a kind of artistic tool for preaching and persuading young people, or it only becomes a crude program for occasional "assistance," or an extreme reaction against the popular Cantonese opera and films. Can we, drama workers, be satisfied with this?

No, definitely not. Before the sacred War of Resistance began, the salvation movement was deeply rooted in the foundation laid by drama. That is to say, they used advanced stage techniques (such as stage splendor) and mature performing arts (gathering a large number of trained actors and stars) to win over the backward urban masses, arousing their sense of justice and patriotism. After the start of the War of Resistance, the efforts of businessmen's service movements were largely the result of this artistic infection. At the same time, it made professional drama troupes possible, established a regular new force in the drama movement, and made film art also have a sense of the times, and had to take a big step forward by following the content and imagery of stage plays. Now, in Shanghai, an isolated island that has been reduced to a guerrilla zone, there are still many drama workers working hard and technically, so that the establishment of drama theory and the supply of progressive scripts have not been interrupted.

They should at least do this.

No, we cannot stop at doing this. Hong Kong is not Shanghai. China in 1939 in the struggle is even more different from the population that was insulted and harmed after July 7th. The sparks of the War of Resistance have illuminated the world, and the giant waves of patriotism have stirred the hearts of every class, every region, and every man and woman. The masses demand bloody, rational, war-related, epic dramas more urgently than anything else. But what has failed is us. In terms of work enthusiasm, we lag far behind the aspirations of the masses. In terms of content and form, we cannot surpass the old products to meet the needs of the times. At this time, compared with Shanghai before, we must continue and expand our national liberation movement's mirror and engine of drama innovation more progressively and actively. We must not only professionalize it, popularize it, and win over the citizens, but also treat it as a practical tool for serving the War of Resistance, especially for the wounded soldiers, refugees, all the suffering compatriots, and all the forces, and strive to build a free and happy new China!

Combining the construction of professional drama troupes with service work groups, using professional efforts to seek more welfare for more people, and creating value outside of commodities with new drama, and serving national liberation. This is the first task of the era.

Constantly researching, constantly practicing, and politically aware, so that artistic achievements do not deviate from the progressing society and the growing nation. This is the second task of the era.

Becoming opponents of old dramas and low-level anesthetic films, using the rhythm of reality to break the anesthetic of traitorous nature, and giving film practitioners and phenomena a strong stimulus, so that films will not be abandoned by the times, and drama will become a research institute and a baptismal temple for film actors and phenomena. This is the third task of the era.

Establishing a mechanized drama guerrilla team, acting as a liaison and organizer for mainland drama units, and creating an audience for more advanced dramas. This is the fourth task of the era.

Through the common emotions of the world, using realistic images to lead the people of the world who love peace to recognize the war in China on the front lines of peace, and rise up to extinguish the robbers who destroy culture due to the resonance of human conscience! This is the fifth task of the era.

Coordinating with the work of national construction, creating art worthy of the great Chinese nation, and preparing good spiritual food for the new generation. This is the last (but not the least important) task of the era.

### Second Performance of Reed Beacon

The Reed Beacon Drama Society of South China Middle School in Hong Kong has been working quite actively since its establishment.

The repertoire included two one-act plays, "Reunion" and "Sack Team." The venue was the South China Middle School Auditorium, and the time was 7:30 pm. The performance was quite successful.

### Red and White Drama Troupe Born

Recently, a new and powerful drama troupe—the Red and White Drama Troupe—has been born in the Hong Kong drama scene! Several dozens of members are all hardworking drama workers from Guangzhou and the mainland in the past. Currently, they are intensifying rehearsals for the four-act play "Dog," also known as "County Magistrate." In the future, they will successively rehearse famous plays such as "Thunderstorm," "Duska," and "The Bandit Captain."

### Stock Market Conditions More Sluggish Yesterday

Yesterday was Saturday, and the Hong Kong stock market was only open for half a day in the morning. The situation was even more sluggish. However, most stock prices were tighter. For example, HSBC's 1415 yuan and Chinese Estates' 100 yuan were both higher than the market conditions in the past week. Unfortunately, most investors were unwilling to sell, resulting in no significant transactions. The various stock prices yesterday are recorded below:

### Conspiracy to Eliminate My Silk Industry

— Wu Ma

The latter is to move valuable things (please pay attention to the word "valuable") to the rear as much and as quickly as possible, such as the provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi, and Sichuan, in order to cooperate with the government to develop the silk industry in the southwest. At the same time, burn down the silkworm rooms to prevent them from being used by the Japanese. Because the government has repeatedly stated that it is very much in need of private capital and technology, and this is the time when the people of the whole country are doing their part, all kinds of production enterprises should follow the government to move west. Except for those who are directly engaged in guerrilla work and those who are indirectly disrupting the Japanese rule, there is no reason to live in the occupied areas. Now, it happens that the occupied areas are not allowed to linger on. Then, in addition to moving to the guerrilla force area, there is no doubt that they can only join the silk production camp in the rear. Fortunately, with the past experience of silkworm seed operators in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, whether in terms of operation or technology, it is enough to do pioneering work in a region where the silk industry is barren, and the government is also assisting.

(I think some larger seed farms are strong enough to advance on both routes at the same time.)

In short, if we can resolutely adopt these two routes as an emergency countermeasure under the current Japanese oppression, then what is lost in the east can still be recovered in the west. If we are frantic and willing to be economic slaves under the name of "cooperation" with the Japanese, and follow the example of silk factories in Wuxi and other places, then not only will the operators of silkworm seed farms ruin their personal reputation and become the scum of the silkworm industry, but they will also be criminals of the Chinese nation. For merit or for crime, it is all in this moment. While the Japanese are starting to attack silkworm seed factories in the war zone, and the silkworm seed factories themselves have not betrayed China and are willing to be vassals of the Japanese, I respectfully publish what I know in the newspapers to expose the Japanese conspiracy against the silkworm seed industry in the war zone and promote the rapid and profound awakening of the silkworm seed industry.

### After Three Battles, South China Defeats Kowloon and Secures Silver Shield Semi-Final Spot; Fung King-cheung Scores Twice with Excellent Headers

(Report from our newspaper) After two matches that failed to determine a winner, the South China South team faced the Kowloon Club in a special Silver Shield replay yesterday. The two teams held their third decisive battle at So Kon Po Stadium, attracting thousands of fans eager to witness the outcome.

This match was a matter of life and death for both teams. Failure meant elimination, so both sides were determined to win and secure a semi-final spot. After 70 minutes of intense competition, South China lived up to expectations, eliminating Kowloon with a score of 2-1. The match was a back-and-forth affair, filled with brilliant moments, truly a rare spectacle.

South China's performance was full of vigor, with Fung King-cheung, Cheung Wing-choi, and Leung Wing-chiu being particularly outstanding.

Lo Dou-man also returned to his usual form, playing a role in both goals. Li Yan-leung, in his debut major match, performed well, showing promise. It is hoped that the South China Football Committee will pay close attention to him, as he is destined for great things in the future.

South China's victory was due to the strong support from the half-back line, which moved forward and backward with coordination. Leung Wing-chiu was especially courageous. The forwards' ability to be active was largely due to their excellent performance, but also greatly benefited from the cover and support of the half-backs. However, Lau Hing-choi's movements seemed a bit slow, though he was able to remain calm and composed amidst the slowness.

Kowloon's defeat was due to being less skilled than their opponents. Moreover, the players placed too much importance on this match and were too eager, too anxious to win. As a result, their performance was erratic and excessive. Their five forwards created many opportunities and showed bursts of speed, but their anxiety led to disarray, and their coordination was lacking, often faltering in the final moments when penetrating South China's territory.

The three half-backs performed at most competently, with Beresford being especially seasoned and skilled. One of the inner-backs was also adequate. The goalkeeper, King Lai, seemed too serious, constantly worried about conceding when South China's forwards attacked, leading him to rush out of the goal several times, increasing the danger.

Match details are recorded below. The formations of the two teams during the match were as follows:

(South China South)

Cheung Wing-choi

Li Tin-sang, Mak Siu-han

Li Kwok-wai, Leung Wing-chiu, Lau Hing-choi

Lo Dou-man, Li Yan-leung, Fung King-cheung, Lai Siu-wing, Tang Kwong-sam

(Kowloon Club)

Kriegel

Nye

Wolfe

Lister

Knox

Nee, Beresford, Max

Borrows, Loveridge, Stephenson, Visocchi, Knowles

As the whistle blew, the god of war descended. The ordinary spectators held their breath, watching the unfolding drama.

King-cheung led the charge, clearing the way. He encountered Beresford halfway and battled for a round before being forced to retreat.

Borrows launched a rebellion on the flank, with fierce momentum. Siu-han, responsible for defending the territory, knew the attacker was ill-intentioned and swiftly intervened, causing the enemy general to flee.

Meanwhile, Knowles launched a light cavalry sneak attack with malicious intent. Approaching the goal line, he cut the ball inside. Stephenson, thinking there was an opportunity, rushed forward, but before he reached the city walls, South China's defenders had already seized the "A Dou."

At this moment, Kowloon's three half-backs were covering the forward attack, leaving their defense vulnerable. They did not anticipate South China's counterattack to be so rapid. Just as they were about to turn back, King-cheung had already overtaken them. Seeing a promising path ahead, he passed the ball, and Dou-man, receiving it, advanced further. In an instant, he had penetrated deep into enemy territory. He then cut the ball perfectly, finding King-cheung, who was in great spirits. Seizing this golden opportunity, he had no reason to let it pass. As the ball descended, he struck it with his head, forcing the goalie's defenses to open up. Though he tried to save it, it was too late. The patriotic fans cheered, celebrating South China's opening goal.

After South China's victory, their morale soared. The five tigers of the forward line performed like dragons fighting for a pearl, like lions rolling a ball, a truly magnificent sight. Kowloon's defenders were trapped in a corner, their city on the verge of collapse. They barely managed to resist with all their might, preventing further losses. However, in this situation, it was clear that South China had the upper hand, and most spectators were convinced that victory would belong to South China.

After struggling for a while, Kowloon finally broke through. Beresford supported in midfield, and Stephenson, Visocchi, and Loveridge attacked from three directions. Wing-chiu met them head-on, exuding imposing authority. Soon after, Beresford took a free kick outside South China's fortress. Tin-sang headed the ball clear, protecting the capital.

Moments later, South China's vanguard launched another attack. Wolfe, seeing the approaching army, panicked, regretting his mistake of touching the ball with his hand. The referee, witnessing this, showed no favoritism, enforcing the law impartially and awarding a penalty kick. The patriotic fans were overjoyed, believing South China had found an opportunity to score another goal. However, King-cheung's kick lacked power, and Kriegel, alert and perceptive, saw King-cheung shoot to the right and followed the ball's trajectory, diving and successfully averting a disaster. A wave of sighs and applause arose from the stands.

Escaping danger, Kowloon's troops rallied, seeking weaknesses and launching a counterattack. Soon after, Borrows attacked from the left, firing a cold shot. Fortunately, Wing-choi was prepared and thwarted his plan. However, at this moment, Kowloon's offensive was strong, and in the blink of an eye, they forced a corner kick. The players gathered in front of South China's goal. Wolfe, stationed at the rear, also advanced, launching a long-range shot like a shooting star. Wing-choi, with quick eyes and hands, caught it cleanly.

King-cheung led the attack, and the situation looked promising, but several attempts failed to hit the target. After a while, Siu-wing tried his luck, launching a shot into the net. However, he was ruled offside, disappointing the patriotic fans.

The battle became increasingly intense, like hand-to-hand combat. The spectators were entranced, and both sides' forwards found opportunities to shoot, but they were all saved by the goalkeepers. The first half soon ended.

After a brief rest, the battle resumed. Kowloon's players were determined to recover lost ground, showing exceptional courage. Before anyone could react, Stephenson and Visocchi had reached the city walls. South China's defenders fought hard, and the situation stabilized.

Siu-wing received the ball and passed it to the left. Dou-man, catching it, went straight for the goal. Kriegel, seeing this, panicked and rushed out to intercept, but Dou-man outmaneuvered him. At this point, Kriegel was as good as a condemned prisoner, but Dou-man's final touch sent the ball wide. It was a great pity.

Kwong-sam rose to the occasion, leading his troops deep into enemy territory. He fired a shot at the goal, but it missed. However, Dou-man was lying in ambush on the left, waiting for an opportunity. Seeing the ball coming, he intercepted it perfectly. King-cheung, supporting in the center, repeated his previous tactic, scoring again with an excellent header. The audience cheered, shaking the valley, and South China's victory became even more assured.

Kowloon's players were disheartened by their repeated losses, especially the three forwards, who showed aggressive behavior in their desperate counterattacks.

During a midfield battle, Beresford suddenly passed the ball forward. Stephenson followed up with a thrust. Tin-sang, guarding the front line alone, should have been safe, but he carelessly slipped, creating an opportunity for Stephenson, who seized it and broke through. Wing-choi, in this desperate situation, had no way to save it. He opened the goal, allowing Stephenson to shoot and score. This loss for South China was completely undeserved. Even experienced players like Tin-sang can make unexpected mistakes.

Kowloon's unexpected goal was like finding life in a desperate situation, greatly boosting their morale. They aimed to score another goal and overturn the defeat, while South China's players wanted to maintain their lead and complete the victory. Therefore, everyone was preoccupied, and the situation was extremely tense.

Soon after, South China's three forwards launched an attack. Siu-wing rushed in, and Kriegel was trapped. Wolfe and Lister tried their best to rescue him. After some difficulties, they managed to avert disaster.

Borrows attacked, and Siu-han forcefully repelled him. Max, supporting from the road, launched a long-range shot. Wing-choi caught it cleanly.

After that, the two teams took turns attacking and defending, with many more brilliant moments, but the score remained unchanged. As the match ended, South China finally secured a 2-1 victory, eliminating Kowloon and securing a semi-final spot. (The Football God)

Chung Sing has many strong players, such as Xie Weimin, Ren Jiesheng, and Guo Qun, who were selected for the Shanghai team, so they are very strong.

### Hong Kong-Shanghai Tennis Match: China Defeats Shanghai Students; China Recreation Club Wins Two Singles and Two Doubles; Only Li Huitang Lost One Game

Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, the Shanghai Student Tennis Team competed against the China Recreation Club team at the China Club court in Causeway Bay. As a result, the China Recreation Club won 4-1.

First Singles Match: By Hong Kong

The overall champion Tsui Wai-pui against Tang Po-ka, the Shanghai Chinese champion, the first game Tsui took the lead with three to zero, but was quickly caught up, making it a tie. Tsui was afraid of losing again, and quickly adopted net blocking and cross-court tactics, winning six to four. In the second game, Tang fought bravely, running tirelessly, but made frequent mistakes and lost several games in a row. Tsui then used long shots and short passes, feinting east and attacking west, to win the second game six to one. Total 2-0 victory.

Second Singles Match: Li Huitang vs. Li Kwok-fan, Li had a slight foot injury and was not agile, losing two games in a row.

Third Singles Match: By Li Yu-wing against Tsai Kwok-kei, the skills of both sides were comparable. The battle was very resilient, attacking and defending each other, and it took a long time to determine the result. So after the first singles and second singles games, the two of them were still in the second game. As a result, Li won two to one. The first doubles game Xu Jiang against Tang Li was one of the most exciting scenes in the game. Tang Li's connection and strength were far better than Xu's. Although Xu Jiang was able to take the lead with five to one in the first game, after Tang Li's rapid chase, they completed it in one go, making the situation five to five. Tang Li then won the first game eight to six. In the second game, Xu Jiang frequently went online, using a combination of pumping and pressing, and regained the lost ground six to four. In the third game, Jiang Daozhang gradually lost his strength, and his shots were not as good as before. Tang Li saw the weakness and repeatedly chopped the ball towards Jiang's side, causing Jiang to sweat profusely and pant like a bull. The scores of both sides were ebb and flow, and neither side would give in, making it difficult to distinguish. Xiao Xu finally used the net blocking skill again in the last two games, narrowly defeating Tang Li with eleven to nine.

Second Doubles Match: By Hung Yiu against Wai Tsai, Hung Yiu had a tacit cooperation and won two games in a row with six to one and six to three. The wins were easy. The scores of each game are listed below,

Singles

Tsui Wai-pui defeated Tong Po-ka

6-4 6-1

Li Huitang lost to Li Kwok-fan

3-6 1-6

### Movies and Drama

Entertainment ... Three Loves Has Nancy

Is a typical Hollywood romantic comedy. The witty and lively dialogue, a lot of jokes, the vivid performances of the actors, plus a very interesting four-corner love story, make this film a very perfect and entertaining comedy.

The content is about a country girl going to a big city to find her fiancé, making a lot of jokes, and then how she had a crazy and hilarious love story with a writer and the publisher of the writer's books under special circumstances.

This film grasps a fragment of modern urban life and develops it, showing it very briskly. Director Rfchard Thorpe has very rich experience in handling comedies, not only sketching the whole film with an incomparably humorous style, but also every shot is full of rich humorous interest. Every inch of the film makes the audience have no chance to stop laughing. Jenna Kina plays the village girl in the film, showing a very cute personality. She portrays the pure and peaceful heart of a country girl and the distrust of urban friends very well, making her the most outstanding character in the film. Robert Montgomery and Frank Toton, who play the writer and publisher respectively, also have very wonderful and excellent performances. This film can be said to be the first collaboration and successful work of the three stars.

Queen ... A Man To Remember

For viewers who like touching stories, this film is the most ideal work. The film depicts the history of the life, failure, and success of a rural doctor, using a retrospective method to develop various scenes, narrating how the doctor served the society and the poor for twenty years with a spirit of sacrifice. At the same time, the film also unambiguously exposes the ugly state of selfishness and self-interest of villains in society.

Aiwa Ellis plays a doctor in the film who has no degree but has great ability and excellent talent. With the desire to serve the people, he returned to his hometown with his young son. But those who dared to trust him were only some poor farmers. The rewards he received were only some agricultural products. One of his harvests during a consultation was the baby girl he had just delivered for someone. He continued to struggle without discouragement, educating his son to get a very high degree, but to his disappointment, this son only pursued fame and money, with only the adopted daughter as his only help and comfort. Finally, he used his foresight to save the children of the whole village from a dangerous infectious disease, and only then did he receive the sincere respect and love of the whole village.

Ansa Li, who plays the doctor's adopted daughter, also has an excellent performance.

Also showing "The March of Time", which has a very detailed narrative and incisive dissection of the internal and external causes of Hitler's invasion of Czechoslovakia.

Ping An ... The Storm

Describing the dissolute and indifferent lives of some seafarers, the director handles several tense scenes and climaxes in the film quite movingly. Charles Bohor plays a radio operator on a ship who gets into trouble everywhere, and how he bravely fights for his younger brother, and finally helps his sister-in-law save his brother's life in a storm.

The film describes the lives of people on the ship, how they squander their time and how they earnestly perform their duties, vividly and thoroughly. The performances of the actors show a kind of impatient and unreasonable personality, and the acting of fighting, causing trouble, drunkenness, flirting, and gambling are all vivid and energetic.

Eastern ... The Adventures of Tom Sawyer

A popular masterpiece by the American writer Mark Twain, which has been filmed once in the past. The excellent acting skills of the actress Missy Green may still be remembered by some people. This time, it is dyed in color, making the scenery of the countryside even more vivid. The performances of the two child stars Tommy Kelly and Angeles are also very moving. Tommy Kelly also fully shows that he is a promising child star - as long as there is a suitable script.

The movie is very long, but because the director's technique is superb and the tone is always light and smooth, people don't feel any slackness in it. This film can be regarded as a top-notch work for adapting a literary work into a movie.

Mero Robertson, who plays the grandmother, is also worth mentioning, although there are very few scenes.

Ta Hwa ... Double Wedding

William Powell and Mona Lo have been partners for a long time and have always given us a very good impression. Of course, there are many who love their films. This film is also very successful, although the plot is not how outstanding. Continuing the Cantonese film Seven Fresh Roses

The previous episode of Seven Fresh Roses said that Ma Lau-fun married Lin Mei-mei. This episode tells that after Lin gave birth, Ma and Lin had a bad relationship. At the same time, it also tells that after Feng Feng and Xu Man-li got married, they had conflicts due to a bad relationship, and each went to extremes. Then it tells that Ma Lau-fun met Xu Man-li by chance, and the two fell in love. The old couple found out and stated that Ma and Xu were originally engaged. So both sides realized and Ma fled even further. As a result, he was moved by his son and still returned home, and his love with Lin was as good as ever. A Midsummer Night's Dream

Central ... A Midsummer Night's Dream

Cantonese film

Adapted from "Flowers in the Mirror", but it goes a step further than "Flowers in the Mirror". The whole play takes Xin Ma Shi-zeng as the starting point, telling that Xin Ma was originally a waiter in a teahouse. One night in his dream, he saw the God of Longevity, so the God of Longevity took him to various places to play, such as Nantianmen, Beitiandou, the land of giants, the land of dwarves, etc., allowing him to see all kinds of miracles he had never seen before. Watching this movie, you really just have to pretend you're dreaming.

The whole play, from beginning to end, is extremely scattered, and the plot has no central point at all. I believe progressive audiences will not welcome such films. The songs sung are a few old songs.

Tai Ping ... The Four King Brothers

National film

Changed from a silent film to a sound film, from monochrome to color, this remade film is much more advanced materially. The male lead is Wang Yin, but the female lead is a newcomer, Zhang Tsui-yu. The scenes are great, which is its advancement.

Lee Theatre ... Sequel to Golden Leaf Chrysanthemum

Cantonese film

Poo Hing ... Drama

Day performance - Sunrise

Night performance - The New Official Takes Office

### On Women

— Zhang Chunfeng

Yu Yan's "Rotten Talks at the Banquet" volume states: "Man is like Heaven, woman is like Earth. The rain and dew of Heaven never fail to moisten, but the Earth has differences in fertility and barrenness. Some produce life, some do not. If the Earth is thin, saline, or full of rubble, to blame it for not producing life is like carving ice to make fire, or searching for red in a basket. It is merely wishful thinking and will yield nothing." This can indeed be called a new theory on women of the old days.

Perhaps in the verifiable documents of China, women have never attained the status of "person." Here, comparing women to the Earth, with its divisions of thinness and barrenness, and its capacity to produce life or not, is a representative concept of old traditional thought. I remember a common saying in my northeastern hometown, "Women are like seeds; they thrive when scattered on fertile land, and wither when scattered on barren land." This is another fatalistic view, comparing women to seeds, but ultimately, still not as a person.

The best representative of this view is our Confucius, who uttered the contemptuous words, "Only women and petty men are difficult to nurture." Because women are the most unreliable and difficult to restrain, there are strict ritual regulations in the ancient "Classic of Filial Piety": "Within the women's quarters, are rituals and righteousness complete?" Even in the era of Mencius, he believed that pacifying the world and dominating the four directions required first controlling women, as he said, "Regulate your wife, then your brothers, so as to govern your family and state." This clearly implies that "women are a source of trouble." To pacify the world, one must naturally first quell the source of trouble.

As for whether women are qualified as people, in ancient China, this case was quite difficult to argue because the prosecutor and plaintiff were both men, while women were fundamentally barred from court and denied the right to defend themselves. Consequently, a one-sided guilty verdict was rendered here.

Thankfully, the times are the advocate for women. Today, it seems that all the guilty verdicts of the past have been overturned, and women can follow the times and gradually embark on a new path. At the same time, some women today have not only caught up with the times but are also ahead of the times, acting as teachers to men.

Unfortunately, women's endeavors seem to always be skewed toward one aspect of development. For example, Japanese women are dedicated to sacrificing their bodies as the best strategy for serving the nation and developing national power. Even we use "Japan relies on soldiers, ronin, and prostitutes" as a derogatory saying about Japan.

Speaking of our country, nine months ago, a Chinese woman in Nanyang even proclaimed a vow to dedicate herself to the nation, promising to become a lifelong partner to anyone who purchased 10,000 yuan of national bonds. Unfortunately, this occurred in Nanyang, and there has been no follow-up. Furthermore, a news item was published in a certain evening newspaper on September 23rd of last year:

"Recently, Chinese and Western individuals held a banquet at the Wuzhou Chinese-Western Restaurant. When the wine was flowing freely, a Mr. X from the Asia Company proposed that if any female students were willing to offer a kiss, the gentlemen present would compete to donate money. The one who donated the most would receive the kiss. As a result, in a short time, thousands of yuan were collected. Mr. Tom, a Westerner, donated the most, offering 340 yuan each to female students Hua Jichen and Jie Zhen for a kiss."

Regardless of whether this represents an outflow of rights and interests, exchanging a kiss for hundreds of legal tender seems like a very worthwhile deal. Moreover, the ones offering kisses were single women. Of course, to align with the current principle of "everyone striving to save the nation in their respective positions," some might think this is the most appropriate thing to do.

However, the Nanyang Chinese woman's call for a husband to save the nation is not very reasonable. As for the Wuzhou students offering kisses, it was still proposed during the "wine-fueled enthusiasm" of men. Such methods of saving the nation are certainly not what we endorse because women in the new era have already created a nobler, greater, and holier path in today's war of resistance.

### Ruins and Gunsmoke

— Written by Shiro Ozaki, translated by Huanping Lin

The Colonel, while explaining, spoke to her frequently with an attitude that was both familiar and distant. Someone in the group took out a cigarette to offer her. She made a surprised face and refused. When it was offered to her again and again, a girlish shyness surfaced on her face. She reluctantly took it, lit it, and began to smoke it with great enjoyment. In the square a little earlier, there was a coolie with a villainous appearance, using a knife that did not seem sharp enough to cut off the meat tightly adhering to a raw pigskin. In Hukou, it was said that the mountain painter Hiroshi Kitchida had already been there for a week. Led by Lieutenant Tanaka, we climbed Stone Bell Mountain, and soon we were covered in sweat. When we came down, the mooring base had prepared lunch. Canned beef and red-eyed fish—a pot of cold sake was also placed before my dining table. Here, we met Mr. Yoshida, who at first glance seemed like a reserve officer. He clinked glasses and drank with Lieutenant Matsuoka, our guide, who was sitting next to him, and they gradually became drunk. In the afternoon, we took a sampan prepared by Colonel Inoue and climbed Great Aunt Mountain, which stood in the middle of the lake. If there were any old Chinese people who had not escaped, they could probably hear all sorts of legends. The lake was probably full of bottomless legends; Great Aunt Mountain harbored the historical image of two thousand years. It was said that even schools of fish going up the river would first make a greeting before passing Great Aunt Mountain. The origin of this custom was untraceable. But Colonel Inoue also said that today was the first time he had climbed Great Aunt Mountain. "Probably, apart from the military, you are the first Japanese to climb this mountain," he said. From the sampan near Great Aunt Mountain, I looked back at the cityscape of Hukou several times. The afternoon sun shone brightly. But this ruined city seemed to have completely lost the strength to rise again from this odorless silence. On rainy nights, looking out from the windows of the mooring base headquarters, a blue fire flickered in the dark shade of the mountains. Colonel Inoue said this, and his face darkened: "It's not one or two, it's five or six overlapping, wandering like they are lost from this mountain to that valley. At first, I thought it wasn't a guerrilla team of X people? So, in the night, I ordered the guards to set out to see, but there was no trace of that, and, moreover, there were no corpses of X people nearby. It seems like it's will-o'-the-wisp, but it's hard to say."

Listening to his conversation, the desolate night street turned into a bizarre form, floating into my mind. The war shattered all the strange phenomena that arose in the peripheral nerves and progressed. Today, in the gaps between the appearance of ghosts hiding personal hatred, there are probably none anymore. I think there probably won't be another chance for me to revisit this city alive. (End)

Postscript: The author, Shiro Ozaki, is a famous Japanese pure art writer. He writes war literature with the pursuit of artistic beauty as the primary premise. The aggressive intentions of the Japanese militarists do not seem to play a guiding role in his mind. Therefore, his works are more objective and more in line with the facts. The translator once translated his "Yangtze River Autumn," which was serially published in the "Shen Bao" on December 14, 5, 6, and 7 of last year, and was well-received by readers. This so-called work is published in the New Year's issue of "Reconstruction" magazine. "Ruins and Gunsmoke" is the overall title, divided into four chapters: "In Hukou," "Great Aunt Mountain," "The Romanticism of the Sky," and "Changes in Color." This article is only a selected translation of the first chapter, "In Hukou," because the other three chapters are not worth translating. A few places in the text have been deleted by the translator, specifically mentioned.

### An Analysis of the Psychology of Traitors

— Ge'er

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people once conducted a "psychological analysis" of "traitors." It is said that there are four reasons for the emergence of "traitors": (1) those who do not deeply understand the suffering of being a subjugated people and are either money-worshipers or unemployed; (2) those who believe that resistance will inevitably fail and attempt to establish false merit in advance; (3) those who have received imperial salaries and therefore wish to repay imperial favor; (4) those who are completely ignorant and are either money-worshipers or unemployed.

Regarding the reasons for the emergence of "traitors" in the above items 1 and 4, we can persuade "money-worshipers and the unemployed." Up until now, the brutal acts of the X people have long proven that being a subjugated people is something one should never do. "Japanese Atrocities Eyewitnessed by Foreigners" by the famous British journalist H.J. Timperley is the best book to record the suffering of being a subjugated people. In addition to this, we must also provide relief to the unemployed. Otherwise, asking them to practice saving the country on an empty stomach would mean that the kind of "Bo Yi and Shu Qi" who "refuse to eat the grain of Zhou" probably cannot be found among the "ignorant." In fact, we certainly cannot ask them to learn from "Bo Yi and Shu Qi." The story of "Bo Yi and Shu Qi" should be remembered by the "wealthy and powerful" who are "well-fed and clothed."

Regarding such "traitors" as in items 1 and 3, they are "incurable," and we must inflict relentless flogging upon them. If possible, it would not be excessive to "punish" them by eating their flesh and sleeping on their skin.

Those who have received imperial salaries and therefore repay their imperial favor have long been unworthy of being human. They have already become slaves by nature. This is the true nature of all "house dogs." It is a disgrace to bestow the "title" of "human" upon them. If such "things" are tolerated to exist in the world, they will indeed leave behind endless harm. If they are not eliminated, the future of humanity is truly unimaginable!

However, even more detestable are those "opportunists" who consider themselves "outstanding individuals" who "understand current affairs." Seeing the brutal force of the X people's "three axes," they believe that they are bound to win, and that their own side is bound to lose. Therefore, in order to establish false merit in advance, they glorify themselves by saying, "Who will go to hell if I don't?" and boldly take on "positions" such as "committee member" or "mayor." Of course, some "smart people" adhere to the "three no's policy." They seem to neither desire to establish "false merit" nor appear as solemn "saviors." However, these people are even more detestable. The so-called "cave-dwelling red viper" refers to these cunning and scheming individuals. However, this is not within the scope of my words.

Speaking of the Shanghai "mayor," Chuan Xiaoan, who rides the wind and sees the rudder, embraces the "China will inevitably lose" theory, and establishes false merit in advance, he has recently "shown signs of remorse." The reason is that "the time of China's final victory is indeed unreachable." Therefore, he is extremely dismayed and believes that "in six months, he will probably no longer be able to stand on his feet in Shanghai." This so-called "showing signs of remorse" should not be regarded as his "repentance." Rather, China's protracted war of resistance will only eliminate those who take advantage of opportunities. From the perspective of building a new China in the future, it is indeed very beneficial. The War of Resistance is truly great. Opinions for reporters in Dongjiang

### We Must Faithfully Expose

— Peng Tai

Opinions for Reporters in Dongjiang

Dongjiang, which was once ravaged by the X people, has many aspects, such as disaster relief, the current government leadership, and the people's sentiments, that are worth reporting to allow overseas Chinese to provide more enthusiastic relief and to allow compatriots living far away to care. How heavy is the responsibility of our reporters? Reporters?

The performance of the work has given us concrete proof: The work of the reporters in Dongjiang is still far from their mission. Although some bravely went to the Bo Zeng and Wan border areas, the closest to the X people's fire line, and some painstakingly stepped on the most remote places, it is still not enough. Everyone must admit it!

1.  They can only circle around on lines and points: You can see by flipping through various newspapers. It proves that the reporter's footsteps can only seem to occupy our rivers and mountains like the X people, only in the small area inside the city, around the rivers and roads. For example, the left-wing offensive area during the X people's landing, Apojiao, Renshan, Pinghai, Lingkeng. Baimanghua, Pingshan, Hengyun, Taiwei... and the right-wing Xayong, Aotou, Jinggang, Kwai Chung... areas, were painfully forgotten and not valued. The materials there will definitely not be more valuable than Danshui, Longgang, Huicheng, and Boluo City! That place is already a place where the government's reach is beyond and the work of resisting the enemy is not well done on weekdays. The brutality of the X people, the cunning tricks used by the X people, the misery of the compatriots, and the severity of the disaster all have special blood and tears, which is what people urgently want to know!

2.  Upper-level interviews cannot understand the people's sentiments at the lower levels: Yes, many disaster statistics and governance plans rely on the institutions to give us more complete ones, but they are one-sided and cannot contain everything. What's more, official clichés have been passed down since ancient times? Therefore, we must be close to the people and get the truth from their frank outpouring because they are still dealing with the X people when the X people come. The strangeness in the lost land is something we can't even dream of. Many strange legends are still circulating in front of us, which is indeed material that cannot be abandoned. This is a reflection of the real phenomenon!

3.  Ignoring the hidden pain due to the surface: If you simply write that a few houses were burned down in a certain place, how many people died in a certain place, and empty words such as "the scene is very miserable" and "blood and bones are all over the place," at most it will only temporarily arouse people! As for the farmers whose thousands of acres of bowing rice ears were eaten up by the enemy's donkeys and horses and who did not harvest, when the enemy occupied them, they were threatened and intimidated by the traitors of the maintenance society, and now they are being openly defrauded and secretly squeezed by many people who took the name of the government or armed forces, and forced to extract them, they can't stand it anymore, so they said angrily: "Damn it, we suffered from the 'foreign' ×××, and now we are suffering from the anger of these 'local' ××× sons"? Clear-eyed people certainly know that these words are entirely because they are too tired. The bandits in various parts of Dongjiang have gradually forgotten the "pain of ××× destroying our country and exterminating our species," and the heart of resisting Japan and saving the country has numbly changed, thinking of scraping from the people to make themselves comfortable, we must expose these.

4.  We should frankly point out the gambling in Dongjiang, as well as the smuggling in Dongjiang, and the phenomena that are more or less unavoidable among the various groups in Dongjiang; to the attention of the comrades who save the country, and also to the knowledge of the higher-level government agencies.

And……

The above are all things that we have not done enough, and perhaps we have not paid much attention to them until now. Of course, there are many reasons to limit us and stop us, such as the fact that the security in many places is not peaceful, the traffic in many places is too difficult, and the days we have come to Dongjiang are really short.

In short, in the past, we did little strikes, did our own things, and went our own way, so we did not bear enough responsibility.

In the future, we must organize ourselves, unite together, and converge everyone's opinions, then the problem can be solved layer by layer like a chef peeling spring bamboo shoots! Dongjiang has its revolutionary tradition, and Dongjiang is still a good place for X people to send their lives. We in Dongjiang have the divine duty to promote everything.

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to respond to the call to "unite the reporters of Dongjiang," as a fervent expectation. 1939, 2, 3.

### The Song of the Wanderer

— Yuan Shuipai

Crying is not enough, it is superfluous.

Under the steps of a foreign city, you are a wanderer. Gleaming floors, ochre lips, do not breed compassion, and compassion is not worth much.

Tears cannot conceive, that city, that village, the green homeland, the productive fields, the rivers, and your fellow villagers, like in your dreams, are buried. Buried by black dust, when the killing bird flaps its wings like leather. Violent madness… Tears cannot cleanse these, to make this land suitable for people to live in, a thicker, colored fluid is needed.
