### The Scandalous Behavior of the Japanese Army and Navy

After the Japanese Navy's reckless actions in Xiamen (Amoy) failed, they lost considerable face. Now, they are landing in Shantou, attempting to act recklessly in Chaozhou, while Fuzhou and Wenzhou have also become targets of Japanese aggression. However, the significant setbacks they are likely to encounter are already on the horizon. The Anglo-French Singapore conference has resulted in concrete decisions regarding Anglo-French cooperation in the Far East. If Singapore, the British military fortress in the Far East, allows countries with interests in the Far East, such as France and even the United States, to utilize it, the Japanese Navy's reckless actions in the Pacific will undoubtedly meet the same fate as the Xiamen incident, ending in complete failure. We must understand that the Japanese Navy's recklessness stems, on one hand, from vying for attention with the Army, hoping to impress the domestic elite with their accomplishments. On the other hand, it is driven by Hitler's demands, hoping Japan can strike and restrain Britain and France in the Far East, allowing Germany and Italy to continue weakening and confounding them in Europe. In early June, the Japanese ambassador to Germany, General Oshima, had close interactions with Hitler, discussing the conclusion of a German-Italian-Japanese military alliance. At that time, Oshima generously agreed to Hitler's proposal. However, when Oshima's presumptuous behavior reached Tokyo, it immediately caused a major upheaval in Japanese political circles. The civilian and military factions, the Army and Navy, engaged in fierce infighting. The old man Hiranuma was caught in the middle, struggling to mediate. Dozens of meetings were held without any resolution. Ultimately, Japan did not participate in the German-Italian military alliance, which greatly displeased Hitler.

However, Hitler's disappointment and displeasure with the Japanese Army were even greater than with the Navy. It is rumored that during Oshima's discussions with Germany regarding the military alliance, Hitler stated that the Japanese Army had suffered significant losses in the war of aggression against China and would need at least six to seven months to recover. This might be seen as a way for Hitler to provoke the Japanese military, though that cannot be known for certain. However, when this news reached Tokyo, Army Minister Itagaki felt extremely dejected. Therefore, starting in early June, he challenged the Soviet Union and Mongolia, wanting to show the European accomplices, Germany and Italy, the indelible power of the Japanese Army. The conflict between the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo and the Soviet Union and Mongolia had not been officially announced until the other day. Only Japanese propaganda about their victories was reported. However, the facts now prove that the Japanese Army did indeed attack Soviet and Mongolian forces. In these attacks, they were met with swift retaliation from the Soviet and Mongolian armies. Despite Japanese official propaganda claiming the inferiority of Soviet aircraft and the number of Soviet aircraft shot down by Japanese planes, the reality proves that during the first Japanese aerial incursion, sixty-five aircraft were destroyed. Yesterday, during the second incursion of sixty aircraft, twenty-five were shot down, while Soviet and Mongolian aircraft only lost three. This is, of course, much more reliable than the Japanese claims of sixty Soviet and Mongolian aircraft intruding into their territory, with three Japanese aircraft engaging and shooting down six Soviet and Mongolian aircraft in half an hour.

The Japanese Army and Navy have both lost face, and both are trying to respond to Germany. This kind of response carries even more serious international implications. The United States cannot remain outside the situation. President Roosevelt is not only concerned about the Anglo-Soviet-French agreement but is also considering dispatching a fleet to the Far East to stop the invaders' increasingly reckless actions. The difficulties faced by the Japanese aggressors will only continue to increase, as one can imagine.

### National Salvation Movement in Malaya

— Yang Yang

(I) Introduction

Since the end of the First World War, Malaya's industry and commerce have flourished, with most of the economic interests being held entirely in the hands of overseas Chinese. Therefore, overseas Chinese have established a great labor force in the Malayan region.

In terms of the residents of Malaya, in addition to the local Malayans, there are also Indians, with overseas Chinese accounting for more than 1.8 million people. These millions of overseas Chinese, in addition to holding authority in industry and commerce, mostly work as laborers in factories, rubber plantations, and stone mines.

The sound of the bell for the July 7th Resistance War (Second Sino-Japanese War) awakened the entire population of overseas Chinese in Malaya. They thoroughly recognized the meaning of China's resistance war: it was fought to strive for national freedom and liberation, to fight for the critical moment of the motherland's life and death, and to defend the principle of eternal human peace. For these reasons, they abandoned class struggle, applying the strength of class struggle to the united front of all strata, attacking the greatest aggressor in the East. All overseas Chinese were able to uphold the great righteousness of the resistance war, breaking through the divisions of class, sincerely uniting, and implementing labor-management understanding. This is the progressive manifestation of the overseas Chinese under the major premise of the war of resistance.

(II) The Glorious Actions of Miners

During the war of resistance, the motherland needed a large amount of material and human resources. These two conditions were the main factors determining the victory or defeat of the resistance war. The overseas Chinese in Malaya, based on the instructions of the central government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, concentrated human and material resources and mobilized them to the fullest extent, such as the great unity of gangs, the mobilization of technical personnel to return to China to serve, and large-scale donation movements…

Everywhere based on national revolution, everywhere based on a comprehensive and long-term war of resistance, faithfully implementing the government's intentions, cooperating with the front-line war of resistance, with the principle of the rear providing money and labor, never relaxing the 'glorious history of the overseas Chinese as the mother of the revolution'. The wheel of the times is pushing every son and daughter of Greater China, their blood boiling, to save the Greater Chinese nation. Regardless of class, all are actively on the national salvation front.

First, the three thousand Chinese laborers in the Longyun mine had a heroic patriotic action. They were unwilling to produce for the Japanese aggressors, to manufacture weapons to kill their compatriots, and to mine ore to undermine the motherland's resistance forces. They voluntarily went on strike. This glorious action aroused not only the sympathy of overseas Chinese, but also inspired Indians and Malayans. They joined in the strike. And this Longyun mine, which the Japanese had painstakingly managed for more than ten years, could not withstand the blows of the pursuit of peace and justice and had to declare bankruptcy.

These more than three thousand heroic and enthusiastic men, although from different hometowns, including Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Huizhou, and Fuzhou, ultimately shared the same pain of the motherland's subjugation. They originally had more than two dollars in wages per day, but for the sake of the motherland's survival, they were willing to be hungry and to sacrifice their valuable jobs, creating the first voice of overseas opposition to violent aggression, writing a brilliant page in history.

Shortly after the strike, they traveled by boat from Longyun to Singapore. They brought an extremely high tide of patriotism to Singapore, inspiring unlimited sympathy among the compatriots in Singapore—the compatriots in Malaya. When their ship arrived in Singapore, thousands upon thousands of students, workers, businessmen, and overseas Chinese leaders, filled with unlimited enthusiasm, warmly welcomed and consoled them. And those magnificent and luxurious association halls and exquisitely furnished villas had to let these heroes stay. Enthusiastic and respectful college students, elementary school students, women, businessmen, and workers continuously came to offer them flowers, encouragement, and condolences every day—and the relief supplies piled up like mountains. This is not an exaggeration but a manifestation of the fervent emotions of overseas Chinese. This proves that workers fighting for justice receive sympathy everywhere. How can the traitors without conscience not be ashamed to death?

They stayed in Singapore for more than two months. Among them, except for a few who were introduced to jobs by local overseas Chinese in Singapore, the remaining 80% were willing to return to China with lofty aspirations and engage in a desperate battle directly against the violent aggressors.

These miners from Longyun did their utmost for the motherland's war of resistance. They developed a practical sense of national salvation with heroic and glorious actions. In Malaya, they erected the majestic banner of the vanguard of the national salvation movement, leaving a deep impression on every compatriot in Malaya, throughout Southeast Asia, and in all of China.

(III) The Central Task of Overseas Chinese in Malaya During the War of Resistance

A. Boycott of Japanese Goods

Following the influence of the Longyun Chinese workers refusing to produce for the Japanese, it stimulated every compatriot working for the Japanese, and strikes followed one after another like wind and snow. The Japanese mines in places such as Mabao, Zhuzhu, Baxia, Johor, and Xinshan caused one-quarter of the South Seas' mineral production, used by the Japanese to manufacture weapons, to come to a complete halt. A large-scale boycott movement was launched in Singapore, and the news spread and permeated throughout Malaya.

Japanese goods originally occupied a huge market in Malaya. Whether it was a large store or a small shop, or even a foreign firm, they were filled with the inferior traces of Japanese goods. Especially in the manipulation of the Malayan fishing industry, after the July 7th Resistance War began, these businessmen gradually awakened. At the same time, in the vigorous boycott movement, countless patriotic youths engaged in national salvation were active. They gave speeches, performed plays, and sang songs all day long in the streets, alleys, shanties, and bustling areas. Alerting slogans, wall newspapers, and posters covered every corner. At the same time, they also carried out the work of eliminating traitors.

After they investigated the shops selling Japanese goods, they first sent a written warning in the name of [group name]. If the boss ignored it, they took the second step, which was to send [members of organization] with black oil, using the most agile means, to spray the signboard of the traitorous merchant, turning the goods of the entire store into a dark mess. Dozens of traitorous merchants had suffered this kind of experience. There was also a kind of traitorous merchant who was incorrigible, even after being doused in black oil, and still did not repent, so they sacrificed a pair of ears inherited from their parents, shouldering an eternally shameful notoriety, and suffered a beating. There have been twenty or thirty people who have experienced this kind of taste. When these events happened, the crowds were huge, rushing to see the spectacle as if it were a wonderful sight, and everyone expressed their joy and sympathy. Even a three-foot-tall child could spit and curse, 'The traitor has no conscience!'

The doctors in the hospitals also expressed the same sympathy. When they saw a traitorous merchant or a Chinese traitor without ears enter the hospital, whether they were British, Malay, or Chinese, they spat at them disdainfully and cursed:

'Humph, traitor, no conscience!'

They pushed him away, letting him suffer to the point of near death. After finishing other work, they would slowly come and joke with him.

The strong boycott and traitor elimination movement gave a warning to the traitorous merchants, their consciences were awakened, and at the same time, they had to be wary of their own lives. Therefore, Japanese goods suddenly lost their market in Malaya, and the Mitsubishi and Mitsui firms, based on economic aggression, inevitably suffered this strong blow and declared bankruptcy one after another.

Under the vigorous promotion of national salvation members, under the full cooperation of all overseas Chinese, and with the severing of economic ties with Japan, the boycott movement spread rapidly and achieved great results. It severed the millions of dollars of trade Japan engaged in every month in Malaya, which meant cutting off the economic source for Japan to advance southward and invade China, so that Japan had no economic foothold in Malaya.

In order to salvage its own losses, Japan resorted to all kinds of tricks, enticing unscrupulous merchants in [location] to repackage Japanese goods and replace them with 'domestic' brand names, and transport them south for sale, mostly in the form of undershirts, knitted shirts, sweet potatoes, Beijing goods, seafood, medicinal materials, and all kinds of consumer goods. On the other hand, Japan bribed unscrupulous elements in [location] to impersonate social organizations, from which they provided certification as domestic products to deceive overseas Chinese. Such acts of selling one's soul are equivalent to treason and undermine the work of national salvation. However, this conspiracy aroused even greater vigilance among patriotic overseas Chinese, intensified the task of boycotting Japanese goods and eliminating traitors, and made the national salvation movement develop even more extremely.

B. Donation Movement

'Those who have money give money, those who have strength give strength'—this is the responsibility that every Chinese son and daughter should bear during the war of resistance. And the overseas Chinese in Malaya more earnestly shoulder this mission. In addition to purchasing 15 million yuan of public bonds (according to the original quota allocated by the Ministry of Finance, Malaya was 10 million yuan, but the result exceeded 5 million) and more than 2 million yuan in monthly donations, there were also continuous special donations, one day's salary, hawkers, coffee shops, speculators, taverns donating the entire revenue of one day, reporting to support relief. As for students, they promoted a one-cent-a-day donation movement. At the Great World amusement park in Singapore, charity sales were held every Saturday and Sunday evenings to aid refugee children. The Happy World and New World amusement parks also reported for three days every two months, donating all the money they earned to the motherland, with each performance amounting to about 100,000 to 50,000 yuan (national currency).

When encountering festivals or commemorative days, streets and alleys were filled with alerting slogans, cartoons, and declarations. Majestic songs were sent everywhere. Touching dramas were rehearsed in the shanties (rural areas) and on the roads. Teams of young students and workers, holding bouquets of blood flowers, national salvation flowers, and national humiliation flowers, were urging pedestrians, shops, factories, and residents to buy them. Each time, about eight or nine hundred teams were mobilized, with about ten or eight people in each team. They were actively creating a world of flowers under the strong sunlight, covering the entire city. Each time the results were always about 300,000 to 500,000 yuan in national currency.

The donation movement spread throughout Malaya. Every Chinese person could contribute as much money as possible to consolidate the strength of the war of resistance. Especially among the working class, the emotions were even higher. Since the start of the war of resistance until now, everyone has donated at least thirty or forty Malayan dollars. The friendly countries who uphold justice and love world peace all expressed their sympathy. They (such as the British in foreign firms, the Indians in factories, and the Malays in rubber plantations) automatically donated generously during each flower sale fundraiser, with great enthusiasm.

(IV) Organizational Forms of the National Salvation Movement in Malaya

In the eyes of the Japanese, an unorganized China is truly vulnerable in battle. However, the sacred war of resistance began and organized the scattered Chinese people as a whole. Whether in politics, military affairs, people's movement, or on the front lines or in the rear, there are strong organizations. Especially the overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Siam, Annam, and Malaya, more unanimously and strongly organized the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief General Association, forming the general engine of the national salvation movement, effectively supporting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in resisting to the end.

In Malaya, in addition to the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief General Association, there are also many national salvation groups with broad mass support, such as the Malayan All Circles Anti-Japanese Support Association, which has more than 200,000 supporters. The next is the Chinese National Liberation Vanguard, which has thousands of brave and capable youths. There is also the heroic and enthusiastic Chinese Children's Vanguard, which is very active on the national salvation front, using fearless spirit to organize the masses, lead the masses, and develop all kinds of national salvation work.

Although these organizations are secret, their stance is open and aboveboard, everywhere based on Sino-British amity, strictly adhering to local discipline. If some immaturity is revealed in the various actions of eliminating traitors, boycotting goods, and countering espionage, the authorities are also understanding, so they receive unlimited sympathy from international pacifists.

(V) The Japanese Conspiracy in Malaya

Since the failure of [ideology] in Malaya, the local government felt the threat of Japanese southward advance. The Japanese conspiracy to advance southward was desperately spreading, and counterespionage work was urgent. Under common interests and common goals, the overseas Chinese's national salvation and boycott movement greatly assisted the Malayan government.

In its conspiracy in Malaya, Japan organized the so-called Southern Advancement Society, led by a certain newspaper in Singapore (run by Japanese), using huge sums of money to trade in traitors and ruffians, and organizing groups such as the San [group name], [group name] National Salvation [group name], commando teams, and purchasing local ruffian secret societies—(the San [group name] Party, the purpose of which is to collect fees from hawkers)—to sabotage the developing national salvation organizations. The assassination of Mr. Xiong Fangping, an enthusiastic national salvation member, on May 4 this year, aroused even greater hatred of Japanese bandits among all overseas Chinese. In addition to using shameless traitors, Japan also used gang conflicts to undermine relief and split unity and solidarity. As said above, although the role of gangs still existed after the war of resistance, in the premise of saving the motherland, Japan had no way to use it. As for [group name], originally an illegal organization of general ruffians, it has fundamentally lost its sense of time, and in addition to suppressing hawkers, its own bandits killed and fought each other, disrupting local order. The authorities should eliminate such organizations in various ways. Moreover, under the resistance of several powerful national salvation groups, they can no longer exist.

(VI) Great Manifestations

Since the war of resistance, several unprecedented mass rallies have been held in Singapore. In these rallies, the fervent and high-spirited emotions all demonstrated the motherland's rebirth.

On July 7 last year, two to three thousand people held a mass rally at the Happy World amusement park to commemorate the July 7th War of Resistance and National Construction, led by Mr. Chen Jiageng, chairman of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief General Association. At that time, the solemn speeches, tragic songs, and majestic slogans moved the hearts of several heated individuals.

On May 1 this year, another mass rally for spiritual mobilization was held, also led by Mr. Chen Jiageng. The situation was as enthusiastic as on July 7.

Much success was achieved in these rallies, such as breaking gang concepts, labor-management cooperation, and supporting the central government's resistance to the end, making everyone more deeply understand the reality, understand the tasks they bear, and promote greater unity among the masses.

Listen! The four hundred million masses sing.

Freedom, equality, liberation—

From now on, just like the roar they made in the meeting, their hearts are linked together, and they will continue to fight and work hard for freedom, equality, and liberation.

In the twenty-three months since the war of resistance, the overseas Chinese in Malaya, whether in urban or rural areas, from capitalists to peddlers and porters, every overseas Chinese has embodied the spirit of cooperating with the central government's war of resistance and has established the glory of overseas Chinese.

Now the war of resistance is approaching its second anniversary, and the glorious battle continues to develop. May all of our 450 million compatriots, based on the spirit of past struggles, unite as one, overcome all hardships, and drive the cruel Japanese aggressors out of our land and build a free and peaceful new China.

### The Situation in Guangdong Becomes More Intense: Our Troops in the Chao-Shan Area Move to New Positions; Enemy Attempting to Land at Yuhuan Repelled

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 28th] The enemy's actions in the southeastern coastal areas are clearly aimed at strengthening the blockade and threatening Britain, America, and other nations. Based on estimates of the enemy's troop strength, it is highly unlikely that they will invade our interior from Wenzhou, Fuzhou, or Ningbo. The focus of the war remains in Shanxi Province, where we have shifted from a passive to an active stance, inflicting a fatal blow on the enemy forces attacking south of the Zhongtiao Mountains. The enemy's losses cannot be replenished in the short term. Fierce battles are ongoing in southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu. There have been only minor skirmishes in Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei. The war in eastern Guangdong is expanding, with Chao'an abandoned and Jieyang remaining secure.

Our Troops Withdraw from Chao'an: A Commander Discusses the Battle Situation

[Continental News Agency, Urgent Dispatch from Xingning] On the 26th, our forces and the enemy were still engaged in fierce fighting near Fuyang. Four enemy aircraft detachments attacked various stations on the northern section of the Chao-Shan Railway, resulting in heavy bombing of Fengxi and Yangwu. On the 27th, the enemy used infantry and aircraft to press on the Fuyang line, while over a thousand cavalrymen advanced along two routes: one along the levee highway and the other along the railway, crossing Fengxi. At 9:00 AM, they launched a fierce attack on Chao'an city. Our defending troops engaged in battle, and fierce fighting continued until 3:00 PM. Due to heavy casualties, we reluctantly withdrew, although a portion of our forces remained in Chao'an city, fighting to the death and sacrificing themselves completely. Chao'an then fell. Our troops near Fuyang, due to the terrain, withdrew to mountainous areas northeast of Fengxi. Reinforcements from Jieyang's Xichang continue to increase.

[Central News Agency, Liuhuang, 27th] A Central News Agency reporter rushed to a certain location on the 24th to meet with a certain commander. Arriving at midnight, guided by faint starlight, he entered the heavily guarded camp. The commander was speaking with front-line unit commanders, pointing out strategies on a map. Upon seeing the reporter, he nodded and offered a seat, displaying a spirited and composed demeanor. He discussed the battle situation with the reporter, stating that the enemy, facing dwindling troop resources and war-weary people, was attempting to divert public attention with new provocations. The terrain of Chao-Shan, being flat and close to the sea, had no military value. After extracting a price, our troops would shift their positions according to the Second Phase of the War of Resistance strategy and continue to engage the enemy. The commander also mentioned that the attacking forces on Shantou were estimated to be about two regiments, mainly from the 106th Division, mixed with some puppet troops and naval landing forces. Their morale was exceptionally low, while our side's morale was high, and the people were enthusiastic. If the enemy ventured deep, they would suffer heavy losses. As he spoke, heavy artillery fire could be heard outside the window, and the telephone rang incessantly. The reporter then took his leave. On the way back, the moonlight was hazy, and he felt greatly excited. The accompanying adjutant recounted the withdrawal from Shantou, saying that on the 23rd, dozens of enemy aircraft flew in shifts to bomb the area. Our troops defending Shantou remained calm and unmoved. The enemy then landed at the Chaoyang and Taikoo docks, encountering attacks from our troops along the way, resulting in heavy casualties. The enemy troops became enraged and indiscriminately shot and killed people in retaliation, causing numerous civilian casualties, and looting all property. Our troops fought and retreated, making heroic sacrifices. Buildings in the city were set ablaze, with smoke billowing everywhere. Shantou was practically in ruins. Although Shantou has fallen, what has the enemy gained? They will only realize that they have stepped into a quagmire and will regret it later.

More Enemy Warships in the Fujian Sea; Capture of Chuanshi Island Insignificant

[Reuters, Chongqing, 28th] It is reported that eighteen Japanese warships, including cruisers, destroyers, and transport ships, are now anchored outside Fuzhou harbor. It is widely believed that a Japanese landing in Fuzhou is imminent. The Chinese side has long anticipated this, so all agencies have moved inland.

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 27th] Yesterday, eight or nine enemy warships arrived off the Minjiang estuary and Mawei Bay. At 6:10 AM this morning, they attacked our outer blockade line. Enemy warships simultaneously opened fire, bombarding our coast for an hour and a half. Several enemy aircraft also took off to assist. At 6:00 AM, the artillery fire suddenly stopped, and four enemy boats, carrying about a hundred soldiers, patrolled near our blockade line. Nine enemy aircraft then took off from a giant aircraft carrier, flying over Lianjiang, Guantou, Mawei, and Changle along the coast, and dropping bombs in Changmen. Our defending troops faced them calmly. When the enemy warships fired, we also returned fire, creating a sky filled with artillery fire and a fierce battle. At the same time, several other enemy warships took the opportunity to approach Chuanshi Island (erroneously reported as Bifeng Island yesterday) outside the estuary and forcibly landed several hundred soldiers. The island is isolated in the sea, and we had not set up defenses there, leading to its capture by the enemy.

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 27th] Chuanshi Island, outside the Minjiang estuary, is located northeast of the Minjiang estuary, isolated in the sea, and situated on the current blockade line. It is about seven nautical miles from Changmen on the mainland coast, and is one of several islands outside the estuary. It is no more than one kilometer long, and the entire island is a rocky hill. The telegraph station of the Northern Telegraph Company's submarine cable is located there, and it is a necessary route for the three Fujian sea routes. Foreigners residing in Fuzhou have built several villas there, and often go there for summer holidays. We only have a small number of fishermen living there. Since the start of the war, the Minjiang waterway has been locked down, and foreign merchant ships that can navigate to Fuzhou use this island as an anchorage to load and unload passengers and goods, which are then transported by steamship. Therefore, it is of great importance to the commercial and shipping interests of various countries. The enemy's sudden occupation is clearly aimed at implementing a complete blockade to strike at the interests of third countries. This is the same as blockading Tianjin and invading Shantou and Dinghai. Its military significance to us is insignificant.

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 28th] Eight enemy boats gathered outside the Minjiang estuary. Six of them left at 11:00 AM this morning, and eight more arrived at 4:00 PM this afternoon, including an aircraft carrier carrying 21 enemy aircraft. Four enemy warships also arrived off the Qinghai coast south of the Minjiang estuary. There are now a total of fourteen enemy warships. Enemy aircraft took turns taking off yesterday and today, attacking the Minjiang estuary area, dropping hundreds of bombs in Changmen, Meihua, Wulongjiang, Luozhou Township, Hongshan Bridge, and Baisha Township. All areas are under air attack day and night.

[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 27th] The enemy who landed at Cimen, Yuhuan on the morning of the 26th was annihilated by more than half. The remaining enemy fled back to the cages. On the morning of the 27th, six more enemy warships and more than ten motorboats were added near Kanmen, patrolling back and forth, and two enemy aircraft were circling, seemingly attempting to land again. We are on high alert.

Lu-Su Adopts New Strategies; Enemy's "Mopping-Up" Plan Fails

[Our Chongqing Special Dispatch, 28th] Shandong and Jiangsu are launching new strategies. In recent days, they have launched separate attacks on the enemy in various places. In southeastern Shandong, we rely on mountainous terrain, either defending or attacking, exhausting the enemy. Along the Jiaoji and Jinpu railways, we constantly attack each other, achieving small victories repeatedly.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 26th] According to the spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission, the enemy attempted to "mop up" our southern Shandong troops with two divisions, but we had long seen through their trick and had made full preparations and were in a favorable terrain. Although the enemy invaded in multiple directions at the beginning of this month, they were limited by the terrain, and their mechanized units were unable to maneuver. Our army used flexible tactics to launch a head-on blow, sometimes circling with them to lure them deep into the mountains, and then attacking from all sides, annihilating many. The enemy, suffering such heavy losses, had no other choice but to resort to their old tricks and vigorously promote their fabricated victories. On the 25th, the enemy's broadcast even claimed that Yu Xuezhong and Shen Honglie had been removed from their positions as commander-in-chief of the Jiangsu-Shandong War Zone and chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government due to the war zone. This absurd propaganda, created out of nothing, is not even worth a smile to those in the know. We have never established a Jiangsu-Shandong War Zone, as the world knows. Secondly, they also claimed that our army was subject to reorganization of miscellaneous troops due to the failure in Shandong, which is even more untenable. Since the War of Resistance, our army has been unified in organization, with no distinction between each other, which proves that their tricks of sowing discord have been exhausted. Their so-called self-deception only shows that their efforts are in vain.

### Night Attack on Junshan: Re-Captured Again

[Central News Agency, Miluo, 27th] On the night of the 23rd, our capable troops, riding many warships, braved the wind and waves and launched a night attack on Junshan, a mountain as green as a screen in Dongting Lake. The enemy entrenched on the mountain were alarmed and mostly lacked the will to fight. The enemy took advantage of the darkness to scramble onto motorboats docked at the foot of the mountain and fled towards Yueyang. On the morning of the 24th, our troops completely cleared the remaining enemy in the mountains, and Junshan was recaptured (Junshan was once recaptured by us in the spring of this year). Our troops are now comforting the survivors in the mountains and have deployed a tight search and alert around Yueyang. On the morning of the 26th, enemy boats launched two counterattacks on the eastern part of the mountain, but were repelled by us.

### Hunan Gentry Cai Ren'er Orders His Son to Enlist; Chairman Chiang Commends Him

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Chairman Chiang recently received a telegram from Zhang Zhongning, the magistrate of Huitong County in southern Hunan, stating that Mr. Cai Ren'er, a local gentry, was deeply moved after reading Chairman Chiang's letter to the gentry of the country. Cai has a son named Zongbi, who graduated from high school and was exempt from military service. Cai specifically ordered him to enlist and to first go to the countryside to promote enlistment. At one point, more than seventy young men followed him into the army. Chairman Chiang was deeply gratified and sent a telegram to the magistrate commending him as an example.

### Sichuan Provincial Assembly Established on July 1st

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 28th] The Sichuan Provincial Provisional Assembly is scheduled to be established on July 1st. Forty members have already reported.

### County Magistrate's Ineffective Suppression of Opium; Dismissed and Investigated; Political Order on Track in Sichuan Province

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 28th] Xiao Lizhen, the magistrate of Pengshan County, has been dismissed for ineffective suppression of opium. He is currently in Chongqing. Wang Zanxu has telegraphed He Guoguang, requesting him to send personnel to Chengdu for interrogation.

### Chongqing Cultural Circles Send Telegram to Encourage the Mongolian League

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] More than 30 cultural organizations, including the Central Weekly Society, telegraphed the Mongolian League, praising their resistance against Japan and expressing the hope that they would strive to kill the enemy and establish close contact with the war situation in the Central Plains.

### Various Armies in Southern Shanxi Charge Forward Victoriously; Recapture Yuanqu and Gaoluo, Killing 1,600 Enemies; Tragic Battle Comparable to the Battle of Xinkou

[Our Xi'an Special Dispatch, 27th] We welcomed the recovery of Yuanqu in southern Shanxi on the evening of the 4th. After several days of mopping up the remaining enemies, it was completely cleared on the 27th. About six thousand enemy soldiers were killed. A certain unit of our guerrillas attacked near Jiang County. Fierce fighting continued on the Black River bank. Gaoluo has been recaptured.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 27th] The enemy who attacked the Zhongtiao Mountains for the seventh time generally expected to succeed, but the good news from the front line on the 26th has proven them wrong. Yuanqu was recovered by us on the 25th, and the enemy's utter defeat was predicted by our military authorities. The following is a brief account of the glorious battle. The enemy, with the aim of "sweeping away" our troops and shaking the Zhongtiao Mountains guerrilla base, launched the seventh attack on the Zhongtiao Mountains from Xia County, Wenxi, Hengling Pass, and east of Jiang County on the 20th. In order to explore the enemy's true intentions and allow the enemy to penetrate deeper, our army pre-emptively deployed the main enemy force to the pre-arranged favorable area. On the 22nd and 23rd, although the enemy's offensive was fierce, our losses were minimal. When our army abandoned Yuanqu to Gaoluo and the Xia County to Gaoluo road and withdrew to both sides, the enemy had fallen into our encirclement. The newly deployed of our forces completed our strategic position, and a full-scale counter-offensive was launched. A certain high-ranking officer personally supervised the battle on the front line. The morale was high, and everyone had the spirit of one against a hundred, charging towards the enemy. Especially in Majiamiao, Wangshan (southeast of Wenxi), Yanjiashan (south of Hengling Pass), and Wangmaozhen and Chencun (north of Yuanqu), the battle was even more fierce. The situation of loyalty, courage and tragedy was comparable to the Battle of Xinkou. As a result of the all-day battle, corpses littered the fields and the ravines were blocked. By the night of the 24th, the enemy was unable to hold on and showed signs of wavering. On the 25th, the enemy fled in multiple directions, with three thousand fleeing to Xia County, more than three thousand fleeing to Wenxi, and the main force fleeing to the north of Gaoluo. The situation was extremely chaotic. Our army pursued and attacked, and completely resolved the surrounded enemy. Yuanqu was recaptured. According to a telegram from the front, our pursuit forces have advanced to Shangnan, Si, and Laowugou West in the southwest of Gaoluo and south of Yuanqu. It is estimated that the enemy casualties in Gaoluo were about 5,000. It was found that the enemy was still the 20th Division and the newly added unit. The wounds from the defeat in Pinglu had not yet healed, and they suffered another blow, which was indeed tragic.

[Central News Agency, Luoyang, 28th] After suffering heavy losses in Yuanqu, the enemy retreated to Gaoluo Hengdian Pass and was fiercely attacked by our various units. We have advanced into the area between Majiashan, Yanjiashan, Liulinli, Gaoluo, and Hengling Pass. Our two divisions are chasing and killing them in a devastating manner, with corpses littering the roads. The remaining enemy fled north in panic, covered by the artillery fire of Hengling Pass. A lot of military supplies were captured and are being inventoried.

### Two慰问团: Southern Group Has Arrived in Nanning; Northern Group Has Arrived in Chengdu

### U.S. State Department Refuses to Withdraw僑民from Fuzhou and Wenzhou; Enemy Navy霸佔Southeastern Coast

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] The U.S. State Department issued a statement today stating that it is difficult to accept the Japanese request that foreign僑民 and ships withdraw from Fuzhou and Wenzhou. If the lives and property of American僑民 in those two places are endangered by Japanese military action, the responsibility should be borne by the Japanese side.

[Central News Agency, Chong, 28th] Shanghai Foreign, Regarding the Japanese ultimatum for the withdrawal of American warships from Fuzhou and Wenzhou, Earl, Commander of the American Fleet in Asia, has drafted a reply refusing. As for the withdrawal of American僑民, Gauss, the American Consul General in Shanghai, has recently also refused. It is said that American僑民 have the right to freely enter and reside in treaty ports, and if the safety of僑民's lives and property is harmed as a result, the responsibility must be borne by the Japanese side. It is also revealed that Commander Earl stated in his reply that American warships have the freedom to navigate the coast of China in order to protect the lives and property of American僑民.

Fuzhou

Some British僑民 Withdraw; British Warships Sail to Fujian to Protect僑民

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Shanghai News, The British gunboat Dragonfly and 炸号 have arrived in Shanghai from the British Channel. It is heard that they will patrol the Minjiang River.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Overseas news from Shanghai, The number of British僑民 withdrawn from Fuzhou yesterday is about ten, and it has not yet been ascertained. All Britishers first go to Chuanshi, and then board the British warship "Courage" there. When Japanese troops landed on Chuanshi Island, all the British僑民 on the island had already boarded the ship. The Japanese naval authorities have recently notified foreign僑民 of all countries that anyone wishing to withdraw must go to Chuanshi Island before tonight, so that they can board a ship from there and leave Fujian. Last night, the British侨民团体 in Fuzhou held a meeting to discuss this matter. The British Consul advocated at the meeting that children should be evacuated, but so far, the number of evacuees is still unconfirmed. Officers of the warship "Courage" escorted British侨民 who were determined to withdraw to Chuanshi yesterday afternoon. The British Ambassador to China has advised the British Consul in Fuzhou not to order British侨民 to evacuate unless absolutely necessary in the face of harm. It is said that this is the current British policy, because the British government believes that once British侨民 withdraw from cities occupied by the Japanese army, it will be extremely difficult to return to their original locations.

Wenzhou

All Foreign Ships Withdraw; Only Six British僑民 Remain

[Central News Agency, 28th] Overseas news from Shanghai, The wireless radio report from the British ship currently anchored in Wenzhou states that all foreign ships currently anchored in Wenzhou are scheduled to withdraw this afternoon. However, among the 28 foreigners in Wenzhou, 6 British僑民 have decided not to withdraw.

Shantou

Japan Still Refuses航; Forcibly佔 American Docks

[Chung News, 电28th] Overseas news from Shantou, The British request for British ships to freely enter and exit Shantou has been rejected by Matsukata, the Japanese领事 in Shantou. It is said that in order to maintain local security, ships of any country are currently unable to sail into Shantou. At the same time, Matsukata reminded the British of the "unfriendly expression towards Japanese military actions" by the British side in southern China. It is heard that the British naval authorities still strongly advocate that British ships should be allowed to freely navigate to Shantou, and if the Japanese side prevents the entry of British ships, the British Navy will dispatch warships to escort them. There are still two British merchant ships anchored outside the port of Shantou, and the British warship is scheduled to escort the two ships into the port today.

### Yang Sen and His Officers and Soldiers Telegram He Yingqin; Supporting the National Policy of Resistance and Denouncing Wang's Treachery; Rumor that Wang is Going to Ping to Discuss the Formation of a Puppet Government

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Yang Sen, Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the × Corps, led all officers and soldiers in telegraphed Minister He of the Ministry of Military Administration on the 20th, supporting the established national policy of the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the supreme leader, eradicating traitors domestically and resisting the invaders externally. They stated that Wang 역 조명's puppet act was a treasonous betrayal, and that if this villain was not eliminated, the country would not be safe.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Overseas Chinese groups in Coho, Canada, and Spokane, Washington, USA, telegraphed Chairman Chiang, expressing unanimous condemnation of Wang Zhaoming's treasonous behavior.

[Reuters, Beiping, 28th] It is reported that the Japanese are now preparing to issue a declaration on the anniversary of the July 7th Incident, organizing a puppet Chinese Federal Government. According to well-informed sources in Chinese political circles, Wang Jingwei flew from Shanghai to Tianjin yesterday, and then went to Beiping to discuss matters with Wang Kemin, Wu Peifu, and representatives of the Nanjing puppet government.

(Central News Agency, Chong, 28th) Warm News (1) Wang Kemin sent He Qi, Miao Bin, and Shi Lian to Shanghai to discuss the formation of a puppet central government with Liang Hongzhi, Chen Qun, and Wang Jingwei.

### The Fall of Shantou (3)

— Special Article by This Newspaper, Lin Gao

Eyewitness Account of the Japanese Plundering of Shantou

A few minutes later, he and two coolies, grabbing each other, took off their green coat, wrapped in white cloth, flashed out of the alley, and passed in front of the Taikoo Foreign Company. The wheels were close to each other, and the light waves, and the sweeping sound of gunfire attracted even more people to the stern of the Yingzhou, even though the place where the bullets were flying was only two or three hundred meters away, and the enthusiasm was almost about to fly out.

The people of Chao-Shan will assist the army in combat.

After the gunfire stopped, the flight and bombing of the aircraft resumed. The records were unbroken since the beginning, and often flew over the wheel.

Five

The staff of the Taikoo Foreign Company on the Yingzhou Wheel all wore armbands. People without armbands were called off the ship. Because of that relative, I also wore its armband and was not expelled ashore. The people who went ashore all bowed their heads. Being able to escape the bombs and machine gun bullets of the planes could save their lives, otherwise, they could only sit and wait for the cruel and brutal treatment of the Japanese.

Every time the Japanese motorboat approached the side of the wheel, people's hearts pounded. The Japanese were cowardly and dared not fight, and were even more afraid of fighting hand-to-hand with our army, but they were more brutal than others when dealing with unarmed civilians.

An armored motorboat, viewed from the front, was shaped like a tank. Close to the drawbridge, several Japanese soldiers boarded the ship, with their pointed hats, rough faces, fierce eyes, and vulgar Jintan beards. One looked like a chieftain.

Inspection, search, plunder, injection of poison, massacre... a series of impressions of the Japanese brutality turned in everyone's minds. Sweat was flowing from their foreheads, and they were 着 on the deck with their hands behind their backs.

After a while, the hanging ladder rang out with a peeling sound, and the Japanese soldiers got off the boat. An employee of the ship said that he and the captain were discussing disembarking from the dock on this ship, but the captain did not agree to him. Bah! The cowardly Japanese army wanted to attack our army under the cover of the British flag!

The Yingzhou Wheel did not intend to set sail, and the Japanese planes continued to fly in the city air, bombing and strafing. The situation on the shore was unknown, and not far from the Yingzhou Wheel, there was also a Guangsheng Wheel (this wheel is called Xilong in Hong Kong newspapers, and Kunming and Shantou are called Guangsheng). The wheel was hanging with blue and black "Touwu" and blue and yellow "結關" flags, and it was still possible to sail. My relatives borrowed a small electric boat from a British foreign company, and dozens of people boarded the Guangsheng Wheel together. There were already several people on the wheel before. This wheel was right outside the Zhaoshangju wharf on the water drum, not close to the wharf. Except for small electric boats with foreign flags, small wooden boats had to pass through the patrol of the Japanese army's small motorboats before they could be驳. Because the Japanese planes bombed in the city air all day long, it was very dangerous to get close to the coast, so very few people boarded the船. (To be continued)

### On the Night Train to Baoji

— Special Correspondent Geng Ya

Today, Xi'an, in the cause of total resistance against Japan, though suffering some linear losses in the early stages, has become a rare ancient capital. During a short separation on the way to Tongguan and northern Shaanxi, although enemy planes do not frequently "patronize" it, its special circumstances mean it still retains its former charm: the city walls stand tall and complete against the clouds, and the citizens calmly lead their wartime lives. Especially when the streetlights are first lit and the evening breeze is cool, many commercial centers and entertainment venues are as prosperous as Nanjing's Xinjiekou and Beijing's East and West Chang'an Streets before the war. Xi'an City is forty li in circumference, with many abandoned houses, open spaces, and civilian shops, mostly single-story bungalows. The population is approximately XX tens of thousands, with about half having been evacuated. Moreover, the city uses the strong and solid loess of the Northwest, digging deep and secure air-raid shelters in all streets and alleys. Upon hearing the wailing alarm, people can hide without a trace in an instant. When enemy planes "patronize" the city, they find a vast and empty space, and even though they indiscriminately drop bombs, casualties and losses are minimal (one time, casualties were as high as five or six hundred, because after three previous alarms, no bombers were seen. When the fourth alarm sounded, it was dinnertime for many women, who were unable to seek shelter in time, so most of the casualties were women).

If you can take advantage of the opportunity to avoid air raids to venture outside the city to the suburbs, and see the refugees coming from the east, helping local farmers to work hard in production, and their attitude of mutual love, and then take a glimpse of the modern grand buildings covering thousands of acres in other counties, and the "preparedness averts peril" national defense works, you will surely realize the profound truth of Chairman Chiang's declaration of the "second phase of the War of Resistance, turning weakness into strength, turning defense into offense." At the same time, it can also help you understand a historical tale that has been passed down through the ages: when the Yan general Yue Yi attacked Qi, he was able to capture more than seventy cities in one night, but why couldn't he capture Wan and Jimo in three years, and ultimately suffered an irreversible defeat in the counterattack by Tian Dan? Moreover, the Guanzhong region has been known for its strategic importance since ancient times, with mountains and rivers forming a natural barrier, and occupying high ground to build defenses. Advancing, it can plan to recover lost territories, and retreating, it can provide rest and recuperation. It is truly a place of strategic importance. Especially since the Yellow Emperor founded the country, the Zhou, Qin, Han, Tang, and other seven dynasties all took Chang'an (Xi'an) as their capital. Whether in military prowess or culture, it has been able to develop and reach its peak here. Today's Xi'an, possessing the glorious history and superior geographical heritage of thousands of years, is also nurturing countless anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians with a spirit of swallowing mountains and rivers and the loyalty of dogs. It is not difficult for us to imagine what a prominent role she will play in this national liberation war.

——With such a feeling, the reporter reluctantly said goodbye to Xi'an and headed west to Baoji, preparing to go south.

Honorable Soldiers and Pilgrims

It was an express night train departing from Xi'an to the west. It left at around ten o'clock in the evening and arrived in Baoji at six or seven o'clock the next morning. The scene was quite similar to the express night trains between Beijing and Shanghai before the war.

The train came from Henan Province. Among the crowded passengers were many armed comrades: their heroic spirit and smiling faces fully demonstrated their firm inner aspirations. They were all running towards the same direction. With humorous smiles, they warmly greeted the passengers who had just squeezed onto the train with "a charge," asking about the air raid situation in Xi'an that day. The newly arrived passengers, panting, expressed their admiration for their achievements in fighting the enemy on the front lines. The new passengers offered ten cigarettes, and the soldiers returned the favor with cups of tea… The harmonious relationship between the military and the people was something never seen on the Beijing-Shanghai trains before. Now, on the trains under the control of the Japanese, where "I suspect you are a robber, and you suspect I am an assassin," such a good phenomenon is absolutely impossible.

Through the introduction of a "fellow villager," the Quartermaster Officer XX of the XX Division and Battalion Commander Zheng Runan of the Xinhe Battalion talked with me almost all night. Commander Zheng had just been wounded and returned from Zhongtiao Mountain. He told me about some moving battles in southern Shanxi and pointed out the key to the gradual victory in the Shanxi war situation. He said:

First, it was due to the strictness of Generalissimo Chiang's military orders. When Taiyuan fell, the morale of the army suddenly wavered, and various units retreated one after another, only asking about the location of the Yellow River ferry. Later, they received Generalissimo's order that "all troops in Shanxi must not cross the river," which stabilized the front lines and also established the base for today's counterattack.

Second, it was due to the close cooperation of the various units. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, some units did not understand the seriousness, reality, and positivity of this national liberation war. They feared a compromise midway and secretly harbored the idea of preserving their strength, resulting in ineffective combat. They were also very indifferent to the contact with friendly forces on various fronts. When the Japanese attacked A, B could watch from the sidelines. After A was defeated and the Japanese attacked B, C remained indifferent as before. The Japanese were able to calmly transfer troops and carry out piecemeal attacks against us. Not long after, we thoroughly realized the meaning of resisting to the end and made the painful decision to have "me or the Japanese." Especially from the experience gained in past battles, we deeply understood the value of close coordination among various fronts. If the Japanese attacked Shen, B would immediately attack its flanks, and C would launch a surprise attack to cut off its rear, to achieve the effect of "striking the head and the tail responding." The Japanese tricks were no longer effective, and the situation in Shanxi gradually improved.

Third, it was due to the thorough awakening of the people of Shanxi. In the past, some of the people in Shanxi did not understand that this war of resistance against Japan was related to the life and death of the country, and that all our compatriots had a positive duty to participate. In addition, the Japanese used insidious means to lure and fool the people in various ways, such as distributing several pounds of flour per person to the people in important strongholds in XX County as comfort, two yuan of "military currency," and recruiting the Red Spear Society to reorganize the "Black Army" to help the Japanese "overthrow" the so-called "White Army" and "Red Army" (both referring to the National Army, which was the Japanese's divisive strategy). The Japanese sentries even pretended to salute these "four-not-like" Black Armies as they swayed past. The ignorant villagers believed that the "Black Army" was all-powerful and joined them one after another, acting as accomplices. Later, after our army launched a large-scale counterattack and won victory after victory, the Japanese saw that their defeat was inevitable and revealed their ferocious faces, first extensively searching the women and seizing legal tender from all the people who had submitted, and then massacring seventy or eighty thousand men, women, and children before fleeing in a panic. As a result, the stench of corpses filled the air everywhere, and rubble covered the ground, making it impossible for our victorious army to camp. The tragedy was so severe that there were no appropriate words to describe it. However, when things reach an extreme, they are bound to reverse. After this massacre in XX County, Shanxi, most of the people in the surrounding counties and even the entire province thoroughly awakened and truly united with the National Army, sharing life and death, advancement and retreat. Therefore, the formation of today's strong and broad front in Shanxi, and the people's automatic participation in the war, has had a great effect.

Just as Commander Zheng finished speaking, the train arrived at a new station, where a large group of old women, who had been waiting for a long time, all dressed in blue and with bound feet, carrying yellow bags on their shoulders and holding wooden sticks in their hands, squeezed onto the train one after another and sat down on the floor. I had seen a "Old Women's Troupe" in northern Shaanxi and thought they might be a "Old Women's Rescue Team." After inquiring, I learned that they were pilgrims going to a temple in Baoji where Zhang Sanfeng practiced Taoism to attend a temple fair.

Modern civilization is scientific civilization. It is the father of industry and also the son of industry. The Longhai Railway, one of the giants of industrial civilization, has extended its claws and teeth, raised its head and roared, and stretched to Baoji due to the turbulence of the War of Resistance. However, the fairy dreams of most people there, dominated by theocracy and superstition, have not yet been awakened. This group of pilgrims who do not hesitate to brave the stars and moon and endure the hardships of travel is one example. It would be best for political workers to persuade them at the station, at various traffic intersections, and in front of the temple fairs, to donate the money for buying train tickets and incense candles to comfort the soldiers, and to have them each make a pair of cloth shoes on the spot during the time of offering incense, accumulating little by little, the amount would definitely be considerable. Also, each one can be issued a guarantee when the merit is completed. This is truly an effective way to transcend oneself and benefit future generations.

In the hazy morning mist, we suddenly saw lights shining brightly, like stars twinkling. Then, everyone prepared to get off the train—we had arrived in Baoji.

### Tianjin Incident: Both Sides Compromise; Japan Makes Outrageous Demands; Rumors of Possible Concessions by Britain

[Reuters, London, 27th] According to Reuters sources, there is now sufficient reason to believe that within the last 24 hours, London and Tokyo will announce that Tokyo has begun negotiations on the Tianjin issue.

[Reuters, London, 27th] Regarding the possibility of Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin incident, Reuters learned from well-informed sources that Japan has made two demands: (1) Tianjin should not be allowed to be used as a base for anti-Japanese activities by the Chinese; (2) it should also not be used as a base for assisting the Chinese currency system to counter Japan's "new currency system." It is reported that the British government cannot accept the second demand, but the negotiations between the two sides will start with general issues.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Tokyo Dispatch: This morning, a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry told reporters that the announcement regarding the commencement of Anglo-Japanese negotiations will be issued simultaneously in London and Tokyo today, but the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin will not be lifted during the negotiation period. As for the future of the blockade incident, it depends on the response of the local authorities, he said. The British Consul in Tianjin, Herbert, will come to Japan from Tianjin to participate in the meeting.

[Central News Agency, Junqing, 28th] Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese government plans to issue a public statement today, stating that the Tianjin incident will be resolved through diplomatic negotiations between Britain and Japan. The consular personnel and military representatives of both sides in Tianjin will go to participate in the negotiations. The negotiations will be presided over by the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie. The two sides may begin negotiations next week. British Consul-General in Tianjin, Jamieson, may not go to Tokyo to participate in the negotiations. Regarding the British proposal to resolve the Tianjin issue through negotiations between the two sides, the Japanese side has not yet responded. The public statement issued by the Japanese government today can be regarded as the Japanese side's response. "Asahi Shimbun" stated today that the Japanese government believes that the British government has expressed its willingness to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Tianjin issue, so Foreign Minister Arita also agreed to hold negotiations between the two sides.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 28th] The British government has instructed its ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, to express to the Japanese government that the Tianjin incident should be negotiated directly in Tokyo in order to find a solution. Political figures here expressed their opinions on this matter, saying that the British government is prepared to make considerable concessions to Japan, as the British government believes that, in any case, the scope of conflict should not be expanded in the Far East. It is also heard that the British government intends to hand over the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Geng case to the Tianjin puppet organization and is prepared to cooperate with the Japanese to crack down on "terrorists" in the concession. However, before making the above concessions, Japan should immediately remove the obstacles blocking the British Concession and at least temporarily not raise political demands.

[Central News Agency, London, 26th] Prime Minister Chamberlain made a statement in the House of Commons today, saying that a friendly solution to the Tianjin incident is expected. Members of Parliament were surprised to hear this and asked what the Prime Minister's basis was. Political figures said that the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, was only ordered to protest the abuse of British citizens in Tianjin, and did not discuss the entire issue, but he himself still hoped that the case could be resolved amicably. It can be seen that Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement is based on new factors, mostly the hope of Ambassador Craigie. Although the Japanese here also hope that a compromise solution can be reached in the Tianjin case, they have not expressed what kind of solution it would be. Diplomatic circles believe that the Japanese side covets the 50 million Chinese currency stored by Chinese banks in the British Concession in Tianjin, even more than the extradition of the four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Geng case. The opposition parties in Parliament deeply believe that Japan will prolong the current ambiguous situation in Tianjin as much as possible, so that the British side will think that a friendly solution is still possible, and postpone the implementation of economic retaliatory measures. At the same time, they will intensify the attack on British prestige, which is why they are so anxious. In short, the British government still hopes that the moderate faction in Japan will avoid economic conflict with Britain and restrain the military, but after waiting for a few days, the moderate faction will be powerless. Then, the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty of 1911 will be declared invalid.

British Woman Continues to Be Humiliated; Japan Considers It Not an Insult

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Tianjin Dispatch: Yesterday, two foreign women were stripped and searched by the Japanese army. Today, according to the manager of the Java Bank, his wife was one of the two foreign women who were stripped and searched by the Japanese army. According to reliable sources, a German, Schessler, was brutally beaten by the Japanese army on Wilson Road last Sunday afternoon. The reason is unknown. Later, he was dragged into the examination room. It was not until Schessler declared that he was German that he was released.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Tianjin Dispatch: When the commander of the Japanese garrison entertained reporters yesterday, he said that the Japanese did not consider the naked search of British citizens to be a disgrace. The Japanese commander smiled and said that he could take off his clothes in front of all the foreign reporters to show that his words were true. When asked what the minimum demands of the Japanese army in Tianjin were, the Japanese commander replied that he could not say. As for whether the Tianjin issue will be resolved in Tokyo, London, or even Tianjin, he also had no idea. He hoped that the problem could be solved locally. When the reporter asked whether the Japanese army would strengthen its blockade, the Japanese commander hesitated for a moment and said that there might be such a possibility.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 27th] Dispatch: The commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin said on the 27th that he had never heard of foreign citizens being forced to undress and be inspected at the entrance of the British Concession, nor had he issued such an order. He has now issued an order to the sentries at various places to investigate foreign citizens. As for nakedness, the Japanese do not consider it a surprise. This can be seen from the Japanese custom of men and women bathing together. He also said that the general public calls it a blockade, but this is not accurate. It can only be said that normal traffic is subject to limited restrictions. We have not prevented food from being transported into the concession. Even if there is a slight delay in time, it is purely because of the strict inspection at the entrance of the concession. In general, this restriction method has not been extended to ships sailing on the Hai River, which must be done upon the order of the government. Therefore, all measures in Tianjin are implemented according to the orders of the government. He concluded that he still hopes that the Tianjin incident can be resolved locally, but unless Britain thoroughly changes its attitude, the current restrictions will not be lifted. According to another dispatch, foreigners in Tianjin generally said that the Anglo-Japanese relations have eased slightly after the commander of the Japanese garrison made a statement. No accidents occurred at the exit of the British Concession today. Two British citizens were only searched for shoes and socks. It is speculated that Anglo-Japanese negotiations may have begun in Tokyo.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 28th] Tianjin Dispatch: Yesterday, a serious incident occurred here in which the Japanese interfered with the sailing of the British-owned Jardine Matheson's ship "Ariadne." The details will not be known until the ship arrives at the British Concession wharf. It is reported that the ship arrived in Tanggu last Sunday and then sailed to Tianjin, arriving at the wharf in front of the former German Concession last Sunday. The Japanese initially refused to allow the ship to sail to the Dalian Steamship Company wharf for inspection. Therefore, the ship was skillfully anchored downstream of the Dalian Steamship Company wharf. Later, the Japanese repeatedly ordered the ship to sail to the wharf for inspection, but then revoked the order again. The food on the ship is now scarce. There are fifteen foreign passengers, including one British woman. The foreign citizens have not had food since noon on Sunday. The Japanese also seem to be preventing the ship from communicating with the shore. The foreign citizens were once informed that they could disembark at 1:00 p.m. on Monday, but they are still being held on the ship. As for the fate of the 200 Chinese passengers on the ship, nothing is known. British Consul-General in Tianjin, Jamieson, has notified British firms that he is preventing British citizens from passing through the obstacles in the Concession, because several British citizens have recently been forced to undress and be searched by the Japanese army.

British Newspapers Continue to Call for a Tough Stance

[Central News Agency, London, 28th] The National Executive Committee of the British Labour Party recently sent a letter to British Prime Minister Chamberlain, requesting him to meet with a delegation from the committee. It is reported that the committee is extremely concerned about the Tianjin incident and strongly advocates that the Anglo-Soviet Agreement should be established as soon as possible, so that effective measures can be taken in response to the Far East incident. The committee held a meeting yesterday to discuss the international situation, paying particular attention to the Anglo-Japanese issue.

[Central News Agency, London, 27th] The attitude adopted by Britain towards the Far East situation was recently commented on in a long article published by the News Chronicle, which said that if we do not retaliate against the provocative actions of the Japanese army, the German National Socialist Party will regard us as insignificant in Europe. The ignorant masses are deluded and even say that Britain does not dare to fight. For example, the German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, encouraged by our calm attitude in the Far East, has been making wild remarks. This is a crisis that cannot be ignored. The best course of action now is to take tough action to respond to the various actions of the Japanese army in Tianjin if they do not stop immediately. At the same time, we should provide large-scale financial and economic assistance to China. If China can receive British assistance, it will inevitably make Japanese imperialism unable to stand on the Asian continent. The US government has already lent a large amount of money to China. If the British government adopts the same policy, it will benefit from it and there will be no doubts.

(Reuters, London, 28th) General Corfe wrote to the "Daily News" stating, "For many years, anyone who has maintained contact with the Far East knows that Japan's goal is not limited to politically and economically dominating China. This is only its first step. Japan's true goal is to establish a vast empire in Asia and the Pacific, to the detriment of our country and other countries, and to seize India and Australia. We must face this challenge. Our position and environment are very good. We should face this challenge with courage and determination. We can greatly strengthen the strength of the fleet at Singapore, because in addition to protecting our interests in the North Sea and the Mediterranean, the joint Anglo-French fleet, we still have the strength to send a powerful fleet to Singapore. In addition, we should do everything possible to assist China in organizing an army, driving the Japanese out of Chinese territory, and stopping trade with Japan. If this can be done with the joint participation of the United States, we will be able to inflict a major, or even fatal, blow on Japan."

[Reuters, London, 28th] "The Times" stated today that "Japan has specifically chosen the past few weeks to challenge Britain, trying to change Britain's attitude towards China and eliminate Britain's interests. If this challenging behavior continues to exist, we will have to respond. Japan is more susceptible to economic pressure than any other country. Most of its industries rely on foreign imports, especially from the British Empire and countries with important interests in China. These countries may be willing to adopt a policy of restricting imports from Japan. However, the Japanese government does not seem to be trending to extremes. If war breaks out, Japan's trade routes and its transportation routes to China can be attacked. We sincerely hope that the recent incidents can be resolved satisfactorily, but the patience of the British people is not without limits."

### Britain and Poland Considering Military Cooperation; Poland Issues National Defense Bonds; People Subscribing Enthusiastically

(Haitong News Agency, Warsaw, 28th) A certain source here announced yesterday that the Anglo-Polish military agreement could be signed within a few days. The details of the agreement are being drafted jointly by the British military authorities and the Polish military delegation currently in London.

(Reuters, Warsaw, 27th) Polish national defense bonds have been subscribed for since March 29, and have now reached 404,000,000 Polish currency.

### US-China Legislation: A Theory of Utter Uselessness - US Legislator's Speech Heavily Criticizes, Unanimously Demanding Passage of Amendment

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] During last night's House debate on the Neutrality Act amendment, Senator Aiden delivered a speech criticizing the Neutrality Act, receiving enthusiastic applause from the audience. He stated that such legislation serves absolutely no purpose, and the United States should lean towards the principles of international law. The Neutrality Act is a mixture of cowardice, greed, and stupidity, filling the entire nation with danger. He added that upon hearing the news of women in the British Empire being stripped and searched by Japanese soldiers, a flimsy shack is insufficient to shield from wind and rain. The United States should take strong action to maintain order and peace.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 26th] The Neutrality Act amendment proposed by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom, which advocates abolishing the current embargo on arms, will be submitted for discussion in the House tomorrow. According to well-informed political sources, if Congress has not voted on the new Neutrality Act by the time of the summer recess, the President may convene a special session of Congress to discuss it. Currently, the State Department also insists on completing this case before Congress adjourns for the summer. It is estimated that Bloom's proposal can be approved by the House, but whether the Senate will pass it remains unknown. Although only twenty or thirty senators oppose the Bloom proposal, most of them are highly respected figures. Therefore, the strength of the opposition in Congress can only be assessed after the House vote by observing the number of votes for and against. At this time, isolationists are saying that if war in Europe is unavoidable, the United States will be unable to prevent it. The core issue is to prevent the United States from being drawn into the vortex. It is inappropriate for President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull to immediately align the United States with the democratic countries of Europe. Those who support amending the current Neutrality Act firmly believe that the United States has the power to prevent war, and believe that if aggressor nations know for certain that the United States will provide material and moral assistance to Britain and France if war breaks out, they will inevitably retreat in the face of difficulty. The only way forward now is to quickly amend the current Neutrality Act so that Chancellor Hitler clearly understands the attitude of the United States, thereby contributing to the establishment of peace. The conflict between isolationists and the government faction is as described above, but in the American press, the majority support amending the Neutrality Act. Only the newspapers owned by Hearst (a giant of the American press with extreme reactionary views) are still urging readers to exert pressure on Congress to reject the Bloom proposal.

(Central News Agency, Washington, 28th) Today, the US government submitted the amendment to the Neutrality Act for discussion in the House. For the sake of detailed discussion, the House may hold an all-night session. The case was first presented by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom, who provided an explanation, stating that the contents of the government amendment are not absolutely unchangeable, and the government is willing to consider all reasonable amendments. He urged any member who believes that the amendment is unreasonable to express their views. Representative Fish stated that the bill is actually a plan for joint British-American operations in times of crisis. If we sell weapons to foreign countries, the United States will inevitably be drawn into the whirlpool of war. Bloom immediately rose to refute this, citing President George Washington's neutrality proclamation of 1793, and stated that the current amendment was drafted based on the spirit of that declaration, and the government's desire to avoid entering the war is equal to everyone else's. Also today, Senator Eban strongly criticized the Neutrality Act, causing a stir throughout the chamber, stating that the Neutrality Act can be said to be useless. The United States should immediately restore the solid foundations of international law. The so-called Neutrality Act is an absurd, foolish, and cowardly manifestation, and its danger will spread throughout the country. When I read that women of the British Empire were being stripped by Japanese soldiers, I could not help but hate the so-called Neutrality Act, which is merely a dilapidated shack that cannot provide even the slightest shelter in a storm. Therefore, the United States should urgently send troops out to fight for peace and order.

### London Fire: Unseen Since 1897 - Women Also Join in Firefighting

[Reuters, London, 27th] Tonight, a major fire broke out in central London, near Fleet Street in the Barbican area. The intensity of the fire is the greatest seen since 1897. The fire destroyed a clothing store and a jewelry store before spreading to a furniture warehouse. The women's auxiliary fire brigade, eager to gain firefighting experience, assisted the official fire brigade in extinguishing the fire. Firefighters bravely climbed onto the rooftops to extinguish the flames. The fire occurred after normal business hours, when most of the buildings were empty, so there were no deaths. Only four people were injured.

### British MP Attacked Simon Because the Automobile Could Not Be Made

(Reuters, London, 27th) British Treasury Secretary Simon insisted in the budget, adding the view of the car horsepower tax, today he met with MPs in the House of Commons criticism that this will affect the export of British cars, Simon said he was willing to consider a new horsepower program adapted to the tax, and said, "The current program will produce a kind of main The purpose is to avoid tax and cars that are not suitable for foreign cities." Among those who asked the government for concessions, many were ardent supporters of the government. He vehemently declared that he would not use cars from January to March, and said, "Tens of millions of people will also be like me.") Simon refused to exempt old cars that are more than two years old from taxation.

### Japan Today

— Shi Chang

Japan lacks all the raw materials for war, which it urgently needs. It must import large quantities of gasoline, iron, coal, cotton, wool, and various chemicals, and in fact, it has been doing so for the past two years. However, these transactions are mostly carried out on a "cash and carry" basis, requiring cash payment. Japan uses the following three methods to cope with this serious problem: (1) Using Japan's gold reserves in New York and London, (2) Intensifying gold coinage in Japan, and (3) Increasing export trade to obtain foreign cash to pay for the purchase of war materials.

By the end of March this year, Japan's finances had reached a very critical point, and the lack of gold reserves caused no small panic. Although Japanese officials maintain absolute silence on these situations, it is an open secret that everyone knows. The production amounts for Taiwan and mainland Japan last year were also not officially announced, but are estimated to be around 65 million yuan, and this year's output may not even reach this amount.

According to Japanese official statistics, Japan's cash shipments to the United States in 1938 decreased by 32 percent compared to 1937. From the records of the US State Department, we can see that Japan did not purchase war materials from the United States in April this year. However, there is no doubt that Japan's purchases of other materials from the United States indirectly contribute to the war effort.

Recently, the Japanese Ministry of Finance, in view of the lack of gold reserves, issued an order requiring all citizens to report all gold rings, bracelets, watch cases, cigarette cases, cutlery, and other metal items to the government by July 5th for government requisition. Japan is scraping together as much metal as possible from the people in order to continue its war of aggression against China. The real situation is evident, and this is a serious phenomenon!

The Japanese government uses artificial control methods to manage prices, hoping to stabilize prices and benefit the people's livelihood. However, people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult, and the number of bankruptcies is countless. The lack of gold reserves and the shortage of various goods will lead to unimaginable consequences. The wartime economy has indeed reached a critical juncture. If the Sino-Japanese conflict stops immediately, whether Japan can overcome its financial difficulties is still a question; moreover, the day of cease-fire is nowhere in sight?

Six months ago, the situation in Japan was not as serious as it is now. Generally, financial leaders were very confident in their country's financial strength, believing that it was sufficient to support the war of aggression against China without causing domestic unrest. However, today in Tokyo, this confidence has been greatly doubted. Although there is no public expression of pessimism on the surface, optimistic rhetoric can no longer be heard.

Since the beginning of this war, we have firmly believed that a prolonged resistance war will lead to the economic collapse of Japan and achieve final victory. Observers from neutral countries have not been able to believe this. But today, Japan's resources are depleted and unable to fight, which has been clearly demonstrated. Based on our belief that resistance will lead to victory and nation-building will be successful, we will surely hasten the arrival of final victory.

### Promoting Tripartite Negotiations - Britain Issues New Instructions - Talks to Resume Within the Week - Germany Continues Negative Propaganda

[Reuters, London, 27th] It is understood that the British government is now issuing new instructions to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, and Special Envoy Strang. The instructions require the two to continue talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov within the week.

[Paris, 27th] Foreign news, according to reliable sources in Belgium, British Foreign Secretary Halifax instructed Special Envoy Strang to accept the Soviet demands and establish a tripartite agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as soon as possible. It is said that Strang received instructions from the British government tonight and arranged to visit the Soviet Foreign Minister on Thursday. The new instructions include: (1) Authorizing Strang to provide nominal guarantees to the Baltic states; (2) If the Baltic states, Poland, or Romania are threatened by aggression and the Soviet Union provides assistance, mutual assistance obligations will automatically arise; (3) The three countries hold staff talks.

[Reuters, London, 27th] It is reported that the National Labor Congress held a meeting today and requested Prime Minister Chamberlain to meet with representatives of the Congress. The Congress will express to Chamberlain its strong desire to quickly form a British-Soviet agreement and take strong measures to cope with the situation in the Far East.

[Haitong Agency, Paris, 28th] The British government has issued new instructions to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, which are expected to be received around Tuesday evening. However, French newspapers published on Tuesday afternoon remained pessimistic about the prospects for British-Soviet negotiations. "Paris Soir" and "L'Ère Nouvelle" both claimed that the British government had fully accepted and made further concessions to Moscow's requests for (1) guarantees for the Baltic states and (2) automatic fulfillment of mutual assistance obligations among the contracting parties. However, it remained uncertain whether Moscow would be satisfied, and it was not impossible for the Soviet Union to further demand that Britain guarantee its Far Eastern border.

[Haitong Agency, Paris, 28th] According to sources close to the French Foreign Ministry on Tuesday evening, the French Foreign Ministry has received intelligence that the content of Britain's new proposals to the Soviet Union is not as broad as generally reported and is not as far-reaching as the British press has portrayed it. It is also highly doubtful whether the British government has fully accepted the principle of "automatic assistance" contained in the tripartite agreement (meaning that if one of the contracting parties is attacked, the other contracting parties must automatically provide assistance). Furthermore, the Soviet Union's firm demand that the names of the Baltic states be explicitly included in the "guarantee clauses" of the tripartite agreement has not yet been accepted by the British government.

### Situation Remains Tense on Mongolian Puppet Border - Seven Japanese Aircraft Shot Down in Attack on Mongolia

[Central News Agency, Hailar, 8th] The situation near Bayar has become increasingly serious yesterday. Fierce air battles broke out there again yesterday morning, and similar air battles will be difficult to avoid in the future. According to Soviet sources, as a result of yesterday's air battle, seven Japanese aircraft were shot down, while the Soviet side lost six. 180 Japanese 'Manchukuo' aircraft invaded Outer Mongolia from the vicinity of Dameske, penetrating as far as 75 miles. Outer Mongolian aircraft immediately took off to engage, resulting in the downing of seven Japanese aircraft. Six Soviet-Mongolian aircraft did not return. When the Japanese aircraft bombed, two houses were destroyed and five civilians were injured. As for the Japanese propaganda, it claimed that Soviet-Mongolian aircraft were shot down by the Japanese side up to 98 aircraft, while the Japanese side only lost three aircraft.

(Central News Agency, Moscow, 27th) Semi-official sources recently received news from the staff of the Soviet and Outer Mongolian armies, claiming that 80 Japanese puppet fighters and 30 bombers conducted air raids today on the areas of Tanchak and Pulak, 120 kilometers inside the border of Outer Mongolia. The Soviet and Mongolian air forces immediately took off to engage, resulting in the downing of five puppet fighters and two bombers. At the same time, six Soviet-Mongolian aircraft did not return, and are currently being searched for. As a result of the air raid, only two houses were destroyed and five people were injured.

### British Military Expenditure: 1 Billion Pounds in Four Years

(Haitong Agency, London, 28th) On Tuesday, British Treasury Secretary Simon replied to a question from Independent Labour Party MP John McGovern in the House of Commons, stating that the total British military expenditure from 1935 to the end of 1938 was £988,588,932, of which £919,300,000 (19%) was obtained through borrowing.

### Daladier States: French Territory Consolidated - Large Army on Strict Guard - House Adjourns Until November

[Reuters, Paris, 27th] French Prime Minister Daladier announced today that the House will adjourn and reconvene in mid-November, stating that "thanks to the strictness of border defenses, peace has been secured." The Prime Minister then answered why the government deemed special national defense precautions necessary, saying, "In twenty years, the situation has never been as serious as it is today. On our border, there are a total of three million soldiers, not including military personnel, and we have heard of concentrations beyond our borders, even more so than in the past. Within our border, reactionary propaganda has been discovered, exploiting religious and human prejudices, intending to undermine the unity of Britain and France." Daladier declared that he had not mobilized a large army, but had convened mobilizable troops, and that it was necessary for two grades of reserves to be trained in the army. The Congress then passed the adjournment bill with 350 votes against 231.

Short Commentary

### Wang Jingwei Flies to Peiping

For the Japanese XX preparing to issue a declaration on the second anniversary of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, organizing a pseudo-Chinese united government, Wang Jingwei, traitor, has flown from Shanghai to Tianjin and then to Peiping to confer with Wang Kemin, traitor, and representatives of the pseudo-government in Nanjing on everything. The Wang traitor has wholeheartedly become a dog of the Japanese XX. The Japanese XX are currently eager to use the words and activities of the Wang traitor to strengthen the rule of the occupied areas and use the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of our occupied areas to attack and conquer our country. Here, we see another fierce appearance of the Japanese XX recently blockading the Tianjin Concession and blockading Shantou, Dinghai, Wenzhou, and Fuzhou. Here, we see another ugly and strange face of the Wang traitor and his group, who extravagantly talk about peace and anti-communism. XX XX XX XX, originally not surprising, but there are still some degenerates who live on friction and get rich from national disasters, but also taste the loss of conscience, regardless of the general situation, are propagating the rhetoric used by the traitor, I hope everyone will not slack off on this.

Spring and Autumn

### I Am a Thing for Ladies to Amuse Themselves With

— Male Dancer

Seeing the sunset slipping over the roof across the street. I have to get dressed again. First, I have to take a bath. Although, I already took a bath when I got up at noon. But, that was just to invigorate myself. Now, I have to be more careful. Add some spices to the bathwater. After washing, apply some scented powder on my body. Sprinkle some top-grade perfume when I put on my clothes. Why? Because I am a "male dancer." For professional reasons, can I let the ladies smell an unclean odor when I accompany them to dance?

After taking a bath and putting on my clothes, I look in the mirror. Not bad, a six-foot-tall figure, with a pretty face. And wearing this streamlined, star-like clothing. Of course, every night, a wad of banknotes will be stuffed into my pocket. I also have to practice my smile in the mirror. This is my usual trick. Look, how tasteful! I know that many women can't stand this kind of energy.

It's still early. Let's slowly walk to the dance hall! This is because now is the time to go. Later, when I have a customer, I won't be able to run on two legs. Anyway, they always have money, and I'm happy to be generous at other people's expense. Take a car. Otherwise, I'll be laughed at.

As soon as I enter the dance hall, I start looking around to see if any old customers have come. My customers are rarely young and pretty girls. Naturally, young and pretty girls are always surrounded by young men. Who needs a "male dancer" like you? I look carefully. On the other side, there is a single old lady sitting. But, don't think she's old. Just look at the clothes she's wearing. They're so fashionable. Such expensive material. She's wearing such big, shiny diamonds. She must be a rich lady from another province. Maybe she's even a Lady So-and-so.

I wait for the music to start, straighten my bow tie, touch my hair, and walk towards her.

"Miss, would you do me the honor?" This is also the only way to eat in our line of work. No matter how wrinkled their face is, calling them "Miss" is never wrong.

She naturally understands my intentions. So, we dance. I sit at her table and chat with her. Maybe she's already quite well-off. Dancing is not very smooth. But, I have to say:

"You dance so lightly and so well."

She's naturally happy. But sometimes, she'll sigh to herself, "Ah, it's no good. I'm getting old."

"Don't say that! You're probably only twenty-five years old this year, right?"

"More than that. I'm thirty-two years old." Actually, I think she's at least forty-two years old. Otherwise, where would I get the courage to discuss age with the ladies!

When she's happy, she naturally talks more. When we talk, whether it's about politics or philosophy, I have to throw in a few sentences, even if I only have a smattering of knowledge. She'll think even more highly of me, thinking that there are such learned people among the "male dancers."

Maybe we'll change a few dance halls, go to eat, and dance. Anyway, she pays for everything. When it's time to leave, if she's happy, she'll tell me where to eat dinner tomorrow. That way, I've already secured a big customer.

When we say goodbye, I always have to say, "Thank you. It's an honor and a pleasure to be with you." So, when we shake hands, a wad of banknotes is transferred to my pocket.

### One Day, One Person

Angrily cursing, even to the ends of the earth, he must catch the hateful, damned dog thief. That afternoon, he suddenly heard a dog bark, it turned out that Scottie was catching mice under the flower shed! The dog came back, but whose footprint was it, strange! strange! Study and compare again, using his detective skills. Sure enough, the thief was found. Humph! , , The hateful thief turned out to be him.

### Weather Forecast

The Tianjin Incident, is going to Tokyo. World affairs. "Originally there is nothing that cannot be solved with the mouth", is it? However, we have to believe that Tokyo is definitely not Munich, China is not Czech, come!

Britain is still unwilling to let go of its interests in the Far East. News came that the British government is preparing to mount two large cannons on ships in the Far East. Good, good. I hope these two cannons can be fired loudly.

For five months, the United States has transported airplanes to Japan worth one million US dollars. The Franco-Japanese trade agreement was signed, and iron and chemical raw materials will be transported to Japan. What is this? Is it called democratic countries opposing aggression??? A bunch of shameless!

The health authorities, the measures to prevent the epidemic in Australia, have been improved. The handling fee has been reduced to 5 jiao, and more injection points have been added. This spirit of following good advice is a good model.

Central stalls, have been re-tendered, the tender price, still not a small amount, ok, I just hope that the winning bidders don't default!

### Tidbits

There was a deaf man who loved to tell jokes all his life, and at the same time hated people knowing he was deaf.

One day, he went to a banquet, and someone told a joke at the table, which caused a burst of laughter. Although the deaf man didn't hear a word, he echoed the laughter and applause as if he knew what was going on.

After a while, no one got up to tell a second joke, and he couldn't help but become itchy, so he volunteered to tell everyone a joke. After saying a few sentences, everyone burst out laughing. He thought that people were so admiring, and he was very happy. So, he spoke excitedly, and the more he spoke, the more everyone laughed.

It turned out that the joke he was telling was the one that the gentleman had just told.

### Anecdotes

Coffee and Tea

You drink tea or coffee every day, do you know, which is more beneficial to the body, tea or coffee?

In the eighteenth century, tea and coffee had been introduced to Sweden. At that time, the Swedes were interested in this issue. However, after research, there were no results. King Gustav III of Sweden came up with a clever idea and came up with the most scientific experimental method. He pardoned a pair of twin brothers who had been sentenced to death to life imprisonment, and placed them in one place, giving one tea every day, and the other coffee; in this way, a pair of twin prisoners escaped from death and lived comfortably. As a result, at the age of eighty-three, the tea drinker unfortunately died, and the coffee drinker was still alive. In this way, the experiment was a great success: proving that tea drinkers have a shorter life than coffee drinkers.

Finally, it must be stated that this is just talking, and there is no intention to make you give up domestic tea and drink Cuban coffee!

### Maritime Winds 18

— Written by Captain Lauton, Translated by Yang Bi

Summary of Previous Chapters: In the autumn of 1914, the German ship "Kroonprinz Wilhelm" carried six million gold bars from New York to Germany. Jack, a radio operator for the Cox Shipping Company, and Bill, a mechanic, also took the ship to travel to Europe. On board, they received news that Britain and Germany had declared war and that British warships were going to intercept the ship. The ship then sped off aimlessly. Soon, it encountered icebergs and was bombarded by British ships. It barely escaped and returned to the American harbor, White Sea. Jack and Bill prepared to return to New York...

Late in the afternoon, they handed their luggage over to the shipping company for transport, and the three of them took the night train back to New York.

As soon as they got off the train, Jack rushed to Mr. Cox's office.

"Reed! You're here, that's great!" Mr. Cox exclaimed as they shook hands. "The St. Kilda leaves for Europe tomorrow, but I still don't know which ports she will stop at; I'm afraid that will depend on the captain's temporary decisions."

"But, Mullen is on the St. Mark," Jack said, a little confused, "I don't want to take his job, and..."

"And you're still on vacation," Mr. Cox interrupted, "I understand all of this, Reed, as long as you believe that I agree with your intentions, it won't make things difficult for you in the slightest. I'm asking you to go with the St. Mark now, not entirely as a radio operator, but also for a personal matter. My son Tom is currently in France. I haven't received a single word from him since the war started. The last I knew, he drove a car north of Paris, and he may have gone to Belgium because that was also part of his planned itinerary."

"You want me to look for him?" Jack asked slowly.

"That's right, I know it's a troublesome matter, but I think you can handle it. Money is no problem; spend as much as you need, just find that boy. His mother is worried sick about this, and I'm about to get sick too."

"I am willing, and happy to do this job, Mr. Cox," Jack said, "But, you understand, if we're talking about success, there's only a one percent chance. And, perhaps the St. Mark hasn't even arrived in Europe yet, and you'll already have his news."

"I'll take my chances," the wealthy man said, "I just feel it's the right thing to do to look for him."

"Since that's the case, I'll do my best."

"Thank you, Reed, thank you, I know you won't let me down. Now let's talk about expenses. They tell me that the financial situation there is very chaotic right now. American paper money and traveler's checks are not usable, or maybe Tom is stuck because of this. You should bring cash, here." As he spoke, he took out a checkbook from the drawer, signed a check, and wrote a number that made Jack stick out his tongue.

### International Exchange Center Remains Unchanged, Shanghai Still Holds Financial Hub, Commerce, Industry and Real Estate Quite Active, Mainland Funds Return to Shanghai Market

3.  Collection of Bills

Regarding the payment of bills collected on behalf and outside the scope of exchange, the total amount collected this year was $485,851,818.51, based on 435,577 bills. The daily average was $1,646,955.32, with 476 bills. Compared with the daily average of the previous year, the amount decreased by 58.23 percent, and the number of bills decreased by 51.81 percent. The collection amount on December 31 reached $4,707,811.30, and the collection of 4,670 bills on October 11 were both the highest records of the year. The collection and settlement of check amounts between Chinese and foreign banks has been centered on the Bank of China since the abolition of taels and the conversion to yuan. After August 13, the Bank of China moved to the western district, and due to the distance, there were obstacles in terms of time and procedures. This agency collection and settlement was temporarily suspended, and various industries had to open current accounts with foreign banks to facilitate payment and settlement. This resulted in the distinction between Bund clearing and exchange clearing, which was deeply inconvenient for the industry. The association repeatedly consulted with the Bank of China and the Central and Communications Banks to seek improvement. Finally, in the winter of this year, a thorough solution was agreed upon. The three banks dispatched personnel to the association to handle the collection and settlement of foreign bank payments for various industries. From December 1, payments for bills payable to the Bund by various industries were uniformly paid through the association and settled by the three banks. The adjustment of industry funds could be restored to convenience.

4.  Statistics of Returned Bills

The total number of returned bills after exchange this year was 40,487, with an average of 137 returned bills per day, accounting for 3.46 percent of the average daily bills, a decrease of 0.74 percent compared with the percentage of the previous year.

The number of drafts that had not matured by the end of the year was 40, totaling 2,000,000 yuan in national currency. The average term of drafts is mostly 30 days and 90 days.

2.  Discount Transactions

The total number of discount transactions for accepted drafts by this institution this year was 10,930,000 yuan in national currency, a decrease of 900,000 yuan compared with the previous year.

### Teaching Trial

— Especially

Boredom, tedium, using idleness to pass the long years, one o'clock, yes, even though it's just sixty minutes, but it feels like the slowness of a year! Yes, it's spring, the vines on the fence outside the pavilion are nurturing vigorous energy, the morning sun shines on the tender green leaves, and the night dew shines like pearls. Looking at the endless floating clouds, a heavy lead presses on my chest, and my heart is as withered as death.

Idleness? Damn, my stomach can't accept your dictation of idleness!

So what should I do? There are so many people, everywhere like piles of ants, looking for a way out? Humph, I never thought Shanghai could be so deformed, and this deformity is blocked by a layer of miasma.

I can't say what kind of mood it is, but suddenly I want to subscribe to a newspaper. Do I want to see domestic and foreign news and war movements? No. Do I want to see some commentaries and essays? No. Do I want to see alluring advertisements for theaters and dance halls? Even less. The goal is very simple: I want to seek in that large classified advertisement section, to seek, to obtain unexpected luck.

So, I spend a lot of time on solicitations, hiring, notices, businesses, and every corner. One day, two days, passed silently.

One day, there was such a paragraph in the solicitation section:

"Now, a certain school is being established and wants to hire two elementary school class teachers. They must be hardworking and able to endure hardship, and half-heartedly volunteer. They must first have a two-month trial teaching period before being hired. Those who are interested, please contact at × address from × day to × day."

Elementary school class teacher, I can try this. Obeying the specified date, I rushed there, the trial teaching and hiring constantly wavering in my mind.

I arrived, it must be there, people were darkly sunk. From that small door, they lined up straight to the street, crowding, with anxious eyes. I took a few breaths of cold air, almost abandoning all my previous courage.

Waiting, waiting, for more than two hours. Without being asked, I filled out the mimeographed form and handed it to that thin, tall man. On the wall was posted:

"All applicants please wait for the examination. Those who are suitable will be notified separately."

Returning home, my head was dizzy, maybe I shouldn't have delusions!

What should I say? Was it a surprise or...? On the fifth day, a notification letter came, saying to call me to trial teaching. Good, let's say it was a fluke.

That night, I drank a lot of wine.

Everything is proceeding smoothly, seven hours a day, with a free lunch, teaching fourth grade, not including grading papers and other things.

Time will not stop, and the two months passed unconsciously under intense work. This is a critical moment, and my whole mood is not peaceful for a moment. With my own diligence, I will be hired, right? I thought.

But damn it, diligence is worth shit!

A few days over two months, another letter was sent – the beginning was innocuous words of admiration and respect, followed by things like few students and financial difficulties, then some hosts were going abroad and had no intention of operating, and the end?

"We respectfully offer 15 yuan for trial teaching travel expenses, please check and accept."

Here, a head-on blow drives you out.

"Go to hell." Maybe they even gave a contemptuous sneer.

Anger, hatred, disgust, intertwined into a complex emotion, I poured wine into my chest, burning the fire of my heart, clenched my fists, and looked at the starry sky, one cup after another.

In a few days, a notice soliciting teachers appeared again in a corner of the advertisement. The content of the notice was almost the same as last time, but this time there was no address, replaced by the newspaper's mailbox. Maybe this time I won't suffer the same as I did? I hope not, I thought.

Of course, as you can imagine, different letters were thrown into the mailbox from different directions, one after another. Among these letters, aren't there a few who are accepting this unexpected luck under a surprising mood?

The leaves of the vines on the fence are denser, winding and climbing up the roof, extending to all parts, the willow branches of the weeping willows caress people's faces, and pairs of butterflies shuttle through the flowers, telling you that the time has come to summer.

It's a real adventure, a real adventure, the solicitation appeared for the third time, but the location was a new place.

Is it curiosity? Again, with a heart that has suffered painful wounds, I rushed there. Damn it, isn't that thin, tall man the same as before? As if encountering a monster, I staggered back. However, people are not afraid of not having it, and a group of people went into that small doorway.

The occupied areas are refurbished, and the teaching trial should admire the wisdom of the inventor. After three trial teachings, half a year has been spent, and the reward for each time is less than half of the normal!

Fraud, exploitation, are intertwined into the prosperity of the metropolis. In prosperity, there are unpredictable and terrible shadows lurking.

### Dived Towards the Motherland

— Jin Yi

—Still a story about a girl—

Jingwen pouted and said that on this trip, she only slept and vomited, no wonder she wanted to leave the ship early.

"What can we do? I think they must also know about these troubles if they live here."

Sitting anxiously, standing, waiting for three hours, the steward finally called for the passengers to go to the deck because the quarantine officer was here.

"I refuse to go, let's see what they do to me!"

Jingwen said stubbornly because she hadn't eaten or drunk along the way, and her face was very bad.

"Then why bother? We didn't come here to pick a fight with them. In half a day, we'll be in Guangzhou."

Qingzhi pulled the angry Jingwen onto the deck; many people had already lined up at that time. The first-class passengers had already transported their belongings down, and together with the passengers, took a small steamship to the shore; but they were still standing or lined up there one by one.

It was like a long line of prisoners. The doctor sitting there was like a prison warden. He watched each person walk past him, took the vaccination certificate from his hand, and looked at it. As long as he shook his head slightly, someone would pull the passenger out and stand on the other side. By the time they were all examined, it would be dark.

They said as if relieved:

"That's good, we can still make it to the top to have dinner."

"Then let's quickly pack our things."

But when they returned to the cabin, the steward said to them:

"You can't go ashore today, you can only go up tomorrow."

"Why, why can't we go up?"

"One of the doctors is sick. The medical officer said it was an infectious disease. The passengers on the ship must be quarantined for 24 hours. If it is not an infectious disease, you can go up."

"If it's an infectious disease, they really won't let us go up?" (To be continued)

### Some Opinions on Improving Cantonese Opera

— Luo Ying

The most natural trend is to involve improving Cantonese opera from the perspective of "popularizing local arts." However, for a theory to be able to promote practical application, one must grasp a reliable starting point and work hard through all kinds of difficulties.

In the many problems of the past, we have often seen enthusiastic discussions at the beginning, followed by magnificent theoretical constructions, and finally disappearing coldly and faintly. This bad phenomenon of beginning without end is most likely to have a bad influence on people. It is no wonder that the general public mostly regards theorists as "big guns" who talk empty talk and ruin things.

Improving Cantonese opera is now one of the most meaningful and urgently needed things. Carrying it out simultaneously with the work of saving the country and propaganda is even more opportune and in a suitable environment. If this time we really want to promote it, we will surely get good results. We can also hope to lay a solid foundation.

Take a look at the past workers who improved old dramas. They found ways from nowhere, learned experience from hardship, and finally, through thousands of hopeless failures, they were able to promote civilized drama and then lay the foundation for spoken drama. Who can say that today's spoken drama can be promoted and carried forward without the credit of the improvers of old dramas in the past?

Some may say that the original purpose of improving Cantonese opera is to improve Cantonese opera itself a little, and to create another kind of drama. And the original purpose of improving old dramas was also to improve the old dramas themselves, but the effect received by this movement was not to complete the original task, but to complete another task of laying the foundation for spoken drama. It seems that this fact does not have a direct connection with improving special drama, and there is no need to pull it here. The purpose of presenting this fact is not to prove the possibility of improving Cantonese opera. It is precisely because we want to make those who are now interested in improving Cantonese opera understand the spirit of the predecessors who forged ahead bravely and the courage of arduous struggle, that we especially mention it here.

The work of improving Peking opera is being carried out very enthusiastically in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region. According to reports from all parties, it not only confirms the possibility of fundamental improvement of Peking opera, but also has achieved very good results. If it continues to develop, there will not be much problem in achieving its purpose.

Improving Cantonese opera and improving Peking opera probably have the same purpose and task. Even if the methods and means used in practice may be different, since Peking opera can be improved, then Cantonese opera cannot be an exception. What should be paid attention to is the determination of the workers.

Now it's time to talk about the specific methods to start with.

In a big city full of copper smell, suddenly launching a risky attempt, to fight against a deeply rooted listening force, if there is no considerable preparation and sufficient strength, it is difficult to start. As far as improving Cantonese opera is concerned, to implement it in the city, first of all, you should write improved scripts that can be adapted for stage performance; secondly, you should especially find Cantonese opera troupes that dare to take the risk of trying to perform; finally, you also need to get theater owners who are happy to stage those improved scripts. Before these three difficulties can be overcome, nothing can be done, how to overcome them? I think people who are old in the theater movement will definitely understand. The degree of difficulty is also what they have experienced. If they can apply all the past experience appropriately, I don't think there will be no way.

Regarding the script and actor issues, if you can get the cooperation of the troupe's playwrights and actors, you can naturally receive twice the results with half the effort. Otherwise, you should write the play yourself from the reformer's side, and at the same time train the actors, so that there is hope to start. However, this method requires sufficient time to work hard and slowly develop. In order to use improved Cantonese opera as a weapon of propaganda against the war of resistance in a short period of time, you cannot spend too much time.

The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region's improved Peking opera movement started from the countryside and from the staff themselves, which is relatively easy and worth emulating. Therefore, in addition to launching improvement work in the cities, on the other hand, we should mobilize staff who understand how to write Cantonese opera to quickly write new Cantonese operas. At the same time, among the young staff, select those who understand how to sing Cantonese opera, train them, and then perform Cantonese opera in their workplaces. Although in terms of technology and reputation, they may not be able to keep up with formal actors for a while. But in the war zone, there are no formal troupes performing, and one day there will be this unique temporary Cantonese opera. I believe that the general "Cantonese" people will not only not be picky about their skills, but on the contrary, they will definitely think it is rare and give a warm welcome.

There was a time when many college and high school students in Guangzhou considered it fashionable to organize a Cantonese opera troupe. On their school anniversary or public holidays, they would first find opportunities to hold open parent-teacher conferences or variety shows and perform Cantonese opera. Although their singing skills could not surpass the formal troupe. However, they also gained a warm welcome among the citizens, because it was valuable that they could perform opera. If they can solemnly take on the responsibility of improving Cantonese opera and not be proud of being the tail of the old troupe: and maintain a consistent attitude, and not aim at temporary novelty: by today, the improvement of Cantonese opera will always have considerable achievements to see.

In the vast youth group, it is not absolutely impossible to find some staff who can be trained into Cantonese opera performers in a short period of time. Although the trend of young people loving to perform Cantonese opera has passed, aren't today's many youth music groups also fond of singing Cantonese songs? If we can win them over and train them into a small troupe to work in the countryside, performing short plays about the war of resistance, it would be the most convenient thing. Under the general goal of the united front, unemployed actors with a sound consciousness can also be absorbed.

Being able to launch a broad Cantonese opera improvement movement, and being able to launch it simultaneously in cities and villages, is of course the best thing. If there is not so much manpower, material resources, and energy for a while, then starting from the countryside is a reliable preliminary method. After the foundation is solid, and if a large audience can be won, then various troupes will naturally be affected and change their original style. Otherwise, they will also be naturally eliminated and unable to stand.

In short, to complete this arduous task, we must mobilize the enthusiastic participation of the majority of cultural figures and workers to achieve something. Without using a large amount of manpower and material resources, we cannot have a fierce struggle with the deeply rooted Cantonese opera. Work hard, those who intend to improve Cantonese opera, now is the most appropriate time.

### Homeland in the Flames of War

— He Chengjiang

A round mirror-like moon hangs high in the vast sky. I lean alone on the railing of the building, quietly lost in reverie. I think of my homeland.

My homeland is located in the lower reaches of the West River, belonging to Shunde and bordering Panyu. It's a small, beautiful village. Any steamer sailing from Guangzhou to the West River passes by there. The journey from Guangzhou takes about one and a half to two hours. At the edge of the village is an old ferry crossing, a fortress, a field, a stretch of pine forest, a white pebble road, a small hill, and a river. Entering the village, the houses stand neatly side by side, with a clear stream, swaying banyan trees, and a stone bridge. In the river, rafts of fir wood float. Ah, homeland! These two words bring me endless comfort. On my travels, I often secretly murmur them, along with the sweet names of my loved ones.

I remember when I was a child, in front of the old temple in my homeland, there was an open space where I would join a group of children, rolling iron hoops, chasing each other, playing hide-and-seek, and singing "Moonlight, Moonlight." When I grew a little older, I went to elementary school, carrying my schoolbag to school in the early morning and carrying it back in the evening. After dinner, I would go out to play with my friends. It was such innocence.

Under the banyan trees, at the head of the stone bridge, every year in late July and August, rows of bamboo sheds would be set up for the seedling market. Farmers would come there with their hoes to buy and sell rice seedlings. The sound of counting was so clear. The people were so sincere and honest.

I lived on this side of the bridge, and she lived on the other side. However, separated only by a narrow strip of water, we met at the bridgehead day after day and became acquainted. I loved her. Sometimes I would wait for her at the bridgehead in the evening, and sometimes I would fish by the stream, listening to her soft singing and the stream's melody. Her name was Lei Xueqiu.

I think it was when I was sixteen that I left my homeland and entered society. Driven by the whip of life, I had to drift and sink in this fragrant sea! The red kapok in spring, the lotus in summer, the chrysanthemum in autumn, the plum blossom in winter, the fish-belly white of the eastern sky, quickly replaced by the crimson glow of the western sunset. Day after day, a page was turned. The chirping of insects at night, the cuckoo's call, the autumn rain beating on the window, the spring breeze wafting through the curtains – how could I cast aside the memories of my homeland on my travels?

Time has swallowed my innocence and brilliance, and the years have crushed many beautiful dreams like clouds and smoke. The cruelty of reality and the hardships of the environment have strengthened my spirit of struggle. Like a bird leaving its nest, flying out into the fields to find food, my homeland is that nest.

However, the magpie's nest was occupied by the eastern bandits in October last year. They shattered the beauty and tranquility of my homeland. To avoid the ambushes of our brothers' defense team, they burned the bamboo forests, torched the rice paddies, seized pigs and chickens, and searched for young women. The women suffered the most harassment and devastation, and the young men were most hated. However, the guerrilla's elusive and cunning movements eventually rendered the enemy helpless. They couldn't sleep soundly at night.

Perhaps there is bloodshed on the White Stone Bridge? Are there floating corpses in the small stream? Has the large banyan tree been burned by the wildfire? Surely enemy speedboats have sunk in the big river. The dense mulberry groves are the South's unique green curtain, the best hiding place for guerrillas to ambush the enemy. But has it suffered from the enemy's wildfire? But it cannot be burned completely, I think.

I have been away from my homeland for a long time, and I don't clearly know the true situation now? And I haven't received any news from home for a long time. How I miss it!

Now I am leaning on the railing, gazing at the sky. A round bright moon shines on the traveler. White clouds fly with the wind. My homeland must be under the clouds? I miss it.

### Fuzhou and Wenzhou Exchange Suspended, British Warship Carries Passengers into Shantou Harbor, × Eager to Actively Eliminate the Rights and Interests of Third Countries, Invade Foreigners' Properties, and × Machines Threaten British Vessels. Nobel Will Return to Hong Kong from Singapore and Then Go North to Negotiate with ×.

The British-Japanese relationship in Shantou suddenly turned serious last month. × does not allow British merchant ships to enter Shantou Harbor, while the British authorities in Shantou strongly protested to × on the one hand and actually sent warships to carry passengers ashore on the other hand, breaking through ×'s blockade. The situation is very serious. The situations in Wenzhou and Fuzhou are also tense. Exchange between the two places and Hong Kong was interrupted yesterday.

Fuzhou and Wenzhou Ports Interrupted

Following the emergencies in Fuzhou and Wenzhou, shipping between Hong Kong and these two ports was interrupted yesterday. The Bank of China and other banks suspended exchange with Fuzhou and Wenzhou from yesterday morning. Telegrams were still going through yesterday morning, but transmission was slightly slower than usual.

Foreign Warships Still Not Withdrawing

Regarding ships, the Taikoo ship Ninghai was forced to return to Hong Kong yesterday. The Chongqing, which was originally scheduled to depart from Hong Kong at 4:00 PM today, has canceled its sailing. The Lian Tong of E-Sun Company is currently in Wenzhou. It is expected that the ship was also forced to leave the port yesterday. × forced British and American warships to withdraw from Wenzhou or Fuzhou by noon today, but this unreasonable request will be rejected. Currently, two British warships are stationed in Fuzhou, one is the Duchess, and one is the Valiant. Both ships are ordered to provide escort and disregard ×'s warning to British merchant ships not to enter the port. The Douglas ship Haicheng and the Taikoo ship Xinjiang are currently there. The American ship Cosveli has also arrived in Fuzhou. According to confirmed news from a nursing sister here, × aircraft did fly over British ships in Wenzhou and Fuzhou and dropped warnings, forcing the British ships to withdraw immediately.

In Shantou, the British warship Danae and the Scott are still docked, along with the American warships Pierre Bailey and King, for a total of four foreign warships. The British warship Scott briefly returned to Hong Kong some days ago, but returned to Shantou yesterday. Yesterday, the British Consul in Shantou, Li Fulin, protested to the × Consul because × violated its promise and prevented British merchants from entering the port. Li pointed out that China and Japan have not declared war, so ×'s illegal blockade of Shantou Harbor cannot be recognized and demanded that × allow British merchants to enter freely.

Japanese Consul's Unreasonable Remarks

The × Consul defended himself with unreasonable arguments to the British Consul, saying that current wars are often fought without a declaration of war and rejected the British Consul's request. It is said that in order to maintain the current order, foreign ships are temporarily not allowed to enter Shantou Harbor uniformly. The steps currently taken by the Japanese authorities are the result of the unfriendly attitude taken by the British side and the fact that British merchant ships are ordered to enter Shantou Harbor. However, in any case, the Japanese authorities allow one foreign ship to enter each week. The ship is only allowed to load and unload mail and provide food for foreign residents. Currently, the British side has decided to safeguard its rights and interests. Admiral Nobel, the commander-in-chief of the British Far East Navy, went to Singapore to preside over the British-French military conference. He has now returned to Hong Kong by ship and will arrive this week. He will stay in Hong Kong for two days and then go north. At that time, he will raise the issue of the unreasonable blockade of various trading ports by the × side.

British Warship Carries Passengers into Shantou Harbor

According to news received here, the Douglas ship New Haicheng arrived in Shantou yesterday. The ship weighs 2,455 tons and departed from Hong Kong the day before yesterday. Another ship was the Taikoo ship Guangdong. When both ships arrived in Shantou yesterday, they did not enter Shantou Harbor. However, one passenger and a batch of mail on the New Haicheng were transferred by small boat to the British warship Scott, which sailed into Shantou Harbor. The passenger and mail landed safely, thus breaking through the blockade of the × army. It is said that the passengers and mail on the Taikoo ship Guangdong will also be transported ashore by the British warship late last night.

Invasion of Foreigners' Properties in Shantou

According to foreign news, British commercial properties in Shantou have been occupied by ×, and the British flag has been taken down and replaced with the flag. The British commercial properties have been used by the × army as landing sites or warehouses, and × transport ships are docked there. Foreign residents are extremely distressed. It is also said that Norwegian and other foreign merchant ships have temporarily stopped calling at Shantou.

### Report from Portuguese Newspaper: Guangzhou × Suddenly Retreats, No × Troops Seen Guarding Important Strongholds, × Warships Also Disappear Simultaneously, Intention Unknown.

According to a report in a Portuguese newspaper yesterday, the newspaper suddenly received a report from the commissioner stationed in Shameen stating that the × occupying Guangzhou suddenly retreated starting yesterday. Although the news has not been officially confirmed, it is quite reliable. According to the commissioner's report, the troops stationed in Guangzhou have suddenly disappeared completely. Even in the various military strongholds in the city, no × troops are seen guarding them. The Bund area is an important transportation hub and a very important location. It has always been guarded by × naval and land forces, with strict precautions. However, starting yesterday (the 27th), the troops have disappeared without a trace. Even the defensive works that were previously deployed have been completely dismantled. On the White Swan River, several × gunboats have been anchored, but they have also disappeared at the same time, their whereabouts unknown. The intention of this sudden retreat by the × naval and land forces is unclear, as there have been no major or sudden changes in the recent situation in Guangzhou. According to general observations, if the news of the withdrawal of × from Guangzhou is confirmed, it is expected to be due to the extremely unfavorable international situation for ×. The British warship Moth, stationed in Guangzhou, left the province and arrived in Hong Kong last night. The situation in the city seen when setting off was quiet. The ship also carried four Chinese sailors who landed from the naval dockyard, carrying 600 silver dollars, which were discovered by the police and detained for investigation.

### Women's War Relief Association Plans to Donate Two Ambulances to the Chongqing Relief Committee... and Generals Li and Bai... Standard National Flag Donations on the First Day Achieve Good Results...

The Women's War Relief Association is now, at the behest of Madam Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, raising funds for an ambulance to donate to the Chongqing China Red Cross Relief Committee. In addition, Generals Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi have sent a letter requesting an ambulance to facilitate transportation. However, with economic considerations as the driving force, efforts to raise funds are also becoming more active.

Currently underway are: (1) the "July 7th" Flag Donation Fundraising; (2) a charity performance by the China National Salvation Drama Troupe at the Lee Theatre for three consecutive days on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of next month to raise funds for the Association; (3) a charity performance by Xin Ma Shi Zeng at the Queen's Theatre on the 25th of next month to raise funds for one day to purchase first aid kits to be donated to Generals Yue Fei and Xue Li. It is understood that the China National Salvation Drama Troupe went abroad for publicity. This time, passing through Hong Kong, they raised funds for the Relief Federation. Their artistic skills are profound and lifelike, giving the overseas Chinese a very good impression, which need not be elaborated on. Xin Ma Shi Zeng's singing of "Dwarf Melon Not Yet Made" is unusually tragic, lingering for three turns, and can inspire the patriotic feelings of overseas Chinese. Regarding the donation of standard national flags, the team members gathered at the Association at 9:00 AM yesterday. The team leader, Xin Ma Shi Zeng, dispatched 19 team members, divided into ten shifts to take turns. The goal of the first day's flag donation was major banks, large companies, and factories, with very good results. The team members, ladies, traveled far in the sweltering heat, their merits are for the country, which is admirable. It is said that today is the second day of flag donation, and the destinations are still major stores.

### Secondary School Graduation Examinations; First District Conducted Well; Second District Examinations Begin Today

The autumn graduation examinations for private and government-registered secondary schools in Hong Kong were conducted under the responsibility of Zhang Ziyang, an inspector dispatched by the Guangdong Department of Education. For the convenience of administrative procedures, the schools were divided into districts for the examinations. The first district, including Lingdao, Gangqiao, Zhongnan, Xinan, Zhonghua, Guanghua, Yangzhong, Xinxu, Jinling, Holy Trinity, Pui Ying, and Meifang schools, began examinations on the 26th and were completed yesterday. Most of the participants were junior high school graduates, with only a small number of senior high school graduates. In addition to appointing examination supervisors to reside in the halls for supervision, Inspector Zhang also personally visited the schools daily to inspect the procedures, which were very strict. It is said that after the examinations in the first district were completed, the examination supervisors reviewed the papers and submitted them to the teachers designated by the principals of each school for grading in the schools on the specified date. The process went very well and was satisfactory. The second district (Wan Chai) and (Mong Kok) schools, including Chi Tak, Mengnan, Guangda Affiliated Middle School, Zhi Yong, De Ming, Min Fan, Shi Men, Su Zhong, Yao Yu, True Light, Mei Hua, and Hua Ying schools, will begin examinations today, scheduled for three days, and will be completed soon.

Those who fail may retake the failed subjects or repeat the grade in the next session. The exam questions are set by the authorities themselves.

### Returned Tenancy Units in Central Market Re-Tendered Yesterday, Prices Still High; Chicken and Duck Stalls Fetch Over $180

Since the opening of Central Market in Chung King Street, some stallholders, due to excessive rent and losses, could not sustain their business and voluntarily ceased operations, returning their tenancy to the Urban Council. A total of 73 stalls were returned, including 7 fish stalls, 10 beef stalls, 13 pork stalls, 35 vegetable stalls, 5 lettuce stalls, and 3 chicken and duck stalls. Yesterday, the health authorities conducted a public re-tendering for 32 stalls, including pork, beef, and chicken/duck stalls, at the council premises based on the original reserve prices. Yesterday morning, many market traders attended the Health Department to bid for the tenancies, and the prices were high. For example, the reserve price for chicken and duck stalls was $60, but the highest bid reached over $180. The reserve price for fish stalls was $40, but the highest bid reached over $84, all exceeding the reserve prices. The retendering of lettuce and vegetable stalls is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 30th at the council premises, also based on the original reserve prices.

### Fees for Vaccination Certificates for Travel to Macau Reduced by 50 Cents; Sir Lo Yuk-ho Intercedes on Behalf of Travelers; Governor Gladly Approves and Orders Fee Reduction

In order to prevent the spread of rabies, the Hong Kong health authorities are cooperating with the Macau authorities on epidemic prevention. All travelers traveling between Hong Kong and Macau must be vaccinated and possess vaccination certificates to be allowed to land. The Port Health Office has established vaccination sites not only in its own office but also in front of the Customs House on Connaught Road Central. Yesterday, a second branch was added at the old National Hospital Outpatient Clinic. However, the fee for issuing the certificate is $2, which is considered difficult for ordinary travelers. In Macau, vaccinations are free of charge, and the Macau government's measures are generally considered appropriate. Sir Lo Yuk-ho, the Senior Unofficial Member, received complaints from all parties yesterday and immediately inquired with the Director of Medical and Health Services about the purpose of the fees. He learned that the $2 fee charged by the health authorities was not for medicine or procedures, but for the cost of the certificate, as certificates must be stamped. Sir Lo Yuk-ho immediately met with Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote, conveying the difficulties of the people and interceding on behalf of the travelers. The Governor gladly approved and immediately notified the Director of Medical and Health Services that, from now on, travelers to Macau requesting vaccination will be charged only 50 cents for the certificate.

### Newspaper Distributors' Association Schedules Re-election of Officers

It is said that the Hong Kong Newspaper Distributors' Association has recently gained several hundred new members. As the association's headquarters are far away in Lai Chi Kok Road, Kowloon, it is deeply inconvenient. Therefore, it has recently leased a new office at 81 Sai Yeung Choi Street South, 4th Floor, Hong Kong. The original headquarters in Kowloon remains the same. In addition, in order to strengthen internal organization and welcome new members, a temporary emergency meeting of all officers was held on the 25th of this month, resolving to hold a general members' gathering at the Da Dao Big Star Tea Restaurant at 9:00 PM on July 1st to discuss future association development plans and re-elect the next term of officers.

### Refugee Camp Population Increases Due to Continuous Transfer of Homeless Poor into the Camp

Due to the Hong Kong authorities' decision to improve the appearance of the city, the homeless poor have recently been continuously transferred to refugee camps, resulting in a sudden increase in the number of refugees accommodated in the camps. Last week, the government refugee camps housed a total of 9,717 people, which increased to 9,855 people this week. The following is a comparative statistical summary of the number of refugees accommodated in each government refugee camp for the past two weeks, as released by the authorities:

### Vietnamese Government Confirms Enactment of Increased Foreign Residence Tax; Effective July 1st, Tax Increased Ninefold from Original Daily Rate; Business Community Will Request Intervention by Foreign Affairs Department

The issue of Vietnam's restrictions on the entry and transit of foreigners has been of great concern to merchants and travelers. Yesterday, it was confirmed that the Vietnamese government had indeed issued an order to take effect on July 1st: (1) The foreign residence tax will be increased ninefold from the original daily rate. However, merchants with business licenses exceeding 60 dollars, the disabled and elderly unable to work, the poor, and foreign workers with monthly salaries below 30 dollars are exempt from the increased residence tax. However, all foreigners entering the country must declare, or face penalties according to the law. (2) Starting July 1st, foreigners purchasing property in Haiphong for industrial purposes will be taxed at a rate of 20 dollars per 100 dollars of rental value. The Vietnamese mail received by a certain Vietnamese firm in Hong Kong yesterday only contained the above information. Detailed content is pending further reports. Due to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, Vietnam has become a convenient route for Chinese people to enter and exit the country, and traffic has been brisk. However, the complex Vietnamese laws have already been troublesome for travelers. Now, with the sudden increase in the residence tax rate, the burden on merchants and travelers will be even greater. Major business figures are paying close attention to this matter. Once a detailed study has been completed, they will intercede on behalf of travelers and appeal to the diplomatic authorities to negotiate with the Vietnamese government to implement good neighborly relations and improve entry and transit procedures for the convenience of travelers.

### Breaking Through the Hardships on the Eve of Victory, Unleashing the Climax of Commemorating "July 7th" – Donations! Flower Sales! Vegetarian Meals!

— Qi Zhuo

Also Introducing Mr. Lin Peisheng, Who Eagerly Contributes

Thinking of "The Frontline Supporting with Blood and Flesh," Can We "Live in Comfort with Plenty of Fish and Shrimp" and Feel at Ease?

Originally, overseas compatriots, witnessing, hearing, and personally experiencing how to gain honor and how to suffer insults, have felt it all intimately. The seeds of avenging and revitalizing the country are widely sown in the hearts of overseas compatriots, which is naturally inevitable in terms of both "emotion" and "reason." However, unfortunately, bad people have ruined good things! The slander of traitors and unfilial people is at work!

Therefore, things like "forsaking meals due to anxiety," "passing off responsibility to others," "hesitating and watching," "selfishness and self-interest"... these inferior qualities have played a detrimental fermenting role among short-sighted overseas compatriots. Once the decadent trend arises, everyone becomes nearsighted, putting personal interests first. Patriotic actions are only done "slightly" to cover up the development of their pathological psychology. Those who have lost their minds even say, "National affairs, what do I care!"

The donation achievements of Hong Kong compatriots after the War of Resistance are far inferior to those of Singapore, which is a well-known fact. However, this is not because Hong Kong compatriots are inferior in essence, but because the atmosphere has not been created and public opinion has not generated power, which are important factors. To prescribe the right medicine, the task of enthusiastic overseas compatriots and the opinion circles in the future is even more arduous.

Therefore, we express our infinite hope for the second anniversary of the "July 7th" War of Resistance and National Construction.

The eve of final victory is the most difficult stage. Breaking through the hardships of this moment and welcoming the coming of light is the central task of this year's commemoration of "July 7th." The sudden changes in Chaoshan and the emergencies in coastal ports only increase our acute pain, but there is no reason to shake our confidence in the War of Resistance. Hong Kong compatriots should intensify their donation campaign during this year's "July 7th" to enrich national strength and win the sympathy of friendly nations, which is their bounden duty.

Regarding "donations," the Amateur Association is actively preparing. Various relief associations are also conducting precise plans for "flower sales" and "vegetarian meals." In order to promote "donations," "flower sales," and "vegetarian meals" into a climax for this year's commemoration of July 7th, introducing and praising overseas compatriots who actively contribute is a necessary task for those who hold the pen.

Although the number of Hong Kong overseas compatriots who actively contribute cannot compare with Singapore, there are indeed many people who do so. Especially the lower-class working masses, whose strength cannot be ignored. However, in terms of economics, the entire property of thousands of working classes is still not worth a drop in the bucket of the propertied class. In terms of "giving money," it is really necessary to mobilize the upper class.

Regarding the fact that the "rich" in Hong Kong "give money," there are indeed many examples, but Mr. Lin Peisheng has to be said to be an outstanding figure among them. The reporter will briefly report what he knows to the readers for encouragement.

In a general meeting speech, Mr. Lin Peisheng mentioned the fall of Guangzhou, and he was moved to tears,慷慨激昂, and his enthusiasm touched everyone's heart. He not only regretted that most of his property was destroyed in the artillery fire in one day, but also earnestly encouraged his compatriots to contribute money and effort to avenge this deep hatred! Mr. Lin firmly believes in the alert elders saying: "When the skin is gone, where can the hair attach?" "When the nest is overturned, how can there be intact eggs?" At the "July 7th" Lugouqiao Incident, Mr. Lin served as the chairman of the Guangzhou United Association and donated 500 yuan first, and then immediately raised more than 10,000 yuan. When the central government issued national salvation bonds, Mr. Lin again heard the news and gathered a meeting to subscribe for 500 yuan, declaring that he would not take back the bond certificates. The whole audience responded, and another 20,000 yuan was raised. Zhou Shouchen, the chairman of the bond association, once replied with a letter of commendation, praising him as the pioneer of bond purchases in Hong Kong. After that, Mr. Lin resumed long-term bond purchases of 100 yuan per month. At that time, the public opinion of moving the rent to purchase bonds was very popular. Mr. Lin was the first to fulfill it, using all of his monthly rent of 600 yuan to purchase bonds. Public opinion unanimously praised him as a model landlord. When the Guangdong National Defense Bonds were issued, he was also the first to hold a meeting, personally subscribing for 500 yuan, and the group also subscribed for several hundred yuan. Last spring, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce organized a debt collection team for the disaster relief association. Mr. Lin was one of the standing committee members, serving as the team leader of the first team, leading all the members of the Guangzhou United Chamber of Commerce to raise more than 17,000 yuan, winning the championship of the formal team. Last June, the Hong Kong Federation of All Circles for Relief of South China Refugees was established. Mr. Lin was elected as a standing director with the qualifications of the director of Tung Wah Hospital. He was responsible for the investigation group and the relief group. Last year's "July 7th" commemorative flower sale, he was responsible for working in the mother association, raising funds, half of which was used to relieve refugees, and half of which was used to purchase Guangdong bonds. In addition, the Overseas Chinese Daily Newspaper代廣州紅十字會劝募救护车,开会通过出资半数，与其他社团合购一辆.

Until the "August 13th" Incident, he first advocated the donation movement at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, and the Guangzhou United Chamber of Commerce began to launch it. He generously donated 1,000 yuan at the meeting, and the whole audience was excited. People scrambled to subscribe, and more than 5,000 yuan was obtained in the item. As a result, a total of 12,000 yuan was raised, which was the prelude to the donation in Hong Kong. After that, the donation movement was quite enthusiastic, and the results exceeded one million yuan, creating a feat for Hong Kong overseas compatriots, directly "September 18th" Ning National Defense Bond Purchase Movement. He repurchased 500 yuan, and the mother association 1,500 yuan. The donation movement was also the first advocate that Mr. Lin fulfilled, donating the interest earned from the face value of more than 1,000 yuan back to the central government, and further advocating and passing it in the mother association to donate national bonds back to the government and Guangdong prices to convenience hospitals. This time, the National Salvation Bond Raising Committee Hong Kong Branch launched a campaign to purchase public bonds, and Mr. Lin again declared on the spot that he would first purchase 1,000 yuan of salvation bonds to promote it.

We express our respect for Mr. Xiu's enthusiasm, and hope to continue to contribute money and effort to the country, and hope that the local tycoons and wealthy businessmen will not give way. "When the skin is gone, where can the hair attach?" "When the nest is overturned, how can there be intact eggs?" There is no doubt about it. What is "honor"? What is "shame"? It is entirely up to oneself. Let us, on the eve of the final victory, break through the hardships of this moment, from top to bottom, contribute money and effort to unleash the climax of "July 7th" donations, flower sales, and vegetarian meals.

### Coping with the Situation in the Far East: British and French Merchant Ships Armed for Self-Defense; British Giant Ships Modified with Deck-Mounted Gun Positions; the Two Countries Will Jointly Hold Naval Exercises in the Near Future

The highest military authorities of Britain and France stationed in the Far East recently held a summit meeting in Singapore, exchanged opinions on protecting the colonies in the Far East, and decided to jointly hold military exercises in the near future. All exercise preparations are being actively planned. A large number of military equipment from Britain has been transported to Singapore for assembly. Regarding the requisition of workers, the local naval dockyard authorities in Hong Kong have sent three batches of Chinese workers to Singapore for work last month. The fourth batch of eighty people is scheduled to take the Dicihua wheel to Singapore on July 1. There will also be a fifth batch of Chinese workers who will continue to set off.

Chinese Sappers Transferred to Singapore to Serve

These Chinese engineer soldiers are recruited in Hong Kong. After training, they are assigned to various parts of the naval and fortress troops, undertaking electrical, mechanical, carpentry, and other projects. Those who initially join the army receive a daily salary of 7.5角, which is divided into five grades to rise to a daily salary of 2元. There are also various allowances issued. It was heard yesterday that some of those sent to Singapore must stay in Singapore to serve, and Hong Kong must recruit hundreds more to supplement them.

British Ships in the Far East Begin Arming

The armed merchant ship plan was decided long ago by the British Naval Department. Now, with the situation in the Far East becoming increasingly urgent, it has been decided to implement it in the Far East, first equipping the giant ships traveling in the Far East with cannons, such as Da'ao Post ships and Blue Funnel giant ships. Their decks have all been transformed, and the four pillars of the cannon positions have also been properly equipped. As for the preparation of gun doors, ammunition, and other items, there are all appropriate preparations. Medium-sized merchant ships may not be armored. The main project is only to dismantle the cabin space under the rudder house and configure column frames behind the crane under the foremast to resist the recoil of the cannon barrel. The work is simple and convenient. All major shipyards in Hong Kong can carry out the construction. At the time of construction, the official forces are keeping it secret. What is known is that with full preparation, the project is very rapid. If fully installed, 70% of all British ships can be armed. Also, it was found that during the European War, only one cannon was equipped on merchant ships, and each was limited to an angle, and the shooting failed. Now, two guns are equipped separately on the left and right. Generally, medium-sized merchant ships can be equipped with 7.5- or upper-life short-range guns, and large ones can be equipped with 12- or 15-life medium-range guns. The completion of the armament of merchant ships indirectly increases the naval strength a lot.

French Giant Ships Also Install Gun Positions

It is also heard that the French are also proceeding with the arming of merchant ships, each constructing on its own, and obtaining design and coordination with Britain, so that when they are used uniformly, they will not be divergent. Most of the French ships sailing to the Far East are giant ships of more than 10,000 tons, and when necessary, they can also be incorporated into the navy and used as special auxiliary ships.

### Xijiang Youth Association Actively Carries Out Preparatory Work

Recently, in order to seek to connect with emotions and establish close ties with groups in various parts of Xijiang, overseas Chinese youth in Hong Kong have convened a preparatory meeting convened by initiators Su Qide, Liang Zhenqiu, etc., and elected responsible persons for each department on the spot to actively carry out work. It is planned to hold another preparatory meeting in the near future to formulate a draft charter, expand solicitation, and decide on future work guidelines. In order to facilitate the progress of the work, a communication office is specially set up at 106 Wusong Street, Yau Ma Tei, 4th floor, Yunfu Township Association, and communication offices will be set up separately.

### After the Frantic Bombing, They Were Burned and Killed Again: The Tragic Situation of Muxhou under Attack; Although the Troops Landed, They Did Not Dare to Go Deep; Many Western Ships and Ferries Dared to Stop Sailing

(Xijiang Express News) For more than half a month, the troops in the lower reaches of the Xijiang River have continued to invade Muxhou, Sanjiang and other places. The Muxhou team fiercely resisted and repelled the stubborn troops every time. The troops held deep resentment and, starting on the 24th of this month, changed their harassment strategy, using shallow-water boats to cruise around every day, firing cannons at the shore from a distance. At about 3:00 pm on the 26th, a shallow-water boat, along with more than 20 armored speedboats, carrying more than 200 soldiers, some of whom were fake advance teams, sailed to the waters of Muxhou, first bombing the shore with dense artillery fire, gradually approaching, covering up the landing of the troops. The local team immediately rose up to fight, advancing one after another.

Troops Burn and Kill Rampantly After Landing

Holding on until about 4:00 pm, the troops did not succeed. Six aircraft were dispatched in two teams, one team flew to Sanjiang Township, dropping seven or eight bombs to prevent our reinforcements, and the other team assisted in the battle over Luzhou, dropping killing bombs and strafing machine guns. Our team refused to allow the troops to land on one side and fired machine guns on both sides with dual-purpose machine guns. The aircraft did not dare to fly low and continued to drop bombs at high altitude. Our team finally had no reinforcements and had to retreat. The troops then poured in,掃射 the villages with machine guns, rushing in to rob and set fire to houses. The old and weak who could not escape in time were killed if they were not burned to death. The situation was very tragic.

The Troops Did Not Go Deep, and Ferries Suspended Service

By nightfall, our team had contacted the reinforcements and immediately gathered to advance, monitoring the troops. Upon receiving the report, the troops and fake troops robbed and killed for a while and did not dare to go deep. A part of them returned to the ships and showed signs of retreat. Our team took the opportunity to attack. It was found that Sanjiang was bombed on that day, and the losses were still slight. However, most of the ferries traveling in the Xijiang River passed through Muxhou. On that day, all the ferries heard the news and returned, and the ferry from Sanfu to Macau was suspended at the same time.

### Qiao'ao Highway: Cars Stop and Go

(Central Express News) Zhongshan continues to destroy highways, especially the Qiguan Road destruction is thorough. Kaiqiguan Company intends to temporarily suspend the traffic on the Macau-Shiqi line on the first day of next month, but the Zhanhe Station will still run.

### Who Caused It? Troops in Qiongdao Committed Suicide in Groups

(Nanlu Express News) Qiongdao has many mountains and ridges, and it is difficult for the troops to fight. Moreover, most of them do not adapt to the climate and are often infected with diseases, so the anti-war sentiment is even higher. Although the leaders have actively taken precautions, they have not been effective. Most of the newly transferred troops to Haikou are also homesick and tired of war. On the 18th of this month, seven soldiers went missing. The officers thought they were intercepted and killed by our guerrillas and sent troops to search in all directions, only to find them hanging themselves in groups in the deep mountains. Although the leaders tried their best to conceal the incident and prohibit publicity, the incident has spread throughout the army, and the morale of the army is extremely shaken.

### The Troops Invaded Huaxian County Town; Our Army Inflicted Heavy Damage on the Troops South of the City; Annihilated More Than 200 Troops and Took Advantage of the Victory to Attack Longkou; Once Entered the Market and Destroyed Several Warehouses

(Beijiang Express News) Troops in Conghua and Huaxian County in northern Guangdong have recently tried to stir up trouble again. On the 26th and 27th, they launched a large-scale invasion of Lianglong, Tianhe and other places. Along the Tianhe line, they tried to invade Huaxian County Town. A fierce battle took place with our army in the area south of the city. The battle situation is as follows:

Troops Defeated in the Battle of Huaxian

The Troops in Longkou Village, Huaxian County, have recently frequently reinforced and stirred up trouble. For the past week, they have repeatedly spied on Lianglong and other towns southwest of Huaxian County. After the troops failed to invade Shiba Ridge on the 25th, on the morning of the 27th, 600 or 700 troops from Longkou Village harassed them in two ways. One way was more than 500 people invading Tianhe Town south of Huaxian County, and the other way was more than 200 people, who窜至Lianglong Town at 12:00 noon. Our army Peng Shishi immediately迎击 in two ways. It was found that the troops invading Tianhe tried to continue to harass Huaxian City under the cover of artillery fire. Our army pre-ambushed in the mountains around Huaxian and other places, and when the troops arrived, they attacked from both sides. The battle situation was fierce for a time. Until noon, our position stood still, and the troops were wounded and killed. Holding on for six or seven hours, our army became more and more courageous and attacked the troops. The troops could not hold on and退退 from the original road to Longkou Longxiang. Abandoned a lot of military equipment. The troops who were harassing Lianglong were also defeated by Peng Shishi. A total of 200 people were annihilated in this battle, and countless military supplies were seized.

Our Army Advanced and Attacked Longkou

On the 25th and 26th, our army in Huaxian County continued to advance southward, forcing an attack on Longkou. Thousands of troops stubbornly resisted. It was found that the troops had been spying on our positions for several days and were痛击. The soldiers had no fighting spirit, and their morale was extremely颓丧. Our army took advantage of the victory to advance and attacked Longkou on the evening of the 26th, and fought with the troops at night. Our team of plainclothes mixed into the market in the dim light of night, as if they were responding from the inside. Attacking the troops from the front and back, the action was extremely agile. The troops were caught off guard and immediately used the machine to grab steel cannons to form a fire net, densely bombarding each other, and fighting each other for three or four hours. Our mission was completed and we withdrew safely. In this battle, more than 20 troops were annihilated, and more than ten short guns were seized, and several warehouses were destroyed. The troops suffered huge losses in food and machinery.

Taipingchang Troops Harass Center Ridge

In addition, the troop positions in Shengang Taipingchang along the Cong line have been busy transferring troops for days, plotting to invade the eastern line of Paitan. On the 25th, more than 100 troops in Taipingchang crossed the river from Mayazhuang and harassed the area around Center Ridge, forcibly pulling strong men, and searching for guns and ammunition stored by our guerrillas and the people. It was detected by a unit of our Conghua guerrillas and launched an attack on the troops. The troops resisted with arms, but we were outnumbered and did not dare to fight. After one hour of engagement, the troops could not hold on and狼狈 退退 toward Youpingchang, leaving behind several corpses and many guns and machinery. Our army did not pursue them.

### A Happy Thing: Troops and Puppet Blood Splattered in Saihualou in Southwest China; While Looking for Fun, They Suddenly Encountered Our Army Coming; The Brothel Was Set on Fire, and Many Troops Were Killed

(Xijiang Express News) In order to "suppress" the lurking guerrillas in the nearby townships, the troops stationed in Sanshui Southwest recently implemented a large-scale and strict search. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifice, our guerrillas had already retreated to a certain place. On the 22nd of this month, the puppet traitors of the Southwest Pseudo-Maintenance Association took the opportunity to ingratiate themselves with the troops and held a so-called "victory celebration." They set up a banquet at the Southwest Yanle Restaurant to celebrate the leaders of the troops. After the meeting dispersed at about 9:00 pm that night, they went to the Saihualou brothel in Haibang Street to find pleasure. More than 30 troops were stationed nearby. The incident was detected by our plainclothes investigation team lurking in the southwest town and reported to our guerrillas. A team of more than 30 people was first dispatched, all disguised as ordinary merchants, and mixed into the southwest town. Another team of more than 40 people, disguised as merchants and egg people, took six or seven small boats, disguised as carrying goods and vegetables, and sailed to the Haibang Road coast near the southwest in advance. At about 1:00 am in the middle of the night, they rushed into the Saihualou brothel on Haibang Street and threw grenades fiercely. The troops and puppets in the village did not have time to escape because our guerrillas came suddenly, drew their guns to resist, and鳴警笛 for help. Our guerrillas also fought back while setting fire. For a while, the fire was blazing, illuminating afar. Because the time had passed for too long, our guerrillas were afraid that the troops would rush to the scene, so they left separately. When they were about to leave, they also distributed leaflets and slogans, advising our merchants not to be fooled and deceived by the troops, and alerting the puppets to turn over a new leaf. It was found that in this battle, in addition to destroying the brothel, our guerrillas also burned to death more than ten officers and soldiers, and killed several traitors, such as Ma, Jiang, and Huang. Statistically, about 20 soldiers, puppets, and prostitutes were killed or injured in this battle.

### Passing and Shooting in Water Polo

— Pan Congshao

Playing water polo is a very interesting sport in the summer. Playing ball on land already requires a lot of energy, and swimming is also a strenuous sport. Playing water polo is enjoyable despite its difficulties, there is no doubt.

The first prerequisite for playing water polo is learning freestyle swimming. Playing water polo without being proficient in freestyle swimming makes it feel clumsy and awkward to control the ball, and it is easy to get flustered and taken advantage of when holding and grabbing the ball. To address this problem, water polo players need to focus on practicing freestyle swimming. This is obvious.

The size and weight of a water polo ball fall between those of a football and a basketball. Unless pressure is applied, it will not sink in the water. Whether floating or swimming, the action of passing the water polo ball using the hands to move it in the water, making the ball bounce, is much easier than simply holding the ball and throwing it with one arm across the water. Learning to pass the ball is easy with the former method. It is particularly important to note that the receiver must pay attention.

It is difficult to hold the ball with one hand without practice, and it is also difficult to throw it accurately. Even if you can throw the ball, it is difficult to throw it far if you don't hold it firmly, no matter how strong you are. The technique for holding the ball is to clamp it in the angle formed by the bend of the wrist. Needless to say, it is easier for people with long limbs and fingers to hold the ball. Long fingers are very helpful just for holding the ball, but the action of holding the ball to throw it is not that simple.

At the beginning of holding the ball, the hand is attached to the ball, and the water surface is below the ball. To start throwing, push the ball back to use the arm strength. There are different ways to push it back, either lifting it up and pushing it back or sliding it across the water. Generally speaking, sliding it across the water is easier. When pushing the ball back, regardless of how far it is pushed back, this is the first half of the throwing motion. In the second half of the motion, use arm strength to lift the ball out of the water and throw it forward. At this time, you need to hold the ball firmly and float very high on the water. Holding the ball firmly has already been mentioned above. Below, a brief explanation of floating will be given. (To be continued)

### Southern Tour Diary

— Chen Dehui

Our South China Athletic Association has always sent teams to Annam and various parts of Southeast Asia after each football season to learn from the strong teams there and to connect with overseas Chinese. This achieves multiple goals at once, and the intention and method are both excellent. Last year, it was hindered by other factors and could not be carried out. This year, considering that our country will definitely send a team to participate in the World Games next year, we must resolutely proceed despite all difficulties in order to prepare in advance and avoid becoming complacent and lazy.

On the 31st of last month, our team of athletes set off on the French postal ship "Guangdong." The group of twenty were all outstanding individuals whose names have already been announced, so there is no need to repeat them. However, our team's soul, Mr. Li Huitang, was unable to accompany the team on the expedition due to vacation issues. Defender Zhao Han was also unable to depart due to an unhealed foot injury, and Shi You also did not depart due to other reasons. Both attack and defense were affected. However, since the plan had already been decided, the itinerary could not be hindered by small matters.

Waves rise and fall, and towels are like snow. The sound of the whistle is like a farewell song. Goodbye, Hong Kong! Goodbye, friends! Although we are only leaving for a few months, the green fields, the long pavilion, and the southern shore are situations that my clumsy pen cannot describe in detail.

Now that the ship has set sail and everything is settled, I will take this opportunity to write a Southern Tour diary for our friends and comrades. The reason for the delayed publication is that Luo Jun Douwen was originally scheduled to be responsible for it. However, Luo Jun was slow to take action, and team leader Mo was too busy to supervise, resulting in the delay. It was only after arriving in Singapore that I was ordered to be solely responsible. Since my writing is poor and I am busy, and half a month has passed since the departure, although I am trying my best, the matter is a retrospective account, and there will inevitably be some discrepancies. I hope the readers will understand and not blame me for the delay.

June 1st

In the morning, we passed through the Seven Islands Ocean. The wind and waves were quite strong, and very few people had breakfast. Shi Jin and others were even more dizzy. That night, "Fatty Qi" cooked chicken porridge for his colleagues with seven Hong Kong dollars. Guangsen sang songs to celebrate, and Douwen played the Beijing fiddle to accompany him. Although it was not a tragic song of farewell, it was still a moment of joy.

I remember that Mr. Douwen once sent a draft of travel anecdotes, which was very detailed. I think it is already well known to the readers, so there is no need to repeat it here.

June 2nd

I woke up to find the sky already bright. The ship was moving slowly, indicating that we had already entered the Tuishan Estuary. Leaning on the railing and looking into the distance, the plains stretched as far as the eye could see. Among the short trees, there were occasional short houses and sparse fences, hidden deep in the greenery. The scenery of the fields washed away the dust and worries, and the hardships of the journey were forgotten. In the morning, the ship docked, and there were many welcomers. The athletes of the Eastern Association, Zeng Peifu and Song Lingsheng, also appeared in the crowd. When we disembarked, they took care of everything. On the way, we met Mr. Guan Zhuo, the manager of the Hong Kong Leighton Automobile Company, and went to his hotel to rest. Mr. Guan was very kind and provided lunch, feasting on the entire team. We had not eaten since morning and were able to satisfy our hunger. It was a truly happy event. After the meal, we took a train to Hanoi. Mr. Guan Chiheng, the head of the Hanoi community, guided us through everything and took us to the World Hotel as a temporary base. Team leader Mo, considering that tomorrow would be the first battle after the expedition, forbade all team members from going out at night in order to conserve energy and overcome the strong enemy. So, all the team members went to bed to rest.

June 3rd

After a good night's sleep, we were full of energy. In the morning, Team Leader Mo, Secretary Zhou, and Captain Bao gathered to discuss today's lineup in order to cope with the Hanoi champion team. The result was the following lineup:

Bao Jiaping, Li Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng, Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Guo Yingqi, Luo Douwen, Li Zhaorong, Chen Dehui, Liu Songsheng, Yang Shuiyi

Once the general plan was set, we went to the airport to pick up Liang Jun Rongzhao, because Liang was unable to accompany us on the day of departure due to some matter. He caught a plane and rushed to the front line this morning. After 11:00, the shadow of the plane appeared in the sky and immediately landed on the field. After meeting, we packed our luggage and returned to the base camp by car. After lunch, we rested briefly and then set off in battle attire. By the time we arrived at the stadium, the streets were packed with people. The spectators were extremely crowded. Both teams were lined up and the battle began. The enemy's defense was tight, and it was difficult to make progress. Therefore, we only won by a small margin of one to zero in the first half. After the lemon break, our athletes worked exceptionally hard, beheading generals and seizing passes, advancing bravely and without hesitation, capturing five cities in a row. The enemy's commander was frightened and unable to counterattack. Finally, we defeated them by a score of six to zero. Those who scored goals were Zhaorong, Songsheng, Shuiyi, and myself. It was an unexpected gain.

June 4th

This afternoon, the team attacked the Hanoi players team. I remember that we had previously lost to them, as they were a strong enemy. The lineup for today was as follows:

Bao Jiaping, Li Tiansheng, Hou Rongsheng, Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Guo Yingqi, Luo Douwen, Li Zhaorong, Chen Dehui, Feng Jingxiang, Deng Guangsen

After lunch, many team members took a walk to aid digestion. Some were writing letters at their desks. The representative of the Haiphong Sports Association visited at this time, saying that the people of Haiphong were very willing to learn from us. Although team leader Mo believed that too many matches would tire the players too much and intended to decline the offer, it was impossible to reject their earnest request. Therefore, he agreed, as the main purpose of our Southern Tour was not about winning or losing. When the time for the match arrived, we took a car to the stadium. Today's audience was almost double that of yesterday. Although we were in a car, it still took us quite a while to drive in. The atmosphere was lively and beyond description. The referee summoned the captains of both sides, emphasizing courtesy before battle. Our seven horses were full of vigor and determination. The enemy army was trembling with fear, and the first half was scoreless. In the second half, the competition was even fiercer. Our side advanced and retreated properly, and our strategy was superior. I and Douwen each scored three goals, resulting in a score of six to zero. We wiped out our previous shame. However, both I and Zhaorong were injured in the legs due to the intense battle.

June 5th

Today, according to the agreement with the Haiphong Sports Association, the entire team packed their luggage after breakfast and took the "Adora" – that is, the tram, which the locals call "Adora" – to Haiphong. We arrived after two sentences. Shi Lingsheng and the representatives had been waiting for a long time. After arriving in Haiphong, we temporarily stayed at the Botumei Hotel. Among the team members, only Shi Jin was unwell and stayed in Hanoi. According to the doctor, Mr. Zhuo should not engage in strenuous exercise, and it would be better for him to return to Hong Kong. Team leader Mo believed that our team did not have many warriors, and Shi Jin's departure would affect our strength even more. Fortunately, Mr. Song Lingsheng volunteered to join our team for the Southern Tour, which could still maintain our original combat capabilities. Mr. Song also participated in today's battle.

The field at the Haiphong Stadium was barren, with grass growing over the ankles. The ball often bounced erratically because of it. After the start of the game, the captains of each team said that the grass was too long and they could not fully exert their abilities. The enemy took advantage of the situation and scored first. After some struggle and desperate counterattack by our army, the enemy's defender staged a strange drama of defecting in the midst of heavy encirclement, resulting in a tie. Then, center Feng Jingxiang scored a goal with a header, making it two to one at the end of the first half. In the second half, each team attacked and defended. Unfortunately, near the end of the game, our defender was careless and gave the opponent's center forward a chance to recover, resulting in a two-to-two tie. After the game, we returned to the hotel and returned to Hanoi at eight o'clock that night. The next day, we took the road to Saigon. The lineup for today was as follows:

Zhang Rongcai

Li Guoqi Li Dasheng (Up) He Rongsheng (Down)

Guo Yingqi (Up) Tan Zhen (Down) Liu Cai Song Lingsheng

Luo Douwen (Up) Yang Shuiyi (Down) Li Zhaole Feng Jingxiang Liu Songsheng Deng Guangsen
