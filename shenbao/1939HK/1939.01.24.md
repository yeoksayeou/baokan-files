### The Japanese Military Clique's Fear

Since the Japanese invaders demanded that the world's nations recognize the so-called "New Order in East Asia" that it had forcibly created, and received strong rebuttals from the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, not only have Japanese politicians and bureaucrats heard of this and become greatly alarmed, but even the frenzied and unrestrained Japanese military clique has also become terrified. The spiritual and economic sanctions against Japan by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, due to the active advocacy of the United States, have gradually been put on the agenda for implementation. This is what we have repeatedly discussed in our articles over the past month. Recently, U.S. President Roosevelt has also submitted a bill to Congress, requesting the construction and arming of twelve new naval bases, including Guam, Midway Island, Wake Island, major ports in Alaska and Florida, as well as Hawaii and Puerto Rico. In particular, the construction of Guam is even more active. The Japanese military circles have heard of this and are very alarmed. The Ministry of the Navy has recently issued a booklet, and reading its contents reveals its flustered and hurried state. However, after examining the situation from all aspects, this is not without reason.

The Japanese Ministry of the Navy's booklet first states that Japan is currently facing a major crisis, namely, that Japan must cope with the combined forces of the British, American, French, and Soviet navies; these four countries are using their strong naval power as a backing for China's resistance against Japan. The booklet also stated that "if Japan wants to build a new order in the Far East, it now has difficulties both at sea and on land" (according to a dispatch from Tokyo on the 20th). These are the honest words of the Japanese invaders. Japan is an island nation, and since the middle of the Meiji period, it has been renowned in the world for its navy. Its several external wars of aggression have certainly relied most on the army, but the role of the navy has also occupied an important position. For example, there have been repeated operations by naval landing forces. Subsequently, as its international dangers gradually expand into the stage of World War II, the importance of its navy will increase even more. The Japanese military clique originally planned to use the army to deal with China and the Soviet Union, and the navy to deal with the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. In the past ten years, Japan has actively expanded its navy to the maximum limit of the naval treaty, while the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have slightly relaxed their military preparedness, which has led Japan to believe that its army and navy are sufficient to run rampant in the world. However, in recent years, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, in view of the increasingly tense situation in the Pacific and Europe, have rapidly caught up in terms of naval equipment; especially in the Pacific, they have built solid naval bases, such as the Soviet Union's in Vladivostok, the United Kingdom's in Singapore, France's in Annam, and the United States' in the Philippines, etc. When the naval forces of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union are fully equipped, they will not only be an overwhelming force for Japan, but also form a surrounding situation for it. This is just as the Japanese Ministry of the Navy's booklet says, the United States' naval plan is enough to make the United States the most alarming naval nation in the world, the United Kingdom's naval plan will allow the United Kingdom to create a naval force of two million tons by 1942, and the Soviet Union's submarine fleet is the largest in the world.

The construction of the strong naval forces of the four civilized nations of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union is entirely aimed at defending against aggressive nations that deliberately disrupt world peace, especially targeting Japanese imperialism, which has been running rampant in the Pacific in recent years. Therefore, the recent naval construction of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union has coincided in concentrating on the Pacific. Recently, there have been two facts that have further alarmed Japan. The first is the Soviet Union's naval equipment. After the "September 18th Incident," Japan focused all its energy on the connection between the Japanese archipelago and the Chinese mainland, so it invested huge sums to reform the ports of western Japan, open up new ports in northern Korea, and shorten the sea route from important mainland cities to Japan. Since the successful construction of Rajin, Chongjin, and Unggi ports, Japan's efforts have achieved considerable success. However, this achievement will be completely eliminated in the future due to the activities of the Soviet Union's strong "submarine fleet" in Vladivostok (according to the above-mentioned booklet, the Soviet Union has designated 60 ships for use in the Far East). The Soviet Union is not satisfied with the "world's largest submarine fleet," and it will also "build two 35,000-ton battleships and seven 8,000-ton cruisers" (above-mentioned booklet). It is an extremely difficult task for Japan to seize Vladivostok.

Second, the United States' construction of new naval bases in the Pacific poses an even greater threat to Japan. Japan deeply knows the importance of the Pacific in the future world war, so after the European War, it insisted on seizing the South Seas Mandate. The several islands of Japan's South Seas Mandate originally had no economic value, but Japan strived to obtain them, and its significance lies in the military, because these islands are located in the middle of the Pacific, and to the north, they can be connected to Japan's mainland by the Ogasawara Islands as a bridge, and to the west, they can be connected to its colony of Taiwan, so that its naval power can be exerted in the Pacific. However, the United States' subsequent rapid construction of naval bases not only adopted a surrounding shape for Japan's entire naval base, but also prepared to build Guam to directly attack the heart of this naval base. Guam is located in the middle of Japan's South Seas Mandate, about 1,500 miles from eastern Japan and the Philippines. If the United States' naval construction in the Philippines and Guam is successful, it will be enough to destroy the connection between Japan and the South Seas Mandate, then Japan's naval power will not only be greatly reduced, but also have the possibility of being blockaded near the three islands of Japan, and several large cities on Japan's land will be bombed by the planes of various countries, eventually leading to collapse.

As British naval experts have said: "The victory or defeat of future wars depends on the strength of the navy" (London Daily Telegraph). The prediction that the Japanese military clique will inevitably be defeated has gained a new argument.

### The Experience of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region in Crushing the Enemy's Encirclement - A General's Remarks

(1) Full Preparation and Calm, Resolute Response

First, the border region has made full preparations to oppose the enemy's encirclement. They know that the border region was produced, grew, and became solid under the enemy's encirclement. Before the Japanese invaders are driven out of China, the enemy will not forget to attack the border region for a moment. Especially as the border region expands and consolidates, and continues to achieve military victories, the harm and threat to the enemy increase, the enemy will not give up its attempts to "mop up" the border region. Therefore, they believe that in the process of the border region's consolidation, development, and continuous victories, even if the regime becomes increasingly consolidated, all construction is on track, and social order and local security are gradually restored, it still cannot be considered a "long-term and stable" "comfortable nest." Therefore, they constantly raise their vigilance, preparing to respond to the enemy's attack at any time, and actively attack the enemy. They have repeatedly put forward slogans such as "oppose the concept of peace" and "everything is suitable for the war environment" to raise public awareness and not be麻醉 by temporary peace. At the same time, all work and daily life in the border region are carried out under the slogans of tension, speed, hard work, depth, practicality, planning, and swiftness, all suitable for the war environment. Ready to respond to the enemy's new offensive at any time. Therefore, generally speaking, when the enemy launched a large-scale offensive against the border region this time, the people, regime, army, and all social organizations in the border region were able to calmly and resolutely take all steps to oppose the enemy's counterattack, neither panicking and losing control, wavering, or running away, nor being pessimistic and disappointed.

(2) Correct Leadership and Solid Unity

Second, is correct leadership and solid unity. From the beginning of the establishment of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, and in the struggle over the past year, work has been carried out under the correct general policy of the anti-Japanese national united front, uniting every border region people who are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation. They deeply understand the truth that "at this time of national crisis, the more urgent the situation, the more united the anti-Japanese forces of our entire nation must be, which is the central key to saving the situation." In the past year, all the people, regime, army, and various parties in the border region have been working together with one heart and one mind, fighting together under the central task of consolidating and expanding the anti-Japanese base areas. There is generally little "friction" between them, and even less "those close to us grieve, those who hate us rejoice" incidents occur. Although the enemy has never given up its "scheme of using Chinese to control Chinese; creating rumors, provoking separation, organizing puppet organizations, fabricating facts, framing the border region regime and army, expelling traitors and bandits from the border region, carrying out various schemes, attempting to split the unity of the border region people, regime, and army, this attempt has been defeated under the solid unity of the border region people, regime, and army. At the same time, in the past year, the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region has indeed done a lot of great work. Under the principle of "resistance against Japan is above all else," the political institutions have undergone relatively proper reforms, and democratic politics, improvement of people's livelihood, and national crisis education have generally been realized, thereby further enhancing the determination of the broad masses and the army to resist Japan, and the confidence to adhere to a protracted war and strive for final victory. At the same time, it has also increasingly increased the people's support and love for the regime, and mutual unity, especially manifested in times of war urgency, and in the face of large-scale encirclements, although the enemy has made full preparations, political mobilization, and tried every possible means to split the unity of the border region, and after entering the border region, searched everywhere for the masses to "publicize," and even used money to buy them off, attempting to crudely organize "maintenance associations," but they have never been able to establish them. The activities of traitors within the border region are extremely weak.

(3) Using Combined Assaults to Crush the Enemy's "Divided Advance and Combined Attack"

Third, is the dynamic tactics of our troops. The border region troops have adopted guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare in their operations against the enemy's encirclement. The terrain conditions and the people's conditions in the border region are very favorable to the border region army's operations. When the enemy began to advance on a large scale towards the center of the border region from all directions, the border region's troops skillfully launched separate突擊 against the enemy invading the border region. More than 4,000 enemy troops advancing from Yuxian County to Kewuhe were迎擊 by our powerful unit in the areas of Bailanquanxia Gengjiazhuang, etc., and fought bloody battles for four days and nights, killing or wounding about 2,000 enemy troops, including the Shimizu Regiment Commander. The enemy advancing toward　Qiu from Guang灵 was阻击 by another unit of our army in the Zhigukou Fengjiawan area, and fought fiercely for six days and nights, killing more than 800 enemy troops. More than 500 enemy troops advancing from Yixian County to Laiyuan were attacked by our army in the Wangan area, and completely annihilated. When the enemy entered the border region, although they occupied certain towns and transportation hubs, the enemy's attempt to wipe out our active forces by "dividing and attacking" completely failed. That is, in the end, the "mopping up" from Wutai, Fuping, and Taihuai towards Gengzhen and Shizui, in addition to suffering constant attacks and casualties along the way, abandoning corpses and wounded soldiers, and fleeing in a panic, also achieved nothing. Therefore, although the enemy's plan was meticulous and the means were毒辣, under the flexible maneuverability of our army and the opposition to the enemy's invasion by the entire people, even if the enemy penetrated deep into the border region and occupied certain cities, towns, and key roads, they still could not limit our maneuverability. On the contrary, the border region troops were still able to continue to strike at the enemy who had penetrated deep into various areas with ease and constantly achieve victories. At the same time, in the enemy's rear communication lines, powerful units and guerrillas of our army constantly appeared in their depths. The roads were destroyed, and the retreating troops did not dare to move because they were constantly attacked by our army. The enemy guarding the strongholds also did not dare to leave the strongholds because they were constantly raided and besieged by our army. The enemy's Regiment Commander Chongzheng Ya was killed by a sudden attack by our strike team in Sangshang Hunanjin, an area that had already been "mopped up" by the enemy. At the same time, the Zhengtai Road, Pinghan Road, PingSui Road, and Tongpu Road were also constantly destroyed by our army. As a result, the situation of the enemy and us changed, giving the enemy who encircled the border region and the enemy who divided and attacked a combined assault, so that the enemy who had penetrated deep into the border region had to give up the attempt to continue the offensive. This is excellent maneuverability, a characteristic of the strategic tactics in the War of Resistance Against Japan.

(4) Resolute and Protracted Operations Finally Threw the Enemy into the Fate of Losing Soldiers and Generals

Fourth, is the决打 against the enemy, the resolute protracted operation. The Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region only has a year of history of victory, and the border region armed forces are mostly organized from scattered people's armed organizations. Whether in equipment, training, or other aspects, there are shortcomings, but they have a high degree of political passion and heroic and resolute determination to fight; have unyielding perseverance, and a firm belief in achieving final victory. Therefore, when the enemy attacked the border region with a large force,毒辣 means, and fierce bombing by airplanes and artillery, the young army in our border region was not intimidated. Even when the enemy entered the border region, occupied some cities and towns, and the environment of the border region's struggle temporarily turned into a more serious state, the young border region armed forces remained as stable as Mount Tai, fighting resolutely. In the more than one hundred hard battles, large and small, in the past two months, although they failed to prevent the enemy from entering the border region and have not completely eliminated the enemy who entered the border region to this day, they have indeed made the enemy suffer great losses and sacrifices, sacrificing one brigadier commander, two team leaders, and about 20,000 other officers and soldiers, and finally completely crushed the enemy's plan to "mop up" the border region, throwing the enemy into the tragic fate of losing soldiers and generals.

(5) The Thorough Mobilization of the Masses Gave the Enemy a Great Threat

Fifth, the success of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region in crushing the enemy's large-scale encirclement this time is due to the in-depth mobilization of the masses. Because the people in the border region had made full war preparations in "normal times," the mobilization of the masses in this large-scale encirclement by the enemy was very high. Especially the work of emptying the houses and clearing the fields was even more universal and thorough. Food was buried, all tools that cost the enemy were also collected, and all businesses located on the road of the enemy's advance were far away, which gave the enemy great difficulties. They could not find supplies, nor could they find utensils, let alone the masses. They could not inquire about the situation of our army, and there was no one to lead the way. Puppet organizations could not be organized, which made the enemy isolated. Especially after the rear communication line was cut off, they could not last long. Although there are still shortcomings in the participation of the masses in the war, and there are also weaknesses in some work that are not enough for war connection, the general people of the border region have been actively mobilized. They actively and bravely participated in transporting wounded soldiers, transporting food, transporting victory items, and destroying roads: and many people, especially from the suicide squads, took up various kinds of white-blade weapons, or鸟枪士砲, and spontaneously and independently fought with the enemy, or cooperated with guerrillas, etc., scattered in various road　, fields, villages, or mountains, and fought irregular battles with the enemy, giving the enemy a great threat, especially giving them a great shock in spirit.

(6) General Administrative Institutions Can Still Play Their Role in the Encirclement

Sixth is in charge of the regime's work. In this time of the enemy's encirclement of the border region, the administrative efficiency of the border region was weakened due to the urgent war situation or the separation of the regime's connections by the enemy, and there were also a small number of districts and villages and two-level regimes that failed to play a proper role, and even无形解体, but generally speaking, they can still adapt to the war environment, especially the county administrative districts, which have the spirit and determination to fight hard and persevere in the struggle. Even under relatively serious circumstances, they can still carry out administrative work and lead the broad masses to cooperate in combat, or directly lead local armed forces to launch guerrilla warfare. This is indeed the direct result of the thorough reform of the political institutions. It is a world apart from those corrupt officials, 生怕死, and run away at the slightest sound. At the same time, this also proves that in order to maintain the proper effectiveness of the regime's work in the protracted war of resistance, it is only possible to thoroughly strengthen the reform of the political institutions.

(7) A Matter Worthy of Vigilance

Seventh, is something that we must　　. In the border region, there are ××　institutions　,　　after the battle, most of them disintegrated first, some　changed and投了 the enemy, some turned into bandits, and some panicked and fled. Everywhere搶劍民　　caused the old people to suffer a lot. The reason for this is that the organizational composition of these troops is extremely　　, the officers and soldiers　　have the necessary unity, no necessary discipline (or is打　主义) no any training, no minimal political work more no necessary anti-Japanese殺國敎育, so to　such troops, faithfully于抗日救國的伟业, is沒有保陣的. More 该不上 to require them in the bitter and difficult environment, break through and overcome all the困伟, in suffering on conduct坚　protracted war, adhere to strive for independent freedom happy new China. At the same time this also clearly shows　that any troop, if there is没有　good composition points, no necessary unity,没　necessary training, no necessary conscious discipline, no necessary political work, no necessary anti-Japanese救國敎育, to提高民族意识,克服一切不良现象, not only can not guarantee其忠实于抗日救國事业,坚持持久战,不顾一切艰苦困难,不届不挠,再接再励的为独立自出幸福的新中国而奋斗, 无须　经过×人的严重猛烈的进攻, 也要自己解体 或 转变 无或多或少的危害于民族解放事业的.

The above points are all General ××'s actual and brief observations to the reporter on the enemy's large-scale encirclement of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region and the crushing of the enemy's encirclement, but we can already clearly see from here: In this battle, the fighting methods of both the enemy and us have many contents. This is a new experience and lesson since the War of Resistance, and it is also an inevitable product of the increasingly protracted process of the War of Resistance. We must estimate that more new fighting methods will inevitably be produced in the continued development of the War of Resistance. Therefore, studying these experiences and lessons is an extremely meaningful and important thing for the national warriors who adhere to the protracted war, especially for those who adhere to the protracted war behind the enemy lines, prepare to continuously oppose the enemy's encirclement, defeat the enemy's continuous offensives and encirclements, and strive for final victory.

### Guangdong's Finances Stabilize, Personnel and Administrative Affairs Gradually Get on Track

[Lian County Correspondence] Since the reorganization of the Guangdong Provincial Government, the position of Director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance has been taken over by Gu Yiqun. Mr. Gu was originally the president of the Guangdong Provincial Bank and is an economic expert. In the future, Guangdong's finances will be managed by Mr. Gu's talents, and there will surely be achievements. The former director, Zeng Yangfu, initially commanded the tax police regiment in combat after the fall of Guangzhou, and later served as the director of the Xijiang Administrative Office of the Provincial Government. Recently, he was summoned to Chongqing by Generalissimo Chiang and will be appointed to a new position. The transfer of the department to the new appointee is said to be nearing completion. It is reported that the transfer currently includes more than four million yuan in national currency. During the War of Resistance, when expenditures are vast, it is rare to be able to manage so freely and still have such a large sum of surplus funds to transfer. The general public is quite skeptical about this and doubts how it came about. There are noteworthy points in this. Guangdong's finances have always been known to be chaotic. After the prohibition of opium and gambling, annual revenue has fallen short by tens of millions of yuan, which cannot be compensated for. When Director Song Ziliang took office, he felt extremely difficult. Then he resigned due to illness. The authorities believed that Mr. Zeng was rich in construction talent, so they appointed him to take over. At that time, outsiders doubted whether Mr. Zeng could overcome this difficulty. However, he did not hesitate and resolutely accepted the appointment, determined to reform. First, he exempted dozens of kinds of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies, and also exempted the old land tax from the 13th to the 23rd years of the Republic of China. Then he reorganized the　 revenue, and just as he was getting started, the War of Resistance broke out, and Guangdong's finances suddenly changed from normal to extraordinary, and a tense state was presented. Mr. Zeng was concerned about increasing the burden on the people on the one hand, and on the other hand, he had to deal with military expenses, so he urgently formulated a wartime financial plan. The basic principles were: (A) not increasing the burden on the people, (B) considering the national position, (C) carefully considering whether the revenue and expenditure of the finances themselves are suitable. The guidelines for its implementation, in terms of system, were: (1) establishing a tax bureau to manage tax administration in various places, (2) independent treasury to collect tax payments exclusively, (3) independent accounting to summarize the amount of revenue and expenditure, in terms of personnel, were: (1) selecting and training tax officials, (2)　dense assessment, (3) safeguarding good officials, (4) strictly punishing corruption, in terms of tax revenue, were: (1) abolishing contractors, (2) improving the old tax system, (3) establishing a wartime luxury goods surtax, (4) implementing a wartime business excess profits tax. After hard work and perseverance for more than a year, he was finally able to lay the foundation for Guangdong Province's wartime finances, and the people and administrative affairs gradually got on track. Revenue increased greatly, so in addition to meeting extraordinary needs, there was still a surplus of funds. Under this serious state, being able to manage in this way and achieve its effect is not to be said that Mr. Zeng's financial management was quite successful. Guangdong's finances have undergone a considerable foundation through this reform, and now that Mr. Gu has succeeded him,　 following the rules and innovating, there must be　reflections, so it can cope with the long-term War of Resistance. It is also what the people of the country and Guangdong are happy to hear. (Zhang)

### × Military Leaders Decide to Increase Troops in Central China, Feigning Offensive Against Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong

(Special dispatch from our Chongqing office, 23rd) It is reported that × army and navy generals, in a meeting in Nanjing, decided to reinforce the troops in Central China to fifteen divisions. The "Manchurian" and Korean armies will be transferred to Taiwan for training, with the intention of carrying out a "sweeping" operation against guerrillas in the future, protecting transportation lines, and feigning offensives against Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong to contain our forces, while at the same time carrying out indiscriminate bombings, attempting to disrupt our rear lines.

[Dispatch from our Shanghai office, 23rd] According to foreign news, the Japanese warlords are still determined to go their own way. They are currently organizing a new army of 180,000 men to invade Suiyuan. In the future, they will mostly advance in three routes, with the puppet Manchurian army as the vanguard, the Japanese army in the center, and the flanks led by Chinese generals of the puppet Manchurian army. Currently, there are already over 10,000 Japanese and puppet troops in Suiyuan, and a major battle is imminent.

[Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing, 23rd] According to Chinese military authorities speaking to our reporter, the Japanese army is sending reinforcements to Shanxi from Japan and puppet Manchuria. On the 15th of this month, the Japanese transported twelve 15 cm caliber field guns from Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan. These are heavy artillery pieces transported from the Japanese mainland. It is also said that the Japanese troops stationed in Taiyuan and Yuci have strengthened their defenses to prepare for sudden attacks by Chinese guerrillas. In small cities like Yuci, the Japanese troops stationed there now number 15,000. Chinese reports also indicate that several Italian military technical experts have arrived in Taiyuan from Japan. Furthermore, it is said that the Japanese 7th Division has now received orders to be the main force for the next invasion of southwestern Hebei, replacing the Nakajima Division, which was the main force for the previous invasion.

[Central News Agency dispatch from Hekou, 22nd] Puppet troops and × bandits are increasingly at odds. The puppet head, Zhi Chongyu, of the Qian Di Pi regiment, led a mutiny of the entire regiment a few days ago, killing a × commander and retreating east to Guyang. Furthermore, part of the puppet 18th Regiment was dissatisfied with × and has been disbanded.

[Central News Agency dispatch from Huaiyin, 23rd] Five hundred × soldiers of the Jiangyin × army mutinied a few days ago, killing the × commander, and engaged in widespread arson, murder, and looting. The people suffered a great calamity. Later, × troops were transferred from Wuxi to suppress the mutiny, and the rebellious soldiers were escorted onto ships and transported to Shanghai. It is reported that the cause of the mutiny was war-weariness, homesickness, arrears of pay, and internal strife.

### The Situation in Western Shanxi Turns Favorable; Our Forces Encircle and Control ×, Frequent Troop Movements on the Datong-Puzhou Railway Line

(Special dispatch from our Chongqing office, 23rd) The × forces in the occupied areas have been quite active recently. Our troops have launched guerrilla warfare and achieved considerable victories. The Jiangsu-Shandong × forces have taken no action. Traffic on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is sometimes blocked and sometimes open. The × forces in the counties of western Shanxi have adopted a defensive posture, and the fighting has slowed down compared to before. We are using encirclement and flanking tactics to control the × forces on all routes. The × forces on the Datong-Puzhou Railway are very busy with military transport. Fierce battles are raging near Hejin.

[Dispatch from our Xi'an office, 23rd] The × forces in Hejin are surrounded and are in a desperate struggle. All lines of communication have been cut off by us. The 24th and 108th Divisions will be annihilated soon. The × 1st, 109th, and 110th Divisions in the southern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, totaling a regiment, have been scattered after our counter-offensive.

[Min Ge She dispatch from Dianji, 23rd] There is no activity in Zhongyang and Lishi. In recent days, 500 × troops from Fenyang have been reinforced to Zhongli. They are all veterans aged 35 to 40. Among them are over 300 Chinese from Huaiping, and their weapons are very incomplete, with some even carrying spears. Desertions by private soldiers are reported daily.

[Min Ge She dispatch from Xingji, 23rd] There has been fierce fighting between × and our forces in the area of Yanbo Village between Wu'an and Handan. × suffered over 300 casualties and reinforcements were successively dispatched from Handan. Fighting is still ongoing.

[Min Ge She dispatch from Jingle, 23rd] (1) People from Hekou say that the situation in Taiyuan city is very uneasy. The puppet government has not paid salaries for three months, so morale is extremely low. In remote streets and alleys, incidents of Chinese people and × soldiers being killed by our people are frequently discovered. Our guerrillas are active within ten miles of the city. At night, clear gunfire can be heard in the city. (2) On the night of the 14th, our troops attacked Dongyezhen (south of Wutai), killing over ten × soldiers. The × forces are very frightened in the Hebian area.

[Special dispatch from our Shanghai office, 24th] The × forces in Puxi are very busy with troop movements. They have repeatedly launched attacks against our army in recent days, probing our strength. They have been repelled by our army's courageous resistance. Fierce battles are currently raging in Lishi and Zhongyang. Our army launches night attacks and captures many supplies.

[Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing, 23rd] According to a Chinese military spokesman speaking to our reporter, the Japanese military operations in the past four or five weeks to clear out the Chinese military forces in southern Hebei, western Hebei, and the area between the Fen River and the Yellow River have now failed. This is because the Chinese forces have defeated the Japanese forces and recaptured the strongholds at the Yellow River crossings such as Fugu and Yumen. The Chinese forces immediately recovered Jixian University and Xiangning and other places. The Japanese forces retreated to Lingshi, Puxian, Zhongyang and other counties. The Japanese invasion of Shaanxi two weeks ago was extremely tense and has now been relieved. At the same time, the victorious Chinese guerrillas have expanded eastward to the Datong-Puzhou Railway. However, the Japanese forces in Shanxi still plan to make efforts to advance into the above-mentioned cities in order to clear out the guerrillas. Therefore, the Japanese forces in Taiyuan are now concentrating five Japanese divisions and several Mongolian puppet divisions to attack the Chinese forces on the east bank of the Yellow River such as Jixian and Daning.

### The × Army Retreats from Jingshan

[Central News Agency dispatch from Fancheng, 22nd] After occupying Jingshan, the × forces advanced towards the Jingshan-Zhongxiang road. After our attack, they retreated towards Jingshan. We are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the × forces near Jingshan.

### × Plans to Land in Beihai and Invade Guangxi Province; × Troops Continuously Reinforce Weizhou Island; × Forces in Jiujiang Biding Their Time

[Special dispatch from our Wuzhou office, 23rd] The × forces in Guangdong province, considering the dangerous terrain and dense water mines of the West River, making it difficult to invade Wuzhou, and also considering changing their plan to Nanning, have been fiercely bombing the Qinzhou area northwest of Beihai in recent days. × warships and troop transports are also concentrated around Tuzhou Island, all signs of an invasion of Nanning. The reason why they have not launched yet is probably because the × cabinet is still undecided, and the weak military strength near Guangzhou also makes them dare not act rashly. Currently, the × mechanized units are mostly concentrated in Jiujiang, waiting for the right opportunity to move towards Kaiping, Sihui, Taishan, and Xinhui, because the terrain there is mostly flat and easy to maneuver.

[Central News Agency dispatch from Wengyuan, 23rd] More than 2,000 × troops have successively landed on Tuzhou Island. Every day, in groups of three to five, they go to villages to loot property and rape women. ×× above the age of twelve are not spared.

[Central News Agency dispatch from Sihui, 23rd] Our troops in Mafang occasionally cross the river to attack ×, who are uneasy and are building fortifications for defense in the area near Lan Gang in recent days.

[Foreign dispatch from Aomen Dou, 23rd] According to reliable information received here, several French warships have been ordered to sail from Haiphong to Guangzhou. It is also said that last night about ten Japanese gunboats were patrolling the port of Guangzhou. The French authorities are now trying to prepare for the Japanese to land near Guangzhou.

### × Ammunition Depot in Huangpi Destroyed by Our Bombing

[Central News Agency dispatch from Fancheng, 22nd] The Liuzhi area in southeastern Huangpi is where × stores ammunition. On the 13th, many of our aircraft went to bomb it. In addition to killing many × soldiers, all of the × ammunition was destroyed.

[Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing, 23rd] According to Chinese sources, yesterday sixteen Japanese bombers went to bomb northern Shaanxi. Yan'an, the location of the border region government, and Luochuan, on the Xi'an-Yan'an highway, were also bombed, killing over twenty civilians.

[Central News Agency dispatch from Huaiyin, 23rd] A squadron of our air force flew to Yangzhou on the morning of the 12th and dropped many bombs outside Nandou, destroying many × vehicles and × ammunition depots, and killing many × soldiers. The × army in Yangzhou was extremely frightened.

### Chongqing Air Raid Shelters to be Completed This Summer, Able to Accommodate 100,000 People

[Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing, 22nd] The new, most modern air-raid shelter being built here, which goes deep into the rock strata for 4,100 meters, will be completed this summer. At that time, in the event of an air-raid warning, 100,000 of Chongqing's 700,000 residents will be able to quickly take shelter in the tunnel. Once the war ends, the tunnel can also be used for peacetime purposes. According to records, Japanese planes have crossed over Chongqing five times, but there has only been one mass bombing, so Chongqing is considered relatively safe. Chongqing's climate is unfavorable, with clouds and fog almost every day, so Japanese planes cannot easily carry out air raids unless the sun is bright. The Chinese anti-aircraft artillery units outside the city often fire when Japanese planes come to attack, but the most recent time was an exception. Furthermore, Chinese fighter planes often stay on the ground without taking off, so that the × planes cannot know their exact location. In addition, the × planes must fly particularly high when attacking to avoid the Chinese planes' counterattack, so their bombing cannot be very accurate. Furthermore, the high-speed × planes, even if they take off from Hankou, cannot have a very long range. Once they reach Chongqing, they must rely on the weapons they carry to defend themselves. The tunnel was started on "August 13th" of last year. Unfortunately, due to a lack of excavators, the completion date has to be postponed to this summer. Otherwise, it could have been completed by February of this year. The tunnel has twenty entrances, the main entrance being called "Guanyin Cave." The tunnel is one and a half meters wide, and the domed ceiling is from ten to thirty meters above the ground. The tunnel is equipped with ten ventilators, each with five to ten horsepower, as well as generators and loudspeakers to spread news. After the war ends, the tunnel can be used as a pedestrian tunnel, which will be much more convenient as there will be no need to go through Chongqing's uneven streets. The tunnel will cost a total of 700,000 yuan in national currency, of which the Ministry of Finance has allocated 200,000 yuan.

[Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, 22nd] Approximately 30,000 Chongqing residents leave the city every day to cross the Jialing River to the north in order to avoid air raids.

### International Situation Continues to Improve; Chongqing is Filled with Optimism; Sino-Philippine Relations Become Increasingly Harmonious

[Special dispatch from our Chongqing office, 20th] Because the international situation is increasingly favorable to us, we have decided to work hard on the major plan of resistance. (The following telegram code is unclear).

[Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing, 22nd] Senior officials of the Chinese government are very optimistic when discussing the daily news of the war, especially regarding British loans. However, senior officials close to President Kong, when asked about this, replied that they did not have the freedom to tell the reporters about this matter. Political and financial circles seem very confident of obtaining British loans, but the exact amount is still unknown. Observers say that British and American loans to China are a sign of opposition to Japanese military aggression.

[Associated Press dispatch from Manila, 23rd] The Chinese Consul General in the Philippines and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce here jointly hosted a banquet for the governors and mayors of the provinces of the Philippines who came to Manila for a meeting. During the banquet, the Chinese Consul General, Ou Guangsheng, delivered a speech, saying that China and the Philippines should maintain close relations. China and the Philippines are neighbors in East Asia, and we dare say that these two great nations will cooperate for the prosperity and mutual benefit of both nations.

### Puppet Mayor of Hangzhou, He Ni, Assassinated; He's Wife and Four Others Injured; Assailants Escape Unscathed

[Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing, 23rd] According to Shanghai news, He Zuan, the puppet mayor of Hangzhou, was seriously injured by two armed Chinese last night. The two men broke into He's residence at 9:00 PM and opened fire indiscriminately at the people in the room. He was shot in the thigh, and He's wife and four others in the room were also injured. Before leaving, the shooters threw two hand grenades and left. He and the other injured have all been sent to the hospital for treatment. The shooters have not been captured yet.

Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Detective Huang Fusen Shot

[Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing, 22nd] According to Shanghai news, Huang Fusen, the Chinese Deputy Detective of the Shanghai Public Concession Police Department, was suddenly ambushed at noon on the 23rd at the corner of Yuzhiqing Road and Kuling Road by three burly men armed with Mauser pistols. Huang was shot twice, one bullet hitting his shoulder and exiting through his chest, and the other hitting his waist and entering his abdomen. He was immediately sent to the Baodui Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, his life is feared to be in danger.

### × Is in a Difficult Situation Diplomatically and Militarily; German Newspapers Warn ×

[Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 22nd] The position of Japan in diplomatic and military affairs has recently been commented on by various German newspapers. Among them, the Frankfurter Zeitung stated that in view of the various decisions taken by the US government, the position of Japan is particularly worrying. The US authorities have now decided to set up defensive fortifications on islands in the Pacific, so Japan is in danger of being militarily encircled. Moreover, US actions are not limited to this. For example, the three countries of the US, Britain and France sent notes with strong language to Japan. The two countries of Britain and America lent money to China. All of this is clearly very unfavorable to Japan. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung published a cartoon, marking the various naval bases that the US government plans to build, and stated that according to President Roosevelt's plan, it can be seen that the US has intentions to advance in the southeastern direction. This move is unfavorable to Japan, and even more obvious. The Tokyo side was greatly shocked by this. The will of the Washington government is to exert heavy pressure on Japan. This cannot be opposed by the American people. Since the internal turmoil in the Soviet Union has emerged one after another, resulting in weakened national strength, its offensive against various totalitarian countries, that is, the signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact, has been replaced by the United States.

### × Is About to Extend the Reserve Service of the Army and Navy; × Warlords Advocate a Fascist Military Alliance in Their Newspaper

[Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing, 23rd] According to foreign news from Tokyo, the Japanese Army Ministry announced that the bill to extend the term of reserve service for the Japanese Army and Navy will be submitted to the current session of the Diet for discussion. The Army reserve service will be extended by five years, the Navy's reserve service by one year, and the auxiliary reserve service by two years.

[Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo, 23rd] In an editorial today, the Kokumin Shimbun, the newspaper of the Japanese warlords, stated that for the sake of world peace, the Japanese government should change the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan. This agreement would enable Japan to eliminate aid to China from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and end the war against China as soon as possible.

[Special dispatch from our Chongqing office, 23rd] According to diplomatic circles, if the Japanese Hiranuma Cabinet really concludes a military alliance with Germany and Italy and becomes estranged from Britain and the United States, then all democratic countries will inevitably cooperate with the Soviet Union to prevent the growth of Japanese power.

### Mr. Li Genyuan, the Cultivator of Our Country's Military Leaders – A Visit Record

— By Li Baoquan, our special correspondent in Kunming

There is a notable elder in Yunnan now, and that is Mr. Li Yinquan (Genyuan).

Mr. Li founded the "Military Academy" in Kunming in the first year of the Xuantong reign of the deposed Qing Dynasty. At that time, Mr. Li held the position of Director of the Military Academy. Many of the political talents who came out of it are now extremely well-known throughout the country, such as the late Mr. Zhu Peide, and Mr. Zhu De, the leader of the Eighth Route Army. These were all students of the first class. Later, Mr. Li continued to run the Military Academy in Shaozhou, Guangdong. Students there included the late Mr. Guo Songling and Mr. Sheng Shicai, the current governor of Xinjiang. All of them also came from Mr. Li's tutelage. There are many other generals and officers currently serving as army commanders and division commanders in the country. It can truly be said that "students are all over the world." When the August 13th Anti-Japanese War broke out, Mr. Li was living in seclusion in Suzhou. When our army withdrew from Suzhou, Mr. Li had no choice but to withdraw with the army. After arriving in Hankou, his student Sheng Shicai, the governor of Xinjiang, specially sent a plane from Xinjiang to pick him up. However, because the terrain in Xinjiang was too high and the air was extremely thin, it was not suitable for Mr. Li's health. As a result, he suffered from heart failure and his condition was extremely dangerous. He had no choice but to leave Xinjiang. At that time, Long Yun, the chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government, learned that Mr. Li had left Xinjiang due to illness, so he sent a welcoming telegram inviting Mr. Li to return to his hometown. Mr. Li also believed that during this period of resistance against Japan, Yunnan's relationship with the country in terms of military and political aspects was very important. This was not just a simple matter of "benefiting his hometown." Therefore, at the invitation of Chairman Long, he boarded a plane again and flew back to Yunnan despite his serious illness. Chairman Long arranged for Mr. Li to stay at the Yuyuan Guesthouse in Kunming. Mr. Li, on the advice of his doctor, besides settling his family in Kunming, went to the hot springs in Ningzhou to recuperate. When there were important events that needed to be discussed with the authorities, he would drive back to Kunming for a few days.

Because I, the reporter, had met Mr. Li several times before, I heard two days ago that Mr. Li had returned from the hot springs to Kunming to spend the New Year, so I sent a card to visit him. Although Mr. Li was extremely busy, he still received me immediately. Although his physique was still holding a cane due to his illness, the color on his face was a bright red, and especially when I saw his two sparkling eyes, I could imagine that he had superior energy when he was young.

After Mr. Li and the reporter exchanged greetings, I explained my intention to visit him for the Shen Bao and expressed that if the life and thoughts of a respected elder like Mr. Li were recorded, it would surely be welcomed by Shen Bao readers at home and abroad. However, Mr. Li's attitude was very humble, and he repeatedly said, "I dare not, I dare not," and bowed repeatedly with both hands.

After several requests from the reporter, he made some remarks in a very solemn and sincere manner: "I have been away from Yunnan for fourteen or fifteen years. It was in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China that I went to Suzhou and never came to Yunnan again. This year, I only returned to my province to reside because of my illness. My hometown is Qushi in Tengchong, Yunnan. My family moved there from Jiangsu at the end of the Ming Dynasty. I grew up there, so I have a deep impression of that place. I lived in Suzhou for a long time, but I can never forget my nostalgia for my hometown. In my writings, I often like to use the words Qushi as a title, such as 'Qushi Series,' 'Qushi Prose,' 'Qushi Poetry,' etc. This is just to commemorate and miss my ancestors and my hometown, but in fact it is all unnecessary, and I will have to ask for your correction in the future..."

Mr. Li was always so polite. His poems are extremely good. I especially love the first two lines of his seven-character quatrain "Mourning My Elder Brother, Mr. Taiyan" in the "Qushi Poetry": "In life, we were both friends and teachers, For ten thousand ages, a feather in the clouds." There is also a line in his poem "Writing Love" written when he was about to leave Suzhou: "... The declining trend on the battlefield is difficult to reverse, and the dangerous situation is worrying. Unfortunately, it falls into the hands of the Japanese invaders, and the scriptures and property are at their disposal. Go to the three islands of ×××, strong men and scholars are killed together. How can this scene be described? The descendants of Yan and Huang are all like cattle and horses. Imperialism is originally like this, and if you cannot be self-reliant, what is the excuse,..."

In this poem, not only can it be seen that Mr. Li's use of words such as "imperialism" is extremely free and bold, but also in the style of the poem, he breaks away from the old customs and gallops in the realm of realism. At that time, because I talked with Mr. Li about his poetry, it aroused his interest, and he smiled and told me that he had a poem when he returned to Yunnan, so he chanted aloud: "The divine eagle flaps its wings out of Chang'an, Ten thousand miles of light clouds return in a day; May I ask what the guest brings back? A body of sickness and gray hair." I immediately copied it down with a pen and added it to the text of this interview record. Mr. Li's other works, such as "Jingyitang Poetry Collection" and "Preliminary Draft of Yunnan Inscriptions," are extremely valuable. Due to space limitations, I cannot introduce them in detail here. We will discuss them in detail when we have the opportunity in the future.

### Wartime Book and Magazine Manuscript Review Measures Amended and Approved by the Central Standing Committee and Promulgated

[Chongqing Air Dispatch] To meet wartime needs, the Central Government, in its 86th meeting of the Central Standing Committee in July of last year, passed the "Wartime Book and Magazine Manuscript Review Measures." In October of the same year, it established the Central and local Book and Magazine Review Committees to begin work. Since the commencement of manuscript review work, based on several months of practical experience, it was deeply felt that the previously promulgated "Wartime Book and Magazine Manuscript Review Measures" needed to be amended as appropriate. Regarding the measures, purely academic works, the content of which does not involve current affairs issues, politics, society, or ideology, may not require submission for review. The manuscript need not be typeset in advance, but must be submitted to the reviewing authority for review before publication and distribution. Regarding the scope, previously, publications of party, government, and military organs were exempt from manuscript review. However, many publications of these organs are theoretical in nature, and the authors are not all responsible personnel of the organs, making them not much different from general publications. Therefore, regarding such books and periodicals, with the exception of "official gazettes," manuscripts must also be submitted for review to ensure universality. Regarding procedures, previously, it was stipulated that those submitting manuscripts for review must submit three copies of the final proof. At a time when printing in the interior is extremely difficult, this was felt to be inconvenient. It would be better to submit handwritten manuscripts or proofs, and after review, the original manuscript or proof would be stamped with an "Reviewed" seal and returned to the submitter, for the sake of convenience. Based on the above requirements, the Central Government, at its 106th meeting of the Central Standing Committee on December 22nd of last year, proposed amendments to Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the measures. The full text of the amended version is recorded below.

### The Western Republican Government Relocates from Barcelona, Defending and Holding Firm in the Outskirts of the City, Britain and France Confer Repeatedly on the Spanish Situation

[Central News Agency, Perpignan, Southern France, 22nd] People in the Spanish Republican government have stated that the President of the country, Azaña, has left the city of Barcelona and will relocate with all government personnel to Valencia or Madrid, but the exact location is not yet known. The government military headquarters has, following the precedent set in Madrid during times of crisis, built defensive fortifications on the high ground near Barcelona and is hastily constructing defense lines in the suburbs. Furthermore, French expatriates arriving here from Barcelona say that refugees from the Nationalist-occupied area are flocking to the city, exacerbating the food shortage.

[Central News Agency, Juan-les-Pins, 22nd] According to news from here tonight, the diplomatic corps are all withdrawing from Barcelona, and the French embassy is also evacuating.

[Central News Agency, Perpignan, 22nd] Spanish government sources stated today that Barcelona will not surrender even if it has to fight to the last man. The area around the city is already equipped with 250 to 300 cannons of various calibers for defense. Other reports indicate that the Spanish government is preparing to move to Girona. The fortress of Peralada near Girona and 20 kilometers from the French border is strongly built and can be used for defense. It contains valuable artworks, jewelry, and a large amount of remaining cash reserves from the Bank of Spain.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 22nd] Prime Minister Daladier met with Foreign Minister Bonnet this afternoon and discussed the international situation, especially the situation caused by the Nationalist advance towards the city of Barcelona. The meeting lasted thirty minutes.

[Associated Press, London, 23rd] According to unconfirmed reports received here from Gibraltar, five Italian ships, fully loaded with tanks, artillery, and ammunition, escorted by eleven Italian destroyers, arrived at Cadiz and immediately unloaded their cargo, which was transported away by train heading north.

[Reuters, Burgos, 22nd] The rebel authorities claim that a large shipment of arms and ammunition has arrived for the government forces, including 22 tanks that arrived via the Ventolra, Cerbère, and Le Perthus borders on Friday night, and that local customs officers have been ordered to allow them passage.

[Haitong News Agency, London, 23rd] In the past few days, Britain and France have exchanged views on the Spanish war several times. It is understood that France feels extremely tense because the final victory of the rebels would disrupt the plan for military equilibrium. France would not only have to defend the eastern and Alpine borders, but would also have to station troops on the Spanish border. The issue of German and Italian influence in Spain was also discussed, but Britain believes that Germany and Italy will not cause Franco to join the European arms race. France also fears that after the rebels win, Italy will demand that France withdraw its volunteers from Spain, make concessions on Gibraltar, Tunisia, and the Suez Canal, and announce its future policy towards Spain.

The Rebels Besiege Barcelona

[Central News Agency, London, 22nd] According to a radio report from the Nationalist headquarters in Burgos, the Nationalist forces are continuing to advance towards Barcelona, the Republican government's location. The villages of Subirats and Geltrú, 22 miles southwest of Barcelona, have been captured by the Nationalist forces. The French village, 20 miles west of Barcelona, is an important agricultural area in Catalonia, and it has also fallen. As a result, the Penedès area is now under Nationalist control. The vanguard is concentrating on Barcelona from all directions. One Nationalist unit, after capturing Igualada, advanced to the village of Cabrera de Anoia and attacked southeast along the Noya River, capturing an important iron bridge. The government forces, caught by surprise and failing to destroy the iron bridge, retreated. According to reports from Barcelona, citizens in the city and nearby villages in the war zone have been ordered to hastily build fortifications. Barcelona was bombed eight times yesterday. Nationalist aircraft are paying particular attention to the highway connecting Spain to France.

[Reuters, Lleida, 22nd] The Spanish rebels continued to advance today. It is said that their vanguard is only 15 miles from Barcelona in some places. A large rebel force of 150,000 men is approaching the Llobregat River, advancing from the coast to the northwest, with the entire line from Igualada to Noya reaching 25 miles. The rebels are also advancing along the highway to Ucraina and the Ponts-Solsona highway. Their objective is clearly to cut off Barcelona's traffic with France. It is said that the line is advancing an average of five miles per day. In the past 24 hours, rebel aircraft have again bombed Barcelona. However, the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are unknown. It is reported that the British ship "African Mariner" was sunk by rebel aircraft today. There was an aerial battle when the rebel aircraft attacked. There were 40 rebel aircraft and 20 government aircraft. The rebels apparently want to carry out an aerial blockade to stop supplies to the government, especially along the coastal highway to France. The British ship "Stanholm" of Valencia was also damaged in a rebel air raid this morning. It is reported that the rebel aircraft bombed Valencia this morning, dropping no fewer than 40 bombs.

[Central News Agency, Barcelona, 23rd] From last Monday to last night, Nationalist aircraft bombed Barcelona a total of 19 times, killing 30 civilians and injuring 66. The bombers were all German and Italian-made aircraft. The government forces are now using fighter planes in combat due to the proximity of the front line to Barcelona. Each bombing raid involves as many as 50 aircraft from both sides in aerial combat. The British ship "African Mariner" was previously bombed, but it did not sink. Six sailors on board were killed. In addition, four British ships were damaged by bombing at the end of last week, namely the "York Moor" with a hole in its side, the "Female Hunter" with damage to its deck, the "Dovreby" with damaged hull, and the "Spaniel Bark Lyle" with damage to its deck.

[Central News Agency, Valencia, 23rd] Yesterday morning, Spanish Nationalist aircraft bombed Valencia, and the British merchant ship "Stanholm" was also damaged.

### Tragedy Occurs at Fukuoka Coal Mine in Japan, 65 Dead

[Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] It is reported that a tragedy occurred at a coal mine in Fukuoka Prefecture, killing 65 people. Many were injured and rescue work is extremely difficult. The fate of 70 miners is still unknown.

### Wolves Discovered in Jämtland Province of Sweden, Authorities Decide to Deal with it Sternly

[Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd] Large numbers of wolves have recently been discovered in Jämtland Province, Sweden, posing a great danger to deer herds and travelers. Therefore, the authorities have decided to take extremely severe measures to deal with them, and plan to use airplanes equipped with machine guns to hunt the wolves.

### Mussolini Addresses Farmers, Ridicules Democratic Countries

[Reuters, Rome, 22nd] Today, Italian Premier Mussolini (see right picture) addressed farmers, his main purpose being to ridicule Western democratic countries and the enemies of Fascism. It is said that the enemies of Fascism are extremely ignorant and not worth worrying about. Their remarks are all intended to slander and fabricate out of thin air. He also said, "The French rumor that the Pope advised France to take a firm stance is the result of pure fabrication. I deeply believe that this kind of rumor is extremely foolish. It is easy to talk about taking a firm stance. What would happen if an Italian came out tomorrow and told his countrymen that they must take an even firmer stance?" Mussolini said that the price of wheat this year will not be changed and hoped that the country will have a good harvest.

### Fuselage of "Clipper" Being Searched, Ten Passengers Rescued

[Haitong News Agency, New York, 23rd] Ten of the thirteen passengers and crew of the Imperial Airways "Clipper" have been rescued. The other two passengers (American) and one flight attendant (British) are missing. All those rescued are exhausted and weak, and some may not recover. The American destroyer Erie arrived at the scene of the incident yesterday with a doctor on board. The plane appears to have sunk shortly after landing, as those rescued were wearing life jackets.

[Haitong News Agency, New York, 22nd] The Imperial Airways "Clipper" has sunk in the Atlantic Ocean. Efforts to search for it began this morning. The US Navy blimp K21, nine Army giant airplanes, and one Navy giant airplane are preparing to fly to the scene. In addition, nine coastal patrol ships and one gunboat are also participating. It is reported that the yachts "Boomerda Commodore," "Boomerda Queen," and the ship "Port Walderton" are all searching near the scene. The search area is 500 miles long. According to a report from a coastal patrol plane, there is no trace of the plane in the area around the scene. It is also reported from Miami that Imperial Airways had communicated with the "Clipper" by radiotelephone at 2:10 AM, but this has been denied by the company.

### American Newspaper Urges Ban on Scrap Iron Exports, Otherwise it Will be Made into Weapons to Attack the American Coast

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] The Sunday Star published an article calling for the United States to ban the export of scrap iron as a way to economically sanction world aggressors. According to the article, "Supplying America's hypothetical enemies with basic raw materials is an extremely inconsistent fact. Who knows if one day the weapons made from these materials will attack our coast and kill our people? We are calling for peace on the one hand, and openly selling scrap iron to countries eager for war on the other hand, which is morally questionable." According to statistics, the amount of scrap iron purchased by Japan and Germany has greatly increased.

### American Special Aircraft Climbs Six Thousand Meters in a Short Time of Six Minutes

[Havas Agency, New York] A newly built special aircraft here can climb six thousand meters in a short time of six minutes. The aircraft has only one seat and is equipped with two machine guns that can fire bullets from the wings. The flight speed is 485 kilometers per hour. The maximum altitude is 19,700 feet. The engine has 600 horsepower.

### Gibraltar Port Holds Defense Exercises, Everything Imitates Wartime Conditions

[Central News Agency, Gibraltar Port, 23rd] Gibraltar held defense exercises last night. All the lights in the port were turned off.

### Restrictions on Silver Prices, US President Roosevelt Does Not Intend to Request Further Authorization

[Associated Press, Washington, 22nd] According to semi-official reports, the period for which Congress authorized President Roosevelt to restrict domestic silver prices will expire on June 30 this year. Roosevelt does not intend to ask Congress to reauthorize this power. He said that he felt that the restriction plan, although assisted by Treasury Department personnel, had failed to achieve its purpose. Currently, the domestic silver price is 64 cents per ounce, while the world silver price is 43 cents. Treasury Department personnel recently stated that although silver supporters are demanding higher silver prices, they do not expect silver prices to rise sharply. The Republican Party in the House of Representatives, led by Martin, is conducting a campaign against the silver price restriction plan. At the same time, Senator Townsend has also suggested amending the Silver Purchase Act in the Senate.

### Leader of Arab Defense Party Advocates Participation in London Conference

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 22nd] The leader of the Palestinian Arab Defense Party, Nassashibi, broke his long silence yesterday and telegraphed his nephew, agreeing with the results of the conference with the British authorities and advocating sending representatives to the London Conference. Nassashibi's sudden statement is of great significance, as the party had previously advocated taking terrorist actions.

### Rumor that Hitler Telegraphed Mussolini Urging Him to Maintain Peace for One Year Regarding Unified Management of Political and Economic Power, Soviet Union Believes Germany is Unable to Attack Ukraine

[This Newspaper, Shanghai, 24th Special Dispatch] According to United Press International, Rome, Hitler recently instructed his ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, to strongly urge Mussolini to maintain peace for one year. Mackensen was ordered to visit Ciano to listen to the details of Chamberlain and Mussolini's negotiations. Afterwards, he immediately telegraphed Hitler, and shortly thereafter, sent Hitler's personal letter to Mussolini. Rome believes that Mussolini provided Germany with assistance at the Munich Conference, and Hitler now feels that it is time to repay the favor.

[This Newspaper, Shanghai, 23rd Special Dispatch] According to a telegram from Vladivostok relayed from Moscow, although the European situation has become tense again after the resignation of Schacht, the head of the German National Bank, Moscow still does not believe that there will be a war in Ukraine this spring, as Hitler's strength is still insufficient. Seeing that the Sino-Japanese War is prolonged indefinitely, Hitler feels that Japan is difficult to help, so he plans to choose the easier path and attack Southeastern Europe, mainly targeting Romania.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] According to German newspapers, after Schacht's departure, Germany has now decided to adopt an economic policy based on centralism. According to the finances and economy of a centralist political country, its management power cannot be separated. The "People's Observer" stated that the fact that Economic Minister Funk also serves as the president of the Deutsche Bank can allow Germany to achieve its economic goals more easily. Germany is currently lacking in labor force, so it must increase the effectiveness of various industries, and the merger of the financial and economic departments is necessary. The "Berlin Daily" denied that there were any changes in Germany's economic policy and said that the government would maintain the Deutsche Bank's domestic and foreign credit.

### Senator Pittman Broadcasts Speech, Supports Military Expansion Plan to Prevent German and Japanese Aggression, Republican Party Organizes Committee to Review

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] US Senator Pittman, in a broadcast speech, supported the US government's military expansion plan. He said that the United States is in danger of being invaded by foreign countries. "Hitler's ambitions are never satisfied, and Japan's fixed policy is to dominate East Asia and the islands of the West Pacific." The Republican Party has organized an "Eleven-Member Committee" to review the military expansion plan. Senator Taft of the party told people that President Roosevelt's military expansion requests are not excessive. President Roosevelt's foreign policy, which he supports, is not only to defend the country, so the military strength he needs should be far more powerful than it is now.

### Qi Yano Returns to Rome, Establishing Close Economic Relations Between the Two Countries, Huge Loan for Southern Countries to Purchase Italian Military Equipment

[Central News Agency, Yugoslavia Capital, 22nd] After a day of banquets and social events, Foreign Minister Qi Yano took a special train back to his country in the evening. Earlier today, Qi Yano and Prince Regent Paul went hunting, then returned here to meet with Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović. He then presided over the opening ceremony of the Italian Book Exhibition, visited the central headquarters of the Yugoslav government party in the Yugoslav capital branch of the Italian Fascist Party, delivered a speech to Italian expatriates, and finally attended a banquet hosted by Prince Regent Paul.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 22nd] According to news from here tonight, Italian officials are extremely satisfied with the results of the meeting between Qi Yano and Stojadinović. In summary, they can be divided into three items: (1) Establishing a closer economic relationship between Italy and Yugoslavia; (2) Establishing an Italian Chamber of Commerce in the Yugoslav capital and a Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce in Rome; (3) Establishing an Italian motorcycle military factory in the Yugoslav capital, with the participation of the Yugoslav industrial and capital sectors. In addition, it seems that there was a discussion about Italy lending 500 million Italian lira to Yugoslavia to purchase military equipment in Italy. According to reliable sources, in addition to military equipment, there may be other loan possibilities.

### Philippine Independence Act, Roosevelt Advocates Amendment

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] It is widely believed here that when President Roosevelt submits a new plan to Congress to amend the Philippine Independence Act in the future, Congress will have to re-examine its policy toward the Philippines. According to President Roosevelt, he does not intend to submit a plan to Congress to amend the Philippine Independence Act in the form of a special message, so that Congress can freely decide its attitude. The issue of fortification of Guam will also be determined based on Congress's attitude toward the Philippine issue.

Brief Commentary

### Traitors Run Around for ×, Promoting "Peace"

After the incident of Wang Zhao-ming ×××× was regarded as "past," the ××××'s "peace" conspiracy to divide unity and undermine the War of Resistance was ignored, which is a very significant crisis at present.

Wang Zhao-ming's communication with ××× to seek peace and surrender did not originate from a sudden event. The crushing and eradication of this communication with ××× to seek peace and surrender conspiracy cannot be achieved overnight with a single document or telegram. If this kind of conspiracy to seek peace and surrender is not thoroughly swept away one day, not only will the War of Resistance and nation-building not be completed one day, but even the national unity in the War of Resistance will not be able to continue.

The newspapers these days reported that the traitors in South China are being used by × to run around for "peace," advocating the construction of a "Southwest Anti-Communist Peace Government," sending claws and fangs to those who are estranged from the government and who are highly regarded, and ××××, tempting them with sweet words and generous rewards. This is one of the new ways of activity of the elements who collude with × to betray the country and seek peace and surrender. These elements are not only acting so stupidly overseas, but are still secretly plotting in the country. Although their insane activities are of no success, their influence on confusing people's minds and undermining unity on the future of the War of Resistance and nation-building cannot be tolerated for a moment!

On the one hand, we must awaken the general people of high prestige, improve self-confidence and self-esteem, improve the heart-wrenching alert of × people and traitors, not only passively not being tempted and utilized by × well, but also actively exposing the truth of × traitor conspiracy, ×× the group of righteous patriots in the society, ×××. On the other hand, we also hope that this Fifth Plenary Session will make a serious and more realistic decision on a way to thoroughly eradicate pro-Japanese traitors and activities that are not conducive to united resistance. Special attention should be paid to the fact that these elements will be deeply hidden under the guise of "anti-communism." We should use the national alliance force to consolidate unity across the country to give them a fatal counterattack.

### Serious Situation in Spain

The Spanish War is a war in which the two fascist aggressive countries of Italy and Germany are endangering the democratic republic of Spain. At the same time, it is also a war in which these two aggressive countries are endangering the democratic powers of Europe, especially Britain and France. Unfortunately, the main countries were confused by the "anti-communist" smoke screen of the aggressors and restricted by the short-sighted psychology of selfishness and self-interest. They did not recognize this point. They dreamed that after the aggressors obtained certain satisfaction in Spain, they would no longer harass them. Therefore, as early as two and a half years ago, they adopted a so-called "non-intervention" policy for this war that actually infringed upon themselves, allowing Italian and German iron hooves and bombs to run rampant in Spain. Even this time, the League of Nations Administrative Council had to discuss the issue of withdrawing foreign volunteers who were helping the Spanish Republican Army! No wonder Italy is even more frantically planning an offensive, and now the fascist army is approaching Barcelona and the French border; no wonder it has aroused the indignant opposition of the Communist Party, the Labour Party, the Socialist Party and other progressive and righteous people in Britain and France, advocating for immediate and large-scale aid to the Spanish government, and former US Secretary of State Stimson also demanded yesterday morning that the ban on the shipment of munitions to Spain be lifted!

Now the situation in Spain has become very serious due to the more frantic offensives of Italy and Germany. We admire the spirit of the Spanish government and people who have bravely resisted for two and a half years to safeguard peace and democracy. We admire the determination of Spain and its international allied forces to vow to shed the last drop of blood to fight for freedom and peace, but we should not sit idly by and watch Spain's bitter struggle without lending a helping hand. Because the day when Italy and Germany ×× succeed in Spain will also be the time when Japan ×× is more rampant in the Far East—even if we cannot provide the Spanish government with any material assistance, we must mobilize public opinion, mobilize all spiritual forces, and mobilize the power of the united front of people from all countries in the world to urge Britain, France and the United States to resolutely abandon the "non-intervention" or "neutral" policy that only benefits the enemy, quickly impose effective sanctions on the aggressors, and provide the Spanish government with the convenience of obtaining greater external assistance! Because helping Spain is helping Britain, America, Russia themselves, and it is also helping world peace!

### Romania Under the Gaze of the National Socialist Party

— Beard

Since Bismarck's eastward policy was incorporated into Hitler's "Mein Kampf" and revived, Romania has also become one of the targets of the National Socialist Party's aggression. Carol is a descendant of the German Hohenzollern family. His mistress, Mrs. Lupescu, is the richest woman in the country. Although she is of Jewish blood, she is the most outspoken advocate of anti-Semitism. Her political power is at least comparable to that of Mrs. Astor of England. Carol is surrounded by a group of corrupt soldiers, corrupt officials and idle politicians. In particular, the so-called officer corps is composed of the sons of feudal landlords, and the Fascist atmosphere is very strong. Therefore, Hitler's spies can infiltrate the central important agencies of Romania. Many political parties are under his command. More than 80 Romanian newspapers accept Goebbels' command. In 1936, the German Propaganda Ministry spent 60 million Romanian lei on propaganda in Romania. Newspapers with the 卍 symbol are openly published in almost every city. Like the German Emperor, Hitler first wanted (1) British neutrality (2) Italian sympathy (3) to make France incapable. He actually armed the Rhineland smoothly, built fortifications on the Siegfried Line, cut off France's route to aid its Eastern European allies, signed a so-called ten-year non-aggression treaty with Poland, cut off the channel for the Soviet Union to aid France, and used Italy's isolation during the Italo-Ethiopian War to form the German-Italian axis, using aid to Franco as an exchange condition for Italy's tacit consent to annex Austria. After the establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact, he then used Czechoslovakia as a surgical target. Chamberlain's guarantee that Britain and Germany would not fight in the future seemed to mean that Hitler could walk alone in Southeastern Europe without having to worry about British intervention. However, Hitler's progress is not necessarily so optimistic. The result of Halifax's negotiations with him in Berlin last September was that Britain tacitly agreed to his annexation of Austria and the partition of Czechoslovakia as an exchange condition for Germany's temporary suspension of colonial demands. These have now been gradually realized, but if he wants to attack again, Britain can no longer remain neutral. ×××××××× can no longer be moved to the Balkan Peninsula to let him break into the gateway to the Near East.

After the Munich Conference, France has been relegated to a secondary position in Europe. Although it does not dare to abandon the Franco-Soviet Pact and still wants to continue to struggle, the general trend has been lost after the partition of Czechoslovakia, and it has to follow Britain. As far as Central Europe, the Balkans and the Near East are concerned, Britain and France have the same interests. At least they are completely consistent in preventing Nazi forces from invading their sphere of influence, so even though Hitler has made France powerless, he cannot make Britain remain neutral forever. Moreover, he is not sure about winning Italian sympathy. Italy is willing for Germany to take back its overseas colonies, because Mussolini knows that the German navy is not enough to confront Britain. Once they get it, they will have to rely on the Italian navy for help. In this way, they can call Hitler to listen to him. Therefore, he tried his best to instigate the Germans to intensify their overseas development and did not want Germany to sit up in Europe and block his way to the Balkans and the Near East. Italy's markets in the Balkan Peninsula and Turkey and other countries have been almost completely encroached upon by Germany after the League of Nations passed economic sanctions against Italy. This year, without firing a shot, it annexed Austria and the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia. Mussolini saw that his apprentice was so powerful that he was actually better than him, and his power was surprisingly above him, so he was restless and wanted to find a way to stop him. Recently, Hungary requested the recovery of Ruthenia in southern Czechoslovakia and to connect with Poland, which Italy strongly approved of. The purpose was to form a barrier to prevent German eastward invasion by the joint line of Poland and Hungary. Hitler also understood very well, and he had already planned in his mind that Ruthenia is a Ukrainian national area, and there are many Ukrainians in Poland and the Soviet Union. He wanted to use it as a base to prepare for aggression against the Soviet Union and Poland. Mussolini was afraid that Hitler would dismantle the stage in Spain, so he did not dare to insist. However, we should be aware that the British-Italian agreement was motivated by Germany's annexation of Austria, and it was completed at the time of the partition of Czechoslovakia. Mussolini will never be a wedding dress for Hitler forever.

Secondly, we talk about Hungary. Hungary lost a lot of land after the war and has always been opposed to the Little Entente. It has no good feelings for Romania in particular because of the loss of land. It originally wanted to rely on Germany's strength to confront each other, but since Austria's death, it has been directly adjacent to Germany and feels threatened. Hitler had long wanted to make Hungary available to him, so he promised to help him recover the lost land in Czechoslovakia. However, Hitler temporarily changed his mind, and the request to recover Ruthenia and connect with Poland was rejected by Hitler. Moreover, Ruthenia has become Germany's base for the Greater Ukrainian Independence Movement. Hungary is certainly disappointed. When Germany invades Romania in the future, will Hitler reissue blank checks and allow it to pass through? It depends on whether the relationship between the Balkan countries and Hungary can be improved and how vigilant the Magyar nation is.

Poland is Romania's northern neighbor. It was originally very close to Germany. Recently, seeing Czechoslovakia's fate, it feels that it is already surrounded on three sides by German forces, and the so-called Greater Ukrainian National Independence Movement is fundamentally aimed at it. Especially the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor are in imminent danger. So it hurriedly signed a new Polish-Soviet treaty and made peace with Lithuania. Foreign Minister Beck's masterpiece was warmly praised by the people. In the recent parliamentary election, Professor Macosky, the leader of the National Unity Front, was elected Speaker of the House, and Colonel Miedziński was elected Speaker of the Senate. Poland is already turning to an anti-German path. The Soviet Union is Romania's western neighbor. In the anti-fascist struggle, it is the main force in the world. If Romania has the determination to defend itself, it must first eradicate the Nazi running dogs in the country. Of course, the Soviet Union is happy to help. (To be continued)

### Hong Kong Government Determined to Eradicate Red Pill Poison, Chinese Affairs Secretary and Health Secretary Summoned the President of the Anti-Drug Association Yesterday

The harm of red pill poison far exceeds that of opium. In the past four or five years, it has become increasingly severe, and the poison has spread throughout various districts of Hong Kong. Even after the authorities severely investigated and cracked down on it, the flames of poison have not only failed to extinguish, but have intensified. The current Acting Chinese Affairs Secretary has always hated this poison. Recently, as there is an Anti-Drug Promotion Association in Hong Kong, and it is the only anti-drug group, he specially summoned the President of the Association, Liu Jingqing, yesterday morning to consult on the association's recent progress and plans to promote anti-drug efforts. President Liu and Secretary-General Pan Youcheng went to present the details of their observations. Their opinions can be summarized into two points: (1) Winning hearts is the best strategy, using various propaganda to make everyone understand the harm of red pill poison. (2) Practical treatment, establishing a red pill treatment center to enable patients to stay in the center for treatment. Secretary Ka listened and was very satisfied, and immediately introduced Mr. Liu to Health Secretary Situ Yongjue. Secretary Situ also expressed great sympathy and requested to study treatment methods with Professor Shu Lu, the honorary president of the association. If the research results still conclude that a treatment center is indispensable, then I will do my best to support it, and so on.

Special Report by This Newspaper

### In the Refugee Camp

— Luo Xia

More than 900 isolated soldiers who retreated from Shatoujiao into British territory and were guarded are living a lonely life in the Ma Tau Chung refugee camp. For a month, there has been no unexpected change. However, since the incident of "shooting a deserter", unfortunate events have followed one after another. People from all walks of life have shown great sympathy for their misfortune; the authorities are also paying close attention to this matter and are making every effort to improve their lives and eliminate the occurrence of various misfortunes. Yesterday, the reporter got a good opportunity to run into the heavily guarded refugee camp to visit these refugee soldiers. Coincidentally, the refugee service team sent by the Youth Association also arrived at this time, adding a lot of excitement. Here, I roughly recorded the impressions I got in the past month.

It was noon, and the friendly sun was warmly caressing their bodies. After getting off the bus, I ran along the yellow mud road that passes through the refugee camp. I walked busily, and my forehead was slightly sweating, but when I arrived at the refugee camp and saw the heavily guarded scene, I seemed to have lost the sun's heat. What was beating in my heart was only "coldness"! The refugee soldiers were all wearing gray cotton-padded jackets, huddled under the sun. On their malnourished and dark faces, there was an even more desolate look of haggardness. In order to provide them with proper recreation, Room No. 2 was set up as a club. At this time, many people were surrounding the long table, looking at the books and magazines sent by others. Another group was surrounding the phonograph. The walls were covered with cautionary signs sent by the Youth Military Service Corps and other wall newspapers, and the surroundings were filled with a new atmosphere!

Not long after, several comrades from the Youth Association's Military Service Corps arrived. The refugee soldiers, who had gotten out of bed, were walking around, and reading books, gathered around as if they had heard the news. The windows on all sides were filled with heads, surrounding these dozens of members. "Newspapers! Newspapers!" a burst of clamorous voices, followed by everyone reaching out to grab them. "Don't move, the administrator will distribute them to you later," a young man in the service team shouted like this. Everyone listened and stood by with their hands down.

After distributing the letters from relatives and friends outside, they began to give current affairs reports: "The war in the Northwest... × people are trying to cut off our international route, but this is just a dream... Now the × people there have been heavily surrounded." The young man kept saying, "Now let's talk about the war on the Guangdong side!"——Guangdong! Guangdong! caused a small commotion. "On the northern front, on the night of the 15th, more than 1,000 × soldiers from near Zhongluotan and Hehe were thinking of invading north. Our ambushing artillery took advantage of their unpreparedness and launched artillery fire. Our heroic soldiers also rushed over, with cannons and grenades flying together, killing them without leaving a single piece of armor." At this time, they were listening with their ears and thinking with their hearts, thinking of their activity on the battlefield, thinking of the pleasure of killing ×, some were stunned, and some were slapping their thighs and shouting. The young man paused and continued: "Now our 100,000 troops have advanced in separate ways and are making a large-scale encirclement of Guangzhou. I believe that in the near future, we will be able to completely drive these remaining × out of Guangdong." A burst of warm applause sent the breathless young man off the stage!

Then they played the phonograph they brought. The first record was called Defend Greater Guangdong, which was sung in Cantonese, "Compatriots, 30 million people, must defend Greater Guangdong..." The magnificent singing voice penetrated their hearts, and they were very excited. Then they sang Defend China "You haven't recognized the lyrics yet! Let me tell you about it," the young man said as he stood up. "The first sentence is to defend China, defend China, swear to defend democratic China, which means that in this critical autumn of national survival, who doesn't want to defend our Republic of China except for the Han traitors, but are we defending it with our mouths? No! We must take out all our strength and put life and death aside to defend China," the last sentence is to look at the Northeast rivers and mountains, the blue sky and white sun all over the ground still flying, listen to 400 million people singing, freedom, equality, liberation, which means that when we win the final victory, the national flag with the blue sky and white sun all over the ground will still be flying in the Northeast, and at that time the children of the 400 million Chinese people will sing in unison, what will they sing? It's not singing "for a beautiful woman" but singing freedom! Equality! Liberation!" A burst of cheerful laughter ended the explanation of the lyrics.

As the magnificent singing voice was played, everyone's heart was already surging. After the record was finished, the young man jumped onto the stage and asked loudly: "Are you willing to defend China?" The crowd immediately followed and said: "We are willing!" "Then, you must strictly abide by discipline and not act rashly. Wait for another opportunity to show your skills!" The young man said loudly, raising his hands, and the crowd also shouted "Okay!" in unison.

Then the young man rubbed his hands and jumped onto the stage again to teach them to sing: "Mobilize..." They could sing it without being taught. The young man said: "You still have a lot of strength!" Everyone laughed. The second one was to fight ×××... They sang it fluently without much guidance. The young man lightly said: "You all sing very well, but you have to use force when you sing 'fight', '××××××××××××'." Everyone couldn't help but laugh when they heard it.

After the singing was over, they summoned the representatives from each room to talk about the matter of each person fleeing privately. Everyone had some opinions. After hearing this, everyone expressed their opinions in a very innocent way according to the number of the room. A representative leaned closer and said: "We are about to have dinner. You go and see the situation over there. We know very clearly from the doctor that the government provides us with a certain amount of food, which is 3 taels of green vegetables, 2 taels of salted fish, and 11 taels of white rice per person per meal. 1 tael of meat, but now it is difficult to find this amount when calculating two meals together! However, the amount of rice will exceed 11 taels, because the rice is mixed with a lot of chaff! We have negotiated with the cooks. Guess what they said? They said, "If you can't swallow it, it's best not to eat it!"

Also, now it's winter, and the rich people are wearing heavy fur coats and don't know what cold is like. We were lucky enough to get two sheets, and those who were unlucky only got one. Huddling in the cold wind, who knows the desolate taste...". The representative continued in one breath, his face flushed with exertion.

Everyone was deeply moved after hearing these words and remained silent. They only tried their best to comfort them to be patient and not to act rashly, and to wait for the final victory to come, at which time they could be reborn. Everyone cheered and dispersed after listening!

Finally, we hope that the person in charge can pay close attention to their treatment and try to improve it as much as possible so that unfortunate events can be eliminated!

The Fifth Travelogue Returning to Hui

1. On the way to departure

[Special Travel Correspondent of This Newspaper] After the "October 12th" Incident, the × people used all their strength to land from Daya Bay and attack Guangzhou, causing Nanhua to fall into the hands of demons. We observe the overall war situation. Huizhou is the starting point for the × army to use strategies, and it is certainly important in the war situation; while Boluo County is the hub of military transportation between Huizhou and Guangzhou. When the × army advanced towards Zengcheng, it used Boluo to encircle and raid in two routes. Even the military transportation in South China in the future completely used the Guanghui Highway that runs through Boluo as a transportation channel. In general military terms, it is a place with extremely high military value. Moreover, the × army's retreat is still occupying two strongholds, Zengcheng and Shilong, lingering in the Litchi Garden in the Boluo-Zengcheng border area and the Dongbo area in the Boluo-Dongguan border area. It is obvious that Boluo is now standing on the front line of the eastern front and is still in a state of war. In order to commemorate those ashes that were destroyed by the magic hands of the × people, and to admire our soldiers who are standing on the front line, it seems that we should go to Boluo for a broad visit on the eve of this major counter-offensive to fulfill the duties of our reporter.

Because of this motive, although it is clear that the city that has just been recovered. The order and war are not stable, and there are considerable dangers and difficulties, but we cannot take everything into account. Therefore, two departure routes were decided: first, go down the Dongjiang River, focusing on the middle and lower reaches of the Dongjiang River; then, go along the Huiguang Highway, focusing on the Boluo-Zengcheng border area, that is, the front line of our army. On the morning of December 30, the reporter hired a speedboat and went down the river, starting a brave journey. At the same time, in order to prevent rampant bandits along the way, I also invited several members of the self-defense group to act as temporary bodyguards for the reporter.

The weather that day was neither rainy nor windy, and it was very gloomy. However, thick gray clouds were pieced together in the sky, as if the earth was brewing rain. Because there was no wind, the boat was moving very slowly, and the reporter was able to fully mourn the remains on both sides of the river in this slow and rhythmic rowing sound. I remember that when the 151st Division retreated from Huizhou on October 14, although they were all designated to gather in Boluo, one part crossed the river from the North Gate and went along the highway through Shuibei Station. The other part went straight down the river to Jiantan and crossed the river. Therefore, scattered military uniforms and utensils can still be seen on the Jiang'an section from Huizhou City to Jiantan. This proves that the retreat at that time was scattered and unplanned. It also proves the incompetence of the division commander, which led to this painful failure. However, "failure is the mother of success", and we always hope to build new strength from painful lessons. According to the boatman, a few days ago, there were still several corpses eroded by wind and rain scattered on the river bank, which were being collected by the villagers in the nearby villages. I don't know if they were soldiers or civilians. Really, × people's cruel blood debt is left everywhere and all the time. When can we wash it away?

It is only more than ten miles of water from Huizhou City to Jiantan. It was noon when we arrived at Jiantan. Suddenly, three × planes flew overhead from south to north, flying very low in the dog sky. The rattling sound of the plane suddenly shattered the silence of our journey. Fearing that it was for clear reconnaissance, it suddenly lowered and circled over the boat before turning away. In the moment when our small boat was circling, although the situation was a bit like a chick under a hungry eagle, the self-defense group in the boat had raised their guns and hid in the shed, preparing to fight back when the × plane fell low and strafed. Regardless of the size of the force, fighting for a price is our due determination.

Jiantan is originally a dangerous point in the Huibo waterway. The two mountains stand opposite each other, the pool is very deep, and constantly floating and rolling whirlpools are churning. During the Eastern Expedition of the Dian-Gui Army, it was once a battlefield. Yang Kunru, the Cantonese army commander guarding Huizhou City, was miserably defeated here. Thinking carefully about the ghosts on that battlefield, I couldn't help but resent them for not staying to die in today's national resistance war. They wasted the value of their lives too much. However, this time our garrison did not set up defenses and allowed the × army to cross the river swaggeringly. It was a bit lonely. Now, there is nothing on the swirling river surface, only more than ten ships that were burned by the × people, broken masts and broken oars, reflected on the green river, stimulating the traveler.

We did not stay in Boluo for long, because we wanted to reach Sucun before sunset. Tan Gongye, more than ten miles from Boluo City, is as dangerous as Jiantan. There is a Tan Gong Temple on the mountain by the shore. According to folklore, boats must burn incense and pray silently when passing by here, otherwise it will be unlucky. The "Bodhisattva" will also collect "water money". This area has always been a haunt for bandits, and we were also wary. Everyone held their guns and stared vigilantly. Fortunately, we were safe and sound. We couldn't help but admire the power of the gun in our hearts. (To be continued)

Transportation and Travel

### To the People Who Are Going to Kunming

— Xia Luo

Friends: Do you feel the air is dull? Do you feel mentally exhausted? Do you feel the cost of living is too high? Have you ever felt that you can't read books? Then, prepare your luggage immediately, leave this dull Hong Kong Island, return to our homeland, paradise, and go to Kunming. Let me introduce everything here to you as far as I know.

The weather in Kunming is the clearest! Under the clear blue sky, it is full of golden sunlight all day long. Living in such fresh air and warm sunlight always makes people happy. In terms of climate change, the four seasons are the same. It is green everywhere, and it is peaceful every day. There are two lines of poetry: "The four seasons are spring and summer, and one rain turns into winter." It is the most appropriate portrayal. The rainy season is in late summer and early autumn, and it rarely rains on other days.

The scenery of Kunming: There is a quiet West Mountain here. I once lived the life of a hermit in their monastery for a week. I climbed to the top of the mountain to watch the sunrise in the early morning and listened to the bell of the temple in the evening. It really made me feel infinite nostalgia! There is also Ming Lake, which is as blue as a gem. Boating on the moonlit night is the most poetic. There are many other famous mountains and scenic spots, which make people feel like they are in Peiping, and it is known as Little Peiping. However, foreign foreigners will praise in unison: Little Switzerland in the frozen East.

Cost of living: Kunming is, after all, a small inland city, and the cost of living was originally very low. However, after the Anti-Japanese War, the number of people who escaped from the coastal cities to this place increased day by day, so this small mountain city suddenly became prosperous. Department stores, cinemas, and large hotels sprang up one after another, and the old Kunming city was also modernized. However, the cost of living is also rising day by day - in the past, old flag tickets were used as a unit of buying and selling! Now it takes at least the central currency. As for the exact amount of the cost of living! It is difficult to have a standard, depending on the economic situation of each person. Let's take ordinary students as an example: food costs seven or eight yuan per month, as for pocket money, entertainment expenses, book purchase expenses, etc., those who are more economically well-off can naturally buy a little more. If I have to say a total amount, I can generally say that, excluding food expenses, ten dollars a month is enough.

Things to prepare when coming: In Kunming, foreign goods are quite expensive, not cheaper than domestic goods. Don't bring too many kinds of foreign goods when you come. If they are discovered by the maritime customs, they will be taken away. I think it is best to buy less. This point should be noted first. The atmosphere in Kunming is quite low in temperature in winter and usually in the morning and evening, so you should bring a quilt. There are mosquitoes in summer, so don't forget to bring a mosquito net. Because there are many foreign female students here, their clothing and accessories are almost the same as in Guangzhou. In winter, they wear coats, and in summer, they wear short-sleeved cheongsams, high heels, and curled hair. In short, bring whatever you wear in Guangzhou.

You must think that Kunming is very desolate and old, right? But after you come, you will be surprised, because the streets are full of the latest and brightest cars; everywhere you look, you see young and beautiful gentlemen and fragrant and modern ladies; what you touch is the music of radio broadcasts. In the sound cinema, when the movie starts, there will be a burst of local dialect interpretation, just like in the silent film era in Guangzhou. This is the characteristic of Kunming City. Rescue work is done as usual, but unfortunately, it is mostly official and not noticed by people. It's really a bit painful.

Here, in addition to Yunnan University, the Southwest Associated University, the Central Research Institute, the Chung Cheng Medical College, and the National College of Technology have moved here. Now Zhongda has also moved here. Kunming is about to become a new cultural center, adding a lot of popularity. As for the newly added drawing paper publications, there are many more, such as the famous Tianjin Yishi Daily. It costs about 50 Hong Kong dollars to go from Hong Kong to Kunming, Yunnan via Annam. If you come with a group, it will be more economical. That's all I can tell you for now.

Students staying in Hong Kong and Macau, do not live in this colony. This is really your paradise, really for you to develop. On the one hand, open your books, and on the other hand, do some rescue work. Come on, come to Kunming, and we'll talk more when we have the chance. Sincerely, Xia Luo

Kunming Scenery (Above and Below)

### Crossing the Abdomen of Fujian: From Nanping to Yong'an

Nanping's position is strategically located at the center of Fujian Province. The Jianxi, Futunxi, and Shaxi rivers converge here and flow south to form the Min River. Therefore, due to its advantageous geographical location, Nanping has become the main transportation hub in northern Fujian. Since the expansion and construction of highways in southwestern Fujian, Shaxian and Yong'an can lead to Yancheng, Changting, and Longyan in the west, reaching the border between Fujian and Guangdong. Another route can reach Datian, Yihua, and Yongchun in the south, directly approaching the coastal areas. Therefore, Nanping is currently a key point for transportation between southwestern and central Fujian. The Fujian Provincial Government moved its administration to Yong'an in western Fujian in May of last year, establishing a new provincial capital. Subsequently, the political and cultural center of the province shifted westward, making Nanping even more important today. Two years ago, the reporter lived in Nanping for some time. Now, upon revisiting, I truly feel that it has undergone a complete transformation. The second day after New Year's Day was marked by continuous rain and cold weather, comparable to that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

The slow train heading west from Nanping Station departs at 7:30 AM. After the train leaves Nanping, it runs along the Shaxi River. With mountains on the left and water on the right, the scenery along the way is indeed pleasant. Unfortunately, the train travels bumpily. After less than two hours, the head starts to feel dizzy, and the mood to enjoy the scenery is completely shattered.

The upper reaches of the Min River have sluggish water flow, with numerous shoals and rocks occupying most of the riverbed. Occasionally, a solitary sail can be seen, ultimately giving the impression that this river is not suitable for navigation. The interior of Fujian is rich in abundant resources. Once developed, the geographical advantages will be immense. However, the development of transportation is a prerequisite. Although the expansion of inland highways in Fujian Province has achieved considerable results, work on surveying and mapping waterways is still needed. The War of Resistance has made us aware of many things that we previously overlooked. After this war, I believe that the development of all localities will undoubtedly accelerate and become an important foundation for national construction and prosperity.

Three hours after leaving Nanping, the train arrives at Shaxian, with a stop of more than half an hour. The station and the county seat are separated by a stream, with boats shuttling back and forth. Shaxian is currently an important place in Fujian Province. In another article, the reporter once compared it to "Whampoa before the Northern Expedition and Lushan before the War of Resistance," because various training programs to mobilize resistance forces in Fujian Province are held here. Tens of thousands of strong men and women receive new combat education here and then spread throughout Fujian Province, shouldering the arduous task of mobilizing the people. Gazing at the opposite shore, I cannot help but feel infinite respect for that city wall that embraces new life and nurtures the land.

The station is crowded and noisy, with most of the people being civil servants and soldiers. At the head and tail of the station, there are large oil paintings depicting scenes of beacon fires, angry faces, and sturdy, sharp bayonets and broadswords, fully highlighting the tense atmosphere of this place.

After the passengers finish lunch, the train continues westward. From here, the mountains overlap, and the highway is mostly carved along the mountainsides. The road surface is relatively narrow and uneven. The train travels more bumpily than the previous section. Climbing over the mountains, it twists and turns, making people feel anxious and afraid to look down. According to people on the train, this section of the highway used to be much worse and is currently being actively improved. Sure enough, we encountered many laborers along the way, in groups, repairing roads, chiseling mountains, and filling earth, all sweating profusely. As the train passed, they put down their hammers and hoes, or stopped their feet carrying mud, and watched attentively. I remember reading an article somewhere that said: "During this War of Resistance, the soldiers at the front resisting the enemy's artillery with their flesh and blood are admirable, but the hard-working compatriots in the rear who are sweating to maintain transportation and delivery are also worthy of our gratitude." As the car window swept past their honest and simple faces, respect arose in my heart.

Along the highway, we saw many碉堡 (碉堡, I'm not certain of what this means, but it's being translated as "碉堡" for now), which were built in the past to prevent bandits. To the west of the Shaxi River, we also saw two city walls, presumably the former county seat that has been abandoned. These fortresses are specifically designed to defend against bandits from within. In today's War of Resistance against Japan, I believe that their usefulness has been completely lost. Not only have they lost their usefulness, but I am afraid they may even provide resources for the ×× (left untranslated as there were characters missing) and cause infinite harm. This is because these city walls and fortresses cannot withstand the attacks of the ×× (left untranslated as there were characters missing)'s modern weapons in terms of defense. Once occupied by the ×× (left untranslated as there were characters missing), they can be used to defend against our Jinan battles. Looking at the vast Jinan area today, how many cities, once occupied by the ×× (left untranslated as there were characters missing), are difficult to recover? It can be seen that the fortress is harmful rather than beneficial today and must be demolished immediately.

After the car passes ×× (left untranslated as there were characters missing) Town and travels for a while, we suddenly see a bright national flag flying high in the sky. As we approached, a flat square appeared before our eyes. The loud commands of "Attention!" and "At ease!" burst out from there. A team of armed soldiers was practicing martial arts to kill the ×× (left untranslated as there were characters missing) on the square. At the exit of the square, facing the highway, stands a stone archway with a blue background, and the horizontal inscription reads four large white characters, 'Awaiting Orders to Advance.' This solemn and tragic scene stimulated all the passengers in the car, and everyone stopped talking and joking, paying silent respect to the armed compatriots in the square and the national flag flying in the sky.

This can be said to be the new atmosphere of the Yansha Yong Road. When the reporter passed this road two years ago, it was just a scene of desolation and sadness. Now, not only are the villages gradually becoming cleaner, but the barren fields along the way are also covered with green wheat seedlings. It can be seen that the Fujian Province's promotion of winter cultivation to increase production has yielded results, and the people, after receiving considerable education, also show signs of a new transformation.

Although traveling on the Yansha waterway is difficult, the things seen during this journey from east to west across the abdomen of Fujian Province have brought great joy to the reporter.

The train arrives at Yong'an Station at 3:30 PM, allowing us to see the new atmosphere of this small mountain town, the new capital of Fujian!

### —Shipping Special—

The Taishan ship arrived in Hong Kong from Macau yesterday morning. According to the captain of the ship, when passing through the sea area at 22°13'30" North latitude and 113°40'30" East longitude, many floating obstacles were found. Ships sailing through that area should pay attention to navigation.

The Blue Funnel Line ship, the Xian Fu Ya, represented by Butterfield & Swire, came to Hong Kong some time ago to be repaired at the Taikoo Dockyard. The repairs were completed yesterday, and a test voyage was conducted in Hong Kong harbor in the afternoon. The results were satisfactory, and the ship will depart tomorrow for Singapore and Fremantle.

A Hungarian ship, named the Bissi Paz, arrived yesterday. According to investigations, the ship came from Keelung and entered the Taikoo Dockyard for repairs. No cargo was transported. The local agent is the Jielianbu Company.

### Scenery Along the Highways of Guangxi Province and Its Vicinity (3)

— Pan Taifeng

Traveling eighty-four kilometers east from Binyang, one arrives at Gui, located on the left bank of the Yu River. Cars on the highway, whether from Wuzhou, Guangzhou Bay, or Liuzhou, all stay overnight here, so it has become lively after the war. There are many mountains in the county, among which the reserves of tungsten are 35 million tons. Agricultural products include lotus root and lotus root powder. Ten li away, there is Nanshan. Twenty-four li away, in Guanyan Cave, there are scenic spots such as stone Guanyan, stone elephants, stone carp, Dan stove, and flying bell. At the summit, there are Yixian Cave, Baiyun Residence, and Zhenyi Rock. At the foot of the mountain is Nanshan Temple. Legend has it that Emperor Jianwen of the Ming Dynasty once lived in seclusion here. The trees are shaded, and the environment is quiet and pleasant. It is now used as Zhongshan Park, where the Wanwang Pavilion is built to commemorate Shi Dakai, the Yi King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Longyan is fifty li to the east. The surface of the rock is wide and can accommodate thousands of people. There is a stone dragon on it, dozens of feet long, lifelike. Stalactites form figures, flowers, and birds, all lifelike. Donghu Lake in the east of the city has a mirror-like surface. Su Shi once visited here.

Three, the Liuyi Line, from Liuzhou to Yongning, is 280 kilometers long and consists of sandy and gravel roads. The 168 kilometers from Liuzhou to Binyang are combined with the Yuweng Line. From Binyang, it travels southwest, crossing the Fangshan Mountain to Yongning, a distance of 112 kilometers, passing through Luxu, Tanxu, Taishou, Enlong, Maling, Batang, Dalu, Wutang, Sitang, Ertang, and Shizhan. The section from Binyang to Wutang was opened in the tenth year of the Republic of China with complete specifications. In the fourteenth year, it continued to extend south. In June of the sixteenth year, construction was completed and traffic was opened. There are currently 122 bridges and many permanent bridges. There are 663 culverts. The maximum slope is 12%.

Four, the Liuli Line, from Liuzhou northwest to Liuzhai, at the junction of Guizhou and Guangxi, is 329 kilometers long. The 59 kilometers from Liuzhou to Datang are combined with the Yangyu and Liuyu lines. From Datang, it passes through Ouji, Liji, Qingyuan, Yishan, Yuanzhou, Taiping, Desheng, Sanjiangkou, Jiadao, Liuxu, Hechi, Fengmu, Babu, Chehe, Daxu, Nandan, Xindian, Mangchang, and Baping nineteen stations to Liuzhai. The road surface is paved with sand and gravel. There are 59 permanent bridges, 105 semi-permanent bridges, 845 permanent culverts, and 23 semi-permanent culverts. The maximum slope is 14%. The minimum radius of the curve is 18 meters. The Hechi Liuzhai section was first surveyed in the eighth year of the Republic of China. Construction was started in the twenty-first year after several interruptions and completed in the twenty-second year. It was extensively repaired again in the twenty-fourth year, so the project is still solid. However, the road surface is opened along the mountain, and rain and mudslides often cause damage.

This line is now managed by the Southwest Highway Transportation Administration and is included in the national highway network. Passing through Liuzhai and entering Guizhou Province, it is 303 kilometers to Guizhou. Accommodation and dining facilities on this line are contracted by the China Travel Service, so passenger transportation is handled most satisfactorily. As for freight transportation, due to the fall of the southeast, it has suddenly become busy. Although there are public and private vehicles going there, the goods are still piled up like mountains and difficult to clear. It can be said to be a unique feature in the history of highway transportation in our country.

### Wuxi Industry Today

— Caihua

Large Factories Prefer to Rely on Others, Small Silk Factories Can Be Self-Reliant (Continued)

【Note】Supervisors are all Japanese, and the actual administrators are nominal. There are a total of 2,554 silk reeling machines.

At the same time, in the silk industry, it is worth mentioning that some silk factory employees are very principled and creative. On the one hand, they are unwilling to seek employment in the China Central Company, and on the other hand, for the sake of their family's livelihood, they cannot tighten their belts. Under these circumstances, a large number of small family-run silk factories have emerged. These small silk factories have a maximum of eight to twelve machines, and some have only four machines. The most have twenty machines. All silk machines and machinery were purchased from destroyed factories at extremely low prices of twenty to thirty yuan per machine. The so-called factory buildings are in the homes, and the silk machines and machinery are installed simply. They work day and night, and the output is considerable, and they can also obtain considerable profits. "Self-reliance" is truly admirable!

(4) Rice Industry

The next is the rice industry. Originally, there were many rice shops in the area outside the North Gate. Because of the heavy losses suffered in this war, there are now about 70 or more that have resumed business or been newly established. The scope of business is not as good as before the war. Now, it is limited to doing small business in the city and cannot even talk about exporting. Even if it is possible to export, it must be done in cooperation with the Japanese. Not only are the donation and tax procedures troublesome, but it is also very dangerous.

In short, Wuxi's current industry is only one-tenth of what it was before the war. It is a dark mess, with the clutches of exploitation reaching everywhere. Rather than eking out a living under the heavy oppression of the Japanese, it is better to move the factory inland and engage in production needed for the War of Resistance. This will not only allow the unemployed to return to the factory and participate in production, but also develop inland industries, which will benefit the country and the nation.

### Most Members of the Philippine Inter-City Soccer Team Are Skilled in Basketball; May Arrange Several Performances with Strong Teams Upon Arrival in Hong Kong; Shanghai Public Opinion Unanimously Approves of Huitang Going North to Plead for Refugees

[Special Report from this Newspaper] After the Hong Kong-Philippines Inter-City Soccer Game was scheduled for February 19 (Lunar New Year), the General Association has been actively preparing. The Hong Kong team representatives will also be selected soon. The selection committee is confident about this, and Li Huitang's position as coach has also been internally determined.

Huitang told reporters yesterday that the General Association should select the Hong Kong team representatives as soon as possible, and then choose a date to hold a practice match so that all players can have a tacit understanding of cooperation before the big battle.

It is also reported that more than half of the Philippine team representatives are university students and are also skilled in basketball. If time permits, they may arrange several performances with strong teams upon arrival in Hong Kong.

According to Shanghai newspapers, the International Relief Committee has invited Li Huitang to come north to participate in charity soccer matches. It has been decided to hold two matches during the Lunar New Year, generally between the Chinese League and the Western League, and between the Eastern China and Lido. The dates are February 20 and 21, and the venues are all the Albers Road Yiyuan Stadium. (Note: Huitang has now decided to represent the Hong Kong team in the inter-city game, so the trip to Shanghai must be rescheduled.)

Shanghai public opinion unanimously approves of Huitang's agreement to go north to plead for refugees and hopes that Hong Kong can send more famous generals to join the Chinese League. (Donglang)

### The South China Football Team's Southern Expedition: Night Battle Breaks the Southern Vietnamese Police, South China Gains the Upper Hand and Wins 5-1

(Saigon Airmail Special Dispatch) The Hong Kong South China Football Team, on this trip to Vietnam, first won against the Western Union team, and then against the New Public Ado-xiang United team. These consecutive victories established a foundation for long-term success, truly deserving their reputation. Their football skills are undoubtedly superior, unlike those who violate sportsmanship. Western newspapers have commented extensively on this, and there is a reason for it. Last night, the 11th, the team clashed with the Police team at the Saigon Stone Stadium, their third battle since arriving in Vietnam. What attracted the most attention was that the Police team was a strong force here, undefeated in 1938 and had firmly grasped this year's Southern Vietnamese championship. They practiced day and night, possessing unique advantages, so many football fans worried about the South China team, and many bet on their victory or defeat. That night, the audience's pulse was tense, and their enthusiasm was boiling, no less than the athletes in the competition. Fortunately, the South China team players were highly skilled and calm in the face of battle, and were able to handle it with ease and win. Overall, this performance was the most exciting of all the previous matches, and the audience was also the largest that night, truly a unprecedented scene. The details of the battle are recorded below:

The weather was slightly cool that night, refreshing the mind. The lights were just turned on, and pedestrians and vehicles were flowing in the streets. In the Stone Stadium, the electric lights illuminated the area like daylight. On the green turf, barefoot immortals were active, busy practicing. Those who have seen the sea find it difficult to be impressed by other waters. One only feels that the ants are attached, like children playing hide-and-seek, chasing back and forth, falling east and west. The enthusiasm was present, and the human wall around the stadium was already impenetrable. Before long, at nine o'clock, the athletes of the South China and Police teams appeared on the field amidst thunderous applause. Each was full of energy and high morale. As the referee blew the silver whistle, the charge began. South China immediately adopted an offensive posture. The five forwards formed a united force, rushing towards the Police team from the shouts. A central breakthrough, and the defense was unable to retreat in time. In the blink of an eye, the goalkeeper, at a loss, was taken by surprise, and Chen Dehui hit the target with one arrow, and the whole stadium cheered. It was only three minutes after the start of the game. The Police team, stung by the blow, were unwilling to give in. Under the command of Commander Zheng, the three armies immediately launched a fierce counterattack against South China. Both wings expanded and advanced simultaneously. Liu Qingcai's central line was actually crossed. Li Tiansheng tried hard to defend the city, but the Police team's strategy was cunning and strange, maneuvering while launching sneak attacks. Li Tiansheng's iron wall was restrained, unable to use its strength. Mai Shaohan could not rush to the rescue in time. With a bang, goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai actually let the ball slip into the goal. The score was tied. The gain and loss were also in an instant. The two kinds of emotions in the audience erupted into huge waves of sound, and their tense expressions were also different. South China also counterattacked, with Liu Songsheng lightly riding on the street, Feng Jingxiang coordinating in the center, and Yang Shuiyi assisting. After a chaotic battle, they had already forced a corner kick. Li Zhaorong raised his foot to shoot, but the Police team's goalkeeper caught it. Yang Shuiyi added another kick, sweeping it into the goal. It was so close, a pity. Li Zhaorong then knocked on the door again. The ball was rolling on the ground with force, but it was still a little short, which was a pity. After that, they went back and forth, and after a few rounds, Liu Qingcai was experienced and prudent, calmly plotting his success, taking the opportunity to intercept the incoming ball, passing through the enemy's vital fortress, and passing it to Jingxiang with short passing skills. Liu Songsheng responded with a single horse on the border, and it was indeed a brilliant move. The Police team was almost forced to make a city alliance. The defender had a sudden inspiration, and then "grabbed Buddha's feet in a hurry." Although Songsheng glared with anger, he had no choice but to show mercy. The referee, seeing his cunning, penalized a free kick, which was taken by Feng Jingxiang, but fearing that the victory would be unchivalrous, he only kicked it lightly, but the goalkeeper was too hasty and failed to block it. The ball went into the net. They fought each other, chasing and fleeing, and the situation became more tense. The two sides fought each other and refused to give way. Before long, Yang Shuiyi got the ball and shot it like an arrow. Fortunately, the Police team had great fortune, hitting the post directly and bouncing out. However, the South China team members never felt discouraged. Liu Songsheng, the Shenxing Taibao, became more and more brave, and Feng Jingxiang, who rose and fell like a rabbit, also became more and more skilled, and guerrilla tactics were launched. The enemy was already exhausted, passing the ball slowly. Chen Dehui and Li Zhaorong were responsible for rushing forward. The ball was like a shuttle weaving back and forth. During the competition, Liu Songsheng dribbled the ball and rushed straight to the Police team's city gate, as if entering no man's land, about to raise his foot to shoot. However, the Police team's defender came up and grabbed him, "shaking hands to make peace, wanting to implement a friendly policy." Liu was restrained, resulting in failure again. The referee penalized another ball, but unfortunately Jingxiang failed to shoot it in. Before long, they were forced to make a corner kick, but fortunately there was no loss. The two rescues of the Great Iron Shovel could not be achieved. Then Jingxiang passed the ball up, and Li Zhaorong made a surprise attack, unhurried and calmly scoring another goal. The first half ended with South China winning 3-1.

Changing the sides to fight again, both teams were forced to corner kicks one after another, but nothing was gained. At this point, the war frequently occurred at the Police team's city gate. A certain member of the team was exceptionally brave, and when a certain member of the South China team rushed to shoot, he "grabbed and dragged him with his hand," and was penalized again, but South China also failed to achieve anything. Once again, Chen Dehui rushed into the city, and the Police team "strictly held him tightly", hugging him tightly, pretending to be a ballroom dance, so he could do nothing. The ball was also empty. However, the Police team's city gate had been in chaos for a long time. Then, they each had corner kicks, but no achievements were made. The Police team was cornered again, and Liu Songsheng took the kick. Feng Jingxiang headed the ball, and the ball broke into the net. The war began to trend violently. The Chinese team lost a corner kick, and the Police team forwards surged forward, but they failed to hit the target after many shots, and the ball flew over the net. The police still tried their best to rush into the city, and Zhang Rongcai was knocked to the ground, suffering a little bit, but fortunately there was no major problem. At this point, the Chinese team's morale was greatly angered, and their energy increased sharply, passing the ball back and forth, following the same pattern. Feng Jingxiang passed it to Zhaorong, who scored another goal. Before long, the ceasefire order was issued, and South China won a great victory with five to one. However, under the watchful eyes of everyone, the close-range combat did not allow the frontline's charge, which was due to the tension of the Police team, and it was also one of the most exciting scenes. The South China lineup is as follows (sent by Zhu Zhaohong):

Zhang Rongcai

Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan, Li Guowei, Liu Qingcai, Liu Weipei, Liu Songsheng, Li Zhaorong, Chen Dehui, Feng Jingxiang, Yang Shuiyi

### Gymnastics and Physical Fitness (4)

— Wang Xuezheng

(1) Stand upright, separate your feet about one foot apart, stretch your arms above your head, rotate your hands, stand firmly, lean your upper body forward, right, back, left, form a circle, the larger the circle, the better. After rotating ten or twelve circles, continue to spin forward, left and right also rotate in the same way. As for the breathing method, it is best to exhale when the body moves, and pause slightly after completing one circle, while inhaling.

This exercise mainly strengthens the waist, abdomen, and buttocks.

(2) This exercise is similar to the previous one, but instead put your hands on your waist, and place one foot on a chair about 18 inches high, concentrating the weight of the upper body on the other leg. First place your left foot on the chair, and rotate your upper body left and right five times each. After finishing, place your right foot on the chair, and rotate your upper body in the same way.

(3) Stand upright, with your arms hanging down at your sides. First, kick your right leg to the left, as high as possible. At the same time, swing your arms to the right to maintain the balance of your body. Alternate between the left and right legs, and the movements should be harmonious. The knees should not be bent. Do ten to twelve times for each leg. Inhale when kicking the left or right leg, and exhale when putting it down.

This exercise can also be performed lying on the ground, which is very beneficial for the arms and thighs.

(4) Stretch your body straight and lie on your back on the ground. Bend and sit up, bending your upper body forward as much as possible, until your fingers touch your toes. Do a total of ten to fifteen times. Exhale when bending and sitting up, and inhale when lying back.

This exercise is not only a good abdominal exercise, but also stretches the muscles of the back and waist, and increases the flexibility of the body.

(5) Crawling on the ground is actually a very good exercise. In addition to stretching the muscles of all parts of the body and making the body develop evenly, it can also strengthen the back and make the internal organs function actively and normally. When crawling, the legs should not be bent too much, and the arms should also be straight. First crawl forward, then backward. Breathing should be deep and even.

(6) Stand upside down on the ground, with your legs straight and perpendicular to the ground, and your hands supporting your waist to maintain your body's balance. Then alternately stretch your legs backwards as much as possible. The upper body should not move. When one leg stretches backwards, the other leg must remain perpendicular to the ground. Breathing should be even: do ten to fifteen times for each leg.

This exercise requires control of the abdominal muscles and is beneficial for the thighs, buttocks, and waist.

The greatest effect of the six exercises introduced this time is to maintain the balance of the body. The correct posture of the body is a prerequisite for "health" and "beauty". If the body cannot be balanced, it will not be able to take the correct posture. The center of gravity of the body is in the buttocks, but the parts most closely related to the buttocks are the legs, abdomen, and waist. This time, our exercise also focuses on strengthening these parts. (End)

### Movies and Theater

Entertainment...The Baroness and the Butler

Originally a famous stage play, now adapted into a movie, the story itself has a strong comedic flavor, and the hard work of the humorous star William Powell and Anna Bella has made this film an excellent and successful work.

William Powell plays a waiter who is the most capable servant in the Earl's family. He handles all aspects of housework in an orderly manner, and the entire Earl's family is very satisfied with him. But unexpectedly, this waiter is secretly engaged in political activities and is elected as a member of parliament, and is standing on the side of the party that is opposed to his master. In his profession, he is a loyal servant, but in politics, he publishes political opinions and meticulously attacks his master. The Earl is considered broad-minded and has a corresponding understanding of him. The most unconvinced is the Earl's daughter, a standard noble lady (played by Anna Bella), and under this situation of disputes and contradictions, a series of jokes are made.

There are extremely wonderful dialogues in the film, and there is truth in the humor and wit. William Powell's style has not changed. In his calmness, there is a place where people can be stunned. Anna Bella is still appearing in an American-made film for the first time in this film, and she also has an extremely excellent performance.

Queen...Touchdown Army

Most of this film is based on the West Point Military Academy in the United States, showing strict discipline and neat exercises, and interspersing a triangular love comedy, and ending with a tense and lively football game. This kind of story's material has been seen countless times, but the performance of the whole drama still has considerable achievements.

The content describes a frivolous playboy who is willing to enter the military academy for a woman and endure all kinds of hardships. Unexpectedly, the woman's hard work has already belonged to someone else. Later, because of his superb football skills, he made a big splash and won the woman's favor.

Most of the football games and exercises in the film are edited from current affairs films, but because of the skillful technology, it does not show any traces. John Howard plays a small teacher in the film, not as exciting as his detective films.

Peace...White Banners

Adapted from the recent book "Self-Flag" by the writer Wright Douglas, the story itself is very interesting. The script of this play is well-made, and the arrangement of the actors is also appropriate. The performance of the whole film is extremely moving. Because it is too ethical, it may not be of interest to the general public, but if you watch it patiently, it will give people a feeling that it is desirable.

Clauto Lens has always performed very well, and this time he plays a teacher who loves his work, and his performance can be said to be immersive. In addition, several supporting actors, such as Fei Feide, Jacques Cooper, and the child star Nite Tagrenville, who has always played villain roles, have changed their style and played an enthusiastic girl, all of whom are excellent and satisfying.

Oriental...Mad About Music

A very touching tragicomedy, some parts of the story are relatively weak, but because of the comedy relationship, it is not a problem. The director has handled the whole film very tightly, and every progress can grasp the humor of the comedy.

Dina Dopi's performance is extremely wonderful, several songs are also very moving, and the supporting roles are also perfect.

Dahua...The Adventures of Tom Sawyer

It is a very tolerant literary film, which is adapted from Mark Twain's book. Although the whole film is very long, the director has handled it properly. The light and lively tone makes us not feel bored. Part of it is also due to the outstanding performances of a generation of child stars, especially the two protagonists. Mei Zasun, who plays the aunt, also performs very well.

King Star...Divorce of Lady X

A funny love film, the story is of course lacking in possibility. The whole film is set on a foggy night in London. A large group of people looking for pleasure in the hotel were forced to not go back and had to look for rooms in the hotel. As a result, a husband (Maner Obelran) broke into the room of a single male guest, and the story unfolded like this.

The interest is quite strong, but it is still too late for the British style. The whole film is dyed with color, which adds a lot of beauty.

New World...The One True Love Seed

Starring Xu Manli and Kuang Shanxiao

Central...The Pearl Shirt

It was not long before Chen Zhaoli of Hollywood passed away, and the Chinese film industry produced Chen Zhaoli. This kind of speculative plan does not require publicity and can reap the benefits of the box office. The intelligence of Chinese filmmakers can be seen here. However, the arrangement of the content and story of this film is not perfect. At the same time, each tense scene has not been fully developed. The description of the behavior of the bandits is more failure than success. The distribution of actors is also not very suitable. Except for Liu Qiong, who has considerable success, Gu Lanjun and Hong Jingling did not do much in the play. Xu Huayuan's Chen Zhaoli. The facial makeup is quite similar, but the imitation of the movements is still not satisfactory.

### Dr. Huang Zhuoru specializes in treating chronic toxic diseases that have not been cured

The difficulty of treating toxic diseases is well known. Although there are various reasons, it is nothing more than teeth invading the urethral diverticulum and its surrounding tissues, so there is no way to eradicate the invasive bacteria. Therefore, the treatment device sucks out the toxic system from the urethral diverticulum and then injects the medicine. The urethral diverticulum naturally attracts, and at the same time makes the mucosa congest. Bacteria work vigorously, promoting the absorption of diseased cell infiltration, and toxic diseases can be cured. If you have the same disease, why not give it a try. 27 Dede Road Central, Hong Kong, 2nd Floor, Tel: 121444

### Tongguan Bombardment

— Qiu Yang

Low houses, the tile roofs piled with several layers of yellow dust, the residents all moved to the countryside! Letting the roofs be blasted open by the Japanese invaders' cannons, or the walls pierced through. Especially the area near the east side of the station. Whether they were bombs from airplanes, or heavy shells flying from across the Yellow River, people inside didn't have time to escape. They didn't care about shells or bombs. All they could remember forever was that our houses were destroyed by Japanese devils.

This is Tongguan. It occupies the border of the three provinces of Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi. It is a major defense for the Northwest. It has a glorious history. Two majestic city towers stand tall, though it's said that a part was demolished to reduce targets for the invaders. But it still overlooks everything on the banks of the Yellow River.

The sky looks like it's going to snow. Heavy dark clouds cover the vast expanse of the sky. The north wind cuts like sharp scissors, attacking the skin of the soldiers, carrying with it a lingering, nauseating smell of sulfur and smoke from the mountains outside the city, into this deserted city.

The Yellow River comes down from the north, makes a turn here, and flows east. Along the southern bank of the river, across the Longhai Railway, for several miles along the mountains, countless brave soldiers are ambushed under solid fortifications. The gunners are constantly transporting shells to the shooters. The thick smoke and the thunderous sound invigorate and excite every soldier, making them forget the cold, forget the fatigue.

"Bombard the invaders' artillery positions! Discovered! Quick!"

"Thirty-five degrees, inclined aim!"

The battalion commander, using his binoculars, excitedly jumped and shouted, then put down the binoculars, measured the proper angle, and ordered the gunner to fire.

The invaders' shells seemed to have discovered this artillery position. The shells exploded a hundred meters away, fragments of rock and yellow-black dust flying in all directions. One by one, they hit the solid loess, creating deep pits. The battalion commander's horse was wounded, neighing and jumping, blood flowing from its belly. Then three orderlies also fell, a piece of their head blown off, their hands grasping at the air, their feet twitching once or twice, and then nothing. Their dead heads soaked in a pool of blood.

The heavy artillery roared towards the opposite bank, and the yellow, desolate beachhead over there likewise rose up with yellow dust, rushing towards the sky.

The battalion commander jumped up excitedly. "That's right, damn it! Fire again!" He held the binoculars in his left hand, and gripped a shell lying on the ground in his right hand.

The gunners were sweating, their faces flushed with excitement.

After a long time, the invaders' cannons stopped firing. This side also stopped firing. The battalion commander quietly turned around, stood at attention, bowed his head in silent mourning for the dead orderlies. The artillerymen also stood up to offer a solemn tribute to the fallen.

The north bank is desolate. In the distance, there are black things, like wrecked vehicles, standing motionless. The Yellow River flows with yellow, muddy water. The Longhai Railway on the south bank bends along the mountains, around behind the mountains. In this lonely land, not a single person is seen. Tongguan stands peacefully.

— Chen Shih-huai

In the early days of the revolution, the poet D. Bedny was undoubtedly a shining star in the Soviet poetry scene. The title of "Poet Laureate" belonged to him. However, the rise and fall of writers, like the fluctuations of society, are inevitable. After 1923, the Soviet Union began a period of proletarian poetry writing. The dazzling title of this "Poet Laureate" fell upon a young poet, Bexymensky. Bexymensky had a deep understanding of politics and a surprisingly firm ideology. His themes lacked any traditional sentimentality. "Let others think of spring!" he said.

"But I walk and walk, and stubbornly

Think of the capital of Soviet food."

Or:

"Some worry about girls' lips,

But I worry about chimneys."

He was such a rigid and calm man, but life had a good taste for him. His first book was called "That's How Life Tastes."

Bexymensky's style differed from those influenced by the Symbolist school earlier, such as the "Forge" group. His works were similar to Mayakovsky's. He fully accepted Mayakovsky's crude and exaggerated grammar. However, after Mayakovsky committed suicide, he criticized Mayakovsky again. That is to say, he was learning from Mayakovsky with a critical attitude.

His dramatic poem "The Shot" written in 1930 revealed his keen understanding of politics. During the period of the Five-Year Plan, he was the most enthusiastic writer supporting the government's policies. Long poems such as "Tragic Night" and "Night of the Political Commissar" are all about the Five-Year Plan. Therefore, some people say that Bexymensky's success lay in politics, not in poetry. In fact, another factor in his success was that he often tried his best to achieve "popularization" in his poetry. He wrote poems on the road, next to the kiosk, in the theater boxes, not in his room. The nationwide fame of his poetry cannot be separated from the warm welcome of the Soviet people.

### Marching Notes

— Li Huiying

His fish shop has two storefronts. The shop floor is very empty, making it the most suitable place for us to rest. This fish shop is very much like a "trust." All the fish carriers from outside have to go to the shop first and then sell them outside. We haven't seen a single carrier selling fish alone on the street. Such a special product of exploitation is the first time I've seen in the countryside. Even if you stop the carrier and want to trade directly with the fisherman, he will still shake his head and refuse. The locals love to eat fish, and the fish prices are indeed very cheap. In the morning, the entrance of the fish shop is crowded with people. The fish shop owner stands high on a long table, specializing in weighing fish. There are also people collecting money and taking care of the baskets.

"Three hundred ah!" After weighing the fish, the owner shouts this out, drawing out the end sound. The buyer takes the fish from the scale with the basket, and then pays the money to the cashier. This is always the procedure, and people come and go in the hustle and bustle. The owner's shout resounds throughout the entire street:

"One dime ah!——"

"Four hundred ah!——"

I still remember the last time I came here for camping. People were exhausted from walking the day before, and were bitten badly by mosquitoes at night. I really hoped to get a good sleep this morning, but unexpectedly I was awakened by the shouting.

Today, it's noon now. The trading has long ended.

New peanuts are on the market, piled up in heaps. The smoked meat in the restaurant is so tempting. When you become a soldier, you can't imagine how you will turn into a rabbit. Just as when you become a soldier, you will have words like "damn it" hanging on your lips. These are all indispensable phenomena. But when I touch my pocket, it's empty except for a stack of toilet paper, and I lose all hope for everything. No, I'll find another way.

"Old Zhang, treat!"

"What for?"

I pointed to the food displayed on the chopping board at the entrance of the restaurant, expecting a reply.

"No, that stuff isn't clean."

"Then why don't you order some peanuts?"

"That's a good idea."

### Arriving at the Fourth District of Guoyang

Memories of Breaking Through from Xuzhou

After a considerable battle, we didn't reach Xulu until 9 o'clock last night. The Japanese invaders, who ambushed us when we passed through Xulu at night, abandoned three or four hundred corpses and a lot of guns and ammunition, and fled in disarray.

Distributing the captured spoils of war, the team continued to advance mightily.

The sky was clear and cloudless. The sun was terribly hot. The sand and soil on the road were scorched like a red-hot iron pot. The wheat seedlings in the fields lay quietly under the gentle caress of the sun.

There was no wind at all. Bearing a tree branch, dragging two terribly painful feet with blisters that had burst and re-blistered, walking limping on that deadly hot dirt road. I was terribly thirsty, and sweat just kept pouring out.

Suddenly, a Japanese plane appeared in the sky. The advancing troops immediately hid under the trees and in the wheat fields.

The Japanese plane circled overhead once, and after no result, flew away. Then the troops reunited into a stream of iron, advancing.

As soon as we encountered water, even if it was very dirty, people swarmed around like a hive of bees, scrambling to drink it.

It was already past 5 o'clock in the afternoon when we arrived at the fourth district of Guoyang County. This was a fairly large ancient city, but it was already empty. Not a single civilian was left. It is said that the enemy had occupied this place a week ago. Outside the city, there were still enemy telephone lines left behind...

We couldn't find anything to eat in the city. After carrying a few people who hadn't had a good night's sleep, and having a rough meal, unbearable hunger and fatigue led me to a stone bridge, more than ten yards long and more than two yards wide, outside the city, where I sat and waited for the team to depart.

At this time, the sun had just set below the horizon, and the western sky was a brilliant red glow. The evening breeze carried a pleasant coolness, slowly blowing. Under the bridge was half a river of clear water, and three or four ducks, whose owner had fled to who knows where, were freely swimming in the river.

Looking at this poetic scene, a tense heart that had been living in battle every day suddenly became relaxed. We almost forgot that we were breaking through.

Suddenly, a group of people walked over the bridge. Among them were Northeast Army, Sichuan Army, Guangxi Army... Watching their difficult gait, like some small-footed women, twisting their waists as they walked, I almost couldn't help laughing.

In fact, our walking posture was no different from theirs, but we had forgotten our own pain.

After midnight, under the bright moonlight, the team solemnly set out for Guoyang along the highway.

### 10,000 Tons of Knowledge

— Leng Mo

No one needs to worry about the destruction of a culture. Although the birth and growth of a culture is extremely difficult, its preservation and regeneration are quite simple. Because it can be preserved in knowledge, and regeneration through knowledge is not difficult.

The most refined things of a culture are preserved by human brains. The culture that can be regenerated by even an unremarkable modern person's active brain can generally easily amaze our counterparts from five hundred or even two hundred years ago. If humans could imitate such delicate machines as brains, and make them like recording devices and cameras, so that they could be passed down from generation to generation, then the ancient idea of "the universe is all contained within this inch" could truly be realized.

Someone once said that anyone can write a book. This is a limited definition of "book." If we asked everyone to write down everything they know, from how to pick apples to how to connect wireless wires, then each person would certainly write more than their own weight in books. Everyone knows that if everyone really wrote everything down, the resulting works, nineteen of which would be the same, would be an unnecessary and huge waste. But almost no one has ever doubted whether the seemingly necessary waste of each person's brain gradually storing knowledge, nineteen of which are the same as others, is a mistake. Naturally, someone has also said that a superior mind is not able to memorize more than ordinary people, but is able to forget what does not need to be remembered. But this is only regarded as a strange saying.

Humanity's boast, the special skill of being able to communicate complex meanings, is a recent achievement, and its progress is actually very short. All of our tools for communicating meaning are still very clumsy, and the tools for preserving what can be communicated are even clumsier. Bring back the primitive people who wore tree leaves, and they will not understand our rayon clothing. Bring back the prehistoric people who lived in caves, and they will not understand our skyscraper architecture. But bring back the Babylonians and Egyptians who read brick books and papyrus books, and show them our Chinese and Western books, and they will certainly point out without hesitation that these are books.

We can permanently preserve and use brains to preserve culture. What we rely on most is still books. This naturally makes our preservation work more cumbersome, but it is still much more convenient than preserving all cultural products in their original form. Many lost cultural objects can be easily reproduced with book knowledge. The reason we don't do that is probably only because we have put them in the category of things that should be forgotten. Naturally, there are also people who simply do not admit that there are imitations that can match the originals, but that is just a superstition. This superstition exists at the same time as the other belief that genius will find its own way. Since the goal is to surpass one's predecessors, the difference from one's predecessors is naturally not failing to catch up, but throwing them off. Only the antique flavor that collectors praise is created by time. Later generations will naturally be at a disadvantage in terms of time. However, the antique flavor of fake antiques buried for ten years is often enough to confuse the real with the fake, so time is also somewhat controlled. The re-excavation of lost ancient cultures is still a part of cultural work, but those re-excavated things are often prepared to be discarded again, while at the same time the discarding of other aspects is carried out on a massive scale.

When necessary, the tools for preserving culture—books—must also be discarded. The reason why some of them are discarded is because of the books themselves. This provides us with convenience in preservation, but also exposes the weaknesses of our tools, and perhaps at the same time vaguely reveals our psychological dissatisfaction with these tools. This psychology will be the source of progress, but it is also inevitably error-prone. We can now easily reduce errors to a minimum. As far as the preservation of the tool of books is concerned, even if there is a copy of every publication since the invention of books, it probably wouldn't be a very large number. If we preserve all of them, it wouldn't be too cumbersome.

It is necessary to think about what kind of number it is. In my own ordinary brain, I can't remember where I saw it, and I don't know where to find an answer. However, I remember that in a idle talk, someone raised the strange question, "I'm afraid that since the invention of books, mankind has not yet written ten million kinds, right?" This question was also discussed for quite some time. Friends who felt that there were more than this number cited that the US Library of Congress has about nine million volumes of books and magazines, and that England, America, Germany, France, and Russia each publish 10,000 to 20,000 new books every year. If the output of other countries combined is half of the total output of these five countries, then there are more than 100,000 kinds published every year. Since the 20th century, the output has been roughly this amount every year. In the twentieth century there have already been four million new books. Not to mention the forty or so centuries before that. Those who felt that there were only this number thought that if ten million kinds were divided equally among fifty centuries, it would be 200,000 kinds per century. If this were the output in the fifth century BC, no one would think it was too little. Counting backwards and forwards, we estimate that there were two million new books in the nineteenth century, which is also enough to allocate. Moreover, if we assume that each book is of a considerable size, with 300 pages and 200,000 words, and small pamphlets are combined into collections (such as the Old and New Testaments), and duplicates are not counted, then the number of books in the twentieth century may not have reached one million. Ten million is a large number.

If we would rather believe the latter, then its volume is only 10,000 cubic meters, its weight is only 10,000 tons, and its value is only 50 million yuan. According to the printing price of Chinese reprints of Western books, if we print 100 copies of each kind, the total cost would only be 200 million yuan, which is less than one-fifth of the annual expenditure of the American printing industry. This number is almost pitifully small. If only one copy of each existed, and they could be gathered together to destroy them, it wouldn't even need a hundred-pound bomb. However, if the quantity is small, it is easier to preserve. A corner is enough to hide a copy and escape the power of destruction. We can believe that even if the world will have another flood, there will be another Noah's Ark to preserve culture, and that Ark is already big enough.
