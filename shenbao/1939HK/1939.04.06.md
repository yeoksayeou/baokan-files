### On the Understanding of New Conflicts on the Soviet-Puppet Border

Last night, Japanese and foreign news sources reported that a serious conflict occurred again on the morning of the 3rd on the border between the Soviet Union and the puppet state of Manchukuo. The two sides exchanged artillery fire for several hours. The Japanese side also claimed that the Soviet side had launched a large-scale offensive and that the two sides were still in a standoff, with the situation being extremely serious, and that "many soldiers defending the Manchukuo territory were injured." Just as the dispute over the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement had temporarily come to an end due to Japan's capitulation, such a major conflict occurred again on the Soviet-puppet border. Just as one wave subsides, another rises. Moreover, since Japan has already capitulated to the Soviet Union, why would it initiate disputes at this time? To the average person, it may seem very perplexing, but this is an inevitable new trend. It is necessary to have a deeper understanding of the fundamental causes and internal contradictions involved.

Although Japan endured military, political, and even economic losses in resolving the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, it was, in reality, a kind of capitulation to the Soviet Union. However, Japan's capitulation to the Soviet Union is not a sincere or permanent one. Therefore, the disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan cannot be completely eliminated by the temporary resolution of the Fisheries Agreement. The loss of 27 fishing zones and 300,000 yen in new rental fees that Japan endured in signing the new Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement is a secondary issue. However, its political loss is a serious problem. It cannot show the international community that it has capitulated to the Soviet Union. Therefore, after the Fisheries Agreement dispute, it stirred up another new dispute. This constant series of Soviet-Japanese disputes, on the one hand, can show Germany and Italy that it is still preparing to attack the Soviet Union, increasing their friendship with Japan and preventing them from providing aid to China, as was recently reported regarding Germany providing a portion of military supplies and economic assistance to China. On the other hand, it can deceive Britain and France, saying that it has not abandoned its role as the vanguard of capitalist countries in attacking socialist countries, preventing the increase in close relations between Britain and the Soviet Union and between the United States and the Soviet Union.

From the course of this new Soviet-puppet conflict, it can be proven that Japan indeed has the above intentions. Although the Japanese side announced that the new conflict between the Soviet Union and Manchukuo occurred because 23 Soviet soldiers invaded Manchukuo territory and opened fire on the defending forces, shifting the responsibility for the war to the Soviet Union, the news reported by the Harbin foreign news agency was that the Japanese puppet troops first provoked the Soviet defending forces with artillery fire, and later, when Soviet reinforcements arrived, they began to return fire. At a time when Mussolini, following Hitler's annexation of the entire Czech Republic and part of Lithuania, and threatening small countries in Eastern Europe, launched a conspiracy to annex Albania to threaten Britain, and when British-Soviet relations were improving, with recent plans to send the Chief of the General Staff to the Soviet Union, and while attempting to form an anti-aggression alliance and intensifying the training of mechanized troops, and consulting with France on practical joint defense, the German and Italian aggressors naturally demand that their accomplices in the East ignite the Soviet-Japanese incident to contain Soviet active measures in Europe. The dissemination of the above news about Germany supplying China with military supplies and credit is proof of this fact. Japan cannot abandon its two accomplices, Germany and Italy, so it must make some gesture. Although Japanese elders, senior officials, and moderates strongly oppose the conclusion of a military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Japanese military and fascist parties still want to maintain close relations between the three countries and increase more active cooperation.

In this Soviet-puppet border conflict, another more important fact can be seen, which is the intensification of internal contradictions within Japan. Although elders, senior officials, the financial world, and even some moderate military officers advocate détente with the Soviet Union, junior military officers believe that it is necessary to expand incidents in order to swindle military spending and suppress anti-war arguments and must constantly launch challenges against the Soviet Union. The early conclusion of the last Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement dispute was, according to reports, entirely due to the strong advocacy of elders, senior officials, and even some military officers and powerful figures in the financial world. Junior military officers were very dissatisfied, and some even advocated immediately waging war against the Soviet Union. Among the junior officers, the most hard-line and disobedient to government orders are the troops stationed abroad, especially the army. Therefore, before the government had even completed a week since signing the new Soviet-Japanese agreement, the Soviet-puppet border dispute arose again. At the same time, one can also see the secret struggle between the army and the navy. Recently, the navy's activities have been relatively active, and the army is sincerely afraid that military leadership will fall into other hands, or even be seized by the navy. Therefore, it has never been willing to relax its active and expansionist actions.

The new Soviet-Japanese dispute is just beginning. Yesterday's serious conflict has not yet stopped, and further developments deserve attention. However, this issue is not just a Soviet-puppet issue, nor is it just an issue between the Soviet Union and Japan. From the above analysis, it can be seen that it is indeed an international issue that transcends the Far East. Therefore, not only should China pay close attention, but Britain, the United States, France, and especially Eastern European countries, should give it deep consideration and make active preparations.

### Maintaining and Promoting the Fine Traditions of the New Fourth Army

— General Xiang Ying Speaks, Recorded by He Wei

Note: I had the opportunity to meet General Xiang Ying, Deputy Commander of the New Fourth Army, and he gave me a very systematic talk. I have recorded this valuable talk, but it has not been reviewed by General Xiang Ying himself. I am responsible for any improprieties or errors. The following is a record of his remarks: Reporter's note

The War of Resistance Against Japan is currently being fought. This war is related to the liberation of the people and determines the survival of the nation. The current aggressors are equipped with modern equipment. To defeat these brutal aggressors, we must mobilize all forces, unite all forces, and especially need an exceptionally outstanding army with the strongest fighting power to win the final victory in the protracted war and enable the Chinese nation to achieve true liberation.

Japan relies on the economic foundation of imperialism and has repeatedly gained military advantages in the war of aggression, attempting to use this advantage to destroy China. However, Japan is the weakest of the imperialist countries. Regardless of political or economic conditions, it cannot support a long war and cannot maintain its advantage over us in the long term. This is a fundamental factor that determines Japan's inevitable defeat in the protracted war.

At the same time, historically, no revolutionary army can obtain excellent equipment at the beginning, forming a disadvantage against the advantage, and gradually turn from disadvantage to advantage, and finally annihilate the enemy. This is mainly due to the revolutionary army's reliance on correct leadership and the broad masses of the people, the highest degree of revolutionary enthusiasm, strong will, and a spirit of loyalty and sacrifice to create the strongest fighting power. They can overcome all difficulties, gradually strengthen themselves, and achieve final victory. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan is a revolutionary war, and we are a revolutionary army, we can inherit and develop all the traditions of revolutionary armies, and we can not only carry out a protracted war, but also win the final victory in the protracted war. This is a fundamental reason why we can ultimately defeat Japan.

At present, the War of Resistance is transitioning to the second stage, which is when we prepare our forces for counterattack from the conditions of politics, military affairs, and economics. First of all, politics is more important than military affairs, the masses are more important than the army, and spirit is more important than material. The success of this preparation is the fundamental condition for determining the final victory. However, the ultimate purpose of preparation is to establish the strongest and most combat-capable excellent army to directly annihilate the aggressors and drive them out of China! Therefore, the fighting power of a strong army and the establishment and support of new armies have become the most central point in preparing for a counterattack and winning the final victory.

Our New Fourth Army was born and grew in the long-term national revolutionary struggle. It not only has a heroic history of fighting for national liberation in the past, but also created and inherited many fine traditions of the revolutionary army. We rely on these fine traditions to form the army's amazing fighting power to overcome any difficulties and become an invincible army. Now, in the War of Resistance to directly strive for national liberation, our New Fourth Army should contribute all its strength and unleash all its power to fight firmly to fulfill its due mission in the War of Resistance.

In terms of equipment, our New Fourth Army is not only far inferior to Japan, but also to the general friendly troops in the War of Resistance. However, since participating in the War of Resistance in Jiangnan, we have been able to contribute to the War of Resistance and achieve initial victories, mainly relying on the revolutionary fine traditions created and inherited in the long-term struggle to form the special fighting power of our army. Coupled with long-term combat experience and flexible use of tactics, we can use the most inferior weapons to fight against the superior Japanese and achieve victory.

All the fine traditions of our army are factors that constitute our army's fighting power. The foundation of strong fighting power enables our army to use the most inferior weapons to fight against the superior enemy and gradually turn from inferiority to superiority. This is one of the basic conditions for the revolutionary army to ultimately defeat the enemy.

What are the fine traditions of our army? In summary, they are our army's various new systems, new spirit of creation, and new fighting styles. Some are inherited from the traditions of revolutionary armies in history, but most were established by us in the hard struggle, and after countless experiences, they were formulated as new systems, creating new combat styles and cultivating a new work ethic. We must maintain and promote these.

Now, let us specifically explain the content of the fine traditions:

1. Equality, Friendship, and Unity Between Officers and Soldiers

All revolutionary armies, regardless of officers or soldiers, have the same political goals. They do not distinguish between noble and lowly based on official rank, nor do they differentiate based on the quality of life. However, due to differences in ability and responsibility, division of labor is implemented to carry out the unit's combat. Since everyone is a comrade, the troops can be united like one person, creating an invincible force.

Our New Fourth Army is not only a revolutionary army, but also one that was produced and grew up in the revolutionary struggle, and strengthened through long-term revolutionary warfare. Politically speaking, our New Fourth Army has consistently fought for the liberation of the Chinese nation and the liberation of society. It can also be said that it is the offspring of the Chinese revolutionary movement.

Precisely because of this, our New Fourth Army inherited the spirit of the revolutionary army and carried forward this spirit: "Equality, Friendship, and Unity Between Officers and Soldiers" is the concretization and actualization of this spirit.

Why do we need "equality between officers and soldiers"? Because the revolutionary army is composed of revolutionary elements. Those who join the army are not for salary or official position, but to fight for the cause of national liberation and social liberation! Therefore, officers and soldiers should practice "equality." It should not be interpreted as "averaging." Only by practicing "equality between officers and soldiers" can we unite the entire army to fight to the end.

Why do we need "friendship and unity"? Those who have the same political will are called comrades. Comrades should love each other so that they can be close and help each other. Unity is strength, and the more solid the unity, the stronger the strength. War is a comparison of strength. To defeat the enemy, we must be stronger than the enemy. To be strong, we must be united. All the commanders, fighters, and staff members of our New Fourth Army should practice friendship and unity. Only in this way can the entire army be united, share weal and woe, and create a general fighting force.

How do we practice "equality, friendship, and unity between officers and soldiers"? (A) All members of the unit are revolutionary comrades. There is only a division of labor, no distinction between noble and lowly. No one is allowed to insult anyone, despise anyone, or oppress anyone. There are no strict boundaries between them. (B) Officers and soldiers have the same life and treatment, such as the same amount of food allowance and the same food. No private kitchens or special good food are allowed. The clothing is the same. Officers and soldiers share weal and woe. Everyone should have a good time together, and everyone should endure hardships together. Leaders should set an example and be a model for soldiers. (C) Officers and soldiers have no salary, only pocket money. Sometimes, due to financial difficulties, there is only food allowance, no pocket money. Officers and soldiers are the same. Officers and soldiers cannot have excessive special enjoyment alone. (D) Officers and soldiers, comrades and comrades, should respect each other, be sincere and kind in attitude, and speak frankly and kindly. Salutes are mutual respect. No superiors are allowed to deceive subordinates, and no subordinates are allowed to bully superiors, let alone insult or oppress them. (E) Officers and soldiers and comrades should respect, love, and be friendly to each other, support each other in illness, help each other in distress, help each other in difficulty, exchange experiences, and advise each other on mistakes. No one is allowed to despise or confront each other. (F) Superiors should care for subordinates, and put soldiers first and themselves second. Subordinates should respect and obey superiors. Veteran fighters should help new fighters.

2. Political Work System

War is a continuation of politics and the highest form of political struggle. War itself is political struggle.

The army is an armed group for political struggle and the most powerful and necessary tool for conducting and implementing political propositions. The entire army should have political leadership because political work is the work of ensuring the spirit of the revolutionary army, thoroughly executing political tasks, and completing political tasks. It is to ensure this army ideologically, in life, and in action, just like the blood of the human body. Without blood and blood nutrition, people will die. Therefore, political work is the lifeline of the revolutionary army. Without it, it cannot grow and strengthen, and it cannot survive.

3. Integrating with the Masses

The army is the armed force of the people, produced and grown from the struggle of the people and with the people. It is like a family with the people, sharing the same interests and concerns.

An army must not only unite and love the people, but also represent and protect the people. If a fish loses water, it will not only be defeated but also easily be destroyed. In other words, if the army has the protection of the people, it can survive and will surely win. If it loses the people, it will fail and be destroyed.

Our New Fourth Army has consistently fought for the interests of the people in the past and present, and always takes the interests of the people as its own. It helps and unites the people everywhere, so it gains the faith and support of the people everywhere, so it can effectively overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy with the help of the people at all times.

How to integrate with the masses?

1. Loving the people has become one of the three main disciplines of our army!

2. Nine of the ten points for attention are our army's disciplines for the people. Everyone must do it and every item must be executed: (1) Return doors and straw, (2) Sweep houses clean, (3) Speak politely, (4) Be fair in transactions, (5) Return borrowed items, (6) Compensate for damages, (7) Use the toilet, (8) Do not molest women, (9) Report when entering and exiting, (10) Treat prisoners of war well.

We must mix with the people.

4. Hard Struggle and Perseverance to the End

The Chinese army is fighting to achieve the goal of national freedom and independence. It will not stop fighting until the goal is achieved. Only through struggle, resolute struggle to the end, can we achieve the final goal. Even if we suffer setbacks, the next person must still persevere in the struggle. Compromise means wavering in the revolution, and surrendering to the enemy is a traitor to the revolution and a shameful sinner.

Our new army fears no difficulty. As long as we can defeat the enemy, we will endure any hardship. Enduring hardship is our tempered traditional spirit. Being able to endure hardship and work hard is our skill.

We have gone through countless difficulties and suffered countless hardships, and we are fighting for the cause of national and social liberation, unyielding until death. We would rather die heroically than prolong our lives in humiliation. This is our fighting spirit.

5. Self-Sacrifice and Heroic Struggle

Revolution requires sacrifice to fight, and war requires sacrifice to win. Sacrificing oneself can save the nation and liberate the people. Those who cannot sacrifice cannot be called soldiers. Heroic sacrifice is the true color of soldiers and the glorious cause of soldiers.

Our New Fourth Army has made the most heroic sacrifices for resisting the enemy and saving the country and liberating the people in the past, and is still sacrificing and fighting now!

6. Consciously Observing Discipline

An army without discipline will disintegrate and perish. Discipline is the element that guarantees the army's consistent actions, maintains the army's living rules, consolidates relations between the army and the people, and strengthens the army's fighting power. Whose army has good discipline, whose fighting power is strong, and who is sure to defeat the enemy. The quality of discipline is the standard of the quality of the army, so the army must have strict discipline, and everyone must strictly observe discipline.

The army's victory over the enemy mainly depends not on the superiority of weapons, but on the army's heroic sacrifice, bravery, good fighting, unity of the people, unity of top and bottom, and especially strict discipline.

"What is meant by consciously observing discipline?"

Most ordinary armies use coercive methods to require people to observe and maintain discipline. If the coercive force is not strong, discipline will also be relaxed. Because the people who observe discipline are not voluntary and automatic, but forced, so they often find situations where they pretend to obey and deceive superiors. This kind of discipline cannot be consolidated, let alone maintained for a long time.

So-called "consciously observing discipline" means that everyone understands the importance of discipline and automatically observes it. Do not be forced to observe discipline under coercive methods, or only observe discipline when there is supervision, but automatically observe it anytime and anywhere, so that observing discipline becomes a natural action, and violating discipline is regarded as one's own sin.

7. Absolutely Abolish Corporal Punishment and the System of Beating and Scolding

Corporal punishment is a cruel method used by feudal rulers to deal with the oppressed, and masters to deal with slaves. Slightly civilized societies and enlightened armies do not use this feudal criminal law to manage society and the army. Only the armies of feudal warlords, or armies that retain heavy feudal remnants, use corporal punishment (such as beating with military sticks and slapping) to manage soldiers. This kind of criminal law is equivalent to treating soldiers as slaves. Revolutionary armies absolutely do not allow the existence of this kind of criminal law.

Since its establishment, our New Fourth Army has thoroughly eliminated corporal punishment and absolutely prohibits beating and scolding people. Anyone who uses corporal punishment will not only be severely punished by discipline, but also be opposed and attacked by all commanders and fighters. Anyone who beats or scolds people will be punished and reprimanded. Regardless of whether it is a leader to a subordinate or soldier to a soldier, or the army to the people, if they violate this discipline, they will be sanctioned.

8. Study Politics to Arm Your Mind, Continuously Improve Military Technology, and Strengthen Combat Power

Military technology develops with the development of social and economic conditions and the rapid progress of war. The revolutionary army is the most progressive army, seeking progress in everything and surpassing others in everything. Revolutionary soldiers should constantly study military affairs and improve military technology to increase their combat power. At the same time, they should not only be able to use their own weapons, but also strive to learn how to use the enemy's weapons in order to seize the enemy's weapons and eliminate the enemy.

The basic principle of war is to preserve oneself and eliminate the enemy. How to prevent oneself from being eliminated by the enemy and not perishing together with the enemy depends on one's own skillful tactics and combat methods. Therefore, it is even more necessary for revolutionary soldiers to continuously study military affairs and improve military technology.

Every officer and soldier of our New Fourth Army should understand and study politics. Political life is the center of life. Understanding and solving problems from a political perspective is our characteristic.

Our army has never undergone any formal military training or education, but is fighting. Our commanders have never attended a complete military school, and most of them are promoted from soldiers or transformed from civilians into military personnel, but they are able to fight and achieve many amazing victories.

Taking advantage of all possible opportunities to learn is what enables us to constantly move forward and become the most progressive army.

9. Agile Movements, Cautious Actions, Fierce Attacks, Tense and Lively

Our combat style is: (1) Agile movements. Cultivate agile movements in daily life in order to achieve agile movements in combat. Learn agile movements, develop agile actions, and promote agile movements. (2) Cautious actions. Combat is not only a contest of strength, but also a contest of intelligence. Whoever can fight skillfully will be able to defeat the enemy and achieve victory. Whoever can flexibly utilize changes in the battlefield situation will gain a favorable position and can reduce losses and achieve greater victories. (3) Fierce attacks. Our New Fourth Army not only has a strong attacking spirit, but also attacks very fiercely. Only by attacking fiercely can we shock the enemy's spirit, shake the enemy's will, and achieve a bayonet solution to the enemy and achieve final victory. Our slogans are: Fierce attack! Fierce charge! Fierce advance! (4) Tense and lively. The life and work of our New Fourth Army are carried out in the most tense conditions. Tension is the spirit of combat. All loose and lazy phenomena hinder the progress of work, affect the conduct of combat, and hinder the pursuit of victory. Vivacity can develop people's autonomy and creativity. When this spirit develops into combat, it becomes mobility. But vivacity is not licentiousness, but a sign of vitality. It is not rigid or mechanical, let alone reckless, but an organized, orderly, and natural dynamic.

10. Seize the Enemy's Arms to Arm Ourselves

The weapons of our army are all seized from the battlefield because we have no existing ordnance factories to manufacture weapons, nor can we purchase them in large quantities. Only by seizing the enemy's weapons to arm ourselves is our traditional skill. Therefore, in order to seize weapons, we must learn to fight, learn to snatch the enemy's guns and cannons in battle to enrich our equipment, strengthen our firepower, in order to seize the enemy's new weapons on a larger scale and build ourselves into a modernized army.

Our weapons are all obtained at the cost of blood, so we must protect our weapons and treat weapons as if they were our own lives.

Our slogans are:

(1) Seize the enemy's arms to arm ourselves!

(2) Use combat to snatch the enemy's guns!

(3) Cherish weapons as if they were our own lives!

(4) Weapons and life coexist and die together!

I call on all commanders and fighters of the army to maintain these fine traditions, develop these fine traditions, and fight so that the New Fourth Army can become a new model army and resist the war to the end to complete the task of final victory.

All acts that violate these fine traditions should be attacked by the entire army. All corrupt phenomena and actions are not allowed to exist in our army, and all corrupt elements will be naturally eliminated!

I solemnly call on all the commanders and fighters of our army to fight to maintain and promote the inherent fine traditions of our army, and to strive to inherit and accept all revolutionary traditions and progressive spirits. Only in this way can our army become stronger and stronger, creating the strongest army in the War of Resistance, uniting the largest number of people, and working together with friendly troops to persist in the long-term War of Resistance in Jiangnan, preparing for resistance, and finally driving the Japanese invaders out of China.

Let our national flag, like a relay flag, be hoisted again from Wuhu, Nanjing, to Shanghai!

### Our Army in Hubei and Henan Launches a Major Counteroffensive, Besieging Xinyang and Approaching the Suburbs, the County Seat of Zhongxiang Will Likely Fall Soon.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, Special Dispatch from Japan] Fan City Report: Our siege of Xinyang has pressed close to the suburbs. Zhongxiang is surrounded by us and will likely fall soon. × burned over a hundred of our civilian houses in Pengjiatan, killing hundreds of civilians.

[Central News Agency, Xuan City, 4th Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon, hundreds of our brave troops, under the cover of artillery fire, crossed the north bank of the Xiang River from Hongmiao, attacking ×. They immediately occupied Sanhechang. Our troops are still confronting × there. It is reported that our river-crossing troops killed many × at Lower Dawangmiao, also killing one × commander, and seizing many weapons and documents. After our attack, the entire × line was shaken. The × artillery on each side of the Bo River fired at our positions, about ten rounds. We suffered no losses. For several days, × has been transporting military supplies to the rear from Duobao, seemingly with a retreat in sight. (2) The × on the opposite bank of Shayang, fearing an attack by us, is organizing the local populace, issuing them weapons, and forcing them to defend along the river. Because our civilians resisted, they were shot and killed by × in large numbers.

[Central News Agency, Yichang, 4th Dispatch] Last night, our troops again crossed the river from Shayang to launch an attack, engaging in a fierce battle with × in the Duoshiwan area. Our soldiers bravely advanced, annihilating over two hundred ×, and seizing many spoils of war.

[Central News Agency, Xiushui, 4th Dispatch] The × advancing on Gao'an along the South Wan Highway engaged in a bloody battle with us in Gao'an on the 3rd, suffering heavy casualties. Later, × launched a second assault from the mountains of Wanshougong, and was invaded into the city walls. Our army was ordered to retreat to the south bank of the He River and the western suburbs of Gao'an to intercept.

[Central News Agency, Zhangshu, 3rd Dispatch] On the Gao'an front, after our army launched a major counteroffensive towards Xiangfu Temple on the evening of the 3rd, a mixed battle situation formed in the suburbs of Gao'an City by night. Fighting continued late into the night. × and our side both suffered heavy casualties.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th Dispatch] After × occupied Jiangmen, they arbitrarily shot and killed people. There is not a single complete house left in the city. Wherever × went, the neighborhoods were turned into ruins. After our army withdrew from Xinhui and the city, they continued to resist in the nearby suburbs. For the × in Shaping, we have dispatched additional troops to besiege.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 5th Dispatch] Our army's counterattack on Shaping on the 3rd was very successful. × bombarded us with fierce artillery fire. Our army advanced fiercely through the rain of bullets. ×'s forces were unable to withstand it and fled in disarray towards the Huangbaokeng Gubu area. Our army immediately recovered Shaping, seizing many × helmets and military supplies. Our army is currently in pursuit.

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 5th Dispatch] On the afternoon of the 3rd, over a thousand × troops, with their sharp weapons, invaded from Zengcheng in two routes: one from Lizhihui Pingfengling, and one from Hululong'ao Zhenghuluding. Our army divided up and bravely welcomed them, and the battle situation was very fierce. Both sides suffered considerable casualties. The fierce battle continued until night, and × and we are still in a stalemate.

[Central News Agency, Jinhua, 5th Dispatch] The county seat of Wukang is still tightly surrounded by our army. On the afternoon of the 2nd, our army captured Shangbaiju, the outer perimeter of Wukang, killing over a hundred ×, and capturing a × soldier named Kobayashi.

### Our Air Force Flies to Nanchang to Bomb Japanese Ammunition Depot in Retaliation for the Japanese Attack on Changsha

[Associated Press, Shanghai, 5th] According to Chinese reports, six Japanese planes bombed Changsha yesterday, destroying twenty houses and killing forty civilians.

When the Chinese planes carried out the bombing, Japanese anti-aircraft fire was very fierce, but they were able to safely return to their base.

Another American Church Bombed

[Reuters, Shanghai, 5th] Two Japanese planes bombed Changsha yesterday. One bomb fell on the American church in the area. Only minimal damage was sustained, and there were no deaths or injuries. Another two bombs fell within twenty yards of the walls, and four bombs fell within a hundred yards of the walls. Although the American church did not fly an American flag when the Japanese planes bombed, the building was easily distinguishable. There is no reason why the Japanese planes would have dropped the bombs by mistake. In addition, four bombs fell outside the North Gate, killing twenty Chinese and injuring one hundred and twenty. According to unofficial sources, there have been fifteen incidents of American property being bombed since March 1st.

American Embassy Lodges Protest

[Reuters, Beiping, 4th] The American Embassy here has again lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities regarding the Japanese bombing of American property in China.

### The Puppet Reserve Bank is on the Verge of Bankruptcy, Puppet Currency Cannot Circulate, Reserves are Extremely Empty

[Hong Kong News] Regarding the × puppet plot to undermine our national currency and disrupt our financial market by the puppet United Reserve Bank in Beiping issuing puppet currency and stopping the restriction on the circulation of legal tender. Chongqing financial experts yesterday (the 4th) expressed talks, pointing out that the puppet currency is bound to fail, and our legal tender has a way to circulate permanently. The meaning is insightful, the exposition is clear, and especially makes the general public's confidence in the legal tender solid and deeply understood. It is learned from the banking community that the contents of the puppet United Reserve Bank are as follows: The puppet United Reserve Bank, since its establishment on March 10th of the 27th year of the Republic of China, although its issuance of paper currency has reached an amount of 210 million yuan, only 90 million yuan is circulating in the market. Its reserves, in addition to 400,000 US dollars and 700,000 yuan in notes from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, have all been taken away by the × military. The contents of the bank are extremely empty. Although it has various restrictions on legal tender, it actually needs a premium of 80/1000. The Tianjin-Shanghai exchange rate is also 30/1000. Its control of foreign exchange for exports has also failed to achieve its expected results, resulting in the prices of goods and stocks in various northern ports rising uniformly due to the fall of the puppet currency. The following is listed for review: (1) The amount of United Reserve Bank notes issued is 210 million yuan, with approximately 90 million yuan circulating. (2) Reserves for the notes include 400,000 US dollars and 700,000 yuan in notes from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. (3) The premium for exchanging puppet currency for legal tender is 80/1000. (4) The Tianjin exchange rate has risen by 30/1000. (5) The control of foreign exchange for exports has failed to achieve the expected results. (6) Prices of goods and stocks are all trending upwards. (Central News Agency)

### Questions and Protests Arise in Parliament, Japanese Politics are Dark, Government Officials Transform Into Company Directors and Board Members

[Reuters, Tokyo, 5th Dispatch] Recent meetings of the Japanese Parliament have severely criticized the improper practice of government officials holding positions as directors or board members in most companies invested in by the government. For example, the Vice Minister of Communications has accepted the position of Deputy Manager of the newly organized Japan Electric Power Company. The fact that some government officials immediately take up important positions in large companies after resigning is an undesirable old custom in Japan that has aroused dissatisfaction. The "Chugai Business News" stated, "There is no doubt that government officials filling important positions in large companies often lead to undesirable results. When political parties began to oppose this move, the government replied that this is necessary for carrying out supervision. We cannot understand this attitude. The government can promulgate regulations to implement its protection and supervision responsibilities. It is not necessary for officials to serve as directors or board members of large companies."

### National Government Order

### Soviet Red Army Newspaper Points Out the End of the Japanese Army, Local Advances Cannot Reverse the Decline, So-called Success Will Soon Turn Into Nothing

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 4th Dispatch] Moscow News: The Red Star Newspaper made a special comment on the current war situation in China, saying that although the Japanese army's occupation of the area near the Han River and Nanchang has local significance, it cannot affect the real military progress. The Japanese plan is to carry out economic exploitation in the occupied areas on the one hand, and to actively carry out military operations on the other, but both are extremely unstable. The newspaper continued, saying that the constantly developing guerrillas are extremely active, and a new batch of civilians joins every day, posing an extremely serious threat to the Japanese plan. The Japanese attempt to break the Chinese army's firm determination has failed, because the Chinese army has always maintained its high morale and combat quality. The newspaper pointed out that it is not uncommon for Japanese soldiers to be executed for resisting orders from their superiors, proving that the ranks of the invaders are extremely chaotic. The Japanese army has also suffered repeated defeats in its encounters with the guerrillas, which has further demoralized the Japanese army. At present, the entire occupied area requires more Japanese troops and financial resources to be consumed every day, and all the successes that the Japanese army has achieved have turned into nothing.

### ### Qi Pizhang Discusses Post-War Japan: Rural Areas Already Deeply Feeling the Lack of Young Men; Prison Cannot Suppress the Voices Against War

(Newsletter from the Revolutionary Society of China) "Japanese ××ism? It's coming soon! Collapse is not far off!" The setting sun outside reflected the afterglow of the setting sun, a young, New China Youth Army-style Mongolian youth, Mr. Qi Pizhang, said to the reporter.

In 1935, when Prince De was nominally still the Secretary-General of the Mongolian government and had not openly embraced the × people, he sent several Mongolian youths to study in Japan in order to train his henchmen. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China launched its sacred all-out war of resistance. These Mongolian youths keenly saw the economic difficulties within the country of the × people, the very high anti-war sentiment of the people, the heavy casualties of the × soldiers, and other phenomena. Their unwillingness to be slaves and their longing for the bright future of their motherland led them to leave the shackles of the × people under the pretext of leaving. They tried to return to the embrace of their motherland. Mr. Qi was one of them. He is a promising Mongolian youth who has the greatest confidence in the victory of the war of resistance.

"I returned to China in the late autumn of last year, when the war of resistance had been going on for fifteen months. The × people are becoming more and more bitter in the war, and they don't know where their mud feet will sink. The people's anti-war sentiment is growing with the war; workers are striking, and intellectuals are also cursing the war. It's coming soon, these will erupt sooner or later, and together with China's counter-offensive, it will be the time of the total collapse of Japanese ××ists." He emphasized this point.

"The total number of deaths of Japanese soldiers is more than five or six hundred thousand. The rural areas of Japan have already deeply felt the lack of young men. Last year, I was in a village near a village in Tokyo to escape the summer heat. During the Russo-Japanese War, that village only conscripted eight soldiers, but during the month I was escaping the summer heat, more than forty young men were conscripted. Just like that for a month, and I don't know how many more will be conscripted in the future. Compared with the people's sentiments during the Russo-Japanese War, it is very different, no, it is simply the opposite. I no longer see the enthusiastic emotions of fathers sending off their sons and wives sending off their husbands to the battlefield during the Russo-Japanese War. All there is is the silent tears of the departing family members.

"How about prices? Prices are soaring like crazy. A box of Japanese cigarettes used to cost only one copper coin, but now it costs more than twenty cents. Eating a meal is three or four times more expensive than before. The lively places like Ginza, the new wild chicken cars are almost extinct. There are also fewer buses running. In the past, university students and middle school students were not allowed to wear "geta" in the classroom. Now, they are encouraged to wear "geta". On the streets, you see students staggering drunk. Indecent wild chickens, decorated with international girls' "thousand-stitch belts" and donation. "Mud stick one (thief)" is increasing, how can people not rob people if they have nothing to eat?"

"What Japan lacks most are cotton, leather, hardware, coal, iron, and oil, especially oil and iron. Japan will soon run out of oil. Most of the factories in Osaka have closed. Only military factories are left, and even military factories will soon have no raw materials to supply. There are more unemployed workers than ever before. Strikes, strikes! Although Japan's strict police network has the ability to prevent people from openly opposing the war, he has no way to deal with strikes."

"Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Japan has become a prison for the people. Thousands and thousands of students, professors, scholars, and commentators have been arrested. Hitoshi Yamakawa and Yoneo Kuroda were also imprisoned. Only Takao Murofushi, who wrote "Respectful Announcement to the Chinese People" with Hu Shi, has not been arrested, and he often writes articles cursing the war, saying that Japan is an aggressor and that both China and Japan are "mutually harmed". Japanese elders and important officials, like the Japanese people, are all worried about when this war will end and the 'future' of Japan.

"Of course, there are proud Japanese people, too. The zaibatsu, the military cliques, young officers, officials, and civil servants, are flaunting their power and thinking of conquering China with all their might, regardless of the hatred and curses of the people of their own country, digging their own graves in China day by day."

"In diplomacy, Japan has only two friends who are in a state of mutual embarrassment, Italy and Germany. It propagates that: this fight is not with China, but with the United States and the Soviet Union, economically fighting Britain, and ideologically fighting the Soviet Union."

"Did you see Prince De when you came back to China?" The reporter, seeing that he had talked a lot about the situation in Japan, turned his tone and asked him.

"I saw him, because I escaped after returning to Suiyuan." He said frankly, Prince De is very depressed, and also very painful. The first time I saw him, he still looked happy, thinking that the students he had planted had returned. After each conversation, he showed the sadness of being a puppet. He himself wanted to use Japan, but unexpectedly Japan used him. The people under him are gone. His are gone, and became the old Han traitors of Rehe seven or eight years ago. His own actions are also being monitored by the Japanese. Prince De is a bit "regretful". I believe that Prince De will also return to the embrace of the motherland one day.

"Mr. Qi's actions" and "how is your work?" the reporter asked.

"I am preparing to go to Chongqing to pay my respects to the leader. Whatever work is assigned to me, I will do it. As long as it is work related to the war of resistance, I can do it," he said generously.

Leaving Mr. Qi, the twilight had enveloped the fields. Looking at the wisps of smoke from the chimneys, I couldn't help but happily think, you poor Han traitor puppet, the "talents" you cultivated are all standing on the front line to fight for the motherland, just like every Chinese national.

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, April 4] While Polish Foreign Minister Beck is conducting negotiations with the British government in London, Paris is also fulfilling its part of the responsibility by closely planning to unite the anti-aggression pact. According to news reported by "Le Progrès" this morning, Foreign Minister Bonnet met with Soviet Ambassador Surits, British Ambassador Phipps, and Turkish Minister Menemencioğlu yesterday for this purpose. The newspaper also stated that Bonnet told the ambassadors of the three countries that France not only attaches importance to the participation of Poland and Romania in the anti-aggression group, but is especially eager for the Soviet Union to join the alliance.

In response to inquiries as to whether British Chief of the General Staff Gort might visit Warsaw and Moscow in the future, Hore-Belisha replied that he was currently unable to report anything. When asked whether the government thought it should open negotiations with new countries joining the alliance, the Secretary of State for War replied that the government had considered this matter in detail.

[Central News Agency, Berlin, April 4] The German Foreign Ministry today issued an informal statement in response to the British Prime Minister's speech yesterday. The statement warned Britain that Germany would never remain silent and tolerate Britain's "aggressive" tendencies towards Germany. Britain's aim is to incite a war between the two groups of countries in Europe, while Britain itself is far from the front lines. The German side therefore expressed great indignation towards Britain for the British Prime Minister's recent statement that Britain, Poland, and other countries would form an "anti-Hitler alliance".

### Both Italy and Germany Actively Prepare for War, Britain Issues Warning to Italy: Any Harm to Albania's Integrity Will Violate the Anglo-Italian Agreement

[Associated Press, Rome, 4th] Reports from informed circles here indicate that Germany and Italy are showing clear signs of actively preparing for war in response to the encirclement by democratic nations. Italy is engaging in covert activities across its army, navy, and air force. The general headquarters of various forces have been moved from Rome to Trento, near the borders with France and Yugoslavia. Simultaneously, German heavy artillery is being transported into Italy. Reliable sources say that despite Italian government denials of any intended action against Albania, significant military forces are indeed concentrating in Berlin. Unverified reports claim that detachments of Italian air force personnel have already landed in Albania. The Albanian government has issued a statement denying any Italian military activity within its borders.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 4th] Diplomatic circles here have received reports from Italy and the Albanian capital stating that Italy is preparing to take military action against Albania. Semi-official denials issued by certain quarters are likely unreliable. In a speech on the 26th of last month, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini stated that Italy considers the Mediterranean Sea a vital space for its survival, including the Adriatic Sea. He later declared on the 30th of last month that Italy does not wish to be confined to the Mediterranean. All of this carries significant weight. Italy has already dispatched numerous advisors to assist Albania and has made substantial investments there, effectively maintaining a monopoly. The intention now is to strengthen this position to prevent Albania from being swayed by other powers. Furthermore, the unresolved Croat issue in Yugoslavia and the potential for German intrigues, particularly the possibility of Germany establishing a foothold in the Adriatic Sea, are matters of great concern to Italy. Therefore, Italy intends to send troops to Albania to pressure Yugoslavia, preventing it from being controlled by Germany and stopping it from joining the security plan advocated by Britain and forming an alliance with Poland, Romania, and Turkey.

[Reuters, Rome, 5th] Last night, the Popolo d'Italia claimed that "reports circulating about the situation between Italy and Albania are entirely baseless and deliberately fabricated." However, according to an Italian communiqué, Italy, at the overt request of the King of Albania, is engaging in negotiations to strengthen Italo-Albanian defense. These negotiations are ongoing, and Italy has no intention of violating Albania's independence or territorial integrity. Rome believes that the joint defense with Albania is aimed at countering British activities in Greece and Yugoslavia and the anti-aggression front movement. Italy's occupation of Albania could make these countries feel the necessity of maintaining friendly relations with Rome and Berlin, allowing Italy to secure the Adriatic Sea. Italy's occupation of Albania would undoubtedly increase Yugoslavia's unease. Following Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia, this matter is said to have stirred emotions in Yugoslavia, leading its people to support Britain's anti-aggression plan.

[Associated Press, Paris, 5th] Reports from Albania indicate that Italian troops may land in Albania within the next day or two. The report stated that the Albanian authorities have rejected Mussolini's demand for peaceful occupation, although it is rumored that King Zog himself originally intended not to resist.

[Associated Press, London, 4th] The British government has indirectly warned Italy that any action that jeopardizes Albania's integrity would violate the Anglo-Italian Agreement of 1938.

[Associated Press, London, 4th] It has been learned that the Albanian authorities have formally informed Britain that reports claiming King Zog of Albania requested to place Albania under Italian protection are untrue. The Albanian authorities have expressed disapproval of Italy's actions to expand its influence in Albania.

[Associated Press, Rome, 5th] Reports received by political circles here state that King Zog of Albania, recognizing new problems arising from the European situation, has requested Italy to expand its military capabilities to respond to them. Mussolini's response is said to include repealing Article One of the Anglo-Italian Agreement to allow the dispatch of army, navy, and air force units to Albania.

[Associated Press, Rome, 5th] Local commentators analyze Italy's activities in Albania, defining its meaning and purpose as: (1) A demonstration by the Axis powers as retribution for the encirclement of Germany; (2) Strengthening the authority of the 1927 Italo-Albanian Treaty; (3) Increasing German influence in the Adriatic Sea, aimed at Poland; (4) Warning Greece and Yugoslavia not to participate in unfriendly actions within the anti-German bloc; (5) Ousting Greek and Yugoslav economic influence and labor from Albania; (6) Securing the Adriatic Sea by establishing a naval base in Albania; (7) Enhancing the Italian military's reputation abroad; (8) Demonstrating to the world that the Adriatic Sea is within Italy's sphere of influence.

[Central News Agency, Rome, 4th] While rumors circulate that Italy is about to dispatch troops to Albania, responsible officials here are making no comment. The Albanian ambassador, recently appointed, has already flown back to his home country with embassy staff. Furthermore, what transpired during British Ambassador Sir Percy Loraine's meeting with Foreign Minister Ciano on the morning of the 4th remains confidential to both British and Italian figures. It is believed that this is related to the talk of Italy dispatching troops to Albania.

### Iraqi Mob Kills British Consul, Burns British Consulate, Iraqi Prime Minister Apologizes

[Reuters, Baghdad, 4th] British Consul Mr. Monck-Mason in Mosul was shot and killed today by a mob during a demonstration prompted by the sudden accidental death of Iraqi King Ghazi in a car accident. The British consulate was set on fire. Martial law was declared throughout the city, and order was only restored after several hours. Officials in London stated that the incident occurred because agitators incited mourners near the British consulate, alleging that the King's death was orchestrated by the British. Four suspects have been arrested and will be tried by a special court. The Iraqi Prime Minister visited the British diplomatic mission in Baghdad this afternoon to express his apologies, stating that he was shocked by the incident.

### US Aircraft Carrier Hornet Launched Day Before Yesterday, House Foreign Affairs Committee Forms Subcommittee to Study Neutrality Law Amendments

[Central News Agency, Quincy, Massachusetts, USA, 4th] The new US aircraft carrier Hornet was launched here today. The ship cost $20 million and is the largest aircraft carrier built by the United States in nearly four years.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th] In accordance with President Roosevelt's arms expansion law, the US Army's aircraft fleet must increase to 6,000. Assistant Secretary of War Johnson recently told the press that his department will take the necessary measures to increase the number of aircraft by 3,000 before July 1, 1939. It has been decided to order 5,500 aircraft from various manufacturers in the short term, including heavy bombers and destroyers.

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] The House Foreign Affairs Committee has formed a subcommittee of seven members to study the amendments to the Neutrality Law.

### Iraqi Heir Ascends the Throne

[Haitong News Agency, Baghdad, 5th] Following the car accident that killed King Ghazi of Iraq on Sunday, the royal family announced yesterday that Crown Prince Faisal will succeed to the throne. The new king was born on May 2, 1935, is four years old, and is named Faisal II. Furthermore, the Iraqi Regent Cabinet has resolved that during the regency, administrative power will remain with the parliament. The cabinet also decreed a national mourning period of forty days. Condolences were received from various Arab countries yesterday, and both Syria and Transjordan lowered their flags to half-mast in mourning. The funeral of the former King Ghazi will be held today at the family mausoleum.

### Lebrun Expected to Be Elected in First Round of French Presidential Election

[Haitong News Agency, Paris, 5th] The French presidential election is being held today in Versailles. President Lebrun, whose term has expired, has submitted his resignation but has been compelled to run as a candidate.

[Central News Agency, Paris, 4th] Both houses of parliament are scheduled to hold a National Assembly in the Palace of Versailles on the 5th to elect the president. Current President Lebrun has agreed to participate in the election. Former Minister of Justice Caillaux has withdrawn his candidacy. Political figures believe that President Lebrun will be elected in the first round.

### Hitler's Menace Turns to Denmark, Instigating Ethnic Issues, Planning Aggressive Military Alliance

[London, 5th] According to well-informed sources, the current international situation is far from optimistic. Germany, considering Poland's resolute refusal to cede, has apparently abandoned plans to attack Danzig and is now focusing elsewhere. Nazi newspapers, with official authorization, are concentrating on the German minority issue in Denmark. The National Zeitung, linked to General Göring, voiced yesterday that Germans in Denmark are suffering from poor treatment, making daily life extremely difficult. Germans in Schleswig have faced hardship since separating from Germany in 1920, and their 'culture' is being forced to relinquish, a situation that is intolerable. Germany and Italy are still expressing anger over Chamberlain's second speech in the House of Commons. The Berliner Tageblatt correspondent noted that Nazi officials will not issue a response until Hitler returns to Berlin. Berlin views Chamberlain's and Halifax's actions as largely in line with Hitler's perception of the threats from Bucharest and Greece. Some believe that Hitler will transform the German-Italian-Japanese anti-Comintern pact into a military alliance. The leader of the Polish National Party declared in Warsaw yesterday, "If Germany advances an inch, war will break out. Poland will not only fight if directly threatened by Germany but will also resist any expansionist action by Germany in any sphere." This statement has caused considerable excitement in Poland. A Warsaw correspondent reports, "While Poland has not provided an official explanation, it undoubtedly refers to Danzig, Lithuania, Hungary, and Romania." After a prolonged period of silence, a semi-official Roman newspaper yesterday began attacking Britain, stating, "Britain's attempt to control Gibraltar and the Cyrenaica port, essentially making Italy a prisoner in the Mediterranean, is absolutely intolerable." Italian Minister of Education Bottai declared in Rome yesterday that the British anti-aggression front is targeting Germany, just as it is targeting Italy.

Brief Commentary

### Celebrating the Chinese Nation: Centenary Celebration for Old Mr. Ma Xiangbo

Today, all circles in Chongqing are enthusiastically celebrating "Old Mr. Ma Xiangbo's Centenary Celebration". We respectfully offer our congratulations here to Old Mr. Ma Xiangbo's centenary for the Chinese nation.

"It is rare to reach seventy years in life", and Old Mr. Ma Xiangbo is actually over a hundred years old, but we believe that Old Mr. Ma still has particularly admirable and celebratory qualities, especially the following: First, Old Mr. Ma, as a veteran pioneer of Chinese Catholics, has dedicated his life to education. He first donated his property to support university education, such as Fudan University and other schools, his achievements in cultivating talents and developing culture are truly a model for the whole country. Second, Old Mr. Ma, as a centenarian, is always close to young people, cares for young people, and is always worried about falling behind. Therefore, he is always able to uphold justice in all matters, and he is especially keen to promote all progressive thoughts and revolutionary theories, and he does not hesitate to attack all stubbornness, conservatism, and counter-revolutionary words and actions. This is especially worthy of loyal emulation by national and social leaders today. Third, Old Mr. Ma has worked hard for national affairs and has been particularly concerned in recent years. Since the September 18th Incident, he has repeatedly issued appeals to stop the civil war and unite against foreign enemies. Afterwards, the unfolding of the national salvation movement and the formation and consolidation of the anti-Japanese national united front owe a great debt to Mr. Ma. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he has resolutely done his best, without giving up or slacking off; at this critical stage of the War of Resistance and national construction, we should especially learn from Mr. Ma's spirit, strengthen unity, and persist in the War of Resistance. Fourth, Old Mr. Ma has always been loyal to his country. Since the War of Resistance, he has upheld his unwavering spirit, traveling under the guns of the enemy as a centenarian, traversing the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan, unwilling to steal a living under the influence of the enemy. He continues to do his best for the country and the nation; and he also speaks to Chinese and foreign reporters from time to time, using his old and sincere patriotism and experience to explain the current situation at home and abroad, explaining that our country's persistence in united resistance against Japan will surely win the final victory. He cutsly rebukes the shameful behavior of the enemy, and calls on the righteous people of the world to swear not to stand with them. He expresses unlimited optimism about the future of the nation. Finally, in addition to repeatedly calling for unity, Mr. Ma also strongly advocates the implementation of democratic politics as a guarantee of victory in the War of Resistance. Therefore, today, when we celebrate Old Mr. Ma's centenary, we are also celebrating the centenary of the leader of our national liberation movement. This is Old Mr. Ma's glory, and it is also the glory of the Chinese nation!

Our celebration of Old Mr. Ma's centenary cannot be merely a formal celebration. We must celebrate these five great spirits of Old Mr. Ma, and work together to promote them and make them successful. At the same time, we must also take the practical action of "wishing Old Mr. Ma long life and wishing our nation long life", and all circles in Chongqing have stipulated that the congratulatory gifts should be used to rescue wounded soldiers and help those who have suffered. We should step up and promote this glorious donation campaign! We celebrate for Old Mr. Ma remotely here, and we celebrate for the leader of the national revolution and its future!

Where is Wang Jingwei Going?

After Mr. Wang Jingwei published an article catering to the intentions of the Japanese aggressors, using the nation to engage in ..., it seemed to cause some reaction: one was the righteous denunciation of patriotic people, and the other was the praise of the Japanese and the flattery of the puppet traitors in the north and south.

Newspapers in this city that cherish the motherland and uphold justice unanimously denounced Wang's article. Although these newspapers are still being shamelessly slandered by traitors and their newspapers, they are supported by all those who love the motherland, love the government, and all those who uphold justice. Even those who are currently working for the enemy, if they still have a bit of humanity, cannot help but feel deeply ashamed (although they have long lost their humanity, we still retain some hope that they will recover their humanity!). As for the newspapers that publish Wang's articles and make excuses for them, their usual words and messages pollute my ink and paper, so I will not add any rebuttal. For example, regarding the murder of Yan Zhongming, that newspaper first used the attention-grabbing word "Chongqing". May I ask if their true intention is to insinuate the central government? Is it maliciously and intentionally causing readers to misunderstand, thinking that the central government would really do such a boring thing - so as to fall into their trick? Otherwise, what does "Chongqing" refer to? And why is the word "Chongqing" dragged in from nowhere? On the one hand, they deliberately spread rumors, and on the other hand! Fortunately, the readers also know your meaning and tricks! You

We must still pay attention to the enemy's attitude towards Wang. According to a Shanghai telegram from Haitong News Agency one day, the northern and southern puppet regimes are planning to organize a puppet central government, intending to make Wang the premier. However, a Tokyo telegram on the 4th stated that the Japanese told Wang: "Although we completely agree with his views, we can never be satisfied with the so-called peace conditions he previously proposed, and in the current situation, Hanoi in French Indochina is by no means a suitable place for Wang himself and his peace movement." Then, it is already suggesting! History is a ruthless witness, watching where Wang Jingwei is going!

### British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson Returns to London, Will Discuss with Burgin, Representatives from Finland and Sweden Arrive in England Soon

[Haitong News Agency, London, * Day] Overseas Trade Minister Hudson returned to the country by plane yesterday after visiting Warsaw, Moscow, the capital of Finland and the capital of Sweden. Hudson hastily ended his affairs in the capital and returned to the country because he wanted to discuss with Foreign Minister Burgin before he left England. Reporters interviewed Hudson at the airport, and according to him, when he went abroad, he met with the rulers of various countries. In short, various countries are extremely interested in Britain's military expansion. The industrial circles of Finland and Sweden will also send people to England to investigate during the day, so now is the time for Britain to develop trade with Northern Europe. According to what reporters have heard, the effects of Hudson's trip can be confirmed in 24 hours.

### Hong Kong Air Defense Bureau Cultivates a Large Number of Air Defense Talents, Actively Trains the Public in Air Defense, Sends Letters to Major Commercial Firms to Send Personnel to Participate in Air Defense Training, Lo Man Kam Discusses the Purpose of Holding Chinese Voluntary Registration

Since its establishment, the Hong Kong Air Defense Bureau has been extremely active in conducting air defense training for the public, and has organized air defense training classes in various districts to impart basic air defense knowledge to the public. A large number of people have graduated from the air defense knowledge class. Air Defense Commissioner Spurgean recently decided to hold an air defense class for commercial firm employees in late April. Yesterday, he sent letters to major commercial firms in Hong Kong, asking them to cooperate with the authorities and send one or two people to participate in the class so that after graduation, they can use what they have learned to teach their firms' employees, thereby promoting air defense propaganda. The Air Defense Bureau's letter to various commercial firms is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, this bureau has decided to hold an air defense class for commercial firm employees in late April, taught in Chinese and English, two lessons per week, and the teaching time is set to start at 5:00 pm. The courses are as follows: (A) Methods of guarding against attacks by shrapnel from bombs; (B) Methods of extinguishing incendiary bombs; (C) Gas defense; (D) Blackout regulations; (E) Design of air defense plans for shops. The purpose of the event is to cultivate air defense talents so that each commercial firm can have trained employees to be responsible for air defense design and air defense rescue team training. Please cooperate with us and send one or two employees to participate in the training, and please notify this bureau of the employees' names as soon as possible so that we can proceed, etc." In addition, the registration of British residents in Hong Kong started on April 10th, but only a hundred or so people have registered in the past few days. There are more than 6,000 British people in Hong Kong, but only this number has registered in the past few days, which shows that it is not enthusiastic. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is noted that the Chinese registration will be carried out during the day and will be handled by the Secretary for Chinese Affairs. Regarding this matter, the reporter specially visited Chinese representative Lo Man Kam yesterday to ask him about it. According to him, the registration of British residents is handled by the special department of the police authorities, while the Chinese registration is handled by the Secretary for Chinese Affairs. Although the responsible parties are different, the methods of carrying out the work are not consistent. For example, registrants must fill in their name, age, place and date of birth, address, telephone number, skills, and experience. Regarding the methods of carrying out the work, we have already submitted a complete plan to the government some time ago, but it is not known whether it will be adopted. When it is implemented, I believe that it will be nothing more than distributing formatted forms to various companies and firms for free filling in. The government's purpose in doing this is to hope to have a large number of talents serving in wartime. Enthusiastic people, regardless of whether they are British citizens or not, can register. As far as I know, the Secretary for Chinese Affairs has drafted a plan and it can be started today.

### Yesterday's Second Trial of the Tea Fragrance Room Blood Case, Witness Could Not Recognize the Face of the Murderer, Yeung Siu-kei Detailed the Circumstances of Capturing the Murderer on That Day

The case of Japanese man Yoshiro Aizome being slashed to death in the Tea Fragrance Room on Hennessy Road was brought before the Central Magistracy for a second hearing yesterday afternoon. First, a surveyor from the Public Works Department, Chung See, and a photographer from the police station testified in succession about taking pictures and making films of the scene of the incident. Then, Yeung Siu-kei, a customer who witnessed the incident, testified in detail about what he saw at the time and said that he did not know what the murderer looked like, he only speculated that he was a waiter because waiters often wear white clothes. At this point, the prosecutor asked Mr. Yeung, "Can you recognize whether the murderer is in court?" Yeung looked around and then replied, "He is not here." The prosecutor then ordered the defendant to stand up and pointed him out, but Yeung still said that he could not clearly recognize whether the defendant's face resembled the murderer.

When he was asked about the circumstances of the crime, he snatched the knife and said, "Don't slash, don't go, don't move." Then he heard the murderer say angrily, "You Chinese killed my family and raped my sister-in-law." At that time, I was still holding his hand tightly and the kitchen knife also fell to the ground. After finishing his testimony, he answered the questions asked by the defendant's lawyer, Li Ya. Following him was the testimony of Yu Kwok-leung, a female customer who was sitting with Yeung. However, a Westerner, Lu Shan, was sitting on Yu's right and a woman surnamed Chan was sitting on Yu's left. Before the incident, there was no movement or sound. When she heard the sound of someone being slashed, Yu initially thought it was someone chopping chicken. Then she saw someone being slashed in a booth. Yu said that she was so shocked that she could not describe it and did not dare to look again. Yu said "Oh no" and then Yeung Siu-kei went forward and hugged the murderer tightly. She immediately heard the murderer say, "You don't have to be afraid, I am getting revenge." He also said, "My uncle, younger brother, and sister-in-law have all been killed." Before the incident, there was no disturbance or special sound in the shop. When Chan Yuk-lan fainted, Yu called Yeung to save her. The judge then summoned Lu Shan-nu, a Westerner who was sitting with Yeung and Yu, to testify. Finally, Chan Yuk-lan testified. Because the judge said that other witnesses still needed to be summoned in this case, he ordered that the case be adjourned until this afternoon for another hearing.

### A Summary of Hong Kong Student Movements: The Past and Future of the Student Relief Society; The New Executive Committee Arranges Future Work for the First Time Yesterday

— Qi Zhuo

An Ordinary Miracle

Young people lack experience; older people lack enthusiasm. The most precious are young students. They possess a high degree of vigilance and passionate emotions. From the May Fourth Movement to the current stage of the national liberation struggle, young students have poured out their hearts, sweat, and blood to contribute to their motherland and their work, always standing on the most progressive and important ground.

Students organizing and demonstrating collective strength is a common occurrence in the mainland. However, it is an amazing miracle in Hong Kong! Many miracles are blossoming from the salutes of national liberation. The organization and roar of Hong Kong students are but a rapid stream in the surging tides of the era.

Looking back, it was on September 24th of the year before last that Hong Kong's young students, unwilling to be separated from their motherland and in accordance with the needs of the War of Resistance, convened a meeting of representatives from various schools, initiated by Hong Kong University students. The Hong Kong Student Relief Society was established on the spot, and Sir William Hornell, former Vice-Chancellor of Hong Kong University, was appointed as Chairman, with Bishop Hall and Luo Wenjin as advisors. Since then, a student group representing nearly a thousand primary, secondary, and tertiary schools in Hong Kong, with a total of over 100,000 students, was declared established amidst the sounds of the War of Resistance.

Past Work

Although the aggressors were very crazy, the cannons of our War of Resistance gave them a painful blow to the head. Although the environment in Hong Kong is special, the work of the Student Relief Society has been carried out in the face of difficulties. Reviewing the work that the Student Relief Society has done in the past nineteen months, the major items include:

First—Regarding fundraising: (1) In October of the 26th year of the Republic of China, a frugality and thrift relief campaign was held, raising over 4,000 yuan. (2) The New Year's Charity Fair in the 27th year raised over 2,000 yuan. (3) In February of the 27th year, a three-day fast was held by students throughout Hong Kong to purchase Sero clothes, raising over 5,000 yuan. (4) The Wan Chai section's exchange fair in March of the 27th year raised over 100 yuan. (5) The concert in April of the 27th year raised over 2,000 yuan. (6) The Causeway Bay section raised over 280 yuan in April of the 27th year. (7) In the same year, the "July 7th" memorial flag donation raised over 2,000 yuan. (8) In the same year, the "August 13th" donation campaign raised over 2,000 yuan, plus many gold items. (9) In the same year, the "September 18th" collection of comfort items raised dozens of boxes of medicine, canned food, and food. (10) In the same year, the "October 10th" collection of cotton clothing raised over 7,000 pieces of clothing. (11) The New Year's Charity Fair in the 28th year raised over 3,000 yuan. (12) A campaign was launched during the Lunar New Year for children to donate red envelopes, raising over 1,000 yuan.

Second—Other national salvation undertakings include: (1) In the spring of the 27th year, five representatives were sent to Guangdong Province to contact various youth organizations and present a flag to Commander Yu Fa-mou, expressing the Hong Kong overseas Chinese's ardent love for their motherland. (2) In the summer of the 27th year, multiple propaganda teams were sent to various places in Guangdong, including Zhongshan, Xiaolan, Taishan, Jiangmen, Shunde, Chencun, Daliang, and Rongqi, to conduct various national salvation propaganda activities. (3) When the All-China Students' Federation convened its Second National Congress in Wuhan, four representatives were sent to attend, and they were elected as executive committee members of the congress with the most votes, thereby establishing work connections with students across the country. (4) Last July, Chairman Li Zheng-yao represented Hong Kong students at the World Youth Peace Conference, conducting international propaganda along the way and establishing regular contact with the World Student Federation and various overseas aid organizations. (5) Not long ago, in order to participate in battlefield refugee services, an organization was formed for young people to return to the mainland to provide practical relief work, with four groups serving successively. In addition, there are daily activities, and the general assembly and various sections also have organizations such as relief classes, literacy classes for civilians, song groups, discussion groups, drama groups, and children's groups.

Current Situation

The people in charge of the Student Relief Society often say to reporters: "Our capabilities are still very weak, and we hope that advanced teachers from various schools will extend a warm hand to help us!" Their sincere attitude is evident in their words. However, it is already rare and valuable that Hong Kong's student movement, which is like a desert, can have such results. In terms of the number of school units that are members, it has also increased from dozens or hundreds to nearly six hundred school units today.

Now that the term of the second executive committee of the association has expired, a general meeting of representatives from various schools was convened at the YMCA on the 2nd of this month to elect the third batch of officers and revise its constitution based on past experiences. The current organizational overview is:

Representatives from universities are organized by sending two representatives from each school unit, forming the highest authority. A supervisory committee of seven members forms the supervisory committee, and an executive committee of forty-three members forms the executive committee, all of which are produced by the general meeting of representatives. The standing committee is organized by the election of fifteen people from the executive committee, plus the chairman and vice-chairman of the general meeting, for a total of seventeen people. The standing committee is divided into five departments: fundraising, publicity, secretariat, organization, and life. Each department has one minister and two deputy ministers.

Under the executive committee, there are also two district committees, each organized by nine people elected from schools in each district, and divided into four departments: general affairs, organization, publicity, and service. Below the district committee is the section committee, and below that is the school committee. The school committee is the constituent unit of the Student Relief Society.

The committee that regularly implements the work of the Student Relief Society is undoubtedly the standing committee. The secretariat of the standing committee has three sections: documentation, administration, and finance. The organization department has: planning section, investigation section, women's student group, and children's group. The publicity department has: publishing, song, drama, and overseas publicity sections. The fundraising department has: fundraising, auditing, and material collection sections. The life department has: library, academic, travel, and sports sections. The membership fees that support the operation of the association are collected from each school once per semester, with one yuan for primary schools, two yuan for secondary schools, and five yuan for universities.

Future Arrangements

After the executive and supervisory committees were elected from the general meeting of representatives on the 2nd of this month, the first executive committee meeting of the third session was held at the association's headquarters at 7:00 p.m. last night. Those present included representatives from 42 schools, including Li Zheng-yao from the University of Hong Kong, Zhu Zhu-you from Lingnan University, Xia Jie-hua from Guangzhou University, Xie Han-jie from Nanyang Business School, Xie Yu-de from Huaxia College, and Yu Min-yue from King's College, as well as Mr. Lin Jia-xiao, Zheng Zhi-huan, and Shi Wei-heng. It was a gathering of student leaders from all schools in Hong Kong and a symbol of the united front of the student movement.

Chairman Li Zheng-yao, representative of the University of Hong Kong, presided over the meeting, and the chairman and all representatives gave detailed reports. Then, the persons in charge of each department of the standing committee were elected. As a result, the chairman will be from the University of Hong Kong, and the deputy chairman will be from Huaxia College. The secretary of the secretariat will be from Guangzhou University, and the deputy secretaries will be from King's College and Fanglin Middle School. The minister of the publicity department will be from Lingnan University, and the deputy ministers will be from Fenghua Branch School and Queen's College. The minister of the organization department will be from Jin Xian Middle School, and the deputy ministers will be from Overseas Chinese Middle School and Minsheng College. The minister of the fundraising department will be from Wah Yan College, Hong Kong, and the deputy ministers will be from St. Stephen's Girls' College and South China Middle School. The minister of the life department will be from the National University, and the deputy ministers will be from Xinxiu Girls' School and Guangda Girls' School. From now on, they will shoulder sacred tasks.

According to the association's constitution, there is an administrative advisory committee. After unanimous approval, the consultants who were hired were:

Huang Dunhan, Lu Dechao, Wu Hanzhen, Lin Haobin, Cen Lixian, Su Ruohui, Chen Tieyi, Li Peiwu, Pan Jingxiu, Zhou Guanqin, Hu Qiaoxin, Ye Ruochao, Zheng Xiaosu, and Zheng Zhihuan. The Overseas Chinese Education Association sent three teachers, and the Eastern District Education Association sent two teachers. We sincerely hope that the experience of the consultants and the enthusiasm of the young students will bloom into working flowers. Regarding the outline of future work, after heated discussions, it was decided to:

1.  Intensify relief work;
2.  Strengthen international publicity work;
3.  Strengthen self-education of students;
4.  Pay attention to students' lives and interests;
5.  Establish closer ties with teachers and various community groups;
6.  Develop work within schools;
7.  Mobilize all Hong Kong students to participate in the work of the Student Relief Society;
8.  Continue to launch service groups to return to the mainland to serve.

One more point that deserves our attention is the call for a girls' student group, just like the way the children's group was organized in the past. Let the advanced female students mobilize those middle and primary school female students who only "study and study" and are unwilling to participate in group activities and national salvation work. Needless to say, this is a great work that is meaningful and targeted at the needs of the environment. We sincerely hope that its plans will be realized.

At around 10:00 p.m. last night, when the reporter attended the meeting and rushed back to the newspaper office to write the稿, they were still as close as family members, enthusiastically discussing the development of the association's affairs. Hong Kong has these young people, Hong Kong's student movement is hopeful, and the Chinese nation has these children, the future is bright. At the end of this article, I would like to respectfully wish the young friends to join hands closely, develop together, and earnestly work hard to carry out the arranged work!

### The Weather is Getting Colder: The Thermometer Dropped to 50 Degrees Yesterday; Hundreds of Homeless Refugees Huddle in Pity; Changeable and Unpredictable

The weather in Hong Kong has suddenly turned cold in recent days, which is rare for April in previous years. Since the afternoon rain last week, the weather has turned cold, and the cold has become even more severe on the 3rd and 4th. At 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd, the temperature in Hong Kong was 51.7 degrees, which was a drop of one degree compared to the coldest April in the past, namely 51.8 degrees recorded on April 4, 1905. However, the thermometer yesterday morning (5th) fell even further. At 7:00 a.m. yesterday, the temperature recorded was 50.4 degrees, which was more than one degree lower than the lowest temperature mentioned above, ten degrees lower than the lowest temperature in the same month last year, and seventeen degrees lower than the normal average temperature in April. If we compare the temperature recorded yesterday with the temperature recorded on the morning of last week, the difference is as much as thirty degrees. The change in the weather can be described as drastic. Therefore, the poor residents who have been sleeping on the streets for days are huddled in straw mats and tattered cotton, suffering from the cold and with many people sick. However, there are only three homeless shelters set up by the Homeless Relief Association in Hong Kong and Kowloon, with a total capacity of only over five hundred people. There are no fewer than thousands of homeless people in Hong Kong, so there are still hundreds of people who cannot get in. Therefore, the sudden drop in temperature in recent days has led to a sudden increase in the number of people seeking shelter. The three shelters are inevitably overcrowded. According to the people in charge of each shelter, each shelter has a fixed number of homeless people, but the weather has suddenly turned cold and the number of people seeking shelter has been increasing every day. As a charitable organization, it is not appropriate to refuse requests, even from people who are far away. Therefore, the number of people housed in each shelter has exceeded the fixed number by about ten people each day, and the equipment inside, such as cotton batting and burlap bags, is not enough for distribution. It is hoped that kind people from all walks of life will have pity on these poor people shivering in the cold wind and provide assistance, either by donating clothing or donating large sums of money, so that more shelters can be set up to spread kindness and allow the general homeless population to have shelter.

### China Travel Agency's Charity Performance Scheduled for This Month; Repertoire Includes "Phoenix City," etc.

The scripts have been set as "Phoenix City" and "Our Hometown." The former will be performed in Mandarin, and the latter is a Cantonese drama. It is reported that the Women's Federation has decided to perform the plays for two days at the Queen's or Entertainment Theatre this month, and all proceeds will be used for fundraising.

Special Report

### In the Refugee Camp:

— Tong Jing

As usual, Hong Kong's Director of Medical and Health Services, Dr. Selwyn Clarke, reports the number of refugees in the government's refugee camps in Hong Kong once a week. But apart from the increase or decrease in the number of people, nothing else can be seen. This report can be said to be almost like the daily tide report in the news column, such as when it rises and when it recedes, as if there is no other connection!

However, the refugee camp is advancing on the road to construction day by day. The people living inside, who initially came with a worried mind, are slowly dissipating their worries today. During the day, they work, study, play ball, and live a very orderly life.

These refugee camps are managed by the Emergency Refugee Relief Committee, which has three subcommittees responsible for all matters: the Industrial Committee, the Education Committee, and the Food Committee. I plan to report on the general situation in the camp based on these three items, following Dr. Selwyn Clarke's weekly reports.

Let's talk about industry first. These are handicrafts, and there are many kinds. There are tailoring, broom making, woodworking, mat weaving, and textiles. Recently, the Industrial Committee budgeted two or three thousand yuan to build a workshop in King's Park. Last month, Ms. Liang was sent by the committee to see a towel factory, and later reported the budget for purchasing four machines from the towel factory. The committee decided to build the factory first before starting to deal with it. Taking King's Park camp as an example, although there is currently one clothing army, in order to celebrate the April 4th Children's Day, they specially sewed 150 children's shirts in two weeks, so that the children could happily spend their Children's Day. Ma Tau Chung camp is also like King's Park, now speeding up the construction of bamboo broom Gui brooms, while North Point camp is weaving rattanware.

In terms of education, Ma Tau Chung camp has 230 children, of whom 165 are receiving primary education like children in ordinary schools. There are plans to enable them all to receive education, and it has been decided to hire another teacher with only one teacher at present. However, King's Park camp has 200 refugee children waiting to be educated, because of the lack of teachers, but the shorthand class has recently started.

What did the Education Committee prepare for the refugees on Children's Day? Yes. A grand celebration was held in each of the three camps in King's Park, Ma Tau Chung, and North Point, with music and dramas complete.

As for the refugees' food, there doesn't seem to be much to report here. They have two meals a day, but it's hard to say how nutritious they are.

### Xinhui Regained; The Four Weeks Around Jiangmen are All Under Our Control; Chaotic Situation of Repeated Hand-to-Hand Combat on Various Fronts; The Enemy's Emergency Forces are Rapidly Advancing on Shaping

[Macau Special Dispatch] After our army retreated from Jiangmen for the third time, the enemy's reinforcements continued to increase. As of the 4th, it was reported that our army had withdrawn from Huicheng and was continuing to resist on the outskirts of the city. According to continuing reports, after our army withdrew from the Jiangmen urban area yesterday, the enemy immediately advanced its vanguard into Jiangmen and engaged in fierce fighting with the forces defending Huicheng on Guifeng Mountain. The enemy used aircraft to assist in the battle, constantly bombing and destroying the temporary construction fortifications, which were completely destroyed. When the enemy crossed the defensive line and advanced towards Huicheng, our army, having lost the outer defense line, immediately moved its position and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat on the outskirts of the city. Until 12:30 p.m. yesterday (5th), our main force arrived and defeated the enemy troops near Huicheng, and our army recaptured Huicheng.

Our Army Controls All Fronts

Macau Quick News: For days, our army and the enemy have been fighting hand-to-hand near Jiangmen, charging back and forth, gaining and losing ground no less than ten times. In the end, since Jiangmen was indefensible, both our army and the enemy abandoned Jiangmen. Three days after our army withdrew, the enemy still did not dare to enter and garrison the city. At present, our army is deploying new positions in the vicinity to continue the resistance. Jiangmen is still under the control of our artillery. However, a unit of the enemy has crossed Jiangmen and is advancing towards Huicheng along the Ningyang Railway. All foreigners inside and outside Jiangmen have left the country. Most of the churches have been burned down by the enemy. It is feared that the refugees sheltering in the churches and the Chinese missionaries have been killed.

The Battle Situation on Various Fronts is Unclear

Since receiving the report on the battle between Tangbu Wai and Huicheng on the 3rd, no accurate news has been received in the past 24 hours. It is believed that the battle situation there is in chaos. According to foreign news from Guangzhou, a team of enemy artillery departed from Guangzhou on the 2nd to join the battle in the Jiangmen area, leaving Guangzhou's defenses extremely vulnerable.

The Enemy Urgently Invades Shaping

Special Dispatch from Xijiang: The enemy troops at Shaping once invaded some days ago but have already retreated after our army offered fierce resistance. However, since yesterday (1st), the enemy suddenly sent a large number of cavalry from the Heqing area to advance towards Shaping. Our troops stationed in Shaping immediately defended the area based on its dangerous terrain. The enemy hesitated and retreated, and there were no battles or killings until evening. However, it is reported that there has been an increase in enemy forces in the Heqing and Jiujiang areas, and it is speculated that they intend to launch a large-scale invasion of Shaping. At present, our regular army is being deployed from a certain direction to provide reinforcements, and a major battle will break out within days.

### × Fearing the Pressure of Our Mighty Army, the Northern Route × Lies Dormant; We Actively Deploy New-Type Positions; the Southern Section of the Guangdong Route × Troops Are Frequently Busy

(Special Dispatch from the North River) According to military intelligence here, recently the × army has temporarily changed its attempt to spy on Shao (Guan) and open the Guangdong Route. Instead, it is transferring troops to attack Xinhe, first seeking to consolidate the periphery of Guangzhou and eliminate our guerrilla forces. It is also stabilizing a certain military headquarters. Therefore, the battles on the northwest, Ting, and Qiongya routes of Guangdong Province in the past ten days have been very quiet, except for our army's counter-offensive. However, this action of the × army precisely demonstrates the prelude to its desire to expand its invasion in South China. The Guangdong military authorities have been more actively deploying in the past ten days in order to seize the initiative. The following is a record of the military situation on the northern route in recent days:

The × of Hua County Shortens the Defense Line

Since our main force and the central mechanized troops returned from northern Jiangxi and continued south to the front line and deployed new positions, the counter-offensive military affairs on the northern route have entered a new stage. The × entrenched in Conghua, northern Guangdong, is very panicked. In recent days, the new Jiangcun, Heng, Xiangshan, and Shengang Taipingchang areas in the southern section of the Guangdong Route have stepped up the deployment of trenches, barbed wire, and foxholes, with strict defenses, as if on the eve of a major battle. Fearing surprise attacks by our army and guerrillas, they have shortened the defense line, abandoning unnecessary strongholds and concentrating on defending important strongholds. In Hua County, except for Xiangshan, Shijiao, Hengtan, Longxiang, Pingshan, Street, Longkou, Xiaobu, and other places where there are still three or four hundred × soldiers stationed, the × soldiers dare not stay in the surrounding villages, and there are no × traces. In Conghua, the × soldiers in Shengang and Taipingchang on the front line have repeatedly invaded our positions in recent days, but after our new mechanized army arrived at the front line, they no longer dare to act rashly. The floating bridge built some time ago in preparation for an attack on our Aotou has now been dismantled for fear of our army's counter-offensive. All the bridges in the villages near Baishuitak, Shajian Village, and Taipingchang downstream of Shengang have been demolished, reportedly to prevent our army from Yue River from pursuing the enemy at places such as Zuilou. It was also found that more than a dozen aircraft were originally stationed near Dapu and the airport near Taipingchang. Recently, due to the active activities of our new air force, which frequently dispatched bombers to bomb × positions, fearing being bombed by us, some of them have flown to Guangzhou. There are now only three or four × aircraft left, all camouflaged. Also, it was found that on the Guangdong Route

X Intensifies the Construction of the Jiangge Bridge

Also, it was found that the × on the front of the southern section of the Guangdong Route has been extremely busy transporting recently. The × military vehicles from Guangzhou to Tingcun last week came and went in an endless stream all day long. Since the × army occupied Guangdong, it has been engaged in organizing the transportation from Guangzhou to various outer defense strongholds. In addition to the public route, the Guangdong-Han, Guangzhou-San, and Guangzhou-Kowloon railways are also used as much as possible. However, the railway bridge near Jiangcun on the Guangdong-Han line has not yet been repaired by × because it was bombed by us. Therefore, in recent days, the Guangdong Route × military vehicles can only reach Jiangcun, and the connection between Xinjie in Hua County and Guangzhou has not been restored. Now × regards Xinjie as an important place to invade northward along the Guangdong Route and shield our army's counter-offensive, and is eager to restore traffic from Guangzhou to Xinjie. Therefore, in recent days, technicians and engineers have been sent from Guangzhou to repair the Jiang Railway Bridge and nearby roadbed sleepers. It is heard that it will soon be passable by the military. This further shows the aggressive ambitions of the people.

### Guangdong Provincial Government Formulates Administrative Guidelines; Vigorously Bans Opium and Gambling; Eliminates Corrupt Officials

[Special Dispatch from Shaoguan] Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui of the Fourth War Zone and Chairman of Guangdong Province Li Hanhun believe that with the launch of the second phase of the war of resistance, politics is more important than military affairs, and mobilizing the people to participate in the war of resistance has become an urgent task at present. In order to cultivate a large number of cadres and carry out in-depth propaganda work in rural areas, they are planning to set up a training institute for party, government, and military cadres in a certain place in northern Guangdong. In order to understand the actual situation of each step and promote wartime administration, they convened a meeting of administrative commissioners and county magistrates of various districts in northern Guangdong last month to inquire and instruct everything, and re-formulated administrative guidelines, requiring all counties and cities to strictly follow and implement them. It is heard that its contents include the following principles: (1) Select anti-Japanese base areas in various counties, and public officials must not retreat across the border under any circumstances to maintain the implementation of government orders in various counties in the war zone. (2) All wartime work in various counties must adapt to military needs, such as organizing military transportation agencies, etc., to facilitate military progress. (3) Vigorously ban opium and gambling, eliminate corruption and clarify history and governance. (4) Unify the mobilization of the people in various counties, and strive for political coordination with the military and administrative harmony with the people to benefit the war of resistance.

### The × Army on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Road Reinforces the Xinhe Line

[Special Dispatch from Nanhai] After the bloody battle of Xinhe began, the × soldiers drew troops from the Jiujiang troops to reinforce the Xinhe lines. Unexpectedly, the × was annihilated in large numbers by us in recent days. The × chieftain Ando was quite anxious about this and actively requested assistance from various parties. It was found that yesterday (the 2nd), the troops stationed in the towns of Yanbu, Shaobian, Hubang, Beicun, Qicha, Xiushui, Dajianli, etc., within the Nanhai prefecture on the Guangzhou-Sanshui line were concentrated and transferred to the Jiang-Fo road along the Guangzhou-Yunnan highway to Jiujiang to provide assistance to Jiangmen.

### × Reinforcements Flood into Xinhe; Our Army in Sanshui Launches a Timely Counter-Offensive; No More × Traces in the Old Sanshui Area; The Rumor of × Attacking Lubao Is Self-Defeating

[Special Dispatch from Xijiang] After the Xinhe battle began, the Guangdong ×, due to insufficient troop sources, successively reinforced Xinhe with × soldiers from various lines. Therefore, the × entrenched in Southwest, Hekou, and Sanshui have moved south one after another in recent days, scurrying toward Jiujiang and Daliang. Only a small number of × soldiers are left on the Guangzhou-Sanshui line for guard duty, and the defenses are empty. Our counter-offensive army defending the north bank of the Xijiang River, considering that a large number of × soldiers have been transferred south for reinforcement, should seize the opportunity to launch a counter-offensive and quickly send out squads to attack and harass ×. Therefore, the × troops at the outposts of Huailangang, Mian, Hekou, Xinxu, Makou, Ganggen, etc. on the Sanshui front line have been lying dormant in one corner for the past few days, building strongholds and stubbornly defending themselves. Since the towns of Jiaoni, Laoyazhou, and Yisan in Sanshui across the river were recaptured by our army in Qingqi Zaotang yesterday, the × in Tieshanninlu no longer dare to cross the river to invade again. Therefore, there are no more × traces in the old Sanshui area. Fearing that our army would cross the river to attack, the × in Makou Langang and other places shelled our positions in Mafang, Qingqi, and Heli on the 29th and 30th, and sent rubber boats to patrol and spy around the estuary, pretending to attack. However, according to telephone calls from the front, the × at each stronghold have not moved rashly. Also, last week, transportation was frequent in the Yang, Lu, and Lubao West Road areas, and it was rumored that they would invade Lubao, an important stronghold on our Xiaobei River, within ten days in order to attack Guilin to the west. However, according to the latest intelligence, after the × army was transferred to support Xinhe, the × soldiers in that area have been successively transferred to other locations. The rumor that the × army would attack Lubao has been self-defeating.

### × Aircraft Fly in Batches to Invade Northern Guangdong

[Central News Agency, Wengyuan, 4th] At noon on the 3rd, three × aircraft bombed the Wengyuan, Conghua, and Xinfeng highways in three batches, successively dropping bombs in Yuexiang under Qingyuan, outside the West Gate of Xinfeng, Wan'an Gang under Fogang, and Yiniubeiji in Conghua, destroying several civilian houses and killing one person.

### The Four Counties Are Plagued by a Grain Shortage

[Special Dispatch from Xinhui] The four counties are not rice-producing areas. Daily food supplies depend on the Xijiang River. Since the Jiangmen battle, Shapin has been a place where the × and our armies fought fiercely, and the Xijiang waterway has been blocked as a result. Rice and grain cannot be supplied, and grain prices have risen day by day. After Jiangmen fell, the transportation hub fell into the hands of the ×, and grain prices in the four counties soared even more. Because there is not much grain left, a restriction method was proposed this month, limiting each person to buy one dime per day. As a result, a grain panic occurred throughout the four counties. The authorities are now seeking relief from the provincial government to solve the difficult situation. Also, since the × army invaded Jiangmen, iron riders have been dispatched in all directions. The general public is paying close attention to the situation in Hetang and Chaolian, both of which belong to Jiangmen. According to a friend who escaped from Hetang on the 2nd, the two armies fought fiercely after the start of the battle in Dingmen. The sound of shelling in Hetang was very clear. However, Hetang is surrounded by water on all sides and is located in a remote corner. It is not a military stronghold. The × army is focusing all its attention on the Jiangmen Shapin Huicheng line, so no × riders have arrived in Hetang yet. Only × aircraft occasionally come to scout. As for Chaolian, it has been found that the × army has arrived. The × soldiers who entered Chaolian mostly looted food. All rice, grain, and livestock were taken away in large quantities, so the food problem in Hetang is even more serious.

### Another Group of Overseas Chinese from Siam Returns to China to Participate in the War of Resistance

[Special Dispatch from Shantou] Since the start of the July 7th War of Resistance, no less than a thousand overseas Chinese from Siam have returned to China to serve. On the 30th of last month, the Siamese ship Meihua arrived in Shantou. There were also eleven young men from Siam, including Fu Mengba, Moke Shun, Xu Wenshan, Liao Chengzhang, Han Jie, Chen Weikang, Wang Luzhi, Han Ruiguang, Fu Hefu, Wu Kunyuan, and Xing Yili, who returned to China at their own expense to serve, and brought more than 40 books of medicines. They were received by the Anti-Japanese Comrades Association of Overseas Chinese from Siam in the city, and a tea party was held to welcome them, reporting on the recent situation in the motherland and the points that the Overseas Chinese National Service Corps attaches importance to. As for the medicines they brought, the association has also negotiated for duty-free entry. It was found that Mr. Fu and others are all professional drivers. They have now decided to take the medicines and serve under Commander Xue of a certain war zone. A telegram has been sent to report, and the Siamese Anti-Japanese Association is responsible for entertaining them before it is sent.

### From Huiyang to Chaoan (Continued)

— Lin Guangjin

3. Arriving in Chaoan

The day of rest has passed, and we continued to advance towards our destination. After passing through Fengshun and crossing Jieyang, we arrived in Chaoan after another four days of travel.

Chaoan, which had been ravaged and raped by the × people, was still very innocent and lively. The solemn houses still stood intact before people's eyes. The noise of people on the streets, the sound of buying and selling in shops and companies, the sound of machines in factories, and the sound of cars speeding on the roads jointly called out the prosperity and liveliness of the city. This made the people who ran out of the occupied areas see how free and happy, how lovely and prosperous, the children and land in the embrace of the motherland are, and how much it increased their hatred of the × people and their ambition to fight back to their old homes.

However, when the motherland encountered unprecedented difficulties, and in the midst of the mad tide of invasion raging, Chaoan had been threatened by the × people's artillery fire and smelled the strong smell of gunpowder. At the same time, like other places, it was often raided by fierce × aircraft and could no longer live a peaceful life.

The houses in front of the railway station have been deeply imprinted with many scars. This is a permanent souvenir given to the people of Chaoan by the × aircraft. However, the madness of the invaders can only awaken the sweet dreams of the children of Chaoan and cannot destroy their hearts of resistance. Just look at groups of young men and women who have enthusiastically raised their hands in resistance and shouted out that they do not want to be slaves.

Their blood is boiling. This boiling blood has not only written glorious historical facts, but will also mark the great charm of the times.

In the past, the young people here had organized many teams and followed the army to the front line to bravely struggle for the nation, giving spiritual encouragement to the people in the rear. Now, the call of "We want to follow the army to kill ×" has become noisy again. In fact, many enthusiastic male and female comrades have run to the camps of the national army to fight alongside the brave anti-Japanese soldiers for the freedom of the motherland. They are not for promotion or wealth, but for resisting fascist aggression and fighting for the freedom and liberation of the people.

The young people here are enthusiastic and brave. This can be seen from their work, which should be promoted and praised. However, their past work has not penetrated into the masses, and secondly, they have not been able to use it accurately. They have not really and widely mobilized a large number of young people to participate in the work, nor have they mobilized the people of the whole county to participate in the war of resistance in practice. At the same time, they have not particularly demanded the accuracy of the work, which often caused many unnecessary frictions internally and externally, and encountered many tragic lessons. This is an irreparable loss!

It is an undeniable fact that the work of mobilizing the people in Chaoan has not been widely carried out. On the one hand, the work done by the general youth comrades in Chaoan is not enough and not popular enough. On the other hand, the local party and government have not provided active political leadership, which is also a decisive reason.

The weaknesses pointed out above are completely objective facts that should be overcome urgently. Do not let it continue or expand, otherwise it is very likely to develop into a serious crisis. The previous fall of Huiyang, although there were other reasons, the existence of this weakness was also a significant link, so that the people of the whole county did not widely mobilize to exert their great power to resist aggression and defend their homeland. As a result, they were at a loss when the × people landed. Not only did they fail to give the × people a severe blow, but they also failed to inflict a considerable price on the × people, and a series of tragedies were staged—I don’t know how many compatriots were killed! Oh! This bloody lesson before our eyes is something we can never forget. The children of Chaoan today, bearing this blood-red lesson, should be vigilant, ah.

### Hollywood Companies Strive to Shoot War Films

In the environment full of gunpowder in the Spanish war, the Sino-Japanese war, and the entire world, Hollywood film companies are currently competing to shoot war blockbusters.

In the film city, most of the studios have recently had the sound of swords and guns, presenting a tense situation of war. The actress put peppermint oil on her eyes, so that when the male lead goes to war, tears will naturally fall in the smile. Every war movie is like this.

Now, Hollywood is producing all the films that can be shot. After Paramount's Invasion is completed, we may even find a film that exposes plunder.

When Griffith shot The Birth of a Nation, he spent a lot of money on war shots, but the cost of shooting war films now is more than the cost at that time. Temporary soldiers are paid $10.50 a day for filming, and renting firearms costs $50 per thousand.

In Selznick's studio, the war shots of Gone With The Wind have already started filming. The scene of burning Atlanta is very grand, and these war shots are all filmed using directorial techniques. Some of them are very magnificent.

There is a Stanbaugh in Hollywood who has a lot of military equipment. He also collects a lot of military equipment from ancient times in front of the Paramount Film Company. When film companies need military equipment to shoot war films, they rent it from him. Recently, the demand has surged, and he has made a fortune.

Because various companies have recently been competing to shoot war films, Stanbaugh has been very busy renting out military equipment. Sometimes, a film needs 250 Austrian-style rifles, and the number of Chinese-style rifles required is the same. He also installs smokeless gunpowder in these guns. The inside of the cartridge case is filled with black, fire-starting ammunition. They are used differently for filming during the day or at night.

Even in Union Pacific, although it is not a real war film, when Zomegai led his men to resist the Indian riots, he used 210 rifles, and those thugs were at a disadvantage because they were holding old rifles from before 1863. Similarly, in Heritage of the Desert, there is a scene that uses 50 rifles.

Stanbaugh's biggest deal is to supply hundreds of Spencer-style new guns and all the machine guns in his collection, but the anti-aircraft guns and heavy artillery have caused problems. Although the government can help, some of the military equipment must be designed by the film company, so even if it is not formal combat, it will give people a deep impression. When Warner started filming Juarez, the war shots will be filmed in Borpon. They have 400 old-fashioned rifles and some new-style guns, which are enough for the background of this film.

Dodge City, starring Errol Flynn, needs 100 bulky old-style guns and some short-caliber pistols, but there are not enough of them, so the general extras who are not actually fighting all hold fake guns made of rubber.

Stanbaugh's armory has a total of 460 British-made Lee-Enfield rifles, which are recently loaded onto trucks to RKO every day to supply all the war scenes in The Light That Failed for filming.

### Recent News from the International Film Scene

Two months ago, when "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" premiered in the capital of the Netherlands, the audience was extremely crowded, but the local film censorship board prohibited children under the age of 14 from visiting, on the grounds that "the horror scenes in the film are sufficient for children to experience adverse psychological effects." For this reason, the RKO authorities had previously sought the opinion of Walt Disney, the producer of the film, and wanted to delete these so-called "horror scenes," but Walt Disney resolutely refused, saying, "I would rather sacrifice a part of the audience than make the entire audience see something that is untrue and incomplete." So the children of the Netherlands did not have the opportunity to see this film.

Recently, a large number of American films have been banned in Italy, including two, one is "Marie Antoinette" and the other is "The Adventures of Marco Polo," which are also on the list of banned films. The plots and content of these many films have not offended Italy at all. It is only in a film that there is a scene depicting Italians eating pasta. The Italian film censorship board believes that it contains a satirical element, so without asking questions, all films with similar descriptions are banned.

The discrimination against Jewish people in Germany and Italy has been raging in recent months. Unexpectedly, they now want to infringe upon the Jewish actors in Hollywood. Not long ago, the Fascist Party newspaper "Tevere" in Rome said to their people that all the comedy films starring Chaplin, the Marx Brothers, and the Ritz Brothers must be obscene because they are all Jewish, and the Italian people should boycott them.

The war newsreel "Kidli and Spain" jointly produced by Paramount, United Artists, and Universal in Spain has been filmed from the year before last until now and has already reached 120,000 feet. It has recently been decided to reorganize and edit it, remove the dross and keep the essence, divide it into three episodes, and distribute it to various countries for screening.

### Hitler and Actresses

The world-famous German leader Hitler is still a bachelor, but his relationship with women is very close, especially actresses. If you don't believe it, look below.

…Leni Riefenstahl…

Everyone knows that Hitler hates Jews, but there is nothing strange in the world. His lover Leni Riefenstahl is a Jew. Leni is a red star on the screen, the daughter of a blacksmith. In 1923, she began working as a dancer in a dance hall in Munich. Soon she transferred to the film industry. Hitler and she began to know each other at a meeting of a famous musician. Then they began to fall in love. The Minister of the Army, Goering, found out about this romance and advised Hitler not to fall in love with a Jewish woman. But Hitler's answer was, "This is my private life, please don't interfere." As a result, Goering left angrily, and Hitler and Leni's love affair increased rather than decreased, and he hired her to guide photography and skating. A French newspaper once reported that Hitler had fallen into Leni's love net, and said that Leni had criticized Hitler in this way, "On the battlefield, he may be a general, but in the field of love, he is only a child." Hitler was furious when he saw this, so he did not allow this French newspaper to be sold in Germany.

…Marlene Dietrich…

Marlene Dietrich is a big star in Hollywood and one of the most internationally renowned German actresses. When Hitler issued the order "All film stars and technicians living abroad must return to the country and make films in the motherland" six years ago, she also returned to Germany. The next day, Hitler sent a special envoy to visit, conveying his kind intentions and saying to her, "Germany welcomes you with open arms and has prepared an excellent position for you, appointing you as the president of German films." Marlene Dietrich only replied faintly, "Thank you." Out of love, Hitler sent people to send flowers to Dietrich every day from the third day, but two months later, the special envoy who sent the flowers suddenly returned the flowers to Hitler, because Dietrich was not used to this kind of life and had quietly embarked on a journey to Hollywood the night before.

### Star Chinese Team's Last Match in Hong Kong: 1-0 Victory Over the Chinese Union; Star Chinese Team Fields Many New Players on the Day; Chinese Union Frequently Attacks But Unfortunately Fails

The Star Chinese Football Team played its third match against the Chinese Union at the Caroline Hill ground yesterday at 5:30 PM. The weather suddenly turned cold, and it was not a holiday, so the number of spectators was sparse. The Governor of Hong Kong, Sir 富國, made a special appearance to watch the "final act" and witness the skills of our overseas Chinese players.

The lineup for the Star Chinese team was slightly different from before. The goalkeeper was changed to Zhang Huiwen, the left back was the experienced veteran Deng Yuehan, the right winger was Wu Zhanshi, and since 龍歷武 was absent, Xia Zhixiang filled in. Wu Zhanshi and Deng Yuehan both performed admirably. Deng was known for his familiarity with the middle road, while Wu was known for his quick passing. Goalkeeper Feng Huiwen showed good skills, but was slightly inferior to Li Baitang. Xie Qingfu, the "new Li Huitang," scored a goal with the help of Wu Zhanshi yesterday, ultimately defeating the Chinese Union with a score of 1-0.

Looking at Star Chinese's × games, one always feels that the whole team's progress is slow and the style of play is outdated. Tracing the source, it is all due to the players dribbling too much. Modern tactics all adopt fast passing and dribbling, and a vigorous sprinting style of play. Recalling the performance of the English team Corinthians during their tour, it can be used as a lesson. During the war, the Corinthians players all aimed to obtain the ball as quickly as possible, and then pass it to their teammates. As soon as there was an opportunity, they would sprint or shoot. Since South China's players had several discussions, they imitated Corinthians' M-style formation. In the previous season, South China was able to win the league championship using this strategy. This season, many strong teams in Hong Kong have adopted this strategy, and their results have improved rapidly. Star Chinese's forwards have covering but no sprinting, so the final kick is often blocked by the opponent. At the same time, the shooting skills of Star Chinese's forwards are not yet perfect. Long shots are often inaccurate, and close shots miss the target. Therefore, in the first match against South China, they lost 0-3. Star Chinese had many chances to win on a regular basis, but unfortunately, they were lost due to lack of experience and slowness.

Yesterday's game was an improvement over the first two games. The victory of Star Chinese was due to the fact that the midfielders were not restrained and were able to attack frequently, helping the progress of the forwards. However, throughout the whole game, Hong Kong's United team often had the advantage. The reason why they could not reverse the defeat was because their shooting was inaccurate, and their luck was also not good.

Several players from the Hong Kong Chinese Union team were absent, and their strength was also affected. They were filled in by veterans such as Ye Beihua. After returning from the World Games, Ye had rarely been seen on the field. Yesterday, he put on his uniform again and reprised his skills. However, his skills were rusty and he lacked the strength to perform well. Chen Guangyu made his debut in a major battle and had many flaws, often being rushed past the defense by Wu Zhanshi. He still lacks experience in defense. If he works hard, he will surely become a good player in the future.

Yesterday, the Hong Kong Chinese Union team was loose and disorganized, with no connection to speak of, and ultimately lost 1-0. Five minutes into the first half, Star Chinese struck quickly. Wu Zhanshi attacked swiftly on the right, unstoppable. When Wu dribbled into the goal area, he immediately swept a shot. Zhang Rongcai turned around and slapped the ball to the corner. Xie Qingfu was in front of the goal and gently pushed it in, opening the scoring with a 1-0 lead. Twelve minutes into the game, Dehui dribbled the ball and attacked. Deng Yuehan collided with him, and the ball went strongly to the right, where it was obtained by Deng Guangshen, who advanced like a rushing wave. However, the final kick was weak and was saved by Zhang Huiwen. Fourteen minutes into the game, Cai Yuehan received a clever pass from Xie Qingfu and shot in front of the goal. Rongcai made a timely save, only conceding a corner kick. Twenty minutes into the game, Shuiyi launched a solo attack, but his shot was saved by Huiwen and landed in front of Guangsen. Guangsen was merciful and slow to act, missing a golden opportunity to score.

Switching sides, the game remained evenly matched. Shi Jin worked extremely hard and frequently launched attacks, but they were all slightly off target and to no avail. The most tense moment was in the third minute, when Hong Kong surrounded the Star Chinese goal. Dehui, Shi Jin, and Beihua all fired shots, but none hit the mark. The fans all sighed. After that, the attack and defense were balanced, and the game was uneventful. Until the end of the game, the Hong Kong Chinese Union lost 0-1. Star Chinese, in its three games, lost twice and won once, completing its mission and will leave Hong Kong tomorrow.

The South China Athletic Association held a banquet at the Guangzhou Restaurant last night at 8:00 PM to welcome the Singapore Chinese team, expressing the hospitality of the host. More than a hundred Chinese and Western guests attended the event, which was extremely lively and continued until late at night. The rosters of both teams are listed below:

### Rong Yip Brand Championship Final: Kitchee vs. Wellington

The Rong Yip Brand competition, organized by the Hong Kong Small-Sided Football Association, will feature the championship final between Kitchee and Wellington at the Wan Chai Southorn Playground today at 5:00 PM, according to the schedule. Kitchee is the champion of the Chan Dong Cup, and recently eliminated the star-studded Wu Ying team 3-1. Their strength is truly astonishing. However, Wellington is not a weak team either. Every time they play, they pose a serious threat to the Zhang team. Recently, they have also gained the assistance of the small-ball star Cheng, which makes them even more formidable. When the two strong teams meet, it is impossible to predict who will be the champion of the Rong Yip Brand until the very end. The names of the players on both sides are as follows: (Kitchee) Li Zhaorong, You Hua Yu, Zhang Rensheng, Yu Qingyuan, Luo Weijie, Lin De Pu, Luo Zhimin, Deng Riming, Li Da Yi, Huo Yaohua, Yin Zule, Zhu Jincheng, Ye Guoying, Chen Jiali; (Wellington) Li Mulun, Zheng Yingquan, Li Huilin, Deng Songbai, Zhang Xinhan, Lin Huasheng, Chen Jinpei, Chen Cai, Lin You, Zeng Huai, Zhong Wei.

### Shanghai Football Association: Amending the Constitution for the Next Session; Seeking Opinions from All Teams for Submission to the Council for Decision; The Group C Champion Will Not Be Produced Due to Field Issues

[Shanghai Communication] The Shanghai Football Association officially announced the resolutions of the Executive Committee meeting yesterday (31st). For the 1938-39 league season, West Foss won the Group A championship based on the first round robin scoring. Donghua Association won the reserve group championship. The British Navy won the Group B championship. Due to incomplete matches in Group C, it was decided not to produce a champion. Since the British Navy has won the Group B championship, it can be promoted to Group A according to the rules. The fourth-place team in Group A, 震日, will be relegated to Group B. However, the British Navy has frequent personnel changes and inconsistent strength, and may give up this opportunity, which will be taken over by the runner-up North West Children. (According to the 1937-38 season, the Army of Group B abandoned its promotion, and was replaced by the runner-up, 伐亚.) Currently, Lidu is tied for the lead with North West Children, one point ahead. With the strength of Lidu, exclusively occupying the police force, there is no problem. Now, it is regrettable that the schedule cannot be completed and no champion is produced due to the parking of cars at each stadium. However, the club has already won the Scott Cup and the Junior Cup, and the small internal group champion is not significant. In the Executive Committee meeting held the day before yesterday, the proposal to amend the League Constitution for the next season was raised. The Committee decided to announce this proposal to all clubs on April 15, and convene another committee to discuss the opinions of the members' associations, and submit them to the next Council for approval or rejection. (Each member club in the Council has one representative present.)

### Basketball Games Last Night: South China and South China Win; Li Xing Easily Defeats Red Star in Group B

In the public men's basketball games, two games of Group A and one game of Group B were held in the Qingnianhui gymnasium last night. In the first game of Group A, Hong Kong University vs. South China, the strength of the two sides was very different. South China's defense and offense were consistent. Huang Zuode, Li Jiesheng, Chen Zanyin, and Chen Zandun skillfully scored baskets, and Zhong Ling also attacked relentlessly. Hong Kong University's Zhang Shaomian, Qin Zhangjun, and Xu Kunlun had good long and short-range attacks. Lei Mengdi and Yang Hua were able to calmly respond to the challenge. However, South China's brilliance was fully revealed, with the momentum of Mount Tai pressing on an egg. Hong Kong University tried its best to support itself, but it was ineffective, and it was greatly defeated.

At the start of the game, Huang Zuode, Zhong Ling, and Chen Zanfu attacked from three directions and all scored. Hong Kong knew that the teachers were coming fiercely, and Zhang Shaomian rose up and Xu Kunlun also made several gains. However, South China made a comeback. Chen Zanfu and Chen Zanyin attacked from the left and right, and Zhong Ling, Huang Zuode, and Li Junsheng intercepted from three directions, spreading good news. Hong Kong University's Yang Xuhua and Lei Menglian fought back from the left and right. Qin Zhangjun and Xu Kunlun engaged in close combat for a long time and recovered several domains. Xu Shaomian also crossed the river on horseback and gained some ground. However, South China launched a surprise attack, and the entire line of Hong Kong University collapsed, losing 39-56.

In the second game, South China faced Guangda. The two sides did not play well. South China was tightly organized, while Guangda's defense was good, but its attack was scattered. South China's Shi Zhenzhi scored successfully, and Shi Zhenyuan and Gan Jiemin made good contributions. Guangda's Wu Yi performed well yesterday, but Zheng Yu missed opportunities frequently, and Lu Jin was quite objective. After the start of the game, Xiao Jiemin was the first to fall into the trap, and Shi Zhenzhi worked together. Wu Zhao launched a counterattack and scored. Zheng Tangkun and Zhang Rongcai intercepted from two directions and did not betray their mission. Liang Jianghong fought repeatedly, and Chen Zhaohui launched an attack. However, South China's military appearance was at its peak. It was seen that the Shi brothers were taking things from the bag. Therefore, Guangda pursued and the points were close. In the first half, South China took the lead with 19-18. Changing sides, Guangda released three arrows in a row and all hit the mark, ascending to 27-24. South China was surrounded by Chu songs, so it mobilized Shi Zhenzhi's reinforcements, which were quite powerful, and scored baskets from near and far. Shi Zhenda and Chen Xiqiu also launched attacks. Guangda's Chen Zhaoxiang launched a counterattack, but the situation had passed. When the gold was struck and the military was dismissed, South China won 56-39.

In the last game, Red Star fought Li Xing. Red Star was not Li Xing's opponent at all. The game became one-sided. After the start of the game, Huang Jiucheng scored 24 points in a row. Red Star only started recording after the counterattack. Li Xing pressed on even harder. At the end of the game, Li Xing easily defeated the Red Star team 107-38. The results of each game are as follows:

(South China)

(Total score 40)

(Guangda)

(Total score 32)

(Hong Kong University)

(Total score 39)

(South China)

(Total score 56)

(Li Xing)

(Total score 107)

(Red Star)

(Total score 38)

### Spectators of Ball Games Should Have Three Supplementary Laws

— Zhuoyue

(1) Preparation Law: Since we ourselves are interested in watching ball games, it is of course better to be more focused and specialized, such as basketball or football. Then, before a certain game starts, we should have considerable supplementary preparation, filling our minds with knowledge about the ball game. If we don't even know the rules of this kind of game, or how each position should play... how can we talk about criticism and research? Therefore, I think the necessary preparation is not in prediction or criticism... but in how to find the knowledge about the ball game in advance and instill this knowledge into our brains. This is true preparation.

(2) Practice Law: Although we have obtained a lot of knowledge from all sides, is this knowledge correct? We have to practice at the ball field to prove it. We also need to practice a lot, and then we can find out what is right or wrong. Therefore, if we want to increase our ability to observe and criticize ball games, we must not only watch more ball games, but also practice ball games ourselves in order to fundamentally gain the ability to observe and criticize. Therefore, the second law for ball game spectators is the "Self-Practice Law." We must first have the ability to practice or specialize in a certain ball game ourselves, so that we can increase our interest in watching and other things.

(3) If Law: These laws can also be called the satisfaction and annoyance laws. That is, if something is successful (satisfying), we will continue to do it, and the effect will also increase greatly. If we fail, we will be annoyed and unwilling to do it, and the results will decrease accordingly. From this point of view, the third law that we, the people who watch ball games, should have is the "Satisfaction Law." If everyone can always watch the ball game with a satisfied attitude, then the effect obtained will of course be greater than anything else. Because no matter how good or bad the team is, it can satisfy us. Why? For good teams, we can certainly gain a proper understanding and model of techniques, etc., and we can also make corrections on our own side, which makes us satisfied. But bad teams can also give us a negative understanding (what is bad). Since we have obtained a correct concept from other parties, indirectly, we are led to improve in the correct direction from good, so that our skills reach perfection. This is also a definite place. Therefore, the third law for us to watch ball games is to exchange the spirit of research for "satisfaction." Therefore, when we watch ball games, we should have the concept that - regardless of whether the teams playing are good or bad, we should have two views: "What is good and where is it good," and "What is bad and where is it bad." We can increase our willingness to prepare and practice more if we get satisfaction from watching ball games, prepare more fully, and practice more effectively. The better the effect, the more satisfaction. Because we are satisfied, we will definitely increase our will to do and our spirit of practice. If everyone can do this, it will be easy to revitalize the sports of the Hong Kong compatriots, and the sports cause will be more optimistic.

### The Rebirth of Poetry

— Chen Xianwen

Following the unfolding of the war of resistance in the past twenty months, and the rapid changes in social reality, poetry, which is considered the most direct way to convey emotions and experiences of life, and which sensitively reflects social activities (including political issues), and whose effect of arousing emotional resonance is more effective and faster than novels, this "literary weapon" has also clearly appeared in another posture, and the emergence of this posture also contains countless progressive factors.

What kind of poetry were we reading yesterday? — Poets wrote poems like "The azaleas are red, oh, the heart of a young woman?" or poems like "Although it is warm in the sun now, but, oh, west wind, because of, desolate grass and yellow leaves, pity each other!" As for those poems with obscure artistic conceptions and skillfully woven sentences arranging words like "camel bells, yellow sand," and the more progressive poems, they sang "life flows like a muddy river," etc.; but today, we can only find these poems in people's old papers, and their place in newspapers and periodicals has been replaced by emerging poems. The emerging poets sing of new strength, the strength of battle, capturing the transformation of social reality, adding a strong smell of gunpowder between the lines, strengthening the emotions of agitation, and these emotions are also appearing in a new posture.

Like other arts, poetry also follows history; yesterday, reflecting the realistic factors of society, poetry took the expression of individual feelings and the feelings of a specific group as its highest task. However, that kind of social reality quickly became the past. Since a new era has arrived, poets have seized the needs of the new social reality and expressed poetry with their own clear worldview and pure emotions, just like the poems of past heroes who denied the magical heavenly kingdom, like proletarian poetry that denied bourgeois poetry, the emerging poets also deny the paradigms of previous poetry, appearing with a brand new formation to complete the higher historical task of the current unique society.

However, the fact that poetry denies the paradigms of the past and develops a new path does not mean that it rejects all previous interpretations of poetry. For example, Tolstoy, who valued emotion, emphasized that poetry is a tool for conveying emotions, and it is a means for spiritual union, which is still applicable now and will also be applicable in the future. Each new form of poetry develops along a certain criterion, but this does not mean that we should use poetry to convey any emotion, such as those extremely personal atmospheres in the past or the emotional clichés that can only express the feelings of a specific group, because they have been replaced by the higher emotions created by the realistic factors of the current stage of society, and have lost the driving force for historical development at the current stage. On the contrary, this is enough to become an obstacle to the progress of the times, so it is meaningless to express it in poetry.

Therefore, some people believe that poets at the current stage should also abandon the romantic style that is most suitable for expressing personal emotions. There are different opinions regarding this interpretation; Gorky, to a certain extent, supported romanticism. We know that positive romanticism can strengthen people's will to live, can awaken people's resistance to the oppression of stubborn reality, and not like those in the past who pulled people from reality to the illusory world, did not take a critical attitude towards reality, but only indulged in elusive ideas, and as a result, still made people indulge in negative thinking and no positive action.

Poetry has a new future in present-day China. It is taking the same steps as other spiritual cultures, stepping on living reality. It must abandon the emotional dregs of the era and replace them with new ones, and use a clear worldview to promote the progress of social reality through the form of poetry.

### "Spring"

— Liu Lan

Some people love the season of yellow leaves fluttering and fallen flowers covering the ground. Walking leisurely in the path in the setting sun of autumn, sitting with their own lonely shadows; or sitting idly in the courtyard, gazing at the yellow fences, leisurely counting the fallen flowers, but people say, "This is too old and late in life, young people should not be so aloof from the world." However, it is said that the poet's wise eyes can still see "life" in autumn.

There are also people who love the cold winter, a vast expanse of white snow, a world of glass. It is said that this is also the temperament of a poet, and even more the character of a hero. My thoughts then galloped in the wilderness, the plains, and the icy and snowy land. What is the state of mind of the fighters who are doing great work? Cursing or appreciation? Let the facts fill in the answer!

But I, an ordinary and mediocre person, long for spring, a vibrant and energetic season!

A voice sounded in my ear; "Spring is coming!" I don't know who whispered to me so softly. The tone is so gentle and harmonious. Adding fuel to the fire, it will surely become a moving love song. But I said faintly: "There is no spring here." Perhaps indignant at this indifferent attitude, there was no reply, and the footsteps of the visitor gradually disappeared into the distance.

Pushing open the window, I looked up. The sky was gray and dark, filled with dark clouds. A gust of wind blew today, could it be bringing the news of spring? I wondered, but what came towards me was a pungent smell of blood, not the breath of spring. "There is no spring here," I murmured again. I hurriedly closed the window.

Sailing on a boat of reverie, drifting on the sea of memory; all winter, I recited Shelley's famous line, "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" Yes, spring will be coming soon. But now, winter is gone, but there is still no spring here.

Peanut trees, flocks of birds flying around. A scene of warmth and a charming landscape, also easy to make people yearn for, but the fields of Jiangnan, no, the entire land, is no longer peaceful and solemn, demons have brought great disturbances. The plains are dotted with ruins; broken walls and remnants, bloody corpses, violated girls, suffering children. May I ask, is this a symbol of spring?

I tell you: "There is no spring here!"

However, oh, I still want to tell you: "Spring will come." After the sweat of cultivation and the irrigation of blood, the earth will return to spring, and the fields will ripple with intoxicating spring breeze.

But, before it's over, I want to ask you, "How will you sweat and bleed for the earth—our mother?"

"Hey, tell me, tell me!"

### Dedication

— Zhi Lin

I come to your grave

To offer you a glass of wine, a flower

Hero! Please drink this cup

Your flesh and blood,

Have laid the glorious foundation for success,

Please let the flower

Adorn your lapel

——The flower of forgetfulness

The red wine,

Symbolizes war and blood, and

This glorious flower

Symbolizes victory,

Hero!

I offer a cup of red wine

And a fragrant flower

On your tombstone

To bless you

A peaceful and long sleep.

### Stealing the City

— Du Youhui

It was an autumn evening, and a biting north wind was already blowing in this central plain area. The sky was dark and cloudy, and our army had moved to a new defensive line in the suburbs to garrison. That evening, our army was preparing to launch a counterattack on the small city, because the headquarters had received intelligence that the enemy had suffered heavy casualties in the hard fighting in recent days, and now only more than 300 people were left guarding the city, waiting for reinforcements.

At one o'clock in the morning, the troops of our army moved out. The brothers of the 9th Company of our army were dispersed and surrounded the city from various small roads. They crawled like black ants in the silent wilderness.

Suddenly, a loud "Boom!" and "Rumble!" explosion shattered the silence of the night sky, followed by a burst of machine gun fire and hand grenades. There was a clamor of killing, running, and wailing in the city. The order in the city was obviously very chaotic!

At this time, it was reported that our army had reached the suburbs. They still thought that the enemy had discovered our army's attack. But after a while, the gunfire gradually thinned out, until it disappeared. However, on the city wall, a national flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun was suddenly erected, vaguely fluttering in the night sky.

"Our troops have occupied the city!" the company commander said.

"Which troop is it?" the brothers asked, but there was no answer. Everyone was wondering who this elusive troop was.

"Could it be an empty city ploy by the enemy!" one brother said.

"Heavens!"

"No—it can't be, didn't you see that the city gate is already open? There are even people singing 'March of the Volunteers' on the gate!" the company commander said with great certainty. The sentry returned and confirmed the news, so we marched into the city.

"I wonder which troop entered first?" This question has not been answered, and it is revolving in the minds of every brother.

Our army entered the city. On the road lay some corpses of Japanese soldiers and countless abandoned guns and techniques, scattered here and there.

The troops of our army assembled. The regimental commander stood in front of the troops and spoke:

"Brothers! Who do you think was the troop that first attacked and entered here tonight?" Everyone was silent. He continued: "It is this group of young soldiers who grew up in the enemy's artillery fire!…" He pointed his finger at the group of refugee teenagers who were accompanying the army on the side. They were probably between six or seven and fifteen or sixteen years old. "They are so young! But their understanding of the war of resistance is deeper and more resolute than anyone else! They know that it is better to be on the front line with their fathers and brothers than to be slaves of a fallen province. They are willing to carry leather boxes of bullets for their fathers and brothers, share the hardships of their fathers and brothers, and may even be able to help fight the enemy. Tonight, this heroic and commendable act is a good example of them…… Tonight, more than a dozen of these young soldiers automatically sneaked into the city before our troops left the city, using hand grenades to bombard the enemy. The enemy thought that our army had attacked the city in the middle of the night. They shot at each other in the dark, and as a result, they only killed their own people, so they were in a chaotic mess, and fled out of the city……" At this point, the brothers laughed.

"I feel very heartbroken! And ashamed! Because I cannot give these useful children the opportunity to receive education, and make them live a life on the battlefield of exile…… At the same time, we also feel very fortunate! Because from the actions of this group of young soldiers, it is enough to see the bright future of the Chinese nation. China has countless such young soldiers, and China will not perish! The glorious responsibility of China's future lies with this group of future masters to complete it!… Brothers! We want to pay a solemn salute to this group of young soldiers……"

Our entire team was ecstatic. We embraced this group of young soldiers amidst the cheers of "Long live the liberation of the Chinese nation!" and the singing of "March of the Volunteers." Our anti-Japanese spirit was all inspired by this heroic and ingenious behavior!

This night. The people in this city spent it warmly in the crucible of a nation.

Note: What is written in this article is all true. It is a fact witnessed by the head of the military service group who returned from Changsha. This group of refugee children from the military are all from the occupied areas, and they came out with their fathers and brothers. They are unwilling to leave their fathers and brothers, so that they can set off together. Until recently, the authorities paid attention to transporting these children to the rear for centralized training. These are the new anti-Japanese army that is coming. Their anti-Japanese ability and consciousness are naturally more heroic than today's soldiers.

### The Snow in Manchuria

— Shu Qun

"Get out of here, you dog, stay away from me!"

She scolded him, and he couldn't help but revert to the naivety of his childhood, and moved closer to her, grabbing her sleeve;

"You're not allowed to scold anymore!"

"Let go of me, you dog!"

"I don't care if you scold me, I'll slap you in the face if you scold me again!"

"Get lost, I'm not afraid of you, I'm telling you, you dog!"

"Then I'll tear your clothes to pieces and freeze you!"

"I'm not afraid of freezing, not afraid of freezing!"

"I'll leave you with not a shred of clothing on, standing naked on the road."

She might not be afraid of the cold, but she was afraid of shame; so she didn't dare say:

"I'm not afraid of shame, not afraid of shame!"

Instead, she retorted:

"Your family must not have any sisters, you don't have a mother, you were sewn out of a crack in the rock!"

At this point, he failed—descending into the boredom of a game that had been forgotten. He let go of her sleeve, and moreover, apologized to her.
