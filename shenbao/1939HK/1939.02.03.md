### The Great Significance of the United States Actively Joining the Democratic Front

In recent years, the frenzied actions of aggressors in the world have compelled other peace-loving nations to form, unexpectedly, a democratic front to resist aggression, its primary constituents being Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. The attitude of Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in supporting the democratic front and cooperating with each other has been evident for some time, due to their interconnected relationships in Europe and their ties as members of the League of Nations. The United States, however, due to its geographic location and its status as a non-member of the League of Nations, has historically adopted a more passive attitude toward supporting the democratic front. However, as a result of the rapid development of the international situation, aggressive nations are scheming to unite more closely in order to collude for evil. Peace-loving democratic nations naturally feel the threat of these mad aggressors more keenly, and also realize that isolation and division are not viable strategies. Nations that have already joined are cooperating more closely, and nations that have not yet formally joined are bravely and actively doing so, bringing even greater strength to bear. This is an inevitable trend in the development of the international situation, and it is also the basis for the United States' necessary active support of the democratic front.

The foreign policy of the United States in recent months has gradually revealed the direction in which it should move, but it has not yet been embodied or activated in concrete terms. Even President Roosevelt's repeated attacks on aggressors in the world have not yet gone beyond the scope of passivity. The most active expression of this should be President Roosevelt's repeated remarks and policies since the opening of the U.S. Congress, especially his secret remarks yesterday in the Senate Military Affairs Committee meeting. According to information leaked from various sources, President Roosevelt will adopt a new foreign policy, which can be summarized as follows: (1) Defining a policy toward Europe: If something happens in Europe, the United States will be willing to do its best to support the democratic front to resist dictators; (2) Requesting the Senate Military Affairs Committee to designate France as the United States' front line to cope with future wars between democratic countries and dictatorial countries; (3) The United States has decided to sell aircraft and other military supplies to France and other democratic countries. The publication of these messages has aroused different reactions in countries around the world. The impact will bring about an epoch-making change in international politics, and its significance is undoubtedly great.

Regarding President Roosevelt's epoch-making foreign policy, the first thing we should recognize is its certainty. The emergence of every country or policy is not a subjective expression of a political party or an individual, but a reflection of the objective facts of the country and the international situation at that time. Moreover, the implementation of each policy requires the support of this objective situation. The certainty of President Roosevelt's new foreign policy lies in this. The times have pushed the United States out of the circle of "isolation," and the United States must participate in the international group that is threatened at all times, because the United States itself is also under enormous pressure and future disasters due to this international threat. Germany, Italy, and Japan are not only oppressing China, Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries, but also directly and indirectly damaging the interests of the United States, and are even actively attacking the United States. The more these democratic countries are oppressed, the more dangerous the United States becomes. Therefore, the active participation of the United States in the democratic front is also to defend its own interests. Bittman argued: "If democratic countries are not given the opportunity to defend themselves, what is the difference between helping aggressive countries?" The New York World-Telegram even stated: "...Selling one plane to Great Britain and France is ten times more effective than increasing the same number of U.S. Air Force after June. We must know that the security of the United States is not in the Atlantic, but in Great Britain and France." These are indeed insightful remarks. Secondly, selling military supplies to democratic countries is not only helping the allied countries in this front, but also increasing the huge profits of arms dealers, which will surely get the support of the backstage bosses of the country's government. Therefore, the "New York World-Telegram" took the lead in writing: "This is not only Great Britain and France being the front line for our country's defense, but also benefiting us with gold. We are very fortunate to do this business." It can be seen that the American public opinion supports President Roosevelt's foreign policy very actively. This policy has both the objective requirements of the world situation on the one hand, and the subjective support of the American people on the other. Its future is too bright to wait and see, and the opposition of the isolationists will eventually lead to misery.

The second significance of President Roosevelt's new foreign policy is its huge effect that will occur. This point can be analyzed from two aspects. The effect in Europe is not only to strengthen the power of Great Britain and France, but also to strengthen the power of the United States itself. President Roosevelt said: "The front line of the United States is in France, just as the front line of Great Britain is in the Rhine." The closeness of their relationship can be imagined. This move by the United States can not only protect Great Britain, France, and other countries, but also protect the United States itself. Because Germany and Italy, who are deliberately disrupting Europe, are not only oppressing Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries, but also preparing to attack the Americas. Japan, the aggressor in the East, with its occupation of China's territory and rights and interests, destroys the balance of power in the Pacific and wants to further threaten the Americas, which is also the result of the active support of Germany and Italy. In the Far East, if, as another message reports, "the U.S. General Staff is drafting a joint defense plan along the Pacific coast with Canada," then the U.S. national defense force in the Pacific will be greatly increased. President Roosevelt is already preparing to establish more naval bases in the Pacific. Its effect on determining the power to dominate the Pacific and preventing the rampant aggression of the Japanese aggressors has been analyzed in detail in previous articles. If the United States can further cooperate with Canada, it will not only gain military dominance in the Pacific due to the joint defense of the United States and Canada, but also increase further cooperation between Great Britain and the United States. There is another more important point about the possible effects in the Far East, which is to promote the practical cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union and to promote the active militarization of the Soviet Union. There are two reasons why the Soviet Union has not been able to actively launch military operations. That is, the democratic front has not yet been fully formed and the constraints of Germany and Italy in Europe. Now, the United States' support for the military of Great Britain and France is equivalent to actively participating in the democratic front, and at the same time, it is also curbing the arrogance of Germany and Italy and reducing the constraints suffered by the Soviet Union. If the League of Nations can resolutely implement the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant because of the United States' support for Great Britain and France, then the Soviet Union's military operations can not only be justified, but also have no worries, and it can defeat the aggressor's camp in one fell swoop. This is the reason why the Berlin newspapers attach importance to President Roosevelt's policy, and even the Berlin Evening News emphasized: "...Washington has become the center of the anti-dictatorial national movement." A Berlin local newspaper said, "Washington and Moscow are connected on the same line."

Finally, what we want to add is that the development of world politics is increasingly promoting the clarification of the boundaries between the democratic front and the aggressive front, so that every country knows what to do with its friends and enemies. We hope that those who guide the war of resistance or participate in the struggle will give more consideration and reflection to President Roosevelt's new foreign policy!

### Disaster Situation in Boluo

— Rou Zhi

[Special Report] Boluo County has been occupied by Japanese troops for two months. Countless villages throughout the county have been ravaged, and even now, one corner of the fourth district near Shilong is still occupied. Before I came to Boluo, I had heard that the disaster situation in Boluo was the most serious among the counties in the Dongjiang area. Now that I have arrived in Boluo, I have seen countless refugees who are more miserable than those I saw in the New Territories of Hong Kong. Everywhere I look, I see broken walls and ruins. I already know a glimpse of the severity of the disaster in Boluo. Who knows that the results of the investigation are even more shocking! The details are described below:

Boluo County is divided into four districts. Let's talk about the county seat first. There are at least several hundred shops and houses that have been bombed and burned to the ground, and I don't know how many are half-standing and half-remaining. There are almost no complete ones; one thousand five or six hundred people have been shot and burned to death, and more than one hundred people have died unexpectedly of illness during the evacuation period. In addition, in the first district, there are rows of houses in Hengtian that were burned, and more than a dozen people were killed; in Jiangdong Township, fifty or sixty houses were burned; in Shuixi Township, dozens of houses were also burned. In the second district—Taiwei Township, all 160 or 170 shops in the market were burned, and several people were killed; in Qinvxiang Township, more than 20 shops in the market were burned, and 200 or so houses in the village were burned, and two people were killed; in Zhonglu Township, more than 30 houses were burned, and more than a dozen people were killed; in Lian'an Township, more than 300 houses were burned, and more than 20 people were killed; in Tutu Township, more than 30 houses were burned, and around Gongzhuang, four or five people were killed. In the third district—Xiangshui City, only one of the 120 or 130 shops in the whole market remained, and three or four people were killed; in Baitang City, more than 30 shops were bombed, and 22 people died; in Lian'an Township, the most houses were burned in Xinzhaotang and Gugang, about 1,500 houses. In the fourth district—Tian Township, all 90 or so shops in the whole market were burned, and more than 120 people were killed; in Changning, all 50 or so shops in the whole market were burned, and in Guoshi Township, all 80 or so shops in the whole market were also burned—readers, do you find these numbers headache-inducing? If you let yourself imagine the true content of these numbers, can you stop at a headache?

The dead are gone—what about the living? So many shops and houses have been bombed and burned. How many people will be homeless? It's really unbearable to think about—those whose houses were not destroyed, their rice and livestock were eaten by the [Japanese] soldiers during their difficult times. The utensils and supplies were looted by bandits. Even if they still have a home, they don't know how they will be able to survive, so, in the whole of Boluo County, the disaster is extremely serious. There are at least 50,000 refugees who urgently need relief—not counting those who can barely find ways to support themselves. According to reports from people sent by the county government to investigate: In the whole of Fucheng Township, only a few families can barely make a living, and all others are in urgent need of relief; there are many other townships that are almost the same. It's almost unbelievable to say it, but if you go and see it for yourself, you can't help but believe it!

Would you also like to know something about their situation when they fled? Let me retell the words of a few refugee women (their words are all mixed together, and I can't tell which sentences were said by whom)—

"Before dawn, at five o'clock in the morning, we got up early and quickly cooked and ate. Carrying sons and daughters, we also had to carry things, desperately running to the side of the mountain stream. We didn't dare to cook for the whole day, for fear that the smoke would be seen by the [Japanese] planes. We were very hungry, and the children couldn't bear it and cried loudly for food. But the [Japanese] planes were always flying overhead, and we were afraid that the [Japanese] would hear them, so we forbade the children to cry. Others were afraid of being implicated, and interfered even more severely. The parents had no choice but to cover the children's mouths. Some used too much force, causing the children to be unable to breathe, and they died in an instant—it was ineffective to cover the mouths of children who were too young, and they still cried. Some parents became angry and grabbed their necks with force, and many were strangled to death like this. The [Japanese] set fire to the mountains, and the fire was approaching our bodies. Everyone scrambled to escape for their lives. At that time, people stepped on people. I don't know how many old people and young children were trampled to death—some people with more children couldn't bring so many children because they had to run fast to escape, so they abandoned a few. No one paid attention to them, and they either starved to death or froze to death—hungry during the day and cold at night, with so many mosquitoes, they would get sick even if they didn't die—we used to think that thirst was a trivial matter, but we only realized at that time that thirst was as important and as unbearable as hunger. In some places, we couldn't find a drop of water, and everyone was dying of thirst. There was a girl of eight or nine years old who begged for water very urgently. Her mother used her hand to press her down on her lap, scaring her and saying that the [Japanese] planes were coming. She didn't expect to use too much force, and she pressed her down for too long. By the time she let go of her hand, her daughter had died! Fortunately, it didn't rain. If there had been heavy rain, and our clothes had gotten wet, and we couldn't sleep on the ground, even more people would have died of illness. After a few days of fleeing, many men disappeared. They often left their wives and children to go elsewhere to find a way. Because there were no men to protect them, it was easier for bandits to strike. Even the seven coins that a woman had were taken away, and of course she couldn't keep her earrings. Even tattered quilts were wanted by the bandits—some women's coats and pants were relatively new and clean, and they were forced to take them off, leaving only their underwear! There were a mother and three children who were so hungry that they couldn't bear it. The mother couldn't bear to see her children starve to death, so she sold the youngest one for three dou of rice!" The old woman who reported this incident shed a few tears when she got to this point. She continued, "What's even worse is that the three dou of rice that she got in exchange were robbed by bandits the next morning!"

Now let's talk about the recent situation of providing relief to the refugees in Boluo:

After the [Japanese] soldiers withdrew from Boluo, the refugees gradually returned to their old homes. At this time, the most urgent and serious problem was the problem of food. Many refugees didn't have a single grain of rice left in their homes. The Relief Committee of the Overseas Chinese Huiyang Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong knew the severity of the disaster in Boluo and quickly came to Boluo City to set up a relief station. They sent Zeng Tianxi as the director of the relief office. There were a total of four or five men and women working together. They were very serious about their work. At first, they provided meals, but later it was too troublesome to cook, there were too many people, and it took too long. The refugees who came from afar couldn't bear to wait, so they changed to distributing rice, about six taels per person, and they took the relief coupons to collect it. They have been providing relief for more than a month, and there were as many as four or five thousand refugees coming to collect rice at the most. People who were too far from the city couldn't receive it, so they plan to extend the relief to the countryside next week, which is indeed necessary. In addition, the county government allocated a portion of the public relief funds issued by the provincial government and provided porridge once every morning. There were fewer people who came to eat porridge than to collect rice, but there were at least 200 people at the least and 500 people at the most. Such relief is not yet widespread, and the original relief funds are about to be used up. I hope that overseas Chinese will donate more money and rice and continue to provide assistance!

The second is the problem of clothing. Most of the refugees have very few clothes to wear, and the same is true for children. When the weather turns cold, you can often see them shivering, which is very pitiful. I heard that overseas Chinese groups in Hong Kong have donated several thousand cotton clothes and small children's sanitary clothes, etc., which will arrive soon. But there are tens of thousands of refugees, and these several thousand pieces are not enough to solve the problem. I hope that overseas Chinese will continue to donate!

The provincial government issued a portion of the public relief funds to provide porridge, a portion to provide work as relief, and most of it was to distribute cash to the refugees. They first investigated and registered, and then issued coupons, asking them to collect the money with the coupons. Because there was little money and many people, each person got very limited. In Fucheng Township, each person got only four cents and four mills of small silver coins. Some people waited for a day or two before they got this little bit of money. I feel very sad for them. Boluo, which has suffered a disaster, of course, it is difficult to raise money in the county to relieve the refugees, so we can only appeal to our compatriots who have not suffered a disaster in other places!

There is also a very big crisis, which is the problem of refugees' diseases. During the period of fleeing, they couldn't eat enough, didn't get enough sleep, had irregular lives, poor water quality, and mosquitoes were rampant. There were a lot of sick people, especially the old, weak, women, and children. The Shao Xun Overseas Chinese Rescue Team and the Dongjiang Rescue Team of the Huiqiao Rescue Association came to the county seat to diagnose and treat patients, provide rescue, and donate medicine. They stayed for a few days and left. They went to the countryside, and after they left, there was no one to treat the sick. Very few people were cured. When I came here this time, I was accompanied by a comrade from the Boluo Refugee Relief Association and brought three boxes of medicines, but unfortunately they were detained by the Shayu Chong Customs. I don't know how many lives have been delayed. We feel very sad. Here, at present, there is nothing more important than medicine. Even if those three boxes were shipped, it would still not be enough!

In the process of this relief work, the above-mentioned Hong Kong Huiyang Chamber of Commerce, Myanmar Overseas Chinese Rescue Team, Huiqiao Rescue Association Dongjiang Rescue Team, and the county's Relief Committee, Refugee Relief Association, etc., have all made great efforts and demonstrated considerable achievements, which is worthy of praise.

What is especially worthy of praise is: the comrades of the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Pioneer Team and the Boluo Wartime Work Team. The comrades of the Boluo Wartime Work Team went to the countryside in part and stayed in the city in part. They participated in the work of providing porridge and distributing rice every day, as well as distributing money these two days, and did not spare their efforts.

The comrades of the "Anti-Japanese Pioneer Team" recently came to Boluo from Huiyang. They have only been working for a few days, but they have shown their excellence and enthusiasm everywhere. In the past, the order was not very good when providing meals and distributing rice. After they arrived, they guided the refugees to sit in a fixed position and led them to collect rice in an orderly manner after the rice arrived, and then they withdrew in an orderly manner. The place where the rice was distributed in the past was very dirty. After they arrived, they swept all the houses clean and set up benches (there were many student benches there because it was the First Elementary School), so that the refugees would not feel embarrassed there. At the same time, they also preached to the refugees, and their attitude was very good, so that the refugees were very willing to approach them and were willing to accept their opinions. They plan to go to the countryside to serve in two days. I will travel with them, and perhaps there will be new things to see and hear, and I will report it then. (End)

### Guangdong's War Situation Becomes Tense Again. Our Army Actively Deploys. The Remaining Troops of the Dongjiang Area Have Been Transferred to the Beijiang Area. Wu Qiwu's Troops Have Arrived in Eastern Guangdong

[Dongjiang Fast News from the Enlightenment Society] In the northwest and southern parts of Guangdong Province, the violent [Japanese army], are stirring and attempting to find out the strength of our side and take the opportunity to attack the Guizhou Province. Therefore, the military authorities in South China are also stepping up their deployments for resisting [Japanese] aggression and war of resistance. In addition to equipping strong troops on each line to form a strong line of defense to frustrate the [Japanese army], they are now also preparing to launch a major counter-offensive by our troops in the East to break through the outer defenses of the [Japanese army] in the Dongjiang area and shake the [Japanese] position in Guangzhou in order to contain the [Japanese army] from developing in various directions in the northwest and south and crush the [Japanese army]'s conspiracy to invade Guizhou. The following is an exploration of the Dongjiang war situation.

The [Japanese army] in Zengcheng is Preparing to Retreat to Guangzhou

The [Japanese] army, under the command of Wu Qiwu, the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route, which is entrenched in Taiping, Zengcheng, and Shilong in Dongguan, has long been surrounded and controlled by our army and guerrilla teams in various districts. The reason why it has not been driven out in one fell swoop for a long time is to comply with the established strategy of the highest military authorities to trap and consume the [Japanese army]. Now that the [Japanese] army in Guangzhou is plotting to move westward to Guizhou Province, it is believed that the time to annihilate the [Japanese army] has come. Therefore, orders have been issued to the military teams stationed on the entire line of Huizhou, Boluo, Dongguan, Zengcheng, and Shi[long] to launch a large-scale guerrilla annihilation war immediately. At the same time, orders have been issued to the troops attacking Zengcheng and guerrilla teams to step up their encirclement and suppression of the remaining [Japanese army], annihilate them as soon as possible, and take advantage of the victory to attack Guangzhou. It has been found that there are about 2,000 [Japanese army] troops in Zengcheng. In recent days, the [Japanese army] has been very frightened by our army's active preparations for a major counter-offensive. Knowing that its strength is weak and it will be difficult to resist stubbornly, it is now preparing to retreat when necessary. According to [information], the [Japanese army] in Guangzhou has recently sent a large number of engineering teams to build fortifications and fortresses in the suburbs of Nangang, Fuhe, Longyandong, Xiaoping, Baiyun Mountain, and Shijing. The situation is very embarrassing. Judging from its intentions, it seems that if the front line is lost, it will retreat to Guangzhou to resist stubbornly.

Commander-in-Chief Wu Inspects the Front Line

It has also been found that Wu Qiwu, the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route, has decided on a plan to counter-attack Guangzhou since he led his troops to Guangdong some time ago. Commander-in-Chief Wu is also inspecting the front line defense and instructing the military on the essentials of offense and defense. He departed from a certain place in Dongjiang on the 20th of last month to inspect Heyuan, Hailufeng, Huiyang, Boluo, Xinfeng, and once went to Luofu Mountain to inspect a new mechanized division. Those who accompanied him included Zhen, the fourth army, and many senior staff chiefs. He has recently completed the inspection and reported to Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui about the arrival of his troops in Guangdong and consulted on all matters of the War of Resistance. He took the Dongjiang route to Shaoguan the day before yesterday to pay a visit to Commander Zhang to request instructions on various matters.

Reorganization of Military Affairs in Dongjiang

It has also been found that Zhang Fakui, the commander-in-chief, has designated Wu Qiwu, the commander of the 9th Army Group, who has led his troops to eastern Guangdong and has been appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route, to be in charge of the military affairs of the Dongjiang counter-offensive. In order to adjust the military affairs of the front line and re-divide the tasks of the War of Resistance, it has been designated that the Mo Zhen, Zhang Deneng, Chen Rongji, Li Hanhun, Chen Gongxia, Wang Dequan, Ye Zhao, Tan, Hua Zhenzhong and other troops who accompanied Commander Wu to Guangdong this time will be under the command and control of the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Route to take charge of the counter-offensive against Dongjiang. The two divisions of Huang Tao and Zhang Ruigui, and the two brigades of Xian Wenshu, Hai Liangcai and Lin, which were originally fighting there under the 12th Army Group, will be ordered to be transferred to Beijiang and will still be under the control of Yu Hanmou, the commander-in-chief of the 12th Army Group and commander-in-chief of the Northern Route, to take charge of the military affairs of the Northern Route counter-offensive.

### The Situation of Guangdong Yarn Becomes Tense Again. The [Japanese] Chemical Troops Open Sanshui. [Japanese] Warships Harass the Coastal Ports

[Central News Agency Lian County, 1st] A new [Japanese] chemical troops of two companies have been transferred from Taiwan to Guangdong, carrying dozens of tons of poisonous gas, which will be used in the Sanshui estuary.

[Central News Agency Wuzhou, 1st] On the 29th, the [Japanese] warships sent motorboats to explore the water situation on the Maoming sea, and landed a small number of infantry from Meilu in an attempt to test our defensive strength. Our defending soldiers calmly resisted the war. Knowing that we were prepared, the [Japanese troops] retreated immediately.

[Macau Foreign Telegram, 2nd] Several [Japanese] warships approached Beihai yesterday morning and bombarded it fiercely. Many shells fell into the water, destroying countless civilian ships, and many houses along the coast were also burned down. Under the cover of artillery fire, the [Japanese] marines attempted to land, but were repelled by us.

[Reuters Chongqing, 2nd] Regarding the report of the Japanese army landing at Anpu on the 28th of last month, this question has already been denied, and the Southwest Military Office of the Chairman has also issued a denial statement.

[This newspaper Shanghai, 2nd Special Telegram] Foreign news, the Japanese naval and land military authorities in China have agreed that the navy will be stationed in cities in the Yangtze River basin, from Shanghai to Yuezhou, about 700 miles, while the army will carry out the movement of clearing up the Chinese guerrillas in the occupied areas. It is reported that the Japanese army is now building several military bases. Foreign observers said that the Japanese army is stocking up with military supplies and various materials in Nanjing, Wuhu, and Hankou for application. It is also reported that the Japanese army plans to clear up the Chinese plainclothes teams operating in the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei. Although there are a large number of Japanese troops in the area, they can only exercise actual control over some land close to railways and rivers.

[Reuters Chongqing, 2nd] Yesterday, a Chinese military spokesman said that the strength of the Japanese army in the Northwest, Central China, and Huafu is now insufficient to carry out large-scale attacks. If the Japanese army wants to attack the Chinese military positions, it still needs reinforcements.

[Central News Agency Guilin, 1st] On the 29th, the [Japanese] troops on the north bank of the Xiuhe River continuously bombarded the south bank with artillery fire. More than 400 [Japanese] shells were fired near our Zhangjiapu, and part of the position was destroyed.

Fierce Battles in Liaoxian, Eastern Jin

[Central News Agency Xi'an, 1st] Military news, the [Japanese army] of Heshun invaded Liaoxian in three routes. Our army intercepted them along the way, and the [Japanese army] suffered heavy losses. A large number of bullets, shells, and food were seized. Later, the [Japanese army] continued to increase its forces and attacked Liaoxian in three routes at dawn on the 30th. A fierce battle broke out with our troops. Because we were attacked on three sides, we gave up Liaoxian immediately. The [Japanese army] continued to invade the south with more than a thousand people. It has now reached Lianggu Village and is fighting with a part of our [Japanese] Division. Another part of us is still confronting the [Japanese army] near Liaoxian City.

[Associated Press Chongqing, 2nd] According to reliable military sources here, General Ma Zhanshan will soon be able to reach outside the Guan and continue to lead a large army to fight the Japanese. It is reported that General Ma's Vanguard Army is an extremely excellent Northeast cavalry, and the members are currently fighting the Japanese army in western Sui, making great achievements and winning victories, and have arrived at the border of "Manchuria".

### Yantai Chinese and Foreign Merchants Suffer from X Party's Oppression; Export Permits Cannot Be Obtained; Commercial Vessels Often Depart Empty

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd] The puppet government of Beiping has decided to apply the Qingdao method of restricting foreign exchange for exports to Weihaiwei and Yantai. The main reason is to maintain the value of the banknotes of the puppet "Federal Reserve Bank of Beiping." All foreign exporters must purchase foreign exchange from the Yokohama Specie Bank at a higher exchange rate. According to the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy, Japanese, Chinese, and foreign exporters are treated equally. It is heard that two British commercial vessels departed from Yantai for Shanghai without any cargo because the local authorities refused to issue export permits. This is because foreign exporters refused to purchase foreign exchange from Japanese banks. It is also known that this restriction is only implemented in Qingdao, Weihaiwei, and Yantai. Tianjin, the largest port in North China, is not included in this regulation. It is expected that the port has foreign concessions and foreign banks, so trade is naturally more free.

[Haitong News Agency, Shanghai, 3rd] Regarding the incident of a Japanese warship intercepting a British vessel and two Norwegian vessels, a Japanese military spokesperson said that the British vessel "Paul" did not stop when it was stopped by a customs anti-smuggling vessel, and immediately sailed out of territorial waters. The spokesperson believed that this interception method was legal and stated that the Japanese military did not directly participate in the matter. He also denied the British captain's report that the Japanese warship escorted the vessel to Qingdao, stating that this was just a coincidence because the Japanese warship was also ordered to Qingdao at the same time.

### Sha Qianli and Others Form Cultural Guerrilla Force; Cultural Work Committee Active in the Fifth War Zone

[Special dispatch from our Shanghai newspaper, 2nd] According to news from cultural circles in this city, cultural figures who have moved to the interior have formed a Cultural Work Committee in the Fifth War Zone, led by Qian Junrui and Sha Qianli, to organize cultural guerrilla forces and send them deep into the guerrilla areas, as the second phase of the War of Resistance focuses on guerrilla warfare.

### Suzhou Farmers Righteously Resist Puppet Regime; Over 300 People Arrested; Traitors Falsely Accuse Them of Being Communists

[Special dispatch from our Shanghai newspaper, 2nd] The puppet organization in Suzhou is levying land taxes, but since Li Chaoyuan, the puppet district head of Nanbeiqiao, was shot by guerrillas, farmers in the surrounding villages have been hesitant to pay taxes. Peng Gusun even requested the puppet army to go to the villages to protect the tax collectors. The Xietang Township Tax Collection Bureau near the Kuatang Railway Station also requested the assistance of the puppet provincial police team to collect taxes as usual. At that time, the Bao head, Zhang Boquan, gathered two to three hundred farmers to surround the puppet police team and resist. The puppet provincial police team, relying on their superior weapons, opened fire, killing six farmers on the spot. Zhang Boquan, Jin Xiumen, Shen Jinshi, and others were arrested and taken to the Second Pacification Command of the puppet regime. After being interrogated and falsely accused of being communists, they were brutally murdered. Furthermore, more than 30 silk merchants were arrested outside the gate and imprisoned in the puppet police station, where they were subjected to severe torture. Under this tyrannical and cruel government, the people of Suzhou's four wings will have no way to survive.

### Tongji University to Resume Classes in Yunnan in March

### Losing the Battle and the Wife; X Widows Mobilized; Government to Register and Send Them to Our Country for Remarriage

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 2nd] According to reports from here, the Japanese government is currently recruiting a large number of widows to send to China and "Manchukuo" to marry Chinese men. The previous husbands of these widows were soldiers who died on the battlefields of China. The Japanese government also stated that the purpose of this move is to assimilate them with their future Chinese husbands, making them "pro-Japanese elements" and producing pro-Japanese children. Currently, 60,000 eligible widows have registered.

### New French Ambassador to China, Cosme, Has Departed for China; Belgian Embassy Counselor Flies from Yunnan to Chongqing

[Special dispatch from our Kunming newspaper, 2nd] The newly appointed French Ambassador, Cosme, has departed for China and will arrive in Chongqing via Yunnan in the near future.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 1st] The counselor of the Belgian Embassy in China, Mr. Xu Qiwu, and his wife arrived here by plane from Kunming today.

### Yu Hanmou Discusses Guangdong Province's Troop Source Problem; Military District Affairs Have Been Transferred to the Provincial Government; Conscription Will Surely Be More Effective in the Future

[Shaoguan Correspondence from the Min Ge News Agency] This reporter recently accompanied a political work brigade to inspect the front line. On the way back in ××, it happened that Yu Hanmou, Deputy Commander of the Fourth War Zone, and his staff members were also returning from inspecting the defenses on the front line. As the general counter-offensive in the South China War is about to begin, the issues of troop adjustments, troop replenishment, and the cooperation between guerrillas and regular troops are of great importance to the long-term War of Resistance. Therefore, I asked a staff member to introduce me to Mr. Yu and inquired about the recent facilities of the Guangdong Military District and the Self-Defense Corps Management Office, which are responsible for handling this task. Mr. Yu received me in the dim light and answered the reporter's questions as follows:

He said, "The people of Guangdong Province have always been rich in revolutionary spirit and extremely brave in combat. Since August 13th, many troops from this province have been transferred, and the number of soldiers replenished has been very large. Due to the lack of a perfect household registration system, conscription is quite difficult. However, while I concurrently served as the commander of the military district, I strictly supervised the conscription personnel. Selections and conscriptions must be carried out in accordance with legal procedures. Those who deviate from the norms will be strictly investigated. Over the past year, a large number of new recruits have been replenished, and fortunately, the supply has been continuous without interruption, and social order has not been affected. This fully demonstrates the patriotism of the people of Guangdong, which is extremely strong. The future of the War of Resistance is promising. However, conscription is closely related to administration. If an astute and capable civil affairs official is responsible for handling it, it will surely be more effective. Now, the affairs of the Guangdong Military District have been ordered to be transferred to the provincial government, and Chairman Li is responsible for presiding over them. In the future, the system will be consistent with the ideal, and the replenishment of troops will surely have better results, and there will be no shortage. As for the organization and training of the self-defense corps in this province in recent years, it has a considerable foundation. Last August, a pacification conference was held, convening senior civil and military officials from the entire province, and it was decided to use the self-defense corps as the backbone of the wartime guerrilla forces. Plans have been made for the preparation and methods of guerrilla warfare. This time, they have assisted the national army in resisting × in various places, and their achievements have been widely recognized. Recently, such as the recapture of Huizhou, Huaxian, and Conghua, and the defense of the Xijiang South Road, our national army has greatly benefited from the self-defense corps. However, in my personal opinion, the arming of the people belongs to the scope of civil affairs and should be handled by the provincial civil affairs department, which will be more effective in the future. Therefore, it was decided at a recent meeting to transfer it to the provincial government, and Chairman Li is responsible for handling it. Chairman Li comes from the military and has excellent talent and knowledge. It is very appropriate for the self-defense corps to be under his leadership. It is hoped that in the future, when assisting the national army in combat, there will be even more outstanding results. Finally, Mr. Yu also said, "Whether a system or method is good or bad has no absoluteness. However, in order to move towards perfection, it all depends on the integrity and efforts of the responsible personnel themselves, and the guidance and criticism of good public opinion in society. Therefore, I hope that responsible personnel at all levels will make more efforts, and society will guide public opinion at any time," and so on.

### Kong Xiangxi Tells American Reporter: We Support the Nine-Power Treaty; Respond to British and American Protests Against Japan; Report that British Examination Group Going to Japan is Not True

[Special dispatch from our Shanghai newspaper, 2nd] According to a report from the United Press in New York, the agency's correspondent in Chongqing recently met with Executive Yuan President Kong Xiangxi. Mr. Kong stated in a speech that China is always ready to participate in a joint meeting of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty in order to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute and all pending issues in the Far East. Regarding the issue of repaying foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties, Mr. Kong said, "All foreign investments under the National Government are absolutely safe."

[Reuters, London, 1st] British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question that the government has not received any official notification from Japan regarding a request to amend the Nine-Power Treaty.

[Reuters, London, 1st] Reuters has learned that the rumor that former British Prime Minister Lord Baldwin will lead an examination group to Tokyo is unfounded. This rumor was apparently triggered by a suggestion made in a letter to The Times by General Kenny.

### Incident of Attacking Imperial Airways Plane; X Navy Still Trying to Conceal

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 2nd] A Japanese naval spokesman here declared that the Japanese side has notified the airlines with third-country rights in China to ensure that their planes do not fly within a 50-mile radius of Weizhou Island and that the flight altitude in other areas must be maintained above 5,000 meters to avoid the unfortunate events of past misidentification. The spokesman also stated that the Japanese occupation of Weizhou Island is solely for the purpose of preventing the Chinese side from using civilian ships to smuggle military supplies, and therefore it is only a temporary strategic occupation.

### Life Protection for People Bombed; Life Insurance Department of the Central Trust Bureau to Implement Measures Soon

[Special dispatch from our Chongqing newspaper, 2nd] The Life Insurance Department of the Central Trust Bureau is drafting measures to protect the lives of people bombed during the emergency period, which will be implemented soon.

### X Planes Attack Shaoguan; Over 700 Civilian Casualties

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 2nd] It is reported that Shaoguan has been subjected to air raids by X planes 31 times in the past month, with 994 bombs dropped, resulting in more than 700 civilian casualties and the destruction of more than 730 houses.

### X Party's Investment in the Four Northeastern Provinces Increases Sharply

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 1st] According to a report from the "Manchurian Affairs Bureau," Japanese investment in "Manchukuo" last year totaled approximately 440 million yen, an increase of 100 million yen compared to 1937.

### Ye Chucang, Minister of Propaganda, Assumes Office

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] The newly appointed Minister of Propaganda, Ye Chucang, arrived at the ministry yesterday morning and addressed all the staff at 10:00 a.m., giving detailed instructions on future work.

[Associated Press, Chongqing, 2nd] It is rumored that the National Government will make some important personnel changes after the Fifth Plenary Session. The current Minister of Economic Affairs, Weng Wenhao, will be transferred to Minister of Education, and the Chairman of Guizhou Province, Wu Dingchang, will be transferred to Minister of Economic Affairs. However, this statement is currently unreliable.

### X Party Arrogantly Orders Foreigners to Leave Kuling

[Reuters, Shanghai, 2nd] Japanese officials here today notified the consulates of various countries, asking them to inform their nationals residing in Kuling that they must evacuate before the 10th. After that date, they will not be responsible for ensuring their safety. It is reported that there are currently 37 British, 12 American, 9 German, and 7 people of other nationalities still staying in Kuling.

### Wu Peifu's Speech Was Entirely Fabricated by the X Party; Aimed at Deceiving Chinese and Foreign People

[Reuters, Chongqing, 2nd] A Chinese military spokesman declared yesterday at a press conference that "General Wu Peifu will only have hope of coming out of retirement if the Japanese side agrees to restore China's administrative integrity. General Wu Peifu's speech was entirely fabricated by the Japanese side." Chinese newspapers here this morning prominently published various reports about the Japanese side's fabrication of Wu Peifu's speech. Chinese people do not believe that Wu has lost his integrity, because Wu has never considered becoming a puppet of the Japanese side. The Japanese side's repeated propaganda is nothing more than deceiving Chinese and foreign people.

[Reuters, Beiping, 1st] Although newspapers here under Japanese control claim that Wu Peifu's recent speech indicated acceptance of Japanese demands and that he would come out to rally people, Wu's confidants said that Wu himself was extremely angry about this interpretation, saying that he had not accepted Japanese demands and had never demanded that the Japanese army must first withdraw from certain places in order for him to truly command. Some people said that Wu had never made any accusations against the Chongqing central government, but had expressed opposition to the Communist Party. Therefore, the Japanese government's attempt to use Wu to carry out a "peace" movement has not yet achieved success.

[Associated Press, Xth Day, 2nd Month] Sources close to Wu Peifu himself claim that Mr. Wu Peifu has rejected Japanese demands and is unwilling to accept the position of "Chairman of the Pacification Committee." Mr. Wu has also set three conditions: first, that Japanese troops withdraw; second, that occupied areas be returned to China, including "Manchukuo"; and third, that Japan respects China's democratic system and diplomacy.

[Central News Agency, Canqing, 2nd] Because X has been unsuccessful in its long-distance expedition, it has recently issued telegrams in the name of our people's organizations and famous figures in opposition, calling for peace. Looking at their intentions, they are trying to divide our strength in the War of Resistance. The people of North China have seen through their tricks and recently sent a telegram to the whole country, denouncing their schemes. The original telegram is as follows: All agencies, newspapers, and broadcasts to compatriots across the country are hereby notified. X has been unsuccessful in its long-term war, and its military and financial resources are becoming increasingly exhausted. Its diplomacy is also isolated. Out of desperation, it is eager to seek peace. Knowing that our government is firm and its treacherous schemes are not succeeding, it has recently issued telegrams for peace in the name of various people's organizations or famous figures in opposition, such as Wu Peifu, with language that is more moderate than before. However, X's military deployment is still relentless. It can be seen that X's purpose is to use peace as a lure, and it wants to divide our front line so that after we are disintegrated and discouraged, it can be slaughtered at will. Its tricks are extremely vicious, and there is no greater than this. We must see through X's schemes and persist in the War of Resistance to the end in order to achieve final victory. No matter how difficult, this aspiration will not change. Thirty-three groups of people in North China respectfully request.

### Mr. Hu Yuzhi Speaks: The Current Situation of the War of Resistance (Continued from Yesterday)

— Notes from our reporter

——At the Hong Kong YWCA the day before yesterday——

In the second phase of the War of Resistance, there is also a clear manifestation of progress in the political sphere. Politics is more important than military affairs, which is also a new national policy determined at the Hengshan Conference. Political improvement is indeed more important than military improvement.

Now, let's talk about the current political situation in four points:

First, in terms of spiritual strength

Accepting the blood-like lessons, our political and spiritual mobilization has been further strengthened, so that soldiers at the front and the people in the rear receive full spiritual training. Therefore, the government recently trained 50,000 young cadres to be assigned to various inland areas to engage in publicizing to the masses, training the masses, and organizing the work of the masses. To match the development of the new situation, at present, not only is the sentiment of common hatred for the enemy increasing, but those who doubt the War of Resistance are either determined to stand up or are eliminated. As for the spiritual strength of the × people, it is much worse. The Japanese warlords have repeatedly claimed that the war can be ended and China defeated in the shortest possible time. However, again and again, it still has not been realized, only causing the Japanese to develop war-weary emotions from disappointment, and anti-war movements are constantly occurring. This is a definite fact, and the spirit of the Japanese invading soldiers is far worse than before.

Take the prisoners of war as an example! In the early days of the War of Resistance, it was very difficult for us to capture prisoners of war. When it was absolutely necessary, the × soldiers would rather commit suicide than surrender easily. However, the prisoners of war captured recently have been much more numerous. According to reports from North China: × troops often surrender and disarm to us as a whole team. Compared with our fighting more and more strongly, it is not known how much worse they are!

Our heroic soldiers often receive orders to retreat and disobey the orders, rushing to the front line again to shed blood and sacrifice. This spirit is truly moving! Chairman Chiang repeatedly instructed at the Hengshan Conference that it is appropriate to be brave; however, one should bravely obey the entire sacred task. One should advance when one should advance, and one should retreat when one should retreat. Do not be emotional and make unnecessary sacrifices. From this, we can know that our spiritual strength is superior to that of the × people, and we have the certainty of victory.

Second, in terms of material strength

In terms of materials, our country is also increasing every day, while the × people are decreasing every day. Our national currency and finance are very stable, but the × people's cash has been cleared. The price of securities is also plummeting. The × people's general mobilization law was originally intended to concentrate the national manpower and material resources to invade China, but this is only the attempt of the warlords, and it has been opposed by the people. From the × people's frugality in materials, we can also know the depth of their panic. Although we have lost many places along the coast, our capital and industry are developing towards the southwest and northwest. The government has also formulated economic construction plans for the southwest and northwest, which are being actively implemented. For example, the establishment of a province in Xikang, highways, and railways are all under active construction. If it were not for the War of Resistance, we do not know when we would have begun to pay attention to the construction of remote areas! Therefore, from the perspective of material strength, we also have the certainty of victory.

Third, in terms of internal unity

When Wang Jingwei was first expelled from the party, the × people took the opportunity to spread propaganda that we were internally divided. In fact, because of the elimination of the backward Wang faction, our internal unity has become more consolidated. The × people are either spreading rumors that the National Government will be communized or that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will split. In fact, the Communist Party has long sincerely expressed its support for the Three Principles of the People, the Supreme Leader, and the National Government. No matter how the × people try to sow discord, they can only see their efforts come to naught. We are truly becoming more and more united as we fight, while the × people, on the contrary, are becoming more and more contradictory and divisive. The fall of the Konoe Cabinet is a clear example. Therefore, internal unity is also where our country is superior to the × people, and we have the certainty of victory.

Fourth, in terms of the international situation

From the beginning of the War of Resistance, the democratic nations have sympathized with us. However, we believe that sympathy in words is not enough. Therefore, we earnestly hope that democratic nations can further sympathize with us and help us. In fact, as long as we can stand firm, we will definitely be able to get spiritual and material help from friendly countries. According to common sense: When a person has power and influence, it is easiest to win people's flattery and collusion; if he is in a poor situation, people will give him a cold shoulder and ignore him. The British and American loans were approved after the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan. Therefore, many people believe that this was unexpected. In fact, this is inevitable. We have the determination and ability to resist the war to the end, and it will surely make the help of friendly countries become more active.

This is an undeniable fact: When the demands of the fascist aggressors exceed the level that democratic countries can tolerate, democratic countries will definitely unite and become active.

A world war is not a matter of one, two, or three years, but may break out in one, two, or three months. We are not gloating and hoping for a world war to break out, but we are saying that we should seize the opportunity to stand firm in our own position, follow the teachings of the Premier and the guidelines of the War of Resistance and National Construction, clarify our diplomatic path, shatter the dreams of the German-Italian line, and join the peace front of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Give the aggressors a blow. (To be continued)

### Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee: Heated Questioning Battle; Debate Focuses on the China Issue; The Military Clique Cabinet Becomes the Target of Criticism

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Tokyo dispatch, 1st × The questioning battle in the House of Representatives Budget Committee entered a state of close combat again. The main points of the debate focused on: (1) increasing the number of cabinet members from political parties; (2) whether there are differences between the policies of former Foreign Minister Hirota, Army Minister Sugiyama, and current Foreign Minister Arita and Army Minister Itagaki; (3) whether to demand "reparations" from China; and (4) whether the interests of third countries in China should be respected.

Only Two Political Party Members

First, Seto, a member of the Seiyukai party, questioned that Prime Minister Hiranuma's previous speech stated that he respected the status of political parties. However, there are only two political party members in the current cabinet, which is not enough to show the current cabinet's respect for political parties. The number should be increased as soon as possible to achieve the practical effect of national unity. Hiranuma only replied that his cabinet was formed based on talent and did not ask whether they were members of a political party or not, but he would fully respect the status of political parties. It can be seen from this question and answer that the recent arrogance of political parties is slightly higher than before, and the politics of cooperation between military cliques and bureaucrats has obviously aroused dissatisfaction among the people. Therefore, it is worthy of attention that political parties seize the opportunity to make demands.

Putting on a Show, Empty Threats

Seto also asked whether it was true that the policies of the former and current foreign and army ministers were quite different. Hiranuma only replied from the side that there are no fixed and unchanging policies in the world. The implication is self-evident. Next, a certain member questioned whether third countries will be compensated for the damages suffered due to Japan's military operations in China. Arita replied that Japan may provide relief automatically, but has no intention of paying compensation. He strongly stated that a certain department of the cabinet recently advocated taking a more active attitude and declaring that a state of war already exists. Under military operations, the interests of third countries in China do not need to be considered. This is obviously a kind of intimidation to third countries. Those who heard it smiled it off.

Deceiving Oneself and Others, Demanding Reparations

Eto, a member of the Seiyu women's association, questioned why not demand "reparations" from China. Arita's reply was still self-deceiving. He also mentioned whether the four principles for resolving the war that he had proposed were still unchanged. Arita replied that Japan's fundamental policy towards China is fixed and unchanged. Although Konoe's December 22nd statement was different from previous statements, this was the result of environmental changes. However, Konoe's statement has not changed so far. This reply contains a lot of implications. Watanabe, a member of the Minseito party, questioned the security situation in North China. Itagaki replied that the military strength has recently been concentrated in (the occupied areas) to try to maintain the security of the area. One can imagine his embarrassing situation of being preoccupied with one thing and neglecting others.

Itagaki Reveals His Ambition Towards the Soviet Union

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Tokyo Foreign News, Army Minister Itagaki reported in the Diet Budget Committee today that since the Zhanggufeng Incident, the Soviet Union has been stepping up its military preparations in the Far East and actively increasing defenses on the border. Although there have been border crossings from time to time, this can only be regarded as accidental and has no international nature. There are no new incidents at present, but the Japanese side has made appropriate preparations to deal with incidents at any time.

Invasion War Against China Cannot be Stopped

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Tokyo Foreign News, Japanese Army Minister Itagaki said in the Diet that Japan has no intention of resolving the China Incident by means other than military force. The Japanese army's actions in China will continue unabated. He admitted that order has not yet been restored in the Japanese occupied areas.

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 2nd] The Japanese Foreign Minister said in the House of Representatives budget committee that he was unaware of the report regarding the visit of the British representative to Japan, but "it is possible and normal to exchange opinions with important figures from around the world." Army Minister Itagaki denied the rumors that the Japanese side will adopt methods other than force to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, saying that if the Chiang Kai-shek government does not abandon its anti-Japanese and pro-communist policies, the Japanese military action will never stop. Many Minseito party members asked what the gains of the Konoe statement were. Arita replied that anyone with a little insight, whether Chinese or foreign, should know that China's resistance to Japan is a very foolish thing. Part of the gains of the Konoe statement have already been manifested, and the rest will be seen soon.

Yonai Boasts of Hegemony in East Asia

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd] Tokyo Foreign News, Foreign Minister Arita said in the Diet today that it is a mistake for the general public to think that the aid given by Britain and the United States to the National Government is an economic oppression of Japan. Japan has no intention of blocking China's doors. A certain member of the Minseito party asked whether the Japanese navy's fuel would be sufficient in the event of an emergency in the Pacific. Navy Minister Yonai replied that the Japanese navy is fully prepared to deal with any situation.

### Roosevelt Consults with Military Commission on National Defense Plan; Pacific to be the Center of Defense; Germany Builds Fortifications in the Caroline Islands

[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] The national defense plan discussed by the Military Commission and President Roosevelt intends to use most of the $500 million budget for the plan to expand defenses in the Pacific region. Military observers said that although defenses in the Atlantic and Caribbean seas are extremely important, the Pacific will still be the center of American defense. Experts believe that the army and navy are currently developing defenses in the Atlantic and Caribbean seas through the following actions: (1) strengthening mobile air force and building important air force bases; (2) increasing the number of aircraft fields and aircraft manufacturing plants; and (3) stepping up the activities of seaplanes in the Panama Canal. Admirals Leahy and Hebert said that the United States must be prepared to defend against attacks by powerful navies. Naval experts explained that strengthening the defenses of Guam can limit the activities of invading countries' fleets in the Atlantic or Pacific.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] Assistant Secretary of the Army Colonel Johnson delivered a radio speech this evening, stating that a certain country at this time intends to control the world by force. The United States has no choice but to strengthen its military and prepare for self-defense. Some say that it is just a nightmare that one day the United States will be invaded, and it may not actually happen. However, what we thought were fantasies in the past have now become reality. How can we guarantee that what we think are fantasies today will not become reality? Our country is located on the shores of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, with very long coastlines, and has territories. We must have a powerful navy that is no less inferior to any other country. According to the Monroe Doctrine, we also bear heavy responsibilities in the Western Hemisphere, and we also need a strong military force.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] The House Naval Affairs Committee met today to discuss the replenishment of US naval bases. Republican Senator Mayes immediately declared that, according to the information he obtained, Germany is building defenses on one of the Caroline Islands in the Pacific with the consent of Japan. The Caroline Islands are located south of British Guam and originally belonged to Germany. After the European War, they were assigned to Japanese rule.

### American Policy Towards Europe: Britain Believes it Makes a Significant Contribution to the Balance of Power; France is Deeply Impressed, Germany Launches Fierce Attacks

[Associated Press, London, 1st] It is believed here that President Roosevelt's decision to provide war materials to Britain and France as much as possible is an important contribution to the redistribution of power in Europe. After the democratic countries of Britain and France obtain the assistance of the American arms industry, they can reduce the current superior military strength of Germany and Italy. British officials refused to comment on President Roosevelt's remarks before they were confirmed. The diplomatic community does not know whether Britain has signed a contract to purchase military fire from the United States, but it is believed that Britain and the United States have had detailed discussions on the issue of military fire. The British cabinet is currently discussing the issue of military fire and its relationship with the international situation.

[Reuters, Paris, 1st] The statement by President Roosevelt guaranteeing democratic countries is extremely impressive here. Although the statement does not interpret that the United States will send troops to Europe in the event of a conflict between totalitarian countries and the democratic countries of Britain and France, the strength of this statement has indeed exceeded the relationship between the United States and European democratic countries in the past.

[Reuters, Berlin, 1st] This evening, the newspapers in Berlin expressed their anger at President Roosevelt's report to the Senate Military Committee regarding the acceptance of military fire and the affairs of European democratic countries. The headlines of the newspapers included "American Defense on the Rhine" and "Roosevelt's Incredible Provocation." Political figures do not pay much attention to this report, saying that it is unofficial, and even saying that it is unconfirmed. However, German political figures believe that if the news of the secret meeting reported by American newspapers is true, then President Roosevelt's remarks are very strange, because they are tantamount to indicating that he will destroy Hitler's peace work and make Europe unable to obtain true peace. They told our reporter, "This kind of peace is necessary for American prosperity. We cannot help but think that the United States has made a mistake. This kind of war-like preparation is very noisy and nothing more than wanting to promote unfortunate events." The "Berlin Evening News" said that this kind of action is unprecedented since the Great War. "This proves that President Roosevelt is Wilson II and the United States has destroyed its neutral policy." The "Local Newspaper" said, "President Roosevelt has now shown his hope, that is, he wants to make Britain and France the pawns of Jewish American war policy."

[Reuters, Berlin, 2nd] This morning, the newspaper groups here unanimously and fiercely attacked President Roosevelt, calling Roosevelt a "war instigator and the leader of communism." The People's Observer said that Roosevelt "actually wants to overthrow the world into chaos in order to fish for the benefit of the Jews."

Isolationists Protest

[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] Many US senators requested President Roosevelt to clearly express the US policy towards Britain and France to the country. The senator from California said, "The basic question is whether we will move towards war and the people will never know about it." Senator Clark of Missouri declared, "I will investigate the situation stated by President Roosevelt. The manufacture of American fighter jets will be affected because aircraft must be supplied to France. I request that all records of the Military Committee be made public." Democratic leaders unanimously questioned why selling aircraft to democratic countries would involve the United States in the war. Senator Johnson said, "This is a secret question. A small origin may produce terrible results. We really have the right to know the path we are taking now."

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] A small group of senators opposing President Roosevelt's "aid to democratic countries" policy has now been formed and may be expanded. At the same time, the president's position in the constitution is also very stable, because the constitution stipulates that when the head of state exercises the power of foreign relations, the Senate's power of intervention is quite limited.

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] Members of the American Academy of Isolationist legislators protested today against President Roosevelt's secret convening of members of the Senate Military Committee yesterday, but other parties responded more favorably to the President's move. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman said, "To disallow democratic countries to prepare for self-defense is tantamount to assisting countries that implement intimidation." Senator Johnson issued a statement that could represent the opinion of the isolationists. He said that the American people should have the right to understand whether selling aircraft to Britain and France will lead the United States into war, and said that the president secretly informs the committee of events that involve not only the Senate but also the people of the whole country without informing others, which is easy to cause misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the facts. At the moment, there is a lot of speculation that Roosevelt's hints imply that the law prohibiting the transport of military fire and aircraft to belligerent countries may be abolished when the legislative bill is revised in mid-May this year. One commentator said that when the next world war breaks out, the United States will become "the largest supply station in the world's history. American large-scale manufacturing plants will manufacture aircraft, heavy artillery, tanks, food, and clothing at a rate that no other country can match." The countries that will benefit the most from such an amendment to the Neutrality Act will be Britain and France, because the United States

holds "cash and carry" and naturally chooses the front line with the largest navy, merchant ships, and gold reserves.

New York Newspaper Supports the Sale of Aircraft

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] The New York World Telegram commented on the sale of aircraft to Britain and France, saying, "The significance of this matter is that Britain and France pay us in cash, and we strengthen our most important and most threatened national defense outposts. We are very fortunate to have this transaction. In terms of national defense, our supply of an aircraft to Britain and France today is more effective than supplying the US Air Force half a year later. The most advanced outpost of American peace and security is not the Atlantic Ocean, but Britain and France. This is a very obvious matter." Isolationist senators Clark and Knee demanded in the Senate today that the Military Committee publish the records of the review of French aircraft purchases. Knee said that if the committee has such secret meetings again in the future, he will implement a boycott, saying that these meetings are "completely incompatible with the steps that democratic countries should take."

### Purchasing Aircraft from the US: France is This Year's Largest Customer; Last Year's Exports Valued at 70 Million

[Associated Press, Washington, 1st] According to the statistics of the Department of Commerce, France will be the largest customer for ordering aircraft from the US this year. France has already ordered 100 "Curtiss" military aircraft from the US, and the French air corps is also consulting with the US authorities to continue ordering 600 aircraft, valued at $35 million. Last year, the three countries of the Netherlands, Japan, and China purchased the most aircraft parts and aviation supplies from the US, totaling $68 million.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] According to statistics from the Department of Commerce, nearly half of the aircraft and aircraft materials manufactured in the United States in 1938 were exported abroad, with a total value of $68,000,000. Of these, 44 percent were transported to countries along the Pacific coast. By country, the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies were the largest customers, accounting for the first place, purchasing a total of $2,774,043. Japan ranked second, purchasing a total of $11,062,447. China ranked third, purchasing a total of $6,391,7213. The next ones are Argentina, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, Turkey, Brazil, Mexico, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the British Hong Kong Island. As far as the orders that various American aircraft have received in the current year are concerned, the countries of Europe are the largest customers. In addition, according to the statistics of the Department of Commerce, the number of waste steel exports from the United States last year was 1,381,901 tons for Japan, 309,319 tons for the United Kingdom, and 230,903 tons for Germany. Among them, the number purchased by Japan, Italy, and Germany increased compared to 1937, while the United Kingdom decreased.

### Hoover Speech: Attacks Roosevelt's Policies; Believes There is a Danger of Causing War

[Associated Press, Chicago, 2nd] Former President Hoover delivered a speech at the Municipal Council here last night, vehemently attacking President Roosevelt's foreign policy, saying that the President's policy has completely violated the Neutrality Act and there is a danger of causing war, because any country with a little strength will find it difficult to endure such oppression. Hoover warned the people of the country that anyone who thinks about economic sanctions should think about the danger of war. When referring to the danger of an invasion by totalitarian countries, Hoover dismissed it as absurd. He believes that neither Germany, Italy, Japan, nor the Soviet Union intends to interfere in the Western Hemisphere. President Roosevelt's policy has put the United States in a difficult position of having to specify who is the aggressor. This attitude of claiming the right of natural leadership is laughable. American policy has gradually moved towards active aggression, but if you want to be actively aggressive, you must first have the strength. Today, we seem to have the intention of breaking communist, Nazi, and fascist ideas, but ideas cannot be destroyed by battleships and aircraft. Hoover concluded that after the next world war, countries around the world may become dictatorships, and the United States will be difficult to avoid.

### Soviet Central Committee Proposes Abolishing Mass Purges; To Be Discussed at the Communist Party Congress; To Avoid Expelling Loyal Members

[Reuters, Moscow, 1st] The 18th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, to be held on March 10 this year, will propose the abolition of the "Mass Purge Case." The initiator of this proposal is Zhdanov of the Soviet Central Executive Committee. It is reported that he will report to the Congress at that time that past "mass purges from time to time" have not had any effect. The purges often expelled loyal members of the party for the crime of being "passive," while reactionary elements were still able to hide and exist. This proposal will be submitted to the party congress on the 10th of March for discussion and approval, which can be regarded as a sign of the restoration of normalcy within the Soviet Union. The case includes allowing party members to publicly criticize the highest party and government authorities, the secret trial system will be completely abolished and replaced by individual trials, so that those accused of violating party discipline can defend themselves. It is said that the movement against capitalist elements will be stopped, and the distinction between workers, intellectuals, and farmers will be abolished.

### Yu Bin Leaves France for the United States; Pleads for 30 Million Refugees; Claims Japan Cannot Conquer Our Country

[Central News Agency, Le Havre, France, 1st] Bishop Yu Bin of the Nanjing District of China, in the name of the commissioner of the Refugee Relief Committee, the chairman of the Catholic Relief Society, and the representative of various charitable organizations in Shanghai, expressed his gratitude for the relief efforts for Chinese refugees by the groups over the past two years. He went to Europe and visited Pope Pius XI in Rome, deeply obtaining the Pope's permission. At the same time, he was also encouraged by the French Idong Church Missionary Society. This afternoon, he took a mail ship to New York. He plans to stay in the United States for half a year on this trip, and then return to China. Before leaving, he also made the following remarks to a Havas News Agency reporter. The reporter asked, how long will the Sino-Japanese war last? Yu replied that, weighing Japan's strength, it may not be able to support the war for more than two years. If the country wants to control China, it must occupy all of China. It is absolutely impossible to seize only a few cities, because China is an agricultural country and its main lifeline is not in the cities. As far as the current situation is concerned, only the places where the Japanese army is stationed are occupied by it, and the rest are still in the hands of China. Asked how he thinks the Sino-Japanese war will end, he replied that Japan will never be able to end the war by force, and one day Japan will be the first to ask for peace. Asked if Europe were to have a war, would Japan come out to help Germany and Italy based on the Anti-Communist Pact, he replied that Japan cannot conquer China, how can it have the ability to participate in another war?

### British King Returns to London; Also Meets with Chamberlain

[Reuters, London, 1st] The British King returned here from Sandringham today and met with Prime Minister Chamberlain. This was the Prime Minister's first visit to the palace since Christmas.

### Colonial Issues: Britain Decides to Deal With It Cautiously; Gaida Discusses Italy's Mediterranean Policy Again; Takes Steps to Confront Britain and France

[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] According to local officials, the United Kingdom does not wish to discuss the issue of re-distribution of colonies raised by Germany unless there is a unanimous and perfect solution from all parties concerned. In other words, if Germany intends to use the colonies as a base for aggression, so that German air force and submarines can use this to threaten the interests of the British Empire, it should be refused discussion. As long as this motivation of Germany exists, the United Kingdom will not be willing to give the colonies to Germany. Prime Minister Chamberlain will never be willing to return Tanganyika (originally belonged to Germany and is now a British mandated territory) in East Africa to Germany, because the traffic from the Cape of Good Hope, the Red Sea, to India is based here. If Germany occupies this place, the route to India is subject to attack at any time.

[Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 1st] Gaida, a spokesperson for Mussolini, published an article in the "Strenth" of the German "Hitler Youth Corps" yesterday, explaining Italy's strategies in the Mediterranean. The article first emphasized that the Mediterranean is Italy's sea route and the oppressive policies adopted by France in the Mediterranean towards Germany and Italy, and then said, "France's imperialist ambitions are a crisis in Europe's future. As for Britain, it wants to encircle Italy and isolate Italy's supply. Italy has seen this and cannot but take counter-measures. The policy of the German-Italian axis is to enable Germany to develop towards Southeast Europe and to enable Italy to develop in the Mediterranean. Britain, France, and China have adopted oppressive policies towards Italy in the Mediterranean. During the Abyssinian War, Britain and France's policies reached a high degree, but the result of the war was not only that Italy increased its land, but also gained political victory in the Mediterranean. Under the rule of Chamberlain, Britain is adopting a policy of coordination on the one hand and expanding its military on the other. The scope of military expansion even includes the Mediterranean. After the Abyssinian War, Britain wanted to control the waterways of India, and there were two ways to pay attention to, (1) seeking waterways in Africa, and (2) concentrating its strength in the Mediterranean. According to the current situation, Britain is adopting the second way. Britain recognizes the Mediterranean as a base for observing the strength and actions of foreign countries and as a part of the island's colonial policy, so it has no choice but to maintain its colonies in Africa and not allow other countries to interfere. France's policy is also no different from Britain's. Today, Italy's policy is to resist the oppression of Britain and France."

[Central News Agency, Rome, 1st] Today, Ssorini, accompanied by German Advance Army Commander Lusian, reviewed the fascist army and the 20,000 people. Today is the 16th anniversary of the establishment of the civilian group. It was expected that Mussolini would deliver a speech on France and Italy, but he did not give a speech, which was unexpected.

### Britain Prepares to Convene a Four-Nation Round Table Conference; US Government Personnel Observe

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] US government officials said that the criticisms of Hitler and Chamberlain's recent speeches are relatively mild, so the European situation can be temporarily eased. It is believed here that Chamberlain has repeatedly advocated a European appeasement policy and that Britain has prepared to convene a round table conference of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy to resolve all county cases.

### Spanish Rebel Army Continues to Advance North

[Reuters, Burgos, 1st] The Spanish rebel army continued to advance north of Barcelona and has captured Todara. Military operations on other fronts have been greatly affected by the bad weather.

[Reuters, Paris, 1st] The French Foreign Affairs Committee refused the Communist Party's request to open the French-Spanish border so that weapons could be transported to the Spanish Republic.

### Palestine Conference: British Prime Minister to Personally Preside, Giving Individual Speeches to Each Delegation; Jewish Children Issue to be Discussed

[Reuters, London, 1st] Authoritative sources reveal that British Prime Minister Chamberlain will formally preside over the opening of the Palestine Conference on Tuesday morning next week. He will deliver speeches to each delegation individually, and receive responses from the leaders of each delegation. It is generally expected that substantive talks will begin two or three days after next Tuesday. Colonial Secretary MacDonald and Under-Secretary Butler will attend the majority of the meetings. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax will also attend several sessions. Colonial Secretary MacDonald met with several members of the Jewish Congress today, who will also participate in the Palestine Conference. These include Dr. Weizmann, Mr. Berligne, Professor Sirig, and Mr. Lurie. The first Jewish talks will be held on Wednesday, as they will not arrive from Palestine until Tuesday evening. MacDonald also met tonight with representatives from Egypt, Arab countries, and Iran. It is generally expected that speeches delivered at the conference will be in English, French, and Arabic.

[Reuters, London, 1st] During today's continued question time in the House of Commons, Conservative MP Adams first raised the question of the Colonial Office's refusal to allow 10,000 German Jewish children to enter Palestine. He suggested that restrictions on Jewish entry should be implemented gradually in the future. Colonial Secretary MacDonald replied that this issue of immigration restrictions will be discussed in the upcoming London talks, but the outcome is difficult to predict. However, the government will prioritize humanitarian considerations and strive to allow these children to enter Palestine.

### New Conflict on the Soviet-Manchukuo Border; Soviet Union Protests to Japanese Government, Warns of Serious Consequences

[Reuters, Eisk, 2nd] According to the Soviet TASS news agency, a new conflict has occurred on the Soviet-Manchukuo border. Five Soviet border guards near Krasdorfskaye were fired upon by 18 "Manchukuo" soldiers using machine guns and rifles. The "Manchukuo" soldiers were later repelled, and the Soviet commander sustained minor injuries. The Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Tokyo has received instructions from the government to protest to the Japanese government, stating that "Manchukuo" military incursions into Soviet territory are occurring frequently and warning that the Japanese side will be responsible for any serious consequences.

### Brief Commentary: Gospel

In the past few days, newspapers have been rapidly publishing several articles that have attracted worldwide attention, namely the speeches of German Führer Hitler and British Prime Minister Chamberlain, and the remarks of US President Roosevelt. This newspaper's brief commentaries over the past two days have clearly pointed out Hitler's speech's madness and intimidation, and Chamberlain's speech's empty words to conceal the disaster of war. Now, Roosevelt's remarks have also caused a huge reaction, that is, the cheers of the people of Britain and France, and the anger of Hitler's pro-government newspapers.

President Roosevelt, in a conversation with the Senate Military Affairs Committee on the 31st, stated that "in the event of any conflict in Europe, he will not hesitate to take any steps short of war to support democratic countries and confront dictatorships." This statement is noteworthy for at least three reasons: (1) It more clearly expresses that "peace is indivisible." If the United States wants to maintain democracy and peace, it must sanction fascist aggressors who are killing democracy and peace internationally. (2) It teaches and strengthens Britain and France, urging them to actively unite with the Soviet Union and the United States to resist fascist aggressors. (3) It also serves as a strong warning to fascist aggressors in the Far East, forcing them to consider the potential blow to their rear while invading the West and advancing South.

Therefore, we can say that Roosevelt's voice is a gospel for defending human freedom and world peace. It is entirely expected that this gospel will be cheered and supported by righteous and peace-loving people in Britain, France, and around the world, while arousing the resentment and anger of the aggressors Germany, Italy, and Japan.

It is especially noteworthy that President Roosevelt has not only made remarks, but is also striving to repeal the "Neutrality Act," to strengthen the anti-war capabilities of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and to unite the Soviet Union in aiding Britain and France. The French "Aviation Delegation" is also being warmly welcomed by the United States. Although leaders of compromising diplomacy in Britain and France may feel uncomfortable with this policy, will the vast majority of righteous people in Britain and France ultimately break through this discomfort?

### Hitler's Conspiracy Against Ukraine

— Foreign Affairs

Translated by Bao Ren from the January issue of the New York magazine

If we look at a map of Eastern Europe, we can see that between Germany and the Soviet Union are Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, and many other smaller countries. These small countries, bordering the Black Sea to the east and the Baltic Sea to the north, form a "zone of small countries." Due to their vast resources and rich agricultural products, these areas have aroused the covetousness of fascist aggressors. Currently, due to Chamberlain and Daladier's policy of appeasement, which deliberately concedes to aggressors, Hitler has been emboldened and fearlessly carries out aggression. After annexing Austria, he proceeded to partition Czechoslovakia. However, Hitler's aggressive ambitions are far from being satisfied, and Czechoslovakia's sacrifice will not fill his aggressive desires. His next target is still to take a posture of preparing to attack the Soviet Union, following the "Eastern Invasion" route to recover Memel, return it to Germany, win over Hungary, and establish the so-called "Independent Ukrainian State."

Ukraine is a province in western Soviet Union with a population of 35 million. In addition, there are 5 million Ukrainians living in southern Poland, and the Ruthenia autonomous region at the eastern end of Czechoslovakia is also entirely populated by Ukrainians. In these three Ukrainian-populated areas, there are rich coal, iron, and oil mines, and fertile wheat fields. At the end of the eighteenth century, more than one million Germans migrated to the steppes of the Russian Ukrainian province. Therefore, German ambitious people have been coveting Ukraine for a long time. In 1918, when the European War was about to end, Germany forced Russia to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, stipulating that Russia recognize Ukraine's independence, and also sent 400,000 German troops to garrison the area. Later, due to Germany's defeat, this dream became a fleeting shadow and disappeared. It was not until Hitler came to power and seized political power that he openly reiterated Germany's ambitions for Ukraine at the 1937 National Socialist Party Congress. Because Ukraine is vast and rich in resources, its land area is much larger than Germany itself. If Hitler can seize this piece of meat, the unemployment problem in Germany can be completely solved, and all unemployed workers and poor farmers' children without land can be transported there. At the same time, Ukraine is something Hitler is determined to obtain in the process of his conspiracy to attack the Soviet Union. We only need to pay close attention to the recent words and deeds of the leaders of the National Socialist Party to know that this assessment is correct.

Eastern European ethnic groups have always been very complex, and the residences of various ethnic groups and national boundaries have many complicated places. Therefore, the slogan of "national self-determination" is often used by aggressors as an excuse to change national borders. Hitler's swallowing of Austria and dismembering of Czechoslovakia used the slogan of "national self-determination" as a decorative term for aggression. Now that Ukrainians are living in Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia, Hitler can use this excuse to instigate Ukrainian independence. Recently, the National Socialist Party headquarters in Berlin has established a Ukrainian Bureau. Within the territory of Czechoslovakia under German hooves, the Ukrainian National Self-Government Association has been established, and the National Socialist Party's organ is published there to promote National Socialism. At the same time, the leader of the Belarusian Restoration Party, Silovitz, also personally went to Berlin to discuss the Ukrainian independence movement with Hitler. As for the base from which they began their activities, it is the Ruthenia autonomous region at the eastern end of Czechoslovakia.

The reason why Hitler extremely opposed Poland and Hungary's demands to divide the Ruthenia region and advocated the establishment of an autonomous region in Ruthenia is, on the one hand, to split the unity between Poland and Hungary, but on the other hand, it is also for the convenience of his own aggression. Now, Ruthenia is full of German National Socialist Party workers, and a large number of incited Ukrainians have been transplanted from Poland to Ruthenia to plan activities together with German agents. It is said that Germany will recently establish a special military agency in the area. Now that Hitler has de facto turned Czechoslovakia into a protectorate, it is naturally easy to establish a center for the Ukrainian independence movement in Czechoslovakia. But how can he force Poland to submit and order it to incorporate the Ukrainian-populated areas into the Independent Ukrainian State? Hitler often feels uneasy about this issue. It is said that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will hire Poland to lobby for this issue.

Since the Ruthenia region has become a base for German military and political activities, southern Poland has felt direct military threats. In addition, the National Socialist Party's seizure of power and demonstrations in Danzig have made the Polish authorities feel like they are sitting on pins and needles. At the same time, the National Socialist Party won a great victory in the Memel election. The chairman of the Memel Area Committee has been filled by National Socialist Party member Bertulon. This is an ominous sign of Germany's invasion of Lithuania. Moreover, Germany has now suppressed Hungary, and its economic and political forces have penetrated into the Balkan countries, invisibly isolating Poland and surrounding it with the Nazi Party. Poland sees through this weakness, so it has shaken hands with the Soviet Union and is working hard to conclude a commercial treaty with Lithuania. Because Germany has ambitions to invade its own territory, Lithuania is also happy to re-negotiate a friendship treaty with Poland to counter this common enemy. In addition, Poland is also working hard to connect with Britain, France, Romania and Yugoslavia, attempting to re-establish an anti-German fascist front.

As for how Hitler can make Russian Ukraine leave the Soviet Union! This is the theme of Hitler's entire plan, and it is also the place where he will run into a wall. Because the Ukrainian ethnic group in the Ukrainian region has enjoyed complete autonomy since the revolution, and has never been oppressed by foreign ethnic groups. Since the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, the industry in the Ukrainian region has increased fivefold. Among the entire Soviet Union, the Ukrainian people are the province that has benefited the most from economic construction after the revolution, so the people naturally warmly support the Soviet government and are not tempted or moved by external forces. In addition, the figures that Germany has always used as leaders of the Ukrainian independence movement, such as Silliwitz, are all representatives of the pre-revolutionary landlord class who abused the poor. Ukrainian farmers recall the slave life of the past, and they still feel pain. Today, they will definitely not follow their shells and be fooled by them. With the powerful national defense of the Soviet Union, Germany would never dare to gamble its country on one throw. Therefore, Hitler's only method now is to first use diplomacy, economy and military force to annex, oppress or intimidate small countries in Eastern Europe, especially Hungary, Romania, Poland, Yugoslavia, and Lithuania (Czechoslovakia is no longer a problem), to open a path directly to Ukraine, and then use diplomacy or military force to occupy Ukraine.

Germany's support for the Ukrainian independence movement is exactly the same as Japan's establishment of the Manchukuo independence movement in China. The future of Eastern Europe will become a place where fascist demons dance. If the small countries do not wake up and unite as soon as possible, they will inevitably be overthrown by the black wave of the fascist frenzy on the European continent, and there will never be a day of peace. But the Soviet Union is a fortress of world peace; she not only holds the determination to save humanity and defend world peace, but also holds the power to destroy all foreign aggression. If the small countries of Eastern Europe can cooperate with the Soviet Union, and the anti-fascist front can succeed quickly, then a strong wall across the European continent will rise from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, serving as a fortress to resist Hitler's eastward invasion, and this fortress can become the tomb of German fascism.

### Legislative Council Convenes Regular Meeting Yesterday; Passes Restriction on Eviction Ordinance; Appoints Five Members to Drafting Committee; Reports on Subsidizing Three Hospitals Plan

The Legislative Council convened a meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday. Attendees included Governor Sir Geoffry Northcote (Chairman), Colonial Secretary Smith, Senior Military Officer General Grassick, Financial Secretary Gimson, Attorney General Ansell, Secretary for Chinese Affairs Cary, Director of Medical and Health Services Todd, Commissioner of Police Henry, Director of Marine Haultain, Director of Public Works Henderson, and unofficial members Brooke, Shroff, Buxon, Todd, Chau Tsun-nin, and Lo Man-kam. The secretary was Hawkins. Colonial Secretary Smith first announced the list of members appointed by the Governor to the "Drafting Committee," stating that the committee was established in 1939 under the Governor's guidance and appointed Attorney General Ansell, Secretary for Chinese Affairs Cary, Brooke, Chau Tsun-nin, and Lo Man-kam as members. The meeting then began: (1) Unofficial member Brooke asked the question, "Will the government make an announcement regarding the financial situation of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals?" The Colonial Secretary answered (the answer is recorded separately in 2). The Colonial Secretary requested the passage of the "Financial Committee Report of December 22, 1938." Gimson seconded, and it was passed. (3) Attorney General Ansell requested the passage of the order issued by the Chief Justice on January 12, 1939, based on Section 32 of the High Court Ordinance of 1873.

### Various Organizations Donate Funds to Aid Guangxi Refugees

Due to the atrocities of warplanes in Guangxi Province, the number of refugees is increasing daily. Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong are actively raising funds for relief. The Women's Welfare Association previously donated 5,000 yuan in national currency. Following that, the local textile merchant guild donated over 460 yuan in national currency. Yesterday, Hong Kong gentleman Ho Kam-tong donated 2,000 yuan in national currency to the Bank of Guangxi in his personal name. In addition, many people have made small donations to the Bank of Guangxi. Manager Zhang Zhaotang is remitting these funds to Guangxi Province free of charge. Those wishing to donate can directly contact the Bank of Guangxi.

The Hong Kong Chinese Women's War Relief Association received HK$206.48 donated by Mr. Huang Kaiji. Peninsula Hotel employees donated salaries. The Aid Association donated 355 cotton vests. The savings box of the Minsheng Cloth Factory contained $4.40, 70 cents in small change, and three silver coins. The students of the private Guangzhou University donated HK$622.35 from the proceeds of a fundraising carnival. Wang Yuquan donated 500 bottles of emergency relief pills.

Improving the Financial Management of the Three Hospitals

The Colonial Secretary's response to the question from Unofficial Member Brooke was as follows: Increasing the financial subsidies for the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals has been under consideration for some time. In early 1936, the directors of the Tung Wah Hospital petitioned the government for a subsidy of 150,000 yuan to cover the deficit in 1937. After discussion, the government has agreed to several steps to improve the financial management of the hospital, specifically agreeing to the following: (A) The Board of Directors should prepare and adhere to an appropriate annual budget and should submit annual financial records audited by an auditor approved by the government. (B) The annual budget should first be approved by the existing permanent advisory committee. (C) The medical and charitable work of each hospital should be handled separately. Separate budgets should be prepared for each department, and the location of the two departments should, to the extent possible, be separated from the Tung Wah Hospital's long-standing and reputable charitable work, such as providing relief to the elderly, weak, poor, and destitute, and providing coffins for burials. (D) All matters related to the medical administration of each hospital will be managed by a medical committee appointed by the Governor. The committee has already been appointed, and the list of members was officially announced on December 16, 1938. The members include the Director of Medical and Health Services or a subordinate official (Chairman), two consultants from the Tung Wah Hospital, three directors, a medical inspector from the Chinese Hospital Medical Bureau, and the attending physicians of Tung Wah Hospital, Tung Wah Eastern Hospital, and Kwong Wah Hospital. (E) Traditional Chinese medicine will still be retained for hospitalized patients to choose from. (F) In the future, the funds of the Tung Wah Hospital will be kept in cash and not used as mortgages or property.

Reviewing the Annual Accounts as Satisfactory

The review of the annual accounts of each hospital was implemented in 1937, and the government found the results satisfactory. The accounting was good. The accountant responsible for the review only suggested a few minor improvements. The proposal to allocate an additional 150,000 yuan to cover the deficit in the hospital's 1937 expenses will be submitted to the Finance Committee meeting to be held after the end of this meeting. The reasons for the deficit are as follows: (A) Increased costs for medical improvements. (B) Increased number of patients, partly due to the current war. (C) Reduced property income. (D) The impact of war relief issues on donations from all sectors to the hospitals. The government firmly believes that the valuable work of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals in benefiting the Chinese people of Hong Kong in the past will not only continue but will also continue to increase its value. The existing cooperation between the directors of the three hospitals and the government will surely be further improved, without affecting the organization of most privately funded charitable organizations. Steps have already been taken to establish guarantees for sound administration. It is hoped that these guarantees will be sufficient to encourage enthusiastic people to continue to donate generously to this great charitable organization to provide financial assistance.

Explaining the Purpose of the Draft Ordinance in Detail

When Attorney General Ansell requested the passage of the draft ordinances, he also explained them, stating that the purpose of this draft ordinance is to close the Governor's Office and Urban Development Fund. From the perspective of the circumstances when the fund was established, this point is greatly related to the public interest, and the Governor has also instructed this seat to provide a detailed explanation of this draft ordinance. The fund was prepared to pay for the construction costs of the great urban development plan (including the sites of the old Governor's Office, the Secretary of State's Office, and the old City Hall, etc.). Part of the City Hall site was sold to the HSBC, and the sale price has been allocated to the fund. At that time, it was also decided that in the future, after other sections of the site were sold, the sale price would be allocated to the fund. At that time, it was hoped that the sale price could offset the construction costs of the Governor's Office, the joint government office building, and the new City Hall. Later, for various reasons, the plan could not be implemented. When Sir Hutt-Jedd was Governor, he expressed his opposition to the entire plan, expressing dissatisfaction with the expansion plan of the Governor's Office and its surrounding sites, believing that there was no need to rebuild the Governor's Office. Therefore, the plan was temporarily shelved.

The Remaining Construction Funds Are Allocated to the Public Treasury

After the Governor took office, he reconsidered the issue. After discussing it with the unofficial members of this council, he issued a memorandum stating that he believed it was appropriate to build a new Governor's Office, but agreed with Sir Hutt-Jedd's objection to the development of the Governor's Office and its surrounding sites. At the same time, he indicated his approval of building a new City Hall with part of it used as government offices. The memorandum pointed out that the 839,000 yuan in the fund could not cover the full construction costs. At the same time, it explained that the remaining part of the sale price of the City Hall site could still be allocated to the fund. However, it was no longer possible to rely solely on the sale price to pay for the construction costs. Therefore, it was recommended that the Governor pay for the reconstruction costs and the development costs of the designated site from public funds, and the remaining funds in the fund would be allocated to the public treasury. The decision to carry out this plan can be seen in Section 11 of the Financial Secretary's memorandum on the financial situation of 1939. The Financial Secretary also mentioned the current draft ordinance at the budget meeting of this council. It is only a legal procedure, requesting this council to pass it. In fact, the established plan has already been canceled, so the fund should also be closed. At the same time, I want to report to everyone that the government is determined to build a new City Hall within an appropriate period. However, because the site has not yet been found, it must be delayed slightly. But consideration of the site issue has already begun. Once a decision is made, construction can begin.

The Finance Committee Passes Supplementary Government Expenses

A finance meeting was held after the meeting, chaired by Colonial Secretary Smith. A request was made to approve supplementary government expenses totaling 1,698,673 yuan, including (1) a total of 1,261,126 yuan in supplementary expenditure budget for the previous session. This supplementary amount is the deficit amount for each expenditure item from item 307 to item 330 of the previous session's expenditure budget. Among them, the actual expenditure that exceeded the budgeted amount the most was item 324, item 28, with a deficit of 312,642 yuan. The second largest was item 319, item 22, the expenditure budget of the Department of Health, with a deficit of 100,500 yuan. (2) The supplementary budget amount for this session reached a total of 437,4147 yuan. Passed.

### Tens of Thousands of Fishermen Adrift, Calling for Help; Fishermen's Association Drafting Petition to Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Requesting British Government Protection for Hong Kong Fishing Vessels Operating

Since the illegal blockade of my coastal coastline in Fujian, unauthorized burning of Hong Kong-registered fishing vessels has been carried out near Hong Kong waters, and fishermen operating at sea have often not been spared. This tragedy has been going on for two years, with thousands of fishing vessels burned and more than 10,000 fishermen killed, resulting in property losses of tens of millions, unprecedented in history. This has led Hong Kong fishermen to warn each other not to go to sea. No fewer than tens of thousands of people are scattered in Cheung Chau, Junk Bay, and Aberdeen, all unemployed and without food or clothing. The situation is extremely miserable. Mr. Xu Shiying already has a complete plan to provide relief to fishermen. He also believes that the destroyed fishing vessels are registered with the Hong Kong government and should not be arbitrarily ravaged and destroyed by the enemy. Therefore, he specifically ordered the Fishermen's Association here to prepare a written report detailing the circumstances of the fishermen's disasters and the damages they have suffered, and submit them separately to the China Relief Committee and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, so that the two agencies can forward them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, directly requesting the British government to provide effective protection for Hong Kong fishermen to operate at sea, in order to maintain the livelihood of fishermen. The Fishermen's Association is now under orders to draft the petition and will send it to the China Relief Committee and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission during the day.

### British Relief Society Holds Bazaar to Raise Funds: Soliciting Items for Charity Sale, Scheduled for Three Days During Lunar New Year, Requesting Generous Donations from All Businesses and Factories

The Hong Kong and South China Branch of the British Relief Fund for Chinese Refugees is actively preparing to hold a charity bazaar from the eighth to the tenth day of the Lunar New Year to raise funds. The collection team held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. with committee members such as Yip Lan-chuen and Lui Yam-sun attending. They decided to first survey businesses, factories, and their representatives to facilitate contact and solicitations, and to send letters to all factories and businesses requesting generous donations.

### Education Authorities Consider Preparations for Emergency Situations: Evacuation of School Children in Wartime

Following recommendations from the Air Defense Department, local education authorities are currently considering the issue of evacuating school children in wartime. The Director of Education recently convened a meeting of teachers from all schools in Hong Kong to discuss air defense and delivered a speech emphasizing the importance of learning about air defense. He instructed all teachers to pay attention to air defense in schools and the evacuation of students. It is understood that each school has received instructions to prepare a wartime school evacuation plan. It is believed that the main point of the evacuation plan is that all schools in Hong Kong will temporarily suspend classes during an emergency, and students will return home. Schools with dormitories must establish air-raid shelters for students who cannot evacuate to their hometowns to ensure their safety during air raids.

### This Month is Auspicious for Marriage: Marriage Registry Extremely Busy Lately

The number of marriages registered at the Hong Kong Marriage Registry last month increased significantly, totaling as many as 46 cases, of which only four involved foreigners. On the 24th of last month alone, Deputy Marriage Registrar Mr. Carter officiated eight marriages. On the 18th, there were also seven marriages, five of which were officiated by Mr. Carter. This is likely because the lunar calendar considered that month to be particularly auspicious. This month may also be a similar "marriage" month, as there were three marriages registered at the aforementioned registry the day before yesterday and six yesterday.

### Lam Pak-sang's Wounds Unhealed: Public Trial Postponed

Lam Pak-sang was shot and injured near Alexandra House on the afternoon of the 17th of last month. The suspect, Chan Sik-lam, was brought before the Central Magistracy again yesterday morning. The prosecuting officer, Mr. Wan, stated that Lam Pak-sang's wounds had not yet healed and that he would need to be hospitalized for a considerable period before being discharged. Therefore, the date for the public trial could not be determined. As a result, the judge ordered that the suspect, Chan Sik-lam, be remanded in custody for another week.

### Forty Units of Public Housing in Ma Tau Chung, Kowloon: Associations Provide Loans for Construction, Refugees Can Apply for Tenancy

### Imperial Aviation Aircraft "Geolier" Attacked: Captain Details Incident: Location West of Weizhou Island, 350 Miles from Hong Kong, Japanese Warship Fired Five Shots but Fortunately No Hits

The Imperial Airways Hong Kong-Hanoi route aircraft "Geolier" was attacked by a Japanese warship on the morning of the 31st of last month when it flew out of Hong Kong at 7 a.m. over Weizhou Island. Captain Wilson, who piloted the "Danapoora" back to Hong Kong at 3 p.m. yesterday, described the incident.

Details of the Incident

On Monday, the "Geolier" and "Danapoora" departed Hong Kong one after the other, with the "Geolier" departing thirty minutes earlier. The flight altitude at the time was 1,000 feet. After passing the location where fishing boats had been burned, they discovered a warship south of Weizhou Island. Two minutes later, another warship was seen docked west of the island. This warship appeared to be a transport ship. While I was intently looking down, a fire suddenly erupted to my left. I realized that the warship was firing at the "Geolier." One or two minutes later, the co-pilot, Mr. Shen Wei, saw the warship continue to fire. The first shot flew high over the aircraft, and I saw it splash into the sea. The four shots after that all fell into the sea, missing the aircraft. Only one shot was at the same altitude as the aircraft and exploded with a loud noise, but the aircraft was not damaged.

Confirmed as a Japanese Warship

The vessel firing the shots was a transport ship. The other warship did not take any action. The nationality of the ship could not be determined. However, the incident occurred to the left of Tu Chau, and Weizhou Island was already in the hands of the Japanese, so the ship firing the shots was undoubtedly a Japanese warship. After the aircraft was attacked, I sent a telegram to the "Danapoora" to inform them of the situation and advised them to change their flight path and avoid passing Weizhou Island. Therefore, they fortunately arrived safely.

Temporary Change of Route

The Imperial Airways Hong Kong-Hanoi route usually flies from Norway Island to Chikam, and must fly over Weizhou Island. The route has long been established and has been in operation for many days. Since the "Geolier" was attacked, when the "Danapoora" returned to Hong Kong from Hanoi, it avoided flying over Weizhou Island and flew 40 miles south of the island to avoid another attack. In the future, the Hong Kong-Hanoi route may be temporarily changed. Yesterday, the aircraft carried 1,447 pounds of mail when it returned to Hong Kong. There were no passengers.

### The Confluence of Refugees: A Trip to Shenzhen

— Lo Ha

Shenzhen, once known as the "Monte Carlo" of the East, and the Yau Sang Company, a large gambling den, and the battlefield of countless battles, has now become a confluence for refugees. The Relief Group of the United Relief Committee for South China Refugees has been working diligently here for two months. To inspect the situation and take a look at the desolate remnants of its plunder, the reporter went there for a comprehensive tour.

In the morning, I took the 10 o'clock train to Lo Wu, accompanied by more than twenty colleagues, two female members of the Chinese Youth Ambulance Corps, and the talkative and cheerful Lam Pui-sang, a representative of the Relief Group of the Refugee Relief Committee. There was no need to worry about being lonely! The laughter of "giggling and quacking" filled the carriage. Before long, the train had arrived at Lo Wu. After getting off the train and passing the high stacks of sandbags and the iron-net fences, we saw the national flag of the Republic of China flying high on an iron pole. Combined with the bright sunshine, blue clouds, green trees, and open fields, everything was filled with joy and smiles. Yes, the motherland and its rivers and mountains are lovely! They are worthy of being cherished! From the railway tracks, we could already see the shadow of the Yau Sang Company. Green tiles and red walls stood beside the railway tracks, and the surrounding small rivers were like a colorful jade belt tying this majestic palace.

Although the interior of the Yau Sang Company is covered with spiderwebs, collapsed, and dilapidated, it still wears a beautiful coat and retains a history that makes people sigh!

Clean Refugee Rooms

Walking past the right side of the Yau Sang Company, the bamboo fence marks the location of the refugee shelter. Inside, there are five shelters, accommodating more than 3,000 refugees. The auditorium of the Shenzhen Theatre has been converted into the first shelter. Inside, wooden boards are used to build two-story "bunk beds." Each bed is for two people. The auditorium is very spacious, and the light is quite sufficient. The new "bunk" beds are covered with brand new straw mats, giving people a sense of cleanliness and joy. Although flies are flying outside, they are not seen much inside the shelter. This is a very good phenomenon. The person in charge quietly told the reporter that the former Hong Kong Acting Chief Medical Officer of Health inspected the shelter and did not cover his nose with a handkerchief. Compared with the New Territories, this is indeed a significant improvement.

My Clothes are Extremely Dirty

You can't see flies in the refugee sleeping rooms. As soon as you run out of the refugee room, these dirty bombers—flies—chase the refugees, with a somewhat persistent demeanor. The reporter became curious. Could the flies be afraid of the smell of the new straw mats in the room? Oh dear, a smell of moldy vegetables, like poison gas, pierced people's hearts and lungs, almost suffocating them! A refugee saw this situation and said with a bitter smile, "Sir, my clothes are extremely dirty. I haven't changed them since I fled here." The reporter calmed down and asked him, "Then, what about bathing?" He said without hesitation, "I'm too lazy to bother since I don't have clothes to change, and water is often scarce. It's almost a problem to even drink."

The reporter looked at his yellowed teeth and dark yellow face, which was a little scary. "Water is indeed a problem!" The reporter thought as he ran, but later he saw some female refugees washing their hair in many places. After running to other places for a detailed inspection, he realized that the water shortage was not as severe as that refugee said. However, it is true that there is a serious shortage of clothing. It is said that because there are few clothes and many people, every time clothes are distributed, it is like hungry people抢饭. Once there's a commotion, they are all gone. It is likely that some refugees are too lazy to bathe because they cannot get clothes. Therefore, we sincerely hope that enthusiastic people will donate more old clothes. At the same time, we also hope that the responsible personnel inside will take strong measures. No matter what, the refugees must bathe every few days so that the refugees' hygiene and cleanliness can be improved.

I Haven't Tasted Pork

After looking at the five refugee rooms, we turned to the dining hall. The square dining hall is covered with sunflower bamboo. Inside, there are piles of red bricks. "What? Breaking stones?" a colleague couldn't help but ask with a smile. "Breaking what stones? Those are dining tables, and those are seats," the person in charge said while gesturing. It turned out that the stone tables and benches, combined with the surrounding green trees, made this dining hall quite interesting. The refugees came to this place in queues when it was time to eat, which seemed to be in order. However, most of them were still complaining, "I haven't tasted pork. Every meal is just vegetables and soybeans!" It is said that a meat dish will be added starting from the 15th, so the refugees will no longer have to sigh about not having meat.

Refugees are generally uneducated, so we naturally hope that those in charge will increase the amount of meat provided to them as much as possible. The most important thing is to find a way to make them understand their situation so that they will not be so greedy.

I Haven't Been Avoiding Certain Foods

The medical care is provided by people from the Chinese Medical Association who take turns serving the refugees. There is also a ward for hospitalized patients. This ward is located on the floor above the consultation room. The hospitalized patients sleep on new canvas beds, covered with new cotton quilts. The air is not bad, and there is a thermos bottle on each person's bedside. Everything is very thoughtful, and they are quite comfortable. The maternity ward is also under construction. The medical facilities in the future will naturally be very complete. However, what is still lacking at present is the "avoidance of certain foods" for patients. Several refugees made this request to the reporter.

How to Train Refugee Children

In an open space, a group of refugee children, both boys and girls, are performing calisthenics. They are wearing messy and tattered clothes, and some girls are still wearing braids. While shouting slogans, they are moving. What a meaningful and interesting picture this is! It is said that initially, their parents were unwilling to let their children come out for training. Fortunately, the person in charge came up with a way, telling them that biscuits would be given to the children. As a result, all the children in the shelter came, and they took the opportunity to keep their children and start training them. Now, there have been very significant results. There is also a refugee school that is about to open. The education of refugee children has also been resolved.

Refugee Skills Registration

In the refugee shelter, many people have specialized skills. The shelter is now actively registering and starting to use them, such as doing woodwork for sheds and masonry work. Most of the talents needed in the shelter are selected from the refugees. Various jobs such as pig farming and vegetable cultivation are also being prepared to fully utilize the refugees' production capacity. Regarding cultural nourishment, a small library has already been established, and it will continue to be expanded in the future.

Finally, we feel that it is very commendable that this refugee shelter has achieved so much in such a short period. However, we still earnestly hope that the above-mentioned shortcomings can be actively improved.

Transportation & Travel

### News from Nanchang

— Authored by Smedley, Translated by Tan Zinong

—Japanese and Chinese Wounded Soldiers and Others—

(1) A Glimpse of the Second First Aid Station

At eight o'clock in the evening, I stayed at the Second First Aid Station in Nanchang, where the staff were very busy. There were eight hundred wounded soldiers, making this one of the best first aid stations in Nanchang. Nanchang has a total of nine first aid stations. The wounded soldiers were lying in rows in huge rooms, this first aid station originally being a school. The beds they lay on were Chinese beds—that is, a large wooden board supported by two wooden benches. A straw mat was placed on the bed, covered with a woven mat. The military medical department issued each wounded soldier with a cotton quilt, but three hundred were donated by the citizens of Nanchang. Upstairs and downstairs, there were male and female singing groups singing to entertain the wounded soldiers. The group closest to us consisted of two women and an old man. The old man played the huqin (Chinese violin), and the women sang songs, one of whom was blind. They mostly sang folk songs. They sang as they walked, interspersed with many patriotic songs. The wounded soldiers here were all from the De'an front line and were also elite soldiers of the Guangdong army.

(2) Hardworking Staff

This first aid station provides care for an average of 3,600 people per month. The general manager is an old military doctor. He is helpful and enthusiastic, which he takes pride in. He said that if a large group of new wounded soldiers arrived, the staff would work all night. The staff there includes a station master and a deputy station master, four doctors, twenty nurses, and ten attendants, specializing in applying medicine. The staff in the station donate part of their monthly salary to help with the extra meals for seriously wounded soldiers. The government's expenses are enormous. Patriotic people are also willing to 'sacrifice their hunger for the public good.'

The secretary of the Jiangxi Anti-Japanese War Service Federation works in this reporting conference. This federation was organized in August 1937 and is directly under the provincial party headquarters. Recently, it has expanded its organization to include many mass organizations, such as the Mobilization Committee, the Women's Life Promotion Association, the Women's Voice Society, and the wartime Jiangxi Youth League. This reorganized federation has a drug relief team with four hundred staff members who bravely work deep in the trenches of the front line. It also has a "Fundraising Committee" and two propaganda departments, which go deep into the masses to conduct propaganda among children, youth, women, merchants, workers, and farmers.

The work of the "Fundraising Committee" is very significant. The government ordered it to raise 100,000 sets of cotton clothes and 120,000 cotton vests. They have already raised 80,000 cotton vests and 16,000 sets of cotton clothes, all voluntarily donated by the people. However, they were not raised solely from Nanchang; they were raised from all over Jiangxi Province. They hope to complete their mission in two weeks.

Route from Hong Kong to Yunnan via Haiphong

1.  For Meixian, Jiaoling, Pingyuan, etc., Meixian can be the center. There are highways from Jiaoping to Meixian. Then, from Meixian to Songkou (there are highways and waterways), take an electric boat from Songkou down the Tingjiang River directly to Chao'an, then transfer to the Chaoshan Railway to Shantou. In Shantou, wait for a boat to Hong Kong. From Meixian, take a car to Songkou, costing 2.4 yuan in Guangdong currency (taking a private boat costs about 8 jiao; electric boats are only available in the spring). From Songkou to Chao'an costs 1.68 yuan in Guangdong currency. From Chao'an to Shantou, the third-class fare is 7 jiao in national currency, the second-class fare is 1.1 yuan, and the first-class fare is unknown. To Xingning, Wuhua, Longchuan, Zijin, etc., you can take routes through Fengshun, Jieyang, and Puning to Shantou. To northern Guangdong, you can take routes through Qujiang and Hengyang, or through Lianping, Longchuan, Wuhua, and various highways to Shantou. As for Shantou to Hong Kong, there are regular foreign ships and irregular ships sailing, which take 16 hours to reach. The fares often vary depending on the situation and cannot be fixed. Half a year ago, the first-class fare was about 35 yuan in national currency, and the third-class fare was 6 yuan. Renting a canvas bed from a fellow passenger costs about 1 to 3 yuan in national currency. From Hong Kong to Haiphong in Annam, there are French postal ships and Taikoo ships to Sichuan and Yunnan, etc., and Guangdong and Duobao, etc., departing every five days. The French postal ships take about 40 hours, and the Taikoo ships take about four to five days. In addition, there are Jardine Matheson's Wo Sang and Ming Sang, etc. The schedules of various shipping companies can be found in the shipping schedule section of this newspaper. The fares are listed below:

Second Class Third Class Fourth Class

French Postal Ship 54.0 30.0 20.0 All in Vietnamese currency

Taikoo Ship 34.0 25.0 11.0 All in Hong Kong currency

(Each Vietnamese yuan is currently equivalent to 1.7 yuan in national currency or 9 jiao in Hong Kong currency)

Haiphong hotels include Natural, Paris, New Asia, and New China, which serve Cantonese, Shanghai, and English speakers. Room rates are approximately 1 Vietnamese yuan per day.

From Haiphong to Kunming, take the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which takes four days and three nights in an ordinary passenger car. The fare and schedule are as follows:

On the first day, Haiphong to Hanoi takes 3 hours. Hanoi hotels include Tongli Natural, with double rooms costing 3 Vietnamese yuan and single rooms costing 1.5 yuan.

(3) Japanese Wounded Soldiers Who Hate War

In a hospital, the Red Cross medical team cares for ten Japanese wounded soldiers. The doctor working there can speak Japanese because he studied medicine in Japan. The Japanese wounded soldiers told him many unpleasant things. They frankly said: "I really don't know what the war is for?" Although I came here to participate in the war, I don't know what it is for. Many factories in Japan have closed their doors, and only the military factories are working day and night. The lives of our women and children are very difficult!" It is truly a long silence of sighs!

One Japanese wounded soldier captured spoke about his father's story. He said that his elderly father was a soldier in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 and often told him about the horrors of war. The prisoner said: "When I put on my uniform and said goodbye to my father, he cried loudly. We are so poor, and now prices in Japan are constantly soaring, making it impossible to live!" He almost broke down in tears as he recounted this.

Another Japanese wounded soldier captured was born in Guangdong and speaks fluent Cantonese. When the prelude to the war began, he was recalled to the country to join the army and fight in China. During the Battle of De'an, he was captured due to injury. During the fierce battle, he heard Chinese soldiers speaking Cantonese. He was afraid of dying in battle and hated the Japanese militarists' invasion of China even more, so he walked into the ranks of the Chinese army, explained the situation in Cantonese, and asked them not to kill him. This is a story told by the Guangdong army returning from the front line.

(4) The Chinese Spirit of Resistance Active Everywhere

A dozen of us traveled together to the front line by car. Several Chinese people traveling with us could represent the Chinese people. One was a university professor from Shandong Province and his wife from Beiping. Two were students from Shanghai, one from a scholarly family. One was a farm girl from Wuhu. One was a middle-aged farmer... the organizer of the peasant guerrillas, and one was a small worker from Guangzhou; he is now our driver, bravely driving at full speed, rushing to the front line. One was a senior political worker in the Guangdong army.

After nightfall, just after a torrential rain, our car drove off the road and almost into the river. Fortunately, an electric pole stopped us, preventing a "submersion" disaster. In the rain and darkness, we worked together. We used weeds and stones to support one rear wheel, while the driver lay under the muddy car to lift the car that had gone off course with a car jack. Our farmer immediately thought of a shovel, so he borrowed one from a nearby house and diligently dug a small ditch behind the undamaged wheel. However, the road was mostly gravel. We took turns digging, with the Chinese civilian and the professor guiding us on how to dig more easily. The two students failed, and my main job, in addition to digging the mud on the road surface, was to patrol back and forth, because I was afraid that once the electric pole broke, our car would easily fall into the river!

We spent a total of three hours on the "car rescue" work. Digging this small ditch was very difficult. After digging, the undamaged wheel drove down, causing the other dangerous wheel to rise, and we were no longer as afraid of falling into the river after the electric pole broke. We also built a small levee on the side of the dangerous wheel; when our car returned to the road, we couldn't help but cheer loudly.

The Guangxi political worker loudly said that we must fill the small ditch we dug in the road with dirt, because the following vehicles would think that the traitors had buried landmines, etc. So we used the shovel, two boards, and our hands to fill the dirt back to its original state. The descendant of the scholarly family was covered in mud, the professor's hands were also stained with dirt, and our shoes and clothes were splashed with mud and water. Other male and female companions were also like this. So we wiped our hands on the wet grass, cheered loudly, and embarked on the journey again, looking forward to the front line. This spirit—the spirit of unity and perseverance—is the sugar spirit of the Chinese resistance! (Special)

### Travel Notes from Hunan and Guangxi (Continued)

—Shuai Yucang

In the minds of most people in the past, Guangxi was a border region, with barren land, a tough population, and a backward culture. However, when we arrived in Quan County, what we saw was the opposite. Life here is simple and unpretentious, which is sufficient. I remember Mr. Lei Binnan published an article in the Guangxi Daily called "A Glimpse of the Study of Local Culture in Guangxi," which quoted a passage from the Guangxi General Records: "In Guangxi, marriage does not emphasize wealth, and betel nuts, pork, and wine are distributed to relatives. When guests arrive, after tea, betel nuts are offered. Prayers are made for illness, and funerals favor Buddhism. Burials may involve stacking stones to surround the tomb. There is no fixed offering for sacrifices. Cleanliness is not as good as in the Central Plains. Generally, customs emphasize simplicity. Clothing does not favor fine silk; wealthy families only wear it during auspicious ceremonies, and villagers may not see it once in their lives. Eating is only for sustenance, and banquets only have chicken and ordinary dishes. Houses are made of brick and wood, or bamboo is used for beams, pillars, and tiles, but they are not strong. Other than that, there are thatched roofs and earthen walls, and ancient customs still remain. Scholars only value copying books, and farmers do not know how to store them. Craftsmen only learn rough skills, and merchants only trade within a hundred miles, without venturing far to seek profit." The Guangxi General Records were compiled in the sixteenth year of the Yongzheng reign of the Qing Dynasty, more than two hundred years ago. During my month-long stay in Quan County, I felt that the people's thriftiness was not much different from what was described in the passage above.

Quan County is the entrance to the northern border of Guangxi, and the population is currently increasing rapidly. Housing is also in short supply, just like in Banlin. As a result, housing prices are rising daily. Currently, houses in the Qingxiang Town area of the city cost about three to five yuan per room (national currency), and the rising prices of other daily necessities go without saying.

Regarding education in Guangxi, it is currently flourishing. Because many cultural institutions from lost territories have moved to Guangxi, many universities and schools have come. The original basic schools in various towns and villages are already numerous. In Quan County, there is one provincial middle school and one church-run middle school. Recently, the Wuhan County Joint Middle School has also moved here, which is truly good news for Guangxi's culture.

4.  Transportation in Guangxi

The transportation network of Guangxi Province is something that we should understand during our travels. The following is a summary for reference:

(A) Those who come from Hunan via Quan County, Xing'an, and Fanchuan to Guilin can disperse to various counties along the highway. (1) From Guilin along the Li River, you can reach Yangshuo, Pingle, Zhaoping, and other counties. (2) Along the Guili Highway, you can reach Yangshuo and Lipu. (3) From Lipu, travel northeast along the Liba Road to reach Pingle, Gongcheng, Zhongshan, Mao County, and other counties. (4) From Lipu, travel west along the Lilu Road through Xiuren, Liujiang, and Rong to reach Liuzhou. (5) From Liuzhou, travel north along the Liuzhang Road through Liucheng to reach Chang'an Town in Rong County. (6) From Liuzhou, travel south along the Liuhe River to reach Wuzhou. Along the river are Xiang County, Wuxuan, Guiping, Pingnan, Teng County, and other counties. (7) From Liuzhou, travel west along the Guizhou-Guizhou Highway to reach Yishan, Hechi, Nandan, and other counties. (8) From Liuzhou, travel southwest along the Liubin Road to reach Qianjiang and Binyang. (9) From Binyang, travel southeast to reach Guixian, Yongchun, Hengxian. (10) From Binyang, travel southwest along the Yongbin Road to Nanning. Then, travel southwest along the Yonglong Road through Mingjiang and Ningming to reach Longzhou. (11) From Nanning, travel northwest along the Yongse Road through Wuming, Guode, and Tiandong to reach Baise.

(B) Those who travel from Guangdong to Wuzhou can disperse via waterways, taking boats to Pingnan, Teng County, Guiping, Guixian, Hengxian, Yongfu, Yongning, and then heading northwest to Baise, or south to Longzhou. From Guiping, heading north, you can reach Ruizhou.

(Note 1) "Lanner" refers to an introducer.

(Note 2) "Hand-tossing the sky" refers to ten days.

### Special Shipping News

The Naval Administration Department received a telegram from the captain of the American-Chinese Steamer reporting that while sailing at 22.14 degrees East longitude and 114.25 degrees North latitude, they discovered a broken boat drifting at sea. After receiving the report, the Naval Administration Department specifically instructed all ships passing through the aforementioned location to pay attention to navigation to avoid danger.

China Travel Service Q&A Column

### Shortcut to Hong Kong from Sihui - Answer to Mr. Liang Zhiwei

Question: (1) What is the method for remitting money back to Sihui County?

(2) What is the fastest and most economical route from Sihui County to Hong Kong?

(3) Does Sihui have a China Travel Service?

(4) Can I entrust the China Travel Service to remit money back to Sihui County on my behalf?

Answer: (1) Remittances between Hong Kong and Sihui are currently temporarily unavailable.

(2) From Sihui to Hong Kong, you can try going to Jiangmen first, and then taking a ferry to Shiqi. The ferry fare is about 8 jiao in national currency. After arriving in Shiqi, wait for a bus to Macau. The bus fare is 3 yuan in silver dollars. From Macau, come to Hong Kong.

(3) Sihui does not have a China Travel Service.

(4) Because there is no branch, we cannot remit funds.

### From North Borneo to Singapore - Answer to Mr. Zhu Yuqiang

Question: I am very grateful for your answer to "From North Borneo to Singapore"! I still have some questions that are not clear, which are listed in detail below:

(1) Mr. So-and-so has lived in Sandakan for more than two years. When he recently returned to China, he had a "Registration Certificate for Overseas Chinese and a Passport from the Chinese Consulate in Sandakan" and a "Guarantee from the Sandakan Chinese Affairs Department." If he now intends to go directly from "Hong Kong" or "Shantou" to Singapore, does he still need to obtain a passport to go abroad?

(2) British ships cost 20 pounds, and German ships cost 11 pounds. What is the equivalent in national currency? How much are the miscellaneous expenses?

(3) Does Shantou have a transportation travel agency that can handle this?

(4) If a passport to go abroad is required, is a store guarantor still required if there is a passport from the consulate?

(5) If you take a cabin to Singapore, are you subject to Singapore's restrictions on Chinese immigrants? Can you disembark freely?

Answer: (1) You have a Registration Certificate for Overseas Chinese and a passport from the Chinese Consulate in Sandakan. It is not clear what type of passport this refers to. We cannot answer unless you provide further details. However, if you have a residence permit issued by the Sandakan government, you still need to obtain a passport to go abroad in Shantou or Hong Kong.

(2) Each British pound is equivalent to more than 30 yuan in national currency, or about 16.1 yuan in Hong Kong currency.

(3) It is not clear whether Shantou has a transportation travel agency.

(4) It is best to submit the so-called consulate passport to the Hong Kong China Travel Service for verification.

(5) For new passengers from Hong Kong to Singapore, each class is limited to 25 people. New passengers are encouraged to take second-class seats.

### South China Players Start Joint Training to Prepare for Summer Tour of Australia. South China Already Toured Australia Seventeen Years Ago

(Our Newspaper Special Dispatch) It has been seventeen years since the South China Athletic Association football team first toured Australia.

That tour of Australia by South China can be said to be a great achievement in sports diplomacy, and it was also a forward path for South China's football development.

I remember it was the summer of 1923. The South China team, led by Mr. Eng Moh, braved the winds and waves, setting off for Australia. Li Huitang, whose golden age was just beginning, was also among the expedition members.

Embarking on the journey, they engaged in more than twenty matches, learning from the strengths of others and compensating for their own weaknesses, eventually achieving satisfactory results and returning triumphantly.

After returning, they continued to participate in the 1923-24 First Division League. In every competition, they fully utilized the experience and skills gained during their tour of Australia, making each friendly team fearful and unmatched, and finally winning the championship for the first time.

Recently, South China has planned a second tour of Australia and has already made contact regarding the prospects, which are promising and hopefully will come to fruition.

This expedition is planned on a large scale, intending to first compete in areas of Southeast Asia such as Malaya and Java, before moving to Australia. Although the tour of Australia may be subject to future changes, even if it becomes just talk, the tours of Malaya and Java are already decided and will definitely happen.

Therefore, Director Mok, planning for any eventuality, gathered a group of players the day before yesterday to hold a symposium to discuss the expedition plan, and decided that from the date of the meeting, everyone would begin joint training to prepare for the upcoming expedition.

The departure date is approximately after the end of this year's football league. As for the entire itinerary, it will take at least four months. If it is just a solo tour of Southeast Asia, it will take two months.

### Academic Sports Association Advocates Group Competition. Academic Sports Abolishes Overall Championship

The Standing Committee of the Hong Kong Schools Sports Federation held its fourth meeting yesterday (the 1st) at the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Middle School. Pan Yau-shing was elected as chairman, Wu Yan-kun as secretary, and after the formalities were completed, the agenda was started. (A) Report Items: (1) Reading of the minutes of the third Standing Committee meeting, which were passed without objection. (2) Deng Zhiqing reported on the participation in the cross-country race. (3) Sir Lo Yuk-ho sent a letter agreeing to serve as honorary president of the Federation. (4) Gao Xicheng and Zhang Minquan sent letters agreeing to serve as consultants of the Federation. (B) Discussion Items: (1) Deng Zhiqing proposed postponing the inaugural meeting and changing the previously set method, and simultaneously inviting newspaper reporters and sports technicians staying in Hong Kong. The proposal was passed. (2) The Organizing Committee of the First Hong Kong Inter-school Track and Field Meet submitted the organizational regulations for approval and implementation. The regulations were passed with amendments. (3) Deng Jixi proposed that the overall championship be abolished in the track meet and group competition be advocated. The proposal was passed and referred to the First Hong Kong Inter-school Games Committee for consideration. (4) Huang Dunhan submitted a plan for holding a symposium on specific sports issues for a decision. The proposal was passed and referred to the Design Committee for handling. (5) Huang Dunman submitted a draft implementation plan for sports and health for discussion. The proposal was passed and sent to the Documentation Group for distribution to schools for reference. (6) Deng Jixi submitted a draft plan for publishing publications for a public decision. The proposal was passed with amendments, and Deng Zhiqing, Huang Jikeng, Pan Yau-shing, Huang Dunhan, Deng Jixi, Wu Dakin, Liang Jietang, etc., were appointed to form an editorial committee responsible for handling the matter, with Deng Jixi as director. (7) Ye Bichen proposed setting a date for the fourth plenary meeting of the council. It was decided to hold it at 7:00 PM on February 8th.

Improve the Incentive System

Deng Jixi, chairman of the Hong Kong Training Committee, proposed that the overall championship should be abolished in Hong Kong inter-school track and field and group competition should be advocated. The original text is as follows: (Hui You) In the past, sports meets have set up overall championships to reward and urge sports teams as an encouragement. However, the gains and losses, honor and disgrace, of the overall championship only belong to one team. The encouragement and urging effect mostly affects the organizers and less affects the general youth. As a result, it only enhances the glory of the organizing body, and the athletes are merely its tools. Today, the promotion of physical education should encourage the general lower-level youth, not just the urging personnel at the upper level. Therefore, the past system has suffered from many problems, and various means are used to attract athletes in order to gain social vanity. In reality, only a few athletes with some skills can enjoy the benefits of sports. The vast majority of weak students are ignored. The overall championship has not been seen to have a good effect on the universalization of sports. Therefore, it is hoped that the inter-school track and field meet organized by the Federation will be replaced by group competition. As for the system that can directly encourage the athletes themselves, it should be preserved as much as possible. Group competition encourages all teams to universalize sports and abolishes the past wrong plan of cultivating only a part of the athletes. Therefore, this proposal is made. (Method) Each school participates with a unit of thirty people, divided into group 6000-meter relay championship, group long jump championship, group shot put championship, with scores based on total points as the principle, not aiming at outstanding performance. The groups are divided into male A, B, C, D, and female A, B. Rewards are divided into trophies for each group of men and women.

Plan for Holding a Symposium

The passed plan for holding a symposium on sports issues is divided into five items: (1) Purpose: To rationalize the provision of sports facilities, broadly solicit sports theories, and jointly promote the Federation's affairs. (2) Scope of the symposium: Topic: How to realize the rationalization of school sports facilities. Content: (A) Current status of school sports facilities in Hong Kong. (B) How to improve and develop school sports in Hong Kong. (C) Exploration of the Federation's theory of popularizing sports. (D) Exploration of the Federation's proposed medal system theory. (E) Theoretical exploration of the Federation's organized friendship sports meet. (3) Nomination letters from the academic community: (A) Sports community. (B) Sports community. (C) Medicine and health. (D) Educational scholars. (4) Date: To be held after the Federation's inauguration ceremony. (5) Chairmanship and preparation: To be chaired by the Mountain Design Committee, with Standing Committee members appointed to prepare.

### South China Prepares for Eastern. Careful Lineup

(Our Newspaper Special Dispatch) This weekend, South China and Eastern will have a special Silver Shield rematch. The previous match between the two teams ended in a draw, with no winner determined, hence this rematch. South China is preparing to meet the challenge and attaches great importance to the lineup. It is rumored that Zhang Manrong may not be used in the left wing position to replace the suspended Li Shuoyou, or Lu Dakeng may be assigned to the position. Although Dakeng's skills are quite good, he is inferior to Manrong in many aspects. It is actually better to use Manrong, but because of his foot injury before, he has been resting for a long time, and it is unknown how he will perform on the field again. Central midfielder Lin Depu has recovered from his foot injury and should be able to participate in this match, otherwise, You Juxing should be used instead, which is better than Yang Genbao. The reporter specially proposed the following lineup. I wonder if the officials of the South China Football Department will agree to adopt it?

Xie Jinhong Zhang Manrong

Tan Jun'gan

Liu Mao Liu Weipei

Xie Jinhong Lin Deti You Juxing

Zhang Manrong Liu Songsheng Chen Dehui Li Enke Yang Shuiqian

### Overexertion and its Prevention

— Wang Xuezheng

If we want to achieve the greatest effect from sports, we must apply both lightness and heaviness, qi and force. Qi refers to "endurance" (Starrfna). The methods of training "qi" and training "force" are different.

In other words, on the one hand, we must make the muscles grow in size and develop the muscles. On the other hand, we must promote the body's metabolism. The body's metabolism is directly proportional to the muscle contraction. The greater the muscle consumption, the greater the improvement in its effectiveness, and it can also normalize and activate blood circulation. To develop muscles, you must do exercises that require "force," that is, heavy exercises with fewer repetitions or shorter duration. To promote the body's metabolism and normalize and activate blood circulation, you must do exercises that require "qi," that is, light exercises with more repetitions or longer duration. The former is heavy exercise, and although the latter is very easy, it can also be very strenuous if the duration is too long.

Overexertion can make the body's metabolism too active, which prevents the body from reacting normally, and blood circulation is also hindered. This is not only useless to the body but also harmful. From this, we can know that if we do exercises to develop muscles and train "force," that is, strenuous exercises, on the one hand, we must also use light exercises to promote the body's metabolism and normalize and activate the functions of various organs and train endurance. Otherwise, it can cause the harm of overexertion.

In addition to this, there are two other reasons for overexertion: (1) errors in the exercise itself, (2) insufficient nutrition and rest.

Regarding errors in the exercise itself, in addition to the lightness, heaviness, and amount of exercise, failure to develop all parts of the body evenly is also a reason. (Above)

### Movies and Dramas

Entertainment......Rural Scenery

South Riding

British films have made great progress in recent years. "Golden Drum Thunder" and this film, which were released in Hong Kong on New Year's Day, are good examples. "Rural Scenery" is originally a famous literary work. The author, Wfnfred Hoitby, is a writer who is extremely concerned about social and political issues. What is depicted in the film reflects a standard British village, where there are stubborn landlords who are gradually declining and villagers who are struggling with poverty and disease, as well as a large number of children who have no opportunity to be educated, living in dirty and unsanitary places. The film also depicts a group of people who are enthusiastic about social undertakings, trying hard to transform this village, while exposing the self-serving and selfish hypocrisy of those who only say nice things but cannot take responsibility for their own actions.

The main actors, such as Anna Jingsi and Rolf Lee Quexin, also give excellent and refined performances. The other actors also have their own achievements.

Queen's Peace. Sixty Years of Zhou Yingying Palace

Sixty Glorious Years

This film is also about the glorious history of Queen Victoria's life, but it is more detailed than the previous one. It includes many important achievements during her 60-year reign. In order to be solemn and true, it was specially produced by the British Royal Company, but it also has a bit of propaganda about the history of the British Queen.

Because the material is particularly real, and those materials must not be removed or deleted, then in this situation, the director is not easy to please and handle properly. This film has made this mistake. The whole play, except for the first half, which writes about the Queen's life after marriage, is slightly vivid and lively. In the second half, it is just like a historical fragment, as an institutional introduction. This cannot be blamed on the director's ability.

There are several very superior aspects to the whole film, such as the Queen's life after marriage, the rush of the British Royal Army, the Queen's Jubilee commemoration, and later visiting her old palace maid. These are all worth mentioning. In terms of actors, there are no major changes from the previous film "The Great History of the British Queen." Anna Weiger, who plays the Queen, gives an excellent performance, especially in her old age. Anton Wahlberg, who plays Prince Albert, is also quite excellent.

Eastern...Three Friends After the War

Three Comrades

It is also the third immortal masterpiece by German Remarque after "All Quiet on the Western Front" and "Return to the West." The background of the film is the same as the previous two films in Germany after the war.

The whole film is handled with such agility and dynamism under the lively means of director Bao Caiqi. At the same time, there are also some interesting and wonderful descriptions. The personality of the three strong men is particularly successfully captured and is extremely strong.

In terms of performance, Robert Taylor, Flange Tong, and Roger Tayang are all very hardworking and are indeed successful works. Of course, we still remember the achievements of the heroine Maglanta Sullivan in "Old Grudges and New Sorrows" with John Bosis. She also has a great harvest here.

Dahua...Wise Judge

Judge Hardy's Children

The pattern of the story is no different from "Beauty is Easy to Grow Old". It writes that Hatai received a call from the government to return to Beijing to preside over matters. As a result, the family moved from the countryside to Washington. Unfortunately, Hatai was deceived by a friend, and his daughter Manli almost fell into vanity and was deceived by others. The son, Andre, also made a very humorous romance. Finally, he returned to his hometown, living an old life.

Director George Hess handled this ordinary educational story and had very delicate methods, drawing the personality of each character on the screen very vividly, and some of the passages and dialogues in it made the audience feel particularly tasteful. In terms of actors, the most successful is Miguel Lonnie, and Shirley Parker is also very cute. The other supporting roles are all well-done.

New World...Women's World

Cantonese Movie

The plot depicts the story of a group of female boarders in a women's apartment. The apartment contains all kinds of characters. They each have their own profession, but it is extremely complicated. Among them, there are female students, female reporters, female salespeople, singers, female dancers, etc. Almost all the employed women in the city are included here. The women are quarrelsome, and they each have their own experiences. It is not impossible to say that it is a collection of women in the city. However, the progress of the drama's storyline is very loose and forced because there is no man to entrust, which does not arouse the audience's interest. At the same time, this film can only describe the general private lives of ordinary women, such as disputes and quarrels, but the description of women in a wide range has never been written, which is the only reason for the film's failure. In the end, because the apartment was bombed, all the women realized it and united to go to the front line, which also seemed unnatural and formulaic. However, having said that, we must also forgive the writers and directors, as it is a very difficult thing to perform a play with all women.

Cantonese Movie

Also known as the Romantic Maid, it is a fun story from a tyrannical family in a warlord era in Guangdong, describing a rich master who, in addition to having three wives and four concubines, also actively pursues servants, resulting in many romantic affairs. The author's original intention is, on the one hand, to describe the ugly history of the old big family, and on the other hand, to try to help the servants in the old family with their suffering. I believe that this kind of thing was often discovered in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China. Therefore, this play can be said to be a practical description. The writers and directors are very diligent from beginning to end, and the performance results are also good.

### On Literature

— Yun Fu

Japanese culture is in prison.

The fascist warlords have long since used the iron rod until it's worn out: several years ago, Kobayashi Takiji and many others were beaten to death in the sinister hell. After August 13th, Nakano Shigeji, who was as famous as Kobayashi, female writer Chujo Yuriko, as well as the aged literary authority Akita Ujaku, Eguchi Kan, and others have all been imprisoned one after another. The warlords are very cautiously preserving culture with iron chains.

The pathetic Tokunaga Sunao, however, uses alcohol to numb his nerves, fortunately avoiding imprisonment; but he deeply feels the pain of being mute. Tonamura Shiro and Kurahara Korehito temporarily stopped their translation work, waiting quietly for the volcano to erupt.

In addition, the military aggressively spurs on a group of shameless things. Speculator Hayashi Fusao and Sato Haruo appear to be active. The talks at the "Literary Discussion Group" are very earnest, but cannot hide the cowering trembling of the patriots (?). What are they doing? Although Kikuchi Kan's "Bungei Shunju" has removed the traces of "triangles and squares," he continues to engage in the work of "temporary excitement," and the effect of the old literature is exactly the same as before: the government also organized a "Pen Warriors Group" hosted by Kume Masao, joyfully coming to China, and some "warriors" were so frightened by the sound of cannons that they ran away.

Naturally, seven years ago, they also participated in the procession of welcoming the loyal remains of deceased soldiers back to court: wearing command swords, shouting orders, holding boxes wrapped in yellow silk, the faces of those triumphant warriors on the Shanghai battlefield were undoubtedly heroic, so they sighed and sang alongside them, moved to tears by the rhythm of "Kimitoyo,"... In the meantime, they cleverly neutralized the people's genuine tears of bitterness, singing praises of "death's victory" with an arrogant posture; but the literature is still a duck egg.

This time, the situation has changed, although it is still a duck egg: Ishikawa Tatsuzo vaguely sheds tears of despair for a group of "undead soldiers": their own ashes are not heard of returning to court, how long will the war be prolonged? Thus, "Undead Soldiers" eventually caused a storm in their own country. Then came punishment; finally: redeem oneself through meritorious service! The warlords know that "culture is in prison" and there is no one outside.

The "Pen Warriors" will understand under their feet that they are accustomed to relying on the old experience of "Kimitoyo" to boast in their own country's newspapers, deceiving the masses who lack tears. Ishikawa Tatsuzo ended up adding a tail to his own body, playing too narrowly.

It is also not surprising that the "Pen Warriors" are not competent, unable to sing praises in an extravagant and vigorous manner, still containing the tone of sobbing; because the subject matter is like this, it cannot be reversed. The literature here is outside the "Pen Warriors Group":

Same script, same race, originally friends like brothers;

The evil demon warlords, creating bottomless, deep hatred.

Rushing, slaughtering, millions of people turned to ash,

How can punishment not descend upon the devil's hand?

The blue sky and white sun shine upon the earth, the peaceful blue clouds of the world, when will they unfold?

Millions of blind eyes open in the artillery fire.

Beloved wife - we want to intertwine and be intimate, but this life is difficult to repeat.

(See Quanzhou 20th telegram)

The author of this song's air defense telegram is very clear about the fear of Yamada Saburo: ashes cannot be brought back is inevitable: the unbroken lineage of all ages will collapse with its clay feet.

From then on, singing praises of "loyal remains returning to court" has become a historical relic, and the tail of the "Pen Warriors" will sooner or later become a beautiful pattern on a fossil.

Yamada Saburo will be sentenced to capital punishment and will have to go to prison again, practicing his "difficult to repeat this life," but this is really a pity, their group should walk the road to hell. Is being a great singer of justice the most glorious? What flies outside the prison is freedom, the blue sky, white sun.

Naturally, the pain of "difficult to repeat this life" cannot be relieved without this; the comforting of the conscripted monks among the "Undead Soldiers" is futile, and transcendence is also a duck egg. One hand holding Buddhist beads, the other holding a steel shovel will surely let one's own soul hold one's own ashes, as "loyal remains returning to court." However, where to "return" to? Mount Fuji is about to erupt! It is too far from "achieving Buddhahood." Therefore, I slightly altered Jigong's nirvana poem and shouted it out:

"For a year and a half, it has been a mess, hitting the east wall to the west wall: from now on, pack up and go, never seeing the water connect to the blue sky?"

### Shanghai

— Zheng Yuwei

The Hong Kong wind is really good, but how about Shanghai, which is relatively prosperous? Shanghai, ah, my friend, have you ever missed it?

Life in Hong Kong is strangely comfortable: living in this "safe haven" where you can't hear the sound of cannons, Shanghai, ah, my friend, have you ever missed it?

The former "Paris of the East" has now become a desolate and terrifying isolated island, Shanghai, ah! My friend, have you ever missed it?

Your former second home has now become the nests of × people, ronin, and traitors, Shanghai, ah! My friend, have you ever missed it?

We cannot give up an inch of our land, we vow to restore the integrity of our land, Shanghai, ah, my friend, have you ever missed it?

### Fishing Lights

— Cai Lusheng

When the setting sun kisses the boundless sea waves, the western sky reflects a brilliant sunset glow, crows hurriedly sweep across this twilight sea and sky, and groups of fishing boats return from the sea, connected to each other. Amidst the sound of oars and sails, the night air gradually pervades the entire earth, filling the entire sea and sky, and all the scenery becomes indistinguishable from blurry, marking the beginning of night.

Countless fishing boats anchored in every harbor of the East Bo Liao Strait have a flickering mast light hanging on each boat's mast. High and low, thousands of lights, like cold fireflies, rest on this dark sea surface, twinkling with the stars in the vast sea and sky.

Following the flow of the night wind in the strait, the sea occasionally brings a burst of undulating, weeping and pleading "saltwater song," making people fully aware of the fishermen's historical and current suffering, and offering them infinite sympathy.

Since the bloody smell of war blew into the South China Sea, in order to protect the most beautiful gem on her crown, how many demonstration-like military exercises have been held. The tranquil night is often shaken by the sound of cannons and the roar of airplanes, and silvery-white "giant flames" dart back and forth across the dark space, searching for its target. The barking of dogs on the shore and on the water further deepens the horror of the night!

Near the sandy shore, three or two fishing boats are lying horizontally, repairing and scrubbing their bottoms, preparing to go out to sea. Several sparks from the fires used to bake the bottom of the boats burn around them. From the reflection of the firelight, you can clearly see that each boat's stern is pasted with some red, gold-edged paper strips, on which are written auspicious words commonly used on the water, such as "Smooth Sailing and Profit" or "Floating Residence Auspicious." A dim kerosene lamp hangs on the deck, and one or two earthen cannons are quietly placed beside the cabin, ready to retaliate against any attacker. Although its ancient and majestic appearance has lost its effectiveness in modern times, it still cannot but command solemn respect.

×××××××××, ××××××××, although it is the arrival of the "peak month," most fishing boats, in helplessness, can only cruise within the pitifully small Hong Kong territorial waters, engaging in minimal fishing. Very few fishing boats actually go out to sea. Even those who venture out find it difficult to guarantee a "smooth sailing and profitable" return—nine times out of ten they encounter × people and end up with the boat wrecked and the people dead. Therefore, most fishing boats have stopped going out to sea and are hiding in the harbor, spending their days in sorrow. The scattered fishing lights are precisely the places where many fishermen are heartbroken, shedding tears, enduring hunger, and suffering.

In the gloomy and silent sea, there occasionally comes a sound of a fishing boat raising its sails and turning its cable shaft. A huge fishing boat breaks the silence of the night and moves slowly. A person you cannot see stands on the quarterdeck, holding burning incense candles and paper ingots, shaking them up and down, worshiping the sky—they are helpless, they cannot get any help from anyone, they are desperately seeking the blessing of vague divine power. Finally, after much pleading, the burning incense candles and paper ingots are thrown into the sea and extinguished. The boat then follows, heading towards the dark and boundless sea, until the light on its mast is swallowed by the dark sea air.

The fishing lights anchored in Tung寮湾 are still shining, the desolate and mournful fishing songs are still floating, life, debt, death, arson, these contradictory thoughts are holding onto the hearts of every simple and honest fisherman...

The fishing lights illuminate the turbulent sea around the boat, and also illuminate their trickling tears.

### "Steak"

— Lu Po

Originally, the term "steak" was already well-known to the general public, especially among the Westernized people in this society. "Steak" is just a very common food—a piece of tenderloin that has been loosened with the back of a knife, pan-fried, and mixed with things like onions, green beans, and potatoes, and then seasoned with a little orange juice and mustard—usually available in every Western restaurant (big cuisine room).

However, what I'm talking about here is a different kind of "steak" with a different flavor. Although it also contains "meat," this is "human" "meat" and not "cow" "meat," and this kind of "meat sale" is only available in the "human meat market."

This "steak" is a "new seasonal dish with the characteristics of the night city" here.

It is the "spiritual" "cheap sale," the "meat" "bargain," and also mixed with "blood" and "tears" "free gifts"!

Whenever the lights are lit, and the movie theaters are over, on the vast streets illuminated by streetlights, in medium-sized bars and Western restaurants, there are usually some women who are strangely dressed and heavily made up, dressed seven parts like not humans and three parts like not ghosts, wandering, lingering, appearing and disappearing...

On each person's bloodless and seemingly emotionless face, a thick layer of white powder is applied. Each withered lip is heavily dyed with lipstick. Although a little smile sometimes floats between the eyebrows and eyes, it is so numb, so unnatural, that one feels at first glance that it is just decoration, just hypocrisy.

Although this smile is false and hypocritical, it is a kind of seductive tool, a medium for the "sale of flesh." Whenever a passerby passes by them, they usually skillfully throw over an eye wave, an eye wave with that pretended and hypocritical smile.

However, when they see at a glance that those passing by are not "foreigners" in "military" attire and "cheerful voices," they may immediately lower their faces. This may not be because their dog eyes look down on people, but because they intuitively realize that those who come are not the patrons they hoped for. They all feel that giving you this "glance" of "goodwill" is a waste, is in vain.

Sometimes, when those "foreigners" like "dumb cows" really come, after that moment of "glancing," there is further solicitation. Some who are quick-witted, with a few "words," also have "things going as desired." Then, a small hand "scoops over" from under the waist, and a thick arm "hooks over" from the shoulder, and the "buyer" and the "seller" "hook and scoop" like this to complete their final transaction.

### Review of Literary Front, Volume 2, Issue 7

— Wen Hui

Volume 2, Issue 7 of Literary Front is presented to us in a very substantial manner. What is most worth pointing out there is Ding Ling's "Night in Ji Village." She writes about the mistakes made by a guerrilla team (which has not yet grown strongly into a model combat team) in violating the principles of the anti-Japanese united front. They did not use political work to correct and win over the irregular scattered troops, but gave them an inappropriate measure, as the author's note says: "Guerrilla warfare is good, but inevitably there are occasional bad places, so it exposes those 'bad places,' but this objective reality is expressed through the author's subjective grasp. What we should emphasize is the educational nature of this work; literary workers should make greater efforts in this direction. Xiao Manruo's 'Sacrifice Spirit' attempts to use satire to portray a new bureaucrat in the war of resistance—Chief Zeng ×. This kind of 'new wartime bureaucrat, new warmonger making national crisis money' (Mao Dun) is as harmful as a traitor and should have his 'portrait' drawn. The theme of Xiao Manruo's creation lies in this place. The protagonist in the work—Chief Zeng ×—he both works at the front line and is extremely afraid of death, hiding whenever he hears the sound of airplanes; but he is willing to have 'eternal war' so that he can 'work forever' and earn 168,000 yuan in twenty years. We feel that this character has too much contradiction, making people feel unrealistic and failing to achieve the success of 'typical creation.'"

Mao Dun's short essay "Overcoming Formalism" is actually an in-depth and simple "theory of the typical," which is also the most accurate creative guidance. He indicates "the order of a work from conception to maturity to final production." When the character is in the process of conception, "of course A is no longer the original simple A, and B is no longer the original simple B, but A has B in it, and B also has A in it, becoming another C that is neither A nor B but similar to A and B." This is the "conception" of the "typical." "We try to consciously analyze the character of this C, and try to analyze the meaning of those events from the actions within it (that is, the things that have happened centered on people like A and B). The result is the discovery of A and B," "we plan to write something with AB as the topic." Here, our creative sequence is first "synthesis," then "analysis," and then a new "synthesis."——Let's not mistake it; A or B are to be the "material" of the work, not the "theme" of the work, so it is ultimately after new "synthesis." He continues, "First determine A or B (this may be obtained by reading social science papers, or critical papers) and then go find 'characters' and find 'events,' the result is that you can also write a work, but there is often a danger of formalism." This short essay provides the basic rules for writers' creation.

Du Ai's "On the New Situation and the Strengthening of Writers' Life Practice" is a relatively large and solid paper. However, the author only generally discusses the new political situation, but does not discuss it in the specific category of the 'new form of labor' on the literary front. Literary theorists should pay attention to and deeply and broadly discuss this essential issue. I think it would be more concrete and essential to clearly stipulate the topic as how the literary front can cooperate with the new stage.

Turning to the short collection of random notes and reports, three of them are about the fall of Guangzhou before and after. Although they appear rough in art, the main purpose is to expose (simply and quickly), and the secondary purpose is the artistic technique. This can show "deep mountains and vast swamps" and "everything is strange"; therefore, abandoning "typical" and taking "type" is necessary in the task and needs of the war of resistance literature.

Ai Qing's "To the Painters" expresses the author's heartbroken dissatisfaction with the backwardness of "modeling art" (except for emerging woodcuts). He points out that "traditional Chinese painting has consistently betrayed the welfare of the people, serving the entertainment of the powerful in everything and striving for the satisfaction of individual self-deception." He calls on painters to "fight with the old traditions, fight with the philistine artistic tendencies, and dedicate themselves to serving the broad masses of people and serving the fighting will of awakened humanity." The author's painful whipping of the lagging modeling art workers is also the greatest need at this time, and the literary world's support and help for the painting world should be further expanded.

Ren Jun's short play "Before Departure" has somewhat contrived plots, but in the new wilderness, it is like sweet rain in the desert.
